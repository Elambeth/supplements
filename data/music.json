      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Treatment options for those living with chronic respiratory disease includes non-pharmacological therapies to maximize outcomes. However, some individuals are limited by their symptoms, which inhibit their ability to benefit to an equivalent or expected level. Both music therapy and music medicine are therapeutic approaches which could address these limitations. AREAS COVERED: This perspective reviews the clinical effects of music therapy and music medicine in chronic respiratory diseases. This considers active music therapy methods of re-creating (group singing), improvisation (instrument playing), receptive music listening and music medicine, with a specific focus at rest and during exercise. EXPERT COMMENTARY: The precise role of music therapy or music medicine as an adjunct to exercise testing or structured exercise programs for people with chronic respiratory disease is unclear. Choice of music (for background or individual use for this purpose) requires input from participants and would benefit from music therapists to guide selection. While preliminary findings of group singing and instrument playing highlight some efficacy, their role in comparison to pulmonary rehabilitation requires further clarification. At present, these music therapy and music medicine approaches can be considered as adjunct therapies which may assist in managing symptoms and improving wellbeing alongside existing management strategies."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Depression is a common mental disorder, and traditional treatments are often associated with side effects, making it particularly important to identify safe and effective alternative therapies. As a non-invasive intervention, music therapy has attracted increasing attention in the field of mental health in recent years. Methods: This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of music interventions in alleviating depressive symptoms through a systematic review of their effects on a rat model of depression. The databases PubMed, Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and Ovid MEDLINE were searched for publications dated between January 2010 and November 2024. Results: First, the construction methods and behavioral test approaches used in depressive rat models were introduced and analyzed. Second, the effects of music on the physiological and biochemical indexes, as well as the neural structure and function of depressed rats, were discussed. The types of music influencing depressive behaviors in rats were also summarized and discussed. Finally, current concerns and challenges in translating music therapy into clinical applications for depression were reviewed, alongside future prospects for its development. Conclusions: It is anticipated that this review will pave the way for both basic research and the clinical application of music therapy in the treatment of depression."

      "abstract": "AIMS: To assess the effect of music therapy in improving chronic pain (CP), anxiety, depression, and quality of life using randomized controlled trials, and to explore the role of various moderators in MT effectiveness. DESIGN: Systematic review and Meta-analysis. METHODS: We systematically searched four electronic databases for randomized controlled trials that investigated the effects of music therapy on chronic pain, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. We performed a Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment and calculated the pooled standard mean difference in the outcomes of the test and control groups after the intervention period. RESULTS: Nine randomized controlled trials were retrieved that included a total of 787 patients. Music therapy significantly reduced CP in the test group compared with that in the control group post-intervention and depression, no evidence was observed for improvement in anxiety and quality of life. Subgroup analysis reveals that MT is most effective when interventions are conducted in developed countries, targeting CNMP or cancer pain patients in health centers. The therapy is most effective when patients select their own music, use instruments or earphones, and receive treatment from trained professionals, with an ideal duration of 20 min, except in studies involving postoperative CP or those conducted in developing countries. CONCLUSIONS: Music therapy effectively reduces CP and depression, but has limited effects on anxiety and quality of life. Its effectiveness varies depending on the specific conditions and CP categories of patients, with differences observed between developing and developed countries. Future research should focus on developing standardized guidelines for music therapy, exploring its long-term effects on pain, anxiety, and quality of life, and conducting high-quality, multicenter RCTs in developing countries to support its global adoption in CP management.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Frail older adults need to improve their health through exercise, and effective interventions are necessary to ensure their participation. Exercise with music has been shown to enhance adherence among older adults and improve both physical and mental health outcomes, making it a suitable intervention for frail older adults. This study evaluated the impact of exercise with music on the physical and emotional health of frail, community-dwelling older adults. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Google Scholar and the Virginia Henderson International Nursing Library were last searched on 14 March 2025. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs that applied exercise with music to community-dwelling frail older adults. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Five independent reviewers used standardised methods to search, screen and code included studies. Study quality was assessed using the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool and the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions tool. A meta-analysis and narrative synthesis were conducted, and the findings were summarised using Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation evidence profiles. Publication bias was checked, and sensitivity analyses were used to assess the robustness of the results. RESULTS: After screening the initial 1425 studies, 17 studies (13 RCTs and 4 non-RCTs) were analysed. The overall risk of bias indicated that two had high risk and three had serious risk among the RCTs, and two had serious risk and two had moderate risk among the non-RCTs included in the meta-analysis. As for physical health outcomes, studies reported on frailty, Timed Up and Go (TUG), handgrip strength, falls, balance, gait speed, endurance and other performance. As for emotional health outcomes, studies reported on depression, social support and activities, quality of life or satisfaction and cognitive function. The pooled analysis suggested that exercise with music may have a positive effect on reducing frailty (standardised mean difference (SMD)=-0.20, 95% CI=-0.34 to -0.07, p=0.003, I2=0%; very low certainty) and decreasing depression levels (SMD=-0.40, 95% CI=-0.65 to -0.15, p=0.002, I2=0%; very low certainty) compared with control group outcomes in non-RCTs. However, there was no effect on the TUG and handgrip strength. A narrative synthesis of evidence suggested potential beneficial effects on frailty and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise with music may help improve frail older adults' physical and emotional health and potentially reduce the burden of frailty. However, further rigorous investigation is needed, as the evidence has a very low level of certainty. Additionally, results from this review should be interpreted with caution because of concerns associated with the risk of bias. Community-based health professionals should consider using music when providing exercise interventions to frail older adults, while applying tailored approaches that consider their unique needs.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Prehabilitation aims to improve preoperative health before surgery to reduce complications. Reducing anxiety helps prevent postoperative pain, stress and sleep disturbances. Listening to music through headphones or earpieces in the hospital directly preoperatively, intraoperatively and postoperatively has been shown to ameliorate anxiety, stress, pain and sleep disorders. This randomised controlled trial will investigate the effect of active music listening at home 1 week before surgery as a prehabilitation modality on preoperative anxiety compared with standard care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a multicentre randomised controlled trial that will include 116 patients. The study population consists of adults undergoing elective oncological colorectal surgery. The intervention group will be advised to listen to recorded music three times per day for 20 min, starting 1 week prior to surgery, using headphones or earpieces. Both groups will receive standard care during hospitalisation. The primary outcome is patient-reported preoperative anxiety using the State-Trait Anxiety IndexInventory 6. Secondary outcomes are patient-reported stress, delirium incidence, medication usage, postoperative pain, complication rate, length of stay, adherence to the intervention, quality of life and healthcare-related costs. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study protocol has been approved by the Medical Ethical Review Board of Erasmus Medical Center on 15 December 2022 (MEC-2022-9415). The trial will be carried out following the updated Declaration of Helsinki principles and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Study results will be published and reported in a peer-reviewed journal according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05982184.",

It included 483 girls aged 10-14 who participated in the Healing in Harmony (HiH) program, implemented by World Vision and Make Music Matter in Kasai-Central province. Participants completed surveys before and after the program, and up to two follow-up interviews assessing depression, anxiety, self-esteem, and school attendance. Before the program, 36.0% (95% CI 31.7%-40.3%) and 60.5% (95% CI 56.1%-64.8%) screened positive for depression and anxiety, respectively. After participation, the risk of screening positive declined by 75% for depression (RR = 0.27, 95% CI 0.22-0.32) and by about half for anxiety (RR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.41-0.53), with improvements sustained up to 17 months. Self-esteem scores increased by 3.93 points (95% CI 3.22-4.64, p<0.001). School absenteeism decreased from 10% (95% CI 7.2%-12.6%) to 5.4% (RR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.40-0.73). Participation in HiH was associated with sustained improvements in mental health and school attendance. These findings support integrating psychosocial care into humanitarian responses to improve both mental health and educational outcomes for crisis-affected children."

However, the lack of sustainable gait interventions that collectively promote sufficient intensity, daily amount, and quality of walking marks a critical gap in PD rehabilitation. In this randomized controlled trial (clinicaltrials.gov#: NCT05421624, registered on June 6, 2022), we demonstrate the effectiveness of a real-world walking intervention delivered using an autonomous music-based digital rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) system. In comparison to an active-control arm (N = 20) of moderately intense brisk walking, the autonomous RAS system used in the experimental arm (N = 21) amplified moderate-to-vigorous walking intensities, increased daily steps, and improved (reduced) gait variability. While regular engagement in real-world walking with or without RAS each cultivated habits for walking, only the RAS intervention yielded a combination of strengthened habits and improved gait outcomes. Findings from this study supported the use of a personalized, autonomous RAS gait intervention that is effective, habit-forming and translatable to real-world walking in individuals with PD."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Listening to music during pregnancy is associated with better neonatal behavior; however, contributions of prenatal singing to neonatal behavior are still unknown. Also, contributions of acoustic propagation of maternal humming inside the womb on fetal and neonatal behavior are still not understood. METHODS: Low obstetric risk pregnant women (N = 24) were sequentially allocated into three groups: 1) control group (CG) without prenatal singing; 2) music therapy group (MTG); and 3) vocal training group (VTG). Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS) and Antenatal Maternal Attachment Scales were applied at 32 GW and also at 37 GW. DASS, Postnatal Maternal Attachment Scales, and Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) were applied between one week and one month after birth. RESULTS: For MTG: prenatal attachment was improved at 37 GW; newborns range of state was higher when compared with CG newborns; lower scores of anxiety and of stress assessed at 37 GW were associated with higher neonatal autonomic regulation; after birth, lower maternal levels of depression were associated with newborns' higher social orientation. For VTG: anxiety assessed at 37 GW associated negatively with social orientation; after birth, DASS total score associated negatively with autonomic regulation. CONCLUSION: MTG seems to favor prenatal attachment, and neonatal range of state. Apparently prenatal singing (present at both MTG and VTG) improves the association between maternal mental health and newborns' social and self-regulatory competencies."

Therefore, we studied the influence of music for patients with preoperative anxiety and postoperative pain, in order to provide an effective and safe non-pharmacological intervention for patients. METHOD: Studies on music and gynecological operation were searched in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. NOS and the modified Jadad Scale were used to evaluate the quality of the studies, and the evidence quality was evaluated and graded according to GRADE guidelines. Stata 12.0 software was used for data analysis. RESULTS: We compared the difference in preoperative anxiety between the experimental group and the control group. The results showed that anxiety symptoms were significantly relieved in the experimental group that listened to music(WMD = -6.78, 95% CI (-7.54 - -6.03), P = 0.000). This difference was statistically significant, and the quality of evidence was rated as intermediate. We compared the difference in anxiety symptoms before and after listening to music in the experimental group (WMD = -4.39, 95% CI (-5.14 - -3.64), P = 0.000). The results indicated a significant relief in anxiety symptoms after listening to music. The difference was statistically significant, and the quality of evidence was rated as intermediate and low, respectively. We compared the differences in postoperative pain between the experimental group and the control group (WMD = -0.26, 95% CI (-0.43--0.10), P = 0.002). The results showed that the pain symptoms of the experimental group, who listened to music, were significantly relieved. The difference was statistically significant, and the quality of evidence was rated as intermediate. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis showed that listening to music significantly improved preoperative anxiety and postoperative pain during gynecological surgery. Therefore, operating room nurses should perform music intervention in patients undergoing gynecological surgery before and after surgery.",

METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted on 100 patients with ankle fractures, all of whom were admitted to Nanjing First Hospital between January 2019 and December 2021. Patients were treated with open reduction and internal fixation. According to whether the patients received music therapy or not, they were grouped into the music therapy group and the conventional group, each comprising 50 cases. The recovery time, rehabilitation efficacy, ankle range of motion (ROM), pain level (Numerical Rating Scale [NRS]) and quality of life (World Health Organization Quality of Life Evaluation Questionnaire [WHOQOL-BREF]) were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The postoperative ambulation time, fracture healing time, hospital stay and total effective rate showed no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). Two months after surgery, the plantarflexion, dorsiflexion, inversion and eversion range of the two groups significantly increased compared with that before the intervention, but the ankle ROM showed no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). The NRS scores of the music therapy group at 7, 14 and 28 days after surgery were significantly lower than those of the conventional group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the WHOQOL-BREF scores of psychological function, physical function, social function and material life dimensions in the music therapy group were significantly higher than those in the conventional group (P < 0.05).

METHODS: In this retrospective study, 120 adolescents with depression who visited the Wenzhou Seventh People's Hospital between June 2022 and June 2024 were selected and categorized into the music therapy group and a conventional group (60 cases in each group). The conventional group received FSS-assisted treatment and conventional medication, whereas the music therapy group was given music therapy based on the conventional treatment. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA), Family Assessment Device (FAD), Adolescent Self-Rating Life Events Checklist (ASLEC), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: After treatment, the decrease in HAMD and HAMA scores was significantly greater in the music therapy group than in the conventional group (P < 0.05). The FAD score in the music therapy group improved more significantly in dimensions such as problem-solving, communication, emotional involvement, behavior control, and overall function than that of the conventional group (P < 0.05). The ASLEC score showed a greater reduction in aspects such as interpersonal relationships, academic stress, punishment, and loss (P < 0.05). The PSQI score improved more significantly with regard to subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep disorders, hypnotic drug use, and daytime dysfunction (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Integrating music therapy into FSS can effectively reduce depression and anxiety symptoms in adolescents with depression, improve the family and psychosocial function, and enhance sleep quality. However, further studies are still needed to verify and improve this approach.",

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of 170 COPD patients admitted to Second Affiliated Hospital of Naval Medical University (Shanghai Changzheng Hospital) from February 2022 to February 2023. The patients were divided into three groups in accordance with nursing care methods. The control group (n = 55) received conventional nursing care, group A (n = 58) received respiratory specialty care and group B (n = 57) received five-element music-based psychological intervention combined with respiratory specialty care. Nursing effectiveness was evaluated 6 months after discharge. Medical compliance, inflammatory indicators, lung function indicators [vital capacity (VC), peak expiratory flow (PEF) rate, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC)], 6-minute walk test (6MWT) distance, negative emotions, and quality of life were compared among the three groups. RESULTS: Groups A and B received higher scores in medical compliance and had higher VC, PEF, and FEV1/FVC levels than the control group (P < 0.05). The serum C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and procalcitonin levels in groups A and B were lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). In addition, their 6MWT distance was longer than that of the control group (P < 0.05). No significant difference was found in inflammatory indicators, lung function indicators, and 6MWT distance between group A and group B (P > 0.05). The scores of the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, Hamilton Depression Scale, and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire in group B were lower than those in group A and the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Five-element music-based psychological intervention combined with respiratory specialty care can significantly alleviate negative emotions in COPD patients and improve their quality of life.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Objective This study aimed to investigate the effects of music therapy combined with habit reversal training (HRT) on children with tic disorders. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on the clinical data of 122 children diagnosed with chronic tic disorders admitted to Hebei Children's Hospital Affiliated to Hebei Medical University from January 2021 to January 2024. According to different treatment methods, patients were separated into the HRT group (n = 55), who received routine HRT, and the music therapy group (n = 67), who received music therapy combined with HRT. The baseline data before treatment and the clinical efficacy after 8 weeks of treatment of the two groups were compared. Before and after the 8-week treatment, the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) scores, serum neurotransmitter levels, Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: After an 8-week treatment, the Global Severity Score and Total Tic Score of YGTSS significantly decreased in both groups, with the music therapy group showing lower scores than the HRT group (P < 0.05). The total effective rate in the music therapy group was higher than that in the HRT group (92.54% vs. 80.00%, P < 0.05). Serum dopamine and serotonin levels significantly decreased after treatment in both groups, with the music therapy group showing lower levels than the HRT group (P < 0.05). Conversely, serum γ-aminobutyric acid levels significantly increased after treatment in both groups, with the music therapy group showing higher levels than the HRT group (P < 0.05). The CBCL and PedsQL scores significantly improved after treatment in both groups, with the music therapy group showing a significant decrease in CBCL scores and a significant increase in PedsQL scores compared with the HRT group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Music therapy combined with HRT significantly enhanced treatment efficacy for children with tic disorders. It reduced tic severity, improved behavioral outcomes, and modulated neurotransmitter levels. The study demonstrated the potential clinical value of music therapy as a nonpharmacological treatment for tic disorders.",

Although music as an environmental intervention can alleviate short-term stress injury, its long-term regulatory mechanism on intestinal inflammation has not been clarified. In this study, we investigated the effects of a music-enriched environment on growth performance, intestinal barrier function, and inflammatory responses in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced immunostressed broilers. AA broilers were randomly divided into four groups: control group (CON), music-enriched environment group (MUC), LPS-induced immune stress group (LPS) and music-enriched environment + LPS group (MUC+LPS). On the 14th, 16th and 18th days, the LPS and MUC+LPS groups were injected intraperitoneally with 500 μg of LPS to construct an immune stress model, and the CON and MUC groups were injected with an equal amount of saline. On day 28, the birds were sacrificed to detect the indicators associated with intestinal barrier and inflammation. The LPS group showed a significant decrease in performance from 14 to 28 days, with elevated serum levels of CORT, ACTH, DAO, and d-LA, and a decrease in the activity of intestinal mucosal SOD/GSH-Px, and impaired gut morphology. impaired; music remission significantly alleviated the decline in production performance, reduced the levels of stress hormones and markers of intestinal barrier damage, while elevating jejuno-ileal GSH-Px activity and improving intestinal morphology. Significant inflammatory gene expression characteristics were observed in jejunum and ileum tissues after LPS injection: upregulation of TLR4, NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, and significant suppression of jejunal IL-10 expression. Notably, IL-10 and IFN-γ expression in the ileum did not show statistical differences. Inflammation-related gene expression showed an overall down-regulation trend after the music intervention, but was still significantly different from the control group. Music intervention on the regulation of jejunal MYD88 and ileal TNF-α - the LPS group did not show statistically significant differences in the expression of these two key inflammatory nodes with the LPS+MUS group. Mechanistic studies have shown that LPS triggers an oxidative stress cascade through activation of the TLR4/NF-κB signaling axis, leading to disruption of intestinal barrier integrity. In contrast, music exposure exerts a protective effect through a dual mechanism: on the one hand, it helps to enhance the expression of the tight junction protein ZO-1/Occludin to repair the physical barrier; on the other hand, it inhibits the activation of the TLR4/NF-κB pathway, which can effectively alleviate LPS-induced immunopathological damage."

Here we report feasibility of a music-based intervention that is coupled with light entrainment in the gamma band, as well as a control intervention that pairs podcast listening with lights tuned to delta but not gamma band frequencies. We compare qualitative data from participant-maintained logbooks (diaries) and researcher notes using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, specifically word count and sentiment analysis, and show that while both music-listening and podcast-listening participants were able to complete the interventions, participants in the podcast intervention wrote more words in their logbooks.

This systematic review explores the relationship between ASD and music therapy, examining factors that influence its effectiveness in children. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 2009 and 2024 was conducted to assess the effects of music therapy on children with autism. Studies were retrieved from databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar, with the final search completed by October 1, 2024, and only RCTs that evaluated music's impact on ASD and reported relevant outcomes were included, while non-RCTs, studies with a high risk of bias, and duplicates were excluded. A total of nine RCTs involving 1,327 children with ASD, aged 2-12, were analyzed; these studies assessed various music therapy interventions lasting from two weeks to eight months, with sessions occurring one to three times per week. Findings were mixed, as four studies with 449 participants reported significant improvements in social communication skills, while three larger studies with 715 participants found no significant changes in primary social outcomes but noted improvements in specific aspects of social responsiveness, and two smaller studies with 59 participants reported notable enhancements in verbal production and emotional responsiveness. Music therapy has been recognized as a beneficial intervention for improving health outcomes across various conditions, including mental health disorders, and this review highlights its potential in autism, particularly in enhancing cognitive processing, emotional responses, and social communication; however, while the findings are promising, further research with larger sample sizes and extended study durations is necessary to validate these effects."

Research has shown that a bundle containing sedation awakening and spontaneous breathing trials, appropriate choice of sedatives, early mobilization, and family engagement was associated with a reduced rate of delirium. Music listening and music therapy have also been studied, showing promising results for anxiety and pain control, but have not been studied in terms of preventing delirium. METHODS: As part of a quality improvement project, we implemented a protocol of music listening and music therapy for mechanically ventilated patients. The rate of delirium, ICU and ventilator lengths of stay, and mortality were compared between groups (n = 17 protocol, n = 50 control). RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in demographic characteristics, severity of illness, medical comorbidities, or cumulative doses of sedating medications between the groups. The rate of delirium between groups was not statistically significantly different (11.8% vs 16%, P = 0.70). Severity of illness based on APACHE IV score was statistically associated with mortality (estimate coefficient 0.03, P = 0.015), and use of dexmedetomidine was statistically associated with prolonged ICU and ventilator lengths of stay. CONCLUSION: The music therapy and music listening protocol did not show a reduction of the delirium rate for mechanically ventilated patients."

This study's finding shows that cognitive behaviour therapy combined with art and music delivered through interactive media may be superior for treating paediatric GAD, than using only either CBT, art or music therapy. Participants who were assigned to a combined therapy that involved integrating CBT, music and art therapies reported a lower level of GAD, compared to those who were assigned to either CBT, art, or music alone. However, a cost benefit analysis points to the adopting of CBT in treating the GAD of children kidnapped. This study concluded with some implication for theory and health promotion."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Venipuncture is a routine procedure in pediatrics that often elicits pain and triggers adverse emotional responses. The stress, both psychological and physiological, that accompanies this procedure can significantly impair pediatric patients' compliance with medical regimens. To mitigate these effects, music therapy as a non-pharmacological approach known for its safety has been increasingly employed in pediatric settings. There is empirical evidence supporting the efficacy of music therapy in reducing procedural pain and in easing negative emotions experienced by pediatric patients. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of music therapy in managing pain, anxiety and distress in pediatric patients undergoing venipuncture procedures. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus, CINAHL, EBSCO and FMRS databases for articles published up to December 20, 2024. Two reviewers independently selected studies and extracted articles that met strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Quality assessments of the included studies were performed according to the Cochrane risk assessment tool, data analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies including 657 participants in the intervention group and 707 participants in the control group were selected for the final analysis. The results demonstrated a significant difference between the music groups and control groups for children's self-reported pain (standard mean difference SMD = -0.42, 95 % CI -0.58 to -0.27, P < 0.05), observer-reported pain (SMD = -0.52, 95 % CI -0.87 to -0.17, P < 0.05) and distress (SMD = -0.70, 95 % CI -1.27 to -0.13, P = 0.02). However, no significant difference was observed in anxiety (SMD = -0.10, 95 % CI -0.32 to 0.13, P = 0.41). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients undergoing venipuncture procedures would benefit from music interventions for pain and distress relief. However, no statistically significant effect was found on anxiety. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews CRD42024509600."

In this pilot trial, we aimed to establish whether using slow and fast music of positive valence in a caregiver-delivered MBI results in differential effects. Methods: 17 person-with-dementia-and-caregiver dyads were randomised. Dyads underwent 6-week periods of two music listening interventions, 'MBI A' (consisting of fast, positively valenced music) and 'MBI B' (slow, positively valenced music). The order of these was crossed-over. Half of the dyads also completed a control intervention (6-week care-as-usual). People with dementia listened on tablets or CDs provided. Quantitative assessments included person with dementia outcomes (cognition, well-being, quality of life) and caregiver-reported outcomes (behavioural and psychiatric symptom severity and related distress). Dyads' descriptions of experiences were also recorded. Results: MBI A was associated with superior delayed recall compared to MBI B (MBI A- B: 1.04 [95% CI: 0.16, 1.92], p = .028, Hedge's gav = 0.70). Dyads' descriptions highlight 'in-the-moment' effects of the MBIs. Positive effects of MBI A included heightened mood and movement (e.g. clapping), MBI B was associated with relaxation. Conclusions: The positive effect of MBI A on delayed recall performance suggests that fast, positively valenced music may be explored further to support cognition in people with dementia. Dyads' reports underline the value of music listening to the momentary well-being of people with dementia."

      "abstract": "Catechol, also known as pyrocatechol, is a widespread antioxidant carcinogen that has been shown to cause central nervous system damage and metabolic abnormalities, and in zebrafish, it has been shown that exposure to aqueous solutions of catechol results in reduced pigmentation and decreased basal locomotor rate in juvenile zebrafish. However, the effects of catechol on zebrafish redox and behaviour are unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of catechol on oxidative stress levels in early zebrafish development and on behaviour in later stages of zebrafish development and to attempt to intervene in this effect with music therapy. We exposed zebrafish adults and juveniles to catechol separately, tested zebrafish juveniles for various redox indices and found that zebrafish juveniles had increased levels of reactive oxygen species and decreased total antioxidant capacity and lipid peroxidation capacity, and we tested zebrafish adults for behavioural studies and found that anxiety behaviours increased as social cohesion decreased. We then conducted a music therapy intervention for catechol exposure in adult zebrafish and found that music therapy exacerbated catechol-induced behavioural abnormalities and altered oxidative levels, whether zebrafish were exposed to both catechol and classical music or whether the catechol exposure was followed by a 12-day classical music intervention after 12 days of catechol exposure. In summary, this study revealed for the first time that catechol caused redox imbalance in juvenile zebrafish and socially disturbed, anxious behaviour in adults and found that music treatment worsened this behavioural abnormality. This study provides new insights into the effects of catechol on zebrafish and suggests that the therapeutic effects of music therapy may have a double-edged effect.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is a primary treatment for coronary artery occlusion. Anxiety is a common preoperative concern among patients undergoing this procedure. This study aimed to investigate the effect of listening to traditional Iranian music on anxiety in patients before CABG surgery. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial involved 66 patients scheduled for CABG surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to either the control or intervention group, with 33 patients in each group. The intervention group listened to traditional music on an MP3 player for 20 minutes, while the control group received an MP3 player without music. Anxiety levels were measured using the Spielberger Anxiety Questionnaire before and after the intervention. Data were analyzed using the Student's t-test, the paired t-test, and the Mann-Whitney U-test with SPSS software version 21. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in anxiety severity between the 2 groups before the intervention (music group: 106.45±10.67 and control group: 116.36±9.78; P=0.798). However, after the intervention, there was a significant difference between the groups (music group: 65.82±7.54 vs control group: 113.72±13.04; P=0.001). There were no significant differences in physiological parameters (blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration rate) between the groups before the intervention (P<0.078). Following the intervention, systolic (P<0.013) and diastolic (P<0.003) blood pressure significantly decreased in the intervention group compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: Traditional Iranian music therapy can be a noninvasive, low-cost, and accessible tool to reduce anxiety in patients undergoing CABG surgery."

METHODS: The double-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted from October 2023 to March 2024 at the Department of Operative Dentistry and Endodontics, Dr Ishrat-ul-Ebad Khan Institute of Oral Health Sciences, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, and comprised adult patients undergoing root canal procedure who were randomised into three groups. Group A listened to 432Hz music, group B listened to binaural beats, and control group C listened to white noise. All the patients and the outcome assessors were kept blinded to the randomisation. The Visual Analogue Scale for Anxiety was used to measure anxiety levels before and after the administration of local anaesthesia and 10 minutes after listening to the sounds. The endodontic therapy was done as usual. Data was analysed using SPSS 26. RESULTS: Of the 99 participants, 64(64.6%) were females and 35(35.4%) were males with overall mean age 28.06±7.36 years. All the groups had 33(33.3%) subjects. Intragroup improvement in preoperative anxiety was significant in both interventional groups compared to the baseline value and the control group (p<0.05). No significant difference was found between the interventional groups (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Binaural beats and 432Hz music were found to be highly and equally effective for decreasing preoperative dental anxiety in adult patients undergoing endodontic treatment.

      "abstract": "Background: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are neurodegenerative disorders that afflict 1 in 9 older adults. As pharmacological interventions for ADRD are often ineffective and cause rampant side effects, interest has increased in finding adjunctive, non-pharmacological approaches. Music therapy may be especially beneficial for individuals with ADRD and their caregivers as music is a form of non-verbal communication. Objective: In this case series, we describe a 12-week group music therapy program for individuals with ADRD and their caregivers. Methods: Brain activity was recorded with hyperscanning electroencephalography (EEG) during each music therapy session from the individual with ADRD (n = 3), caregiver (n = 3), and music therapist (n = 1). Video recordings allowed for assessment of movement behavior and affective state responses. Results: This 12-week case series of group music therapy for individuals and their caregivers had a 66% retention and 95.8% adherence rate. We had success collecting behavioral and neural data using 360-degree video capture in combination with EEG. Video recordings allowed us to analyze affective state and nonverbal communication metrics. After pre-processing, neural recordings were clean and able to be analyzed for various neural metrics of interest. Conclusions: A human-centered design approach can be helpful for implementing longitudinal, non-pharmacological interventions in this vulnerable population. A team-science approach with a collective of creative arts therapists, neuroscientists, dementia care experts, creative technologists, and gerontology experts contributed to the conduction of this work. Future studies should examine the effects of music therapy on behavioral and neural outcomes, especially as it relates to interpersonal behavioral and neural synchrony."

This paper is situated in the context of a larger research project which explored how telehealth music therapy can support people with dementia and their family caregivers living in the community. The research was guided by three PPI contributors with dementia with support from their family care partners to ensure the relevance of research outputs for people with dementia living in the community. To capture their experiences of being involved in this research, they collaboratively wrote a song entitled 'We Will Tell Everyone', about living well with dementia and the impact of being involved in dementia research. This paper presents the process of writing the song, the lyrics of the original song, alongside the PPI contributors experiences. Qualitative research using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was undertaken to analyse the process. Three themes emerged: (a) An empowering experience, (b) the importance of collaboration, respect and listening, and (c) a message of hope. This paper demonstrates how arts-based research methods such as songwriting can make research findings more impactful and offers a creative and accessible approach to capture the voices and lived experiences of people with dementia in research."

Both music and mindfulness have been shown to increase HRV, and clinical approaches incorporating these interventions show promise as effective treatments for symptoms of anxiety and depression. Music mindfulness, which combines music listening with mindfulness activities, may provide unique and synergistic therapeutic benefits for stress management. However, to date, no studies have evaluated the physiological mechanisms underlying a community-based music mindfulness paradigm. METHODS: We used wearable technology to record electrocardiography and electroencephalography signals from participants with moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression during a community-based music mindfulness paradigm. We also assessed the impact of our music mindfulness session on participant's psychological state. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We found that music mindfulness sessions acutely enhanced multiple measures of HRV and altered EEG power spectral density across various frequency bands in frontotemporal electrodes. Both live and virtual music mindfulness sessions also acutely reduced stress and altered participants' state of consciousness; however, only live sessions fostered social connection. Additionally, the physiological and psychological effects of music mindfulness varied based on participants' self-reported sex. Overall, our findings demonstrate that music mindfulness effectively engages autonomic and frontotemporal neural mechanisms, which may contribute to the treatment of anxiety and depression symptoms."

      "abstract": "Dental preoperative anxiety poses significant challenges in healthcare, leading to treatment avoidance and prolonged recovery times. Despite the plethora of pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions employed for anxiety management, their relative efficacy remains unclear. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of oral melatonin (6 mg) and music therapy in preoperative anxiety management among patients undergoing surgical extraction of impacted mandibular third molars. A total of 78 patients aged 18-40 years undergoing surgical extraction were selected and randomly assigned into three groups: nil intervention (Group NI) with no intervention, Group ML administered oral melatonin, and Group MT administered 20 min of relaxing music (n = 26). Physiological parameters (pulse rate, blood pressure) and subjective assessments (visual analogue scale for anxiety) were measured on arrival (T1), after the intervention (T2), and after surgical extraction (T3). Salivary cortisol levels, recorded preoperatively and postoperatively, were analysed using ELISA. Results showed significant improvement in physiological parameters for both ML and MT compared with NI (p < 0.05). However, postoperative cortisol levels increased significantly in the NI (0.55 (0.15) - 0.88 (0.32) pmol/ml) and MT groups (from 0.33 (0.15) - 0.62 (0.2) pmol/ml) but decreased in the ML group (from 0.42 (0.19) - 0.3 (0.14) pmol/ml). This indicated a delayed action of melatonin as compared with the immediate impact of music therapy. Understanding the mechanisms and insights obtained can aid in developing advanced anxiety management methods for dental practitioners, thereby enhancing patient care and outcomes in dental practice."

Parent coaching is a specific intervention where primary caregivers learn evidence-based strategies to support their children's development. Virtual music parent coaching has initial evidence of feasibility for families of autistic children. In this study, we used quantitative and qualitative measures to evaluate an 8-week parent coaching program. Feasibility aspects included parental demand, retention, learning, and satisfaction, interventionist's fidelity to the coaching program, and primary caregiver perspectives of outcomes, challenges, and benefits. Results indicated that caregivers learned about the research opportunity mainly through social media, with much lower response to email invitations. Eleven participants enrolled in the study, but 7 completed the program, for a 64% retention rate. Main reasons to drop out were time constraints and other responsibilities. Parents reported a high level of satisfaction and appropriate learning, as well as meaningful changes in their child's communication, understanding their child better, and valuing the accessibility and flexibility of the virtual modality. An interventionist with limited specialized training in autism but appropriate clinical experience achieved fidelity in the parent coaching model quickly. Caregivers' recommendations for improvement included providing recorded examples of the music and tailoring the written materials to each family. Suggestions for future research and practice include prioritizing social media as recruiting medium, evaluating parental disposition and time availability before initiating the program, considering siblings' needs, investigating cost effectiveness, and emphasizing the interventionist's collaborative approach with the parent.",

One of the main considerations of the surgeons for these patients is making them experience a pleasant, comfortable, and painless intervention during septorhinoplasty utilizing nonpharmacological or pharmacological approaches. This study aimed to investigate the antianxiety and analgesic effects of listening to music as a nonpharmacological method in patients undergoing septorhinoplasty with general anesthesia. METHODS: In this randomized controlled clinical trial study, 80 patients who were candidates for septorhinoplasty were randomly categorized into the case (with music) and control groups (without music) from May to September 2022. STATA Version 14.0 (StataCorp) was used for the statistical analysis of the acquired data. Pain perception and agitation were evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Sedation-Agitation Scale (SAS), respectively, and compared between the two groups during the early postoperative period. RESULTS: Although the baseline SAS score in the two groups was similar, findings showed a significantly lower score in the intervention group in recovery units (t-test 4.30, p < 0.001). The mean VAS was 0.8 ± 1.18 and 1.87 ± 1.13 in the intervention and control groups, respectively (p < 0.001). The satisfaction level of those patients in the intervention group was demonstrated during the procedure of the intervention. However, there was no significant difference between the control and intervention groups for hemodynamic parameters. CONCLUSION: Music therapy during surgical procedures can postoperatively simplify the optimized postsurgical outcomes for patients undergoing septorhinoplasty.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews with four corporate leaders and 27 nursing home staff. We used thematic analysis to develop a codebook and map findings to potential adherence moderators in the Conceptual Framework for Implementation Fidelity (CFIF): recruitment, participant responsiveness, strategies to facilitate implementation, intervention complexity, quality of delivery, and context. RESULTS: Recruitment: Corporate leaders noted research participation compensation did support corporate implementation. Resident turnover frequently occurred and led to delays in implementation due to the need to personalize music to each resident. Participant responsiveness (dose received): Interviewees noted the intervention improved dementia behaviors and enhanced engagement with exceptions. Strategies to facilitate implementation: Interviewees voiced differing views on whether nurses or activities staff should lead implementation and how to pilot the program. Intervention complexity: Interviewees described complexities including tailoring delivery to each resident, updating music, and sustainability concerns. Quality of delivery: Champions discussed protocol deviations; e.g., providing residents with music that was not personalized. Context: Interviewees noted how the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic exacerbated turnover, but the intervention did engage residents during staffing shortages. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Interviewees described contextual barriers associated with pragmatic implementation of a personalized music intervention. While they also described facilitators, our findings highlight limits to pragmatic delivery in nursing homes with chronic under-resourcing and staffing, exacerbated by the pandemic."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mental health needs in the community surged during the pandemic, with concerning reports of increased negative mood symptoms among youth. At the same time, preventive psychoeducational interventions were insufficient within frontline youth mental health services in Hong Kong, and research specifically addressing youth loneliness remained limited on an international scale. Given the association between loneliness and other mental health symptoms, psychoeducational programs that empower adolescents to cope with emotions may help address both the research gap and local demand. As such, Tuned In, a previously validated intervention program originally developed in Australia, was introduced to the local context. Cultural adaptations and an added focus on loneliness were incorporated into the project to enhance its acceptability and test its effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate an adapted version of the Tuned In music-based psychoeducation program, designed to reduce loneliness, depression, and anxiety symptoms among young people in Hong Kong by enhancing their emotion regulation skills. METHODS: Participants aged 16-19 years will be randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group. The experimental group will receive an online, group-based psychoeducation program focused on emotion recognition and management, delivered weekly over 4 consecutive weeks. The intervention is grounded in Russell's emotion circumplex model and music psychology, and program content included: The 2D model and characteristics of emotions from different quadrants (session 1); happiness and loneliness (session 2); high-arousal and negative-valence emotions, for example, stress and anxiety (sessions 3); and anxiety, perfectionism, and a celebration of achievement (session 4). Both therapist- and participant-selected music will be used in the intervention to provide a rich repertoire for group discussion, psychoeducation, reflection, and the practice of social skills. The main outcome measures will be assessed using the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, and the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale. Feedback on the project arrangement will be gathered through qualitative input. A mixed methods analysis will be conducted following data collection. RESULTS: The project was successfully funded in February 2023 by the Health and Medical Research Fund in Hong Kong and commenced in August 2023. As of September 16, 2024, a total of 316 completed questionnaires had been received through Qualtrics for screening purposes, with 89 participants deemed eligible for the program. The project is scheduled to conclude in August 2025, with results to be published thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: Participants are expected to show improvements in emotion regulation, along with reductions in mood symptoms and loneliness, following the intervention.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure (HF) pose significant challenges to patients and the health systems that care for them. Music therapy has the potential to address these challenges, but its impact on readmission rates and quality of life remains largely underexplored. This study evaluated the feasibility, fidelity, and acceptability of a hybrid music therapy intervention as a precursor to a randomized controlled trial (RCT). METHODS: Using a single-arm, mixed-methods approach, inpatients aged 30 - 89 with COPD or HF and access to home videoconferencing technology, a mobile device with a data plan, and a reliable support person were recruited during their hospitalizations. Patients with significant hearing/visual impairments, severe psychological comorbidities, terminal medical conditions, stage IV HF, or end-stage COPD were excluded. The intervention included 2 inpatient in-person sessions and 2 virtual sessions following discharge. Feasibility was assessed by rates of recruitment, retention, session attendance, and measure completion. Fidelity was evaluated by adherence to the session protocol, while acceptability was assessed through semi-structured interviews with randomly selected participants. RESULTS: Of 113 patients approached, 20 (17.7%) were enrolled, and 85% were retained. Median participant age was 61.5 years, with 80% having HF and participants having high rates of anxiety (50%) and depression (35%). Overall session attendance was 57.5%, with higher rates for in-person (75%) compared to virtual sessions (40%). Adherence to the intervention protocol was > 80% across all monitored sessions. Challenges with the trial included difficulty reaching participants following discharge, frequent virtual session rescheduling, and participants' challenges using technology. Semi-structured interviews supported the acceptability of the intervention with three emerging themes (1) the therapeutic relationship facilitated a positive intervention experience, (2) need for strategies to improve post-discharge engagement in the intervention, and (3) impacts on mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the feasibility of hybrid music therapy among patients with COPD or HF. However, challenges in post-discharge communication and virtual session attendance were noted. These issues will be addressed in a subsequent feasibility RCT through implementing secure text-based communication in addition to phone communication to reach participants post-discharge, refined eligibility criteria (e.g., excluding patients on dialysis), and in-person technology instruction.

      "abstract": "Anxiety associated with taking exams jeopardizes students' mental and physical health. Complementary alternative methods, such as aromatherapy and music therapy, have shown promise in reducing negative emotions among students. However, few studies have examined the effects of these interventions. This study aimed to investigate the effects of aromatherapy and music therapy on nursing students' blood pressure (BP) and heart rate before taking an exam. This quasi-experimental, double-blinded study was conducted in 2023 at the Nursing College of Abadan University of Medical Sciences in Abadan, Iran. The research included a total of 169 nursing students, who were randomly assigned to three groups: an aromatherapy group (n = 60), a music therapy group (n = 56), and a control group (n = 53). Aromatherapy was administered by inhaling lavender and damask rose essences, while music therapy involved listening to Beethoven's \"Moonlight Sonata.\" The control group received a placebo intervention consisting of cotton soaked in 10 drops of water. Each intervention lasted twenty minutes and was conducted in separate rooms before an exam. Students' heart rates and BP (both systolic and diastolic) were recorded before and after the intervention. The study showed remarkable effects of aromatherapy and music therapy on blood pressure and pulse rate. While systolic blood pressure (SBP) was similar in all groups at the beginning of the study (p = 0.205), SBP decreased significantly after the intervention (p = 0.016), especially in the aromatherapy (p = 0.003) and music therapy (p < 0.001) groups. Both interventions also significantly reduced diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate (p < 0.001) compared to baseline. However, except for SBP (p = 0.021), ANCOVA tests did not reveal significant differences between the study groups for diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate (p > 0.05). The reduction in students' systolic BP before exams, observed with complementary therapies like music therapy and aromatherapy using lavender and damask rose extracts, suggests a decrease in stress-related physiological responses, However, the specific link to exam-related anxiety requires further clarification.",

A quasi-experimental research design was adopted, which included three interventions: BBM, BBM integrated with rhythmical photic stimulation, and relaxation music (control group). Participants completed a questionnaire prior to the first intervention, which included personal demographic information and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. The effects of these interventions on anxiety relief among daycare staff were evaluated through heart rate variability (HRV), brain waves, and blood pressure before and after the interventions. Statistical analysis primarily employed the Friedman test to analyze the differences in changes in HRV, brain waves, and blood pressure before and after the interventions. A total of 40 individuals participated in this study (16 males and 24 females), with an average age of 31.73 ± 8.83 years. The results showed that, compared to BBM alone, BBM integrated with rhythmical photic stimulation significantly reduced the normalized low/high frequency (nLF/nHF) ratio in participants with moderate anxiety (p < 0.05). The results suggest that BBM integrated with rhythmical photic stimulation may serve as an intervention for the prevention and relief of anxiety by regulating an individual's autonomic nervous system. However, further research is required to confirm these findings.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) focused on listening to music might reduce chronic pain and provide a new approach to overcoming challenges from traditional MBIs (e.g., breathing). Due to the potential unpredictability and unfamiliarity of jazz, an MBI focused on listening to improvisational jazz music might be a particularly efficacious pain reduction intervention. This pilot study explores whether mindfully listening to music, including jazz, can reduce pain-related outcomes. METHODS: Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) participants (n=30 per group, N = 120 total) were enrolled online between 12/7/2023 and 2/8/2024. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups in a 2 (Mindful Music Listening/Intervention vs. Music Education/Control) X 2 (Preferred Music (choose their own music genre) vs Jazz (assigned to listen to improvisational jazz)) experiment, for a total of four groups (Mindful Jazz, Mindful Music, Jazz Education, and Music Education). Patients in each group were provided with training in either mindful listening to music (Intervention groups) or music education (Control groups) and given four sets of weekly recordings related to their group for daily listening/practice. Patients completed online surveys on pain-related outcomes (e.g., pain catastrophizing, pain intensity, and anxiety) pre- and post-training (immediate outcomes), and throughout a four-week period (longer-term outcomes). The main outcomes analyses compared the intervention and control groups, with secondary sub-analyses among participants who listened to at least 2/3 of their recordings (10 minutes), and among those who experienced a clinically meaningful (20%) reduction in pain. RESULTS: Mindful Jazz and Mindful Music (Intervention) participants reported significantly less pain intensity (p < 0.001) and pain unpleasantness (p < 0.001) immediately after the training relative to the Jazz Education and Music Education (Control) participants. Mindful Jazz participants also reported a significant reduction in anxiety compared to the Jazz and Music Education groups (p < 0.05). Throughout the four-week period, Mindful Jazz participants reported less pain intensity relative to both control groups (Jazz and Music Education); Mindful Music participants reported significantly less pain intensity relative to only the Jazz Education participants. Mindful Jazz participants reported a >20% decrease in pain intensity more frequently than Jazz Education (Χ2=48.71, p<0.001), Music Education (Χ2=65.13, p<0.001), and Mindful Music (Χ2=8.74, p=0.003) participants. Similarly, among the instances when a participant listened to at least 10 minutes of their audio recording, the proportion who achieved a >20% decrease in pain intensity differed significantly ((Χ2=84.03, p<0.001): Jazz Education, 29%; Music Education, 26%, Mindful Jazz, 50%; Mindful Music 41%). CONCLUSION: Mindfully listening to music can help to reduce pain-related outcomes. Both music education (i.e., music listening without mindfulness training) and mindfully listening to music (i.e., listening with mindfulness training) helped to decrease pain and anxiety from baseline to follow-up. However, mindful listening reduced pain to a greater amount compared to music education, suggesting that mindfully listening to music is a more impactful pain reduction intervention compared to listening without mindfulness training. Future research is warranted with a larger sample."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adequate pain management continues to be an unmet need in patients with cancer. Pain is known to impact the quality of life. It is recommended that treatment plans include pharmacological and complementary non-pharmacological methods for managing pain. Music listening therapy is an evidence-based intervention used to manage acute and chronic pain in adult patients with cancer. METHODS: This evidence-based practice project applied the use of music therapy in adult patients with cancer experiencing moderate to severe pain despite current pharmacological treatment in a rural outpatient oncology clinic. Pre- and post-intervention pain scores were assessed using a numeric rating scale, and results were analyzed using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: The results showed 83% of participants reported a reduction in pain intensity by at least one pain level after using music listening therapy. Additionally, 100% of participants expressed a willingness to continue music listening therapy at home as a self-guided technique to reduce pain severity. CONCLUSION: The role of the advanced practice provider must include comprehensive pain management and pain monitoring to assess its impact on patient quality of life. Patients are more willing to perform complementary interventions that have minimal barriers to physical, economic, and environmental factors, particularly in rural settings where the lack of additional health resources is significant. Music listening therapy may be conducted in any environment with known positive impacts on acute and chronic pain. Therefore, music listening therapy is a viable non-pharmacological complementary intervention that should be included in the education provided to our patients in their fight against cancer."

Participants completed a treadmill walking task under three different conditions (motivational music, motivational video, and no intervention). We measured their step width and step length and their hip, knee, and ankle joint angles at heel strike and toe-off. Results showed a significant positive effect of the music condition on step width and stride length and hip joint angle at heel strike, and ankle joint angle at toe-off. There was a significant effect of group (cognitive style) on step width, the angle of the hip joint and the angle of the knee joint at toe-off; however, there was no significant group by condition interaction for any of the assessed variables. Thus, walking with motivational music improved gait parameters in older adults."

      "abstract": "Neurological disorders represent a significant challenge for healthcare systems, necessitating innovative and multidisciplinary therapeutic approaches. These disorders often lead to difficulties in various aspects of daily life, including physical functioning, mental health, and quality of life (QoL). Telecoaching (TC) and Music Therapy (MT) are two emerging modalities that may provide valuable support for individuals with these conditions. This narrative review aims to analyse recent studies investigating the efficacy of TC and MT in this population. A total of 23 studies were included in this narrative review. These studies indicate that TC positively affects physical functioning and adherence to intervention programs, with participants reporting improvements in gait and balance, as well as a reduction in postural instability and fall rates. Similarly, MT has shown promising outcomes in decreasing anxiety and sleep disorders while enhancing cognitive and emotional well-being. Integrating TC and MT into treatment approaches offers a promising alternative for improving QoL and overall well-being. However, further research is needed to consolidate the evidence and optimize the implementation of these interventions in clinical practice. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies and comparative evaluations to further clarify the role of TC and MT in the treatment of neurological disorders, as well as their long-term effects."

      "abstract": "The early childhood education and care (ECEC) environment is an important setting for providing children with daily opportunities for movement and music, supporting holistic child development in the early years. To date, there are no studies evaluating the implementation of a holistic programme in the ECEC context in the areas of movement behaviour and motor and musical skills. The main aim is to examine the effectiveness of a holistic movement and music programme on physical activity (PA), sedentary behaviour and sleep, motor skills and musical skills in young children (1-3 years). The secondary aims are to examine the impact of the movement and music programme on the perceptions of the educational community, as well as the barriers and facilitators they perceive in the process of baseline assessment, construction, and implementation of the movement and music programme in their own ECEC community. This cluster-randomised controlled trial (intervention and control groups) with public ECEC centres will be performed over a 24-month period. Baseline measurements will be taken in the first year of the project, and assessments to examine the effectiveness of the programme will take place 12 months after the baseline assessment. For young children the main outcome variables will be: (a) PA, sedentary time, and sleep time; (b) gross and fine motor skills; and (c) musical skills. The secondary outcomes will be: (a) PA and sedentary time during outdoor play and structured PA sessions; (b) play patterns during outdoor free play; and (c) movement and music behaviours after ECEC hours. For families, secondary outcomes will be: (a) perceived barriers and facilitators to PA in young children; (b) perceived barriers and facilitators to the inclusion of music at home; and (c) the means of transport to ECEC settings and barriers to active commuting. For ECEC educators, the secondary will be: (a) perceived barriers and facilitators for the inclusion of movement and music as curricular practices in the ECEC institution; (b) perceived impact of the implementation of the movement and music programme. This research project aims to fill a knowledge gap during a period of childhood that has rarely been explored, either nationally or internationally (1-3 years), and to position movement and music teaching practices as key contexts in the curriculum development of infant and toddler education."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Music therapy (MT) is a recognized modality for pain and anxiety reduction. Although its efficacy has been demonstrated in various clinical settings, its application in emergency departments (ED) remains controversial. This study aims to study the effects of MT in reducing pain and anxiety among patients visiting the ED with pain complaints. METHODS: A single-center, randomized controlled trial was conducted at Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok, from July 2023 to September 2024. During each month of the study period, three days were randomly selected for the MT group, and another three days were designated for the non-MT group. All participants received standard analgesia and completed pre- and post-session questionnaires to assess pain, anxiety, satisfaction, and ED service quality before and one hour after analgesia. The MT group received MT sessions, each lasting 30-40 min. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients participated (31 MT group, 32 control group). The MT group showed a significant reduction in pain scores of 1.52 points compared to 0.09 in the non-MT group (p 0.002). Anxiety score was also significantly reduced in the MT group by 1.87 points compared to 0.44 points in the non-MT group (p 0.026). The most significant improvements were observed in non-trauma-related pain and anxiety. Satisfaction scores increased in both groups (0.48 vs. 0.47 points; p 0.946), with no significant difference. However, MT significantly improved perceived ED service quality (0.98 vs. 0.10 points; p 0.001). CONCLUSION: In this study, we found that music therapy, when combined with standard analgesia, effectively reduced pain and anxiety in patients presenting to the ED, particularly those with non-trauma-related pain.

      "abstract": "Postpartum depression (PPD) significantly impacts women's mental health and social functioning, yet effective therapies remain limited. This study investigates the preventive effects of music therapy on PPD-like behaviors and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms in a mouse model subjected to ovarian hormone withdrawal (HW). Mice exposed to daily music sessions exhibited markedly reduced depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, as evidenced by enhanced performance in behavioral tests such as the open field test (OFT), forced swim test (FST), elevated plus maze test (EPM), sucrose preference test (SPT), novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) test, and tail suspension test (TST). Furthermore, music therapy normalized oxidative stress indicators (NO, MDA, SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, T-AOC, ATP, and glutamate) in the serum, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. Additionally, music exposure reduced levels of proinflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-1β, iNOS, TNF-α, and TGF-β) and the activation of microglia and astrocytes in these brain regions. Notably, music therapy preserved neuronal integrity, promoted neurogenesis, and maintained synaptic plasticity, evidenced by the restoration of dendritic spines. Transcriptome sequencing identified differential gene expression in pathways related to synaptic plasticity, inflammation, and oxidative stress. These findings suggest that music therapy prevents PPD by modulating oxidative stress, inflammation, and synaptic integrity, providing robust preclinical evidence for its potential as a natural preventive intervention for PPD. This study underscores the need for further clinical research to validate the therapeutic efficacy of music in preventing PPD in humans, highlighting its promise as a non-invasive and accessible treatment modality.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is an effective treatment for various hematologic cancers, though it often results in severe side effects and psychological distress, which can negatively impact health outcomes. Integrative therapies like mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), mindfulness meditation (MM), and music therapy (MT) yield promising results in enhancing both psychosocial outcomes (eg, reducing anxiety and depression) and physiological adaptation (eg, decreasing inflammation) in cancer patients. OBJECTIVE: We developed and refined, using focus groups and environmental and field testing, an eHealth-delivered mindfulness-based music therapy (eMBMT) intervention aimed at improving health-related quality of life, symptom burden (ie, pain, fatigue, and sleep), disease activity (ie, chronic graft-versus-host disease, cytomegalovirus activation, and infections) and psychosocial (ie, depression, anxiety, and cancer-specific distress) and physiological adaptation (ie, inflammation and immune reconstitution) tailored to adults receiving allo-SCT. METHODS: eMBMT intervention content is grounded in MT, MM, and MBSR, developed by a multidisciplinary team, and adapted for adults undergoing allo-SCT. eMBMT content was refined through focus groups and usability and field testing. Focus groups used a semistructured interview guide, while field testing used the \"think aloud\" method. Usability was evaluated using the 30-item Usefulness, Satisfaction, and Ease of Use (USE) questionnaire. Descriptive statistics analyzed the USE questionnaire and participant characteristics, while rapid qualitative analysis was applied to focus groups and field-testing sessions. Survivors eligible to participate in the focus groups and usability and field testing were adults (>18 years old) who received an allo-SCT (<36 months) for myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, or chronic myeloid leukemia, and were in remission for greater than 3 months. RESULTS: During the focus groups, participants (n=11; mean age 43.6, SD 17.8 years) provided qualitative feedback highlighting the shock of diagnosis, challenges during hospitalization, and coping strategies posttreatment. The eMBMT platform received positive evaluations for usefulness (mean 6.47, SD 0.29), ease of use (mean 6.92, SD 0.60), and satisfaction (mean 6.16, SD 0.82). Key themes from field testing highlighted the significance of social support, hope, and maintaining an active lifestyle. Suggestions for improvement included incorporating more representative content, reducing text, enhancing guidance, offering diverse music options, and streamlining blood sample collection. CONCLUSIONS: The eMBMT intervention is a comprehensive, user-friendly eHealth tool tailored to the unique needs of allo-SCT patients. The positive feedback and identified areas for improvement underscore its potential to enhance well-being, symptom management, and overall quality of life for cancer survivors. A future pilot randomized controlled trial will further evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the eMBMT intervention in improving health-related quality of life, symptom burden, disease activity, and psychosocial and physiological adaptation.",

However, research on participatory music-based perinatal interventions is limited and typically focused on postnatal depression. This study explores the various elements of four music-based interventions supporting different severities of perinatal mental health needs. METHODS: Five musician leads and two clinicians were interviewed from four music-based perinatal interventions. Interviews explored the key features, goals, impacts and challenges of each intervention. RESULTS: A reflexive thematic analysis identified four themes: (1) Incorporating varied musical activities; (2) Fostering a supportive community; (3) Affecting psycho-emotional change; and (4) Strategies for accessibility. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the multiple mechanisms through which participatory music interventions can promote perinatal mental health, including emotional regulation, self-compassion and coping skills. These findings can be used to guide future interventions for a wider spectrum of severities and types of perinatal mental health."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postnatal mothers can experience anxiety, stress and difficulty with mother-infant attachment with potential to lead to an anxiety disorder/depression. There has been an increase in interest in non-pharmacological interventions involving music, with limited evidence assessing effectiveness in this population within randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Mamas in Harmony is a novel music/social support intervention. The objective is to assess the feasibility/acceptability of conducting a full RCT to test the effect and cost-effectiveness of Mamas in Harmony compared with usual care. METHODS: The pilot RCT aims to recruit 60 mother-infant dyads through social media, community organisations and stakeholder networks, randomly allocated on a 2:1 ratio to the intervention and control group. The intervention group will receive eight 1 h weekly Mamas in Harmony sessions plus usual care, and the control group will receive usual care only. Feasibility measures include recruitment, retention and attendance at intervention sessions. The process evaluation aims to establish acceptability of the intervention involving survey evaluation and semi-structured interviews. A priori guidelines have been agreed to establish criteria for progression to a definitive RCT. DISCUSSION: The current evidence supports the use of music in reducing anxiety and stress with the recommendation for inclusion of social support. This study has potential to provide robust evidence of the feasibility and acceptability of a music and social support mother-infant group intervention in preparation for a future definitive trial, should progression criteria be met. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT05930990 , registered retrospectively on 5 July 2023. Recruitment commenced on 16 March 2023. PROTOCOL VERSION: 30 October 2023 Vn 1.0."

To address this issue, we tested the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of an ecological momentary music intervention for stress reduction in everyday life in Turkish immigrant women perceiving chronic ethnic discrimination. Following an intra-individual randomized design, we combined subjective assessments and biological measures (salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase). Using a smartphone-based app, twenty participants responded to stress- and discrimination-related items four times a day for 35 days, and additionally reported each stressful/discriminatory event they perceived. Participants were then randomly instructed to listen to music or not. At each measurement time point, participants provided saliva samples. The feasibility of the ecological momentary music intervention was indicated by high usage rates of the app and participants' positive self-reports. We found immediate (post 1: b =  - 14.64, p = .045, post 2: b =  - 14.62, p = .047) and intermediate (b =  - 0.81, p < .001) effects of music listening on subjective stress levels but not on biological stress levels.

AIM: This systematic review aims to synthesize existing evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating neuroimaging-based structural and functional neuroplasticity following music- and dance-based interventions among people with neurological disorders. METHODS: Literature research was performed using PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, and Web of Science (WOS). A multidimensional approach was employed to assess the efficacy of music- and dance-based interventions, integrating neuroimaging and clinical assessments. RESULTS: Out of a total of 2247 papers reviewed, 20 RCTs met the inclusion criteria for this review, with a total of 718 subjects. Among them, 88% underwent a neuroimaging investigation to evaluate structural or functional neuroplasticity. Six studies involved dance-based interventions, while 14 examined music-based rehabilitation. These interventions targeted cognitive, motor, and mood impairments in people at risk of dementia or with neurological disorders including Huntington's Disease, stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and disorder of consciousness. DISCUSSION: Overall, the selected studies demonstrated significant effects on behavioral and neuroimaging outcomes, showing structural and functional changes in critical areas for perception and memory in patients at risk of dementia, as well as in regions essential for language processing, emotional regulation, and motor control in patients with acute and chronic stroke. Nevertheless, several biases were identified, specifically related to neuroimaging biomarkers, such as a lack of baseline and between-group comparisons and a lack of prior registration of neuroimaging biomarkers investigated. The protocol of this review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), with registration number CRD42024574754.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate whether music therapy, as a nonpharmacological intervention, effectively reduces preoperative anxiety in children undergoing anesthesia. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Studies examining the impact of music therapy on preoperative anxiety in pediatric patients were systematically identified, screened, and selected for inclusion. Data from eligible studies were synthesized using a random-effects model to assess the pooled effect size, with sensitivity analyses performed to verify result stability. Publication bias across the included studies was also investigated to ensure reliability of the findings. FINDINGS: The analysis included 7 studies comprising a total of 440 pediatric participants. Findings indicated that music therapy led to a statistically significant reduction in anxiety levels, yielding a moderate effect size (standardized mean difference = -0.48; 95% confidence interval, -0.81 to -0.15; I2 = 65.6%). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated consistent results, as the removal of individual studies did not significantly alter the overall effect estimate. Additionally, no substantial publication bias was detected, supporting the validity of the meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The findings strongly endorse music therapy as an effective nonpharmacological strategy for managing preoperative anxiety in pediatric patients undergoing anesthesia. With a statistically significant moderate reduction in anxiety observed, music therapy emerges as a valuable tool for improving the perioperative experience and potentially enhancing recovery outcomes in pediatric surgical care."

      "abstract": "Phenotypic investigations have shown that actively engaging with music, i.e., playing a musical instrument or singing may be protective of motor decline in aging. For example, music training associated with enhanced sensorimotor skills accompanied by changes in brain structure and function. Although it is possible that the benefits of active music engagement \"transfer\" to benefits in the motor domain, it is also possible that the genetic architecture of motor behaviour and the motor system structure may influence active music engagement. This study investigated whether polygenic scores (PGS) for five behavioural motor traits, 12 neuromotor structural brain traits, and seven rates of change in brain structure traits trained from existing discovery genome-wide association studies (GWAS) predict active music engagement outcomes in four independent cohorts of unrelated individuals of European ancestry: the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA; N=22,198), Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS; N=4,605), Vanderbilt's BioVU Repository (BioVU; N=6,150), and Vanderbilt's Online Musicality study (OM; N=1,559). Results were meta-analyzed for each PGS main effect across outcomes and cohorts, revealing that PGS for a faster walking pace was associated with higher amounts of active music engagement. Within CLSA, a higher PGS for walking pace was associated with greater odds of engaging with music. Findings suggest a shared genetic architecture between motor function and active music engagement. Future intervention-based research should consider the genetic underpinnings of motor behavior when evaluating the effects of music engagement on motor function across the lifespan."

Despite national guidelines recommending bereavement care, resources for bereaved parents are scarce. Most intervention studies lack empirical evidence of effectiveness or alignment with key theoretical concepts. AIMS: To evaluate the feasibility of a 6-week intervention with parents of children who have died from cancer. Storytelling Through Music (STM) combines multiple modalities of expression (storytelling, reflective writing, songwriting) and psychoeducation to facilitate loss- and restoration-oriented coping by creating a legacy piece (self-written story paired with a song) to help bereaved parents adapt to a life-long process of finding meaning after loss. METHODS: Two-group, randomized controlled trial, utilizing multiple methods. Participants were randomized to STM or waitlist control. The intervention is delivered online and in a group setting. Descriptive statistics were used for feasibility data, content analysis to evaluate open-ended acceptability questions, and RM ANOVA to evaluate the differences between psychosocial, coping, and grief outcomes. RESULTS: Twenty-three parents were enrolled. Average age was (range: 32-68) and the child's average age was 18.9 (range: 1.5-35). This study indicates that the online delivery of STM is feasible and acceptable and provides preliminary evidence of reducing prolonged grief and loneliness. CONCLUSIONS: STM is a theoretically driven, innovative approach to addressing grief in a high-risk, underserved population. Findings suggest STM can be delivered online and is acceptable to participants. Adding music to storytelling and reflective writing provides a unique expression and preliminary data suggests improvements in psychosocial well-being, coping, and grief intensity.",

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to consolidate and synthesize findings on the available evidence of music-based interventions and maternal mental health among women with healthy term infants in the postpartum period. SEARCH STRATEGY: This is a mixed-studies systematic review. The search strategy included PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Google Scholar, and ProQuest Dissertations from inception to April 2022. SELECTION CRITERIA: Women with healthy-term infants were included. Phenomena of interest include the experiences of music-based intervention that can be classified into two categories: Active intervention (e.g., creating music, playing an instrument, singing, or musical improvisation), or receptive intervention (e.g., listening to music). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Thematic synthesis was conducted. Studies were appraised using the mixed method appraisal tool. MAIN RESULTS: Eleven articles were included. Thematic synthesis identified an overarching theme as \"Music-a lifeline to better maternal mental health.\" This was pillared by three themes: (1) Psycho-social impact of music-based interventions, (2) influences of music on mother-infant relationships, and (3) the way forward for music-based interventions. Music-based interventions have mixed influences on symptoms of depression, stress, and anxiety. However, they can alleviate maternal mood, increase the sense of accomplishment, and strengthen mother-infant attachment. This is especially so for group-based and active music-making interventions. Future studies should include the theoretical rationale for choosing the type and mode of music-based interventions. Future research with standardized intervention, population, outcome measures, mode, and place of intervention delivery is needed to ascertain the effects of music-based interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, music-based intervention can be an accessible and convenient way to strengthen mother-infant bonding, maternal mood, and sense of accomplishment among women with healthy-term infants."

The feasibility of the EMMI-T was confirmed in a pilot study (n=20). Here, we present the protocol of our proposed study to investigate the effectiveness of the EMMI-T. METHODS: Fifty Turkish immigrant women perceiving chronic ED will take part in the 35-day study. During all three study periods (ie, baseline, intervention and post-intervention), participants will use a smartphone-based app to provide discrimination-related and stress-related data four times a day. Additionally, they will report every discriminatory and/or stressful event. During the intervention period, subsequently after such event-based data entries, participants will be allocated to either an intervention event (music listening for 10 or 20 min) or a control event (no music listening). Irrespective of event type, the app will signal 20 min after the initial event-based data entry for additional data collection. Every data entry will be accompanied by the collection of a saliva sample for analysis of biological stress markers (alpha-amylase, cortisol). ANALYSIS: This intraindividual randomised design will allow us to test immediate (ie, before vs after music listening) and intermediate (ie, baseline period vs postintervention period) effects of the EMMI-T on psychological and biological stress levels. To test our hypotheses, we will use multilevel modelling. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Positive ethical approval was given by the institutional review board of the University of Vienna (reference number 00575). The results of our study will be disseminated at conferences and submitted to a peer-reviewed journal. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05829031.",

Music-based intervention is a nonpharmacological treatment that is used to treat depression and anxiety and that has very few side effects. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of Chinese 5-element music-based intervention (CFEMBI) based on the midnight-noon ebb-flow theory on depression and anxiety among older adults. METHODS: A total of 86 patients were divided into the control and experimental groups. The control group underwent a traditional CFEMBI, and the experimental group underwent a CFEMBI based on the midnight-noon ebb-flow theory. Outcomes were assessed at the 4th week, 8th week, and 12th week during the intervention. RESULTS: After the 12th week, there was a significant difference in scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) between the control and experimental groups (Z = -6.375, P value < 0.001). Additionally, there was a significant difference in the cure rate of depression between the 2 groups at week 12 (P < .001). After the 8th week, there was a significant difference in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) scores between the 2 groups (t = 7.422, P value < 0.001). Furthermore, there was a significant difference in scores on the Quality of Life, Enjoyment, and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF) between the 2 groups (Z = 4.991, P value < 0.001; Z = 3.023, P value < 0.01; Z = 3.023, P value < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: CFEMBI based on the midnight-noon ebb-flow theory is effective at alleviating depression and anxiety in older adults and improving life satisfaction.",

This study aimed to understand the experiences, perceptions, and emotions of chronically ill hospitalized patients who participated in a program of individual micro-concerts during their hospital stay. METHODOLOGY: A qualitative study was conducted in a hospital in Bilbao, Spain, in 2024. Hospitalized patients were offered 20-minute micro-concerts three times a week. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 patients selected through purposive sampling. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed inductively to identify thematic patterns. RESULTS: The analysis identified four categories. The first was emotional and cognitive well-being, where patients reported improvements in mood and cognitive stimulation. The second category, the operational aspects of the intervention, highlighted the positive perception of the frequency, duration, and personalization of the sessions. The third category was personal evaluation, where the role of the music therapist was highlighted as a key factor in the success of the intervention. Finally, suggestions for improvement included recommendations to extend the program to other areas of the hospital and combine musical interventions with complementary activities. CONCLUSIONS: Personalized musical interventions have a positive impact on the emotional and cognitive well-being of patients. It is essential to design flexible interventions that adapt to individual needs and promote integrated care models."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Sudden road conditions can trigger drivers' psychological stress, increasing the risk of traffic accidents. Music, as an emotion regulation tool, effectively alleviates stress and enhances psychological health. However, the effects of different genres of music on drivers' stress remain understudied. METHODS: To address this, the present study collected 120 EEG recordings from 60 drivers in a standardized simulated driving environment and developed a classification model based on EEG signals to recognize emotions. By integrating time-frequency domain features (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, and power spectral density) with classification algorithms, the model accurately identified slight, moderate, and severe stress states in drivers, achieving an accuracy of 90%. RESULTS: Furthermore, the study evaluated the intervention effects of four types of music (joyful, sorrowful, exhilarating, and gentle) on stress using EEG signals and subjective stress ratings. The results showed that gentle music had the best stress-relieving effect in both slight and severe stress states, reducing stress by 41.67% and 45%, respectively, whereas joyful music was most effective in relieving moderate stress, reducing moderate stress by 50%. In contrast, exhilarating and sorrowful music had weaker effects. Additionally, the asymmetry of frontal pole EEG signals was found to be significantly negatively correlated with stress levels. DISCUSSION: This finding further supports the accuracy of the emotion recognition model and the potential effectiveness of the music intervention strategy. The study demonstrates that personalized music intervention strategies can help alleviate drivers' stress, thereby improving psychological health, enhancing driving safety, and increasing driving comfort."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cancer is currently the second most common cause of death worldwide and is often treated with chemotherapy. Music therapy is a widely used adjunct therapy offered in oncology settings to attenuate negative impacts of treatment on patient's physical and mental health; however, music therapy research during chemotherapy is relatively scarce. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of group music therapy sessions with patients and caregivers on their perceived anxiety, stress, and wellbeing levels and the perception of chemotherapy-induced side effects for patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study following the STROBE guidelines. From April to October 2022, 41 group music therapy sessions including 141 patients and 51 caregivers were conducted. Participants filled out pre- and post-intervention Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) assessing their anxiety, stress, and wellbeing levels, and for patients the intensity of chemotherapy-induced side effects. RESULTS: The results show a statistically significant decrease of anxiety and stress levels (p < .001), an increase in well-being of patients and caregivers (p < .001, p = .009), and a decrease in patients' perceived intensity of chemotherapy-induced side effects (p = .003). Calculated effect sizes were moderate for anxiety, stress, and well-being levels, and small for chemotherapy-induced side effects. DISCUSSION: This is the first study regarding group music therapy sessions for cancer patients and their caregivers during chemotherapy in Colombia. Music therapy has been found to be a valuable strategy to reduce psychological distress in this population and to provide opportunities for fostering self-care and social interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Music therapy should be considered as a valuable complementary therapy during chemotherapy. However, it is crucial to conduct prospective studies with parallel group designs to confirm these preliminary findings.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Evidence on the impact of music-making interventions on brain plasticity in older adults is limited. AIMS: To investigate whether music-making interventions in older adults induce neurobiological changes and if such changes relate to cognitive improvements. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in Medline, PsycINFO, and Scopus. Inclusion criteria targeted randomised controlled trials with older adults (with and without mild cognitive impairment [MCI]), music-making interventions as exposure, and neurobiological measures as the primary outcome. RESULTS: Six studies (555 cognitively intact older adults) met inclusion criteria-five used piano training, one used choral singing. Three studies had overlapping cohorts, and four had a high risk of bias. One study employed electroencephalography (EEG) to measure frontal and parietal activity, while five used structural MRI to assess cortical, subcortical, and white matter integrity. Methodological heterogeneity limited comparability. Findings in the piano group included increased frontal theta power during an improvisation task, greater grey matter volume in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and cerebellum, slower fibre density decline in the fornix and preserved grey matter volume in the right auditory cortex and hippocampus. Only one study reported a positive correlation between neurobiological changes and executive functioning improvements. No studies assessed neurobiological outcomes in MCI. DISCUSSION: Evidence on music-making interventions and neuroplasticity in older adults remains inconclusive due to limited studies, high risk of bias, and methodological variability. While preliminary findings suggest potential neurobiological changes with music-making interventions, there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: High-quality trials are needed to clarify the neurobiological impact of music-making, particularly in MCI populations.",

Additionally, there is no standardized use of personalized music listening and group music activities. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the current use of music in long-term care communities, to identify trends and patterns of music use and record the observed benefits that music use provides. METHODS: This study utilized a qualitative research approach using semi-structured interviews with care community staff and care community observations to examine the role that music played as a therapeutic tool for individuals with AD/ADRD living in care communities. RESULTS: Five different communities were visited and observed. Of the five communities visited, interviews were conducted at four communities. One community did not participate in the interviews due to scheduling conflicts. Two staff members were interviewed at each participating community resulting in eight total interviews. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this qualitative survey of care communities suggests that staff members believe that music use has beneficial effects for residents living with AD/ADRD. Music is economical, easily accessible, and very adaptable. Music can be used in a broad range of situations to improve the quality of life for both residents and staff in care communities. Music use can be active or passive, it can be used by an individual or a group to excite and engage or to calm and soothe."

      "abstract": "Music medicine holds transformative potential for enhancing patient care, yet its widespread impact remains limited due to several barriers. While music has demonstrated benefits to human health, its integration into healthcare settings has been constrained by its predominance of Euro-centric classical genres and a narrow pool of providers. To unlock music medicine's full potential, a broader approach is necessary. This includes diversifying musical genres to include a range of cultural preferences, expanding the role of certified music therapists, leveraging technology for remote interventions, and establishing new reimbursement pathways. However, current practices often perpetuate health disparities by limiting access to affluent settings, skewing evidence, and excluding marginalized communities. To address these issues, we advocate for a reconceptualization of music interventions that prioritizes equity, inclusivity, and cultural relevance. Expanding research, integrating diverse musical offerings, and adopting online platforms can enhance accessibility and effectiveness, bridging gaps in care and improving patient outcomes. By embracing these changes, music medicine can evolve into a comprehensive, equitable tool for holistic health promotion."

Studies showed that music therapy benefits preterm infants and their parents. We aimed to explore the possible influence of music therapy on physiological parameters in premature infants during skin-to-skin care and to assess the parents' perspectives on music therapy and participation in the research project. Methods: The feasibility project was conducted in an Austrian neonatal intensive care unit with a mixed-methods design. The subjects were six preterm infants and their parents. We collected quantitative data on heart rate, oxygen saturation, and brain activity (EEG) and analyzed them descriptively. Qualitative interviews were conducted to explore the parents' perspectives on music therapy and study participation and analyzed by using grounded theory coding. Results: The results of the quantitative data indicated a stabilizing effect on the vital parameters in the included premature infants. EEGs showed interburst intervals were longer during music therapy than before its application. Parents reported a great interest in the research project, an experience of deep relaxation through music therapy, and an intensification of their relationship with their infants. Discussion/Conclusions: Our feasibility sample indicates positive changes in the vital parameters and brain activity tendencies. The parents reported positive experiences and observations in their infants related to music therapy, and they enjoyed participating in the research project. However, the small number of subjects means that our descriptions should be interpreted cautiously, and more extensive investigations into EEG measurements in preterm infants are needed."

      "abstract": "Groove, a complex aspect of music perception, plays a crucial role in eliciting emotional and physical responses from listeners. However, accurately quantifying and predicting groove remains challenging due to its intricate acoustic features. To address this, we propose a novel framework for groove rating that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), enhanced by entropy regularization and entropy-pooling techniques. Our approach processes audio files into Mel-spectrograms, which are analyzed by a CNN for feature extraction and by a TCN to capture long-range temporal dependencies, enabling precise groove-level prediction. Experimental results show that our CNN-TCN framework significantly outperforms benchmark methods in predictive accuracy. The integration of entropy pooling and regularization is critical, with their omission leading to notable reductions in R2 values. Our method also surpasses the performance of CNN and other machine-learning models, including long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and support vector machine (SVM) variants. This study establishes a strong foundation for the automated assessment of musical groove, with potential applications in music education, therapy, and composition. Future research will focus on expanding the dataset, enhancing model generalization, and exploring additional machine-learning techniques to further elucidate the factors influencing groove perception."

METHODS: The randomized participants listened to either a 30-min music playlist or a book-reading audio script twice weekly for six weeks, and when agitation occurred. Their agitation level was observed every 5 min from the beginning of an agitation episode for an hour to monitor its trajectory over a 2-week period. Multilevel models with maximum likelihood analysis was conducted. The frequency of agitation and other behavioural symptoms was assessed at baseline and the 6th week and analysed with Generalized Estimating Equations. RESULTS: Twenty-four participants were recruited, and 10 presented 36 agitation episodes during the first two weeks of observation. The recruitment and retention rates were 85.7% and 83.3%, respectively. A total of 97.2% of the intervention and control conditions were delivered as planned. The intervention was not more effective than the control condition in de-escalating agitation or reducing agitation and other behavioural symptoms. Overall, agitation symptoms were apparently alleviated in the first 10 min, with a decelerated pace observed thereafter.

Because people getting venipunctures in medical and surgical settings usually feel pain and anxiety, the goal of this study was to look at and compare how cryotherapy (CT) and music therapy (MT) affected the levels of pain and anxiety (P&Amp;A) these people felt. METHOD: This research utilized a randomized controlled trial methodology. The target population consisted of patients hospitalized in the medical-surgical wards of Valiasr Hospital, Arak, Iran. One hundred twenty patients were purposively selected and then randomly assigned (using block randomization) to one of four groups: MT, CT, combination therapy (COBT), or control. P&Amp;A levels were assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Visual Anxiety Intensity Scale (VAIS). Data were analyzed utilizing version 21 of the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software. Descriptive statistics, including mean, standard deviation, frequency, and percentage, along with inferential statistics, such as the analysis of variance test, paired t-test, and Chi-square, were employed for analysis. FINDINGS: The findings revealed a statistically significant disparity in pain levels among the four groups (P<0.001). The mean pain score in the COBT group (1.66±1.66) was lower than that of the MT group (2.03±1.84) and the CT group (2.43±2.16). However, the three intervention groups (MT, CT, and COBT) showed no notable difference from a statistical perspective (P>0.05). Additionally, a statistically substantial distinction in anxiety levels was observed among the four groups after the study (P<0.05). Both the COBT and MT therapies markedly diminished anxiety severity in comparison to the control group. CONCLUSION: The study results demonstrated that MT, CT, and COBT are effective in alleviating P&Amp;A in patients having venipuncture procedures. These interventions may serve as valuable complementary or alternative approaches in clinical practice."

While no significant cognitive improvements were observed on the Bayley-III scale, positive effects were noted in language, motor skills, and IQ scores when assessed via Gesell, CSBQ, and IQ scales. Our research underscores the potential of music intervention in the process of children's neurodevelopment, including cognitive function, language, motor and IQ. Based on the limitations, researchers should carefully design their MI protocols, ensuring standardization and avoiding probable confounding factors such as regional specificity, age ranges and special populations, it will contribute to more robust results and improve the comparability of findings across studies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many people with mild intellectual disabilities are at increased risk to experience stress. Reducing stress is important because experiencing prolonged and elevated stress can have detrimental effects on mental and physical health and it is associated with aggressive behaviour and self-harm. AIMS: This preliminary study investigated whether an intervention combining biofeedback with listening to music is effective and whether a personalized music playlist is more effective than self-selected music in reducing physiological and subjective stress in participants with mild intellectual disabilities. METHODS: We collected 103 music listening sessions over a period of 2-4 weeks for 11 participants throughout their daily routines. They listened to music when they received biofeedback on their increased stress level (as measured by wearable biosensor Nowatch) or when they themselves felt stressed. Participants listened either to self-selected music or to a personalised playlist compiled with X-system, music technology that predicts the effect of a song on levels of autonomic arousal. Pulse rate (PR) and skin conductance level (SCL) were measured with the EmbracePlus and subjective feelings of stress and mood were measured with two scale questions. After the intervention phase, participants and their caregivers completed a short questionnaire to evaluate their experiences with using the X-system playlist. RESULTS: Mixed regression analyses showed reductions in PR and SCL during listening to music, and indications were found for reductions in subjective stress and improvement of mood after intervention. Listening to music compiled with X-system was not more effective than listening to self-selected music. However, lower combined arousal values (a feature of X-system) from self-selected and X-system music predicted lower PR and SCL, indicating that these indices can be used to select songs that have a relaxing or energizing effect. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The present study suggests that music listening is associated with both subjective and physiological stress reduction. Listening to music might be an accessible, inexpensive and empowering strategy for stress reduction and improving emotion regulation, which could also benefit mental and physical health. Several challenges were encountered while implementing the intervention and suggestions for future research are given."

      "abstract": "Prosociality is essential in human interactions, characterized by voluntary behaviors aimed at benefiting others. Promoting such behaviors is indispensable for human relationships. Studies have demonstrated positive effects of interpersonal synchrony interventions through musical sessions. Some authors suggest that the joint creation of music facilitates prosocial behaviors (PB). This review aims to determine whether evidence supports the idea that participation in a musical interpersonal synchrony experience improves PB. A systematic review of 12 selected articles was conducted. The search was carried out in databases such as WoS, Scopus, PubMed, Dialnet, Elsevier, and Eric. Results indicate that music, as a tool, creates an optimal environment for mimesis and group participation, which can enhance prosociality. Controlling variables such as sample size, population type, measurement instruments, techniques, and session design is necessary for future research. It is concluded that interpersonal synchrony through music appears to improve prosociality, although more robust studies are required."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As disasters intensify and professional deficits persist, civil protection is reliant on medical volunteers. With limited physician availability, telemedicine is promising. No system currently empowers lower-qualified paramedics for physician-delegated telemedicine. Existing telemedicine technology unfits for civil protection. This study aimed to evaluate a modified system at a music festival to simulate disaster situations. METHODS: A tablet-based telemedicine system, integrating vital sign monitoring, was deployed at the \"Summerjam\" music festival characterized by various medical emergencies. A physician could be contacted via telemedicine or requested onsite. Medical feasibility was rated by patient condition changes, with National Advisory Committee of Aeronautics (NACA) score and Primary Ranking for Initial Orientation in the Rescue service (PRIOR) algorithm for triaging. Technical feasibility was assessed by connection stability, communication, and vital sign transmission. RESULTS: Of 404 treatments, 34 (8.4%) were performed using telemedicine, 49 (12.1%) were carried out with a physician onsite. Telemedicine treatments accounted for 40.9% of all treatment in which a physician was involved. Patient conditions varied up to NACA III (moderate disturbance). A variety of internal medical (76.5%) and surgical (23.5%) conditions were addressed, some of which required invasive measures or application of medication. No patients experienced a deterioration in their condition. Despite technical difficulties, treatment was not significantly impacted, confirming technical feasibility. CONCLUSION: The study shows that lower-qualified paramedics can effectively use telemedicine for physician-delegated treatment, suggesting potential applicability to civil protection. Nonetheless, further system robustness improvements and research are needed."

      "abstract": "A single bout of exercise transiently \"boosts\" executive function (EF) and is a benefit that may be linked to an increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF). In turn, some work has reported that music listening imparts a similar EF benefit and increases CBF. In the present work, we examined whether music listening provides an EF benefit comparable to aerobic exercise and whether combined music listening and aerobic exercise supports an additive benefit. To that end, healthy young adults (N = 22, 14 female, 19-28 years) completed 10-min single bouts of: (1) music listening (ML), (2) light intensity aerobic exercise (AE), (3) combined ML and AE (ML + AE), and (4) a non-AE and non-ML control condition. For all conditions, pre- and post-intervention EF was assessed via the antisaccade task (i.e., saccade mirror-symmetrical to a target) and transcranial Doppler ultrasound measured middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAv) to estimate CBF. Results showed that ML, AE and ML + AE conditions increased MCAv; however, only the latter two conditions produced a pre- to post-intervention reduction in antisaccade RTs and the benefit was not linked to a MCAv change. Moreover, frequentist and Bayesian statistics indicated that the reduction in antisaccade RTs was equivalent across AE and ML + AE conditions. Accordingly, a single bout of exercise - and not a single bout of music listening - supports a non-additive post-intervention EF benefit that is not related to an exercise-based increase in CBF. Such findings suggest that exercise serves as a simple and cost-effective tool that can \"boost\" EF in advance of occupational- or educational-demanding tasks.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Music intervention is gaining recognition as a cost-effective therapeutic for improving human health. Despite its growing application, the mechanisms through which music exerts beneficial health effects remain largely unexplored. Here, we show that music can exert beneficial effects in mice through modulating gut microbiome composition. Adult mice were exposed to ambient noise, Mozart's Flute Quartet in D Major, K. 285, or white noise over a three-week period. Afterward, we observed treatment-specific changes in the community of gut commensal bacteria in these animals. Upon subsequent challenge with the bacterial pathogen Salmonella typhimurium, control groups exhibited significant weight loss and increased Salmonella colonization, whereas the Mozart-treated group did not. 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing revealed that the Mozart group showed a significant increase in Lactobacillus salivarius, a probiotic known for its antibacterial properties. Further experiments confirmed that L. salivarius mitigated Salmonella infection in mice and that L. salivarius acidified local environments in in vitro culture, thus inhibiting Salmonella growth. Additionally, mice exposed to Mozart consumed more food but showed similar body weight compared to the control groups. Behavioral assessments, including open field and object location tests, revealed that Mozart-treated mice were more active, less anxious, and exhibited enhanced spatial memory. Finally, Mozart exposure was shown to significantly boost colonization of administered L. salivarius and alter gut metabolite profiles. These findings suggest that music exposure fosters healthier gut microbiota, enhancing resistance to bacterial infections and highlighting the potential of music therapy as a novel strategy to combat drug-resistant pathogen infections. IMPORTANCE: Music therapy is increasingly recognized as a low-cost approach to improving health, but how it works remains unclear. Our study demonstrates that music can positively influence health by altering the gut microbiome. In a mouse model, exposure to Mozart's Flute Quartet in D Major enhanced the gut microbiota, specifically increasing levels of the beneficial bacterium Lactobacillus salivarius. This probiotic protected mice from Salmonella infection by creating an acidic environment that inhibited pathogen growth. Mozart-treated mice also showed reduced anxiety, better spatial memory, and higher food intake without weight gain, suggesting the benefits of music exposure. These findings reveal a novel link between music, gut health, and disease resistance, suggesting that music therapy could be a promising strategy for enhancing gut microbiota and combating infections, including those caused by drug-resistant bacteria."

Emergent themes were extracted from four major topics, including: (1) experience and history, (2) enjoyment and preferences, (3) confidence and barriers, and (4) impressions of music and dance as therapeutic tools.ResultsThematic analysis revealed participants' positive impressions of music and dance as potential therapeutic interventions, citing perceived neuropsychological, emotional, and physical benefits. Participants viewed music and dance as integral to their lives, histories, and identities within a culture, family, and/ or community. Participants also identified lifelong engagement barriers that, in conjunction with negative feedback, instilled persistent low self-efficacy regarding dancing and active music engagement. Questionnaires verified individuals' moderately-strong music and dance relationships, which were strongest in passive forms of music engagement (e.g., listening).ConclusionsOur findings support that individuals' music and dance relationships and the associated perceptions toward music and dance therapy may offer valuable insights that enhance the design of efficacious and engaging non-pharmacological therapies for individuals with MCI."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Nurses often experience high levels of physical and psychological stress due to frequent exposure to emergency and critical situations, which can adversely affect their professional performance. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the short- and long-term impacts of combining aromatherapy with music therapy versus using aromatherapy alone on the physical and psychological well-being of nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: This study employed a quasi-experimental design without non-intervention control group and recruited 60 nurses from a regional teaching hospital in central Taiwan between February and November 2023. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups: one group received aromatherapy, and the other group received a combination of aromatherapy and music therapy. The aromatherapy intervention involved inhaling gas infused with lavender essential oil. The intervention was conducted once a week during the lunch break for 20 min over a six-week period. Physiological and psychological indicators were compared before and after the intervention. Physiological indicators included systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and pulse rate (PR). Psychological indicators included scores on the Nursing Stress Scale (NSS), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), which measured stress, anxiety, and depression, respectively. RESULTS: Overall, after each aromatherapy intervention, the physiological and psychological measures of the nurses in both groups showed significant reductions (p < 0.05) based on paired t-tests. After six measurements, a one-way repeated measures ANOVA was conducted, revealing that most physiological and psychological measures of the nurses in the aromatherapy-only group were significantly reduced (p < 0.05), although no significant differences were found for diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate. In the group receiving aromatherapy combined with music therapy, all physiological and psychological measures showed significant reductions in repeated measures tests (p < 0.05). These results suggest that aromatherapy combined with music therapy not only improved physical and psychological symptoms immediately but also had lasting effects for at least six weeks. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that aromatherapy effectively reduced the physical and psychological stress of nurses, with even greater benefits when combined with music therapy. This approach not only provided immediate effects but also were associated with lasting benefits for an extended duration.",

Aims of this study were to assess whether patient-selected music during fractional ablative laser procedures enhances the patient experience, reduces perception of pain and anxiety, and impacts whether the patient would recommend the treatment to others and choose the treatment again. METHODS: Patients were 18 or over, receiving ablative fractional carbon dioxide laser treatment for any cause. Patients were offered to select the music played during their treatment and then asked to fill in a feedback questionnaire post treatment. RESULTS: A significant majority of 83.3% reported that the music enhanced their experience compared to previous treatments or compared to what they expected (25/30, p < .001). Music also significantly improved the likelihood that patients would recommend the treatment to others (n = 14, p < .05). CONCLUSION: Music significantly enhances the experience of patients undergoing ablative fractional carbon dioxide laser resurfacing and increases the likelihood they will recommend the treatment to others. This appears to be independent of any perceived change in levels of pain or anxiety.",

First, we synthesise extant literature on suicide risk among musicians from around the world, including emerging evidence from Korea, and evaluate some of the methodological challenges presented in the analysis of suicide data on musicians. Second, given the lack of musician-specific forms of suicide prevention intervention, we draw on the Zero Suicide Framework and apply this schematic to musicians and the wider music industries, analysing the latest evidence on suicide screening, assessment, and prevention to develop best practices in this at-risk population. In doing so, we offer a comprehensive and clinically relevant overview of this most tragic of cultural affinities to improve strategies to prevent this devastating and all too frequent feature of musical life.",

      "abstract": "The incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the concurrent cost of healthcare will increase as the population continues to age. Pharmaceutical interventions effectively manage symptoms of AD but carry side effects and ineffectively address underlying causes and disease prevention. Non-pharmaceutical interventions for AD, such as music training and therapy do not carry these side effects and can improve symptoms, and should therefore be explored as stand-alone or co-therapy for AD. In addition, music encapsulates modifiable lifestyle factors, such as cognitive stimulation, that have been shown to delay progression of and prevent AD. However, the neural mechanisms underpinning how music improves AD symptoms are not fully understood and whether music can target compensatory processes, activate neural networks, or even slow or prevent AD needs further research. Research suggests neural mechanism may involve stimulating brain areas to promote neurogenesis, dopaminergic rewards systems, and the default mode network (DMN). Alternatively, this review proposes that music improve symptoms of AD via the fronto-parietal control network (FPCN), the salience network (SN) and DMN, and neural compensation. This review will then present evidence for how music could activate the FPCN, SN, and DMN to improve their efficiency, organization, and cognitive functions they govern, protecting the brain from damage, slowing progression, and possibly preventing AD. Establishing how music improves symptoms of AD can lead to tailored music therapy protocols that target functional neural networks responsible for impaired executive functions common in AD."

However, clinical trials investigating the effects of MT on psychological and psychobiological stress-related outcomes in women suffering from MDD are still scarce. This study was conducted as a randomised controlled trial, with participants assigned to either an intervention group (IG), which received group MT (GMT), or a waitlist control group (CG), which received GMT 6 months later. The primary objective was to assess the impact of GMT on psychological stress outcomes (chronic stress, stress coping, and stress experienced in daily life) and psychobiological stress markers (diurnal salivary cortisol levels and circadian heart rate variability), considering the effects of both group allocation and time. Outcome measurements were taken before, immediately after, and-for some variables-10 weeks following the intervention period. A total of 102 women 18-65 years old and diagnosed with current MDD took part in the study. Overall, the IG demonstrated significantly stronger stress-reducing effects than the CG. Significant improvements were observed in general stress coping, positive thinking, daily life stress, and cortisol levels. GMT is a cost-effective and non-invasive approach to effectively address the stress-related psychological and psychobiological burden associated with MDD. To demonstrate long-term effects and gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms, further methodologically robust studies are needed.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Music performance anxiety (MPA) significantly impacts musicians' wellbeing and career development, yet the complex interplay between professional competence, psychological risk, and resilience in MPA formation remains understudied. METHODS: This research investigated these mechanisms through a moderated mediation model among 609 music major students (70.9% female; M age = 20.96 years, SD = 4.52). Participants completed a comprehensive assessment battery including the Professional Questionnaire for Musicians (PQM), Psychological Risk Questionnaire for Musicians (PRQM), Kenny Music Performance Anxiety Inventory (K-MPAI), and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC). Data were analyzed using SPSS 26.0 and PROCESS macro (Model 7). RESULTS: Analysis revealed significant negative correlations between professional competence and both performance anxiety (r = -0.252, p < 0.01) and psychological risk (r = -0.448, p < 0.01). Psychological risk significantly mediated the relationship between professional competence and performance anxiety (indirect effect = -0.171, 95% CI [-0.243, -0.099]). Notably, psychological resilience moderated this indirect effect (moderation effect = 0.188, 95% CI [0.092, 0.284]), with the relationship being strongest at low resilience levels (β = -0.881, p < 0.001) and weakest at high resilience levels (β = -0.693, p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: These findings validate a complex mechanism wherein professional competence influences performance anxiety through psychological risk, with psychological resilience serving as a crucial moderating factor. The results emphasize the importance of developing multidimensional intervention strategies and provide empirically-grounded guidance for music education practice, suggesting that enhancing both professional competence and psychological resilience may effectively reduce performance anxiety through the mitigation of psychological risk."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recovery constitutes the goal for people with alcohol use disorder (AUD). State hope and abstinence self-efficacy represent consequential constructs for people with AUD as they work toward recovery. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this two-group cluster-randomized single-session effectiveness study was to compare the effects of group motivational-educational songwriting (MESW) and group recreational music therapy (RMT) by measuring between- and within-group differences in measures of state hope and abstinence self-efficacy in adults with AUD on a detoxification unit. METHOD: Participants (N = 86) were cluster-randomized to a single-session of group MESW or group RMT. Participants completed psychometric inventories measuring state hope (consisting of agency and pathways subscales as well as total state hope) and abstinence self-efficacy (consisting of temptation and confidence subscales) at pre- and posttest. RESULTS: Analyses indicated statistically significant within-group changes in agency, pathways, total state hope, temptation, and confidence. In all measures, there were favorable changes from pre- to posttest. There were statistically significant between-group differences in pathways and total state hope, with the MESW condition outperforming the RMT condition. CONCLUSION: A single group MESW or group RMT session can positively influence state hope and abstinence self-efficacy in adults with AUD on a detoxification unit. As the MESW condition explicitly addressed recovery, has other empirical support in the literature, and significantly outperformed the RMT condition in measures of pathways and total state hope, MESW may be an ideal intervention for adults in detoxification settings. Implications for practice, limitations, and suggestions for future research are provided.",

METHODS: A two-phase randomized controlled trial conducted in Damascus, Syria. The participants were college students aged 18-24 who met specific criteria and were randomly assigned to either a music intervention group or a control group. State anxiety was measured pre- and post-intervention using the spielberger state anxiety inventory (STAI-S). RESULTS: In total, 69 participants were included in this study. The mean score decreased non-significantly in the intervention group (37.9-36.8, p = 0.258) and the control group (46-43.6, p = 0.444). The changes in the anxiety score on phase 2 were insignificant between both study arms (p = 0.622). These results indicate that music has no significant effect on STAI scores. CONCLUSION: Our study did not find evidence supporting the anxiety-reducing effects of a brief exposure to a unified piece of music (Oriental Jazz). Given these findings, this intervention does not appear to have benefits for reducing anxiety when applied before lectures. Future investigations should consider personalized music interventions, duration, and individual preferences."

This study aims to examine the effectiveness of music therapy, conventional and VR-enhanced, in improving graduate students' mental well-being and reducing their anxiety level. The study involved 270 fourth-year undergraduate students from three universities in China. Using the Chinese versions of the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS) and the Test Anxiety Scale (TAS), the study found that the control group experienced the worsening of mental well-being and higher anxiety when compared to baseline, with the mean differences of 2.62 and 2.60 points, respectively. The conventional music therapy group exhibited an improvement in mental well-being of 3.81 points, whereas their anxiety level decreased by 3.53 points. The effects of the intervention were even more pronounced in the VR-MT group, with an increase in the WEMWBS score of 7.48 points and a decrease in the anxiety score of 6.36 points. The results provided strong evidence of significant differences between the three conditions (p < 0.001). This study provides empirical evidence that VR-enhanced music therapy is a more effective method for reducing anxiety and improving mental health than the conventional approach.",

      "abstract": "Background Thyroid cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the thyroid gland. Thyroid cancer is characterized by the abnormal and uncontrolled growth of cells within the thyroid gland. In recent years, the incidence of thyroid cancer has been rising globally, with a significant increase observed in India. It is more prevalent among females, who are three times more likely to be diagnosed with thyroid cancer than males. According to recent statistics, thyroid cancer constitutes approximately 4%-6% of all cancers among Indian women, with an estimated incidence rate of 8.7 per 100,000 women. Thyroidectomy is a technique performed to manage thyroid cancer. Females who undergo thyroidectomy and receive insufficient levothyroxine supplementation are more prone to experience problems such as fatigue, which can significantly affect their quality of life (QoL). Fatigue is a prevalent and discomforting symptom among oncology patients, though its prevalence can vary depending on cancer type, stage, and treatment. Exercise is becoming widely recognized as a management strategy for fatigue and for enhancing QoL. This study aims to evaluate the effects of aerobic exercise and music therapy on fatigue and QoL in females who have undergone thyroidectomy due to thyroid cancer. Fatigue will be measured using the Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS), while QoL will be assessed through the RAND SF-36 Questionnaire. The study seeks to determine how these combined interventions may help improve both physical and mental well-being in this population. Method The study was conducted in the physiotherapy outpatient department of Acharya Vinoba Bhave Rural Hospital over a duration of six months, using an experimental interventional design. A total of 30 female participants, all of whom have undergone thyroidectomy due to thyroid cancer, were selected through a simple random sampling method with allocation based on a computer-generated list. Female participants will ensure completion of the six-week session. As interventions, both aerobic exercises and music therapy were combined. The RAND SF-36 Questionnaire and FAS were utilized to examine QoL and fatigue levels before and after treatment. The student-paired t-test was applied to compare pre- and post-treatment outcomes. Result  Following six weeks of interventions, the fatigue symptom was reduced, resulting in a considerable enhancement in QoL. Post-intervention the FAS (t=13.37, p=0.0001) and RAND SF-36 (t=14.09, p=0.0001) scores improved more significantly. The level of significance was found to be p<0.0001. Conclusion Based on the findings of this study, it can be concluded that the combination of aerobic exercises and music therapy has a positive impact on the QoL of females who have undergone thyroidectomy. Additionally, these interventions were found to effectively reduce fatigue symptoms in this population. These results underscore the potential benefits of integrating aerobic exercises and music therapy into post-thyroidectomy care strategies for enhancing overall well-being."

METHODS: Open-ended interviews and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). The analysis involves both individual and more generalized investigations based on the contributions from seven participants. FINDINGS: The findings show that music is an integrated and habitual aspect of the adolescents' daily lives, used as a tool for emotion regulation, cognitive enhancement, and creating personal space where one can be free from outside criticisms and distractions. There is a preference for music listening in headphones which creates a more intense and private experience. There are varying levels of awareness of the potential hearing-health risks, but the profound meaning of music for their well-being often overshadows any concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Despite awareness of potential hearing-health risks, the adolescents prioritize the immediate emotional and cognitive benefits of music. Technological advancements and increased social media interactions contribute to a trend towards more personalized music listening. These insights call for more complex intervention strategies and models for health promotion which account for the positive aspects of music listening, instead of merely focusing on the potential risks of loud music.",

Efficient delivery of a music listening intervention can be enhanced through digital tools such as a mobile application (app) loaded onto an electronic tablet device. The objective of this study is to describe the iterative development and deployment of a novel app (Soundese) to deliver, record, and retrieve data associated with a two-arm randomized, blinded clinical trial testing music listening intervention compared to control silence condition on delirium severity among critically ill intensive care unit (ICU) older adult patients receiving mechanical ventilatory support. The Soundese mobile app was developed to deliver either experimental music listening intervention or a silence control listening condition to a sample of older adults receiving mechanical ventilatory support in the ICU and retrieve all protocol data. The Soundese app was developed using the Swift software language and is compatible with all iOS devices. The Soundese app consists of two components: (1) a mobile app that delivers the assigned, blinded listening intervention from an iPad through headphones to each subject and automatically logs each listening session, its duration, the randomization arm, and uploads these data to a server, and (2) an analysis app that generates a spreadsheet with summarized data of the respective listening session, music details, and reports for further analyses. A Dropbox application programmer interface enabled the secure storage of files on a designated Dropbox account. After initial field testing and iterative development changes based on research staff feedback, the Soundese app delivers the assigned experimental listening condition or silence control condition when deployed remotely in the field. The app's mobile nature allows for immediate and automatic data capture, which is summarized for statistical analysis. There is no need for any manual recording of any intervention data by busy ICU staff, including listening time or music selections. The Soundese mobile app efficiently delivers the research protocol with fidelity and collects the necessary data for an ICU-based clinical trial. The app may be useful in other clinical trials testing music listening interventions in various settings or for deploying other audio-based interventions."

      "abstract": "Background Perioperative anxiety is a common concern in patients undergoing regional anesthesia, as they remain conscious during surgery. Various non-pharmacological interventions, including music therapy, have been explored to reduce anxiety and stress response. Spiritual interventions, particularly religious music, have been shown to provide emotional stability and enhance coping mechanisms during stressful situations. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the impact of Hindu religious music compared to patient-selected instrumental music on intraoperative anxiety, stress response, and patient satisfaction in individuals undergoing lower limb surgery under regional anesthesia. Methods This prospective, open-label, randomized controlled trial was conducted at Maharani Laxmi Bai Medical College, a tertiary care teaching hospital in Jhansi, India, after obtaining approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee (Certificate No. 5208/IEC/I/2022-2023) and registration with the Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI/2024/01/062006, registered on January 30, 2024). The trial included 150 ASA class 1 or 2 patients undergoing elective lower limb surgery under regional anesthesia. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups: Group A (Hindu spiritual music) and Group B (patient-preferred instrumental music). Music was played intraoperatively via noise-canceling headphones. The primary outcomes were intraoperative anxiety (measured using the Visual Analog Scale for Anxiety (VAS-A)) and serum cortisol levels as a biochemical marker of stress. Secondary outcomes included hemodynamic parameters, additional analgesic requirements, incidence of nausea and vomiting, and patient satisfaction. Results Group A had significantly lower intraoperative VAS-A scores compared to Group B (2.13 ± 0.91 vs. 3.41 ± 1.12; p = 0.01). Serum cortisol levels were also significantly lower in Group A at the end of surgery (28.54 ± 6.11 vs. 32.50 ± 8.82 µg/dL; p = 0.001) and remained lower on the first postoperative day (p = 0.001). The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting was significantly lower in Group A (6.8% vs. 17.5%; p = 0.028). Patient satisfaction was also higher in the Hindu spiritual music group (p = 0.03). Conclusion Hindu spiritual music reduced perioperative anxiety, attenuated the stress response, and decreased postoperative nausea and vomiting compared to non-spiritual instrumental music. It should be considered a non-pharmacological intervention in the perioperative period to alleviate anxiety and improve patient comfort. However, the study's findings may have limited generalizability to non-Hindu patients. Future research should explore whether similar benefits are observed in religious individuals listening to music of their own faith and cultural background."

Research suggests that music interventions, both active and passive, may be an effective complementary method of addressing ADHD challenges. This narrative review discusses seven potential neurocognitive mechanisms through which music interventions may help mitigate or alleviate ADHD symptoms, including executive function enhancement, timing improvement, arousal regulation, default mode network modulation, neural entrainment, affective management, and social bonding facilitation. Our study synthesized evidence from ADHD-specific studies and examined parallels to other populations to identify possible pathways through which music therapy could exert its effect. The paper also discusses the implications of individualized music interventions tailored to specific neurocognitive profiles in ADHD, advocating additional research to refine and optimize these approaches. Overall, music therapy has substantial potential as a complementary treatment for ADHD, offering new avenues for addressing the psychosocial and cognitive aspects of this condition."

EEG and ECG data were also collected during the experiment. The results showed that 5 min of Mozart K488 music resulted in improved CNV task performance in the musical intervention group. For EEG data, recoveries of the initial CNV and terminal CNV amplitude in Cz and CPz electrodes were observed and compared with the values after Mental Fatigue, which music increased the iCNV and tCNV. Alpha-ERD was lower after listening to music than after resting. Moreover, during music playing, compared to other brain regions the EEG alpha power of participants was significantly high in the central frontal region. This study demonstrates a short-term musical intervention can effectively boost the recovery of attention after Mental Fatigue.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: As individuals age, their cognitive function gradually declines. However, maintaining good cognitive function is essential for successful ageing. Music therapy may improve cognitive function or delay cognitive decline among older adults. However, the efficacy of music therapy for improving cognition remains unclear. This review aimed to evaluate the effects of music therapy on cognitive function (global cognition, memory, or executive function) among older adults. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Nine electronic databases were comprehensively searched from inception to 3 November 2023 to identify randomized controlled trials examining the effects of music therapy on cognitive function among older adults. The revised Cochrane Risk of Bias in Randomized Trials tool (ROB 2) was used to assess the risk of bias, and Stata 17.0 software was used to conduct the meta-analysis. Standard mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the effects of music therapy on cognitive function. RESULTS: Thirty-three eligible articles involving 3,058 participants were included. The results revealed that music therapy significantly improved global cognition (SMD = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.28~0.52, p < 0.05, I2 =38%), memory (SMD = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.13~0.37, p < 0.05, I2 =16%), and executive function (SMD = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.25~0.48, p < 0.05, I2 =26%) among older adults. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis verified the positive effects of music therapy on cognitive function in older adults. More research is needed to determine the best form and timing of interventions for different populations."

      "abstract": "AIM: To determine the effect of virtual reality glasses accompanied by music during episiotomy repair on women's perceived pain, vital signs, and postnatal comfort. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized controlled experimental study utilized the \"VAS pain score\" and \"Postpartum Comfort Scale\" to collect data. All participants received 5 mL of lidocaine during episiotomy repair. Women in the experimental group listened to the tune of Acemashiran and watched a natural landscape with virtual reality glasses (VRG) while undergoing episiotomy repair, whereas those in the control group did not undergo any intervention during the procedure. p < .05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The results showed that the episiotomy repair time was perceived as shorter in the experimental group than in the control group. VAS pain scores were significantly lower in the experimental group (during: 5, after: 2) than in the control group (during: 7, after: 4). There were no significant differences in vital sign measurements among participants before, during, and after episiotomy repair. The experimental group exhibited higher postpartum comfort scale scores (E: 4.20 ± 0.36/ C 3.99 ± 0.55). CONCLUSION: The study concluded that combining VRG application with music resulted in a perceived reduction in episiotomy repair time. The visual and auditory stimuli contributed to pain management during and after episiotomy repair. Additionally, virtual glasses may reduce the need for pharmacological medication due to this reduction in pain during episiotomy repair. KEY PRACTICE POINTS: This study provides evidence for the effectiveness of non-pharmacologic interventions for episiotomy repair, patients and facilitates support for future clinical trials and work.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: One of the most important challenges that preterm infants face is nutritional problems. Poor postnatal weight gain can lead to various complications. PURPOSE: To determine the effects of listening to the Holy Quran on the feeding status, postnatal weight gain, and length of hospital stay of preterm infants. METHODS: The current randomized clinical trial was conducted in the city of Qazvin in 2024. The samples included 80 preterm infants hospitalized in neonatal intensive care unit, who were randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups (40 in the Holy Quran recitation group and 40 in the control group). In addition to the routine care, the participants in the intervention group listened to the Holy Quran via headphones for 20 minutes 3 times a day, whereas the participants in the control group did not receive any intervention. RESULTS: The mean days to achieve the first oral feeding ( P < .001), the mean days to achieve full oral feeding ( P < .001), the mean weight gain at the time of achieving the first oral feeding ( P < .046), and the mean length of hospital stay ( P < .001) were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND RESEARCH: In addition to standard treatments, listening to the Holy Quran, as a complementary method, can improve some parameters related to feeding and the quicker discharge of preterm infants.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Vision impairment (VI) has a profound impact on mental health and well-being. Music-based interventions, such as active music listening, have potential to induce relaxation, improve mood, and reduce stress. This study investigated the feasibility and acceptability of a supportive self-care music intervention in adults with acquired VI, who ran their listening program independently. METHODS: A two-arm, parallel-group, single-blind feasibility randomised controlled trial compared: (1) daily music listening with brief mindfulness instructions and (2) daily music listening alone. The study adhered to the CONSORT extension for pilot and feasibility trials and the music reporting checklist. Feasibility was determined by collecting data on attrition, through recruitment and retention at pre-post and 3-month follow-up, including adherence and fidelity which were determined by participants' questionnaire and daily log completion, respectively. Acceptability was determined through data capture in the questionnaires. To assess whether the music intervention had an impact on anxiety and depression and stress, the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14) were used. RESULTS: Eighty-one VI participants were randomised to mindful music listening (n = 41) or music listening alone (n = 40), with 85% (n = 69) completing the intervention (post intervention end-point). A rating of 'highly satisfied' was given for the intervention by 77% (n = 53) of participants. Feasibility was determined through retention which was 71% at the three-month follow-up, and adherence to the daily log completion, which was low (16%), resulting in insufficient data to assess fidelity to the music listening. HADS and PSS-14 data indicated a reduction in anxiety, depression and stress at post-intervention phase. CONCLUSIONS: The recruitment and retention rates suggest that an efficacy study is feasible. However, adherence to daily log completion was low, resulting in uncertainty regarding the fidelity of the listening conditions. While completing the daily logs was not required in this study, it should be mandatory in future trials. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/, identifier NCT05243732."

      "abstract": "Mental health disorders and cognitive decline are pressing global concerns, increasing the demand for non-pharmacological interventions targeting emotional dysregulation, memory deficits, and neural dysfunction. This review systematically examines three promising methodologies-music therapy, brainwave entrainment (binaural beats, isochronic tones, multisensory stimulation), and their integration into a unified therapeutic paradigm. Emerging evidence indicates that music therapy modulates affect, reduces stress, and enhances cognition by engaging limbic, prefrontal, and reward circuits. Brainwave entrainment, particularly within the gamma frequency range (30-100 Hz), facilitates neural oscillatory patterns linked to relaxation, concentration, and memory, with 40 Hz showing promise for cognitive enhancement, albeit with individual variability. Synchronized multisensory stimulation, combining auditory and visual inputs at gamma frequencies, has demonstrated potential in enhancing memory and supporting neural integrity, particularly in Alzheimer's disease. However, challenges such as patient response variability, lack of standardization, and scalability hinder widespread implementation. Recent research suggests that a synergistic application of these modalities may optimize therapeutic outcomes by leveraging complementary mechanisms. To actualize this, AI-driven biofeedback, enabling real-time physiological assessment and individualized adjustments-such as tailoring musical complexity, entrainment frequencies, and multisensory components-emerges as a promising solution. This adaptive model enhances treatment accessibility and consistency while maximizing long-term efficacy. Although in early stages, preliminary evidence highlights its transformative potential in reshaping non-pharmacological therapeutic strategies. Advancing this field requires interdisciplinary research, rigorous evaluation, and ethical data stewardship to develop innovative, patient-centered solutions for mental health and cognitive rehabilitation."

      "abstract": "Music can effectively influence human emotions, with different melodies and rhythms eliciting varying emotional responses. Among these, tempo is one of the most important parameters affecting emotions. This study explores the impact of music tempo on emotional states and the associated brain functional networks. A total of 26 participants without any history of neurological or psychiatric disorders and music training took part in the experiment, using classical piano music clips at different tempi (56, 106, 156 bpm) as stimuli. The study was conducted using emotional scales and electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis. The results showed that the valence level of emotions significantly increased with music tempo, while the arousal level exhibited a \"V\" shape relationship. EEG analysis revealed significant changes in brainwave signals across different frequency bands under different tempi. For instance, slow tempo induced higher Theta and Alpha power in the frontal region, while fast tempo increased Beta and Gamma band power. Moreover, fast tempo enhanced the average connectivity strength in the frontal, temporal, and occipital regions, and increased phase synchrony value (PLV) between the frontal and parietal regions. However, slow tempo improves PLV between the occipital and parietal regions. The findings of this study elucidate the effects of music tempo on the brain functional networks related to emotion regulation, providing a theoretical basis for music-assisted diagnosis and treatment of mood disorders. Furthermore, these results suggest potential applications in emotion robotics, emotion-based human-computer interaction, and emotion-based intelligent control.",

OBJECTIVE: This study examined the potential synergistic effects of low dose of CAF and warm-up music on subsequent taekwondo combat outcomes. METHODS: In a double-blinded, randomized, crossover study, 16 male taekwondo athletes performed simulated combats under six conditions: (a) control, (b) CAF without music (CAF + NM), (c) placebo without music (PL + NM), (d) CAF with music (CAF + M), (e) PL with music (PL + M), and (f) no supplement with music (NS + M). After warming-up, athletes rated their felt arousal (FAS). Perceived exertion (RPE), feeling scale (FS), FAS, and physical enjoyment (PACES) were determined after combat while mean (HRmean) and peak (HRpeak) heart rate were determined for each bout. Each combat was analyzed to determine time-motion aspects and technical-tactical skills. RESULTS: CAF + M shortened skip and pause times than CAF and music in single-use (p < 0.05), while extend attack time than other conditions (p < 0.001). Additionally, CAF + M increased attacks and defensive actions above that of single treatment conditions (all p < 0.05). Moreover, CAF + M improved FS and FAS post-combat than the other conditions (p < 0.001) and PACES compared to NS + M, PL + NM and PL + M conditions (p < 0.05). Similarly, CAF + M reduced HRmean and HRpeak than the other conditions (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Combining low dose of CAF and warm-up music could be an effective strategy to enhance taekwondo combat performance in male athletes."
