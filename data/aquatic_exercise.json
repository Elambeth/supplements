      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Aquatic exercise therapy has gained recognition as a valuable non-pharmacological intervention for managing musculoskeletal disorders. Despite the growing body of evidence supporting its efficacy, research on aquatic exercise therapy remains fragmented, with limited understanding of key trends, influential studies, and evolving themes within the field. This study aims to conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis to identify publication trends, key authors, and the evolution of research themes in aquatic exercise therapy for musculoskeletal disorders. METHODS: A total of 117 articles were selected based on predefined search terms and inclusion criteria, resulting in 3,985 citations, with an average of 35.9 citations per article and an H-index of 37. RESULTS: Publications surged between 2013 and 2024, accounting for 88.3% of total output. Peaks occurred in 2019 (n = 14) and 2022 (n = 368 citations). Key contributors include Mariana Arias Avila and Basia Belza, with journals such as BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders and Arthritis & Rheumatism-Arthritis Care & Research playing pivotal roles. Research trends shifted from disease-specific studies to broader quality-of-life outcomes, with keywords such as \"rheumatoid arthritis\", \"balneotherapy\", and \"quality of life\" emerging as focal points. CONCLUSION: The findings underscore the growing importance of aquatic exercise therapy in clinical rehabilitation and suggest that future research should focus on long-term outcomes, underrepresented populations, and the integration of aquatic exercise therapy with emerging rehabilitation technologies.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: A randomized-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of a 6-month self-paced aquatic exercise intervention on physical function, symptoms and psychosocial measures in individuals with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). METHODS: Thirty-two individuals diagnosed with ME/CFS (55.0 ± 13.9 yr) were randomized into an intervention group (INT, n = 17) or control group (CON, n = 15) for a 6-month trial of two 20-min sessions per week of self-paced aquatic movements and stretches. Pre- and post-intervention outcomes included physiological measures, 6-min walk test, hand-grip strength, Sit-to-Stand, Apley's shoulder test, Sit-Reach test, perceived exertion, fatigue (FACIT), anxiety/depression (HADS) questionnaires, and tiredness and pain scores (VAS 0-10 scale). RESULTS: The INT group significantly increased walk test distance (13.7%, P < 0.001), Sit-to-Stand scores (33.7%, P < 0.001) and peak expiratory pulmonary flow (12.9%, P = 0.028) post-intervention. Fatigue (29.5%, P = 0.005), depression (21.7%, P = 0.010), combined anxiety/depression scores (16.9%, P = 0.047) and resting diastolic blood pressure (4.8%, P < 0.001) also significantly improved for the INT group. Sit-Reach scores were significantly lower for the INT group compared to CON post-intervention (- 4.0 ± 10.4 vs + 4.3 ± 10.7 cm, P = 0.034). There were no adverse events or worsening of symptoms during the trial. CONCLUSIONS: Self-paced, low-moderate-intensity aquatic exercise improved walk distance, lower limb strength, fatigue, depression and peak expiratory flow without worsening ME/CFS symptoms. This mode of low-intensity physical activity may confer mental health and physical benefits provided the activity is self-paced and within patient energy limits.

      "abstract": "Background Flatfoot is a condition characterized by a diminished or absent medial longitudinal arch, which can lead to pain, altered biomechanics, and reduced functional performance. Overweight adolescents with functional flat feet are particularly at risk due to increased weight-bearing stress, which exacerbates symptoms and impacts daily activities. Aquatic exercise, known for its low-impact nature and supportive environment, has shown promise in alleviating pain and improving functional performance in musculoskeletal conditions. However, its specific effects on functional flat feet in overweight adolescents remain underexplored. Objective To evaluate the impact of an aquatic exercise program on pain reduction and functional performance in overweight adolescent runners with functional flat feet. Methods This was a comparative study conducted at Krishna College of Physiotherapy, Karad. Ninety-two participants of the age group 13-19 were taken according to inclusion criteria and by using Foot Posture Index-6 and navicular drop test. Participants were divided using a simple random sampling technique and assessed using three outcome measures: the Visual Analog Scale, Clarke's angle, and the 50-meter sprint run test. Results The study interpreted those overweight adolescent runners with functional flat feet exhibited significant improvement in group B than group A. The aquatic exercise program showed extremely significant results (p<0.0001) in the outcomes; Visual Analog Scale, Clarke's angle, and 50-meter sprint run test than the land-based exercise program. Conclusion The study concluded that the aquatic exercise program had a significant impact on the outcomes of Visual Analog Scale, Clarke's angle, and 50-meter sprint run test. The unique properties of water, including buoyancy and resistance, facilitated enhanced strength, flexibility, and stability while minimizing joint stress. Aquatic exercises led to significantly greater improvements in pain reduction and functional performance compared to land-based exercises in overweight adolescent runners with functional flat feet."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cerebral palsy (CP) refers to a lasting motor impairment resulting from atypical brain development or injury. Aquatic exercise (AE) is frequently utilized as an approach for rehabilitating children with CP because of its appealing water properties. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine how AE influences motor skills in children affected by CP. METHODS: Systematic searches of databases provided randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published from their inception up until May 22, 2024. The study compared the impacts of AE training with those of routine rehabilitation training (RRT). A random-effects model was employed to assess the aggregated data. RESULTS: In total, 491 articles were retrieved, and 15 studies (n = 595 patients) were included in this study. Compared with RRT, AE improved the gross motor function of children with CP (SMD = 7.63, 95% CI 5.79-9.47, P < 0.01), especially in the lying and turning over positions (SMD = 15.66, 95% CI 13.85-17.46, P < 0.01). AE also reduced muscle tension (SMD = -0.75, 95% CI -1.03--0.47, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: AE is expected to improve motor function in children with CP. Moreover, this study emphasizes the need for future high-quality related studies to supplement the results and improve the conclusions."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To identify literature on aquatic exercise therapy used to manage upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders and identify key concepts, intervention components, and gaps in the evidence base. DATA SOURCES: The comprehensive search included MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCOHost), Embase (Ovid), CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) databases and grey literature sources. REVIEW METHODS: JBI Scoping review methodology guided this review through protocol development, searching, screening, data extraction and analysis. Study Selection included: Participants - Adults with upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders; Concept - Aquatic based exercise therapy; Context - any setting in any very highly developed nation. RESULTS: The search identified 5045 sources with 68 studies included in the final synthesis. Findings outlined shoulder problems were the most reported upper extremity condition treated (n = 78) especially following rotator cuff repair (n = 17), followed by the hand and wrist (n = 9), and elbow (n = 6). Range of movement (n = 36) and resistance exercises (n = 17) were the most common interventions reported for aquatic therapy, however compliance with reporting guidance across included studies was poor. Sixteen health domains were identified with range of movement (n = 21) and pain (n = 20) the most common, and 62 outcome measures were reported related to the identified domains. Qualitative aspects of aquatic interventions were evaluated in two papers. CONCLUSION: There is a need for more primary experimental and qualitative studies related to the upper extremity and aquatic therapy. Improved reporting quality of aquatic therapy exercise intervention is required as is the need to establish specific core outcome sets and domains in this area."

      "abstract": "Objective: In this study, the objective is to analyze the efficacy of different aquatic physical exercise programs in the treatment of osteoarthritis in older people. Material and Methods: The systematic review was conducted until April 2024 and updated in November 2024 in five electronic databases. Randomized controlled studies in people over 60 years of age with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis were included. Water-based exercise interventions were assessed for their impact on osteoarthritis symptoms, walking ability, muscle strength, depressive symptoms, range of motion, body composition, fear of falling, fall risk, quality of life, range of motion, and dual task function. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database. Results: A total of 12 studies were included, with sample sizes ranging from 35 to 312 participants. The presence of osteoarthritis in the sample was manifested in different joints. The methodological quality of the included studies varied from fair to good. Based on the results of this review, aquatic exercise significantly improved balance, stiffness, pain, and walking ability compared to non-exercise controls (p < 0.05). Compared with land-based exercise groups, only one study found significant differences between the two groups. Conclusions: Water-based exercise programs do not provide significantly superior benefits compared to other exercise modalities and appear to have limited effectiveness in the management of OA. However, the feasibility and high adherence make these programs a recommendable option for older people with OA. Future studies should investigate the impact of exercise intensity on the short- and long-term efficacy of aquatic therapy."

The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate whether aquatic exercise for children with CP improves their walking ability and quality of life (QOL) and is enjoyable for them. METHODS: A literature search was conducted on 2 August 2024 using three databases: PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews. Studies included in the review focused on aquatic exercise interventions for children with CP, with outcomes related to walking ability, QOL, or enjoyment. Studies that did not isolate the effects of aquatic exercise (except when combined with conventional interventions) were excluded. Two reviewers independently conducted screening and risk of bias assessments. RESULTS: Seven studies involving 94 participants in total were included in the review. Three of these studies had a control group. All four studies reported improvements in walking ability, including walking endurance and efficiency. One of two studies showed improvement in health-related QOL (HRQOL) compared to the control group, whereas the other did not show significant differences between groups. All three studies that assessed enjoyment reported high levels of enjoyment of aquatic exercise. However, all studies were at risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: The reviewed studies suggest that aquatic exercise for children with CP may be enjoyable and may improve walking ability. Further research is needed to accurately assess the effects of aquatic exercise and compare it to other interventions."

Aquatic exercises, which are widely used to enhance functional capacity, may play a role in stimulating cognitive functions. This study investigated the effects of a 3-month aquatic exercise program on cognitive functions in community-dwelling older adults. In this prospective, single-blinded, controlled clinical trial, 31 participants were allocated to either the experimental (aquatic exercises) or control (no-exercise) group. The intervention program consisted of exercises conducted twice a week in a 1.2 m deep indoor pool. The main outcome measures were cognitive functions, assessed using Raven's Progressive Matrices test and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to assess the impact of the exercise program. The effect sizes (η2p) were reported when a level of significance was achieved (p < 0.05). Compared with the control group, the participants who underwent aquatic exercises showed positive outcomes in Raven's Progressive Matrices test (p = 0.046; η2p = 0.131) and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (p = 0.001, η2p = 0.589). Complementary analyses of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test indicated that the benefits of the aquatic exercise were observed in terms of the number of trials (p = 0.001, η2p = 0.478), number of errors (p = 0.001, η2p = 0.458), and number of non-perseverative errors (p = 0.001, η2p = 0.302). The results indicate that a period of three months of aquatic exercise was beneficial for stimulating specific aspects of the cognitive function of community-dwelling older individuals. Aquatic exercise should be prescribed to this population."

This study aimed to investigate the effect of aquatic exercise combined with vitamin D supplementation on social interaction and two related cytokines (Interleukin-6 and Interleukin-10) in children with ASD. MATERIALS & METHODS: Forty boys with ASD (mean age: 10.90; age range: 6-14 years) were randomly assigned to the three interventions (groups 1, 2, and 3) and one control group (each 10 participants). Participants in the group 1 and 3 received a 10-week aquatic exercise program. Subjects in groups 2 and 3 took orally 50,000 IU of vitamin D3/week. This study evaluated the serum levels of IL-6 and IL-10, as well as the participants' social interaction at baseline and post-intervention. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, all three interventions improved social skills scores (p< 0.001). Surprisingly, the combination strategy could significantly reduce IL-6 and increase IL-10 serum levels in children with ASD. CONCLUSION: Aqua-based exercise programs combined with vitamin D supplementation are recommended to benefit children with ASD and improve social and communication dysfunction."

Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted until February 15, 2024, using multiple databases. Mean difference (MD) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results: Sixteen studies, comprising 349 participants with HF, were included. Water exercise led to enhancements in peak VO2 (MD, 2.85 mL/kg/min; 95% CI, 1.89 to 3.80; p < .00001) and resting heart rate (MD, -4.16 bm; 95% CI, -6.85 to -1.46; p = .002) compared to no exercising controls. Water plus land exercise reduced resting heart rate (MD, -1.41 bm; 95% CI, -2.13 to -0.69; p = .0001) compared to land exercise alone. Furthermore, acute water exercises decreased resting heart rate (MD, -3.85 bm; 95% CI, -6.49 to -1.21; p = .004) and increased stroke volume (MD, 14.68 mL/beat; 95% CI, 8.57 to 20.79; p < .00001) and cardiac output (MD, 0.5 L/min; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.73; p < .00001) compared to baseline. Conclusion: These findings suggest that water exercise holds promise as an effective intervention for enhancing functional capacity and hemodynamic parameters in individuals with HF, highlighting the importance of further research to optimize its implementation and elucidate long-term benefits.",

Additionally, the impact of aquatic exercise on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in children with ASD requires further investigation. AIMS: This study aimed to explore the effects of a 12-week aquatic exercise intervention on core EF and BDNF levels in children with ASD. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Thirty children with ASD were assigned to an experimental or control group. The experimental group underwent a 12-week aquatic exercise intervention, while the control group engaged in supervised free activities. Pre- and post-intervention assessments measured EF and BDNF levels. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: The experimental group showed significant improvements (p < 0.05) in inhibition control, cognitive flexibility, and BDNF levels. However, working memory did not significantly improve. The control group exhibited no significant changes in EF or BDNF levels. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Aquatic exercise appears to be a beneficial intervention for cognitive development in children with ASD, as it enhances inhibition control, cognitive flexibility, and BDNF levels in children with ASD. Furthermore, the observed improvements in EF following aquatic exercise intervention in children with ASD may be associated with increased BDNF levels.",

PURPOSE: This study compared the effects of aquatic exercise versus aerobic exercise on primary dysmenorrhea and QOL in adolescent females. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Sixty adolescent females suffering from primary dysmenorrhea with moderate to severe intensity were distributed randomly and equally into two groups was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06129708) the Registration Date, November 13, 2023; group A was treated by aquatic exercise for 12 weeks, while group B was treated by aerobic exercise for 12 weeks. Assessment of both groups before and after treatment involved evaluating dysmenorrhea severity using the WaLIDD Score, measuring pain intensity with the numeric pain rating scale (NPRS), determining pressure pain threshold (PPT) with an algometry, and evaluating the QOL using EuroQol-5 Dimension-3 Level (EQ-5D-3L) and EuroQol-visual analog scale (EQ-VAS). RESULTS: Both groups, A and B, experienced significant reductions in the WaLIDD score, NPRS, and all domains of EQ-5D-3L (p < 0.05), coupled with significant increases in PPT and EQ-VAS (p < 0.05). Posttreatment comparisons between the groups showed insignificant differences in WaLIDD score, NPRS, and PPT (p > 0.05). However, there was a significant decrease in EQ-5D-3L and a significant increase in EQ-VAS, favoring group A (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Both aquatic and aerobic exercises are effective methods in primary dysmenorrhea management and QOL improvement in adolescent females, with a better effect of aquatic exercise in enhancing QOL.",

The aim of this study was to synthesize scientific evidence on the effects of aquatic exercise programs on pain and quality of life in individuals with fibromyalgia. This review was carried out using the following databases in January 2024: Cochrane Library, PEDro, PubMed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science. Four clinical trials focusing on aquatic exercise as a treatment for patients with fibromyalgia were selected. These trials were published in English between 2019 and 2024. Pain recorded using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and quality of life with the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) or Fibromyalgia Impact on Quality of Life (FIQ) were the most commonly analyzed variables. This review was carried out according to the PRISMA statement and was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024510219). The results in terms of pain and quality of life were positive. In conclusion, these findings support the incorporation of aquatic exercise into fibromyalgia physical therapy treatment. However, the benefits could be equivalent to those of other exercise modalities, underscoring the need for individualized adaptation to each patient's needs."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exercise has shown positive effects on fatigue, exhaustion, neuropathy, and quality of life in cancer patients. While on-land exercises have been studied, the aquatic environment offers unique advantages. Water's density and viscosity provide resistance, enhancing muscle strength, while hydrostatic pressure improves venous return. This trial aims to investigate the effect of aquatic exercises on time to return to work, work hours, work-related difficulties, daily life activity and participation, quality of life, exhaustion, fatigue, and neuropathy among cancer patients, compared to on-land exercise intervention group and a non-exercise group. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial will include 150 cancer patients aged 18-65 years with stage III colon cancer or breast cancer patients with lymph node involvement. Participants in the aquatic exercise intervention group will undergo an 8-week, twice-weekly group-based Ai-Chi program, while the on-land exercise group will perform identical exercise. The control group will not engage in any exercise. The primary outcome will be assessed using an employment barriers questionnaire, capturing return to work date and working hours and daily life participation and activity and quality of life. Secondary outcomes include exhaustion, fatigue, and neuropathy. Data will be collected at baseline, post-intervention (8 weeks), and at 3,12, and 24 months. Mixed variance analyses will explore relationships among groups and over time for independent variables, with separate analyses for each dependent variable. DISCUSSION: The potential benefits include an earlier return to work for patients, reducing their need for social and economic support. The study's implications on socio-economic policies are noteworthy, as a successful intervention could offer a cost-effective and non-invasive solution, improving patients' quality of life and increasing their participation in daily activities. This, in turn, could lead to a faster return to work, contributing to both personal well-being and broader societal interests by reducing reliance on social services. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05427344 (22 June 2022).",

      "abstract": "Addressing overweight and obesity to promote healthy aging is essential. Exercise is an outstanding approach to manage metabolic and physical dysfunction. Aquatic exercise has been recommended for older individuals due to reduced weight pressure on joints. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of twenty-eight weeks of combined aquatic exercise (aerobic and resistance) in overweight healthy older individuals. Thirty-two subjects of both genders with mean age of 72.06 ± 5.8 years were randomly assigned into two groups: an aquatic exercise group (EG; n = 19) and a control group (CG; n = 13). Body composition, anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, lipid profile, fasting glucose, insulin, and leptin were assessed before and after the training program. The lipid profile, fasting glucose, leptin, insulin, and insulin resistance did not change between and within groups. The lipid profile worsened in the CG. Reduction in body fat mass, waist and leg circumferences, along with body mass gain in the aquatic exercise group was observed (p ≤ 0.05). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly improved in the exercise group (P = 0.003, P = 0.001). Significant differences were found in aerobic endurance (P = 0.008) and lower body flexibility (P = 0.049) of the aquatic exercise group compared with the control group. Also, upper body flexibility (P = 0.001, P = 0.020), lower and upper body strength (P = 0.001, P = 0.031), and handgrip (P = 0.001, P = 0.006), showed significant differences within the exercise group. Aquatic exercise may have a positive impact on the overweight aging population's metabolic and cardiovascular parameters, based on the observed improvements in blood pressure and body composition."

      "abstract": "Children with intellectual disabilities often face challenges in balance ability and lower limb muscle strength, which negatively impact their daily lives and motor function. Therefore, it is crucial to enhance the balance ability and lower limb muscle strength of children with intellectual disabilities. This study aimed to investigate the effects of a 12-week aquatic exercise and floor curling intervention on the balance ability and lower limb muscle strength of children with intellectual disabilities. Forty-two participants were randomly assigned to the aquatic exercise group, floor curling group, and control group. The aquatic exercise and floor curling groups received a 12-week intervention, while the control group engaged in supervised free activities. The participants' balance ability and lower limb muscle strength were assessed using the Berg Balance Scale and a muscle strength testing device before and after the intervention. The results showed significant improvements in balance ability and lower limb muscle strength for both the aquatic exercise group and the floor curling group after the intervention. The aquatic exercise group demonstrated an average improvement of 10.84% in balance ability and an overall average improvement of 16.28% in lower limb muscle strength. The floor curling group showed an average improvement of 9.04% in balance ability and an overall average improvement of 15.67% in lower limb muscle strength. These improvement results were statistically significant (p < 0.05) and ranged from medium to large effect sizes (d = 0.5~0.8). The findings of this study validate the positive effects of aquatic exercise and floor curling on the balance ability and lower limb muscle strength of children with intellectual disabilities. These interventions can be considered effective approaches for functional rehabilitation in children with intellectual disabilities."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most disabling diseases and a major health issue. Despite the evidence of a link between paraspinal and gluteal muscle dysfunction and LBP, it is unknown whether aquatic exercises can lead to improvements in paraspinal and gluteal muscle morphology and function, and whether improvements in overall muscle health are associated with improvements in patients' outcomes. The unique properties of water allow a water-based exercise program to be tailored to the needs of those suffering from LBP. This study uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the effect of an aquatic exercise program versus standard exercise on 1) paraspinal and gluteal muscle size, quality and strength and 2) pain, disability, and psychological factors (pain related fear, depression, anxiety, sleep quality) in chronic LBP. METHODS: This study will include 34 participants with chronic non-specific LBP and moderate to severe disability, aged between 18 and 65, who will be randomly assigned (1:1) to the aquatic exercise group or land-based standard care exercise group. Both groups will receive 20 supervised sessions, twice per week over 10 weeks. MRIs will be obtained along the lumbosacral spine (L1-L5) and pelvis at the start and end of the intervention to assess the effect of each exercise intervention on paraspinal and gluteal muscle size and quality. Pre- to post-intervention changes in all outcomes between each group will be assessed, and the association between the changes in back muscle quality and clinical outcomes will be examined. Between-subjects repeated measure analysis of variance will be used to examine the changes in paraspinal muscle morphology over the different time points. Linear mixed models will be used to assess whether baseline scores can modify the response to the exercise therapy treatment. DISCUSSION: This study will determine if water-based exercises targeting the lower back and gluteal muscles can lead to important changes in muscle quality and function, and their possible relation with patients' pain and functional improvements. Our findings will have strong clinical implications and provide preliminary data to design a community program to better support individuals with chronic LBP.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aquatic exercise (AE) is becoming ever more popular as a physical therapy, while it is unclear what precise improvements it will produce and how effective it will be in comparison with other non-surgical therapies. The study aimed to assess whether AE positively impacts chronic musculoskeletal disorder patients in terms of pain, physical function, and quality of life. METHODS: PRISMA guidelines were followed, and our study protocol was published online at PROSPERO under registration number CRD42023417411. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane library databases for English-language articles published before April 11, 2023, including studies from all relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). After screening, we ultimately included 32 RCTs with a total of 2,200 participants. We also performed subgroup analyses for all included studies. This meta-analysis calculated standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI), and the variance was estimated using a random-effects model. The quality of the included studies was assessed by using the Cochrane collaborative \"risk of bias\" assessment tool (version 2.0). Thus ensuring that the literature included is of high quality. RESULTS: This meta-analysis included 32 trials with 2,200 participants; these patients were all between the ages of 38-80. The study showed that compared to the no exercise (NE) group, patients in the AE group experienced a remarkable reduction in pain (SMD: -0.64, P < 0.001), a significant increase in physical function (SMD: 0.62, P < 0.001), and a statistically significant improvement in quality of life (SMD: -0.64, P < 0.001). When compared to land-based exercise (LE), AE significantly relieves patients' pain (SMD: -0.35, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to study whether AE could improve chronic musculoskeletal disorders. The evidence suggests that AE benefits pain, physical function, and quality of life in adults with chronic musculoskeletal conditions compared to NE. Furthermore, when compared to LE, AE continues to provide a better improvement in patient pain. More long-term clinical trials are needed to confirm AE's positive effects and improvement mechanisms and the more existential advantages compared to LE.",

The primary outcome was pain, and the secondary outcomes were FMS impact, quality of life, sleep and pain sensitivity (pressure pain thresholds - PPTs). Participants performed 45-min sessions of aquatic exercises, twice a week, for 12 weeks. PNG also received 4 PNE sessions during this period. Participants were assessed four times: initial (before treatment), after 6 weeks (intermediate) and 12 weeks (final) of treatment and after 12 weeks after the end of treatment (follow-up). RESULTS: Both groups improved pain after treatment, with no difference between them (p > 0.05, partial ƞ2 0.10). FMS impact and PPTs improved after treatment with no difference between groups, and sleep did not change. Quality of life improved several domains for both groups, with slightly better results for the PNG, with low effect sizes between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The present results show that the addition of PNE to an aquatic exercise intervention did not provide larger effects than aquatic exercises alone for people with FMS concerning pain intensity, but provided benefit for health-related quality of life for this population. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03073642, version 2, April 1st, 2019). PERSPECTIVE: The addition of 4 Pain Neuroscience Education sessions to an aquatic exercises protocol did not add benefits for women with fibromyalgia syndrome on pain, fibromyalgia impact, and sleep, but improved quality of life and pain sensitivity.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONAquatic exercises are commonly prescribed, but patient education is crucial for the treatment.The addition of Pain Neuroscience Education to an aquatic exercises protocol did not add benefits for women with fibromyalgia syndrome.The positive changes on quality of life and pain sensitivity that this combination led to had small effect sizes and did not achieve minimal important clinical difference.",

Methods: Two researchers independently searched the literature using the PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. The search period was from the establishment of the database to December 2021. The subject heading search included \"hydrotherapy,\" \"hydro therapies,\" \"hydro therapeutics,\" \"water therapy,\" \"aquatic exercise therapy,\" \"aquatic therapy,\" \"water-based exercise,\" \"Parkinson,\" \"Parkinson disease,\" \"Parkinson's disease,\" \"Parkinson's syndrome,\" \"primary Parkinsonism,\" \"paralysis agitans,\" and \"randomized controlled trial (RCT).\" Result: A total of 698 articles were retrieved from the four databases by searching for subject headings, and 10 RCT articles were finally included. The balance ability of aquatic exercise in patients with Parkinson's disease (weighted mean differences [WMD] = 2.234, 95% CI: 1.112-3.357, Z = 3.9, p < 0.01), walking ability (WMD = -0.911, 95% CI: -1.581 to -0.241, Z = 2.67, p < 0.01), and quality of life (WMD = -5.057, 95% CI: -9.610 to -0.504, Z = 2.18, p = 0.029) were improved, but there was no significant difference in motor function (WMD = -0.328, 95% CI: -1.781 to 1.125, Z = 0.44, p = 0.658). Conclusion: Compared with conventional rehabilitation therapy, aquatic exercise can effectively improve balance, walking ability, and quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease. However, it had no obvious effect on improving motor function. This study was limited by the number and quality of the included studies, and more high-quality studies are needed to verify this.

METHODS: Six databases were searched from inception until November 2022. Randomized clinical trials that used AEP alone, AEP combined and/or compared two types of AEP were included. The quality of evidence was assessed by the GRADE approach and the standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Twelve studies (n = 380) were included. AEP alone was superior to active control in improving body structure and function outcome: postural balance (low evidence, SMD = 0.47, p = 0.02). No statistically significant differences were found for the other body structure and function outcomes: lower limb muscle strength (p = 0.14) and depressive symptoms (p = 0.79), activity outcomes: mobility (p = 0.32) and participation outcomes: quality of life (p = 0.05). AEP combined showed no statistically significant difference for the outcomes of body structure and function: postural balance (p = 0.11) and activity: mobility (p = 0.21) when compared to active control. CONCLUSION: AEP showed positive effects on body structure and function outcome (postural balance) in individuals with PD with mild to moderate disability levels while, no significant improvements were noticed for activity and participation outcomes.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONOur findings indicate that aquatic exercise programs (AEP) lead to significant improvements on body structure and function (i.e., postural balance) in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD).The AEP evaluated in this study implemented postural balance, gait, single and double training, as well as aerobic exercises, trunk mobility exercises, and Ai Chi.The average duration, frequency, and total time implemented were 50 minutes, three times a week, for seven weeks, respectively.Considering the potential benefits identified in this study, AEP can be recommended as an adjunct treatment strategy for individuals with PD.Additionally, the use of the International Classification of Functionality, Disability and Health on the development of rehabilitation treatment plans is advised.",

Therefore, this study aimed to synthesize and systematically analyze evidence available on boosting mental health through aquatic exercise. METHOD: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted under the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. PubMed, BIOSIS Previews, PsycINFO, Medline, SPORTDiscus, Education Source, and Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) were searched in May 2022. The research included the influence of aquatic exercises on mood and anxiety symptoms. After assessing trial quality and completing data extraction, a meta-analysis was carried out through R software. The results were presented as a standardized mean difference (SMD) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: A total of 18 original trials were included. People who received aquatic exercise intervention had a statistically significant reduction in mental disorder symptoms compared with before. The results were aquatic exercise [SMD = -0.77, 95% CI (-1.08, -0.47), I2 = 77%, P < 0.01], swimming [SMD = -0.51, 95% CI (-1.14, 0.12), I2 = 78%, P < 0.01], aquatic aerobics [SMD = -0.92, 95% CI (-1.32, -0.53), I2 = 78%, P < 0.01], moderate intensity [SMD = -0.75, 95% CI (-1.07, -0.43), I2 = 67%, P < 0.01], and low intensity [SMD = -1.07, 95% CI (-1.08, -0.47), I2 = 85%, P < 0.01]. CONCLUSION: Aquatic exercise could statistically significantly improve mental health. Light aquatic aerobics probably has a better effect on mood and anxiety symptoms. However, given the number and quality of included research, verifying the aforementioned conclusions requires a larger sample of high-quality studies."

Little is known about its action on cerebral electrical activity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a water-based physical exercise protocol on electroencephalographic activity, blood glucose levels, and functional capacity, as well as their correlation, in type 2 diabetics. METHODS: Study design: Randomized Clinical Trial. Forty volunteers were randomized into two groups: control (n = 20) and study (n = 20). A water-based physical exercise program comprising 50 min sessions was conducted three times a week for five weeks. Assessments were performed at the pre- and post-intervention and follow-up phases. The qualitative data were compared using the Mann-Whitney test and Chi-Square. Quantitative data were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis, Independent t, and ANOVA mixed tests. The Spearman correlation coefficient was used to correlate the data. RESULTS: The data were similar when comparing the groups. Six-minute walk test data increased in the comparison between times (p = 0.01-PrexPos). EEG data decreased in comparison between times (prexfollow-up-p < 0.05), except AF3. EEG data decreased in the timexgroup comparison (prexfollow-up and postxfollow-up-p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The water-based exercise protocol maintained electroencephalographic activity, glucose levels, and functional capacity in people with type 2 diabetes, and there was no relationship between brain electrical activity and capillary blood glucose.",

      "abstract": "Evidence shows that physical exercise is important in maintaining an efficient immune system during ageing. However, there are few studies that test the impact of aquatic exercise programs on the immune system. This study aims to analyze the impact of different physical exercise programs in aquatic environment on the systemic hematological and inflammatory markers of community dwelling elderly. One hundred and two elderly were randomly allocated into four groups: a continuous aerobic exercise group (AerG) (n = 25, 71.44 ± 4.84 years); an interval aerobic exercise group (IntG) (n = 28, 72.64 ± 5.22 years); a combined exercise group (ComG) (n = 29, 71.90 ± 5.67 years); a control group (CG) (n = 20, 73.60 ± 5.25 years). The AerG, IntG and ComG participants took part in three different aquatic exercise programs over a 28-weeks period. The CG participants maintained their usual routines during the same time period. Blood samples were collected from all participants in order to access hematologic indicators, by means of cell count, and the inflammatory profile by ELISA. After 28 weeks, significant differences were found for several hematologic variables in the AerG, IntG and ComG with increases in mean corpuscular hemoglobulin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobulin concentration (MCHC), and hemoglobulin (Hb). Decreases in TNF-α levels were found for all exercising groups. An increase in IL-10 levels, granulocytes to lymphocytes ratio (GLR) and a decrease in the TNF-α/IL-10 ratio, were found for the IntG. For the ComG decreases were also found for the TNF-α, IL-1ß/IL-1ra ratios. The present study suggests that aquatic exercise programs were able to improve the inflammatory profile of the participants. Those in the exercise intervention groups showed a shift towards lower pro-inflammatory levels while the non-exercising group showed the opposite behaviour. The IntG and the ComG aquatic exercise programs appeared to be more effective than the AerG program in decreasing chronic low-grade inflammation by mediating the production of higher levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines. However, the differences found between the exercising groups were small and may not have clinical significance."

Before and after the intervention period, all participants underwent 20 min 12-channel high-resolution ECG recordings with off-line HRV analysis, including conventional linear time- and frequency-domain analysis (using the Welch method for fast-Fourier transformation), and preselected non-linear analysis (Poincaré plot-derived parameters, sample entropy, and the short-term scaling exponent α1 obtained by detrended fluctuation analysis). (3) Results: Eighty-nine patients completed the study (mean age 60 ± 8 years; 20 % women). We did not detect significant differences in baseline- or age-adjusted end-of-study HRV parameters, but aquatic exercise training was associated with a significant increase in the linear LF/HF parameter (from 2.6 [1.2-4.0] to 3.0 [2.1-5.5], p = 0.046) and the non-linear α1 parameter (from 1.2 [1.1-1.4] to 1.3 [1.2-1.5], p = 0.043). (4) Conclusions: Our results have shown that a short-term 14-day aquatic exercise training program improves selected HRV parameters, suggesting this mode of exercise is safe and may be beneficial in patients with CAD."

Non-pharmacological intervention with physical exercise is among the therapeutic approaches most used by health professionals. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of aquatic exercise in the treatment of inflammatory arthritis. The review was registered on the PROSPERO (CRD42020189602). The databases (PubMed, PEDro, Web of Science, and SciELO) were searched for studies involving adults with inflammatory arthritis and subjected to rehabilitation with aquatic exercise compared to any other control group, from the year 2010 to March 2022. Pain, disease activity, and physical function were regarded as primary outcomes. Two reviewers completed the eligibility screening and data extraction, and disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer. The methodological quality was assessed using the PEDro scale. A total of 5254 studies were identified, and nine articles were included, totalling 604 participants. Regarding pain, two studies showed that aquatic exercise was superior to home exercise. One study showed that disease activity was significantly improved in the aquatic group compared to the land-based exercise and the control groups (no exercise). Two studies reported that therapy containing aquatic exercise was able to improve physical function. Overall, the studies included in this review indicate that aquatic exercise is effective in treating pain, disease activity, and physical function in individuals with inflammatory arthritis. However, further studies carrying stronger evidence should be conducted to determine whether the treatment with aquatic exercise is superior to other types of therapies.",

In addition, several 'unconventional' approaches have been proposed to prevent CVD progression and complications, minimize symptoms and improve the quality of life and postoperative outcomes. Among these, balneotherapy and aquatic exercises are proving as valid and effective supporting treatments, as mentioned in a growing number of scientific publications. Moreover, aquatic protocols have been studied for both venous and lymphatic insufficiency. For these reasons, they were mentioned in the last CVD guidelines provided by the European Society for Vascular Surgery. The aim of this narrative review is to overview and summarize current literature evidences on the role and effectiveness of aquatic rehabilitative protocols in CVD, reviewing old and current literature.

However, few studies have tested its effectiveness when performed in aquatic environments. The purpose of this study was to test the impact of different aquatic exercise programs on the intima-media thickness of carotid arteries (IMT) and hemodynamic and biochemical markers of cardiovascular diseases in community-dwelling older persons. A total of 102 participants were randomly allocated into four groups: an aerobic exercise group (AerG) (n = 25, 71.44 ± 4.84 years); an aerobic interval group (IntG) (n = 28, 72.64 ± 5.22 years); a combined group (ComG) (n = 29, 71.90 ± 5.67 years); and a control group (CG) (n = 20, 73.60 ± 5.25 years). The AerG, IntG, and ComG participants took part in three different aquatic exercise programs for 28 weeks. The CG participants maintained their usual routines. All participants were evaluated for IMT, blood pressure, lipid profile, and MCP-1 and MIP-1α chemokines, pre- and post-intervention. Significant differences were found in the AerG for diastolic diameter (DD), in the IntG for peak systolic velocity (PSV), and in the ComG for DD and end-diastolic velocity (EDV). Regarding blood pressure, significant differences were found in AerG for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP); in IntG for DBP; and in ComG for SBP, DBP, and heart rate (HR). Significant differences were found in the AerG and IntG for glucose (GLU). Lower plasma levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-1α) were found in the AerG and in the ComG for MCP-1 after the intervention. Aquatic physical exercise appears to improve cardiovascular health, regardless of the type of the program adopted. Aerobic programs (combined and continuous aerobic exercises) seemed to have a more beneficial effect in reducing important cardiovascular risk markers.",

Aquatic exercise may be a suitable alternative for these individuals, preventing overheating and enabling a range of movements that were otherwise difficult on land. The objective of the current study was to understand why some persons with MS prefer aquatic exercise while others prefer non-aquatic exercise, which will inform recommendations. METHODS: A total of 179 persons with MS completed a brief online survey (∼10 min) about their exercise routines between October 2020 and April 2021. RESULTS: Fifty-sex percent of respondents reported that they only engaged in non-aquatic exercise (i.e., land-based activities such as jogging), followed by 36% of respondents who reported that they engaged in both aquatic and non-aquatic exercise, and 7% of respondents who participated in aquatic exercise only. The most frequently reported barriers for aquatic exercise were lack of access to pools and its associated expense. Among individuals who had tried aquatic exercise, aquatic exercise was preferred over non-aquatic exercise, and 100% reported that they would recommend aquatic exercise to other persons with MS. Finally, the majority of respondents reported exercising less during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. CONCLUSION: Aquatic exercise is well liked among persons with MS who have tried it; however, it may not be feasible for economically disadvantaged persons with MS. Local charities and health organizations may consider financially sponsoring aquatic exercise programs to encourage participation in physical activity for the MS population. Due to the negative impact of the pandemic on exercise routines, MS clinicians should encourage their patients to resume their exercise routines once the pandemic subsides.",

METHOD: A scoping review was performed under the PRISMA guidelines. A systematic search of Pubmed, SPORTDiscus, PsycInfo and Google Scholar databases was conducted. Studies observing the effect of aquatic exercises on mental health and related parameters were considered for inclusion. The data from the selected studies were then extracted and analysed methodically. PRIMARY CONDITIONS MEASURED: Depression, anxiety, mood, self-esteem, and psychological well-being were the primary mental states for which findings could be clearly extracted. RESULTS: Of the 1635 articles that resulted from the search, 23 articles met all inclusion criteria. Of these, 12 were randomised controlled trials. Cumulatively, the findings of this review trend towards aquatic exercise being effective in generating positive changes in mental health. CONCLUSION: Aquatic exercise, specifically winter swimming, leisure swimming, competitive swimming and aquatic aerobics, can be a promising conservative therapy for mental health management. However, it is recommended that further research be conducted to solidify these findings and establish the long-term effects of this intervention on mental health.",

UNLABELLED: Purpose The aim of this report was to assess the cardiopulmonary and metabolic impact of prescribed aquatic exercise in combination with dietary guidance for four individuals experiencing chronic SCI. CASE DESCRIPTION: We measured peak oxygen consumption (peak VO2), resting energy expenditure (REE), weight, food logs, fasting glucose, insulin and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) in four men with incomplete SCI, aged 34 to 63 years. INTERVENTION: The men received a group aquatic exercise program three times per week for 10 weeks, and a weekly individual nutritional consultation by phone. OUTCOMES: Peak VO2 increased by 7.9% and 34.4% in participants #3 and #4 and decreased by 12% and 16.4% in #1 and #2. Glucose values decreased by 19.6% and 14.2% for #1 and #3, and increased by 9.3% for both #2 and #4. Body mass decreased by 9.9%, 3.0% and 5.7% for participants #1, #2 and #3, but demonstrated no change for participant #4. Dietary guidance and education produced positive changes, including reduced fat, carbohydrate, daily sugar, and average calorie intake. CONCLUSION: Moderate exercise with weekly nutritional guidance appeared to positively impact body mass and dietary selections with varied metabolic and cardiopulmonary results.",

Both aerobic and resistance exercises produce PEH, but it is not clear if the exercise environment can lead to a higher PEH. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis investigated whether a session of aquatic exercise (AE) induces PEH in comparison with control conditions such as land exercise (LE) or rest in hypertensive subjects. METHODS: The present systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted using the following electronic databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, and EMBASE. Ambulatory blood pressure measurements made in randomized clinical trials were pooled to compare PEH induced by AE with LE and rest conditions in hypertensive subjects. RESULTS: Data from four trials were included, which comprised 127 participants (94 women and 33 men). A 24-h analysis did not detect significant differences between AE and LE or rest for either systolic blood pressure (SBP) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Monitoring during the night showed that AE induced significant PEH in comparison with LE for SBP [-8.6 (-15.0 to -1.5) mmHg (p = 0.01)]. For DBP, the AE had pronounced PEH during the night in comparison with LE [-3.7 (-4.7 to -2.8) mmHg, p = 0.000] and rest [-1.7 (-1.9 to -0.8) mmHg, p = 0.000]. There were no differences in daytime values. CONCLUSION: AE showed a higher PEH effect than LE sessions and rest conditions. PEH was observed in both SBP and DBP during the night. The number of studies was low, but all studies included in this meta-analysis used 24-h monitoring. The understanding of clinical relevance of AE, inducing a higher PEH, depends on a standardization of exercise protocols plus a rigorous monitoring of blood pressure.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Aquatic therapy is a significant intervention method for both patients and healthy individuals. However, in clinical practice, quantitative measurements are rarely applied in aquatic therapy due to the disadvantages of submerging expensive instruments in water. In this study, we used readily available smartphones and armbands to measure leg segments and joint angles during aquatic gait and evaluated the reliability of these measurements. METHODS: Waterproof smartphones were strapped to the trunk, thighs, and shanks of 19 healthy young adults using armbands. The angles of the trunk, thigh, and shank segments were measured during aquatic gait. The measurements were repeated 1 day later. The data were analyzed to obtain the angles of the hip and knee joints. RESULTS: Measurement repeatability, calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), was the highest for the shank segment range of motion (ROM) (first 46.79° ± 5.50°, second 50.12° ± 9.98°, ICC = 0.78). There was high agreement in trunk segment ROM (first 6.36° ± 1.42°, second 4.29° ± 1.83°, ICC = 0.73), thigh segment ROM (first 33.49° ± 5.18°, second 37.31° ± 8.70°, ICC = 0.62), and knee joint ROM (first 52.43° ± 11.26°, second 62.19° ± 16.65°, ICC = 0.68) and fair agreement in hip joint ROM (first 34.60°±4.71°, second 37.80° ± 7.84°, ICC = 0.59). CONCLUSIONS: Smartphones can be used to reliably measure leg segments and joint angles during aquatic gait, providing a simpler method for obtaining these measurements and enabling the wider use of aquatic motion analysis in clinical practice and research."

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Therapeutic aquatic exercise is frequently offered to patients with chronic low back pain, but its long-term benefits are unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term effects of therapeutic aquatic exercise on people with chronic low back pain. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 3-month, single-blind randomized clinical trial with a 12-month follow-up period was performed from September 10, 2018, to March 12, 2019, and the trial follow-up was completed March 17, 2020. A total of 113 people with chronic low back pain were included in the experiment. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to either the therapeutic aquatic exercise or the physical therapy modalities group. The therapeutic aquatic exercise group received aquatic exercise, whereas the physical therapy modalities group received transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and infrared ray thermal therapy. Both interventions were performed for 60 minutes twice a week for 3 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was disability level, which was measured using the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire; scores range from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating more severe disability. Secondary outcomes included pain intensity, quality of life, sleep quality, recommendation of intervention, and minimal clinically important difference. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of the 113 participants, 59 were women (52.2%) (mean [SD] age, 31.0 [11.5] years). Participants were randomly allocated into the therapeutic aquatic exercise group (n = 56) or the physical therapy modalities group (n = 57), and 98 patients (86.7%) completed the 12-month follow-up. Compared with the physical therapy modalities group, the therapeutic aquatic exercise group showed greater alleviation of disability, with adjusted mean group differences of -1.77 (95% CI, -3.02 to -0.51; P = .006) after the 3-month intervention, -2.42 (95% CI, -4.13 to -0.70; P = .006) at the 6-month follow-up, and -3.61 (95% CI, -5.63 to -1.58; P = .001) at the 12-month follow-up (P < .001 for overall group × time interaction). At the 12-month follow-up point, improvements were significantly greater in the therapeutic aquatic exercise group vs the physical therapy modalities group in the number of participants who met the minimal clinically important difference in pain (at least a 2-point improvement on the numeric rating scale) (most severe pain, 30 [53.57%] vs 12 [21.05%]; average pain, 14 [25%] vs 11 [19.30%]; and current pain, 22 [39.29%] vs 10 [17.54%]) and disability (at least a 5-point improvement on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire) (26 [46.43%] vs 4 [7.02%]). One of the 56 participants (1.8%) in the therapeutic aquatic exercise group vs 2 of the 57 participants (3.5%) in the physical therapy modalities group experienced low back pain and other pains related to the intervention. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The therapeutic aquatic exercise program led to greater alleviation in patients with chronic low back pain than physical therapy modalities and had a long-term effect up to 12 months. This finding may prompt clinicians to recommend therapeutic aquatic exercise to patients with chronic low back pain as part of treatment to improve their health through active exercise rather than relying on passive relaxation.

The main outcomes were 6‑min walking distance (6MWD) and maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). Secondary outcomes were resting heart rate (RHR) and resting systolic (RSBP) and diastolic blood pressures (RDBP).Results    12 articles including 320 participants were identified. Among them, three trials compared AE to land-based exercise (LE), six compared AE to non-intervention control (Ctrl), and three were pre- / post-AE design without a control group. Meta-analysis showed that compared with baseline, VO2max increased (WMD=0.71, 95 %CI 0.47 to 0.94), while RHR, RSBP and RDBP declined (WMD=-5.88, 95 %CI -6.88 to -4.88; WMD=-5.76, 95 %CI -7.75 to -3.78; WMD= -2.48, 95 %CI -3.83 to -1.13, respectively) post-AE. 6WMD and VO2max increased (WMD=127.00, 95 %CI 49.26 to 204.74; WMD=2.02, 95 %CI 1.66 to 2.38, respectively) and RHR declined (WMD=-4.20, 95 %CI -6.36 to -2.03, AE vs Ctrl) when AE was compared to Ctrl. There were no significant differences in the above indicators between AE and LE.Conclusions    AE, like LE, increases VO2max, and reduces RHR, RSBP, and RDBP. These responses may improve cardiovascular health in patients with T2DM. However, more data are needed to confirm the effect of AE on 6MWD in T2DM patients.",

Some of the major physical exercise program disadvantages on land are minimized due to the specific properties of the aquatic environment. The purpose of the present randomized controlled study is to verify the effects of different aquatic physical exercise programs on body composition, functional fitness and cognitive function in non-institutionalized elderly people. For this study, 102 elderly individuals were randomly allocated into four different groups: AerG (n = 25, 71.44 ± 4.84 years); IntG (n = 28, 72.64 ± 5.22 years); ComG (n = 29, 71.90 ± 5.67 years) and CG (n = 20, 73.60 ± 5.25 years). Individuals from the groups AerG, IntG and ComG participated in three different aquatic physical exercise programs for a period of 28 weeks. The CG participants kept to their usual routines. All participants were evaluated for body composition, functional fitness and cognitive function at two time moments, i.e., pre- (M1) and post-intervention (M2). Significant differences for body composition were found between M1 and M2 for FM (p < 0.001), LBM (p < 0.001) and WCir (p < 0.01) in the AerG, for BMI (p < 0.05), FM (p < 0.05), LBM (p < 0.001) and LCir-R (p < 0.05) in the IntG, and for WGT (p < 0.01), FM (p < 0.05), LBM (p < 0.01), LCir-R (p < 0.05) and LCir-L (p < 0.01) in the ComG groups. For functional fitness, differences were found between M1 and M2 for 2m-ST (p < 0.000), 30s-CS (p < 0.000), 30s-AC (p < 0.05), HG-T-R (p < 0.000) and HG-T-L (p < 0.000) in the AerG, for 2m-ST (p < 0.05), BS-R (p < 0.05), 30s-CS (p < 0.000), 30s-AC(p < 0.01), HG-T-R (p < 0.000) and HG-T-L (p < 0.000) in the IntG, and for 30s-CS (p < 0.000), HG-T-R (p < 0.000) and HG-T-L (p < 0.000) in the ComG groups. The present study evidenced the beneficial effects of physical exercise in an aquatic environment on body composition, functional fitness and cognitive function in non-institutionalized elderly adults. The ComG water-based exercise program showed more beneficial effects in the improvement of body composition and cognitive function variables, while the IntG and AerG programs were more effective in the improvement of functional fitness.",

The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of a 6-week aquatic exercise program on sleep efficiency among adults with chronic MSK pain. METHODS: A total of 30 adults with chronic MSK pain were recruited by convenience sampling and assigned into intervention and control groups by a trained research assistant. Their sleep efficiency, sleep quality, activity level, stress level, and pain level were measured with ActiGraph GT3X accelerometer before and after the intervention group completed a 6-week, biweekly program of aquatic exercise. RESULTS: Following intervention, the intervention group had significantly longer total true sleep time (by 27.6 min, P = .006); greater sleep efficiency (+3.01%, P = .005); and less pain (-1.33/10, P = .026). The control group had significantly shorter total true sleep time by 5.8 minutes (P = .036) while changes in the other outcomes were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Six weeks of moderate-intensity aquatic exercise may improve sleep efficiency and reduce pain for persons suffering chronic MSK pain.",

METHODS: Forty-four female Wistar rats were randomly divided into four experimental groups: Lesion control (L), Lesion and FS (LS), Lesion and AE (LE) and Lesion and FS associated to AE (LSE). The edema volume (EV), collagen ratio, and histopathological analysis were evaluated after 7, 14, and 21 days of partial tendon transection. RESULTS: The EV was statistically reduced for all treatment groups after 7 and 21 days when compared to L group. The LS and LSE had the highest EV reduction after 21 days of treatment. The FS group didn't induce tissue necrosis or infections on the histopathological analysis. It was observed tenocytes proliferation, granulation tissue and collagen formation in the tendon partial transection area in the FS group. The LSE demonstrated higher amount of granulation tissue and increased the collagen deposition at the injury site. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that the therapeutic potential of the association of heterologous fibrin biopolymer sealant with aquatic exercise program should be further explored as it may stimulate the regeneration phase and optimize calcaneal tendon recovery.",

Objective: To identify and critically analyze the best available evidence concerning the effects of AE in the physical and mental health of people with ID. Methods: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and comparative studies was performed after searching within several databases up to March 2021. Results: A total of 4 RCTs and 3 comparative studies were found. Their methodological quality ranged from high to low. Aquatic interventions had positive effects on cardiorespiratory, muscular fitness and balance. Mixed effects were seen on parameters related to obesity and cognition. Scant information regarding feasibility and intervention fidelity was provided. In general, interventions details were not discussed in deep. Conclusion: Preliminary evidence shows that aquatic exercise can be prescribed to people with ID in order to improve their physical health. The impact of aquatic exercise on motor skills, cognitive function and mental health remains unclear. Further research on this topic should provide a detailed description of the interventions carried out, including information on the feasibility and intervention fidelity."

Importantly, the imbalance of oxidative stress is related to PD physiopathology and progression. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of grape juice consumption associated with an aquatic exercise protocol on oxidative stress parameters and cognitive function in individuals with PD. The participants were randomized into two groups: grape juice group (GJG) and control group (CG) and were submitted to 4 weeks of an aquatic intervention (twice a week, approximately 60 minutes/session). The GJG also consumed 400 ml of grape juice per day (integral and conventional) during this period. Cognitive function was assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCa) questionnaire. For the analysis of oxidative stress markers, specifically lipid oxidative damage (TBARS), proteins (Carbonil), acid uric and the activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase), blood collection were done before and after intervention. No changes were observed in cognitive function after intervention in both groups. Regarding biomarkers, a reduction of antioxidant enzymes, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and uric acid was observed in both groups. However, only the GJG showed a significant reduction on protein oxidation levels after intervention. In conclusion, the consumption of grape juice associated with an aquatic exercise protocol might be consider an effective alternative to reduce the oxidative damage in PD, reinforcing the importance of this intervention in promoting beneficial impact in this population."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Recurrent joint bleeds in haemophilia patients often cause musculoskeletal changes leading to functional capacity impairment. AIM: In this study, we assessed the effects of aquatic activities performed to improve functional capacity in these patients. METHODS: The interventional protocol consisted of 24 hydrotherapy sessions during three months, in comparison with 24 swimming sessions. The pre- and post-intervention assessment consisted of Functional Independence Score, haemophilia joint health score (HJHS), Pediatric Haemophilia Activities List (PedHAL), surface electromyography (SEMG) of thigh muscles to assess muscle electric activity, and load cell on extensor and flexor thigh muscles to evaluate muscular strength. RESULTS: Forty-seven haemophilia patients were enrolled in this study, and 32 (23 severe haemophilia A, one moderate haemophilia A and 8 severe haemophilia B), median age 12y (6 to 40y), concluded the aquatic intervention. We observed a statistically significant increase with substantial improvement in functional capacity in the pre- and post-intervention evaluation of hydrotherapy in comparison with the swimming protocol, with HJHS (p = .006 and p = .001 respectively), PedHAL (Sum score) (p = .022 and p = .001) and score FISH (p = .021). The swimming group revealed significant improvements in muscular strength, in all muscles tested (p = .005 and p = .001). SEMG signal amplitude reached significantly higher levels in all muscles evaluated after both interventions except for the vastus medialis (right) in the hydrotherapy group. CONCLUSION: Our results concluded that both swimming and hydrotherapy were associated with physical improvement in haemophilia patients; however, only hydrotherapy lead to a more significant improvement in functional capacity.",

METHODS: This randomized controlled trial included 120 older adults assigned to aquatic exercises (AG; n = 60; 70.62 ± 6.04 years) and a control group (CG; n = 60; 71.86 ± 6.95 years). The risk of falls, perceptual aspects (fall risk awareness and pain), functional capacity (lower and upper body strength, lower and upper body flexibility, functional mobility, and balance) and QoL were assessed at baseline and after the experimental protocol. The AG performed 16 weeks of aquatic exercises (twice per week, 45 min.session-1) with lower and upper body strength, stretching, and balance exercises. Exercise intensity was controlled using the rate of perceived exertion (12-16 on the Borg scale [6-20 points]) and heart rate (progressing from 40% to 60% of the heart-rate reserve). RESULTS: The training program improved the lower (mean difference [95% CI]: 2.7 [2.0 to 3.3]) and upper body strength (3.5 [2.6 to 4.5]), lower (4.6 [3.4 to 5.8]) and upper body flexibility (6.5 [4.3 to 8.6]), functional mobility (-2.5 [-2.9 to -1.9]), and balance (11.2 [10.6 to 11.9]); reduced pain perception (-3.2 [-3.7 to -2.8]); increased the fall risk awareness (9.5 [8.8 to 10.1]) and QoL perception (5.6 to 22.6 [4.6 to 25.1]). CONCLUSIONS: The water-based program may be used as a preventive approach for the older adults with MSDs and at risk of falling to improve physical and usual perceptual aspects (QoL and pain) and fall risk awareness.",

This study aimed to compare the effects of aerobic and combined aquatic training on cardiorespiratory outcomes in patients with T2D. METHODS: Untrained patients with T2D were randomized to receive an aerobic aquatic training, a combined aquatic training, or a procedure control in 3 weekly sessions for 15 weeks. The sessions were 50 minutes long. The intensities were from 85% to 100% of heart rate of anaerobic threshold and at maximal velocity for aerobic and resistance parts, respectively. Resting heart rate, peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), and oxygen uptake corresponding to second ventilatory threshold and its relation with VO2peak were evaluated. RESULTS: Participants were 59.0 (8.2) years old and 51% women. Intervention groups increased in VO2peak (aerobic aquatic training group: 4.48 mL·kg-1·min-1, P = .004; combined aquatic training group: 5.27 mL·kg-1·min-1; P = .006) and oxygen uptake corresponding to second ventilatory threshold, whereas the control group presented an increase in oxygen uptake corresponding to second ventilatory threshold and minimal change in VO2peak.

We aimed to evaluate respiratory changes and functional outcomes in children attending an aquatic therapy program. Eleven patients diagnosed with NMD (4-18 years, Vignos scale 1-9) were involved in a 10-week aquatic exercise program. The ventilation variables were: peak cough flow, volumes (forced expiratory volume in one second-FEV1 and inspiratory volume) and respiratory pressures to evaluate strength and oxygen saturation (O2 sat). Functional skills were measured in the aquatic environment (Water Orientation Test Alyn 1) and on dry land, (Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory), together with quality of life (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory). Our evaluation included several 2 × 6 mixed-model repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with time (baseline, post 1 session, pre-post at five weeks and pre-post at 10 weeks). Important improvements in functional skills were observed in and out of the water and children under the age of 11 displayed a significant difference for inspirational volume (p = 0.002) and O2 sat (p = 0.029). Clinical, statistically insignificant changes were found for peak cough flow and expiratory pressures values after aquatic exercise. These results may support a relationship between aquatic exercise in NMD, respiratory outcomes and functional activities in water and on land."

Oxidative stress, i.e., the imbalance between the generation of reactive oxygen species and the antioxidant defense capacity of the body, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Physical exercise can regulate oxidative stress. The purpose of this study was to analyze the short- and long-term effects of an aquatic exercise program on oxidative stress levels in patients with Parkinson's disease. The aquatic exercise program was carried out during 1 month with two sessions per week (1 hour/session). Blood samples were collected at four different time points: pre-intervention, immediately, 48 hours, and 30 days after the first session of aquatic exercise program. Our results revealed that water-based programs modulated antioxidant enzyme activity, increased superoxide dismutase activity, reduced catalase activity, and increased the ratio of superoxide dismutase activity to catalase activity in patients with Parkinson's disease. Compared with pre-intervention and 48 hours after the first session of aquatic exercise program, superoxide dismutase activity was higher and catalase activity was lower immediately and 30 days after the first session. Our results demonstrated that aquatic exercise program could modulate oxidative stress, mainly by the effect of antioxidant enzyme activity. These results could better help understand the target of oxidative stress in Parkinson's disease.

METHODS: 40 women post breast cancer divided into two groups: a study group (n = 20) participated in the aquatic exercises and a control group (n = 20) performed the land exercises. Data collection occurred both before and after the 8 week intervention. Measurements were taken from the SG and CG performing antagonistic movements (flexions/extensions) to assess the endurance (120 °/s) in isokinetic conditions and a photogrammetric examination to define sagittal spinal curvatures. RESULTS: A significant improvement (p < 0.05) in total work and average power was found among women after the aquatic exercises irrespective of the muscle group under examination. There were no significant changes in any examined parameters after the land exercises. In the study group, there was a significant association of gamma angle decrease and an increase of all examined functional parameters of total work and average power of both the extensor muscles (r = -0,49 to -0.51) and the trunk flexors (r = -0.48 to -0.51). In the control group, a similar tendency of functional-postural changes was observed only for the extensor muscles of the trunk (r = -0.54 to -0.58).

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Outpatient clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six women with chronic nonspecific LBP (mean [SD]: age = 50.69 [4.187] y) participated. INTERVENTIONS: Participants randomly assigned to AE (n = 12), KT (n = 12), and nontreatment control (n = 12) groups for 6 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain intensity and functional disability were evaluated at baseline and the end of the intervention. RESULTS: Pain intensity decreased more in the AE group than in the KT group (5.9-0.5 cm [91.6% decrease] vs 5.7-2.4 cm [58.1% decrease], respectively; P < .001 for both after Bonferroni post hoc test); the values decreased more in the 2 treatment groups than in the control group (P < .001 for between-group comparisons). Disability decreased more in the AE group (43.2%-18.8% [55.6% decrease]) than the KT group (37.8%-19.3% [48.3% decrease]) (P < .001 for both comparisons), but increased in the control group (38.7%-41.2% [6.5% increase]; P = .045). CONCLUSION: These results suggest AE and KT treatment methods provide pain intensity and disability improvements in women with chronic nonspecific LBP. Nevertheless, AE was more effective than KT."

While obese LBP people cannot avoid weight load on the spine in any exercise, they can easily carry out exercise in water. This study aimed to investigate the effect of aquatic exercise on LBP disability among obese women. In this study, a total of 39 women with body mass index (BMI)≥27 kg/m2 who suffering from nonspecific chronic LBP were purposively selected. They randomly assigned in two groups; aquatic and control. The aquatic group carried out aquatic exercise, twice per week, 60 min per session, for 12 weeks. LBP disability was measured using modified Oswestry questionnaire with ten sections; pain intensity, personal care, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, social life, traveling, and employment. Results showed no significant difference in age, weight, BMI, waist to hip ratio, and percentage of body fat in both groups. An analyzing of multivariate analysis of covariance revealed that there was significant improvement on pain intensity, personal care, sitting, standing, sleeping, employment and total disability score in aquatic group, while there was no significant difference in lifting, walking, social life, and traveling abilities after 12 weeks between the groups. As a conclusion, this progressive aquatic exercise was a convenience and effective intervention program to reduce pain intensity, and improve personal care, sitting, standing, sleeping, and employment abilities in obese LBP women."

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress and inflammation are key pathways responsible for the pathogenesis of asthma. Aquatic exercise (AE) has been proven to elicit a variety of biological activities such as anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. However, although proper forms of AE provide beneficial health effects, incorrect forms and types of AE are potentially injurious to health. Several studies have investigated AE, but the relationship between types of AE and asthma has not been fully elucidated. This study evaluated the effects of two types of AE according to resistance on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic airway inflammation in mice. BALB/c mice were subjected to OVA sensitization and challenge, and then to different types of AE including, walking and swimming, in a pool filled with water to a height of 2.5 and 13 cm for 30 min, respectively. AE reduced OVA-induced eosinophilic inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and serum immunoglobulin E level. AE significantly inhibited increases in interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13, histamine, leukotriene D4, and tryptase levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). AE also effectively suppressed mucus formation, lung fibrosis, and hypertrophy of airway smooth muscle within the lung tissues. This exercise markedly reduced the levels of malondialdehyde while increased glutathione and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in lung tissues. Furthermore, AE significantly decreased tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6 levels, and prostaglandin E2 production in BALF. The inhibitory effects of swimming on the levels of biomarkers related to oxidative stress and inflammation were greater than that of walking. These effects may have occurred through upregulation of NF-E2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 signaling and suppression of mitogen-activated protein kinase/nuclear factor-κB pathway. Cumulative results from this study suggest that AE might be beneficial in mitigating the levels of biomarkers related to oxidative stress and inflammation. Thus, this therapy represents a crucial non-pharmacological intervention for treatments of allergic airway inflammation."

METHODS: We performed a randomized controlled trial at a university hospital. Overall, 32 men with knee osteoarthritis, aged ≥ 60 years, were included. Pain, balance, and gait were evaluated before and 2 months after interventions. The group control used acetaminophen and followed lifestyle recommendations. The intervention group performed the aquatic exercise three sessions per week for 8 weeks. RESULTS: At the end of the study, mean pain scores were significantly different between the groups (p = 0.010). Within-group analyses showed that group intervention experienced significant pain relief (p = 0.019), whereas group control did not show the significant change (p = 0.493). There was significant improvement in favor of aquatic exercise with regard to static (p = 0.001) and dynamic (p = 0.001) balance, step length (p = 0.038), stride length (p < 0.001), and cadence (p < 0.001). However, we did not find a significant difference in step time and width between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Aquatic exercise would be beneficial in decreasing subjective pain of osteoarthritis. There are some recognizable improvements in patients' gait and balance as well."

Properly structured exercises on land have been reported to be effective in improving functional performance in children with CP while only few have been documented on aquatic therapy. Objective. To investigate the effect of a 10-week aquatic exercise training program on gross motor function in children with spastic CP. Methods. Thirty participants aged 1 to 12 years were randomized into the experimental and control groups. Both groups received manual passive stretching and functional training exercises, depending on their level of motor impairment, either in water (temperature 28°C to 32°C) or on land. Each exercise training session lasted for about 1 hour 40 minutes, twice per week for 10 weeks in both groups. Measurement of gross motor function was done using Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-88) at baseline and after 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 10 weeks of intervention. Both groups were compared for differences in change in gross motor function using Mann-Whitney U test. The level of significance was set at P < .05. Results. Only the experimental group showed significant improvement (P < .05) in all dimensions of gross motor function except for walking, running, and jumping (P = .112). Statistically significant difference (P < .05) was found between both groups for all dimensions of gross motor function after 10 weeks of intervention. Conclusion. Aquatic exercise training program is effective in the functional rehabilitation of children with spastic CP."

Group exercise could mitigate fall risk but the traditional land-based group exercise may not be always suitable for older adults at risk of falling, especially for those with musculoskeletal problems. Ai Chi aquatic exercise program could provide a safe and low-impact exercise training for older adults. However, the feasibility and efficacy of the program has not been well-investigated. The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of the Ai Chi aquatic exercise program, compared to the land-based exercise program for older adults with moderate to high risk of falling. Forty community-dwelling older adults aged 65 or above with moderate to high fall risk will be recruited. They will be randomly allocated in the Ai Chi Aquatic Exercise Group (intervention) or the Land-based Exercise Group (active control) receiving 16 sessions (8 weeks) of specific exercise training. Feasibility of both exercise groups will be examined by recruitment, adherence, retention, feedback, subjective exercise experiences and satisfaction. Preliminary efficacy will be determined by whether physical and psychological fall risk factors could be mitigated. Physical fall risk assessment will include tests for flexibility, muscle strength, gait and balance. Psychological fall risk will be evaluated by preliminary cognitive function, anxiety level, level of depression and fear of falling. The results could establish a solid foundation for worldwide development of a feasible, safe and effective Ai Chi aquatic exercise program for prevention of falls in older adults with risk of falling."

However, the effect of head-out aquatic exercise on arterial stiffness, a strong future cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, remains unclear. We determined whether head-out aquatic exercise would mitigate arterial stiffness in middle-aged and elderly people. In 25 middle-aged and older people (9 men, mean age 64 ± 8 years), blood pressure (BP) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) were measured before and after a supervised aquatic exercise training program (60 min, 1 session/week, 14 sessions) which mainly consisted of walking, stretching, and muscle strengthening in water. In the pooled subjects, systolic BP tended to decrease (p = 0.07) after the training intervention, whereas no significant changes were observed, including baPWV (from 1,537 ± 301 to 1,496 ± 308 cm/s). In the sub-analysis, by dividing subjects into a healthy group (n = 13) and a CVD risk group (n = 12), no significant interaction between time and group was seen in BP. On the other hand, baPWV decreased significantly in the healthy group (from 1,476 ± 299 to 1,365 ± 215 cm/s) but not in the CVD risk group (from 1,603 ± 301 to 1,637 ± 339 cm/s). The current study demonstrates that regular head-out aquatic exercise, even at a low frequency, could mitigate CVD risk in apparently healthy middle-aged and older people."

Does aquatic exercise have greater effects on these outcomes than other forms of exercise in people with PD? DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. PARTICIPANTS: People with idiopathic PD. INTERVENTION: Supervised aquatic exercise programs ≥ 2 weeks. OUTCOMES MEASURES: The primary outcomes were disease severity, motor impairments, activity performance, and fear of falling. The secondary outcomes were non-motor impairments and quality of life. RESULTS: Of the 129 identified records, seven trials met the inclusion criteria and six were meta-analysed (159 participants). One trial assessed the effect of aquatic exercise compared with control and found a significant improvement in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III (MD -4.6, 95% CI -7.5 to -1.7) in favour of aquatic exercise. Six studies compared aquatic exercise with land-based exercise after intervention (mean 7.2 weeks of training (SD 2.2); 159 participants). The effect of aquatic exercise was superior to land-based exercise on the Berg Balance Scale (MD 2.7, 95% CI 1.6 to 3.9), the Falls Efficacy Scale (MD -4.0, 95% CI -6.1 to -1.8) and the 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (MD -6.0, 95% CI -11.3 to -0.6), with no other significant effects identified. The significant benefit on the Berg Balance Scale was maintained at the follow-up assessment (MD 6.3, 95% CI 2.1 to 10.5, 54 participants). CONCLUSION: Aquatic exercise improves motor impairments in people with PD significantly more than no intervention. It also has slightly to moderately greater benefits than land-based exercise on balance capacity, fear of falling, and health-related quality of life. On other outcomes, the benefits of aquatic exercise are similar to those of land-based exercise. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42017077370.",

Age-related changes in strength, balance and flexibility are degenerative factors that may increase the risk of falling, and an aquatic training may offer a favourable environment to improve these modifiable risk factors. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to assess the potential preventative role of aquatic exercise for reducing the risk of falls in the elderly by improving predisposing risk factors. Electronic databases and reference lists of pertinent articles published between 2005 and 2018 were searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that directly or indirectly addressed the effect of aquatic exercise for the prevention of falls in healthy participants were included within the synthesis. Studies were included if they were reported between January 2005 and May 2018 within a population aged between 60 and 90 years old that were without exercise-effecting comorbidities. Data related to participant demographics, study design, methodology, interventions and outcomes was extracted by one reviewer. Methodological quality assessment was independently performed by two reviewers using the PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) scale. RESULTS: Fourteen trials met the inclusion criteria. Exercise intervention duration and frequency varied from 2 to 24 weeks, from 2 to 3 times per week, from 40 to 90 min per session. Fall rate was not reported in any of the studies analysed. However, aquatic exercise improved key predisposing physical fitness components that are modifiable and internal risk factors for falling. CONCLUSIONS: There is limited, low-quality evidence to support the use of aquatic exercise for improving physiological components that are risk factors for falling. Although the evidence is limited, and many interventions are not well described, these results should be considered by health and exercise professionals when making evidence-based, clinical decisions regarding training programmes to reduce the risk of falling.",

The meta-analysis showed that there was no significant difference between AQE and LBE for pain relief, physical function, and improvement in the quality of life, for both short- and long-term interventions, in patients with knee OA. However, the adherence and satisfaction level for AQE was higher than for LBE. Compared to no intervention, AQE showed a mild effect for elevating activities of daily living (standardized mean difference [SMD]: -0.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-0.94, -0.16], P = .005) and a high effect for improving sports and recreational activities (SMD: -1.03, 95% CI [-1.82, -0.25], P = .01). CONCLUSION: AQE is comparable to LBE for treating knee OA.",

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of two different aquatic exercise trainings on cardiopulmonary endurance and emotional status in patients with knee osteoarthritis. METHODS: Eighty-nine patients who had been diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis were divided into three groups as two different aquatic exercise training groups (only lower extremity training vs. lower extremity + upper extremity and trunk exercises) or the control group. All groups have received the conventional therapy which consisted of hotpack, ultrasound, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and home exercises. Six-minute walk test (6MWT) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) were used for assessing cardiopulmonary endurance and emotional status, respectively. RESULTS: Following the treatment, all groups improved in terms of systolic blood pressure, walking distance and total HAD scores. Group 1 showed additional improvements in diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and perceived exertion, while Group 2 showed additional improvements only in perceived exertion. Greater changes before and after the treatment in diastolic blood pressure at rest and following 6MWT, perceived exertion following 6MWT, walking distance, HAD depression scores and HAD anxiety scores were observed in Group 1. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise therapy consisting of only lower extremity exercises in water might be more effective in improving exercise capacity and depression levels in comparison to upper extremity and trunk added exercises or conventional physical therapy.",

OBJECTIVES: Investigate the effects of head-out AE interventions on the physiological and psychological outcomes of healthy postmenopausal women of age 50-70 years. SEARCH STRATEGIES: Databases searched included Scopus, ScienceDirect, ResearchGate, PubMed/MEDLINE, PEDro, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, Nursing & Allied Health Collection: Comprehensive, JSTOR, and OTSeeker.com, through January 2015. Search Criteria: Randomized controlled trial and quasi-randomized controlled trial studies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two researchers scanned studies based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies included were critically appraised using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale (PEDro scale). RESULTS: A total of 15 studies including postmenopausal women and head-out AE intervention were reviewed. Considerable variation existed in the interventions and assessments. Outcome measures showed anthropometric measures (body mass index, circumference, skinfolds, and body fat) were inconclusive; upper and lower body strength improved; flexibility improved; all functional movements (short-distance walk, long-distance walk/run, power, agility, balance and falls) improved; bone density improved; biochemical and hormonal variables were inconclusive; and quality of life outcomes improved. CONCLUSIONS: Head-out AE appears to be an effective training and conditioning method for postmenopausal women to improve strength, flexibility, functional movements, bone density, and quality of life."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether patients with lower limb lymphedema (LLL) can benefit from water immersion exercise training to improve functional capacity, quality of life (QOL), and help control/diminish limb volume. DESIGN: A before-after trial. SETTING: A community University Sports Center. SUBJECTS: Eleven participants were recruited to participate and four declined to pursue the study for personal reasons. A convenient sample of seven female affected by either bilateral or unilateral LLL volunteered for this pilot study. Patients had primary or secondary lymphedema as complications of melanoma or gynecologic cancers. INTERVENTIONS: An aquatic training exercise intervention of moderate to vigorous intensity was conducted for a 6-week period (12 sessions of 45 min). This innovative circuit training program consisted of yoga exercises, aqua-jogging, pedaling on a water bike, and muscular training on an aquastep and a trampoline. OUTCOME MEASURES: The physical characteristics of water could be used to overcome the physical and medical limitations encountered on dry land for patients with LLL to exercise and reach training benefits. Outcome measures were the 6-min walk test (6MWT), handgrip strength test, QOL for limb lymphedema questionnaire (LYMQOL), bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy, and limb circumference. RESULTS: The distance covered in the 6MWT and the handgrip strength were significantly improved. A trend toward an increase in the overall QOL score was noticeable, whereas a significantly improved emotions score was observed with the LYMQOL questionnaire. Limb circumferential volume was significantly lower and impedance was increased, denoting a decrease in lymphatic fluid. CONCLUSIONS: Innovative aquatic exercise training program allows moderate and vigorous intensity activities for patients with LLL, increases functional capacity and QOL. Thus, immersion exercise does not appear to exacerbate LLL and a randomized clinical trial with larger numbers is essential to consolidate the results of this study.",

METHODS: Eleven women (54.8 ± 12.4 year) volunteered for the 5-week program; an initial 20-min aquatic exercise session then two self-paced 20-min sessions per week for 4 weeks. Pre- and post-intervention outcomes were physiological measures, 6 min Walk Test (6MWT), perceived exertion (RPE), hand grip strength, Sit-to-Stand, Sit-Reach test, Apley's shoulder test, FACIT questionnaire, and 24-h post-test tiredness and pain scores (0-10 visual analogue scale). Heart rates, RPE, 24- and 48-h post-session tiredness/pain scores were recorded each session. RESULTS: 6MWT distance increased by 60.8 m (p = 0.006), left hand grip strength by 6 kg (p = 0.038), Sit-Reach test by 4.0 cm (p = 0.017), right shoulder flexibility by 2.9 cm (p = 0.026), FACIT scores by 8.2 (p = 0.041); 24-h post-test tiredness and pain decreased by 1.5 and 1.6, respectively (p = 0.002). There were significant post-intervention increases in exercising heart rates (6MWT 4- and 6-min time points), oxygen saturation at 2-min, and reduced RPE at 4-min. Weekly resting and exercising heart rates increased significantly during the study but RPE decreased; immediately post- and 24-h post-session tiredness decreased significantly. There were no reports of symptom exacerbation. CONCLUSIONS: Five weeks of low-moderate intensity aquatic exercise significantly improved exercise capacity, RPE and fatigue. This exercise mode exercise may potentially be a manageable and safe physical activity for CFS/ME patients.",

We randomly assigned 25 women (65 ± 7 years) into two groups: Training group (T, n = 15) and Untrained group (Un, n = 10). The T group was submitted to 24 weeks of HIIAE program, where each session lasted for 30 minutes. The following parameters were assessed before and 6 months following the intervention: bone and physical fitness; lumbar spine (LS), total femur (TF), and whole body (WB) bone mineral density (BMD); agility (time up-and-go, TUG); and leg strength (chair stand test, CS). We observed a significant increase (p < 0.01) in LS, (Un: -0.88 ± 3.55, T: 3.71 ± 3.68; %), TF (Un: -1.38 ± 17.76, T: 6.52 ± 2.71; %), and WB (Un: 2.09 ± 3.17, T: 3.23 ± 4.18) BMD in the T group.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of aquatic exercise on mental health, functional autonomy, and oxidative dysfunction in hypertensive adults. Methodologically 29 adults (mean age 53 ± 7.5 years) were included in the study, and were randomly grouped as hypertensive (n = 16) and non-hypertensive (n = 13). Both groups underwent low-intensity aquatic exercise program for 12 weeks. Outcomes were evaluated at week 0 and 12. The values for the following parameters decreased in the hypertensive group post training: anxiety (-6.2 ± 2 score; 60%), Timed Up and Go test (-7.4 ± 0.3 sec; 30%), protein carbonylation (-0.15 ± 0.03 nmol/mg protein; 50%), nitric oxide (12.4 ± 6 nmol/mg protein; 62%), interleukin-6 (-27.6 ± 5.7 pg/mg protein; 46%), and tissue necrosis factor-alpha (-52.4 ± 3.8 pg/mg protein; 40%); however, the values of the following parameters increased before training: Berg score (56 ± 2; 7.8%), flexibility (27 ± 1 cm; 71%); glutathione (3.1 ± 1.3 nmol/mg protein; 138%), and superoxide dismutase (1.6 ± 0.4 nmol/mg; 166%).

The aim of this study is to review the current evidence and evaluate the role of exercise either on land or in water for the management of patients with AS in the biological era. Systematic review of the literature published until November 2016 in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Scopus databases. Thirty-five studies were included for further analysis (30 concerning land exercise and 5 concerning water exercise; combined or not with biological drugs), comprising a total of 2515 patients. Most studies showed a positive effect of exercise on Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index, pain, mobility, function and quality of life. The benefit was statistically significant in randomized controlled trials. Results support a multimodal approach, including educational sessions and maintaining home-based program. This study highlights the important role of exercise in management of AS, therefore it should be encouraged and individually prescribed. More studies with good methodological quality are needed to strengthen the results and to define the specific characteristics of exercise programs that determine better results.",

The purpose of this study was to perform a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of regular aquatic exercise on blood pressure. Design A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Methods Databases were searched for literature published up to April 2017. The randomized controlled trials analysed involved healthy adults, an intervention group that only performed aquatic exercise and a control group that did not exercise, no other intervention, and trials indicated mean systolic blood pressure or diastolic blood pressure. The net change in blood pressure was calculated from each trial, and the changes in blood pressure were pooled by a random effects model, and the risk of heterogeneity was evaluated. Subgroup analysis of subjects with hypertension, subjects who performed endurance exercise (or not), and subjects who only swam (or not) was performed, and the net changes in blood pressure were pooled. Results The meta-analysis examined 14 trials involving 452 subjects. Pooled net changes in blood pressure improved significantly (systolic blood pressure -8.4 mmHg; diastolic blood pressure -3.3 mmHg) and the changes in systolic blood pressure contained significant heterogeneity. When subjects were limited to those with hypertension, those who performed endurance exercise and subjects who did not swim, pooled net changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly, but the heterogeneity of systolic blood pressure did not improve. Conclusion Like exercise on land, aquatic exercise should have a beneficial effect by lowering blood pressure. In addition, aquatic exercise should lower the blood pressure of subjects with hypertension, and other forms of aquatic exercise besides swimming should also lower blood pressure.",

The secondary aim was to assess the morphology of spastic muscle using ultrasonography. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-two children (17 boys, 15 girls; mean age 9.7±2.7 years; range 4 to 17 years) with CP were enrolled in this study. The patients were randomly assigned to two groups to receive 30 sessions of an aquatic or a land-based exercise program. The patients were assessed for the impairment level, functional measures, and quality of life before and after therapy. Ultrasonographic assessment of spastic gastrocnemius muscle was also performed. RESULTS: Both group showed significant improvements in most functional outcome measures. There were no significant differences in the percentage changes of the scores for functional outcome measures between the two groups. However, aquatic exercise produced a higher improvement in quality of life scores than the land-based exercises. Post-treatment ultrasonographic assessment of spastic gastrocnemius muscle showed a significant improvement in the compressibility ratio in the aquatic exercise group. The modified Ashworth Scale score of spastic gastrocnemius muscle in patients with CP showed a negative and weak-to-moderate correlation with the compressibility ratio based on the ultrasonographic evaluation. CONCLUSION: Our study results suggest that the aquatic exercises are as effective as land-based exercises for spasticity management and motor function improvement in children with CP. Aquatic exercise can result in a higher level of improvement in quality of life scores than the land- based exercises. Ultrasonographic muscle compressibility ratio may be used to evaluate muscle elasticity in children with CP."

DESIGN: Randomized controlled design. SETTING: Referral center of an MS society. PARTICIPANTS: Women (N=32; mean age ± SD, 36.4±8.2y) with diagnosed relapsing-remitting MS. After undergoing baseline testing by a neurologist, participants were allocated to either an intervention (aquatic training program, n=17) or a control group (n=15). INTERVENTIONS: The intervention consisted of an 8-week aquatic training program (3 supervised training sessions per week; session duration, 45-60min; 50%-75% estimated maximum heart rate). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Six-minute walk test (6-MWT), balance (Berg Balance Scale [BBS]), and perceptions of fatigue (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale; [MFIS]) at baseline and after the 8-week intervention. Differences over time between the experimental and control groups were assessed by a 2×2 (group by time) repeated-measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Thirty-two women completed the 8-week aquatic training intervention (experimental group, n=17; control group, n=15).

A significant group-by-time interaction was evident between the experimental and control groups for 6-MWT (P<.001, partial eta2 [ηp2]=.551), BBS (P<.001, ηp2=.423), and MFIS (P<.001, ηp2=.679). CONCLUSIONS: Aquatic exercise training improved functional capacity, balance, and perceptions of fatigue in women with MS.",

It was hypothesized that AquaEx would improve glycemic control to a similar extent as land-based exercise (LandEx), but to a greater extent than non-exercise control (Ctrl). METHODS: A literature search was completed in February 2017 for studies examining AquaEx training in adults with T2DM. Assessment of glycemic control was necessary for inclusion, while secondary outcomes such as quality of life and cardiometabolic risk factors (i.e., blood pressure, triglycerides and total cholesterol) were considered, but not required for inclusion. Outcomes were measured before and after at least 8 weeks of AquaEx, and data were analyzed using weighted mean differences (WMDs) and fixed effect models, when appropriate. RESULTS: Nine trials including 222 participants were identified. Three trials compared AquaEx to LandEx, two compared AquaEx to Crtl, and four had a pre-/post-design without a comparison group. Results indicate no difference in A1c between LandEx and AquaEx (WMD = -0.02%, 95% confidence interval = [-0.71, 0.66]). Post-intervention A1c was lower in AquaEx when compared to Crtl (WMD = -0.96%, [-1.87, -0.05]). Post-AquaEx A1c was lower compared to baseline (WMD = -0.48%, [-0.66, -0.30]). CONCLUSIONS: A1c can be reduced after eight-twelve weeks of AquaEx. However, at this time few studies have examined whether changes in A1c are different from LandEx or Crtl.",

The aquatic exercise program consisted of two sessions per week, each lasting between 45 and 60 minutes and divided into 5 to 10 minutes exercise sections during 12 weeks. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to determine anxiety levels while the Beck Depression Inventory was used as a self-assessment of depression. RESULTS: EG improved measures of depression, anxiety trait and anxiety state between pre- and post-treatment, with no changes in CG. EG improved in all tests related to functional capacity compared to CG.

The aim of the currents study was to advance this work by delivering the Watermemories Swimming Club aquatic exercise program to a more representative population of older, institutionalized adults with dementia. METHODS: The benefits of 12 weeks of twice weekly participation in the Watermemories Swimming Club aquatic exercise program were assessed among an exercise and usual care control group of residential aged care adults with advanced dementia. A battery of physical and psychosocial measures were collected before and after the intervention period, and program implementation was also investigated. RESULTS: Seven residential aged care facilities of 24 approached, agreed to participate and 56 residents were purposefully allocated to exercise or control. Twenty-three participants per group were included in the final analysis. Both groups experienced decreases in skeletal muscle index and lean mass (p < 0.001), but exercise stifled losses in muscle strength and transition into sarcopenic. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia and activities of daily living approached significance (p = 0.06) with positive trends observed across other psychosocial measures. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the value of exercise participation, and specifically aquatic exercise in comparison to usual care for older, institutionalized adults with advanced dementia. However, it also highlights a number of barriers to participation. To overcome these barriers and ensure opportunity to residents increased provider and sector support is required.",

METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was performed. In all, 34 obese women diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis participated. Women were randomly allocated to an experimental group (n = 17) or a control group (n = 17). Participants in the experimental group were included in an 8-week dance-based aquatic exercise program conducted in community swimming pools. Those in the control group underwent a global aquatic exercise program. The primary outcome measure was functionality assessed with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Secondary outcomes were cardiorespiratory capacity evaluated with the 6-minute walk test, and postexercise heart rate and fatigue assessed using a visual analog scale. Variables were measured at baseline, after the intervention, and at 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: A between-group analysis showed significant postintervention differences in functionality (aggregate postintervention WOMAC score of 37.30 ± 16.61 vs 41.83 ± 13.69; P = 0.048) in favor of the experimental group. In addition, significant between-group differences were found after the 8 weeks in cardiorespiratory capacity, postexercise heart rate, and fatigue. Follow-up continued to show significant differences between groups in function (aggregate WOMAC score of 38.60 ± 13.61 vs 42.60 ± 9.05; P = 0.038), postexercise heart rate, and fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: An 8-week dance-based exercise program significantly improved function and cardiorespiratory capacity, and decreased postexercise heart rate and fatigue. Most of these improvements were maintained at 3-month follow-up in obese postmenopausal women.",

INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to either an aquatic exercise therapy group (45min, twice a week for 6wk) or a group that received usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was gait variability as measured using a motion capture system. Secondary outcomes were quality of life measured on the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 and freezing of gait and motor disability quantified by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Feasibility was evaluated by measuring safety, adverse events, and participant satisfaction. RESULTS: People in the aquatic therapy group and usual care group showed similar small improvements in gait variability. The aquatic therapy group showed greater improvements in disability than the usual care group (P<.01). No differences between groups or over time were identified for freezing of gait or quality of life. Aquatic therapy sessions were safe and enjoyable with no adverse events.

DATA SOURCES: A systematic search used 5 databases, including MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, SPORTDiscus, and The Cochrane Library. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials evaluating aquatic exercise with a resistance training component for adults with musculoskeletal conditions compared with no intervention or land-based exercise were identified. Fifteen studies from the initial yield of 1214 met these criteria. DATA EXTRACTION: Data related to participant demographics, study design, and methods, interventions, and outcomes, including numerical means and SDs, were extracted independently by 2 reviewers. DATA SYNTHESIS: Nine of the 15 studies were of high quality, scoring at least 6 on the Physiotherapy Evidence Database Scale. Limited consideration of the prescription of resistance in the aquatic exercise and application of resistance training principles existed. Low- or very low-quality evidence indicates there was no difference in average effect between aquatic exercise and no exercise in improving hip abductor strength (standardized mean difference [SMD], .28; 95% confidence interval [CI], -.04 to .59), knee extensor strength (SMD, .18; 95% CI, -.03 to .40), knee flexor strength (SMD, .13; 95% CI, -.20 to .45), or lower limb endurance (SMD, .35; 95% CI, -.06 to .77). Low-quality evidence indicates no difference in average effect between aquatic and land exercise for knee extensor (SMD, -.24; 95% CI, -.49 to .02) or flexor strength (SMD, -.15; 95% CI, -.53 to .22). CONCLUSIONS: It is likely that the inadequate application of resistance in water is a significant contributor to the limited effectiveness of aquatic exercise interventions in improving hip and knee muscle strength in people with musculoskeletal conditions. Future research is needed to quantify resistance with aquatic exercises and to determine if using opportunities for greater resistance in aquatic rehabilitation and appropriate resistance training principles can be more effective in improving muscle strength.",

Exercising in water (aquatic exercise, AE) has been shown to be effective at improving physical functioning in this population; however, no systematic review with meta-analysis has been published. PURPOSE: to investigate the effect of AE on physical functioning in healthy older adults compared to control or land-based exercise (LE) through a systematic review with meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, Cinahl, PEDro, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, published before 31st December 2015. STUDY SELECTION: in total, 28 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review; 24 studies with 1,456 subjects (89% female) and with mean age 66.4 years were included in the meta-analysis. DATA EXTRACTION: data were extracted and checked for accuracy by three independent reviewers. DATA SYNTHESIS: size of treatment effect was measured using the standardised mean difference with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: compared to control interventions, AE had a moderate positive effect on physical functioning 0.70 [95% CI 0.48 to 0.92]. Compared to LE, AE had a small positive effect on physical functioning 0.39 [0.12 to 0.66]. LIMITATIONS: there is a high risk of bias and low methodological quality in the studies particularly when comparing AE to LE with possible over estimation of the benefit of AE. CONCLUSIONS: AE may improve physical functioning in healthy older people and is at least as effective as LE.",

METHOD: Forty male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups: knee OA - without treatment (OA); OA plus exercise program group (OAE); OA plus LLLT (OAL); OA plus exercise program associated with LLLT (OAEL). Trained rats performed a water-jumping program carrying a load equivalent to 50-80 % of their body mass strapped to their chest. The laser irradiation was used either as the only method or after the exercise training had been performed, at 2 points contact mode (medial and lateral side of the left joint). The treatments started 4 weeks after the surgery, 3 days/week for 8 weeks. RESULTS: The results revealed that all treated groups (irradiated or not) exhibited a better pattern of tissue organization, with less fibrillation and irregularities along the articular surface and improved chondrocytes organization. Also, a lower cellular density and structural damage (OARSI score) and higher thickness values were observed in all treated groups. Additionally, OAE and OAEL showed a reduced expression in IL-1β and caspase-3 as compared with OA. Furthermore, a statistically lower MMP-13 expression was only observed in OAEL as compared with OA. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that aquatic exercise program and LLLT were effective in preventing cartilage degeneration. Also, physical exercise program presented anti-inflammatory effects in the knees in OA rats.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis is a chronic disease characterized by joint pain, tenderness, and limitation of movement. At present, no cure is available. Thus only treatment of the person's symptoms and treatment to prevent further development of the disease are possible. Clinical trials indicate that aquatic exercise may have advantages for people with osteoarthritis. This is an update of a published Cochrane review. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of aquatic exercise for people with knee or hip osteoarthritis, or both, compared to no intervention. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases up to 28 April 2015: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2014), MEDLINE (from 1949), EMBASE (from 1980), CINAHL (from 1982), PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database), and Web of Science (from 1945). There was no language restriction. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled clinical trials of aquatic exercise compared to a control group (e.g. usual care, education, social attention, telephone call, waiting list for surgery) of participants with knee or hip osteoarthritis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the included trials. We analysed the pooled results using standardized mean difference (SMD) values. MAIN RESULTS: Nine new trials met the inclusion criteria and we excluded two earlier included trials. Thus the number of participants increased from 800 to 1190 and the number of included trials increased from six to 13. Most participants were female (75%), with an average age of 68 years and a body mass index (BMI) of 29.4. Osteoarthritis duration was 6.7 years, with a great variation of the included participants. The mean aquatic exercise duration was 12 weeks. We found 12 trials at low to unclear risk of bias for all domains except blinding of participants and personnel. They showed that aquatic exercise caused a small short term improvement compared to control in pain (SMD -0.31, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.15; 12 trials, 1076 participants) and disability (SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.17; 12 trials, 1059 participants). Ten trials showed a small effect on quality of life (QoL) (SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.01; 10 trials, 971 participants). These effects on pain and disability correspond to a five point lower (95% CI three to eight points lower) score on mean pain and mean disability compared to the control group (scale 0 to 100), and a seven point higher (95% CI 0 to 13 points higher) score on mean QoL compared with control group (scale 0 to 100). No included trials performed a radiographic evaluation. No serious adverse events were reported in the included trials with relation to aquatic exercise. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is moderate quality evidence that aquatic exercise may have small, short-term, and clinically relevant effects on patient-reported pain, disability, and QoL in people with knee and hip OA. The conclusions of this review update does not change those of the previous published version of this Cochrane review.",

      "abstract": "This multi-center quasi-experimental pilot study aimed to evaluate changes in pain, joint stiffness, physical function, and quality of life over 12 weeks in adults with musculoskeletal conditions attending 'Waves' aquatic exercise classes. A total of 109 adults (mean age, 65.2 years; range, 24-93 years) with musculoskeletal conditions were recruited across 18 Australian community aquatic centers. The intervention is a peer-led, 45 min, weekly aquatic exercise class including aerobic, strength, flexibility, and balance exercises (n = 67). The study also included a control group of people not participating in Waves or other formal exercise (n = 42). Outcomes were measured using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and EuroQoL five dimensions survey (EQ-5D) at baseline and 12 weeks. Satisfaction with Waves classes was also measured at 12 weeks. Eighty two participants (43 Waves and 39 control) completed the study protocol and were included in the analysis. High levels of satisfaction with classes were reported by Waves participants. Over 90 % of participants reported Waves classes were enjoyable and would recommend classes to others. Waves participants demonstrated improvements in WOMAC and EQ-5D scores however between-group differences did not reach statistical significance. Peer-led aquatic exercise classes appear to improve pain, joint stiffness, physical function and quality of life for people with musculoskeletal conditions. The diverse study sample is likely to have limited the power to detect significant changes in outcomes. Larger studies with an adequate follow-up period are needed to confirm effects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exercise has been found to be associated with improved sleep quality. However, most of the evidence is based on resistance exercise, walking, or gym-based aerobic activity. PURPOSE: This study aimed to examine the effects of an 8-week aquatic exercise program on objectively measured sleep parameters among older adults with mild sleep impairment. METHODS: A total of 67 eligible older adults with sleep impairment were selected and randomized to exercise and control groups, and 63 participants completed the study. The program involved 2 × 60-min sessions of aquatic exercise for 8 weeks. Participants wore wrist actigraphs to assess seven parameters of sleep for 1 week before and after the intervention. Mixed-design analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess the differences between groups in each of the sleep parameters. RESULTS: No significant group differences on demographic variables, life satisfaction, percentage of body fat, fitness, seated blood pressure, and any parameter of sleep were found at baseline. Significant group × time interaction effects were found in sleep onset latency, F(1,58) = 6.921, p = .011, partial eta squared = .011, and in sleep efficiency, F(1, 61) = 16.909, p < 0.001, partial eta squared = .217. The exercise group reported significantly less time on sleep onset latency (mean difference = 7.9 min) and greater sleep efficiency (mean difference = 5.9 %) than the control group at posttest. There was no significant difference between groups in change of total sleep time, wake after sleep onset, activity counts, or number and length of awakenings. CONCLUSIONS: An 8-week aquatic exercise has significant benefits on some sleep parameters, including less time for sleep onset latency and better sleep efficiency in older adults with mild sleep impairment.",

METHODS: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, CAMbase, and the Web of Science were screened through to June 2014. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing aquatic exercise with control conditions were included. Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the included trials, and extracted data. Outcome measures included pain, physical function, joint stiffness, quality of life (QOL), and safety. Pooled outcomes were analyzed using standardized mean difference (SMD). RESULTS: There is a lack of high quality studies in this area. Six RCTs (398 participants) were included. There was moderate evidence for a moderate effect on physical function in favor of aquatic exercise immediately after the intervention, but no evidence for pain or QOL when comparing aquatic exercise with nonexercise. Only one trial reported 3 months of follow-up measurements, which demonstrated limited evidence for pain improvement with aquatic exercise and no evidence for QOL or physical function when comparing aquatic exercise with nonexercise. There was limited evidence for pain improvement with land-based exercise and no evidence for QOL or physical function, when comparing aquatic exercise with land-based exercise according to follow-up measurements. No evidence was found for pain, physical function, stiffness, QOL, or mental health with aquatic exercise immediately after the intervention when comparing aquatic exercise with land-based exercise. Two studies reported aquatic exercise was not associated with serious adverse events. CONCLUSION: Aquatic exercise appears to have considerable short-term benefits compared with land-based exercise and nonexercise in patients with knee OA. Based on these results, aquatic exercise is effective and safe and can be considered as an adjuvant treatment for patients with knee OA. Studies in this area are still too scarce and too short-term to provide further recommendations on how to apply this therapy.",

The subjects were divided into control group, exercise group, and exercise+CES group. Blood samples for BDNF, IGF-1, and VEGF were taken from brachial vein at rest between before and after treatment. RESULTS: The results are summarized as follows: Cognitive function level increased significantly in the exercise+CES group compared to those in the exercise and control group. The changes of blood IGF-1 concentration were no significant difference among groups. The changes of blood BDNF and VEGF concentration were significantly increased in exercise group and exercise+CES group than control group. However, blood BDNF and VEGF concentration were significantly difference between exercise group and exercise+CES group. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, it can be concluded that CES treatment with exercise can amend cognitive function of persons with intellectual disabilities more effectively and increase of BDNF and VEGF by exercise can explain the cognitive function improvement of persons with intellectual disabilities."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exercise training is commonly recommended for individuals with fibromyalgia. This review examined the effects of supervised group aquatic training programs (led by an instructor). We defined aquatic training as exercising in a pool while standing at waist, chest, or shoulder depth. This review is part of the update of the 'Exercise for treating fibromyalgia syndrome' review first published in 2002, and previously updated in 2007. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the benefits and harms of aquatic exercise training in adults with fibromyalgia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 2 (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Health Technology Assessment Database, NHS Economic Evaluation Database), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PEDro, Dissertation Abstracts, WHO international Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and AMED, as well as other sources (i.e., reference lists from key journals, identified articles, meta-analyses, and reviews of all types of treatment for fibromyalgia) from inception to October 2013. Using Cochrane methods, we screened citations, abstracts, and full-text articles. Subsequently, we identified aquatic exercise training studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Selection criteria were: a) full-text publication of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in adults diagnosed with fibromyalgia based on published criteria, and b) between-group data for an aquatic intervention and a control or other intervention. We excluded studies if exercise in water was less than 50% of the full intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data (24 outcomes), of which we designated seven as major outcomes: multidimensional function, self reported physical function, pain, stiffness, muscle strength, submaximal cardiorespiratory function, withdrawal rates and adverse effects. We resolved discordance through discussion. We evaluated interventions using mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Where two or more studies provided data for an outcome, we carried out meta-analysis. In addition, we set and used a 15% threshold for calculation of clinically relevant differences. MAIN RESULTS: We included 16 aquatic exercise training studies (N = 881; 866 women and 15 men). Nine studies compared aquatic exercise to control, five studies compared aquatic to land-based exercise, and two compared aquatic exercise to a different aquatic exercise program.We rated the risk of bias related to random sequence generation (selection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), selective reporting (reporting bias), blinding of outcome assessors (detection bias), and other bias as low. We rated blinding of participants and personnel (selection and performance bias) and allocation concealment (selection bias) as low risk and unclear. The assessment of the evidence showed limitations related to imprecision, high statistical heterogeneity, and wide confidence intervals. Aquatic versus controlWe found statistically significant improvements (P value < 0.05) in all of the major outcomes. Based on a 100-point scale, multidimensional function improved by six units (MD -5.97, 95% CI -9.06 to -2.88; number needed to treat (NNT) 5, 95% CI 3 to 9), self reported physical function by four units (MD -4.35, 95% CI -7.77 to -0.94; NNT 6, 95% CI 3 to 22), pain by seven units (MD -6.59, 95% CI -10.71 to -2.48; NNT 5, 95% CI 3 to 8), and stiffness by 18 units (MD -18.34, 95% CI -35.75 to -0.93; NNT 3, 95% CI 2 to 24) more in the aquatic than the control groups. The SMD for muscle strength as measured by knee extension and hand grip was 0.63 standard deviations higher compared to the control group (SMD 0.63, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.05; NNT 4, 95% CI 3 to 12) and cardiovascular submaximal function improved by 37 meters on six-minute walk test (95% CI 4.14 to 69.92). Only two major outcomes, stiffness and muscle strength, met the 15% threshold for clinical relevance (improved by 27% and 37% respectively). Withdrawals were similar in the aquatic and control groups and adverse effects were poorly reported, with no serious adverse effects reported. Aquatic versus land-basedThere were no statistically significant differences between interventions for multidimensional function, self reported physical function, pain or stiffness: 0.91 units (95% CI -4.01 to 5.83), -5.85 units (95% CI -12.33 to 0.63), -0.75 units (95% CI -10.72 to 9.23), and two units (95% CI -8.88 to 1.28) respectively (all based on a 100-point scale), or in submaximal cardiorespiratory function (three seconds on a 100-meter walk test, 95% CI -1.77 to 7.77). We found a statistically significant difference between interventions for strength, favoring land-based training (2.40 kilo pascals grip strength, 95% CI 4.52 to 0.28). None of the outcomes in the aquatic versus land comparison reached clinically relevant differences of 15%. Withdrawals were similar in the aquatic and land groups and adverse effects were poorly reported, with no serious adverse effects in either group. Aquatic versus aquatic (Ai Chi versus stretching in the water, exercise in pool water versus exercise in sea water)Among the major outcomes the only statistically significant difference between interventions was for stiffness, favoring Ai Chi (1.00 on a 100-point scale, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.69). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Low to moderate quality evidence relative to control suggests that aquatic training is beneficial for improving wellness, symptoms, and fitness in adults with fibromyalgia. Very low to low quality evidence suggests that there are benefits of aquatic and land-based exercise, except in muscle strength (very low quality evidence favoring land). No serious adverse effects were reported.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a combination of aquatic exercise and pain neurophysiology education with aquatic exercise alone in chronic low back pain patients. DESIGN: Single-blind randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Outpatient clinic. SUBJECTS: Sixty-two chronic low back pain patients were randomly allocated to receive aquatic exercise and pain neurophysiology education (n = 30) or aquatic exercise alone (n = 32). INTERVENTIONS: Twelve sessions of a 6-week aquatic exercise programme preceded by 2 sessions of pain neurophysiology education. Controls received only 12 sessions of the 6-week aquatic exercise programme. MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcomes were pain intensity (Visual Analogue Scale) and functional disability (Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale) at the baseline, 6 weeks after the beginning of the aquatic exercise programme and at the 3 months follow-up. Secondary outcome was kinesiophobia (Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia). RESULTS: Fifty-five participants completed the study. Analysis using mixed-model ANOVA revealed a significant treatment condition interaction on pain intensity at the 3 months follow-up, favoring the education group (mean SD change: -25.4± 26.7 vs -6.6 ± 30.7, P < 0.005). Although participants in the education group were more likely to report perceived functional benefits from treatment at 3 months follow-up (RR=1.63, 95%CI: 1.01-2.63), no significant differences were found in functional disability and kinesiophobia between groups at any time. CONCLUSIONS: This study's findings support the provision of pain neurophysiology education as a clinically effective addition to aquatic exercise.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is a multifactorial progressive skeletal disorder characterized by reduced bone mass. Exercise is widely recommended to reduce osteoporosis, falls and related fragility fractures. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of land exercise (LE) and aquatic exercise (AE) on physical function and bone mineral density (BMD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-eight postmenopausal women, aged 50-70 years, diagnosed with osteoporosis according to BMD measures, enrolled in this study. The subjects were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (LE group) or the control group (AE group). Physical function and BMD were assessed in all subjects in both groups before and after 10 months of intervention. Muscle strength, flexibility, balance, gait time and pain were measured to assess physical function. Bone mineral density at the lumbar spine was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two groups in the baseline anthropometric data. The two groups were similar with respect to age, weight, height, and body mass index (p>0.05). After the exercise program, muscle strength, flexibility, gait time, pain, and bone density (p<0.001) improved significantly with LE compared to AE. There was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to balance at the 10-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: Significant improvements in physical function and BMD suggest that LE is a possible alternative for postmenopausal women with OP.",
