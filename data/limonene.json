      "abstract": "Ovarian ischemia, most commonly caused by torsion, represents a critical gynecological emergency. Oxidative stress is central to ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), highlighting the importance of investigating antioxidant therapies such as D-limonene. This study evaluates the protective effects of D-limonene in a rat model of ovarian IRI. Twenty-four adult female Wistar albino rats were assigned to four groups: Sham (laparotomy only), Ischemia/Reperfusion (IR; laparotomy followed by 2-h ischemia and 2-h reperfusion), Limonene 50 mg/kg (L50; laparotomy followed by 2-h ischemia, administration of 50 mg/kg D-limonene 30 min before reperfusion, and 2-hour reperfusion), and Limonene 100 mg/kg (L100; same protocol with 100 mg/kg D-limonene). Ovarian samples were collected 2 h after reperfusion for oxidative stress parameters (TAS, TOS, OSI, MDA, SOD, NO), histopathological, and TUNEL assay evaluations. MDA and TOS levels were significantly lower in the treatment groups compared to the IR group (p < 0.05). SOD, NO, and TAS levels were higher in the treatment groups than in the IR group, although these differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Histopathological evaluations demonstrated reduced edema, vascular congestion, hemorrhage, leukocyte infiltration, and follicular degeneration in the treatment groups compared to the IR group. TUNEL assays revealed fewer apoptotic cells in the treatment groups. In conclusion, D-limonene significantly reduces ovarian injury caused by ischemia and reperfusion, exerting antioxidant effects and protecting against apoptosis."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to develop a novel, refrigeration-free preservation method to extend quail egg shelf life and enhance consumer safety. The antimicrobial efficacy of limonene vapor against Salmonella Enteritidis and Staphylococcus aureus was evaluated. Limonene nanoemulsions (0.04%, 0.08%, and 0.12%) were used to generate vapor for coating eggshells. The coating process was performed using an ultrasonic device with a controllable temperature chamber to maintain different temperatures: 4°C (cold), 25°C (medium), and 37°C (high temperature). The antimicrobial efficacy was enhanced by applying UV irradiation for 10 min. The mode of action was analyzed through bacterial morphology, biofilm formation, and cell leakage. Limonene vapor (0.08%) at 4°C with ultraviolet (UV) reduced Salmonella Enteritidis and S. aureus by 6-7 log10 on eggshells, whereas at 25°C and 37°C, the reductions were only 3.5 log10 and 2.8 log10, respectively. Salmonella was not detected, and S. aureus remained within food safety standards when quail eggs were stored at 30 ± 2°C for 10 days, compared with the control, which showed bacterial growth within one day. Possible mechanisms of action suggested that cold-generated limonene formed a thin film on the eggshell surface. This film caused deformation and abnormal morphology in Salmonella Enteritidis cells and induced pore formation in S. aureus cell walls, enhancing bacterial cell injury. UV exposure further exacerbated cellular damage, resulting in a synergistic antimicrobial effect. However, this method did not cause significant membrane damage or lead to substantial leakage of intracellular materials in S. aureus. This method was cost-effective and could be adapted for on-farm application before distribution, ensuring safer eggs for consumers."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Chronic alcohol overconsumption triggers alcohol liver injury, and therapeutic strategies targeting alcohol-triggered oxidative stress and hepatic inflammatory responses represent potential approaches to ameliorating alcohol-related hepatotoxicity. This study aimed to determine the hepatoprotective activity of finger citron essential oil (FCEO) in alcoholic liver disease (ALD)-afflicted rats and explore its underlying mechanisms. In order to identify the effective components, we compared the effects of FCEO and D-limonene. Methods: The regulatory effects of FCEO on metabolic enzymes were systematically evaluated through in vitro experiments. In vivo studies were conducted to investigate and compare the hepatoprotective effects of FCEO and D-limonene. Staining methods, assay kits, and Western Blot were used to determine the roles of FCEO and D-limonene in the ALD rats. Results: We found that FCEO downregulated phase I metabolic enzymes and upregulated phase II metabolic enzymes in Buffalo Rat Liver-3A (BRL-3A) cells. FCEO and/or D-limonene intervention reduced transaminase levels in ALD rats and effectively alleviated inflammatory cell infiltration and lipid droplet accumulation in their liver tissue. Additionally, FCEO and D-limonene played a regulatory role in oxidative stress and inflammation-related pathways such as the MAPK/Nrf2 and NF-κB/AMPK pathways. FCEO was superior to D-limonene as an antioxidant in alleviating alcoholic liver injury. Conclusions: This study revealed the alleviative effects and mechanisms of FCEO on alcoholic liver injury, demonstrating better efficacy compared to its monomer, thus providing a strategy for the development and utilization of finger citron resources.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by itching and redness, affecting individuals of all ages and significantly impairing their quality of life. The prevalence of AD is rising, posing serious health concern. Relief of itching is a primary treatment objective; however, steroid treatments can lead to adverse effects, including skin barrier thinning. Therefore, there is a pressing need for safer therapeutic alternatives. Limonene, a naturally occurring monocyclic monoterpene found in citrus peel oil, is widely utilized in food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. Research has identified various biological activities of limonene, including antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antifibrotic properties. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic effects of limonene on atopic dermatitis, focusing on its anti-inflammatory potential. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, conducting histopathological analyses, and collecting physiological data from BALB/c mice with atopic-like dermatitis induced by 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) and TNF-α/ IFN-γ-stimulated HaCaT cells. RESULTS: In vitro studies indicated that limonene inhibited cytokine and chemokine expression in human keratinocytes and reduced phosphorylation in the MAPK, NF-κB, and JAK/STAT signaling pathways. In vivo, limonene mitigated DNCB-induced skin barrier damage and itching, improving physiological parameters such as trans-epidermal water loss, erythema, and ear thickness. Furthermore, it decreased the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSION: Limonene exhibits significant anti-inflammatory effects, highlighting its therapeutic potential for treating atopic dermatitis.",

      "abstract": "Decreased saliva production due to salivary gland damage can result in difficulty speaking and swallowing, significantly reducing quality of life for head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy. It is therefore imperative that treatment options are available to mitigate the effects of these debilitating side effects. D-limonene, a naturally occurring terpene, has shown protective effects on saliva production during radiotherapy treatment of mice, however the lipophilic nature of the molecule has necessitated a high oral dose to facilitate sufficient absorption. In this study, lipid-based drug delivery systems have been utilised to formulate D-limonene in order to reduce undesirable gastrointestinal side effects and increase solubility for enhanced absorption. Lipid-based formulations produced up to 180-fold increased solubility over pure D-limonene, coupled with enhanced storage stability and protection against oxidation. Furthermore, pharmacokinetic evaluation of optimised lipid-based formulations in Sprague Dawley rats displayed up to a 51.25-fold increase in bioavailability relative to pure oral D-limonene. Finally, elevated levels of lipid-formulated D-limonene were localised within the submandibular salivary glands, indicating potential for local action on saliva production. Overall, the administration of D-limonene utilising lipid-based formulations shows significant promise for advancing prevention and treatment strategies for xerostomia.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: D-limonene (D-L) is the major monocyclic monoterpene in citrus plants with anti-inflammatory properties. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) can cause right heart dysfunction and increases the risk of death, partially due to inflammatory response in the heart. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the possible protective effect of D-L on cardiac function in a rat model of monocrotaline-induced PH (MCT-PH). METHODS: Electrocardiogram was monitored in vivo. Masson Trichrome technique was deployed to verify fibrosis in the heart. Contractility function of isolated atrial tissue was studied using organ bath chamber. Real-time quantitative PCR was applied to quantify inflammation in the right ventricle. RESULTS: The MCT-PH group showed electrical and structural heart remodeling, with the presence of fibrosis in the cardiac tissue and in vivo electrocardiographic changes. Treatment with D-L partially prevented the development of tissue fibrosis and the increase in P wave duration in the MCT-PH group. The contraction and relaxation velocity of isolated right and left atrium were accelerated in CTR and MCT-PH animals treated with D-L. Finally, D-L was able to prevent the abnormal expression of the key inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1-β, interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor-α) in the right ventricle of MCT-PH animals. D-L was able to enhance the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin-10. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that in vivo administration of D-L partially prevented the molecular, structural and functional remodeling of the heart in the MCT-PH model with attenuation of the inflammatory response in the heart.",

      "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a persistent autoimmune disorder predominantly affecting the joint structures, eliciting inflammatory responses, and ultimately leading to degenerative changes without proper medical intervention. Ultimately, this can severely impair joint function and impact the patient's quality of life. Current treatment approaches include disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, corticosteroids, and biologic therapies for RA management. The current study contributes to the ongoing advancements in RA treatment. d-Limonene is a monocyclic monoterpene. It is present in essential oils of various aromatic plants, such as Lippia alba and Artemisia dracunculus, and in citrus fruits such as lemon and orange. It has reported anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive properties and was selected for the current study as a potential anti-arthritic candidate. It was administered at three dosages (25, 50, 100 mg/kg, b.w., p.o) in Complete Freund's adjuvant-induced arthritic rats over 28 days. The efficacy of the compound was compared to piroxicam, a widely used standard drug for treating RA. The anti-arthritic activity of the compound was assessed by measuring arthritic scoring and plethysmometry at both baseline and post-intervention stages. Additional confirmation of the investigation was sought by performing biochemical and hematological activities. Moreover, quantitative polymerase chain reaction was employed to determine the levels of messenger RNA expression for transcription factors such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, nuclear factor-κB, matrix metalloproteinase-3, IL-6, and IL-4 in the blood. The levels of PGE2 were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The histopathological and radiographic studies were also carried out for further confirmation. The results of these findings supported our assertion regarding the anti-arthritic potential of the compound.",

      "abstract": "D-limonene extracted from citrus peels possesses an inhibitory effect on methanogenic archaea. This study is aimed to bridge the research gap on the influence of D-limonene on volatile fatty acids (VFA) production from waste activated sludge (WAS) and to address the low VFA yield in standalone anaerobic fermentation of WAS. When the initial pH was not controlled, 1.00 g/g TSS D-limonene resulted in a VFA accumulation of 1175.45 ± 101.36 mg/L (174.45 ± 8.13 mgCOD/gVS). When the initial pH was controlled at 10 and the D-limonene concentration was 0.50 g/g TSS, the VFA accumulation reached 2707.44 ± 183.65 mg/L (445.51 ± 17.10 mgCOD/gVS). The pH-regulated D-limonene treatment enhanced solubilization and acidification, slightly inhibited hydrolysis, and significantly suppressed methanogenesis. D-limonene under alkaline conditions can increase the relative abundance of Clostridium_sensu_stricto, significantly enhancing acidification. Moreover, it markedly inhibited methanogenesis by particularly reducing the relative abundance of Methanothrix that was responsible for acetate consumption, thus favoring the accumulation of VFA. The research reveals the potential mechanism of pH regulation and D-limonene on anaerobic fermentation acid production, providing a theoretical basis for improving the acid production performance of the anaerobic fermentation of WAS.",

Different concentrations of DL-Limonene, R-Limonene, and Cisplatin, combined, were used to treat MDA-MB-231 and 5637 cells in this experimental study. The cell's viability was evaluated using an MTT assay. AnnexinV- PI staining was applied to evaluate the percentage of apoptotic cells. Cytotoxicity results showed that combining DL-Limonene, R-Limonene, and Cisplatin significantly improved outcomes in MDA-MB-231 cells (P < 0.05). Annexin/PI staining revealed apoptosis rates of 74 %, 28 %, 43 %, 81 %, and 91 % for Cisplatin40, R-Limonen1000, DL-Limonen1000, R-Limonen1000/DL-Limonen1000, and the combined treatment, respectively, versus 13 % in the control. The combination also resulted in the greatest reduction of AKT, PI3K, and mTOR gene expression. Our results show that R-Limonene and DL-Limonene enhance Cisplatin's cancer-inhibiting effects in breast and bladder cancer cell lines. These compounds may be promising for combination therapy, potentially allowing for lower doses of chemotherapy and reducing side effects like nephrotoxicity.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Glioblastoma (GBM), which is a heterogeneous and aggressive type of brain tumor, is known for its poor survival outcomes. The treatment of GBM remains challenging primarily due to the drug resistance to the current standard therapeutic option, temozolomide (TMZ). Researchers are currently focusing on developing an appropriate alternative combinatorial therapeutic to enhance treatment outcomes. D-limonene (DL) is a monoterpene derived from citrus fruit. This study aims to assess the impact of combining DL with TMZ and explore its potential mechanism of action in U87MG and LN229 GBM cells. METHODS: The effects of the combined treatment of DL and TMZ were assessed on various cellular aspects, including cell viability, anchorage-independent cell growth, and DNA damage. Furthermore, the influence of this combination on cell cycle progression, cell migration, and cell death was also investigated. RESULTS: The combination of DL+TMZ demonstrated a synergistic effect, resulting in reduced cell proliferation and suppressing the colony formation ability of a single cell. Treatment with DL and TMZ arrested the cells in G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, the DL+TMZ combination induced apoptosis by upregulating the expression of Bax, and Caspase (CASP)-3, while reducing the expression of the Bcl-2 gene in GBM cells. In addition, the combined treatment of DL+TMZ significantly decreased the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9, expression, indicating inhibition of cell migration in GBM cells. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the combination of DL and TMZ demonstrated a synergistic effect in reducing cell proliferation, suppressing colony formation, inducing apoptosis, and inhibiting cell migration in GBM cells. These findings suggest the potential of DL+TMZ combination therapy as an effective treatment for GBM."

      "abstract": "The excessive use of conventional medications to treat coccidiosis has led to concerns regarding drug residues in tissues and the emergence of multidrug resistance. Essential oils with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities may also have anticoccidial effects. The present study investigated the efficacy of D-limonene and its nanoemulsion form against Eimeria tenella in chickens. An in vitro study was conducted to evaluate the sporulation inhibitory effects of D-limonene on Eimeria tenella oocysts. Five D-limonene concentrations (0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10% v/v) were tested alongside positive (10% formalin) and negative (2.5% potassium dichromate) controls. Each ELISA plate well was inoculated with 1200 unsporulated oocysts and incubated at 30 °C for 24, 48, and 72 h. Subsequently, samples were microscopically examined to assess sporulation inhibition and calculate the percentage of sporulated oocysts. For the in vivo study, 125 eight-day-old broiler chicks were divided into five groups of 25 birds each. The control negative group remained uninfected and untreated. The control positive group was challenged with 5 × 104 sporulated Eimeria tenella oocysts. The diclazuril group received 0.2 mg/kg diclazuril in their diet two days prior to, and until 10 days post infection. The D-limonene (DL) and D-limonene nanoemulsion (DLN) groups were challenged with 5 × 104 sporulated E. tenella oocysts at 18 days of age and administered 150 mg/L of their respective treatments in drinking water from day eight until the end of the experiment. Results from the in vitro study demonstrated that D-limonene suppressed oocyst sporulation by 50.83% at its highest concentration of 10%. In the in vivo study, both DL and DLN treated groups exhibited a significant reduction in oocyst output per gram of feces (OPG), along with increased body weight and decreased parasite stages in the cecal tissue. Furthermore, these treatments were associated with elevated levels of antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (GPX), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD), accompanied by a decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) levels. Particularly, DLN treatment remarkably increased the number of goblet cells. In conclusion, D-limonene and its nanoemulsion represent promising alternatives for managing coccidiosis in poultry. They not only effectively control parasites but also promote intestinal health and boost antioxidant defenses.",

      "abstract": "Limonene, a dietary monocyclic monoterpene commonly found in citrus fruits and various aromatic plants, has garnered increasing interest as a gastrointestinal protectant. This study aimed to assess the effects of limonene on intestinal epithelial barrier function and investigate the involvement of cannabinoid receptor type-1 (CB1R) in vitro. Additionally, the study focused on examining the metabolomic changes induced by limonene in the intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2). Initial analysis of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) revealed that both l-limonene and d-limonene, isomers of limonene, led to a dose- and time-dependent increase in TEER in normal cells and those inflamed by pro-inflammatory cytokines mixture (CytoMix). Furthermore, both types of limonene reduced CytoMix-induced paracellular permeability, as demonstrated by a decrease in Lucifer yellow flux. Moreover, d-limonene and l-limonene treatment increased the expression of tight junction molecules (TJs) such as occludin, claudin-1, and ZO-1, at both the transcriptional and translational levels. d-Limonene upregulates E-cadherin, a molecule involved in adherens junctions (AJs). Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that d-limonene and l-limonene treatment significantly inhibited CB1R at the protein, while the mRNA level remained unchanged. Notably, the inhibitory effect of d-limonene on CB1R was remarkably similar to that of pharmacological CB1R antagonists, such as rimonabant and ORG27569. d-limonene also alters Caco-2 cell metabolites. A substantial reduction in β-glucose and 2-succinamate was detected, suggesting limonene may impact intestinal epithelial cells' glucose uptake and glutamate metabolism. These findings suggest that d-limonene's CB1R antagonistic property could effectively aid in the recovery of intestinal barrier damage, marking it a promising gastrointestinal protectant.",

      "abstract": "Leishmaniases, a group of neglected tropical diseases caused by an intracellular parasite of the genus Leishmania, have significant impacts on global health. Current treatment options are limited due to drug resistance, toxicity, and high cost. This study aimed to develop nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) for delivering Citrus sinensis essential oil (CSEO) and its main constituent, R-limonene, against leishmaniasis. The influence of surface-modified NLCs using chitosan was also examined. The NLCs were prepared using a warm microemulsion method, and surface modification with chitosan was achieved through electrostatic interaction. These nanocarriers were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering (DLS). In vitro cytotoxicity was assessed in L929 and RAW 264.7 cells, and leishmanicidal activity was evaluated against promastigote and amastigote forms. The NLCs were spherical, with particle sizes ranging from 97.9 nm to 111.3 nm. Chitosan-coated NLCs had a positive surface charge, with zeta potential values ranging from 45.8 mV to 59.0 mV. Exposure of L929 cells to NLCs resulted in over 70 % cell viability. Conversely, surface modification significantly reduced the viability of promastigotes (93 %) compared to free compounds. Moreover, chitosan-coated NLCs presented a better IC50 against the amastigote forms than uncoated NLCs. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the feasibility of using NLCs to overcome the limitations of current leishmaniasis treatments, warranting further research.",

      "abstract": "Nanoemulsions have carved their position in topical delivery owing to their peculiar features of forming a uniform film on the skin and conquering stratum corneum barrier and hence fostering dermal penetration and retention. The present work developed syringic acid nanoemulsion (SA-NE) by spontaneous emulsification as an anti-psoriatic remedy via the dermal route. SA-NE were prepared with either lauroglycol90, limonene or their combination (oil phase) and tween80 (surfactant) with variable concentrations. The physicochemical characteristics of SA-NE were assessed together with Ex-vivo skin deposition and dermal toxicity. The effectiveness of optimal formula in psoriatic animal model and psoriatic patients was investigated using PASI scoring and dermoscope examination. Results showed that, SA-NE containing mixture of lauroglycol 90, limonene and 10 % tween80 (F5), was selected as the optimal formula presenting stable nanoemulsion for 2-month period, showing droplet size of 177.6 ± 13.23 nm, polydispersity index of 0.16 ± 0.06, zeta potential of -21.23 ± 0.41 mV. High SA% in different skin strata and no dermal irritation was noticed with limonene-based SA-NE also it showed high in-vitro anti- inflammatory potential compared to the blank and control formulations. A preclinical study demonstrated that limonene-based SA-NE is effective in alleviating psoriasis-like skin lesions against imiquimod-induced psoriasis in rats. Clinically, promising anti-psoriatic potential was asserted as all patients receiving F5 experienced better clinical improvement and response to therapy, achieving ≥ 50 % reduction in PASI scores versus only 35 % responders in the Dermovate® cream group. Collectively, the practical feasibility of limonene-based SA-NE topical delivery can boost curative functionality in the treatment of psoriatic lesions.",

Designing new anticancer strategies and understanding the mechanism of action of anticancer agents is imperative. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: In this study, we evaluated the utility of metformin and D-limonene, alone or in combination, as potential anticancer therapeutics using the human liver and breast cancer cell lines HepG2 and MCF-7. STUDY DESIGN: An integrated systems pharmacology approach is presented for illustrating the molecular interactions between metformin and D-limonene. METHODS: We applied a systems-based analysis to introduce a drug-target-pathway network that clarifies different mechanisms of treatment. The combination treatment of metformin and D-limonene induced apoptosis in both cell lines compared with single drug treatments, as indicated by flow cytometric and gene expression analysis. RESULTS: The mRNA expression of Bax and P53 genes were significantly upregulated while Bcl-2, iNOS, and Cox-2 were significantly downregulated in all treatment groups compared with normal cells. The percentages of late apoptotic HepG2 and MCF-7 cells were higher in all treatment groups, particularly in the combination treatment group. Calculations for the combination index (CI) revealed a synergistic effect between both drugs for HepG2 cells (CI = 0.14) and MCF-7 cells (CI = 0.22). CONCLUSION: Our data show that metformin, D-limonene, and their combinations exerted significant antitumor effects on the cancer cell lines by inducing apoptosis and modulating the expression of apoptotic genes.",

AIM: This study was undertaken to evaluate the antifungal efficacy of limonene against clinical Candida isolates from CLP patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antifungal efficacy of limonene was studied alone and in combination with fluconazole (FLC) against six standards, twenty nine FLC sensitive, and three FLC resistant clinical strains using broth dilution, checkerboard microdilution, agar disk diffusion, growth curves, and spot assays. RESULTS: This nontoxic monoterpene gave low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 300-375 µg/mL and 500-520 µg/mL for FLC susceptible and FLC resistant strains, respectively. It showed synergistic interaction with FLC in all clinical and standard Candida strains (fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index ≤0.5). CONCLUSION: Significant chemosensitization of FLC was observed even against resistant clinical isolates. Complete suppression of fungal growth was observed when using combinations. Negligible toxicity, easy availability, and potent antifungal properties suggest that limonene and FLC combinations in appropriate doses can make excellent antifungal mouthwashes during CLP treatment pre and post surgery. Impending in vivo studies are needed to validate the present data."

From an environmentally friendly, sustainable, and efficient point of view, in this study, we explored the function of d-limonene in reducing the acquisition and transmission of TYLCV by B. tabaci as a repellent volatile. D-limonene increased the duration of non-feeding waves and reduced the duration of phloem feeding in non-viruliferous and viruliferous whiteflies by the Electrical Penetration Graph technique (EPG). Additionally, after treatment with d-limonene, the acquisition and transmission rate of TYLCV was reduced. Furthermore, BtabOBP3 was determined as the molecular target for recognizing d-limonene by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), fluorescence competitive binding assays, and molecular docking. These results confirmed that d-limonene is an important functional volatile which showed a potential contribution against viral infections with potential implications for developing effective TYLCV control strategies.",

Using HFD-fed male and female zebrafish, we were able to develop an animal model of T2D and identify several endogenous metabolites that might be used as diagnostic biomarkers for diabetes. The endogenous metabolites in males and females were different, even though both genders had high blood glucose levels and a high BMI. Treatment with limonene prevented high blood glucose levels and improved in diabesity zebrafish by limonene, through reversal of the metabolic changes caused by HFD in both genders. In addition, limonene was able to reverse the elevated expression of AKT during HFD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic bronchitis (CB), a type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), poses a significant global health burden owing to its high morbidity and mortality rates. Eucalyptol, limonene and pinene enteric capsules (ELPs) are clinically used as expectorants to treat various respiratory diseases, including CB, but their acting mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the anti-CB effects of ELP in a rat model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced CB. The molecular mechanisms underlying its inhibitory effects on airway inflammation were further explored in LPS-stimulated Beas-2B cells. METHODS: ELP was characterized using gas chromatography. The production of inflammatory mediators in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of MUC5AC, MUC5B, and p-p65 in the lung tissue was measured using immunohistochemical staining. The gene expression of inflammatory mediators was determined using qRT-PCR. The expression levels of the target proteins were detected by western blotting. Nuclear localization of p65 was determined using an immunofluorescence assay. RESULTS: Compared to the CB model rats, ELP-treated rats showed reduced airway resistance, inflammation, and goblet cell hyperplasia. In BALF, ELP decreased the levels of inflammatory mediators, including TNF-α, IL-6, MIP-1α, and CCL5. ELP also suppressed LPS-induced elevation of MUC5AC, MUC5B, and p-p65 in the lung tissue. The metabolic pathway changes caused by LPS challenge were improved by ELP treatment. In LPS-exposed Beas-2B cells, ELP treatment inhibited the expression of TNFA, IL6, CCL5, MCP1, and MIP2A and decreased the phospho-levels of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling-related proteins, including p-p38, p-JNK, p-ERK, p-TBK1, p-IKKα/β, p-IκB, p-p65, and p-c-Jun. ELP also hindered the nuclear translocation of p65, c-Jun, and IRF3. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that ELP has a potential therapeutic effect in LPS-induced CB rat model, possibly by suppressing TLR4 signaling. These results justify the clinical use of ELP for the treatment of pulmonary inflammatory diseases.",

Peritoneal adhesions were induced by creating different incisions and excising a 1 × 1 cm section of the peritoneum. The experimental groups included a sham group, a control group in which peritoneal adhesions were induced without any treatment, and two treatment groups in which animals received D-limonene with dosages of 25 and 50 mg/kg after inducing peritoneal adhesions. Macroscopic examination of adhesions showed that both treatment groups had reduced adhesion bands in comparison to the control group. Immunohistochemical assessment of TGF-β1, TNF-α, and VEGF on day 14 revealed a significant increment in the level of immunopositive cells for the mentioned markers in the control group, whereas administration of limonene in both doses significantly reduced levels of TGF-β1, TNF-α, and VEGF (P < 0.05). Induction of peritoneal adhesions in the control group significantly increased TGF-β1, TNF-α, and VEGF on days 3 and 14 in western blot evaluation, while treatment with limonene significantly reduced TNF-α level on day 14 (P < 0.05). Moreover, VEGF levels in both treatment groups significantly reduced on days 3 and 14. In the control group, a significant increment in the levels of MDA and NO and a notable decline in the levels of GPX, CAT was observed (P < 0.05). Limonene 50 group significantly reduced MDA level and increased GPx and CAT levels on day 14 (P < 0.05). In summary, D-limonene reduced adhesion bands, inflammatory cytokines, angiogenesis, and oxidative stress.",

      "abstract": "Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) causes a devastating bacterial leaf blight in rice. Here, the antimicrobial effects of D-limonene, L-limonene, and its oxidative derivative carveol against Xoo were investigated. We revealed that carveol treatment at ≥ 0.1 mM in liquid culture resulted in significant decrease in Xoo growth rate (> 40%) in a concentration-dependent manner, and over 1 mM, no growth was observed. The treatment with D-limonene and L-limonene also inhibited the Xoo growth but to a lesser extent compared to carveol. These results were further elaborated with the assays of motility, biofilm formation and xanthomonadin production. The carveol treatment over 1 mM caused no motilities, basal level of biofilm formation (< 10%), and significantly reduced xanthomonadin production. The biofilm formation after the treatment with two limonene isomers was decreased in a concentration-dependent manner, but the degree of the effect was not comparable to carveol. In addition, there was negligible effect on the xanthomonadin production mediated by the treatment of two limonene isomers. Field emission-scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) unveiled that all three compounds used in this study cause severe ultrastructural morphological changes in Xoo cells, showing shrinking, shriveling, and holes on their surface. Moreover, quantitative real-time PCR revealed that carveol and D-limonene treatment significantly down-regulated the expression levels of genes involved in virulence and biofilm formation of Xoo, but not with L-limonene. Together, we suggest that limonenes and carveol will be the candidates of interest in the development of biological pesticides.",

Among them, 19 were synthesized and characterized using proton and carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (1H and 13C NMR). For initial compound selection, human melanoma cells (SK-MEL-37) were exposed to a single concentration of a compound (100 μM) for 24, 48, and 72 hours, and cell detachment was visually observed. Cell viability was determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. Nineteen compounds (4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 25, 26, 31, 3', 4', 6', and 9') yielded cell viability below 20%. Subsequently, IC50 values for these compounds were determined, ranging from 11.56 to 55.38 μM, after 72 hours of treatment. Compound 17 (o-hydroxybenzaldehyde (-)-camphene-based thiosemicarbazone) demonstrated the lowest IC50 value, followed by compound 4 (benzaldehyde (-) camphene-based thiosemicarbazone) at 12.84 μM. Regarding compound 4, we observed the induction of a characteristic ladder pattern of DNA fragmentation through gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, fluorescence, flow cytometry and scanning microscopy assays revealed morphological changes consistent with apoptosis induction. Additionally, the measurement of caspase 6 and 8 activity in cellular extracts after treatment for 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours suggested the potential involvement of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway in the mechanism of action of compound 4. Further investigations, including molecular docking studies, are required to fully explore the potential of compound 4 and the other selected compounds, highlighting their promising role in future melanoma therapy research.",

      "abstract": "Although ivermectin (IVM) has a wide spectrum and long half-life, its frequent use as an anthelmintic for the last 42 years led to its worldwide tolerance by Haemonchus contortus. We evaluated the combination of limonene (LIM), a P-glycoprotein (Pgp) modulator, with IVM in lambs infected with a multidrug-resistant H. contortus. Twenty-four male Dorper lambs were artificially infected with two doses (seven days apart) of 8000 infective larvae of a multidrug-resistant isolate of H. contortus. The infection was patent 25 days later. Fifteen days before treatment with IVM (DAY -15), animals were divided into 4 groups: Infected-untreated control (CTL), IVM, LIM, and LIM+IVM. From DAY -15 to DAY + 14, groups LIM and LIM+IVM received 200 mg/kg of body weight/day of LIM via oral. On DAY 0, a single dose of IVM at 200 µg/kg of body weight was administered orally to groups IVM and LIM+IVM. On DAY + 7 and DAY + 14, fecal egg counts (FEC) were performed and on DAY + 14 animals were euthanized for total worm count (TWC), worm length, fecundity of females, and Pgp-9 gene expression. On DAY + 7, group LIM+IVM had 96.29% efficacy based on Fecal Egg Count Reduction TEST (FECRT) and a highly significant reduction in FEC (P = 0.0005) when compared to CTL. On DAY + 14, the efficacy of LIM+IVM was 82.87% on FECRT, although no differences were found among groups for FEC, TWC, worm length, or Pgp-9 gene expression. Female worms from the CTL group had higher egg counts in their uterus when compared to LIM. No differences were found for hematological or biochemical parameters, body weight, or weight gain among groups. Thus, LIM given daily at 200 mg/kg was safe for animals and, when combined with IVM, decreased egg shedding and could reduce pasture contamination, although it was unable to kill multidrug-resistant H. contortus.",

The fish were fed with either a control diet (CTL; no limonene supplementation) or four experimental diets containing 50 (50 L), 100 (100 L), 200 (200 L), and 400 (400 L) mg/kg limonene over a 70-day period, followed by Aeromonas hydrophila challenge. The 200 L treatment resulted in a significant decrease in FCR compared to the CTL treatment. The highest post-challenge mortality was associated with the CTL treatment (62.7%), while the 200 L treatment had the lowest mortality (30.7%). Before the challenge, dietary limonene significantly increased humoral and skin mucosal immune parameters compared to the CTL treatment. The highest leukocyte, lymphocyte counts, skin mucosal protease activity, and intestinal lactic acid bacteria were observed in the 200 L treatment before the challenge. The highest plasma lysozyme activity was observed in the 400 L treatment, whereas the highest skin mucosal lysozyme and peroxidase activities were observed in the 100 L and 200 L treatments before the challenge. There were no significant differences in the blood neutrophil, monocyte, and eosinophil counts, humoral alternative complement activity, skin mucosal alkaline phosphatase activity, and the intestinal total viable bacteria among the treatments before the challenge. After the challenge, the 200 L treatment exhibited the highest leukocyte, neutrophil, and monocyte count, skin mucosal immune parameters, and intestinal lactic acid bacteria, whereas the highest blood eosinophil count was observed in the 100 L, 200 L, and 400 L treatments. At this time, the lowest blood lymphocyte counts were observed in the 100 L and 200 L, but the lowest intestinal total viable bacteria were observed in the 100 L, 200 L, and 400 L treatments. Based on these findings, dietary limonene at 200 mg/kg is ideal for common carp to promote feed efficiency, innate immunity boosting, and resistance against A. hydrophila."

      "abstract": "Long-term exposure to arsenic can lead to testicular damage and lower sperm quality in males, which is mediated by increased arsenic-induced oxidative stress and other damage mechanisms. D-Limonene, which is rich in oranges, lemons, oranges, grapes and other natural fruits, can relieve doxorubicin (DOX)-induced kidney injury and CCL4-induced cardiac toxicity by inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammatory response. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of D-limonene motivate us to further explore whether it can reduce arsenic-induced testicular injury. To verify this scientific hypothesis, testicular pathology, testicular oxidative stress levels and sperm motility were determined after intervention with D-limonene in rats chronically exposed to arsenic. As expected, long-term arsenic exposure caused testicular tissue structure disturbances, increased levels of oxidative stress, and decreased sperm activation, all of which were significantly inhibited due to treatment with D-limonene. In conclusion, our data reveal a previously unproven beneficial effect of D-limonene, namely that D-limonene can inhibit arsenic-induced testicular injury, and also provide theoretical and experimental basis for the application of D-limonene in the treatment of arsenic-induced testicular injury.",

      "abstract": "Citrus is one of the world's most abundant fruits containing vitamins, pigments, and fragrances, making it vital for several industries. However, these fruits contain about 45-50% residues (peels), which often end up as waste and can be harmful to the environment if not properly treated. Bioethanol production from citrus peel waste offers a potential solution to this problem. Hence, this study explores the potential of using ultrasound-assisted pre-treatment method as a novel strategy to extract D-Limonene (essential oil in the residue), and further demonstrates bioethanol production. This was done by investigating ultrasonication's optimal effect on pre-treatment of the citrus residue, followed by bioethanol production. The results show that, optimum values for D-Limonene extraction were obtained at a temperature of 14.6 °C and an ultrasound intensity of 25.81 W/cm2 with a validation yield of 134 ± 4.24 mg/100 g dry CPW. With optimal ultrasonic parameters, the study went further to demonstrate the effect of the essential oil on bioethanol production which is hindered by the oils present. Key findings show better bioethanol yield once the essential oil was extracted (treated) from the citrus waste as opposed to it not extracted (untreated), with a 66 and a 29% increase when comparing simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) and sequential hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) respectively. Based on this result, ultrasound-assisted extraction as a pretreatment method was found suitable for bioethanol production from citrus residue and could be utilized as a biorefinery pre-treatment approach to scale bioethanol production.",

Present study attempts to explore the molecular mechanism about the repellent activity of limonene. When treatment concentration of limonene was 200.00 μg/cm2, the repellent level remained at grade V after 24 hours. Our study showed that limonene could be distinguished by T. confusum antenna with a maximal electroantennography test value of 0.90 mV. Simultaneously, 88 upregulated and 98 downregulated genes were sequenced in limonene-repellent T. confusum, and RT-qPCR analysis showed that four down-regulated and one up-regulated OR genes play an important role in the response to limonene. The repellent rate was decreased by 22.13% mediated with a knockdown of dsTconOR93, while the EAG value of the female and male adults was reduced to 0.26 mV (49.06%) and 0.20 mV (54.05%), respectively. In conclusion, limonene had a strong repellent activity against T. confusum and TconOR93 gene was determined to be a major effector in perception of limonene. This study provides a basis for the development of limonene as a novel botanical pesticide for the control to storage pests, which will reduce the utilization of chemical pesticides and postpone the development of resistance.",

      "abstract": "The main component of orange peel essential oil is limonene. Limonene is a natural active monoterpene with multiple functions, such as antibacterial, antiseptic and antitumor activity, and has important development value in agriculture. This study found that limonene exhibited excellent anti-tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) bioactivity, with results showing that its protection activity, inactivation activity, and curative activity at 800 μg/mL were 84.93%, 59.28%, and 58.89%, respectively-significantly higher than those of chito-oligosaccharides. A direct effect of limonene on TMV particles was not observed, but limonene triggered the hypersensitive response (HR) in tobacco. Further determination of the induction activity of limonene against TMV demonstrated that it displayed good induction activity at 800 μg/mL, with a value of 60.59%. The results of physiological and biochemical experiments showed that at different treatment days, 800 μg/mL limonene induced the enhancement of defense enzymes activity in tobacco, including of SOD, CAT, POD, and PAL, which respectively increased by 3.2, 4.67, 4.12, and 2.33 times compared with the control (POD and SOD activities reached highest on the seventh day, and PAL and CAT activities reached highest on the fifth day). Limonene also enhanced the relative expression levels of pathogenesis related (PR) genes, including NPR1, PR1, and PR5, which were upregulated 3.84-fold, 1.86-fold and 1.71-fold, respectively. Limonene induced the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA), and increased the relative expression levels of genes related to SA biosynthesis (PAL) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst (RBOHB), which respectively increased by 2.76 times and 4.23 times higher than the control. Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is an important plant immune defense against pathogen infection. The observed accumulation of SA, the enhancement of defense enzymes activity and the high-level expression of defense-related genes suggested that limonene may induce resistance to TMV in tobacco by activating SAR mediated by the SA signaling pathway. Furthermore, the experimental results demonstrated that the expression level of the chlorophyll biosynthesis gene POR1 was increased 1.72-fold compared to the control in tobacco treated with 800 μg/mL limonene, indicating that limonene treatment may increase chlorophyll content in tobacco. The results of pot experiment showed that 800 μg/mL limonene induced plant resistance against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (33.33%), Phytophthora capsici (54.55%), Botrytis cinerea (50.00%). The bioassay results indicated that limonene provided broad-spectrum and long-lasting resistance to pathogen infection. Therefore, limonene has good development and utilization value, and is expected to be developed into a new botanical-derived anti-virus agent and plant immunity activator in addition to insecticides and fungicides.",

Loss of dry mass was calculated (n = 10). There was no statistically significant difference in the bond strength between the groups and the most prevalent fracture pattern was the non-adhesive. LIM and LIMBio resulted in more open dentinal tubules. LIM and Bio, whether separate or combined, showed particles of those substances, which decreased in size and number after 6 months. All groups lost mass weight after treatment, with no statistically significant differences between them. Limonene and biosilicate pretreatment did not affect the bond strength to dentin of the universal adhesive system, but resulted in more non-adhesive fractures, even after 6 months.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Arrhythmias are one manifestation of the cardiotoxicity that results from doxorubicin (Doxo) administration. Although cardiotoxicity is an anticipated outcome in anticancer therapies, there is still a lack of treatment options available for its effective management. This study sought to evaluate the possible cardioprotective effect of complex d-limonene (DL) plus hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HβDL) during treatment with Doxo, focusing on the arrhythmic feature. METHODS: Cardiotoxicity was induced in Swiss mice with Doxo 20 mg/kg, with 10 mg/kg of HβDL being administered 30 min before the Doxo. Plasma CK-MB and LDH levels were analyzed. Cellular excitability and susceptibility to cardiac and cardiomyocyte arrhythmias were evaluated using in vivo (pharmacological cardiac stress) and in vitro (burst pacing) ECG protocols. Ca2+ dynamics were also investigated. The expression of CaMKII and its activation by phosphorylation and oxidation were evaluated by western blot, and molecular docking was used to analyze the possible interaction between DL and CaMKII. RESULTS: Electrocardiograms showed that administration of 10 mg/kg of HβDL prevented Doxo-induced widening of the QRS complex and QT interval. HβDL also prevented cardiomyocyte electrophysiological changes that trigger cellular arrhythmias, such as increases in action potential duration and variability; decreased the occurrence of delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) and triggered activities (TAs), and reduced the incidence of arrhythmia in vivo. Ca2+ waves and CaMKII overactivation caused by phosphorylation and oxidation were also decreased. In the in silico study, DL showed potential inhibitory interaction with CaMKII. CONCLUSION: Our results show that 10 mg/kg of βDL protects the heart against Doxo-induced cardiotoxicity arrhythmias, and that this is probably due to its inhibitory effect on CaMKII hyperactivation.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer one of the most common diseases in women, has a high death and morbidity rate. Tamoxifen being very much effective in the chemoprevention of breast cancer has been shown to develop resistance during the course of treatment making it difficult for patient's survival. By combining tamoxifen with naturally occurring substances having similar activities, might control the toxicity and increase the susceptibility towards the treatment. As a natural compound, D-limonene has been reported to inhibit the growth of certain malignancies significantly. The main goal of our work is to investigate the combinatorial antitumor effects of D-limonene and tamoxifen in MCF-7 cells, as well as understand the potential underlying anticancer mechanism. MTT assays, colony formation assays, DAPI and Annexin V-FITC labeling, flow cytometer analysis, and western blot analysis were used to explore the details of anticancer mechanism. The combined effects of tamoxifen with D-limonene have shown significant decrease in the cell viability of MCF 7 cells. According to flow cytometer analyses and Annexin V/PI staining, D-limonene has been found to increase tamoxifen-mediated apoptosis as compared to the treatment alone in these cells. Additionally, cell growth has been found to be arrested at G1 phase by regulating cyclin D1 and cyclin B1. Our research consequently provided the first evidence that combining D-limonene and tamoxifen might increase the anticancer efficacy by inducing apoptosis in MCF 7 breast cancer cells. This combinatorial treatment strategy demands more research which might fulfill the need for improved treatment efficacy in controlling breast cancer.",

      "abstract": "Atherosclerosis, a leading cause of mortality worldwide, is driven by multiple risk factors such as diabetes. Oxidative stress and inflammation assist interrelated roles in diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis. Thereby, treatment of diabetic atherosclerosis from an oxidative stress/inflammatory perspective seems to be a more effective modality to prevent and delay plaque formation and progression. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of l-limonene (LMN) on oxidative stress/inflammatory responses in the aortic artery of diabetic atherosclerosis-modeled rats. Male Wistar rats (n = 30, 250-280 g, 12 weeks old) were used to establish a diabetic atherosclerosis model (8 weeks) using high-fat diet/low-dose streptozotocin. LMN (200 mg/kg/day) was administered orally, starting on day 30th before tissue sampling. Plasma lipid profiles, aortic histopathological changes, atherogenic index, aortic artery levels of oxidative stress markers (manganese superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and 8-isoprostane), inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10), and expression of phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK)/AMPK, Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), and p-p65/p65 proteins were evaluated. The administration of LMN to diabetic rats improved lipid profiles, aortic histopathological morphology, and atherogenic index (P < 0.05 to P < 0.001). It also increased enzymatic antioxidant activities, decreased 8-isoprostane level, suppressed inflammatory response, upregulated p-AMPK and SIRT1 proteins, and downregulated p-p65 protein (P < 0.05 to P < 0.01). Inhibiting the AMPK through the administration of compound C significantly abolished or reversed the positive effects of LMN in diabetic rats (P < 0.05 to P < 0.01). LMN treatment had dual anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory actions against atherosclerosis in the aortic artery of diabetic rats. Atheroprotection by LMN was mediated partly through modulation of AMPK/SIRT1/p65 nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway. LMN appears to be a promising anti-atherosclerotic modality to improve the quality of life in diabetic patients.",

      "abstract": "Leishmaniasis is a tropical zoonotic disease. It is found in 98 countries, with an estimated 1.3 million people being affected annually. During the life cycle, the Leishmania parasite alternates between promastigote and amastigote forms. The first line treatment for leishmaniasis are the pentavalent antimonials, such as N-methylglucamine antimoniate (Glucantime®) and sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam®). These drugs are commonly related to be associated with dangerous side effects such as cardiotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and pancreatitis. Considering these aspects, this work aimed to obtain a new series of limonene-acylthiosemicarbazides hybrids as an alternative for the treatment of leishmaniasis. For this, promastigotes, axenic amastigotes, and intracellular amastigotes of Leishmania amazonensis were used in the antiproliferative assay; J774-A1 macrophages for the cytotoxicity assay; and electron microscopy techniques were performed to analyze the morphology and ultrastructure of parasites. ATZ-S-04 compound showed the best result in both tests. Its IC50 , in promastigotes, axenic amastigotes and intracellular amastigotes was 0.35±0.08 μM, 0.49±0.06 μM, and 15.90±2.88 μM, respectively. Cytotoxicity assay determined a CC50 of 16.10±1.76 μM for the same compound. By electron microscopy, it was observed that ATZ-S-04 affected mainly the Golgi complex, in addition to morphological changes in promastigote forms of L. amazonensis.",

      "abstract": "Food security is an important basis and guarantee to national safety, the loss caused by storage pests was a serious problem which affects the food security widely. Frequent application of chemical pesticides caused several critical crises including the development of resistance, pesticide residues, environmental pollution, and exposure risk to human or non-target organisms. The utilization of volatile components acts as a natural alternative for controlling storage pests has aroused extensive interest in recent years. It has been reported that terpinene-4-ol and limonene showed significant insecticidal activity against Sitophilus zeamais in our previous studies, which was evaluated to have strong influences to CYP450 genes. To determine the links and roles of related genes, we identified the SzCYP6MS subfamily genes which encoded a putative protein of 493 or 494 amino acids. Then, the expression of four CYP6MS subfamily genes were increased significantly under the fumigation stress by terpinen-4-ol and limonene, which was determined by the RT-qPCR analysis compared with non-fumigated colonies. In addition, we determined that RNAi-mediated CYP6MS genes knockdown significantly increased the sensitivity of S. zeamais to terpinen-4-ol and limonene, the mortality rates of insects with knocked down CYP6MS1, CYP6MS5, CYP6MS6, CYP6MS8, and CYP6MS9 genes increased by 25%, 25%, 16%, 17%, and 4% in terpinen-4-ol treatment groups and by 29%, 25%, 15%, 22%, and 3% in limonene treatment groups compared with that in the control groups, respectively. Finally, it was validated that CYP6MS5 exhibited the most stable binding with terpinen-4-ol that was similar to the result between CYP6MS8 and limonene which were verified by molecular docking analysis. In together, this study demonstrates the potential of terpinen-4-ol and limonene used as novel botanical pesticides to control storage pests, thereby reducing application of chemical pesticides and postponing resistance development.",

Limonene (LMN), a naturally occurring monoterpene, is found ubiquitously in citrus fruits and peels. There is enormous interest in finding novel therapeutic agents that can cure or halt the progressive degeneration in PD; therefore, the main aim of this study is to investigate the potential neuroprotective effects of LMN employing a rodent model of PD measuring parameters of oxidative stress, neuro-inflammation, and apoptosis to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. PD in experimental rats was induced by intraperitoneal injection of ROT (2.5 mg/kg) five days a week for a total of 28 days. The rats were treated with LMN (50 mg/kg, orally) along with intraperitoneal injection of ROT (2.5 mg/kg) for the same duration as in ROT-administered rats. ROT injections induced a significant loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and DA striatal fibers following activation of glial cells (astrocytes and microglia). ROT treatment enhanced oxidative stress, altered NF-κB/MAPK signaling and motor dysfunction, and enhanced the levels/expressions of inflammatory mediators and proinflammatory cytokines in the brain. There was a concomitant mitochondrial dysfunction followed by the activation of the Hippo signaling and intrinsic pathway of apoptosis as well as altered mTOR signaling in the brain of ROT-injected rats. Oral treatment with LMN corrected the majority of the biochemical, pathological, and molecular parameters altered following ROT injections. Our study findings demonstrate the efficacy of LMN in providing protection against ROT-induced neurodegeneration.",

In this study, limonene was solid encapsulated into V6-starch under ambient pressure (AP) and high hydrostatic pressure (HHP). The maximum loading capacity reached 639.0 mg/g after HHP treatment, and the highest encapsulation efficiency was 79.9 %. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) results showed that the ordered structure of V6-starch was ameliorated with limonene, which avoided the reduction of the space between adjacent helices within V6-starch generated by HHP treatment. Notably, HHP treatment may force molecular permeation of limonene from amorphous regions into inter-crystalline amorphous regions and crystalline regions as the Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) patterns indicated, leading to better controlled-release behavior. Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) revealed that the solid encapsulation of V-type starch improved the thermal stability of limonene. Further, the release kinetics study showed that a complex prepared with a mass ratio of 2:1 under HHP treatment sustainably released limonene over 96 h and exhibited a preferable antimicrobial effect, which could extend the shelf life of strawberries.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: PM2.5 exposure is associated with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), but the mechanism is unclear. The lack of understanding impedes our effort on prevention. This study examined a possible mechanism of lung cancer caused by PM2.5 exposure, and aimed to find a potential intervention for people living in PM2.5 polluted regions. METHODS: Electron microscopy and oil-red staining were conducted to examine the lipid droplet accumulation. Masson's trichrome staining, colony forming, scratch assay and transwell experiment were conducted to evaluate the effect of PM2.5 exposure and D-limonene intervention on the occurrence and progression of LUAD. Potential intervention targets were found by RNA-Seq and verified by luciferase reporter assay. MiR-195 KO mice constructed with CRISPR/Cas9 technology were used to investigate the pivotal role of D-limonene-miR-195-SREBP1/FASN axis. Cohort analysis of lung cancer patients, human LUAD tissues staining and human intervention trial were also conducted to validate the results of cell and animal experiments. RESULTS: Our results showed that PM2.5 exposure induced accumulation of lipid droplets in LUAD cells which accompanied by increased malignant cellular behaviors. PM2.5 exposure led to cleaved N-SREBP1 translocation into nucleus, which activated the de novo lipogenesis pathway. Same changes were also observed in normal lung epithelial cells and normal lung tissue, and mice developed pulmonary fibrosis after long-term exposure to PM2.5. Furthermore, in a cohort of 11,712 lung cancer patients, significant lipid metabolism disorders were observed in higher PM2.5 polluted areas. In view of that, D-limonene was found to inhibit the changes in lipid metabolism through upregulating the expression of miR-195, which inhibited the expression of lipogenic genes (SREBF1/FASN/ACACA) specifically. And a small human intervention trial showed that serum miR-195 was upregulated after oral intake of D-limonene. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal a new mechanism of pulmonary fibrosis and LUAD that is related to PM2.5 exposure-induced lipid droplet accumulation. We also demonstrate that D-limonene-miR-195-SREBP1/FASN axis is a potential preventive intervention for mediating the progression and development of LUAD induced by PM2.5 exposure.

Doxorubicin (DOX) is an important anti-neoplastic anthracycline chemotherapeutic drug widely described. However, it suffers from serious dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. d-Limonene is a major constituent of numerous citrus oils that is considered a specific monoterpene against free radicals producing antioxidant activity. Herein, we aimed to design three types of self-assembled nanodelivery systems (nanoemulsion, niosomes, and polylactide nanoparticles) for loading both DOX and d-limonene to enhance the solubilization of d-limonene and provide antioxidant activity with excellent anticancer activity. As confirmed by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy, the nanoparticles were prepared successfully with diameter sizes of 52, 180, and 257 nm for the DOX-loaded nanoemulsion, niosomes, and polylactide nanoparticles, respectively. The zeta potential values were above -30 mV in all cases, which confirms the formation of stable nanoparticles. The loading efficiency of DOX was the highest in the case of the DOX-loaded nanoemulsion (75.8%), followed by niosomes (62.8%), and the least was in the case of polylactide nanoparticles with a percentage of 50.2%. The in vitro release study of the DOX-loaded nanoparticles showed a sustained release profile of doxorubicin with the highest release in the case of DOX-loaded PDLLA nanoparticles. The kinetic release model for all developed nanoparticles was the Peppas-Sahlin model, demonstrating DOX release through Fickian diffusion phenomena. Moreover, all developed nanoparticles maintain the antioxidant activity of d-limonene. The cytotoxicity study of the DOX-loaded nanoparticles showed concentration-dependent anticancer activity with excellent anticancer activity in the case of the DOX-loaded nanoemulsion and polylactide nanoparticles. These nanoparticles will be further studied in vivo to prove the cardioprotective effect of d-limonene in combination with DOX."

The cell cytotoxicity of the prepared forms of DL/DLN was investigated using skin cell lines. In vitro and ex vivo bioassays were applied on lice. The ex vivo bioassay was done on cut feathers containing lice eggs. The in vivo experiment was conducted on pigeons naturally infested by lice. The infested pigeons were treated with DL, DLN, or deltamethrin (D) as a positive control. Both forms of D-limonene were found to be safe when applied to the normal human skin fibroblast cell line, but DLN was toxic to skin cell carcinoma. The in vitro and ex vivo results of both DL and DLN forms were similar. All eggs treated with DL, DLN, and D failed to hatch (100%). The in vivo results showed complete elimination of lice 24 h post-treatment (PT), and biochemical analysis showed that the treated birds retained normal kidney and liver functions. Treated groups also showed improved productivity in the 4 months PT. In conclusion, DL and DLN are safe and effective in controlling feather lice infestation in pigeons and successful treatment encourages bird productivity.",

      "abstract": "The quest for different natural compounds for different biomedical applications especially in the treatment of cancer is at a high pace with increasing incidence of severity. D-limonene has been portrayed as one of the effective potential candidate centered to the context of breast cancer. The anticipation of its count as an effective biomedical agent required a detailed understanding of their molecular mechanism of biocompatibility. This study elucidates the mechanistic action of D-limonene channelized by the induction of apoptosis for controlling proliferation in breast cancer cells. The possible mechanism was explored through an experimental and computational approach to estimate cell proliferation inhibition, cell cycle phase distribution, apoptosis analysis using a flow cytometry, western blotting and molecular docking. The results showed reduced dose and time-dependent viability of MCF7 cells. The study suggested the arrest of the cell cycle at G2/M phase leading to apoptosis and other discrepancies of molecular activity mediated via significant alteration in protein expression pattern of anti-apoptotic proteins like Cyclin B1 and CDK1. Computational analysis showed firm interaction of D-limonene with Cyclin B1 and CDK1 proteins influencing their structural and functional integrity indicating the mediation of mechanism. This study concluded that D-limonene suppresses the proliferation of breast cancer cells by inducing G2/M phase arrest via deregulation of Cyclin B1/CDK1.",

      "abstract": "Long term exposure to solar ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation is one of the primary factors of premature skin aging and is referred to as photoaging. Also, mammalian skin exposed to UVB triggers an increase in production of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), which is critically involved in the pathogenesis of hyperpigmentary skin diseases. This study investigated the protective effect of limonene on UVB-induced photodamage and photoaging in immortalized human skin keratinocytes (HaCaT) in vitro. Initially, we determined cell viability and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in UVB-irradiated HaCaT cells. Pretreatment with limonene increased cell viability followed by inhibition of intracellular ROS generation in UVB-irradiated HaCaT cells. Interestingly, the antioxidative activity of limonene was directly correlated with an increase in expression of endogenous antioxidants, including heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1), and γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCLC), which was associated with enhanced nuclear translocation and activation of NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2). Indeed, Nrf2 knockdown reduced limonene's protective effects. Additionally, we observed that limonene treatment inhibited UVB-induced α-MSH secretion followed by inhibition of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) via suppression of p53 transcriptional activation. Moreover, limonene prevented UVB-mediated depletion of tight junction regulatory proteins, including occludin and zonula occludens-1. On the other hand, limonene treatment significantly decreased matrix metalloproteinase-2 levels in UVB-irradiated HaCaT cells. Based on these results, limonene may have a dermato-protective effect in skin cells by activating the Nrf2-dependent cellular antioxidant defense system.",

      "abstract": "Concentration is a key determinant in the overall positive impact of terpenes on milk and cheese aroma; additionally, route of intake may affect the achievable concentrations of dietary terpenes in milk and cheese. In this study, we explored the possibility that the amount of the monoterpene limonene transferred to sheep milk and its corresponding cheese could differ depending on the route of intake and that the aroma profile of these products could also differ. To this aim, 12 lactating dairy ewes were repeatedly exposed to limonene by the oral or respiratory route during a 48-h test period, according to a 3 × 3 Latin square experimental design. Limonene content was measured in individual and bulk milk samples, in 1-d-old and 15-d-old Caciotta cheese obtained from that milk, in the related whey and curd, and in the air inhaled by the ewes in the respiratory treatment group (to obtain an estimate of the dose actually supplied by this route). Bulk milk and fresh (1-d-old) cheese underwent sensory analysis by ortho-olfactory evaluation. Both intake routes demonstrated transfer of limonene to milk, but the respiratory route transferred limonene with greater efficiency than the oral route. Moreover, according to the protocol used in this study, a short period of respiratory exposure induced a slightly higher limonene content in milk compared with oral exposure. As to the fate of limonene during cheesemaking, an important part of it was lost into the whey, perhaps through volatilization. The differences between milk and cheese tended to dissipate in curd and fresh cheese and disappeared completely after 15 d of ripening. Finally, it was possible to distinguish between the 2 routes of limonene intake using sensory analysis, even though no direct relationship was identified between the different aroma profiles of milks and cheeses from the oral and respiratory groups and their respective limonene contents. Overall, our results expand current knowledge on the biological pathways of terpene transfer from feed to sheep milk and cheese, as well as on the role played by terpenes in the formation of aroma in these products. Our observations may contribute to future development of strategies for external control and better standardization of the presence of odor compounds in milk and cheese from dairy ruminants.",

      "abstract": "A route based on pyrolysis and physical activation with H2O and CO2 was proposed to reuse citrus waste traditionally discarded. The citrus wastes were orange peel (OP), mandarine peel (MP), rangpur lime peel (RLP), and sweet lime peel (SLP). The main aim was to use the solid products of this new route as adsorbents for Cu(II) ions. Copper ions are among the most important water pollutants due to their non-degradability, toxicity, and bioaccumulation, facilitating their inclusion and long persistence in the food chain. Besides the solid products, the liquid and gaseous fractions were evaluated for possible applications. Results showed that the citrus waste composition favored the thermochemical treatment. In addition, the following yields were obtained from the pyrolysis process: approximately 30 % wt. of biochar, 40 % wt. of non-condensable gases, and 30 % wt. of bio-oil. The biochars did not present a high specific surface area. Nevertheless, activated carbons with CO2 and H2O presented specific surface areas of 212.4 m2/g and 399.4 m2/g, respectively, and reached Cu(II) adsorption capacities of 28.2 mg g-1 and 27.8 mg g-1. The adsorption kinetic study revealed that the equilibrium was attained at 60 min and the pseudo-second-order model presented a better fit to the experimental data. The main generated gases were CO2, which could be employed as an activating agent for activated carbon production. d-limonene, used for food and medicinal purposes, was the main constituent of the bio-oil.",

Also, the OPW feeds reshaped the microbial community and enriched fermentative bacteria, especially those saccharolytic ones (i.e. Prevotella-7).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Frequent application of chemical fumigants has contributed to the development of resistance in stored-product pests. Essential oils provide a novel and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional chemical pesticides. In this work, the fumigant activity of Taxodium 'zhongshansha' essential oil (TZEO) and main active components against Sitophilus zeamais were evaluated. In addition, the molecular mechanisms mediating the fumigant activity of limonene were assessed. RESULTS: TZEO showed strong fumigant activity against Sitophilus zeamais, with a 50% lethal concentration (LC50 ) of 22.90 μL L-1 air in 24 h. The main components of TZEO were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, the main active ingredient (limonene) showed an LC50 of 9.93 μL L-1 air in 24 h which had a serious dose-time-effect. The LC50 value of the positive control (aluminum phosphide) was 1.91 μL L-1 . In total, 3982 up-regulated and 3067 down-regulated genes were sequenced in limonene-fumigated Sitophilus zeamais, the genes related to metabolic detoxification were significantly enriched. The mortality rate of 7 day-old Sitophilus zeamais adult mediated with knockdown of SzCYP6MS5 and SzCYP6MS6 raised up to 65.67% and 67.65% after fumigation with limonene in 24 h, respectively. The results showed that SzCYP6MS5 and SzCYP6MS6 are closely involved to the detoxification of limonene. CONCLUSION: In this study, candidate genes affected by limonene treatment in Sitophilus zeamais were identified. These findings provided insights into the systemic metabolic response of Sitophilus zeamais to limonene and established a basis for the development of limonene as a botanical pesticide for the control of stored-product pests. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with high mortality rates, despite the fact that there are therapies available. Importantly, excessive oxidative stress may contribute to ischemia/reperfusion injury leading to death related to MI. In this scenario, naturally occurring antioxidant compounds are an important source of possible therapeutic intervention. Thus, this study sought to elucidate the mechanisms of cardioprotection of s-limonene in an isoproterenol-induced MI animal model. METHODS: Wistar rats were treated with 1 mg/kg s-limonene (SL) or 100 mg/kg N-acetylcysteine (NAC, positive control) once, 30 min after isoproterenol-induced MI (applied in two doses with a 24 h interval). The protective effects of SL in the heart were examined via the serum level of creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB), electrocardiographic profile, infarct size and histological parameters. Using isolated cardiomyocytes, we also assessed calcium transient amplitude, cytosolic and mitochondrial oxidative stress and the expression of proteins related to oxidative stress. RESULTS: SL at a concentration of 1 mg/kg attenuated isoproterenol-induced MI injury, by preventing ST-segment elevation and QTc prolongation in the ECG. SL reduced the infarct size and collagen content in cardiac tissue. At the cellular level, SL prevented increased Ca2+, associated with attenuation of cytosolic and mitochondrial oxidative stress. These changes resulted in a reduction of the oxidized form of Ca2+ Calmodulin-Dependent Kinase II (CaMKII) and restored superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity. CONCLUSION: Our data show that s-limonene promotes cardioprotection against MI injury, probably through inhibition of increased Ca2+ and attenuation of oxidative stress via CaMKII.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect and mode of action of lemon essential oil (LEO), and its main active component, d-limonene, with different doses on intestinal inflammation of mice. Sixty-four 5-week-old male balb/c mice weighing 22.0 ± 1.5 g were randomly assigned into one of 8 treatments (n = 8/treatment), including normal saline group (NS), Escherichia coli (E. coli) group, and either LEO and d-limonene essential oil (DEO) group supplemented at 300, 600, and 1,200 mg/kg of BW, respectively. After the pre-feeding period, the mice were fasted for 12 h, the mice in the NS group and the E. coli group were gavaged with normal saline, and the mice in the LEO group and DEO group were gavaged with respective dose of EOs for 1 week. One hour after the end of gavage on the 7th day, except that the mice in the normal saline group were intraperitoneally injected with normal saline, the mice in the other groups were intraperitoneally injected with the same concentration of E. coli (108 cfu/ml, 0.15 ml per mouse). The antioxidant indexes were measured including superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in plasma obtained by taking blood from mouse eyeballs. The inflammatory indexes were measured including interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in plasma. The tight junction protein indicators were tested include zona occludens 1 protein (ZO-1), occludin and claudin in mouse duodenum. We found that all of the above indexes for E. coli group were different (P< 0.05) with the NS group. The interaction of EO and dose (E × D) were significant (P < 0.01) for all of the indexes. In addition, LEO at 300 mg/kg BW and DEO at 600 mg/kg BW had better antioxidant and anti-inflammation activity on the infected mice, which reduced (P < 0.05) the plasma concentrations of MDA, MPO, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, but increased (P < 0.01) the concentrations of SOD. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining of duodenum observation showed that LEO and DEO reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and maintain the orderly arrangement of epithelial cells. Moreover, supplementation of LEO at 600 mg/kg and DEO at 300 mg/kg BW alleviated (P < 0.05) intestinal barrier injury for increasing the relative expression of ZO-1, occludin and claudin mRNA in mice duodenum. These results showed that the pre-treatment with LEO and DEO had protection of intestinal tissue and inflammation in E. coli infected mice. Both LEO and DEO exhibited activity of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and alleviating intestinal injury, whereas, compared with DEO, LEO can be active at a lower dosage. Furthermore, as the main active component of LEO, the d-limonene appeared to play not only the major role, but also the joint action with other active components of LEO."

Most medications for treating IBS, including spasmolytics, laxatives, and antidiarrheals, have low efficacy. Effective and safe therapeutic treatments have yet to be developed for IBS. PURPOSE: This study assessed the efficacy and safety of a food supplement containing standardized menthol, limonene, and gingerol in human participants with IBS or IBS/functional dyspepsia (FD). DESIGN: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: We randomly assigned 56 patients with IBS or IBS/FD to an intervention group (Group 1) or control group (Group 2) that were given supplement or placebo, respectively, in addition to the standard treatment regimen for 30 d. Three outpatient visits were conducted during the study. Symptom severity was measured at each visit using a 7×7 questionnaire. Qualitative and quantitative composition of the intestinal microbiota were assessed at visits 1 and 3 based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing. RESULTS: At visit 1 (before treatment), the median total 7×7 questionnaire score was in the moderately ill range for both groups, with no difference between the groups (p = 0.1). At visit 2, the total 7×7 score decreased to mildly ill, with no difference between the groups (p = 0.4). At visit 3, the total score for group 1 indicated borderline illness and for group 2 remained indicated mild illness (p = 0.009). Even though we observed some variations in gut microbiota between the groups, we did not find any statistically significant changes. CONCLUSION: The food supplement with standardized menthol, limonene, and gingerol content increased the efficacy of standard therapy in IBS and FD patients. The use of the supplement did not cause any obvious side effects. REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04484467.",

The aim of this paper was to verify if limonene accumulates in meat after oral or respiratory exposure and to assess its effects on animal oxidative status and meat quality. Thirty-six goat kids were involved and assigned for 1 week to three treatment groups: control group (CG); an oral group (OG), where limonene was administered directly into the mouth (drenched); and a respiratory group (RG), in which limonene was administered via inhalation. The meat limonene concentration for the OG was the highest (P < 0.01), although RG showed the highest rate of transfer (P < 0.001). Limonene gives the possibility to delay lipid oxidative processes, reducing discoloration and rancidity in meat. However, the respiration route seems to be able to guarantee a greater limonene transfer into meat compared to the oral one.",

      "abstract": "Limonene (1-methyl-4-(1-methylethenyl)-cyclohexene) is one of the most widespread monocyclic terpenes, being both a natural and industrial compound. It is widely present in the environment, including in water supplies. Therefore, it may be subjected to aqueous chlorination at water treatment stations during drinking water preparation. Besides, being a component of numerous body care and cosmetic products, it may present at high levels in swimming pool waters and could also be subjected to aqueous chlorination. Laboratory experiments with aqueous chlorination of D-limonene demonstrated the prevalence of the conjugated electrophilic addition of HOCl molecule to the double bonds of the parent molecule as the primary reaction. The reaction obeys the Markovnikov rule, as the levels of the corresponding products were higher than those of the alternative ones. Fragmentation pattern in conditions of electron ionization enabled the assigning of the structures for four primary products. The major products of the chlorination are formed by the addition of two HOCl molecules to limonene. The reactions of electrophilic addition are usually accompanied by the reactions of elimination. Thus, the loss of water molecules from the products of various generations results in the reproduction of the double bond, which immediately reacts further. Thus, a cascade of addition-elimination reactions brings the most various isomeric polychlorinated species. At a ratio of limonene/active chlorine higher than 1:10, the final products of aqueous chlorination (haloforms) start forming, while brominated haloforms represent a notable portion of these products due to the presence of bromine impurities in the used NaOCl. It is worth mentioning that the bulk products of aqueous chlorination are less toxic in the bioluminescence test on V. fischeri than the parent limonene.",

Freezing ensures the inactivation of viable Anisakis larvae; however, since it affects the organoleptic properties of food, essential oils and their compounds were proposed as an alternative. In this study, fresh anchovy fillets were experimentally parasitized with L3 Anisakis larvae to test the anisakicidal efficacy of R (+) limonene (LMN) in marinated fishery products. The anisakicidal effectiveness and organoleptic influence of several LMN concentrations (0.5%, 1%, and 5%) were tested during the marinating process (MS) and storage in sunflower seed oil (SO) of marinated anchovy fillets. Double treatment (DT) with 1% LMN was also performed both during marination and subsequent storage in oil. MS treatment resulted only in a reduction in larvae viability after 48 h, while a complete inactivation was observed in SO after 8, 10, and 20 days of treatment with 5%, 1%, and 0.5% LMN, respectively. DT was the most effective with complete larval inactivation after 7 days. Only 5% LMN influenced the sensory characteristics of the fillets, resulting, however, in a pleasant lemon-like odor and taste. Considering the results obtained, LMN might be a suitable natural alternative to manage Anisakis risk in the fishery industry."

Dermal and/or transdermal delivery of LAs has other advantages, such as sustained drug delivery and decreased systemic adverse effects. This study reports the development of poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles coated with chitosan for the sustained release and topicality of benzocaine (BZC) and topical delivery. BZC PLGA nanoparticles or nonencapsulated drugs were further incorporated into Poloxamer hydrogels (Pluronic™ F-127). The nanoparticles showed a mean diameter of 380 ± 4 nm, positive zeta potential after coating with chitosan (23.3 ± 1.7 mV), and high encapsulation efficiency (96.7 ± 0.02%). Cellular viability greater than 70% for both fibroblasts and keratinocytes was observed after treatment with nanoparticles, which is in accordance with the preconized guidelines for biomedical devices and delivery systems. Both the nanoparticles and hydrogels were able to modulate BZC delivery and increase drug permeation when compared to the nonencapsulated drug. Furthermore, the incorporation of limonene into hydrogels containing BZC-loaded nanoparticles increased the BZC permeation rates. Non-Newtonian and pseudoplastic behaviors were observed for all hydrogel nanoformulations with or without nanoparticles. These results demonstrate that the hydrogel-nanoparticle hybrids could be a promising delivery system for prolonged local anesthetic therapy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Biofilms have been found growing on implantable medical devices. This can lead to persistent clinical infections. The highly antibiotic-resistant property of biofilms necessitates the search for both potent antimicrobial agents and novel antibiofilm strategies. Natural product-based anti-biofilm agents were found to be as efficient as chemically synthesized counterparts with fewer side effects. In the present study, the effects of limonene as an antibiofilm agent were evaluated on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formed on different surfaces using the CDC model system in continuous flow. The flgK gene and the pilA gene expression in P. aeruginosa, and the icaA gene and eno gene in S. aureus, which could be considered as efficient resistance markers, were studied. METHODS: Mono- and dual-species biofilms were grown on polycarbonate, polypropylene, and stainless-steel coupons in a CDC biofilm reactor (Biosurface Technologies, Bozeman, MT, USA). To evaluate the ability of limonene to inhibit and eradicate biofilm, a sub-MIC concentration (10 mL/L) was tested. The gene expression of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus was detected by SYBR Green quantitative Real-Time PCR assay (Meridiana Bioline, Brisbane, Australia). RESULTS: The limonene added during the formation of biofilms at sub-MIC concentrations works very well in inhibiting biofilms on all three materials, reducing their growth by about 2 logs. Of the same order of magnitude is the ability of limonene to eradicate both mono- and polymicrobial mature biofilms on all three materials. Greater efficacy was observed in the polymicrobial biofilm on steel coupons. The expression of some genes related to the virulence of the two microorganisms was differently detected in mono- and polymicrobial biofilm. CONCLUSIONS: These data showed that the limonene treatment expressed different levels of biofilm-forming genes, especially when both types of strains alone and together grew on different surfaces. Our findings showed that limonene treatment is also very efficient when biofilm has been grown under shear stress causing significant and irreversible damage to the biofilm structure. The effectiveness of the sanitation procedures can be optimized by applying antimicrobial combinations with natural compounds (e.g., limonene).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic orofacial pain is a serious public health problem with a prevalence of 7-11% in the population. This disorder has different etiologies and characteristics that make pharmacological treatment difficult. Natural products have been shown to be a promising source of treatments for the management of chronic pain, as an example the terpenes. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of one of these terpenes, d-limonene (LIM - a common monoterpene found in citrus fruits) alone and complexed with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (LIM/HPβCD) in preclinical animal models. METHODS: Orofacial pain was induced by the administration of hypertonic saline on the corneal surface, the injection of formalin into the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), or chronic constriction injury of the infraorbital nerve (CCI-IoN). The study used male Wistar rats and Swiss mice treated with LIM (50 mg/kg), LIM/HPβCD (50 mg/kg), vehicle (control), gabapentin or morphine, and eyes wiping (induced by hypertonic saline), face rubbing (formalin-induced in TMJ) or mechanical hyperalgesia (provoked by CCI-IoN) were assessed. Additionally, ELISA was used to measure TNF-α, and western blot analysis to assess levels of PKAcα, NFκB, p38MAPK and phosphorylated PKC substrates. Serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transferase (ALT) were also evaluated. RESULTS: LIM and LIM/HPβCD significantly reduced (p < 0.001) corneal nociception and formalin-induced TMJ nociception. In addition, both substances attenuated (p < 0.001) mechanical hyperalgesia in the CCI-IoN model. The antinociceptive effect induced by LIM and HPβCD/LIM was associated with decreased TNF-α levels, downregulation of the NFκB and p38MAPK signalling pathways and reduced PKC substrate phosphorylation and PKA immunocontent. Moreover, the results demonstrated that complexation with HPβCD was able to decrease the therapeutic dose of LIM. CONCLUSION: LIM was found to be a promising molecule for the treatment of orofacial pain due to its capacity to modulate some important mediators essential to the establishment of pain, and HPβCD can be a key tool to improve the profile of LIM.",

      "abstract": "Microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC), or microbial biocorrosion, is caused directly by microbial metabolic activities/products or induced by microbial biofilm's damage of a protective film that exposes a solid surface to a pre-existing corrosive environment. MIC causes billions of dollars of losses in various industrial processes, especially in oil and gas and water utilities. The mitigation of problematic industrial microbes typically relies on biocides whose discharges can cause environmental problems. Thus, more effective biocide applications are desired to minimize environmental impact. D-Limonene, a citrus peel oil, generally regarded as safe (GRAS), was used to enhance the popular biodegradable tetrakis hydroxymethyl phosphonium sulfate (THPS) biocide. An oilfield mixed-culture biofilm was grown anaerobically in enriched artificial seawater containing C1018 carbon steel coupons for 7 days at 37 °C. One hundred ppm (w/w) D-limonene reduced general heterotrophic bacteria (GHB) and acid-producing bacteria (APB) effectively, leading to 5.4-log and 6.0-log reductions in sessile GHB and APB cell counts, respectively, compared to no treatment control. The combination of 100 ppm D-limonene + 100 ppm THPS achieved extra 1.0-log SRB, 0.6-log GHB and 0.5-log APB reductions in sessile cell counts, which led to extra 58% reduction in microbial corrosion mass loss (1.2 vs. 0.5 mg/cm2) and extra 30% reductions in maximum pit depth (11.5 vs. 8.1 µm), compared to 100 ppm THPS-only treatment. Linear polarization resistance and potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) corrosion data supported mass loss and pitting data. Mixed-culture biofilms on carbon steel coupons after 7 day incubation at 37 °C showing enhanced biocide treatment outcome using D-limonene + THPS: A no treatment, B 100 ppm D-limonene, C 100 ppm THPS, D 100 ppm D-limonene + 100 ppm THPS.",

A total of 828 weaned piglets were distributed into 36 pens (23 pigs/pen) and assigned to three dietary pair choice feeding options (n = 12): unsupplemented prestarter diets (reference) versus reference plus D-limonene, trans-anethole, or eucalyptol. Piglets showed a preference for diets with D-limonene (53.8%) and trans-anethole (54.5%), and an aversion to eucalyptol (41.6%) (p < 0.05). Exp. 2 studied whether the prenatal and perinatal exposure to D-limonene, trans-anethole, and eucalyptol influences the feed intake and growth of newly-weaned piglets. Twenty-eight gestating and lactating sows were distributed into two dietary treatments (n = 14): unsupplemented Control diets or Control plus a blend of BCs (BBC; containing D-limonene, trans-anethole, and eucalyptol). D-limonene, trans-anethole, and eucalyptol were transferred into the placental fluid, and D-limonene and trans-anethole into the milk (p < 0.05). Furthermore, weanling piglets (n = 200; Control) and (n = 203; BBC) received the same treatment as their mothers in prestarter diets. The early response after weaning showed that piglets' post-weaning BW gain was higher in the Control (p < 0.05) group than in those exposed to BBC. In conclusion, prenatal exposure to preferred D-limonene and trans-anethole, or familiarity to eucalyptol did not help to overcome the innate aversion to eucalyptol and its negative effect on weanling piglets' BW."

Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the gene expression signature that would potentially stratify lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients who may benefit from d-limonene intervention, thus facilitating the development of newer treatment strategies for LUAD. In total, 1877 significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. These genes were mainly associated with the metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides, lipid metabolism, endocrine system, carbohydrate metabolism, and cell growth and death pathways. Three genes, including antioncogenes FZD3 and MTURN, and oncogene PRC1, which were regulated by d-limonene were identified based on survival analysis of TCGA-LUAD data and were validated by both in vitro and in vivo experiments. High-risk patients screened by the model exhibited a significantly poor prognosis. In conclusion, three gene expression signatures (FZD3, MTURN, and PRC1) were validated by both in vitro and in vivo experiments and identified to help stratify candidate lung adenocarcinoma patients who may benefit from d-limonene intervention. Although further studies are warranted, this study highlighted a potential strategy to improve the treatment outcomes of LUAD patients.",

The R-limonene (LC50 of 27 ppm) and control groups were analyzed 12 and 24 h after the beginning of treatments. The midgut of the control larvae was composed of cylindrical and elongated cells with a spherical and central nucleus and regenerative cells with a pyramidal shape. After 12 h of treatment, columnar cells, protuberances, and cytoplasmic vacuolization were found. However, 24 h after treatment, complete disorganization of the epithelium was observed. There was a positive reaction in all treatments for the presence of glycogen. However, the midgut of larvae treated with R-limonene showed higher levels. For the total protein, positive marking occurred in all groups evaluated, with higher levels in treatments and the lowest in control 12 h. The levels of total protein and glycogen increased in the treated larvae compared to the 12 h control. Besides, a reduction in total sugar levels was observed in the treated larvae compared to controls 12 and 24 h, being more evident in the last one. Therefore, these results demonstrate that R-Limonene caused pathological changes in the epithelium of the A. aegypti midgut at histophysiological and biochemical levels.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Leishmaniasis is a parasitosis with a wide incidence in developing countries. The drugs which are indicated for the treatment of this infection usually are able to promote high toxicity. PURPOSE: A combination of limonene and carvacrol, monoterpenes present in plants with antiparasitic activity may constitute an alternative for the treatment of these diseases. METHODS: In this study, the antileishmania activity against Leishmania major, cytotoxicity tests, assessment of synergism, parasite membrane damage tests as well as molecular docking and immunomodulatory activity of limonene-carvacrol (Lim-Car) combination were evaluated. RESULTS: The Lim-Car combination (5:0; 1:1; 1:4; 2:3; 3:2; 4:1 and 0:5) showed potential antileishmania activity, with mean inhibitory concentration (IC50) ranging from 5.8 to 19.0 μg.mL-1. They demonstrated mean cytotoxic concentration (CC50) ranging from 94.1 to 176.0 μg.mL-1, and did not show significant hemolytic effect. In the investigation of synergistic interaction, the 4:1 Lim-Car combination showed better fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index as well as better activity on amastigotes and IS. The samples caused considerable damage to the parasite membrane this monoterpene activity seems to be more related to Trypanothione Reductase (TryR) enzyme interaction, demonstrated in the molecular docking assay. In addition, the 4:1 Lim-Car combination stimulated macrophage activation, and showed at was the best association, with reduction of infection and infectivity of parasitized macrophages. CONCLUSION: The 4:1 Lim-Car combination appears to be a promising candidate as a monotherapeutic antileishmania agent.",

However, the mechanism of PF related to COVID (COVID-PF) is unknown. This study aimed to explore the key targets in the development of COVID-PF and the mechanism of d-limonene in the COVID-PF treatment. The differentially expressed genes of COVID-PF were downloaded from the GeneCards database, and their pathways were analyzed. d-Limonene was molecularly docked with related proteins to screen its pharmacological targets, and a rat lung fibrosis model was established to verify d-limonene's effect on COVID-PF-related targets. The results showed that the imbalance between collagen breakdown and metabolism, inflammatory response, and angiogenesis are the core processes of COVID-PF; and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways are the key targets of the treatment of COVID-PF. The ability of d-limonene to protect against PF induced by bleomycin in rats was reported. The mechanism is related to the binding of PI3K and NF-κB p65, and the inhibition of PI3K/Akt/IKK-α/NF-κB p65 signaling pathway expression and phosphorylation. These results confirmed the relationship between the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and COVID-PF, showing that d-limonene has a potential therapeutic value for COVID-PF."

Behavioral tests including the forced swimming test (FST), open field test (OFT), and splash test were performed. Finally, serum and hippocampal nitrite levels as well as the expression of inflammatory genes (IL-1β and TNF-α) in the hippocampus were measured. RESULTS: We showed that MS caused depressive-like behavior. Treatment of MS mice with limonene reduced the duration of immobility time in FST and increases the grooming activity time in the splash test. Limonene also reduces serum and brain nitrite levels and reduces the expression of IL-1β and TNF-α in the hippocampus. We found that L-NAME potentiated the effects of a subeffective dose of limonene. CONCLUSION: We concluded that the antidepressant-like effects of limonene are probably mediated through inhibition of neuroinflammation and attenuation of nitrite levels in the hippocampus.",

Dopamine and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) have been reported to play an important role in modulating anxiety in different parts of the brain. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: Herein, we report the anxiolytic activity of limonene. In addition, we identified a possible mechanism underlying the effect of limonene on DAergic and GABAergic neurotransmission. STUDY DESIGN: In this study, mice were injected with saline in the control group and limonene in the test group before behavioral analysis. We performed immunoblotting and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis after the behavioral study. RESULTS: The limonene treated group showed increased locomotor activity and open-arm preference in the elevated plus maze experiment. Limonene treatment increased the expression of both tyrosine hydroxylase and GAD-67 proteins and significantly upregulated dopamine levels in the striatum. Furthermore, tissue dopamine levels were increased in the striatum of mice following limonene treatment, and depolarization-induced GABA release was enhanced by limonene pre-treatment in PC-12 cells. Interestingly, limonene-induced anxiolytic activity and GABA release augmentation were blocked by an adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) antagonist. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that limonene inhibits anxiety-related behavior through A2A receptor-mediated regulation of DAergic and GABAergic neuronal activity.",

      "abstract": "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an ongoing pandemic and presents a public health emergency. It has affected millions of people and continues to affect more, despite the tremendous social preventive measures. The therapeutic strategy relies on suppressing infectivity and inflammation, along with immune modulation. The identification of candidate drugs effective for COVID-19 is crucial, thus many natural products including phytochemicals are also being proposed for repurposing and evaluated for their potential in COVID-19. Among numerous phytochemicals, limonene (LMN), a dietary terpene of natural origin has been recently showed to target viral proteins in the in-silico studies. LMN is one of the main compounds identified in many citrus plants, available and accessible in diets and well-studied for its therapeutic benefits. Due to dietary nature, relative safety and efficacy along with favorable physicochemical properties, LMN has been suggested to be a fascinating candidate for further investigation in COVID-19. LMN showed to modulate numerous signaling pathways and inhibits inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, prostanoids, and eicosanoids. We hypothesized that given the pathogenesis of COVID-19 involving infection, inflammation, and immunity, LMN may have potential to limit the severity and progression of the disease owing to its immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties. The present article discusses the possibilities of LMN in SARS-CoV-2 infections based on its immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties. Though, the suggestion on the possible use of LMN in COVID-19 remains inconclusive until the in-silico effects confirmed in the experimental studies and further proof of the concept studies. The candidature of LMN in COVID-19 treatment somewhat appear speculative but cannot be overlooked provided favorable physiochemical and druggable properties. The safety and efficacy of LMN are necessary to be established in preclinical and clinical studies before making suggestions for use in humans."

To uncover their toxic mechanism from programmed cell death (PCD), the photosynthetic pigments, chlorophyll fluorescence, caspase-like activities, cell size, nuclear variations and DNA ladders were investigated in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii treated with β-ionone (0.2 mM), limonene (0.2 mM) and longifolene (0.4 mM) at lethal concentration during 24 h. In the treatments with the 3 compounds, the photosynthetic pigments in C. reinhardtii cells gradually degraded, and Fv/Fm gradually decreased and disappeared at 24 h, suggesting that the cell death might be a PCD, due to the physiological activities gradually disappearing. During the cell death, the activities of caspase-9-like and caspase-3-like significantly increased, with the highest at 1 h. With prolonging the treatment time, C. reinhardtii cells gradually shrank, and the nuclei concentrated firstly following by a broken process, with moving to the cell edge. For DNA, obvious ladders were detected at 1 h, and then they gradually degraded to fragments of 100-250 bp at 24 h. These hallmarks suggested that β-ionone, limonene and longifolene may poison other algae by inducing PCD.",

PURPOSE: We aimed to examine whether D-limonene, a cyclic monoterpene, exhibited any antiseizure activity in the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced kindling mouse model and in vitro. METHODS: PTZ kindling mouse model was established by administering PTZ (30 mg/kg) intraperitoneally to mice once every 48 h. We performed immunoblot blots, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis after the behavioral study. RESULTS: An acute injection of PTZ (60 mg/kg) induced seizure in mice, while pretreatment with D-limonene inhibited PTZ-induced seizure. Repeated administration of PTZ (30 mg/kg) increased the seizure score gradually in mice, which was reduced in D-limonene (10 mg/kg)-pretreated group. In addition, D-limonene treatment increased glutamate decarboxylase-67 (GAD-67) expression in the hippocampus. Axonal sprouting of hippocampal neurons after kindling was inhibited by D-limonene pretreatment. Moreover, D-limonene reduced the expression levels of Neuronal PAS Domain Protein 4 (Npas4)-induced by PTZ. Furthermore, the adenosine A2A antagonist SCH58261 and ZM241385 inhibited anticonvulsant activity and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurotransmission-induced by D-limonene. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that D-limonene exhibits anticonvulsant activity through modulation of adenosine A2A receptors on GABAergic neuronal function.",

Although treatments have significantly improved, still more effective drugs are searched. One source for these drugs is natural products (NPs). One NP that has shown anticancer activity is Limonene. However, the mechanisms of limonene's antiproliferative, anticancer and antineoplastic activity are not fully understood. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature on this subject. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed using the Scopus, MEDLINE-PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct databases using the keywords: \"limonene\", \"cancer\", \"neoplasm\", and \"tumor\". The inclusion criteria were: in vivo and in vitro studies on the use of limonene in cancer published in English, Portuguese and Spanish until December 2019. Review articles, meta-analyses, abstracts, conference papers, editorials/ letters and case reports were excluded. RESULTS: The search identified 3568 articles, of which, 126 were selected for full reading, with 11 papers meeting the review criteria. Six more papers were added from the references of the initial 11 texts, giving a total of 17 papers. There was a high level of agreement in inclusion/exclusion (Kappa index > 80%). The risk of bias in the texts was shown to be high. CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis suggests that limonene acts mainly on tumor regression induced apoptosis and is a promising natural product for use in the treatment of several types of cancer.",

      "abstract": "Commensal yeast from the genus Candida is part of the healthy human microbiota. In some cases, Candida spp. dysbiosis can result in candidiasis, the symptoms of which may vary from mild localized rashes to severe disseminated infections. The most prevalent treatments against candidiasis involve fluconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, and caspofungin. Moreover, amphotericin B associated with prolonged azole administration is utilized to control severe cases. Currently, numerous guidelines recommend echinocandins to treat invasive candidiasis. However, resistance to these antifungal drugs has increased dramatically over recent years. Considering this situation, new therapeutic alternatives should be studied to control candidiasis, which has become a major medical concern. Limonene belongs to the group of terpene molecules, known for their pharmacological properties. In this study, we evaluated in vitro the limonene concentration capable of inhibiting the growth of yeast from the genus Candida susceptible or resistant to antifungal drugs and its capacity to induce fungal damage. In addition, intravaginal fungal infection assays using a murine model infected by Candida albicans were carried out and the fungal burden, histopathology, and scanning electron microscopy were evaluated. All of our results suggest that limonene may play a protective role against the infection process by yeast from the genus Candida."

      "abstract": "Animal models of asthma have shown that limonene, a naturally occurring terpene in citrus fruits, can reduce inflammation and airway reactivity. However, the mechanism of these effects is unknown. We first performed computational and molecular docking analyses that showed limonene could bind to both A2A and A2B receptors. The pharmacological studies were carried out with A2A adenosine receptor knock-out (A2AKO) and wild-type (WT) mice using ovalbumin (OVA) to generate the asthma phenotype. We investigated the effects of limonene on lung inflammation and airway responsiveness to methacholine (MCh) and NECA (nonselective adenosine analog) by administering limonene as an inhalation prior to OVA aerosol challenges in one group of allergic mice for both WT and KO. In whole-body plethysmography studies, we observed that airway responsiveness to MCh in WT SEN group was significantly lowered upon limonene treatment but no effect was observed in A2AKO. Limonene also attenuated NECA-induced airway responsiveness in WT allergic mice with no effect being observed in A2AKO groups. Differential BAL analysis showed that limonene reduced levels of eosinophils in allergic WT mice but not in A2AKO. However, limonene reduced neutrophils in sensitized A2AKO mice, suggesting that it may activate A2B receptors as well. These data indicate that limonene-induced reduction in airway inflammation and airway reactivity occurs mainly via activation of A2AAR but A2B receptors may also play a supporting role.",

      "abstract": "Astronauts are under high stress for a long time because of the microgravity condition, which leads to anxiety, affects their learning and memory abilities, and seriously impairs the health of astronauts. Aromatherapy can improve the physical and mental health of astronauts in a way that moisturizes them softly and silently. However, the strong volatility of fragrances and inconvenience of aroma treatment greatly limit their application in the field of spaceflight. In this study, reactive mesoporous silica nanoparticles were prepared to encapsulate and slowly release limonene. The limonene loaded nanoparticles were named limonene@mesoporous silica nanoparticles-cyanuric chloride (LE@MSNs-CYC). LE@MSNs-CYC were then applied to wallpaper to improve the convenience of aromatherapy. LE@MSNs-CYC could chemically react with the wallpaper, thus firmly adsorbed on the wallpaper. In the following, the mice were treated with hindlimb unloading (HU) to simulate a microgravity environment. The results showed that 28-day HU led to an increase in the level of anxiety and declines in learning, memory, and physical health in mice. LE@MSNs-CYC showed significant relief effects on anxiety, learning, memory, and physical health of HU treated mice. Subsequently, the molecular mechanisms were explored by hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis related hormones, immune-related cytokines, learning, and memory-related neurotransmitters and proteins."

Thirty male Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups: CTR-control, MI-muscle injury without treatment, TPU-therapeutic pulsed ultrasound alone, TPU + LIM-phonophoresis with 5% limonene, and LIM-5% limonene applied topically. Muscle injury was induced by a mechanical abrupt impact over gastrocnemius muscle. The animals were treated in the following intervals: 2, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after injury. Blood and gastrocnemius samples were collected 98 h after lesion for data analysis. Creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, lipid peroxidation (TBARS) levels, catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were assessed. CK (p = 0.01), SOD activity (p < 0.01), and TBARS levels (p < 0.01) were increased after injury. There was no effect on LDH levels in any group. Phonophoresis (TABRS p < 0.01; SOD p = 0.01), TPU alone (TBARS p < 0.01; SOD p = 0.01), and LIM alone (TBARS p < 0.01; SOD p < 0.01) reduced TBARS levels and SOD activity after muscle injury. There was no change for CAT activity after injury. Only phonophoresis reduced CK activity after injury (p < 0.01). There was no difference between phonophoresis, TPU alone and LIM alone groups for TBARS, SOD, CAT, and LDH. Limonene alone and TPU alone were effective in reducing oxidative stress parameters after skeletal muscle injury. Only phonophoresis decreased CK activity. Skeletal muscle injury increases reactive oxidative species (ROS) levels and muscle proteins activity as creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Five percent limonene, alone or associated with therapeutic pulsed ultrasound, exhibited reduction of CK, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity, and lipid peroxidation markers (TBARS).

Moreover, we also wanted to evaluate the antimicrobial efficiency and mechanism of β-lg-GA bilayer d-limonene emulsions. Physicochemically stable bilayer emulsions could be formed with an optimal concentration of GA (1.00 wt%), which showed a higher tolerance to both flocculation and coalescence, as well as better protective effects on d-limonene against UHT-treatment that up to 94.32% of d-limonene was retained in emulsions. Likewise, it is also noteworthy that no obvious difference in the minimal inhibitory concentration could be found between bilayer emulsions with or without UHT processing. Moreover, the antimicrobial effects of the bilayer emulsions with UHT treatment were shown to be dose-dependent, which was evidenced from the results of scanning electron microscopy and the determination of released cell constituents.

      "abstract": "α-Terpineol has been widely used in daily chemical, pharmaceutical, food, and flavor industries due to its pleasant odor with high economic value and pharmacological action. Our previous study showed that Penicillium digitatum DSM 62840 was an efficient biocatalyst for the transformation of limonene to α-terpineol. Thus, it was meaningful to explore the genome features and the gene expression differences of strain DSM 62840 during limonene biotransformation, and the detailed bioconversion pathways. In this study, the functional genes related to limonene bioconversion were investigated using genome and transcriptome sequences analysis. The results showed that the P. digitatum DSM 62840 genome was estimated to be 29.09 Mb and it encoded 9,086 protein-encoding genes. The most annotated genes were associated to some protein metabolism and energy metabolism functions. When the threshold for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was set at twofold ratio, a total of 4,128, and 4,148 DEGs were identified in P_L_12h (limonene-treated condition) compared with P_0h (blank) and P_12h (limonene-untreated blank), respectively. Among them, the expression levels of genes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, energy metabolism and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters were significantly altered during the biotransformation. And the reliability of these results was further confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Moreover, we found that the enzyme participated in limonene biotransformation was inducible. This enzyme was located in the microsome, and it was inhibited by cytochrome P450 inhibitors. This indicated that the cytochrome P450 may be responsible for the limonene bioconversion. Several differentially expressed cytochrome P450 genes were further identified, such as PDIDSM_85260 and PDIDSM_67430, which were significantly up-regulated with limonene treatment. These genes may be responsible for converting limonene to α-terpineol. Totally, the genomic and transcriptomic data could provide valuable information in the discovery of related-genes which was involved in limonene biotransformation, pathogenicity of fungi, and investigation of metabolites and biological pathways of strain DSM 62840."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The pulmonary inflammatory response results from exposure to injurious factors and is associated with oxidative stress, which intensifies the pathological reaction. In this context, limonene, a monoterpene found in citrus fruits, can be a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of this pathology, as it presents known anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the anti-inflammatory activity of limonene and its capacity to prevent and control respiratory system injuries. SEARCH STRATEGY: A comprehensive literature search of the Cochrane, Scopus, MEDLINE-PubMed, Web of Science, and Lilacs databases was performed using the keywords: \"limonene\", \"lung\", \"pulmonary\", \"airway\", \"trachea\", \"lung injury\", \"respiratory system\", \"respiratory tract diseases\". SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies on the use of limonene in disorders of the respiratory system, published until August 2019, were included. Those that did not use limonene alone or treated lesions in different systems other than the respiratory system, without targeting its anti-inflammatory action were excluded. In addition, review articles, meta-analyses, abstracts, conference papers, editorials/letters and case reports were also excluded. RESULTS: Of the 561 articles found, 64 were in the Cochrane database, 235 in Scopus, 99 in Web of science, 150 in PubMed and 13 in Lilacs. After completing the systematic steps, 25 articles were selected for full reading, after which 7 papers remained in the review. An article was added after a manual literature search, resulting in a total of 8 papers. There was a high level of agreement on inclusion/exclusion among the researchers who examined the papers (Kappa index > 88%). CONCLUSION: Limonene has effective anti-inflammatory activity in both preventing and controlling respiratory system injuries.",

This type of products have minimal processing conditions that can enable the survival and replication of pathogenic microorganisms. Among them, Listeria monocytogenes is of special concern, due to its relatively high mortality rate and its ability to replicate under refrigeration conditions. Previous research works have shown that nanoemulsified essential oils in combination with thermal treatments are effective for inactivating L. monocytogenes. However, previous research works were limited to isothermal conditions, whereas actual processing conditions in industry are dynamic. Under dynamic conditions, microorganism can respond unexpectedly to the thermal stress (e.g. adaptation, acclimation or increased sensitivity). In this work, we assess the combination of nanoemulsified D-limonene with thermal treatments under isothermal and dynamic conditions. The nanoemulsion was prepared following an innovative methodology using soya lecithin, a natural compound as well as the essential oil. Under isothermal heating conditions, the addition of the antimicrobial enables a reduction of the treatment time by a factor of 25. For time-varying treatments, dynamic effects were relevant. Treatments with a high heating rate (20 °C/min) are more effective than those with a slow heating rate (1 °C/min). This investigation demonstrates that the addition of nanoemulsified D-limonene can greatly reduce the intensity of the thermal treatments currently applied in the food industry. Hence, it can improve the product quality without impacting its safety.",

DESIGN: LEO and LIM were selected as experimental medicine, while sodium fluoride (NaF) and deionized water (DW) were positive and blank controls, respectively. Bovine incisors were used to establish enamel and dentin early caries models by demineralization method in vitro. Then specimens were subjected to pH cycling. Calcium and phosphate release of demineralizing solution were measured by an automatic biochemical analyzer; Surface microhardness tester and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer were used to detect the surface microhardness recovery and calcium- phosphate ratio on tooth surface; Degraded collagen matrix by collagenase was investigated by assaying hydroxyproline. RESULTS: Calcium release of dentin demineralizing solution of LEO group was lower than DW group's and higher than NaF group's. Both of LEO and LIM groups, the surface microhardness recovery were significantly lower than those of NaF group, which were similar to DW group. Dentin surface calcium- phosphate ratio of LEO and LIM groups were lower than those of NaF group and higher than those of DW group. Hydroxyproline concentration in the remineralizing solution of LEO and LIM groups were lower than DW groups' and higher than NaF groups'. CONCLUSIONS: LEO and LIM have influence on the progress of dentin early caries, which can stabilize its structure by inhibiting collagen degradation. Meanwhile, these medicines may provide a new drug choice for the prevention and treatment of early root caries.",

Terpenes, isoprene based-phytochemicals emitted from trees, are largely responsible for these beneficial effects of forest bathing. Although the therapeutic effects of terpenes on various diseases have been revealed, their effects on neuronal health have not yet been studied in detail. Here, we screened 16 terpenes that are the main components of Korean forests using Drosophila Alzheimer's disease (AD) models to identify which terpenes have neuroprotective effects. Six out of the 16 terpenes, ρ-cymene, limonene (+), limonene (-), linalool, α-pinene (+), and β-pinene (-), partially suppressed the beta amyloid 42 (Aβ42)-induced rough eye phenotype when fed to Aβ42-expressing flies. Among them, limonene (+) restored the decreased survival of flies expressing Aβ42 in neurons during development. Limonene (+) treatment did not affect Aβ42 accumulation and aggregation, but did cause to decrease cell death, reactive oxygen species levels, extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation, and inflammation in the brains or the eye imaginal discs of Aβ42-expressing flies. This neuroprotective effect of limonene (+) was not associated with autophagic activity. Our results suggest that limonene (+) has a neuroprotective function against the neurotoxicity of Aβ42 and, thus, is a possible therapeutic reagent for AD.",

      "abstract": "Limonene is a monoterpenoid compound, which is founded in a lot of plants' essential oils with good antibacterial activity against food-borne pathogens, but it has an ambiguous antimicrobial susceptibility and mechanism against Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes). In this study, the antimicrobial susceptibility of Limonene to L. monocytogenes was studied, and some new sights regarding its antibacterial mechanism were further explored. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) verified that limonene caused the destruction of the cell integrity and wall structure of L. monocytogenes. The increase in conductivity and the leakage of intracellular biomacromolecules (nucleic acids and proteins) confirmed that limonene had an obvious effect on cell membrane permeability. The results of Propidium Iodide (PI) fluorescence staining were consistent with the results of the conductivity measurements. This indicated that limonene treatment caused damage to the L. monocytogenes cell membrane. Furthermore, the decrease in ATP content, ATPase (Na+K+-ATPase, Ca2+-ATPase) activity and respiratory chain complex activity indicated that limonene could hinder ATP synthesis by inhibiting the activity of the respiratory complex and ATPase. Finally, differential expression of proteins in the respiratory chain confirmed that limonene affected respiration and energy metabolism by inhibiting the function of the respiratory chain complex.",

In this study, we prepared D-limonene-loaded niosomes (D-limonene/Nio) for cancer therapy through in vitro cytotoxicity assay of HepG2, MCF-7, and A549 cell lines. The niosomal formulation was prepared by film hydration technique with Span® 40: Tween® 40: cholesterol (35:35:30 molar ratio) and characterized for vesicle distribution size, morphology, entrapment efficiency (EE%), and in vitro release behaviour. The obtained niosomes showed a nanometric size and spherical morphology with EE% about 87 ± 1.8%. Remarkably prolonged release of D-limonene from niosomes compared to free D-limonene observed. The loaded formulation showed significantly enhanced cytotoxic activity with all three cancer cell lines (HepG2, Macf-7 and A549) at the concentration of 20 μM. These results indicated that niosome loaded with phytochemicals can be a promising nano-carrier for cancer therapy applications."

      "abstract": "The stress-induced hormone corticosterone initiates oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, culminating in cell apoptosis and neurological changes. We assessed the effects of d-Limonene on a PC12 cellular model of corticosterone-induced neurotoxicity, and whether these effects involved the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPKα) pathway. PC12 cells were treated with corticosterone with or without d-limonene for 24 h. Western blots were performed to measure activation of AMPK pathway members [Silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog-1 (SIRT1), AMPKα, and nuclear factor (NFκB)], reactive oxygen species, inflammatory cytokines, and markers of apoptosis. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) was used to measure cell death after treatment. d-Limonene reversed the effects of corticosterone on PC12 cells: it decreased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO), activities of NADPH oxidase (p67-phox and p47-phox), expression of pro-inflammatory markers [inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)], and expression of pro-apoptotic proteins [Bcl2 associated with X protein (Bax) and cleaved caspase-3)]. d-Limonene also increased levels of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 while decreasing the number of TUNEL-positive cells. d-limonene significantly activated AMPKα and suppressed NF-κB nuclear translocation through up-regulation of SIRT1. Addition of compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, severely weakened these neuroprotective effects of d-limonene. d-Limonene has a neuroprotective effect on corticosterone-induced PC12 cell injury induced by activating the AMPKα signaling pathway, and thereby inhibiting reactive oxygen species and inflammatory factors. These data suggest that d-limonene might protect against neuronal death to improve depressive symptoms.",

METHOD: The tail vein injection model of K562 cells in immunocompromised C57BL/6 mice was developed and evaluated for characteristics of the disease. The mice were treated with d-Limonene and evaluated for haematological parameters. We also evaluated the effect of d-Limonene on angiogenesis using the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. RESULTS: In a complete blood count, a significant dose-dependent reduction in white blood cell, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, but an elevation in red blood cell count and haemoglobin content was observed with d-Limonene treatment compared to the disease control or untreated group. In the CAM assay, d-Limonene produced a significant dose-dependent reduction in number of blood vessels in treatment groups compared to the vehicle-treated group. CONCLUSION: These studies suggest promising anti-leukemic and anti-angiogenic effects of d-Limonene in the treatment of CML."

      "abstract": "Horticulturalists and gardeners in temperate regions often claim that planting marigolds next to tomato plants protects the tomatoes from the glasshouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum Westwood). If shown to hold true, this technique could be used in larger-scale tomato production, protecting the crop and helping to introduce greater plant diversity into these agro-ecosystems. Here we present two large-scale glasshouse trials corresponding to the two main ways growers are likely to use marigolds to control whiteflies. In the first, marigolds are grown next to tomato throughout the growing period and we quantify whitefly population growth from the seedling stage over a 48 day infestation period. Here we show that association with marigolds significantly slows whitefly population development. Introducing additional whitefly-attractive 'pull' plants around the perimeter of plots has little effect, but reducing the proportion of marigolds and introducing other non-hosts of whiteflies (basil, nasturtium and Chinese cabbage) also reduces whitefly populations on tomato. The second experiment assesses the efficacy of marigolds when used as an 'emergency' measure. Here we allow whitefly populations to build to a high density on unprotected tomatoes then introduce marigolds and assess whitefly population over a further period. Following laboratory work showing limonene to be a major chemical component of French marigolds and a negative behaviour response of whiteflies to this compound, limonene dispensers are added as an additional treatment to this experiment. \"Emergency\" marigold companion planting yielded minimal reductions in whitefly performance, but the use of limonene dispensers was more effective. Our work indicates that companion planting short vine tomatoes with French marigolds throughout the growing season will slow development of whitefly populations. Introducing marigolds to unprotected tomatoes after significant whitefly build-up will be less effective. The use of limonene dispensers placed near to tomato plants also shows promise. It is argued that this work supports the possibility of the development of a mixture of tomato companion plants that infer 'associational resistance' against many major invertebrate pests of tomato. Such a mixture, if comprising edible or ornamental plants, would be economically viable, would reduce the need for additional chemical and biological control, and, if used outdoors, would generate plant-diverse agro-ecosystems that are better able to harbour invertebrate wildlife.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In an increasing search for natural products that may heal the ulcers and avoid its recurrence, limonene appears as a promising candidate. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: The present study aimed to investigate the protective effect of limonene in ethanol-induced gastric ulcers, in addition, to investigate the involvement of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, besides the modulation of gene expression. STUDY DESIGN: Male Wistar rats were orally treated with vehicle (8% tween 80), carbenoxolone (100 mg/kg) or limonene (25, 50 or 100 mg/kg) and then orally received ethanol to induce gastric ulcers formation. METHODS: The activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) was measured. Levels of glutathione (GSH) and activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured. We investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of limonene measuring the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) by ELISA. Additionally, we investigate through real-time PCR (qPCR) the gene expression of nuclear factor-kappa B (Nf-κb), Gpx, Il-1β, Mpo, and Il-10. RESULTS: Our results showed that limonene 50 mg/kg was the lowest effective dose, offering 93% of reduction in gastric ulcer area compared with the vehicle. There was an increase in mucus production and higher preservation of gastric mucosa integrity after treatment with limonene.There was a reduction in the MPO activity, a biomarker of neutrophils infiltration, and an increase in GPx activity, suggesting an antioxidant effect. Limonene displayed anti-inflammatory activity through decreasing the levels of TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-1β and increasing the level of IL-10. Limonene could down-regulate the expression of Nf-κb, Il-1β, and Mpo and up-regulate the expression of Gpx. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that oral treatment with limonene exerts gastroprotection through local mucosal defense mechanisms, such as increasing the mucus production, modulation of the oxidative stress and inflammatory response and inhibition of Nf-κb expression.",

It is the condition of mixed dyslipidemia which may favor the development of insulin resistance via lipotoxic mechanisms. Our objective of the study was to investigate the potential role of R-limonene (LM) on differentiation, lipid storage, and 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) uptake in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Genes and proteins associated with differentiation, lipid accumulation, 2DG uptake and its signaling pathways in the adipocytes were analyzed using qPCR and western blot methods. LM treatment increased differentiation, lipid accumulation, and the expression of adipogenic and lipogenic markers such as C/EBP-α, C/EBP-β, PPARγ, SREBP-1, RXR, FAS, and adiponectin. However, the LM concentration at 10μM decreased (p < 0.05) adipogenesis and lipogenesis via regulating key transcriptional factors. LM treatment increased activation of Akt by increasing its phosphorylation, but p44/42 activation was not altered. MK-2206, an Akt specific inhibitor, reduced the activation of Akt phosphorylation whereas LM treatment aborted the MK-2206 mediated inhibition of Akt activation. LM enhanced glucose uptake in differentiated adipocytes. Overall data suggested that LM treatment favored lipid storage and glucose uptake in adipocytes via activation of key transcriptional factors through activation of Akt phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes."

It is well-known for the generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydroxyl radicals, superoxide anions, nitric oxide, and hydrogen peroxide.

In our study, we have investigated the ameliorative effect of limonene against Cd-induced genotoxicity using various biomarkers such as sister chromatid exchange (SCE), comet, and lipid peroxidation (LPA) assays in cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from healthy individuals. It is a naturally occurring flavonoid, found in essential oil of citrus fruits. Limonene at 20-μM and 100-μM concentrations had significantly (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01) reduced the SCE frequency, tail moment, and peroxidation of lipids. Ameliorative effect of limonene was also determined by measuring the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). We found a significant increase (P < 0.05) in the enzyme activity after limonene treatment. We also studied the effect of GSTP1 gene polymorphism on Cd-induced genotoxicity and antigenotoxic potential of limonene. We found a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in SCE frequency, tail moment, and lipid peroxidation after limonene treatment compared to Cd. However, we did not observe any significant relationship (P > 0.05) between GSTP1 polymorphism and Cd, limonene genotoxicity and antigenotoxicity, respectively.",

Considering its increasing applications, it's necessary to understand toxicological effects and risk associated with its use. R-(+)-limonene is rapidly absorbed in experimental animals and human beings following oral administration. In humans, it gets distributed to liver, kidney, and blood resulting in the formation of metabolites like perillic acid, dihydroperillic acid, limonene-1,8-diol and limonene-1,2 diol. Important toxic effects primarily reported in rodents are severe hyaline droplet nephrotoxicity (only in male rats due to specific protein α2u-globulin; however, this effect isn't valid for humans), hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity. R-(+)-limonene does not show genotoxic, immunotoxic and carcinogenic effects. Substantial data is available about limonene's stability after treatment with thermal and non-thermal food processing techniques; however, information about toxicity of metabolites formed and their safe scientific limits is not available. In addition, toxicity of limonene degradation products formed during storage of citrus juices isn't known. Based on all available toxicological considerations, R-(+)-limonene can be categorized as low toxic additive. More detailed studies are required to better understand interaction of limonene with modern food processing techniques as well as degradation products generated and toxicity arising from such products.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chagas Disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi infection, is one of the most important neglected tropical diseases (NTD), without an effective therapy for the successful parasite eradication or for the blocking of the disease's progression, in its advanced stages. Due to their low toxicity, wide pharmacologic spectrum, and potential synergies, medicinal plants as Lippia alba, offer a promising reserve of bioactive molecules. The principal goal of this work is to characterize the inhibitory properties and cellular effects of the Citral and Carvone L. alba chemotype essential oils (EOs) and their main bioactive terpenes (and the synergies among them) on T. cruzi forms. METHODS: Twelve L. alba EOs, produced under diverse environmental conditions, were extracted by microwave assisted hydrodistillation, and chemically characterized using gas chromatography coupled mass spectrometry. Trypanocidal activity and cytotoxicity were determined for each oil, and their major compounds, on epimastigotes (Epi), trypomastigotes (Tryp), amastigotes (Amas), and Vero cells. Pharmacologic interactions were defined by a matrix of combinations among the most trypanocidal terpenes (limonene, carvone; citral and caryophyllene oxide). The treated cell phenotype was assessed by fluorescent and optic microscopy, flow cytometry, and DNA electrophoresis assays. RESULTS: The L. alba EOs displayed significant differences in their chemical composition and trypanocidal performance (p = 0.0001). Citral chemotype oils were more trypanocidal than Carvone EOs, with Inhibitory Concentration 50 (IC50) of 14 ± 1.5 μg/mL, 22 ± 1.4 μg/mL and 74 ± 4.4 μg/mL, on Epi, Tryp and Amas, respectively. Limonene exhibited synergistic interaction with citral, caryophyllene oxide and Benznidazole (decreasing by 17 times its IC50) and was the most effective and selective treatment. The cellular analysis suggested that these oils or their bioactive terpenes (citral, caryophyllene oxide and limonene) could be inducing T. cruzi cell death by an apoptotic-like mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: EOs extracted from L. alba Citral chemotype demonstrated significant trypanocidal activity on the three forms of T. cruzi studied, and their composition and trypanocidal performance were influenced by production parameters. Citral, caryophyllene oxide, and limonene showed a possible induction of an apoptotic-like phenotype. The best selective anti-T. cruzi activity was achieved by limonene, the effects of which were also synergic with citral, caryophyllene oxide and benznidazole.",

      "abstract": "Bovine mastitis causes large annual economic losses around the world. Different microorganisms are associated with the disease. The capacity of pathogens to adhere to bovine mammary epithelial cells is associated with biofilm production which leads to antibiotic resistance. Research is now leading to search alternative control methods and medicinal plants constitute a natural, safe, effective and inexpensive option. Minthostachys verticillata is an autochthonous medicinal plant of Argentina with multiple ethnobotanical properties. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the essential oil (EO) of this species and limonene, one of its compounds, inhibited the growth of mastitis pathogens. The objective of the present work was to determine the inhibitory effect of the essential oil of M. verticillata and limonene, on biofilm formation and on mature biofilm produced by pathogens isolated from bovine mastitis. Time kill assay and bacterial lysis were also determined. Furthermore, RAPD-PCR assays were performed to determine changes in bacterial DNA after EO and limonene exposition. Bacterial isolates were identified as Escherichia coli (EC3 and EC9), Bacillus pumilus (BP5, BP6, and BP7) and Enterococcus faecium (EF1) by rRNA 16S sequencing and MALDI-TOF MS. All the strains were able to form biofilm. Addition of both lactose and sucrose did not affect biofilm production. MIC values for EO were 3.6 mg/ml for E. faecium; 0.9 mg/ml for E. coli (EC3), 14.5 mg/ml for E. coli (EC9), 1.8 mg/ml for B. pumilus (BP7), 3.63 mg/ml for B. pumilus (BP6) and 29.0 mg/ml for B. pumilus (BP7). MIC values for limonene were 6.6 mg/ml for B. pumilus (BP6) and 105 mg/ml for B. pumilus (BP5). These results demonstrated that EO was more effective than limonene, showing also bactericidal action against E. faecium (minimal inhibitory concentration (MBC) = 29.0 mg/ml). This result was corroborated by time of death assay, observing a cell decrease after at 6 h, and then by bacterial lysis assay. Both EO and limonene affected mature biofilm of isolated strains. The results contribute to the study of EO and limonene which may serve as a therapy against bovine mastitis pathogens inhibiting the development of pathogenic bacteria."

MAIN METHODS: Cytotoxicity of 4-FTSC in PC-3 cells was evaluated using MTT assay. Morphology examination of PC-3 cells treated with 4-FTSC was also performed as well as the cell death mechanisms induced were investigated using flow cytometry. Parameters of toxicity of 4-FTSC was conducted by the investigation of its potential myelotoxicity and lymphotoxicity, hemolytic activity and acute oral toxicity profile. KEY FINDINGS: 4-FTSC showed promising cytotoxic effects against PC-3 cells (IC50 = 18.46 μM). It also triggered apoptotic morphological changes, phosphatidylserine externalization and a significant increase of DNA fragmentation in PC-3 cells. Moreover, 4-FTSC did not show changes in the PC-3 cell cycle with levels of p21, p27, NFĸB and cyclin D1 similar to those found in both control and treated cells. 4-FTSC also promoted an increase of p53 levels associated with mitochondrial impairment through loss of ∆Ψm and ROS overproduction. 4-FTSC-induced cell death mechanism in PC-3 cells involved activation of caspase-3/-7 through apoptosis intrinsic pathway via caspase-9. Regarding toxicological profile, 4-FTSC showed in vitro lymphotoxicity, although with low cytotoxicity for bone marrow progenitors and no hemolytic potential. Moreover, it was classified as GHS category 5 (LD50 > 2000-5000 mg/Kg), suggesting it has low acute oral systemic toxicity. SIGNIFICANCE: 4-FTSC seems to be a promising candidate to be used as a clinical tool in prostate cancer treatment. Further studies are required to better clarify its toxicopharmacological effects found in this compound.",

However, the mechanisms by which d-limonene achieves these effects, especially in lung cancer, are not entirely clear. Therefore, the goal of this study was to examine the effects of d-limonene on lung cancer and explore its mechanisms of action. METHODS: We examined the therapeutic effects of d-limonene on lung cancer cells and in a xenograft animal model by characterizing its effects on the pathways of apoptosis and autophagy. Cell proliferation was measured using the Cell Counting Kit-8, and apoptosis was determined by flow cytometric analysis. Levels of LC3 puncta, an autophagy marker, were analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscopy. Autophagy and apoptosis-related gene expression were assessed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. RESULTS: d-limonene inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells and suppressed the growth of transplanted tumors in nude mice. Expression of apoptosis and autophagy-related genes were increased in tumors after treatment with d-limonene. Furthermore, the use of chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, and knockdown of the atg5 gene, suppressed the apoptosis induced by d-limonene. CONCLUSION: d-limonene may have a therapeutic effect on lung cancer as it can induce apoptosis of lung cancer cells by promoting autophagy."

      "abstract": "This study proposes the evaluation of the suitability of mesophilic anaerobic digestion as a simple technology for the treatment of the citrus waste produced by small-medium agro-industrial enterprises involved in the transformation of Citrus fruits. Two different stocks of citrus peel waste were used (i.e., fresh and stored citrus peel waste), to evaluate the influence of waste composition (variability in the type of processed Citrus fruits) and of storage (potentially necessary to operate the anaerobic digester continuously over the whole year due to the seasonality of the production) on anaerobic degradation treatability. A thorough characterization of the two waste types has been performed, showing that the fresh one has a higher solid and organic content, and that, in spite of the similar values of oil fraction amounts, the two stocks are significantly different in the composition of essential oils (43% of limonene and 34% of linalyl acetate in the fresh citrus waste and 20% of limonene and 74% of linalyl acetate in the stored citrus waste). Contrarily to what observed in previous studies, anaerobic digestion was successful and no reactor acidification occurred. No inhibition by limonene and linalyl acetate even at the maximum applied organic load value (i.e., 2.72 gCODwaste/gVSinoculum) was observed in the treatment of the stored waste, with limonene and linalyl acetate concentrations of 104 mg/l and 385 mg/l, respectively. On the contrary, some inhibition was detected with fresh citrus peel waste when the organic load increased from 2.21 to 2.88 gCODwaste/gVSinoculum, ascribable to limonene at initial concentration higher than 150 mg/l. A good conversion into methane was observed with fresh peel waste, up to 0.33  [Formula: see text] at the highest organic load, very close to the maximum theoretical value of 0.35 [Formula: see text] , while a lower efficiency was achieved with stored peel waste, with a reduction down to 0.24  [Formula: see text] at the highest organic load.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene (CTL) found in citrus fruits and many plant kingdoms. It has attracted attention as potential molecule due to its diverse biological activities. However, molecular mechanism involved in the osteogenic induction of CTL in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells remain unclear. PURPOSE: Skeletal development maintains the bone homeostasis through bone remodeling process. It coordinated between the osteoblast and osteoblast process. Osteoporosis is one of the most common bone diseases caused by a systemic reduction in bone mass. Recent osteoporosis treatment is based on the use of anti-resorptive and bone forming drugs. However, long term use of these drugs is associated with serious side effects and strategies on the discovery of lead compounds from natural products for osteoblast differentiation are urgently needed. Therefore, we planned to find out the role of CTL on osteoblast differentiation and glucose uptake in C2C12 cells and its effect on signaling pathways. METHODS: Cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, calcium deposition, genes, and proteins associated with osteoblast activation and glucose utilization were analysed. RESULTS: CTL did not affect the cell viability. CTL significantly increased ALP activity, calcium depositions and the expression of osteogenic specific genes such as Myogenin, Myogenic differentiation 1 (MyoD), ALP, Run-related transcription factor 2(RUNX2), osteocalcin (OCN). In addition, CTL induced the mRNA expression of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP-2 BMP-4 BMP-6 BMP-7 BMP-9). CTL treatment enhanced 2-Deoxy-d-glucose (2DG) uptake. Moreover, CTL stimulated the activation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38MAPK), Protein kinase B (Akt), Extracellular signal related kinase (ERKs) by increasing phosphorylation. CTL treatment abolished p38 inhibitor (SB203580) mediated inhibition of osteoblast differentiation, but no effect was noted by ERKs specific inhibitor (PD98059). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that limonene induces osteoblast differentiation and glucose uptake through activating p38MAPK and Akt signaling pathways, confirming the molecular basis of the osteoblast differentiation by limonene in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells.",

Reports in the scientific literature have demonstrated that the consumption of terpenes is a successful alternative in the treatment of several diseases, triggering beneficial biological effects in clinical and preclinical studies. The monoterpene limonene is largely used in alimentary items, cleaning products, and it is one of the most frequent fragrances used in cosmetics formulation. The therapeutic effects of limonene have been extensively studied, proving anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antinociceptive, anticancer, antidiabetic, antihyperalgesic, antiviral, and gastroprotective effects, among other beneficial effects in health. In this review, we collected, presented, and analyzed evidence from the scientific literature regarding the usage of limonene and its activities and underlying mechanisms involved in combating diseases. The highlighting of limonene applications could develop a useful targeting of innovative research in this field as well as the development of a limonene-based phytomedicine which could be used in a variety of conditions of health and disease.",

      "abstract": "Anti-Candida potential of limonene was evaluated against planktonic growth, biofilm (adhesion, development and maturation) and morphogenesis of Candida albicans in this study. Limonene is a major constituent of citrus oil and most frequently used terpene in food and beverage industry due to its pleasant fragrance, nontoxic, and is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) flavoring agent as well as treatment option in many gastrointestinal diseases.Limonene exhibited excellent anti-Candida activity and was equally effective against planktonic growth of C. albicans isolates differentially susceptible to FLC (N = 35). Limonene inhibited morphogenesis significantly at low concentration. However, it showed stage dependent activity against biofilm formation, that is, it was more effective against adhesion followed by development and maturation. Limonene also exhibited excellent synergy with FLC against planktonic and biofilm growth. SWATH-MS analysis led to identification of limonene responsive proteins that provided molecular insight of its anti-Candida activity. Proteomic analysis revealed upregulation of proteins involved in cell wall glucan synthesis (Kre6); oxidative stress (Rhr2, Adh7 and Ebp1); DNA damage stress (Mbf1 and Npl3); nucleolar stress (Rpl11, Rpl7, Rpl29, Rpl15) and down regulation of cytoskeleton organization (Crn1, Pin3, Cct8, Rbl2), and so forth, in response to limonene. Limonene mediated down regulation of Tps3 indicates activation of caspase (CaMca1) and induction of apoptosis in C. albicans. These results suggest that limonene inhibits C. albicans growth by cell wall/membrane damage induced oxidative stress that leads to DNA damage resulting into modulation of cell cycle and induction of apoptosis through nucleolar stress and metacaspase dependent pathway.",

D-Limonene is a common natural monocyclic monoterpene possessing various activities. The present study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of D-limonene against ischemia-associated cerebral injury in hypertensive SHRsp rats. Although systolic blood pressure was not altered by ischemia, D-Limonene decreased the systolic blood pressure of SHRsp rats following stroke. Induction of stroke resulted in increased escape latency time, decreased time spent in the target quadrant in the probe trial, decreased capacity to distinguish between familiar objects and novel objects, and increased sensory neglect in the SHRsp rat, however these symptoms were significantly inhibited by D-limonene. D-limonene also decreased the cerebral infarct size in the SHRsp rats following stroke. D-Limonene markedly decreased the mRNA expression of interleukin-1β, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 in SHRsp rats following stroke. The mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in the brain of SHRsp rats following stroke was significantly increased by D-Limonene. D-Limonene increased the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase, decreased the malondialdehyde level, increased glutathione content and reduced the DHE-staining in SHRsp rats following stroke. Overall, inhibition of cerebral inflammation, vascular remodeling and antioxidant activities of D-Limonene may be involved in the protective effects against ischemia-induced damage in SHRsp rats. The present study identified D-Limonene as a potential therapeutic candidate for treatment of stroke-associated cerebral and vascular damage under conditions of hypertension."

      "abstract": "Limonene (C₁₀H₁₆) and bisabolene (C₁₅H₂₄) are both naturally occurring terpenes in plants. Depending on the number of C₅ units, limonene and bisabolene are recognized as representative monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, respectively. Limonene and bisabolene are important pharmaceutical and nutraceutical products used in the prevention and treatment of cancer and many other diseases. In addition, they can be used as starting materials to produce a range of commercially valuable products, such as pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, cosmetics, and biofuels. The low abundance or yield of limonene and bisabolene in plants renders their isolation from plant sources non-economically viable. Isolation of limonene and bisabolene from plants also suffers from low efficiency and often requires harsh reaction conditions, prolonged reaction times, and expensive equipment cost. Recently, the rapid developments in metabolic engineering of microbes provide a promising alternative route for producing these plant natural products. Therefore, producing limonene and bisabolene by engineering microbial cells into microbial factories is becoming an attractive alternative approach that can overcome the bottlenecks, making it more sustainable, environmentally friendly and economically competitive. Here, we reviewed the status of metabolic engineering of microbes that produce limonene and bisabolene including microbial hosts, key enzymes, metabolic pathways and engineering of limonene/bisabolene biosynthesis. Furthermore, key challenges and future perspectives were discussed.",
