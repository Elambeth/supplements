      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hymenolepis nana is a worldwide intestinal tapeworm parasite that mainly infects children due to a lack of awareness and hygiene. Recently, Praziquantel (PZQ), the drug of choice for treating hymenolepiasis, has shown serious side effects. This study aimed to evaluate histological changes in the ileum of the small intestine caused by hymenolepiasis in an experimental animal model and to assess the efficacy of pumpkin seeds extract (PSE) in eliminating the parasite at different periods compared to medicinal treatment with PZQ drug. In addition, we investigated the morphological alterations in adult dwarf tapeworms after treatment with pumpkin seed extract. METHODS: The histological examination of the small intestine was conducted among four experimental mice groups: normal non-infected control group, infected untreated group, infected and PZQ treated group, and the fourth group was infected and treated with PSE.The morphological investigations were performed on mice from the infected untreated group and those from the infected and treated with pumpkin seed extract group. RESULTS: Treatment with PSE showed a noticeable preservation of the normal structure of villi and crypts with a normal thickness of the muscle layer. In addition, there was a marked decrease in the number of mononuclear leukocytes and goblet cells. This effect was observed to be duration dependent. The size of the mature segment in the untreated control group ranged from 342.85 to 415.38 μm, and 14.28-26.92 μm in length and width, respectively. The gravid segments revealed a uterus with eggs subjugating the entire area in the segment, with size ranges from 373.33 to 576.92 μm in length and 46.66-76.92 μm in width. The treated group with PSE showed mature segments with size ranged from 261.53 to 346.42 μm in length and 7.69-21.42 μm in width, while the gravid segments ranged from 30.76 to 50 μm and 414.28-492.30 μm, in width and length, respectively. The treatment with pumpkin seed extract tenanted the worm growth through an apparent reduction in the sizes of proglottids, deformity of the lateral margins and gonads, loss of internal structure, and reduction of egg production. CONCLUSION: The results of this study clearly reveal the efficacy of pumpkin seeds on H. nana infection, a promising, safe, inexpensive natural alternative anthelmintic therapy, with more superior and significant results in improving and protecting mucosal integrity in comparison to PZQ.",

      "abstract": "Amburana cearensis is a plant native to Brazil used in folk medicine for the treatment of several pathological conditions including stroke. Previous research indicates that a dichloromethane extract of A. cearensis seeds (EDAC), rich in coumarins, protects neural cells against oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and glutamate-induced stress. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the role of coumarin, in the protective effect of EDAC. Glutamatergic excitotoxicity is an important cause of neuronal loss involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and ischemic stroke. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the protective effects of coumarin isolated from EDAC against glutamate excitotoxicity in regulating MAPK pathway proteins and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production on PC12 cells. Furthermore, we aimed to investigate the protective effects of coumarin against cell death induced by OGD. We characterized the isolated compound from EDAC as coumarin by 1H and 13C-NMR. Thus, PC12 cells were exposed to OGD or glutamate (20 mM) and/or treated with EDAC or coumarin (500 μg/mL) for 24 h. Subsequently, cell viability was assessed by propidium iodide staining or by MTT test. Furthermore, the expression of MAPK pathway proteins was investigated by Western blot analysis and the expression of cleaved caspase-3 by immunofluorescence. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was assessed by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate and CellROX. We observed that EDAC and coumarin were able to protect PC12 cells against OGD conditions. Moreover, EDAC totally inhibited the glutamate toxicity in PC12 cells. Meanwhile, coumarin mitigated the glutamate toxicity. Both were able to downregulate the expression of ERK1/2 and phosphorylated ERK and inhibit caspase-3 activation. EDAC and coumarin also prevented the increase of ROS induced by treatment with H2O2 or glutamate. Our results evidenced that coumarin from A. cearensis is antioxidative and is an important cytoprotective compound in EDAC against glutamate excitotoxicity or OGD injury."

      "abstract": "To investigate the impact of pre-sowing magnetic treatment on soybean plants under natural conditions, a study was carried out focusing on the photosynthetic machinery. Soybean seeds were subjected to magneto-priming through exposure to pulsed magnetic field (PMF, 200 mT for 1 h) and static magnetic field (SMF, 200 mT for 1 h). The dual pulse-amplitude modulator (PAM) technique was employed to assess the simultaneous performance of photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI) in magneto-primed soybean seeds. It was observed that after magnetic treatment (MT), the effective quantum yield of photosystem II [Y(II)] exhibited an increase, accompanied by a reduction in non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). Furthermore, the quantum yield of photosystem I [Y(I)] showed enhancement, reaching its maximum in the 200 mT PMF treatment. Non-photochemical quenching was lower in MT-treated seed plants as compared to control, indicating a reduction in energy dissipation and an enhancement in energy transfer from PSII to PSI. The magneto-primed seeds demonstrated an increased electron transport mechanism as evidenced by enhanced ETR(I) and ETR(II). Additionally, lower values of Y(NA) and Y(ND) suggested improved activity of both PSI and PSII in regulating energy transport in cyclic electron flow (CEF) and linear electron flow (LEF). The results suggest that PMF treatment is more beneficial than SMF for enhancing photosynthetic efficiency via regulation of PS II and PSI quantum yield."

      "abstract": "Wound healing is a complicated physiological process that involves several stages including hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation and repair to rebuild the integrity of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Millions of people around the world are affected by poor wound healing, causing increased mortality rates and related costs. Immedicable wounds are a health problem because they directly affect the person's standard of living and produce an ultimatum to the health of people and the international economy because of the expensive medical treatment. Other schemes/approaches must be designed to achieve productive and therapeutic results. In this context, the emergence of Nano biotechnology may provide another manifesto to produce latest drugs for long-term treatment processes. This article shows that the implementation of metal nanoparticles (Au and Ag) has unbolted a brand-new gateway in the discipline of eco-friendly medicine due to their unique properties such as medicine transportation, antimicrobial activity and quick recovery. Moreover, metal nanoparticles (NPs) manufactured by green synthesis not only add the effects of nanoparticles and plant extracts but also reduce toxicity to tissues and make their use safer. In the present work, Ag and Au nanoparticles were synthesized using an aqueous seed extract of Cichorium intybus and their wound healing ability was assessed by performing in-vivo wound healing activity on albino mice. Till now there is no study available on the in-vivo wound healing potential of Ag and Au nanoparticles using Cichorium intybus. This is the first study ever to assess the ability of Cichorium intybus seed extract and its metal nanoparticles (AgNPs & AuNPs) to promote wound healing in animals which shows its uniqueness and novelty. The results displayed augmented and quicker wound closure with Ag as compared to the Au nanoparticles, polyfax and simple plant extract in a 21-day research work. These results illustrated that eco-friendly prepared nanoparticles provide a prominent approach to fight with the bacteria resistant against combination therapy without any lethal affair. Environment-friendly NPs declared to be the low-cost best treatment for the faster recovery of wounds. The main goal of this research is to provide aid in the creation of plant-based, durable and affordable Nano medicine for wound care, lowering dependency on synthetic techniques and encouraging environmental friendly biomedical applications.",

A randomized block design was used, assessing germination, vigor, electrical conductivity, seedling length, and dry mass. Treatments T7 (co-inoculation R. tropici + A. brasilense at R5) showed the highest germination rates, indicating enhanced seed viability. The accelerated aging test revealed that T7 exhibited greater resistance to stress, presenting greater seedling vigor, whereas T10 and T11 were more susceptible. The electrical conductivity results remained stable across treatments, suggesting that cell membrane integrity was not significantly compromised. Seedling length and dry mass did not present significant variations, reinforcing the idea that early germination and vigor are primary indicators of seed quality. Canonical discriminant analysis and MANOVA confirmed significant treatment differences, highlighting the influence of inoculation strategies on seed physiology. Overall, co-inoculation with Rhizobium tropici and Azospirillum brasilense (particularly in T7) demonstrated potential to improve seed quality at lower cost, offering sustainable alternatives for optimizing agricultural production."

      "abstract": "Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) has been widely grown as a cash crop. However, the molecular mechanism by which it responds to cold stress at the seed germination stage is still largely unknown. In this study, we performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis between the cold-tolerant cultivar XCq and cold-sensitive cultivar QCq in response to cold stress. A total number of 4552 and 4845 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in XCq and QCq upon the treatment of cold stress, respectively. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis demonstrated that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway was identified only among the up-regulated DEGs in XCq.The expression of DEGs, which encoding transcription factors, such as AP2/ERF, bHLH, bZIP, MYB, ICEs, and CORs related to cold response, were higher in XCq than in QCq in response to cold stress. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) showed that DEGs clustered in the co-expression modules positively correlated with the factors of quinoa variety and temperature were significantly enriched in the oxidative phosphorylation metabolic pathway. Further physiochemical analyses showed that the activities of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase as well as the contents of soluble protein and sugar, were significantly higher in XCq than in QCq. In summary, MAPK signaling and oxidative metabolism were the key pathways in quinoa upon cold stress. Our findings revealed that the enhanced activities of antioxidant enzymes alleviate the lipid peroxidation of membranes and promote the accumulation of osmotic adjustment substances, thereby enabling seeds to better resist oxidative damage under cold stress."

      "abstract": "The present study aimed to investigate the effects of exogenous carnitine treatments on maize seed germination by stimulating lipid metabolism and regulating the mitochondrial respiratory pathway. Maize seeds were grown as control, 5, 7.5, and 10 μM carnitine treatment groups in a germination chamber at 25 °C under dark conditions for 5 d. It was determined that carnitine treatments increased the germination rate (GR), germination index (GI), germination potential (GP), vigor index (VI), root and hypocotyl length, fresh weight (FW), and content of total soluble protein but decreased the total carbohydrate content. It was also found that it increased the activities of α-amylase, isocitrate lyase (ICL), and malate synthase (MS) enzymes, which are critical in the germination process, and upregulated the expression of ICL and MS genes. To clarify the potential of carnitine treatments to promote the participation of lipids in respiration in roots and hypocotyls, lipase, carnitine acyltransferases (CATI and CATII), and citrate synthase (CS) enzyme activities were examined, and significant increases in these activities were detected. It was also found that gene levels of respiratory enzymes cytochrome oxidase (COX), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), and Atp synthase, lipase, and CS proteins were upregulated by carnitine treatment. In support of the enzyme and gene change findings, significant changes were determined in fatty acid contents, free carnitine, and long-chain acylcarnitine levels in seeds, roots, and hypocotyls depending on carnitine application. In roots and hypocotyls, carnitine treatments significantly increased glutamine synthase (GS) and glutamate dehydrogenase (NADH-GDH) activities and gene expression levels, which are closely related to the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). It was also noted that all proteins analyzed at the gene expression level were upregulated by carnitine applications in seeds. In addition, significant increases were recorded in antioxidant enzyme ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities and total ascorbate (AsA) and glutathione (GSH) contents in roots and hypocotyls, while decreases were determined in guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) and catalase activities. Significant changes were recorded in all parameters examined, especially with 7.5 µM carnitine application. The findings suggest that carnitine may promote the transport of fatty acids to mitochondrial respiration by accelerating lipid catabolism in five-day-old maize and contribute to seed germination and growth and development processes by activating other metabolic pathways associated with respiration in this process."

This work demonstrated that ethylene treatment increased melatonin biosynthesis by inducing the VvASMT expression in grape seeds. Ethylene-induced VvERF5 transactivated VvASMT via binding to the ethylene response element in its promoter. VvERF5 overexpression led to an increase in melatonin biosynthesis while its suppression generated the opposite results in grape seeds, calli, and/or Arabidopsis seeds. A melatonin-responsive element (MTRE) was identified, and melatonin-induced VvERF104 was found to bind to the MTRE of the VvMYB14 promoter and activate its expression. VvMYB14 overexpression widely modified the expression of genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway and phenolic compound content in grape seeds. DNA affinity purification sequencing revealed that the MEME-1 motif was the most likely binding sites of VvMYB14. VvPAL, VvC4H, and VvCHS were verified to be the target genes of VvMYB14. Additionally, the overexpression of VvERF5 or VvERF104 increased the expression of VvPAL, VvC4H, and VvCHS, as well as the levels of the corresponding metabolites. Moreover, the roles of VvERF5, VvASMT, and VvERF104 in mediating ethylene-induced changes in the phenylpropanoid pathway were elucidated using their suppressing seeds. Collectively, ethylene increased the VvMYB14 expression via the pathway of ERF5-melatonin-ERF104 and thereby modified the phenylpropanoid pathway."

Given the susceptibility of sprouts to microbial contamination during germination, improved interventions were needed to enhance food safety without compromising product quality. NBIT and NCR were applied to Salmonella-inoculated seeds at high (6.3 log CFU/g) and low (2.4 log CFU/g) inoculum levels and their impact on Salmonella populations, seed germination, sprout quality (length and weight), and visual appearance was assessed. Results revealed that both NBIT and NCR significantly reduced Salmonella populations and most treatments did not adversely affect seed germination or sprout quality. Treatment with 2.0% NBIT achieved reductions of up to 2.4 log CFU/g on seeds and 6.4 log CFU/g on sprouts after 4 days at the low inoculum level. However, treatment with 2.0% NBIT resulted in an 18.8% reduction in germination that occurred at the high inoculum level and a 10.7% reduction at the low inoculum level, along with a slight decrease in sprout size. In contrast, treatments with 0.5% and 1.0% NBIT, as well as 2.0% NCR, reduced Salmonella on seeds by 1.5-2.0 log CFU/g, regardless of inoculum level, and achieved reductions of 5.0-6.4 log CFU/g on sprouts at the low inoculum level. In addition, NBIT (0.5% and 1.0%) and NCR (2.0%) preserved seed germination rates and sprout quality metrics, including length, weight, and visual appearance, comparable with untreated controls. These findings highlight the potential of NBIT and NCR as effective antimicrobial agents for improving the microbial safety of alfalfa sprouts without compromising quality."

      "abstract": "A current study investigated the effects of smoking (Cigarettes and Water-pipes) on the lung and cardiac ventricles by comparing the cytotoxic effects of smoking with certain natural antioxidants. 56 male albino rats were randomly assigned to 7 groups (N = 8 per group). Group 1 was a negative control that was exposed to fresh air; Group 2 was a positive group exposed to the most popular cigarette brands in the Jordanian market (red LM cigarettes) for 30 consecutive days, one cigarette per rat. Groups 3 and 4 were exposed to a cigarette smoking treatment with one of the natural antioxidants (vitamin C, Ammi Visnagia seed extract, respectively). Rats in group 5 were exposed to flavored water-pipe smoke resulting from the complete burning of 20 g from one coastal for 30 days, one session a day, and groups 6-7 were exposed to cigarette smoking with treatment with one of the selected natural antioxidants (Ascorbic acid vitamin C, Ammi Visnagia seed extract). According to immunohistochemistry investigations, smoking exposure has been linked to negative tissue consequences. Both types of smoking models induced the expression of the p53 protein in heart and lung tissues. However, p53 was mildly expressed in the heart and considerably in the lung. In conclusion, investigations were conducted on the impact of smoking on different levels, such as histological changes in the trachea, lung, and heart ventricle, as well as its influence on the expression of the p53 protein. The administration of Ammi Visnaga seed extract and Ascorbic acid exhibited protective effects against the detrimental effects of smoking through all the aforementioned methods.",

The aim of this study was to improve seed quality and seedling growth of T. incarnatum using eco-friendly treatments. Tests were carried out under laboratory and field conditions, using hot water and air-drying temperatures. Seed quality parameters included germinated seeds, dormant seeds, dead seeds, seedling growth, and abnormal seedlings, all expressed as percentages. The water absorption test confirmed the presence of physical seed dormancy in crimson clover. The best results were achieved with a 30-min hot water treatment, which increased water absorption and reduced the percentage of dormant seeds. Longer exposure times increased the percentage of dead seeds and abnormal seedlings, whereas shorter exposure times increased the percentage of dormant seeds and reduced germination. There was strong agreement between the germination results obtained under laboratory and field conditions. These findings illustrate new biotechnological approaches to enhancing seed quality."

      "abstract": "Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is a globally prevalent disease, yet achieving dual repair of tissue and function presents significant challenges. Considering reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a primary cause of IVDD, and given the decrease of nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) and extensive degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) during IVDD development, the present study, inspired by the \"seeds-and-soil\" strategy, has developed NPCs-loaded TBA@Gel&Chs hydrogel microspheres. These microspheres serve as exogenous supplements of NPCs and ECM analogs, replenishing \"seeds\" and \"soil\" for nucleus pulposus repair, and incorporating polyphenol antioxidant components to interrupt the oxidative stress-IVDD cycle, thereby constructing a microsphere system where NPCs and ECM support each other. Experiments proved that TBA@Gel&Chs exhibited significant extracellular ROS-scavenging antioxidant capabilities while effectively upregulating intracellular antioxidant proteins expression (Sirt3 and Sod2). This dual-action antioxidant capability effectively protects the vitality and physiological functions of NPCs. The therapeutic effects of microspheres on IVDD were also confirmed in rat models, which was found significantly restore histological structure and mechanical properties of degenerated discs. Additionally, RNA-seq results have provided evidences of antioxidant mechanism by which TBA@Gel&Chs protected NPCs from oxidative stress. Therefore, the NPCs-loaded TBA@Gel&Chs microspheres developed in this study have achieved excellent therapeutic effects, offering a paradigm using antioxidant biomaterials combined with cellular therapy for IVDD treatment."

To promote the benefits for the mountain economy, we report on the nutritional values (crude proteins, lipids, moisture, ash and total amino acids), metabolic traits (free amino acids, fatty acids and bioactive organic compounds) and mineral content of 'segale del Matese' seeds. Seeds were collected in 2023 and 2024 at two altitudes (~1000 and 150 m a.s.l.); these were analyzed, and the results were compared. Average data from two sites (crude proteins (9.6 g/100 g), lipids (1.3 g/100 g), ash (1.8 g/100 g), moisture (9.3 g/100 g) and carbohydrates (78.3 g/100 g)) show few significant statistical differences. The same trend was observed for total amino acid content, except for Glx (glutamic and glutamine), while statistical differences between the two sites were found among proteinogenic free amino acids. Moreover, segale del Matese' is rich in polyunsaturated (linoleic and linoleic) and monounsaturated (oleic) fatty acids. Furthermore, total phenolic content, some bioactive compounds (i.e., gallic acid, vanillic acid, p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid) and radical scavenging activity were estimated. Finally, the seeds subjected to thermal treatment showed a decrease in anti-trypsin and anti-chymotrypsin activities, resulting in a favorable depletion of antinutritional factors."

The main antibacterial components of P. speciosa seeds, cyclic polysulfides were characterized using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry analysis and evaluated using a broth microdilution method against seven gram-positive and five gram-negative bacterial strains. Microwaving displayed the highest decrease in TPC, followed by boiling, while steaming retained most TPC. Thermal treatment did not affect DPPH free radical scavenging activity but significantly reduced the FRAP of the seeds. Uncooked seeds exhibited significant antibacterial activity against the 12 bacterial strains with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 5-40 mg/mL. Thermal treatment of the seeds displayed reduced antibacterial activity, a decreased amount of 1,2,4,5-tetrathiane whereas 1,3,5-trithiane and 1,2,5,6-tetrathiocane were detected.",

      "abstract": "Porous starch, known for its large specific surface area due to internal pores, exhibits excellent adsorption capabilities. In this study, we successfully produced porous starch from lotus seeds using dextranase and conducted a comprehensive analysis of its surface morphology, crystalline structure, pasting behavior, and adsorption characteristics. The enzymatic treatment resulted in the development of a pore structure on the lotus seed starch (LS) surface without altering its crystalline structure, as confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The oil and water absorption capacities of the porous starch increased by 14% and 27%, respectively. Differential scanning calorimetry indicated a higher pasting temperature for the porous starch. This starch exhibited remarkable drug-carrying capabilities, absorbing up to 18.23 mg/g of proanthocyanidins and significantly shielding them from UV damage. In vitro release tests in simulated intestinal fluid revealed that the encapsulated proanthocyanidins (PC) achieved nearly complete release. These results underscore the potential of LS as a drug carrier and provide valuable insights for developing innovative intestinal drug delivery systems."

Indian Sandbur seeds, known as Bharunt locally, are frequently encountered in the larynx of individuals residing in the arid regions of Rajasthan and Punjab. A retrospective observational study was conducted on 50 patients with aerodigestive foreign bodies who presented to the ENT OPD at Sawai Man Singh Medical College, Jaipur, from May 2021 to July 2022. Demographic information, preoperative telelaryngoscopy pictures, and intraoperative findings were collected from medical records. 13 patients with Indian sandbur seeds as foreign bodies were included in the study. The mean age was 24.5 years, with the majority in the age group of 20-25 years. Most patients resided in dry areas and were engaged in farming or outdoor occupations. The most common complaints were change in voice and throat pain. The true vocal cords were the most common site of lodging of foreign bodies. The majority of patients presented within three to six hours of ingesting the foreign body. The presence of Indian sandbur seeds as foreign bodies in the larynx is an overlooked public health concern. Early detection and prompt treatment are essential to prevent complications. Public awareness and collaboration with government bodies are necessary to address this issue effectively."

      "abstract": "A capacity for reliable germination under elevated temperatures is a crucial factor in maintaining the stability of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) yields in the context of climate change. Although the environment of the parent plant during growth is a known factor affecting seed germinability, the effect of this environment on the heat tolerance of wheat seeds has not been investigated in detail. To investigate the effect of exposure to high temperatures during growth, plants were exposed to 38°C at various growth stages. In germination test, seeds exposed to heat during their development had better heat germinability than the control. On the other hand, high temperatures before the seed development stage resulted in a lower temperature germinability compared to the control. To identify critical factors that altered heat germinability, we analyzed heat shock protein expression, fatty acid composition, and metabolite profiles. High-temperature treatment during seed formation increased the expression of heat shock proteins and reduced the degree of unsaturation of fatty acids in the seeds, which may enhance the ability of seeds to survive and germinate at high temperatures. There was a significant treatment effect on the overall metabolite content of the seeds. PLS regression analysis using the germination test results revealed that taurine, thymidine, beta-alanine, sinapic acid, and deoxyguanosine contributed significantly to germination rate. These findings suggest that the combined influence of these metabolites may play a role in acquiring seed germinability under high-temperature conditions during the growth period of the parent plants. These findings suggest potential components of a molecular mechanism in bread wheat that is triggered by high temperature during seed development and results in the acquisition of heat germinability."

This study investigated the germination ecophysiology of L. mulleri and the possible presence of dormancy by using 7000 seeds, providing useful information for conservation strategies. The germination response of fresh seeds was evaluated under different temperatures, photoperiods, pre-treatments [cold stratification (C); warm stratification (W); W+C; C+W+C; dry after-ripening (DAR)], and different gibberellic acid (GA3) concentrations. L. mulleri germinated under controlled conditions, particularly at 15 and 20 °C, while germination percentages (GP) never exceeded 5% at 5 and 30 °C. C and C+W+C induced secondary dormancy, delaying germination, whereas W, DAR, and GA3 stimulate it. Light and dark incubation showed no significant differences in regards to GP. W, DAR, and 250 mg/L GA3 effectively overcame physiological dormancy (PD), expanding the germination temperature range to below 10 and above 25 °C. These responses suggested type 3 non-deep PD, as germination temperatures extended from a moderate range to both low and high temperatures. Analyzing 7000 seeds provided crucial information regarding dormancy and germination strategies, supporting both ex situ and in situ conservation efforts."

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of organic acids on the microstructure of cacao seeds under specific operating conditions that emphasize cacao quality-related characteristics. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were employed to describe the seed microstructure and characterize the presence of autofluorescent cellular components through image analysis, as well as to obtain the fractal dimension and texture parameters of the seeds. The results revealed significant differences in the microstructural characteristics of the seeds among the different treatments applied. Acetic acid treatment increased membrane permeability, causing a reduction in cell volume. In contrast, lactic acid treatment resulted in the formation of smaller vacuolar inclusions of anthocyanins within the cotyledon, accompanied by a higher presence of phenolic compound aggregates. Conversely, the controlled transformation using citric acid resulted in minimal cell damage to the seed structures, resulting in a more uniform and homogeneous texture. These findings provide valuable insights into the microstructural changes induced by organic acids and their potential to improve cacao processing methods, focusing on enhancing quality-related aspects vital for developing cacao products."

Eruca vesicaria is an edible year-round plant that contains a lot of health-promoting phytochemicals and is an excellent source of antioxidants. So, the present investigation was planned to assess the effect of E. vesicaria seed essential oil versus acetamiprid-induced toxicity in rats. Animals were partitioned into 4 groups of seven each: control, E. vesicaria seeds essential oil (ESEO; 0.17 mL/kg), acetamiprid (Aceta; 21.7 mg/kg), and ESEO plus Aceta, respectively. Doses were given orally and daily for 14 days. Results revealed that ESEO has many phytochemical components with high antioxidant activity. Data showed that treatment with Aceta increased lipid peroxidation and decreased the activities of \"enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants\" in kidney homogenate. Also, disturbance of kidney and liver function biomarkers, lipid profile, and protein content were observed. These are confirmed by the histological, molecular (Cox-2, TNF-α, and PPAR-α), and renal damage biomarkers (KIM-1 and Cystatin C) examination. On the other hand, rats administered ESEO and then treated with Aceta showed significant amelioration in most of the examined indices. To sum up, ESEO has a potent anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and antioxidant activity that protects against the pronounced harmful effects of Aceta in rat kidneys due to its health-promoting phytochemicals."

Despite the prevalence of obesity, there is currently no data available on the anti-obesity and metabolic effects of Papaver somniferum. The objective of the study was to confirm the anti-obesity and metabolic effects of Papaver somniferum (poppy) seeds in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese rats, assessing their impact on weight reduction, lipid profile, and organ toxicity. The experiment was conducted in two phases: a 4 week poppy seed intervention and a 6 week obesity induction trial. Rats were separated into groups and given both washed or unwashed poppy seeds, HFD, and a prescription medication for weight loss. The findings demonstrated that washing poppy seeds significantly decreased weight gain and enhanced lipid profiles, particularly reducing triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Additionally, treated groups showed a decrease in glucose levels. However, higher doses of unwashed poppy seeds caused modest liver stress, indicated by raised alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels and renal histopathology showed mild inflammation, but hematological parameters were constant. These results suggest that washed poppy seeds may have the potential to reduce obesity and enhance metabolic health without adverse harm, indicating the need for further research to explore their therapeutic potential.",

      "abstract": "Abundant direct and in-direct genes are involved in regulating sexual hormones, and reproductive process under nitrite antioxidant plants in rabbit feed. However, there is not enough information about the role of chia seeds and matcha tea as anti-oxidative plants inhibit some direct and in-direct genes related to puberty of growing male rabbits. In this study New-Zealand White (NZW) rabbits treated with chia seeds and matcha tea in water from age after weaning to marketing age about two months ago and determent some sexual hormones, direct and in-direct genes related to puberty and reproduction process. Our data showed total testosterone measured by ELISA increased significantly in chia rabbits compared to control. ELISA analysis revealed that there were no alterations in the levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) in the treated groups. Direct genes such as doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1 (DMRT1), sex-determining region Y protein (SRY), and gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (GnRH1) determent by qPCR show up-regulating in matcha groups comparable to control group. While in-direct genes follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) and estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) detected by qPCR showed up-regulated in matcha rabbits compared to control rabbits. But, luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) gene was down-regulated in matcha group, and it was up-regulated in chia seeds groups. The prolactin receptor (PRLR) gene investigates down-regulation in all treatment groups. Collectively, matcha tea as one of antioxidant plants were involved those genes studied and activated via hypothalamic- pituitary gonadal axis and led to early puberty in growing male NZW rabbits.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Seed storage globulins have two subunits linked by disulfide bonds. Earlier studies suggested that globulin hydrolysis may enhance the freezing tolerance of hydrated seeds. As a donor for H2S, NaHS can act as a nucleophile to break the disulfide bond of proteins and convert sulfhydryl group (-SH) of cysteine to the persulfide group (-SSH), which will promote formation of S-persulfidation and de-polymerization of seed globulins. OBJECTIVE: To examine the role of the H2S signal pathway in the freezing tolerance of hydrated brassica seeds. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hydrated brassica (Brassica oleracea) seeds were treated with 5 mM NaHS to reduce the disulfide bonds of seed globulins and its effect on seed freezing tolerance was investigated. RESULTS: NaHS treatment increased embryo supercooling as determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and seed survival upon slow cooling (control vs NaHS, 30.0% vs 45.3%). NaHS treatment resulted in a significant increase of sulfhydryl groups of storage globulin, indicating the reduction of disulfide bonds. The 2D electrophoresis showed the depolymerization of storage globulins and the accumulation of small polypeptides. In addition, NaHS treatment increased the contents of ascorbate and glutathione for anti-oxidation. CONCLUSION: The H2S signal pathway is likely involved in the freezing tolerance of hydrated brassica seeds via the de-polymerization and hydrolysis of seed storage globulins, as well as the regulation of supercooling.

In vitro antioxidant assays such as DPPH, ABTS cation scavenger, FRAP, ORAC, and TPC, and 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiation were performed. The results of these assays show that ethyl acetate fraction of cumin seeds (CSEA) had significantly superior antioxidant activity compared to other cumin seeds fractions. Thymol, benzyl alcohol, and 2-methyl-3-phenylpropanal were analyzed as major volatile components in CSEA. Treatment of 50 and 75 μg/mL CSEA inhibited fat accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes significantly (p < 0.05). When 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with CSEA at 75 μg/mL, the expressions of genes and proteins related to fat differentiation and accumulation were significantly reduced (p < 0.05). Therefore, CSEA could be used as antioxidants and as a functional ingredient in anti-adipogenic formulations."

The study collected peripheral blood from pancreatic cancer patients, and detected the expression of RBM15 and KLF5 expression in the serum of pancreatic cancer patients before and after 125I seed irradiation. An in vitro study was conducted to investigate the effects 125I seed irradiation on the malignant behavior and glycolysis of pancreatic cancer cells. The underlying mechanisms were thoroughly examined through a series of logical experiments, including Western blot analysis, Dot-blot experiment, methylated RNA immunoprecipitation assay, and RNA pull down assay. A xenograft tumor model in nude mice was established and treated with 125I seed irradiation, which was employed to research the in vivo effect and mechanism of 125I seed irradiation for pancreatic cancer. The overexpressed RBM15 and KLF5 in serum of pancreatic cancer patients were reduced after 125I seed treatment. 125I seed treatment impaired pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and invasion; enhanced apoptosis; attenuated glycolysis; and reduced RBM15 and KLF5 expression. RBM15 overexpression partially reversed these influences of 125I seed treatment on pancreatic cancer cells. RBM15 was capable of increasing KLF5 expression, which might be achieved by promoting m6A methylation of KLF5. In vivo, 125I seed treatment blocked the growth of pancreatic cancer cells and decreased RBM15 and KLF5 expression in xenograft tumor, whereas RBM15 overexpression abolished these effects. 125I seed irradiation suppressed glycolysis in pancreatic cancer by inhibiting KLF5 m6A methylation through down-regulation of RBM15. This discovery established a solid foundation for the use of in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.",

Current work aims at exploring how paozhi treatment tailors the composite behavior and physicochemical properties of coix seed starch-oils mixtures system, through inspecting the interactions between starch and oils under simulated sand frying conditions. The results indicate that processing induces significant morphological changes, leading to the formation of a porous starch-like structure. During this process, oils interact with starch molecules, facilitating the reorganization of the starch matrix and the formation of starch-lipid complexes (V-type inclusion complexes) as well as starch-lipid aggregates (oil is physically trapped). These structural changes, in conjunction with the interactions between water and oil, enhance the gelatinization properties and promote the slowly digestible characteristics of the sand-fried coix seed system, resulting in a gradual release of oil components. This study provides a foundation for further investigation into the mechanisms underlying the processing of starch-rich medicinal and food crops and their implications for health and nutrition."

The genetic and metabolic stability of the plants was also assessed. METHODS: Nodal segments of Chrysanthemum × morifolium /Ramat./ Hemsl. 'Richmond', with a single axillary bud, were encapsulated in 3% calcium alginate with the addition of IAA (1 mg·L-1) and/or NPs (7.7 mg·L-1). The synthetic seeds were cultured in vitro for 30 or 60 days on a water-agar medium and then transplanted to the greenhouse for further analyses. RESULTS: Results indicated that IAA and Fe3O4CA NPs applied singularly significantly enhanced germination rates (83.33-92.18%) compared with the IAA- and NP-free control (56.67-64.18%), regardless of treatment time. The simultaneous use of IAA and Fe3O4CA NPs promoted longer shoot development after 30 days of treatment but showed negative effects after extended exposure. The same combination improved rooting efficiency compared to IAA alone. Supplementation with NPs improved acclimatization rates for younger plants but had variable effects on older plants. Leaf growth metrics were enhanced with Fe3O4CA NPs in plants after 30 days of treatment, yet no significant differences were observed in leaf dimensions after 60 days. The content of flavonoids, anthocyanins, and chlorophyll was affected by the exposure duration. Biochemical analyses revealed increased total polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity (FRAP, ABTS) in treated plants, particularly with IAA and Fe3O4CA NPs. Start codon targeted (SCoT) analyses showed no polymorphisms among treated plants, confirming their genetic stability. CONCLUSION: The study found that the combination of IAA and Fe3O4CA NPs improved germination and shoot development in chrysanthemum synthetic seeds, while maintaining genetic stability, although prolonged exposure negatively affected plant growth metrics."

Whether initiating complementary feeding (CF) with sweet-tasting foods impacts the taste of later dietary patterns remains unknown. This study combined a quantitative taste intensity database with dietary assessment methods to investigate this. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate whether initiating CF in infants with sweet compared with neutral-tasting foods leads to different dietary taste patterns at 12-36 mo. METHODS: A total of 246 Dutch infants (age 20.2 ± 1.8 wk, 129 girls) participated in an randomized control trial; they received either sweet-tasting (n = 125) or neutral-tasting (n = 121) fruit and vegetable purees during the first 15 d of initial CF. Dietary intake was assessed at 12, 18, 24, and 36 mo using 3 24-h recalls. Reported foods (n = 1277) were grouped into 5 clusters-\"sour-sweet,\" \"sweet-fatty,\" \"fatty-salty,\" \"fatty,\" and \"neutral\" tasting foods-based on their taste intensity values using K-means clustering. Dietary taste patterns were calculated as the average daily intake of energy (%kcal) and weight (%grams) from each taste cluster and compared between intervention groups. RESULTS: Overall, children's energy intake from neutral-tasting foods decreased from 61% ± 11% at 12 mo to 44% ± 12% at 36 mo (P < 0.001). Weight intake from neutral foods also declined (from 74% ± 9% to 62% ± 13%, P < 0.001). Conversely, children's energy intake from sweet-fatty, fatty-salty, and fatty foods increased significantly over the study period (from 12% ± 7% to 21% ± 10%, from 8% ± 6% to 13% ± 7%, and from 7% ± 5% to 11% ± 6%, respectively, all P ≤ 0.01). No differences were observed between the 2 intervention groups. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, children's diets became more diverse and intense in taste but exposure to sweet taste during early CF did not influence the dietary taste patterns in later childhood.

Different ultrasound powers (250, 350, 450, 550, 650 W) and times (20, 25, 30, 35, 40 min) were applied to assess these effects. Among these treatments, the ultrasonic treatment of 350 W for 30 min led to an increase in surface hydrophobicity, a significant reduction in average particle size, and enhanced the solubility, emulsifying capacity, and foaming properties of SBSP. Furthermore, the secondary and tertiary structures of SBSP underwent changes during the ultrasound treatment, with a decrease in α-helix content and a 17.5% increase in β-sheet content. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed a reduction in SBSP crystallinity. The in vitro digestibility of the protein was also improved, while the content of undesirable volatile flavor compounds was reduced during extraction. Thus, ultrasound-assisted pretreatment proves to be an effective method for extracting SBSP, improving its functional properties, and providing important implications for the application of SBSP in food products.",

Flax seeds can be added to foods during production either before or after heat pre-treatment (roasting), creating the need for thermally stable peptides as markers for flax seed identification. In this study, the proteins of untreated and roasted seeds of three flax cultivars (Jantarol, Oliwin and Szafir) were analyzed by high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS) to search for species-specific peptides as potential markers of flax seeds. RESULTS: Twenty-three proteins found in untreated seeds of each cultivar were selected using UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. After roasting, six of them were identified based on 13 unique and species-specific peptides, and they have been suggested as potential thermally stable species-specific markers for the identification of flax seed proteins. Among them, one new unique and thermally stable peptide, DPVLAWR, was found that had not been identified in previous studies. CONCLUSION: Our research has provided novel information on the protein and peptide identification of flax seeds taking into account possible cultivar diversity. In the study, the proteomics UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS method was applied. In addition, heat-stable peptides were determined as a potential indicator for the identification of flax seeds after roasting, a process often used for oilseed pre-treatment. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry."

      "abstract": "Gamma rays are a powerful tool for enhancing crop quality and production. They can cause mutations that improve plant traits and are commonly used in agriculture. The present study aimed to examine the effects of gamma irradiation on maize hybrids' triple white seeds (Giza 321) using different doses (10, 20, and 50 Gy) from different radiation sources 60Co or 137Cs). The maize treated with gamma rays from the Co-60 source at 10 Gy exhibited the lowest shoot length percentage of 37.5%, compared to control groups, while root lengths were unaffected at 10 and 50 Gy Cs-137 doses. In addition, the study revealed that gamma irradiation stimulated the excess production of proline, protein, and antioxidant enzymes, which revealed the defense strategy of the plant that tolerates stress. The study also revealed that gamma rays caused a significant reduction in chlorophyll content for all doses, while carotenoid content increased. DNA tail length indicated that minimal damage occurred at 50 Gy of 60Co and 137Cs, respectively. Moreover, the analysis of tail DNA% and tail moment showed that the lowest damage was determined for 20 Gy of 60Co and 137Cs, respectively. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the 20 Gy Co treatments had the largest number of bands (15), while the 20 Gy Cs dose had the minimum number of bands (10). Ultimately, the proline content and peroxidase enzymes respond exponentially with the dose, making them potential radiation biomarkers for dosimetric purposes. However, further dosimetric features of these two parameters are necessary to be defined in future work. The present results showed that the treatment of plants with gamma rays enhanced the defense system of the maize at a specific dose, thereby, a large-scale study is recommended for using this radiation to enhance the defense and/or the tolerance of a wide range of crops as well as evaluate its safety, applicability, and reproducibility at field scale.",

      "abstract": "Unlike the Himalayas, the sub-Himalayan zones did not experience snowfall and thus suitable for growing solanaceous vegetables. However, several cold waves have been reported to affect the district of Coochbehar (West Bengal, India), which belongs to the Cwa zone (as per Koppen's classification). Variable duration of sub-optimal soil temperature can have a detrimental effect on the growth of seedlings. Our previous study demonstrates that a constant temperature of 20°C (6 degrees below the optimal soil temperature) causes a 71% loss of vigor in seeds of solanaceous plants. Since the soil temperature is not constant diurnally, it was hypothesized that the duration of cold stress can have variable effects on vigor of Capsicum annuum L. It was observed that increasing the duration of cold stress (18 °C) up to 2 hours/day can improve the vigor but after 6 hours/day, a significant drop in vigor was observed. This was because of the cold-associated membrane damage leading to the leakage of electrolytes. To date, this stress existing in these regions has gone unnoticed. In this regard, biopriming the seeds with exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing microbes can be useful as the EPS can form a protective layer on the seeds. Two lesser-known bacteria namely, Phytobacter and Priestia sp. were evaluated for their vigor-recovering ability. Treatment of seed with these microbes reduced the electrolyte leakage which improved the vigor under sub-optimal stress. This was also validated by fluorescent microscopy. Both these strains displayed an enhanced EPS-producing ability at 18°C which correlated with the reduced electrolyte leakage and enhanced stability of cell membrane. Such bacteria can help in promoting seed vigor under sub-optimal temperature stress.",

We investigated overcoming the dormancy using several different sources of non-thermal plasma, which, by modifying, etching, or disrupting the waxy seed coat, allowed water to penetrate the seeds and initiate germination. All plasma sources tested enhanced seed germination to varying degrees, with over 80% germination observed when using a dielectric barrier discharge, while control seeds showed no germination. Non-thermal plasma treatment significantly decreased the water contact angle of the seed surface from an initial 120° (for untreated seeds) to complete wetting when using a dielectric barrier discharge or atmospheric-pressure plasma jet. The experiments indicate two mechanisms for the modification of the waxy seed coat by a non-thermal plasma: hydrophilization of the wax surface through the binding of oxygen particles and etching of narrow channels in the wax layer, allowing water to penetrate the seed."

      "abstract": "Here, we report the primary structure of hortensin 4, main type 1 ribosome inactivating protein (RIP) isolated from Atriplex hortensis seeds. The complete sequencing was achieved by a combination of mass spectrometry coupled with Edman degradation. The amino acid sequence of hortensin 4 matches with that of Atriplex patens type 1 RIP, deduced from the cDNA sequence (AC: ABJ90432.1). The protein consists of 254 amino acid residues, without cysteinyl residues and a N-Acetylhexosamine chain at position Asn231. Structural studies (CD spectrum and 3D model) show a protein core typical of RIPs, and the amino acid residues of active site are conserved. In addition, to get insight into the protective effects of hortensin 4 against pathogens and its putative biotechnological applications, we evaluated the: i) N-glycosylase activity against the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) RNA; (ii) antifungal activity towards Trichoderma harzianum and Botrytis cinerea, by damaging fungal ribosomes; and (iii) inhibition of human primary glioblastoma NULU cells proliferation, with cytotoxicity enhanced in the presence of temozolomide, used as a chemotherapeutic agent. Altogether, the multiple biological activities of hortensin 4 could be exploited both to improve the resistance to various pathogens by engineering transgenic plants and to develop useful tools for cancer therapy."

The phytochemical composition of the extract was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. To study the hypoglycemic effect, the activity of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase) and markers of oxidative stress (malondialdehyde and 8-hydroxy-2-desoxyguanosine) were evaluated in the model of diabetes mellitus induced by nicotinamide and streptozotocin in rats. The vasodilatory effect of the extract was tested in rat aortic rings. The ethanolic extract of seeds of Swietenia humilis showed antioxidant, hypoglycemic, and endothelium-independent vasorelaxant effects, probably by blocking calcium transport, likely due to ursolic acid and α-amyrin, phytochemical compounds more abundant in the extract.",

Edible coatings, thin membranes produced directly on the desired surface, could improve food preservation, among other properties. Annatto (Bixa orellana L.) seeds are natural pigments with high antioxidant activity. This work aimed to develop a pectin-based edible coating with annatto extract to increase the shelf life of fruits, using mulberries as a study model. The mulberries were randomly separated into five groups: without coating, coated with different extract concentrations (0%, 5%, and 10%), and a layer-by-layer treatment consisting of a pectin layer under a 10% extract layer. The samples were evaluated for the following parameters: titratable acidity, maturity index, mass loss, pH, soluble solids, moisture contents, and bioactive compounds. The coated group with 10% annatto extract had the best result for the maturity index (25.52), while the group with 5% showed better mass loss and moisture (37.28% and 83.66%, respectively). Herein, it was demonstrated that pectin-based edible coatings with annatto extract delay the maturation and senescence of mulberries, preserving the bioactive compounds and increasing shelf life."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Seed-borne diseases have seriously affected the sustainability of sorghum cultivation in China as the demand for organic products in the winemaking industry has limited the use of chemical fungicides. RESULTS: This study conducted a comprehensive analysis of fungal diversity in sorghum seeds from three major growing regions in Guizhou Province. Using a combination of traditional tissue separation and high-throughput sequencing, we identified Colletotrichum, Fusarium, Cladosporium, and Alternaria as dominant fungi. Pathogenicity tests revealed that strains GD202206, GD202219, and GD202242 were pathogenic and were identified as C. sublineola through morphological and multi-locus phylogeny analysis (ITS、CAPDH、ACT、CHS-1 and TUB2). 16 fungicides for seed priming experiments with sorghum seeds, the results indicated that priming with KHCO₃ significantly enhanced germination of the sorghum seeds, with both indoor and outdoor emergence rates notably higher. Analysis of the fungal changes before and after KHCO₃ priming revealed a significant reduction in the abundance of the Colletotrichum genus. Additionally, KHCO₃ altered the community structure of fungi within the sorghum seeds, reducing population richness. Inter-generic relationships were rebalanced, with antagonism decreased and synergy increased following KHCO₃ treatment. Non-target metabolomic analysis indicated that KHCO₃ enhances sorghum seed germination via the phenylalanine and flavonoid pathways and exhibits antifungal properties through the cyanoamino acid metabolic pathway. CONCLUSION: This study identified C. sublineola as the primary pathogenic fungus carried by sorghum seeds. KHCO₃ treatment has a dual effect on sorghum seeds: on one hand, it suppresses pathogen transmission by reducing the abundance of the Colletotrichum genus; on the other hand, it promotes germination and seedling emergence, thereby enhancing both germination and emergence rates.",

      "abstract": "Plasma discharges have been used as a treatment for seeds for a variety of food, horticultural and agricultural applications. It has generally been reported that plasma exposure increases the seed's water wettability, with some studies reporting increased water imbibition by seeds. It is speculated that increased water imbibition after plasma treatment is related to increased germination especially for food crops, yet there is little mechanistic understanding of why this may be so. Moreover, it is not well understood why plasma affects different plant species' seed in different ways. In this study, the objective was to develop a mechanistic understanding of how plasma exposure influences water transport in seeds/grains from different plant species. We exposed seeds to plasma and then analysed water absorption curves using modelling to extract thermodynamic constants related to the kinetics of water transport. The resulting quantitative data provided a clear understanding how plasma treatments increased the rate and amount of water uptake. We also discovered that with increasing plasma exposure, the rates at which water enters the seed changes depending on diffusional and capillary pathways. These insights help to explain why different seeds respond to plasma exposure in a variety of ways. Conclusions from water modelling studies were consistent with observed changes from microscopy and dye imbibition assays. This approach to analysing quantitative water transport phenomena after plasma exposure provides a method to mechanistically understand how plasma affects water imbibition in seeds with differing physiology. We discuss the relevance to food applications, and we believe results will be relevant to future studies of how to best apply plasma treatments to increase germination for food crops.",

Elaeocarpus angustifolius Blume, a plant traditionally used in India for neurological disorders, was investigated for its therapeutic potential in AD. E. angustifolius alkaloid-rich fraction (EAF) was analysed using LCMS and GCMS, identifying 66 phytochemicals. Compounds were evaluated using Schrodinger software against key AD targets obtained from Protein Data Bank (PDB), including recombinant human acetylcholinesterase (PDB ID: 4EY7), β-secretase (PDB ID: 6C2I), TNF-α converting enzyme (PDB ID: 2FV5), glycogen synthase kinase 3 (PDB ID: 1Q5K), and amyloid-β precursor protein (PDB ID: 1AAP). Among the identified compounds, (+)-Elaeocarpine, Genistein, Caffeic acid, Avenalumic acid, Verimol A, Apigenin 7-glucoside, and (1xi,3xi)-1,2,3,4-Tetrahydro-1-methyl-β-carboline-3-carboxylic acid exhibited the highest binding affinities. ADMET analysis confirmed favourable profiles for these phytochemicals. The study suggests that these compounds present in EAF could be promising candidates for developing novel AD therapies."

This study aims to evaluate the antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic effects of Trigonella foenum-graecum L and Coffea arabica L seeds in STZ (streptozotocin) induced diabetic mice: impact on kidney and liver functions. METHODS: twenty-six male mice aged 2 weeks, were divided into five groups: normal control, diabetic control (DC), positive control (PC), galactomannan-treated (GM), and chlorogenic acid-treated (CGA). Trigonella foenum-graecum L (TFL) seeds were bought from the local market. Similarly, Coffea arabica L (CAL) seeds were collected from the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange. After a 28-day treatment period TFL and CAL, Fasting Blood Glucose diabetic control (FBG], Oral Glucose Tolerance (OGT), lipid profile, and kidney and liver function tests were conducted. Statistical analysis was performed using R software, with the significance level set at a P-value < 0.05. RESULTS: galactomannan-treated and CGA significantly reduced FBG by -176.8 and -252.4 (p<0.01), respectively, and improved OGT (AUC of CGA-7449 and GM-14754) in comparison to DC (52452] (p<0.05). Similarly, liver and kidney function tests showed a statistically significant difference against the non-treated group 1 (p<0.01). In the lipid profile test, galactomannan reduced triglyceride and cholesterol levels, while chlorogenic acid improved low-density lipoprotein and cholesterol. CONCLUSION: according to this research, TFL and CAL seeds decreased fasting blood glucose levels and improved glucose tolerance, lipid profiles, liver and kidney function tests, and glucose tolerance.",

This study investigates the therapeutic potential of Luetzelburgia auriculata lectin (LAA), a plant-derived protein, in accelerating wound closure. Excisional wounds were created on the backs of mice, which were subsequently treated topically with LAA solutions at two concentrations (100 µg/mL and 200 µg/mL) or saline control. Wound healing was assessed through clinical observations, including wound area measurement and inflammatory score, as well as histopathological analysis and measurement of inflammatory cytokines. LAA significantly accelerated wound closure, reduced inflammation, and promoted tissue regeneration. Histological analysis revealed enhanced re-epithelialization, increased fibroblast proliferation, and improved collagen deposition in LAA-treated wounds compared with the control group. Furthermore, LAA treatment significantly reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in wound tissues (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1). These findings suggest that LAA exerts its beneficial effects through a multifaceted mechanism, likely involving anti-inflammatory properties and stimulation of cellular processes crucial for tissue repair. This study provides preliminary evidence for the therapeutic potential of LAA in wound healing and warrants further investigation into its underlying mechanisms and clinical applications.",

This study aimed to assess the applicability of iBMV in a mixed cohort of breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM) patients treated with SRS/fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) and whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Considering disease dynamics, we analyzed the role of biological subtypes in determining the time interval between initial diagnosis and the occurrence of BM. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, single center cohort study of 126 BCBM patients who received radiotherapy to the brain (SRS/FSRT and WBRT) between 01/2013 and 12/2020. Statistical endpoints included iBMV, time interval between initial diagnosis and the occurrence of BM analyzed per biological subtype, and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Median iBMV was 0.48 BM/year. The iBMV independently predicted for mortality in the multivariate model after accounting for WBRT (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.41; p = 0.012). The biologic subtype significantly influenced the time interval between initial diagnosis of breast cancer and occurrence of BM. In a multivariate model, the Karnofsky performance status and HER2 status were strongest predictors of overall survival (HR = 2.60; 95% CI 1.60-4.22; p < 0.001 and HR = 2.26; 95% CI 1.34-3.84; p = 0.002, respectively). CONCLUSION: iBMV correlates with overall survival, regardless of whether WBRT was used as part of local treatment. The biological subtype has a profound impact on prognosis and kinetics of BCBM."

      "abstract": "The issue of water contamination has gotten worse worldwide due to industrialization and population increase. The wastewater discharge techniques used by Ethiopia's textile sector do not comply with the national discharge standard. Because the discharge of inadequately treated or untreated textile effluent into the environment is becoming more frequent. Thus, minimizing this trend's harm to the environment requires using the best wastewater treatment technology. Coagulation is considered one of the most effective methods for treating textile wastewaters, which technically need to have a natural or artificial coagulant added to eliminate dangerous pollutants. Nonetheless, criticism has been leveled against the use of chemical coagulants due to their serious disadvantages. This has led to an interest in substituting natural materials for chemical coagulants. The main objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of various powders and Moringa seed cactus pad powders when employed as a natural coagulant to clean up textile effluent. Moringa seeds and cactus pad consist of proteins (cationic and dimeric) which help in neutralizing and absorbing colloidal charges in water containing suspended solids. To examine the impacts of various operating parameters, including coagulant dose, pH, and mixing time, as well as the ideal coagulation conditions, experiments were conducted using a jar testing system. The ideal parameters were pH 4, 5 g/l of coagulant, 40 min of mixing time, 2 min of fast mixing at 100 rpm, 40 min of gradual mixing at 40 rpm, and 30 min of settling time. Under these ideal circumstances, 82.33 Moreover, cactus pad powder reduced turbidity by 53.16 %, TDS by 97 %, BOD by 58.75 %, COD by 25.37 %, Conductivity by 60 %, and TSS by 56.33 %. Therefore, using Cactus pad as a natural coagulant is advised. Rather than using Moringa seed, it efficiently eliminates turbidity, TDS, and TSS from wastewater effluents from the textile sector. Eventually, one of the natural coagulants employed in the coagulation process, Cactus pad, proved to be useful and was chosen."

This study aims to describe and analyse the differences and similarities between the four country-specific (Greece, Spain, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom) co-created interventions through a Makeathon by adolescents from the European Science Engagement to Empower aDolescentS (SEEDS) project, to tackle unhealthy behaviours. Also, it aims to determine if the barriers/facilitators identified in previous focus groups were addressed in the interventions. METHODS: This comparative design study describes and analyses the differences and similarities among the four co-created interventions from the SEEDS project, which is a cluster-randomised controlled trial using a citizen science approach that actively involves participants in all steps of the scientific process. Two of the relevant steps are the definition of the barriers and facilitators by focus groups and the co-design of the interventions by Makeathons. The interventions co-created in each country related to healthy snacking and physical activity (PA) practice are described using the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) with some extra information about the country context (barriers and facilitators). RESULTS: The four interventions have some points in common: type of activities per behaviour (methodology used), face-to-face activities, school hours implementation, and external professionals, teachers, or researchers as providers. However, the difficulties in comparing the interventions are the high diversity of activities and activity frequency among the four countries. About barriers, 2 of 3 modifiable barriers to healthy snacking behaviour and 4 of 6 modifiable barriers to PA and sedentary behaviour were addressed in the intervention, but 6 of 12 barriers to PA seemed not feasible for schools and not address in the intervention. Regarding facilitators, focusing on PA and sedentary behaviour, two of the four facilitators identified and focused on healthy snacking behaviour, and only one of the four facilitators identified was addressed in the interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In four co-created interventions by adolescent ambassadors, most of the barriers identified were addressed whereas the facilitators were not enough addressed. Thus, more effort is needed to completely adapt the intervention to the real interest of adolescents. Future research needs to confirm the SEEDS intervention effect and impact on the desired behaviour. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Num. NCT05002049; Date: 2021-08-12.",

This study explores the biopriming potential of Cucumis sativus L. seeds using extracts derived from a consortium of nitrofixing cyanobacteria Nostoc commune, Calothrix sp., and Aphanothece minutissima subjected to static magnetic field (SMF) treatments. The cyanobacterial consortia were exposed to SMF at varying magnetic inductions (40-50 mT and 100-200 mT), followed by extract preparation and application as biopriming agents. Results demonstrated significant improvements in key seedling growth parameters, including root and stem length, vigor index I, and fresh biomass. The consortium treated with 40-50 mT SMF showed the most pronounced growth-stimulating activity, suggesting enhanced bioactive compound production under this treatment that might be related to auxin biosynthesis. Biopriming with cyanobacterial extracts maintained a balanced nutritional uptake and plant health, as indicated by stable fresh weight dry weight ratios. These findings highlight the potential of SMF-enhanced cyanobacterial consortia as biopriming agents for horticultural crops. Future research should elucidate the underlying modes of action and optimize conditions for broader crop applications."

This study investigated the efficacy of calcium hypochlorite and peroxyacetic acid treatments in inactivating the cells of four enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) isolates-viz. E. coli O157:H7 K4492, F4546, and H1730, as well as E. coli O104:H4 BAA-2326-on alfalfa seeds and sprouts. The 2-3 log CFU/g of EHEC cells inoculated to sprout seeds became undetectable (≤1.40 log CFU/g) after treatment with the two sanitizers, even with the enrichment steps. Sprouts grown from calcium hypochlorite- and peroxyacetic acid-treated seeds had mean EHEC populations that were 4.54-4.60 log CFU/g and 1.25-1.52 log CFU/g lower, respectively, compared to those on sprouts grown from the untreated control seeds. Significantly (p ≤ 0.05) different from one another, the mean populations of the four EHEC isolates on harvested sprout samples were in the descending order of E. coli O157:H7 K4492, F4546, H1730, and E. coli O104:H4 BAA-2326. The results suggest that both sanitizing treatments effectively suppressed EHEC growth on alfalfa seeds and sprouts, but their effectiveness was bacterial-isolate-dependent."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The increased frequency of extreme weather events related to climate change, including the occurrence of extreme temperatures, severely affects crop yields, impairing global food security. Heat stress resulting from temperatures above 30 °C is associated with poor germination performance and stand establishment. The combination of climate-resilient crop genotypes and tailored seed priming treatments might represent a reliable strategy to overcome such drawbacks. This work explores the potential of hydropriming as a tool to mitigate the heat-stress-mediated impact on germination performance in orphan legumes. METHODS: For each tested species (Lathyrus sativus L., Pisum sativum var. arvense and Trigonella foenum-graecum L.), two accessions were investigated. Germination tests were performed at 25 °C, 30 °C, 35 °C and 40 °C to assess the heat stress tolerance threshold. Hydropriming was then applied and germination tests were performed at 40 °C to test the impact of the treatment on the seeds' ability to cope with heat stress. An alkaline comet assay and Quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction were performed on embryos excised from primed and control seeds. RESULTS: Phenotyping at the germination and seedling development stage highlighted the accession-specific beneficial impact of hydropriming under heat stress conditions. In L. sativus seeds, the alkaline comet assay revealed the dynamics of heat stress-induced DNA damage accumulation, as well as the repair patterns promoted by hydropriming. The expression patterns of genes involved in DNA repair and antioxidant response were consistently responsive to the hydropriming and heat wave conditions in L. sativus accessions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gastroparesis, a chronic digestive disorder characterized by delayed gastric emptying, often results from diabetes, post-surgical complications, autoimmune diseases, and neurological disorders. In approximately 50% of cases, the cause is idiopathic gastroparesis (IGD). Recent studies suggest a link between chronic enteroviral infection and persistent gastrointestinal symptoms, including delayed gastric emptying. This study investigates the effects of a silydianin-rich extract from Silybum marianum seeds on enteroviral infections in vitro and the mitigation of delayed gastric emptying in mice. Silydianin, a key bioactive compound known for its liver-protective and antioxidant properties, has not been extensively studied for its impact on enteroviral infections and gastroparesis. METHODS: NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C, DEPT 135 and 2D, and HSQC) and HRMS identified silydianin as the primary compound, with minor flavonolignans. This study assessed the cytotoxicity and antiviral activity of the extract at various stages of the viral life cycle, including virucidal activity, cell protection, and post-infection effects, using neutral red assays in RD cells, with results confirmed by real-time PCR. The viruses studied included coxsackievirus B2, coxsackievirus A10, poliovirus SL-1, and enterovirus EV71. The impact on delayed gastric emptying was evaluated in a mouse model using doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg compared to a control group receiving physiological saline. RESULTS: The silydianin-rich extract showed consistent antiviral activity, with the highest selectivity index (SI) for EV71 (4.08) during virucidal activity. It provided moderate cell protection, with EC50 values ranging from 120.88 to 186.10 µg/mL and SI values from 2.20 to 3.39. Post-infection treatment showed varying efficacy, with coxsackie A10 demonstrating the highest SI (3.90). In vivo, the extract at 200 mg/kg significantly improved gastric emptying to 96.47% and slightly increased gastrointestinal transit from 50.33% to 61.46%. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that silydianin may be effective for treating enteroviral infections and enhancing intestinal function, making it a promising candidate for gastroparesis treatment and warranting further research."

Due to their higher costs, potential side effects and drug interactions, and associated risks, some patients with HCV and HBV infections may not be able to afford conventional antiviral medications. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this review paper is to highlight the advantages of Nigella sativa, or black seeds, in the treatment of patients with HCV and HBV infections. METHODS: Medline/Pubmed/PMC, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Science Di-rect, Ebsco, Embase, and reference lists were searched to locate the research studies that assessed the effects of different black seed (N. sativa) preparations on the telltale signs and symptoms of HCV and HBV infections. RESULTS: Numerous preclinical and clinical investigations have suggested that black seeds (N. sativa) may be effective against HCV and HBV infections. Furthermore, N. sativa, or black seeds, have demonstrated a range of pleiotropic effects, such as antiviral activity against multiple other viruses and anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory properties that can lessen the symptoms and indicators of HCV and HBV infections. CONCLUSION: Patients with HCV and HBV infections may benefit from using black seeds (N. sativa) as an adjuvant therapy in addition to conventional therapy. Additional random-ized controlled clinical trials would confirm the safety and effectiveness of Nigella sativa (black seeds) in treating HCV and HBV infections."

Foraging birds may unintentionally take up soil-borne microplastics along with soil adhering to crop residues and seeds of cultivated species. Microplastic uptake by foraging terrestrial bird species, including Pica pica (magpie), Corvus cornix (hooded crow), and Columba palumbus (common wood pigeon), studied using camera traps, showed that the risk of MP uptake by these birds microplastics from compostable plastic bags was elevated by 27 and 78% when the microplastic particles were associated with corn seed grits or corn seeds, respectively. When these film fragments were coated with a slurry containing tannic acid, saponin, and juglone, microplastic uptake was significantly reduced. Similarly, coating corn seeds with this repellent slurry reduced seed predation by birds up to 86%, and completely wrapping corn seeds with a repellent plastic film resulted in no observed seed predation by birds. The same results were obtained when the wrapping film was replaced by a seed coating containing hairy cotton fibers which may have triggered a feather fear or repulsion response in the birds. This study demonstrated that covering corn seeds with natural repellents or hairy filaments provided complete protection from bird predation.",

Although bezoars with various seeds have been documented, those containing Akebia trifoliata seeds are rare. A case report describes a patient who developed lower gastrointestinal obstruction following consumption of Akebia trifoliata seeds. The patient was admitted to the hospital due to recurring abdominal pain and difficulty passing stool for 4 days. The Computed Tomography Scan revealed an intestinal obstruction in the lower gastrointestinal tract, which was later confirmed through colonoscopy and patient history as being caused by ingestion of Akebia trifoliata seeds. After receiving treatment, the intestinal tract recovered; however, multiple ulcers persisted."

      "abstract": "Colchicine (CHC), a poisonous plant alkaloid, has been widely utilized for decades in the treatment of gout, but has a rather low therapeutic index, which causes oxidative stress leading to cognitive impairment, brain damage, apoptosis, and hitopathological alterations in humans and experimental animals. The present investigation evaluated the potential palliative effect of the pumpkin seeds oil (PSO) at a dose of 4 ml/kg b.wt against CHC (0.6 mg/kg b.wt) -induced neurotoxic and neurobehavioral effects in rats. Forty male rats weighing 245-260 g were assigned to four groups. The results displayed that CHC exposure induced neurobehavioral disorders and a remarkable decline in the serotonin and dopamine levels and the immunoexpression of BDNF and GFAP in the brain. Besides, CHC treatment evoked brain oxidative stress, as manifested by depleted antioxidant enzyme activities and elevated malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PC) levels. Also, CHC triggered brain DNA damage, as indicated by a marked increment in the brain 8-Hydroxyguanosine (8-OHdG) level. However, concurrent treatment with the PSO effectively attenuated the CHC-induced toxic effects as evidenced by a noticeable increase in the serotonin (33 ± 3.05) and dopamine (2.48 ± 0.40) concentrations, and the BDNF and GFAP immunoexpression in the brain. Moreover, PSO mitigated CHC-induced brain oxidative stress and DNA damage as shown by elevated antioxidant enzyme activities (164 ± 3.46 SOD and 7.55 ± 0.43 CAT) and reduced MDA (1.62 ± 0.23), PC (1.35 ± 0.23), and 8-OHdG (3.02 ± 0.33) levels. These results concluded that PSO could serve as a therapeutic strategy to ameliorate the neurotoxic and neurobehavioral impacts of CHC.",

      "abstract": "Plant polyphenols have recently emerged as green nanoparticle (NP) precursors by oxidation-triggered assembly using oxidizing agents or in alkaline media. This study explored the potential of polyphenolic extracts derived from grape seed waste to serve as natural nanocarriers. Phenolic fractions were extracted from defatted grape seed waste, freeze-dried into powder, and characterized. Grape seed extracts (GSEs) of Obeidi and Asswad Karech, Lebanese autochthonous white and red grape varieties, respectively, had total phenolic contents (TPC) of 370 and 311 mg of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per gram of dry matter, respectively, along with a high content of catechins, gallic acid, epicatechins, caffeic acid, syringic acid, and protocatechuic acid. GSE NPs were obtained by the oxidation-triggered self-assembly of Obeidi and Asswad Karech polyphenols in the presence of sodium metaperiodate as the oxidizing agent. The NPs exhibited a spherical morphology, hydrodynamic diameters of 109 and 142 nm, and zeta potential values of -20 and -19 mV for Obeidi and Asswad Karech, respectively. Both types of NPs showed high colloidal and chemical stability, even after storage for three months at 4 °C. They also demonstrated high antioxidant capacity, excellent biocompatibility in human dermal fibroblasts, and promising intracellular radical scavenging activity in stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Furthermore, a gel formulation containing 2% Obeidi GSE NPs promoted wound healing with controlled infections and inflammation and faster tissue regeneration in a rat excision wound model. By day 19 of treatment, deep wounds treated with GSE NPs were fully healed with no visible scarring, while the untreated group showed deep scarring and discoloration. Our findings address the valorization of waste generated by wineries and present a promising natural nanocarrier with high stability, antioxidant properties, and anti-inflammatory activity.",

Understanding the dynamics and interactions between birds and drilled fields is crucial for developing sustainable farming practices that balance agricultural food production with wildlife conservation. This study focused on the attractivity of freshly drilled onion and carrot fields to birds and the potential exposure of birds to the pesticide-treated onion and carrot seeds available on the soil surface after drilling in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Bird surveys were conducted using scan sampling and point count methods to assess diversity and behavior before, on the day of drilling, and after drilling. Carrot fields showed a decrease in observed species and individuals on the day of drilling, with an increase in bird sightings after drilling. Similar trends were observed in onion fields, with the species composition changing after drilling and a significant decrease in abundance on the day of drilling. None of the species found foraging in the field after drilling were granivorous or omnivorous. Seed exposure was assessed by counting available seeds on the soil surface at different time points after drilling. Seed exposure was higher in the field border than in the field center. These findings indicate that carrot and onion fields offer limited food sources for granivore bird species probably due to low seed availability and intensive seedbed preparation. The research also suggests that freshly drilled carrot and onion crops are unattractive to foraging birds, with low seed exposure and a reduced likelihood of contact with pesticides applied as a seed treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of biliary metallic stent (BMS) combined with radioactive 125I seed strands (RISS) for malignant hilar obstruction (MHO). METHOD: From January 2016 to January 2022, 317 patients with MHO underwent percutaneous trans-hepatic biliary drainage at our center. Among them, 40 patients underwent BMS combined with RISS treatment (experimental group), and 52 patients underwent BMS alone (control group). Primary endpoints were technical success, complications and stent patency time (SPT). Secondary endpoints were clinical success and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The technical success (100% vs. 100%) and clinical success rate (92.50% vs. 90.04%) showed no statistically significance between the experimental and control groups (P > 0.05). The Grade 3-5 early and late complications showed no significance between both groups (P > 0.05). The SPT [(8.2 ± 0.39) vs. (5.8 ± 0.33) months] and OS [(13.6 ± 0.81) vs. (11.7 ± 0.44) months)] of the experimental group showed significantly longer than that of the control group ((P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed higher Bismuth type as an independent predictor for shorter OS (HR: 1.846, 95% CI: 1.019-3.341, P = 0.043) and SPT (HR: 1.959, 95% CI: 1.269-4.420, P = 0.009). CONCLUSION: Biliary metallic stent (BMS) placement combined with radioactive iodine-125 seed strands (RISS) is a safe and effective treatment option for patients with malignant hilar obstruction (MHO). However, multicenter randomized controlled trials are required to further validate the effectiveness and long-term benefits of this therapeutic approach.",

Results revealed that polyphenols in safflower seeds were predominantly present in free forms (89.51 %), followed by insoluble- (6.19 %) and soluble-bound (4.30 %) forms. MW treatment resulted in a significant increase in the content of free-form phenolics and total phenolic content (TPC). In the untreated and MW-treated samples, 58 phenolics were identified, with45 polyphenols detected in both types of samples. After the MW treatment, N-(p-coumaroyl) serotonin content increased but N-feruloyl serotonin content decreased in safflower seeds. MW treatment significantly increased the acacetin content, TPC, and oxidative stability of SSO. Additionally, the combined effect of MW treatment and SDE significantly improved polyphenol content in SSO, addressing the issue of poor oxidative stability that limits its applications.",

Enzymes play a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis in the metabolic processes that sustain life. Understanding what regulates enzyme activity is crucial for many scientific and industrial endeavors. The purpose of this research work was to examine how different chemical agents, and metallic salts affected the activity of two important food enzymes like α-amylase and protease in barley. These studies compared the effects of several chemical treatments applied to barley seeds, including urea, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), acetic acid, and a wide range of metallic salts. To determine the impact of each chemical on the stability of α-amylase and protease enzyme activity using standard assay procedures. The activities of α-amylase and protease were inhibited by increasing urea concentration, eventually eliminating them at 8 M urea. The enzymes lost their activities completely at 0.50 M EDTA. Treatment with higher acetic acid concentrations decreased their activities, but they retained 20.46 ± 1.06 % and 17.38 ± 1.09 % after treating with 20 % acetic acid. The application of CaCl2 led to a progressive increase for both the enzyme activities, but the maximum increases were observed 137.26 ± 1.42 % and 135.65 ± 1.17 % due to 0.50 M Ca2+. In the presence of Mn2+ and Mg2+ salts, enzyme activity increased notably. In contrast to K+ and Na+, which have negligible or no inhibitory effects but Zn2+, Cu2+, and Fe2+ considerably reduce the activity of both enzymes. According to the findings, the present research could be created with the scope of potentially identifying ways to maintain their activity for agricultural, industrial and also scientific applications."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The role of α-synuclein (α-syn) pathology in Parkinson's disease (PD) is well established; however, effective therapies remain elusive. Two mechanisms central to PD neurodegeneration are the intracellular aggregation of misfolded α-syn and the uptake of α-syn aggregates into neurons. Cationic arginine-rich peptides (CARPs) are an emerging class of molecule with multiple neuroprotective mechanisms of action, including protein stabilisation. This study characterised both intracellular α-syn aggregation and α-syn uptake in cortical neurons in vitro. Thereafter, this study examined the therapeutic potential of the neuroprotective CARP, R18D (18-mer of D-arginine), to prevent the aforementioned PD pathogenic processes through a cell-free thioflavin-T (ThT) assay and in cortical neurons. METHODS: To induce intracellular α-syn aggregation, rat primary cortical neurons were exposed to α-syn seed (0.14 μM) for 2 h to allow uptake of the protein, followed by R18D treatment (0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 μM), and a subsequent measurement of α-syn aggregates 48 h later using a homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay. To assess neuronal uptake, α-syn seeds were covalently labelled with an Alexa-Fluor 488 fluorescent tag, pre-incubated with R18D (0.125, 0.25, 0.5 μM), and then exposed to cortical neurons for 24 h and assessed via confocal microscopy. RESULTS: It was demonstrated that R18D significantly reduced both intracellular α-syn aggregation and α-syn seed uptake in neurons by 37.8% and 77.7%, respectively. Also, R18D reduced the aggregation of α-syn monomers in the cell-free assay. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of R18D to inhibit key α-syn pathological processes and PD progression."

      "abstract": "Salt stress inhibits rice seed germination. Strigolactone (GR24) plays a vital role in enhancing plant tolerance against salt stress. However, GR24's impact on the metabolism of stored substances and endogenous hormones remains unclear. This study investigated the impact of exogenous GR24 on the metabolism of stored substances and endogenous hormones during the early stages of rice seed germination under salt stress. The results showed that salt stress significantly reduced the germination rate, germination potential, germination index, radicle length, germ length, and fresh and dry weights of the radicle and germ under salt stress. Pre-treatment (1.2 μmol L-1 GR24) significantly reduced the inhibition of salt stress on rice seed germination and seedling growth. GR24 promoted the decomposition of starch by enhancing the activities of α-amylase, β-amylase, and total amylase and improved the levels of soluble sugars and proteins and the conversion rate of substances under salt stress. GR24 effectively enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX); increased ascorbic acid (ASA) and glutathione (GSH) levels; and reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) content. This reduced the oxidative damage of salt stress. Furthermore, GR24 significantly increased the contents of strigolactones (SLs), auxin (IAA), gibberellin (GA3), cytokinin (CTK) as well as IAA/ABA, CTK/ABA, GA/ABA, and SL/ABA ratios and reduced abscisic acid (ABA) levels. The current findings indicate that GR24 effectively mitigates the adverse impact salt stress by regulating antioxidant enzyme activity and endogenous hormone balance."

In this study, we compared the advantages and disadvantages of 3 types of purified hydrocolloid seed coatings from different waste sludges and one commercial seed coating at different spraying times (2, 4, 6, and 8). Compared with coated maize seeds, uncoated maize seeds underwent significant functional changes during the aging process according to the infrared spectroscopy results. Subsequent pot experiments were conducted at 4 days after aging. The average germination rate of the coated maize seeds was greater than that of the uncoated seeds at all spraying times. In terms of antioxidant enzyme activities, seeds treated with different coatings presented an increasing trend with increasing spraying time, indicating a difference between different spraying times. Principal component analysis revealed that the optimum number of sprays to achieve the results of carboxymethyl cellulose seed coating was 8 for the Xiaohongmen Wastewater Treatment Plant, 6 for the Dongba Wastewater Treatment Plant, and 4 for the Nanyang Wastewater Treatment Plant. The number of sprays applied in practice is an important determining factor during seed storage.",

Acanthopanax seeds are abundant in polysaccharides; however, whether Acanthopanax seed polysaccharides (ASP) improve AFLD through the gut-liver axis remains unclear. In this study, ASP was extracted using ultrasonic-assisted extraction, followed by structural characterization and monosaccharide composition analysis. The polysaccharide is primarily composed of pyranose rings, uronic acids, and hydroxyl groups, with galacturonic acid, galactose, and arabinose as its monosaccharide constituents. A gradient alcohol gavage was used to establish an AFLD mice model, and the protective effects of ASP dietary intervention were assessed. Results demonstrated that ASP intervention ameliorated the pathological state, liver damage, and oxidative stress in AFLD mice, while reducing alcohol-induced inflammation. Additionally, ASP intervention modified the gut microbiota of AFLD mice by reducing the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio, enhancing beneficial bacterial populations, suppressing harmful bacteria, and elevating short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels. These findings indicate that ASP ameliorates AFLD through gut-liver axis modulation, supporting the development of functional foods based on Acanthopanax seed polysaccharides for AFLD improvement.",

      "abstract": "Objective.The treatment of breast cancer during pregnancy requires careful consideration of consequences for both maternal and fetal health. In non-pregnant patients, the use of radioactive iodine-125 (125I)-seeds is standard practice for localising non-palpable breast tumors before breast-conserving surgery. However, the use of125I-seeds in pregnant patients has been avoided due to concerns about fetal radiation exposure.Approach.In this study a mathematical model was developed to estimate the fetal absorbed dose based on several factors: the radioactivity of the125I-seed, the duration of implantation, and the distance between the125I-seed and fetus as a function of maternal anatomy, gestational age, and fetal development. Three scenarios, representing a range of maternal and fetal anatomy, were evaluated, including a worst-case scenario from a radiation safety perspective.Main results.The results show that the fetal absorbed dose varies across the three scenarios, with ranges of 0.0-0.4 mGy, 0.0-1.0 mGy, and 0.0-1.6 mGy, depending on when the125I-seed was implanted and when it was removed. These dose ranges are similar to conventional diagnostic x-ray scans. The maximum calculated absorbed dose (1.6 mGy) is unlikely to be reached in practice and is well below the 100 mGy threshold associated with possible fetal malformations. The associated theoretical cancer risk increase (0.016%) is minimal.Significance.The use of125I-seeds as localisation method of breast tumors in pregnant patients results in low fetal radiation doses and should not be avoided due to dose concerns.",

Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a neurotropin that functions as a neuron protective. Nigella sativa L is reported to have an antioxidant effect, administration of Nigella Sativa L to rats treated with ischemia-reperfusion brain injury. Propofol is an anesthetic agent frequently used intravenously in the management of TBI. The effect of propofol on brain tissue after TBI may be neuroprotective. We aimed to compare the potential of Nigella sativa L and propofol as neuroplasticity and neuroprotection in rats with TBI. METHODS: This was a laboratory experimental animal model with the post-test only control group design, namely measuring the effect of treatment by comparing the five groups of rats consisting of 30 rats. BDNF levels in rat brain tissue were collected at day 7 of treatment and measured by ELISA. RESULTS: The average BDNF protein levels per group, namely G1 (221,243 pg/mL), G2 (172,139 pg/mL), G3 (255,483 pg/mL), G4 (227,089 pg/mL), and G5 (272,603 pg/mL) respectively. Based on the ANOVA statistic, p-value = 0.032 (there was a significant difference between groups), with the Levene Test (0.077) or having variance between the same groups, sequentially the difference in average BDNF protein levels of the five groups is G5>G3>G4>G1>G2, meaning that the combination of Nigella sativa and propofol has more potential to increase BDNF protein levels than Nigella sativa, and Nigella sativa has more potential than propofol. CONCLUSION: We concluded that both nigella sativa and propofol have the potential to increase BDNF protein levels. Nigella Sativa L had a better effect than propofol in repairing damaged neuron cells (neuroplasticity) and increasing BDNF protein levels (neuroprotection) for 7 days of administration in rat traumatic brain injury.",

Four diets were formulated with graded levels of CSO: 1.0%, 2.0%, and 3.0% represented as CSO (1), CSO (2), and, CSO (3) groups alongside a control group without CSO. L. rohita fingerlings (n = 180) (mean weight = 19.74 ± 0.33 g) were randomly distributed in triplicates for 60 days to these treatment groups. The results depicted significant improvements (p < 0.05) in weight gain (WG) %, specific growth rate (SGR), feed conversion ratio (FCR), and feed conversion efficiency (FCE) in the group supplemented with the lowest level of CSO. Gut microbial analysis evidenced the ability of CSO at 1.0% to augment the relative abundance of bacterial phyla such as Verrucomicrobiota, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidota, Fusobacteria and Firmicutes, as well as genera Luteolibacter and Cetobacterium, indicating higher alpha diversity compared to the control. Principle coordinate analysis (PCoA) demonstrated a distinct composition of microbial communities in CSO-supplemented groups relative to the control (p < 0.001). Correlation analysis further revealed a significant (p < 0.05) association of specific microbial taxa with growth performance parameters. The predictions of metabolic pathways suggested the involvement of carbohydrate and amino acid metabolic pathways in the CSO (1) group, indicating improved nutrient transport and metabolism. Overall, the findings highlight the beneficial effects of 1.0% CSO supplementation on growth performance and modulation of gut microbiota in L. rohita fingerlings.",

The effects of this strain on the seed germination vigor, bud growth and physiological characteristics of Chinese cabbage were analyzed by a seed coating method. The results showed the following: (1) The coating agent M. marquandii SGSF043 could significantly improve the germination activity of Chinese cabbage seeds. (2) The strain concentration in the seed coating agent had different degrees of regulation on the antioxidase system of the buds, indicating that it could activate the antioxidant system and improve the antioxidant ability of the buds. (3) When the concentration of M. marquandii SGSF043 was 5.6 × 106 CFU/mL (average per grain), the effect of M. marquandii SGSF043 on the leaf hormones Indole Acetic Acid (IAA), Gibberellic Acid (GA) and Abscisic Acid (ABA) of Chinese cabbage seedlings was significantly higher than that of other treatment groups, indicating that the strain could optimize the level of plant hormones. (4) M. marquandii SGSF043 could induce the expression of stress-resistance-related genes in different tissue parts of Chinese cabbage and improve the growth-promoting stress resistance of buds. This study showed that M. marquandii SGSF043 could not only improve the germination vitality of Chinese cabbage seeds but also enhance the immunity of young buds. The results provide a theoretical basis for the application potential of Metarhizium marquandii in agricultural production."

The photocatalytic efficiency of AgNPs, synthesized under varying concentrations of silver nitrate (AgNO3) and pH levels, was evaluated, together with the effectiveness of a photocatalytic reactor. The synthesized samples were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Results showed that MB degradation occurred quickly within the first 50 min, achieving a 99.60% removal efficiency via adsorption and photocatalytic degradation under optimal conditions (pH = 3, 1 g sample) after 1 h. The maximum adsorption capacity reached 49.80 mg·g-1. Furthermore, the AgNPs demonstrated a significant degradation rate of 99.76% within 2 h under UV light, highlighting the synergistic effects of AgNPs in enhancing both adsorption and photocatalysis.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD), a neurodegenerative autosomal dominant disorder, is characterized by involuntary choreatic movements with cognitive and behavioral disturbances. Up to now, no therapeutic strategies are available to completely ameliorate the progression of HD. Schisandra chinensis has various pharmacologic effects such as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the neuroprotective value of seed oil of S. chinensis (SOSC) has not been elucidated yet. The purpose of this study was to determine neuroprotective effects of SOSC by supercritical fluid extraction against 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA)-induced HD-like symptoms and neuropathology in an experimental mouse model. METHODS: SOSC (75, 150, and 300 mg/kg/day) was orally pre-administration once daily at 1 hour before 3-NPA intoxication. RESULTS: SOSC ameliorated movement dysfunction and lethality following 3-NPA intoxication in connection with reduction of lesion area, neurodegeneration/apoptosis, microglial migration/activation, and mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines/enzymes in the striatum. SOSC inhibited the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs) pathways but stimulated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in the striatum after 3-NPA intoxication. Schizandrin, a main component of SOSC, reduced protein expression levels of Iba-1 and p-NF-κB in 3-NPA-induced BV2 cells (murine microglia cell line). BV2 cell's conditioned medium inhibited cleaved caspase-3 in 3-NPA-induced SH-SY5Y cells (a neuroblastoma cell line). CONCLUSION: SOSC might ameliorate movement dysfunction by inhibiting neuropathology through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities in the striata of 3-NPA-intoxicated mice. These findings suggest that SOSC could serve as a promising therapeutic candidate for HD-like symptoms, providing a foundation for future treatment strategies targeting neuroinflammation and oxidative stress."

Total phenolic and flavonoid quantities of the grape seeds roasted in microwave (MW) and conventional oven (CO) systems were recorded between 673.57 (control) and 713.57 (MW) to 7121.67 (MW) and 7791.67 mg/100 g (CO), respectively. Antioxidant activities of the grape seeds varied between 6.57 (MW) and 7.24 mmol/kg (control). Catechin and rutin quantities of the grape seeds were recorded to be between 435.30 (CO) and 581.57 (control) to 94.94 (CO) and 110.53 mg/100 g (MW), respectively. While gallic acid amounts of the seed samples are established between 21.06 (control) and 101.79 (MW), quercetin values of the grape seeds were assigned to be between 56.59 (control) and 77.81 mg/100 g (CO). In addition, p-coumaric acid and resveratrol quantities of the grape seeds were recorded between 15.43 (control) and 22.98 (CO) to 12.50 (CO) and 29.57 mg/100 g (MW), respectively. The main fatty acids in oil samples were linoleic, oleic, palmitic and stearic acids in decreasing order. Linoleic and oleic acid values of the oils provided from grape seeds were recorded to be between 72.75 (control) and 73.33% (MW) to 14.79 (CO) and 14.87% (MW), respectively. It was observed that the element results related to the grape seed differed based on the roasting type when compared to the control. The most abundant elements in the grape seed were K, P, Mg, S, Na, Fe, Ca, Zn, and K and P amounts of the grape seeds were reported to be between 6706.93 (MW) and 7089.33 (control) to 2764.27 (CO) and 2927.97 mg/kg (control), respectively.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Litchi chinensis (Sonn.), belonging to the Sapindaceae family, has historically been used for the treatment of gastrointestinal ailments, including ulcers, gastritis, diarrhea, and infections. Plants in the Sapindaceae family have demonstrated potential anthelmintic effects, while the efficacy of L. chinensis remains barely investigated. L. chinensis seeds are often discarded as waste; however, utilizing these seeds promotes sustainable practices and may provide a natural alternative to conventional anthelmintics. The study aims to investigate the qualitative phytochemicals and evaluate the anthelmintic efficacy of L. chinensis seed ethanolic extract (LCSE). METHODS: Fresh L. chinensis fruits were collected from a local market, peeled fruits and removed aril from the seeds and then washed, air-dried and extracted with ethanol. A qualitative phytochemical screening and assessment of the anthelmintic properties of LCSE were conducted using standard procedures. The time required for paralysis and death of adult earthworms (Eisenia fetida) was assessed by analyzing each test solution at five distinct dosages (5, 25, 50, 75, and 100 mg/mL). Albendazole served as the standard, while distilled water functioned as the control. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test in GraphPad Prism version 10.1.2. RESULTS: Qualitative analysis revealed that LCSE is rich in phytochemicals, including alkaloids, anthraquinones, carbohydrates, flavonoid, glycosides, proteins and amino acids, phenols, terpenoids, and tannins. The anthelmintic activities of the LCSE and albendazole were dose-dependent, as the time required for paralysis and mortality decreased in proportion to the concentrations increased. LCSE exhibited strong anthelmintic efficacy at a concentration of 100 mg/mL (paralysis 12.67 ± 0.33, death 14 ± 0.58), which was significantly greater than that of albendazole (paralysis 15 ± 1.15, death 17.67 ± 1.15). CONCLUSION: This finding suggests that LCSE holds potent anthelmintic properties, making it a promising natural alternative to conventional treatments like albendazole."

This study was conducted to investigate the antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic effects of the fenugreek seed extract on fructose-induced diabetic wistar rats. Indeed, 5 groups of rats were formed; the first and second groups were composed of normal rats treated with distilled water and fenugreek seed extract, respectively. The third, fourth, and fifth groups composed of diabetic rats were administered distilled water, 500 mg/kg of fenugreek seed extract, and 25 µg/kg. bw of a standard antidiabetic drug consecutively for 28 days. The repeated ingestion of fenugreek seed generated a significant rise (p < 0.05) of food and water consumption in diabetic rats as compared to the rats treated with distilled water. Furthermore, fenugreek seed extract caused a remarkable elevation of the body weights of diabetic rats in comparison with other groups. Additionally, chronic treatment of rats with fenugreek seed extract improved fasting blood sugar, total cholesterol and triglycerides levels in diabetic rats. Fenugreek seed extract has significant anti-diabetic activity by reducing the fasting blood sugar and ameliorating the lipid parameters of diabetic rats. However, more studies are required to isolate the phytochemical constituents that possess these activities and elucidate their mechanisms of action.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Brachytherapy (BT) is routinely used in the treatment of various cancers. Current BT relies on the placement of large sources of radioactivity at the tumor site, requiring applicators that may cause local traumas and lesions. Further, they suffer from inflexibility in where they can be placed and some sources reside permanently in the body, causing potential long-term discomfort. These issues can be circumvented through injectable sources, prepared as biodegradable materials containing radionuclides that form solid seeds after administration. The level of radioactivity contained in such seeds must be sufficient to achieve substantial local irradiation. In this report, we investigate two different strategies for biodegradable BT seeds. RESULTS: The first strategy entails injectable seeds based on 103Pd-labeled palladium-gold alloy nanoparticles ([103Pd]PdAuNPs). These were prepared by combining [103Pd]PdH2Cl4 and AuHCl4, followed by lipophilic surface coating and dispersed in lactose octaisobutyrate and ethanol (LOIB:EtOH), in overall radiochemical yield (RCY) of 83%. With the second strategy, [103Pd]Pd-SSIB was prepared by conjugating the [16]aneS4 chelator with lipophilic sucrose septaisobutyrate (SSIB) followed by complexation with [103Pd]PdH2Cl4 (RCY = 99%) and mixed with LOIB:EtOH. [103Pd]Pd-SSIB was likewise formulated as injectable liquid forming seeds by mixing with LOIB. Both formulations reached activities of 1.0-1.5 GBq/mL and negligible release of radioactivity after injection of 100 µL (100-150 MBq) into aqueous buffer or mouse serum of less than 1% over one month. CONCLUSION: Both strategies for forming injectable BT seeds containing high 103Pd activity resulted in high radiolabeling yields, high activity per seed, and high activity retention. We consider both strategies suitable for BT, with the preferable strategy using a [16]aneS4 chelator due to its higher biodegradability."

The rise of new strains resistant to traditional antibiotics has exacerbated the problem. Thus, the search for new antimicrobial molecules remains highly relevant. METHODS: The current study purified, characterized, and assessed the antimicrobial activity of a papain inhibitor from Terminalia catappa L. seeds. RESULTS: The inhibitor was purified by heating the crude extract at 80°C for 30 min, followed by ion exchange chromatography on a DEAE cellulose column. The purification index was 9-fold, yielding 2.3%. SDS-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography revealed that the protease inhibitor (TcPI) is a 15.9 kDa monomeric protein. The inhibition kinetics showed that TcPI is a competitive inhibitor specific to papain (Ki = 1.02 x 10-4 M). TcPI remained active even after heating at 100 ºC for 120 min and at pH conditions varying from 2.0 to 10.0. Even after 60 min, TcPI was resistant to papain proteolysis. TcPI exhibited antimicrobial activity against Candida parapsilosis and Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSION: Here, we show that TcPI is a highly stable type-1 cystatin with the potential to combat infections caused by C. parapsilosis and S. aureus. Additional investigations into TcPI's structural aspects and mechanism of action, as well as safety assessments, are essential prerequisites for its potential application as a novel therapeutic intervention."

Eighteen out of twenty-two target pesticide residues were detected at concentrations ranging up to 344 µg/L. Results revealed varying detection frequencies and concentrations of pesticides, with clothianidin (98.6 %), thiamethoxam (97.2 %), and the degradation product imidacloprid desnitro (95.3 %) among the most frequently detected compounds. Spatial distributions indicate higher levels pesticide concentrations occurred in an intermittent waterway downstream from a wastewater spill occurring at the facility prior to monitoring. The risk quotient analysis shows that except for the most upstream (nonpoint source) location, at least one sample from each site posed elevated exposure risk for three different trophic levels (Algae, Daphnia magna and Fathead Minnow). Acute and chronic aquatic toxicity benchmarks set by US EPA for aquatic invertebrates were exceeded due to elevated concentrations of imidacloprid, clothianidin and thiamethoxam in both waterways. Few, if any studies have documented the occurrence of neonicotinoid degradation products at these concentrations in aquatic environments, and concentrations of desnitro imidacloprid at up to 85 µg/L are particularly concerning, given its reported toxicity. Findings from the study highlight the risks of using pesticide-treated seed as a feedstock for ethanol production.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Displacement minimization of seeds is crucial during surgery in brachytherapy; however, only a few reports have compared the operability of different seeds. TheraStrand-SL is a seed, in which TheraAGX100 is wrapped in polyglactin 910 thread, and intra-prostatic displacement is expected to be reduced compared with that of Thera-AGX100, owing to the complex shape of TheraStrand-SL. We conducted a prospective study on the operability and treatment outcomes of TheraAGX100 and TheraStrand-SL placement by a single operator. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 69 patients who received brachytherapy for prostate cancer. Endpoints were comparisons of intra- and post-treatment dose-volume histograms, seed displacement incidence rate, seed displacement distance, seed migration/dropout incidence rate, and adverse events incidence rate between TheraAGX100 (n = 25) and TheraStrand-SL (n = 44) groups. RESULTS: The intra-prostatic displacement incidence rate was significantly lower in the TheraStrand-SL group than in the TheraAGX100 group (TheraAGX100 group: 96.0%; TheraStrand-SL group: 11.4%). Further, the intra-prostatic displacement count per case tended to be lower in the TheraStrand-SL group than in the TheraAGX100 group. Additionally, a comparison of displacement distance per case showed that the TheraStrand-SL group (2.01 mm) had a statistically significantly shorter distance than the TheraAGX100 group (9.22 mm). No significant differences between the two groups were observed in terms of migration, explanted dropout seed count, dose-volume histograms, and adverse events incidence rate. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated the usefulness of TheraStrand-SL against intra-prostatic displacement. We expect TheraStrand-SL to have further applications in brachytherapy, including focal therapy."

      "abstract": "AIMS/BACKGROUND: Obesity is characterized by excessive body fat and is a chronic and complex disease. The medications used to date for the treatment of obesity have exhibited various side effects. Thus, new substances must be sought from alternative sources as anti-obesity drugs. Recently, there has been increased interest in the study of bioactive peptides generated from plant proteins for functional food development. Plant proteins have exhibited pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity and can be potentially studied as sources of anti-obesity drugs for long-term use. Amaranthus cruentus seeds are very nutritious, with high protein con-tent and medicinal properties. Hence, this study focuses on pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity and functional properties of Amaranthus cruentus seed protein isolates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Proteins were isolated using conventional and thermal isoelectric pre-cipitation methods. The protein's ability to inhibit lipases was assessed using both synthetic and natural substrates. The functional properties, such as nitrogen solubility, foaming test, emulsi-fication test, and water and oil holding abilities, were evaluated. The protein isolates were char-acterized by SDS-PAGE and DSC. Cell line studies were performed on 3T3-L1 cell lines to determine the cytotoxicity and anti-adipogenic activity of protein isolates. RESULTS: Proteins 1, 2, 3, and 4 were found to have high protein yield and protein content. SDS-PAGE characterization showed protein bands at different molecular weights (kDa). Protein iso-lates demonstrated good functional properties and antilipase activity as compared to flour. In the cell line experiments, protein 1 exhibited a dose-dependent reduction in the lipid content. CONCLUSION: A. cruentus seed protein could pave the way for the development of nutraceutical formulation in the treatment of obesity."

      "abstract": "Diabetes Mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels, causing significant morbidity and mortality rates. This study investigated the antidiabetic, neuroprotective, and antioxidant effects of ethanol extracts of Parkia biglobosa (PB) leaves and seeds in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. The administration of STZ significantly elevated fasting blood glucose levels (FBGL) to 355-400 mg/mL compared to 111 mg/mL in normal controls, indicating hyperglycemia. Treatment with PB extracts at 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg significantly (p < 0.05) reduced FBGL in a dose-dependent manner. No significant difference was observed between the effects of metformin and PB extracts at 200 mg/kg. Cognitive dysfunction, assessed using the Y-maze test, was significantly improved in groups treated with PB extracts (p < 0.05), particularly at 200 mg/kg, through inhibition of cholinesterase activity and protection against oxidative damage. Both PB extracts also demonstrated significant inhibition (p < 0.05) of α-amylase and α-glucosidase activity, reducing postprandial hyperglycemia, with a stronger inhibition at 200 mg/kg. Additionally, PB extracts significantly increased catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, reversing the diabetes-induced decline in antioxidant enzyme levels. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity, elevated in diabetic conditions, was significantly downregulated by PB treatment, further contributing to neuroprotection. The neuroprotective effects may be attributed to the inhibition of cholinesterase and MAO, which help maintain neurotransmitter levels, alongside the antioxidant properties that mitigate oxidative stress in the brain. These findings suggest that PB extracts could serve as a natural therapeutic agent for diabetes management, with its effects comparable to metformin at higher doses.",

      "abstract": "Apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) seeds exhibit deep embryonic dormancy. Uniform germination of isolated apple embryos is observed after 40-day-long cold stratification of the seeds. Stratification treatment modifies the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are regarded as key regulators of seed dormancy. In this study, axes of embryos isolated from seeds stratified for 7, 14, 21, and 40 days differing in dormancy depth were used. After one week of stratification, the increased polyamine oxidase activity enables ROS generation, which is followed by an upregulation of the NADPH oxidase gene expression. Catalase activity increased after 14 days of stratification, suggesting the requirement to maintain ROS concentrations at an optimal level already in the early phase of dormancy removal. When cold stratification was prolonged, accompanied by a significant increase in ROS level, ROS scavenging by catalase was supported by elevated phenolic compounds content. Then, peroxidase activity was also the highest. As ROS-induced phenylalanine (Phe) oxidation leads to the formation of meta-tyrosine (m-Tyr) - a potentially toxic component, the levels of these amino acids were examined. The fluctuation in m-Tyr content indicates the existence of mechanisms in the tissue for the disposal of this compound. Finally, its presence may be mitigated by an increase in Phe levels. Maintaining oxidised RNA at elevated levels from the 14th day of stratification may be crucial for seed dormancy removal, ensuring translation regulation as metabolism resumes. We concluded that dormancy removal of apple seeds by stratification requires a time-dependent sequence of biochemical events reflecting ROS metabolism alterations.",

      "abstract": "Seed germination is a pivotal stage in the plant life cycle, with endosperm weakening and radicle elongation serving as crucial prerequisites for successful endospermic seed germination. Tilia henryana seeds exhibit deep dormancy, necessitating a period of 2-3 years to germinate in a natural environment, and the germination rate is extremely low. This study employed morphological and physiological approaches to dynamically analyzing the hydrological mechanism and the endosperm weakening process during the dormancy release of T. henryana seeds. It was found that there was no physiological post-ripening effect of embryos, but there were mechanical and physiological obstacles in endosperm. During the dormancy release process of T. henryana seeds, initial endosperm weakening occurred at the radicle-endosperm interface. In this process, the GA/ABA level is imbalanced along with a continuous decrease in IAA and SA levels. Substantial depletion of storage materials within cells resulted in degradation of endosperm cell contents, forming numerous cavities through which significant amounts of free water entered. As moisture content increased, endosperm hardness gradually decreased to approximately 5 N/0.09 cm2. Furthermore, the area and content of lignin and cellulose were reduced by 58.91% and 84.49%, respectively, while the hemicellulose and pectin contents were decreased by 72.11% and 83.50%, in that order. Following treatment, the activity of pectin lyase, propectinase, galacturonase, and cellulase was observed to be 5.81, 8.72, 5.96, and 9.43 times higher, respectively, in comparison to their respective activities before treatment. The physiological changes facilitated the rapid rupture of the endosperm cell wall, leading to a transition in cell morphology from palisade-like to irregular and interlocking, thereby further expediting the weakening and cleavage of the endosperm. Additionally, T. henryana seeds exhibited high carbohydrate composition content throughout their dormancy release process, this extensive utilization of storage substances provided energy for radicle elongation and expansion.",

This study aims to investigate the potential application of Cucurbitaceae leaves and seed extracts to prevent and treat colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS: Four extracts (ethanol extracts and protein extracts and hydrolysates) from the leaves and seeds of cucurbits were tested in T-84, HCT-15 and HT-29 CRC cells. The antitumor, antiangiogenic, antioxidant and chemopreventive potentials and bioactive composition of the active extracts were characterized. RESULTS: Cold ethanolic extracts from the leaves and seeds of two interspecific Cucurbita genera (CLU01002 and COK01001) exhibited potent antiproliferative, specific and non-hepatotoxic activity against CRC cell lines, with a slight synergistic effect in combination with oxaliplatin. This antitumor activity was related to G2/M cell cycle arrest, the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, cytokinesis inhibition and autophagy. The extracts also inhibited tumor clonogenicity and angiogenesis, and modulated cancer stem cell (CSC) gene expression, as well as expressing antioxidant and chemopreventive cellular capabilities. Finally, phenolic and cucurbitane-type triterpenoid compounds (pengxianencins and cucurbitacins) were tentatively identified in the active extracts by UPLC-MS analysis and bioguided fractionation. CONCLUSIONS: Extracts from leaves the and seeds of two interspecific Cucurbita genera (CLU01002 and COK01001) may contribute to the improvement of prevention and treatment strategies for CRC patients.",

The effects of spraying salicylic acid (SA) during the grain-filling stage on the salt tolerance of progeny seeds in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were investigated in this study. The results showed that spraying SA during the grain-filling stage significantly increased the grain weight and yield of wheat plants. Meanwhile, the seeds from the SA-treated plants showed a higher germination rate, length and dry mass of the coleoptile and radicle, and a lower mean germination time compared to the seeds of water-treated plants under the salt germination condition, indicating that SA pretreatment during the grain-filling stage could effectively improve the salt tolerance of progeny seeds in wheat. SA pretreatment significantly increased the activities of amylases and the respiration rate, accompanied by a decrease in starch content, and a higher accumulation in the level of soluble sugars and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the germinated seedlings compared to the water pretreatment under salt stress. In addition, SA pretreatment obviously alleviated the increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) content and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) release rate in seedlings by activating antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD)) under salt stress. Moreover, the seedlings of the SA-treated plants showed lower Na+ and higher K+ contents compared to the seeds of water-treated plants under salt stress. The results of this study indicate that spraying SA during the grain-filling stage improves the capacity of offspring seeds to maintain osmotic and ion balance and redox homeostasis under salt stress, thereby conferring salt tolerance to the wheat seeds."

The germination rate of plasma-treated seeds exceeded 90% within 18 h of seeding compared to 30 h for the control (without plasma treatment). Stem length increased by 25.42 to 52.88% depending on the pressure and exposure time compared to control. Vitamin C content in the stem and root increased from 1.49 to 1.97 and 1.27 to 2.04-fold higher, respectively, depending on the pressure and exposure time compared to control; while in the case of thiol content, it was 1.16 to 2.76 and 1.09 to 2.49-fold higher in the stem and root, respectively. Plasma treatment increased antioxidant potency compared to control. Maximum antioxidant potency was found at 30-min exposure time, although the alterations in pressure did not elicit prominent changes. Plant growth, vitamin C and thiol contents, and antioxidant potency were increased with increasing pressure up to 60 Pa, which then declined with higher pressure. On the other hand, these parameters decreased with a longer exposure time, except for the antioxidants. Thiol and vitamin C contents were associated with plant growth.",

      "abstract": "Wheat is a most important food crop worldwide. Wheat is reported to be susceptible to a variety of fungi, which could induce huge economic losses and the contamination of potential mycotoxins could bring serious toxic effects. In this work, UV-C irradiation treatment on Fusarium infected wheat seeds during germination was investigated. The results show that UV-C irradiation treatment could promote the germination rate of wheat in inoculated seeds samples. In addition, UV-C treatment could significantly inhibit Fumonisins and Beauvericin mycotoxins production. However, Enniatins production in inoculated wheat seed samples are enhanced in long-term UV-C irradiation treatment samples. Metabolites of Fumonisins, Beauvericin, and Enniatins are evaluated with major metabolic pathways including methylation/demethylation, hydrogenation/dehydrogenation, oxidation/deoxidation, and acetylation. In conclusion, short time UV treatment for 15 min is the best for the inhibition of target Fusarium mycotoxins production, which will be benefit for the improvement of the quality and safety of wheats.",

      "abstract": "In this study, innovative electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) were developed and characterized, demonstrating significant performance enhancements. Initially, NMC622@TiO2 was synthesized using a wet-chemical method with titanium(IV) ethoxide as the Ti source. Advanced structural investigations confirmed the successful formation of a core@shell structure with negligible cation mixing (Li+/Ni2+) at the NMC622 surface, contributing to enhanced electrochemical performance. Subsequently, carbon-based anode materials were produced from biomass, specifically fig seeds, and subjected to high-temperature heat treatment. The resulting powders exhibited dominant graphitic properties, evidenced by a Raman ID/IG ratio of 0.5. Electrochemical evaluations of both electrode materials were conducted using half-cell configurations. The optimization of the TiO2 coating process was assessed through half-cell performance metrics and diffusion rates calculated from galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) experiments. The final phase focused on full-cell design, employing a prelithiation strategy for anodes using a direct contact technique. Optimization of the prelithiation process led to the assembly of full cells combining NMC622/prelithiated fig-seed anodes and NMC622@TiO2/prelithiated fig-seed anodes. The results revealed that TiO2-coated NMC622, paired with prelithiated carbon anodes derived from fig seeds, delivered superior performance compared to uncoated NMC622 full cells. This study underscores the potential of biomass-derived carbon anodes and TiO2 coatings in enhancing the efficiency and performance of LIBs."

A detailed assessment of the seed's proximate composition, enzyme activity levels, and antinutrient content was performed. The seeds were then subjected to infrared, hot air, and blanching treatments to examine how these processing methods affect enzyme activities and antinutrients. In addition, optimization of processing conditions was carried out using the response surface method and central composite design to ensure low antinutrient levels, minimal color change, and total enzyme inactivation. Sainfoin seeds have a crude protein content of 42 % in dry matter, making them a promising alternative plant-based protein source. They also contain 45 % dietary fiber, 9 % crude fat, and significant levels of potassium and magnesium. The unprocessed seeds exhibited 2.01 U/g lipase activity and 10.51 U/g lipoxygenase activity, which were inactivated with infrared treatment at 2000 W IR power in 75 s. In terms of antinutrients, sainfoin seeds contain 247 mg/100 g phytic acid, 2582 TIU/g trypsin inhibitor activity, 7.9 mg catechin equivalents of tannin /100 g, and 24.97 mg/100 g hydrocyanic acid. The optimal process conditions were 2000 W IR power and 105 s for IR treatment, 150 °C and 103 min for hot air treatment, and 81 °C and 16 min for blanching. The antinutrient levels and enzyme activities in unprocessed sainfoin seeds are comparable to those found in conventional legumes, although sainfoin seeds contain a higher amount of tannins. While infrared treatment was most effective for enzyme inactivation, the impact of the different processing methods varied across the parameters studied.",

Various methods such as, conventional solvent extraction, green extraction methods like Soxhlet extraction, microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), maceration methods, ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) and supercritical fluid extraction methods are employed to extract diosgenin from fenugreek seeds. Fundamentals such as solvent choice, pre-treatment techniques, and optimization parameters, affect the diosgenin extraction process. Furthermore, the quantification of diosgenin is governed by analytical methods(chromatography and spectroscopy), underscoring the significance of standardizing diosgenin levels to set the stage for upcoming pharmacological research. However there have been very negligible resources which focuses on conventional and novel techniques for extraction of diosgenin from Fenugreek seeds.

      "abstract": "The study of the effects of magnetic seed treatment (MST) has garnered significant attention from scientists due to its positive results in seed germination and seedling establishment. Few studies have comprehensively evaluated developmental parameters during the plant's vegetative stage. This study aimed to analyze tomato plants developed from magnetically treated seeds during the vegetative stage in terms of i) physiological responses, ii) growth dynamics, iii) correlation between physiological variables, and iv) the contribution of the technique compared with the performance of a highly commercial cultivar. There were 225 experimental units and three experimental groups with 75 plants each. Treatment one (T1) included plants developed from magnetically treated low-cost seeds; control 1 (C1) included plants developed from the same low-cost seeds without magnetic treatment (MT), and a secondary control (C2) was included with plants developed from high-cost seeds without MT to contrast the effect of MT on a low-cost seed with the performance of a high-cost one. Each plant was measured twice a week for leaf area, stem diameter, height, number of leaves, and chlorophyll content. A longitudinal study, using a repeated-measures design over time, was complemented by a correlational cross-sectional study through principal component analysis. A longitudinal study showed that magnetic treatment continuously modified the structure and biomass accumulation of plants throughout the vegetative stage. Plant height, stem diameter, and leaf number were directly and independently correlated with time, whereas chlorophyll content and leaf area were time-dependent. The effect of MST persists and improves the physiological responses of tomato plants up to the vegetative development stage. MST changes the growth dynamics of T1 compared to C1. Lastly, the physiological performance of plants generated from magnetically treated low-cost seeds was superior to that of plants generated from seeds without MST, and it closely followed the trend of the highly commercial cultivar, C2. To ensure the viability of MST as a biotechnological tool applicable to agriculture, future work should include the analysis of the subsequent phenological stages of the plants and determination of crop yield."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The treatment of recurrent tracheal adenoid cystic carcinoma (TACC), a rare pulmonary malignant tumor, typically involves bronchoscopic interventional therapy for patients ineligible for surgery or external radiotherapy. This report describes an innovative treatment approach for TACC, initially managed with interventional bronchoscopy and subsequently with a Y-shaped airway stent loaded with 125I seeds, following recurrence after 2 years. CASE PRESENTATION: A 50-year-old man presented with intermittent coughing for 2 months and was admitted to the hospital after the discovery of TACC a month earlier. Preoperative bronchial artery embolization was performed to reduce the risk of bleeding, followed by bronchoscopic tumor resection in January 2017 using an electric loop at the base, complemented by argon plasma coagulation (APC) and cryotherapy. Although short-term outcomes were favorable, the long-term prognosis remained suboptimal. Due to tumor recurrence, airway tumor resection and implantation of the 125I seed stent were performed under bronchoscope guidance in early 2019. The stent was removed 5 months later. The patient tolerated the procedure well and exhibited no signs of relapse or progression during the 5-year postoperative follow-up period. This case illustrates the successful application of a stent loaded with 125I seeds for treating unresectable TACC. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of TACC with a covered airway stent loaded with 125I seeds may be a safe, effective, and scalable method."

We evaluated the chemopreventive potential of marolo seed almond flour (MSAF) and marolo seed film flour (MSFF) and correlated the results obtained with the antioxidant capacity presented by the seed. Total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) were determined by spectrophotometric analysis and phenolics profile composition by Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC). In addition, the in vitro antioxidant activity was determined by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS•+) expressed in trolox equivalent (TE) of MSFF (165 and 325 µmol TE/g) and MSAF (7.21 and 4.34 µmol TE/g), respectively. MSFF displayed of antioxidant activity values by DPPH (165.98 µmol TE/g) and ABTS•+ (323.13 µmol TE/g) and TPC, expressed in gallic acid equivalent (GAE), of 54.28 mg GAE/g with predominance of myricetin (368.17 µg/g), and TFC, expressed in catechin equivalent (CE), of 50.86 mg CE/g, representing ∼ 93 % of the TPC. MSAF presented TPC of 1.52 mg GAE/g, with TFC of 0.76 mg CE/g (∼50 % of TPC), with predominance of quercetin (29.08 µg/g). The chemopreventive activity against DNA damage induced by doxorubicin (DXR) [20 mg/kg body weight (bw)]) was evaluated in Swiss mice peripheral blood by micronucleus test. Toxicological parameters, such as food and water consumption and animal weight, as well as blood glucose levels, were monitored during 14 days of treatment. The results showed that MSFF and MSAF presented no significant cytotoxic and mutagenic effects. The MSFF at doses of 3.5, and 7.0 mg/day showed a chemopreventive effect, while in the doses of 14.0 and 28.0 mg/day, no effect was observed. On the other hand, in the MSAF, a chemopreventive effect was observed only in the dose of 28 mg/day. The interference of one or more of the bioactive compounds with antioxidant activity presents in the MSFF may explain the best protective effect against DNA damage. Therefore, both marolo seed flours (MSFF and MSAF) can be considered potential food ingredients products that could be applied in food or pharmaceutical preparations with antioxidant and chemopreventive properties.",

The present study aims to use garden cress seeds (GAC) as a natural antioxidant to mitigate these challenges and evaluate its effects on reproductive performance, immunity, hormones, protein profile and milk quality. A total of 24 pregnant V-Line rabbits (pregnant at 20 days proved by palpation), with an initial body weight of 2395.83 g and about 6-7 months of age, were randomly distributed to 4 groups, the control group was fed the basal diet without GAC, the other treated groups GAC 3, GAC 4.5 and GAC 6 were fed the basal diet supplemented with 3, 4.5, and 6% GAC, respectively. The experiment lasted six weeks. The results revealed that treated female rabbits with different levels of GAC did not have a noticeable effect on milk yield, average daily milk yield, or most of the milk analysis parameters (milk density, total solids, solids not fat, lactose, ash, and protein). On the other hand, GAC showed a significant increase in milk fat, and GAC 3% rabbits displayed a higher percentage of milk fat (p < 0.050) than the other groups. Likewise, treatment with GAC also had a significant impact on serum total protein, globulin, IgG, and IgM. The 3% GAC rabbits showed significantly higher total protein, globulin, and IgM values than the control group. However, all GAC treatments significantly improved serum IgG and the best value was found in the 3% GAC group. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that feeding lactating rabbits a diet supplemented with GAC could be considered a good strategy to enhance immunity, protein profile, MY and milk fat. The best results were obtained with the GAC 3% treatment.",

Among these, the seeds of the Zibibbo grape from Pantelleria, a native species of southern Italy, remain largely unexplored and are usually considered waste material from viticulture. Nevertheless, Zibibbo grape seeds may offer health benefits, particularly for the elderly and people with metabolic disorders, due to their potential content of beneficial compounds such as polyphenols. METHODS: The Zibibbo grape seeds extract (ZSE) was characterized using UV-visible spectrophotometry and HPLC chromatography. The antioxidant activity of ZSE was measured by different colorimetric assays and Electronic Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR). Additionally, specific in vitro tests were conducted on human osteoblast cell lines (Saos-2 and MG63) aiming to evaluate the ZSE's effects on bone turnover and metabolism. Western blotting was used to assess the impact on specific proteins and pathways related to bone health. RESULTS: The ZSE contained almost ~3 mg/mL of carbohydrates and phenolic compounds, including rutin (~6.4 ppm) and hesperidin (~44.6 ppm). The extracts exhibited an antioxidant activity greater than 90% across all tests performed. Moreover, the Zibibbo seed extracts exerted a significant proliferative effect on the Saos-2 cell human osteoblast-like cell line, also modulating the phosphorylation of specific kinases involved in cell health and metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Zibibbo grape seeds are rich in phenolic compounds, especially flavonoids with strong antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties. ZSE demonstrated beneficial effects on bone metabolism and osteoblast proliferation, suggesting potential for counteracting osteodegenerative conditions like osteoporosis. If confirmed through further studies, Zibibbo grape seed phenolic compounds could serve as an adjunctive therapy for osteoporosis, helping to slow aging and bone degeneration."

However, research on the regulatory effects of prickly ash seeds (PASs) during rumen development or on the rumen microbiome and its metabolites in sheep is limited. The current study was designed to explore the effects of PASs on sheep rumen development and growth performance using metagenomics and metabolomics. Eighteen 3-month-old Hu lambs were randomly allotted to three different dietary treatment groups: 0% (basal diet, CK), 3% (CK with 3% PAS, low-dose PAS, LPS), and 6% (CK with 6% PAS, high-dose PAS, HPS) PASs. The lambs were slaughtered to evaluate production performance. Our results showed that dietary PAS addition improved the average daily gain and reduced the F/G ratio of the experimental animals. Additionally, the height and width of the rumen papilla in the treatment groups were significantly higher than those in the CK group. The fermentation parameters showed that the levels of acetate and butyrate were significantly higher in the LPS group than in the CK and HPS groups. The propionate levels in the HPS group were significantly higher than those in the CK and LPS groups. Metagenomics analysis revealed that PAS dietary supplementation improved the abundance of Clostridiales and Bacteroidales and reduced the abundance of Prevotella, Butyrivibrio, and Methanococcus. Metabolomic analyses revealed that increased metabolite levels, such as those of serotonin, L-isoleucine, and L-valine, were closely related to growth-related metabolic pathways. The correlations analyzed showed that papilla height and muscular thickness were positively and negatively correlated with serotonin and L-valine, respectively. Average daily gain (ADG) was positively and negatively correlated with L-valine and several Prevotella, respectively. In addition, muscular thickness was positively correlated with Sodaliphilus pleomorphus, four Prevotella strains, Sarcina_sp_DSM_11001, and Methanobrevibacter_thaueri. Overall, PAS addition improved sheep growth performance by regulating beneficial microorganism and metabolite abundances, facilitating bacterial and viral invasion resistance."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading causes of death worldwide. The main risk factors are hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and increased serum lipids. The peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), also known as the groundnut, goober, pindar, or monkey nut, belongs to the Fabaceae family and is the fourth most cultivated oilseed in the world. The seeds and skin of peanuts possess a rich phytochemical profile composed of antioxidants, such as phenolic acids, stilbenes, flavonoids, and phytosterols. Peanut consumption can provide numerous health benefits, such as anti-obesity, antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and hypolipidemic effects. Accordingly, peanuts have the potential to treat CVD and counteract its risk factors. PURPOSE: This study aims to critically evaluate the effects of peanuts on metabolic syndrome (MetS) and CVD risk factors based on clinical studies. METHOD: This review includes studies indexed in MEDLINE-PubMed, COCHRANE, and EMBASE, and the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines were adhered to. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included and indicated that the consumption of raw peanuts or differing forms of processed foods containing peanut products and phytochemicals could improve metabolic parameters, such as glycemia, insulinemia, glycated hemoglobin, lipids, body mass index, waist circumference, atherogenic indices, and endothelial function. CONCLUSION: We propose that this legume and its products be used as a sustainable and low-cost alternative for the prevention and treatment of MetS and CVD. However, further research with larger sample sizes, longer intervention durations, and more diverse populations is needed to understand the full benefit of peanut consumption in MetS and CVD."
