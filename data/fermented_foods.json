      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the anti-listeria activities of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from Korean fermented foods and to assess the effect of fermentate (cells and cell-free supernatant [CFS]), CFS or cells in controlling L. monocytogenes on smoked salmon, packaged either in vacuum- and air-packaging. One L. lactis (CJNU3001) strain and two Enterococcus faecium (CJNU2524 and CJNU2008) strains appeared to have higher anti-listeria activity than the other 15 LAB strains. They also exhibited anti-listeria activity against 24 L. monocytogenes strains of various serotypes. CJNU3001 had greater anti-listeria activity in brain heat infusion broth than the two E. faecium strains. No anti-listeria activity was observed when the partially purified proteinaceous compounds of all three LAB strains were treated with proteinase K, revealing that their anti-listeria activities might be due to bacteriocins. Amplification and sequence analysis of the nisin gene confirmed that CJNU3001 was a nisin Z producer. The treatment of fermentate and CFS of CNJU3001 on smoked salmon inoculated with L. monocytogenes at 6.0 log CFU/g inhibited the growth of the pathogen during storage. On the other hand, about 2.0 log reduction was achieved immediately after treatment of the fermentate and CFS of CNJU3001 when L. monocytogenes was inoculated at 5.0 log CFU/g, regardless of storage temperature and packaging type. The treatment using only CJNU3001 cells was not effective in controlling L. monocytogenes on smoked salmon, regardless of inoculation level of the pathogen. The fermentate and CFS treatment of CJNU3001 did not cause any color change of vacuum-packed smoked salmon. Thus, this study suggests that CJNU3001 fermentate and CFS as biopreservatives could be used to control the growth of L. monocytogenes on smoked salmon without causing color change.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the suitability of fermented food interventions to replenish damaged gut microbiota. Metagenomic assessment of published sequencing data found that fermented food interventions led to a significant increase in the gut antibiotic resistome in healthy human subjects. Antibiotic resistome and viable antibiotic-resistant (AR) bacteria were further highly prevalent in retail kimchi and artisan cheeses by metagenomic and culture analyses. Representative AR pathogens of importance in nosocomial infections, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), as well as commensals and lactic acid bacteria, were characterized; some exhibited an extremely high minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against antibiotics of clinical significance. Exposing fermented food microbiota to representative antibiotics further led to a boost of the corresponding antibiotic and multidrug-resistance gene pools, as well as disturbed microbiota, including the rise of previously undetectable pathogens. These results revealed an underestimated public health risk associated with fermented food intervention at the current stage, particularly for susceptible populations with compromised gut integrity and immune functions seeking gut microbiota rescue. The findings call for productive intervention of foodborne AR via technology innovation and strategic movements to mitigate unnecessary, massive damages to the host gut microbiota due to orally administered or biliary excreted antibiotics."

      "abstract": "Several strategies, programs and policies have long been developed and implemented to alleviate child malnutrition in sub-Saharan African countries. However, stunting and wasting still persist at an alarming rate, suggesting that alternative strategies are needed to induce faster progress toward the 2030 SDGs targets of reducing malnutrition. Gut microbiota-directed intervention is now being recognized as an unconventional powerful approach to mitigate malnutrition and improve overall child health. In an African setting, manufactured probiotic and synbiotic foods or supplements may not be successful owing to the non-affordability and high attachment of African populations to their food tradition. This review analyses the potential of indigenous fermented cereal-based products including porridges, doughs, beverages, bread- and yoghurt-like products, to be used as microbiota-directed foods for over 6 months children. The discussion includes relevant strategies to effectively enhance the beneficial effects of these products on gut microbiota composition for improved child health and nutrition in sub-Saharan Africa. Characterization of probiotic features and general safety of food processing in sub-Saharan Africa as well as randomized clinical studies are still lacking to fully ascertain the health effects and suitability of these fermented foods in preventing and treating child malnutrition and diarrhea."

      "abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides, such as bacteriocin, produced by probiotics have become a promising novel class of therapeutic agents for treating infectious diseases. Selected lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from fermented foods with probiotic potential were evaluated for various tests, including exopolysaccharide production, antibiotic susceptibility, acid and bile tolerance, antibacterial activity, and cell adhesion and cytotoxicity to gastric cell lines. Six selected LAB strains maintained their high viability under gastrointestinal conditions, produced high exopolysaccharides, showed no or less cytotoxicity, and adhered successfully to gastric cells. Furthermore, three strains, Weissella confusa CYLB30, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum CYLB47, and Limosilactobacillus fermentum CYLB55, demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect against drug-resistant Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis, Enterococcus faecium, and Staphylococcus aureus. Whole genome sequencing was performed on these three strains using the Nanopore platform; then, the results showed that all three strains did not harbor genes related to toxins, superantigens, and acquired antimicrobial resistance, in their genome. The bacteriocin gene cluster was found in CYLB47 genome, but not in CYLB30 and CYLB55 genomes. In SDS-PAGE, the extract of CYLB30 and CYLB47 bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (BLIS) yielded a single band with a size of less than 10 kDa. These BLIS inhibited the growth and biofilm formation of drug-resistant P. aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), causing membrane disruption and inhibiting adhesion ability to human skin HaCaT cells. Moreover, CYLB30 and CYLB47 BLIS rescued the larvae after being infected with P. aeruginosa and MRSA infections. In conclusion, CYLB30 and CYLB47 BLIS may be potential alternative treatment for multidrug-resistant bacteria infections.",

      "abstract": "Over the past two decades, whole food supplementation strategies have been leveraged to target mental health. In addition, there has been increasing attention on the ability of gut microbes, so called psychobiotics, to positively impact behaviour though the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Fermented foods offer themselves as a combined whole food microbiota modulating intervention. Indeed, they contain potentially beneficial microbes, microbial metabolites and other bioactives, which are being harnessed to target the microbiota-gut-brain axis for positive benefits. This review highlights the diverse nature of fermented foods in terms of the raw materials used and type of fermentation employed, and summarises their potential to shape composition of the gut microbiota, the gut to brain communication pathways including the immune system and, ultimately, modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Throughout, we identify knowledge gaps and challenges faced in designing human studies for investigating the mental health-promoting potential of individual fermented foods or components thereof. Importantly, we also suggest solutions that can advance understanding of the therapeutic merit of fermented foods to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis.",

METHODS: In this article, we systematically reviewed the evidence on the influence of probiotic supplementation on CD4 lymphocyte count, viral load and anaemia among PLHIV on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and those who were HAART-naive. Medical literature databases identified randomised trials and pre-post studies of probiotic supplementation and HIV-related outcomes, and random effects meta-analysis was conducted. RESULTS: The preponderance of the evidence suggests that probiotic supplementation only improved CD4 lymphocyte count modestly, with quantitatively greater impact among individuals who were HAART-naive compared to HAART-experienced individuals. Probiotic supplementation improved CD4 lymphocyte count by 53 cells/mm3 (95% CI: 22 to 85) from 18 studies. Probiotic supplementation however reduced haemoglobin concentration by -2.1 g/L (95% CI: -4.0 to -0.2). Although viral load remain unchanged in HAART-experienced participants following probiotic supplementation, HAART-naïve participants saw a decrease in viral load. There were too few studies on the impact of probiotic supplementation on viral load (N = 1). CONCLUSION: Probiotic supplementation resulted in a modest increase in CD4 lymphocyte count among HAART-naive individuals with no significant change observed among HAART-experienced ones. Viral load and haemoglobin concentration also remained unchanged following probiotic supplementation. Further rigorous and well-powered studies may evaluate the effect of probiotic supplementation on important clinical outcomes among PLHIV on HAART.",

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a global health problem and leading cause of death worldwide. Thrombus formation, one of the CVDs, is essentially the formation of fibrin clots. The existing thrombolytic agents have the disadvantages of high price, short half-life, and high bleeding risk; hence, there is an urgent need to find the alternative thrombolytic agents. In recent years, traditional fermented foods have been widely investigated for their outstanding effects in the prevention and treatment of thrombus formation. In this review, we have focused on fibrinolytic enzymes produced by microorganisms during the fermentation of traditional fermented foods and their potential use for treating CVDs. First, we discussed about the sources of fibrinolytic enzymes and microbial strains that produce those enzymes followed by the optimization of fermentation process, purification, and physicochemical properties of fibrinolytic enzymes. Finally, we have summarized the thrombolytic effects of fibrinolytic enzymes in humans and mice. Fibrinolytic enzymes produced by microorganisms during the fermentation of traditional fermented foods not only lyse thrombi but also acts as anti-atherosclerotic, anti-hyperlipidemia, and neuroprotection agents. Therefore, fibrinolytic enzymes from traditional fermented foods have great potential for the prevention and treatment of CVDs."

The PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, the Cochrane Library and Scopus databases were searched up to 21 June, 2022. English-language RCTs of fermented foods consumption were included which gave metabolic outcomes on body composition, glucose control, insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, as well as blood pressure. Eighteen RCTs met the inclusion criteria and 843 participants were included in the final analysis. The pooled results showed a significant reduction of fasting blood glucose (FBG), the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), total cholesterol (TC), low density lipid cholesterol (LDL-C) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in the intervention group versus the control group. The results of this research showed that fermented foods have the potential to improve some metabolic outcomes, including FBG, HOMA-IR, TC, LDL-C, and DBP in patients with diabetes and prediabetes.",

Using probiotics or bioactive peptides as therapeutic adjuncts appears superior to standard care alone. Probiotics play critical roles in innate and adaptive immune modulation by balancing the gut microbiota to combat viral infections, secondary bacterial infections and microbial dysbiosis. African fermented foods contain abundant potential probiotic microorganisms such as the lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Saccharomyces, and Bacillus. More so, fermented food-derived bioactive peptides play vital roles in preventing cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, lung injury, diabetes, and other COVID-19 comorbidities. Regularly incorporating potential probiotics and bioactive peptides into diets should enable a build-up of the benefits in the body system that may result in a better prognosis, especially in COVID-19 patients with underlying complexities. Despite the reported therapeutic potentials of probiotics and fermented foods, numerous setbacks exist regarding their application in disease management. These shortfalls underscore an evident need for more studies to evaluate the specific potentials of probiotics and traditional fermented foods in ameliorating SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections."

At the same time, significant amounts of pesticides remain in food and their ingestion causes serious damage such as neurological, gastrointestinal, and allergic reactions; cancer; and even death. However, during the fermentation processing of foods, residual amounts of pesticides are significantly reduced thanks to enzymatic degradation by the starter and accompanying microflora. This review concentrates on foods with the highest levels of pesticide residues, such as milk, yogurt, fermented vegetables (pickles, kimchi, and olives), fruit juices, grains, sourdough, and wines. The focus is on the molecular mechanisms of pesticide degradation due to the presence of specific microbial species. They contain a unique genetic pool that confers an appropriate enzymological profile to act as pesticide detoxifiers. The prospects of developing more effective biodetoxification strategies by engaging probiotic lactic acid bacteria are also discussed."

The microbial composition of fermented sausage was analyzed [aerobic bacteria (AC), Lactobacillus spp. (LABC), Staphylococcus spp. (STPC), and yeast and mold (YMC)], and pH and electronic nose and tongue measurements were taken. The AC, LABC, STPC, and YMC values of the control and treatment groups tended to increase during fermentation (p>0.05). The STPC values of the GD, GS, ND, and GDS groups were similar to that of the control on day 3. The pH of the control on day 3 was significantly lower than that of the GD, ND, and GND groups (p<0.05). Higher levels of 4-methylpentanol, 2-furanmethanol, and propyl nonanoate, which provide a \"fermented\" flavor, were detected in the GD group compared to in the control and other treatment groups. GD and ND groups showed higher umami values than the control and other treatment groups. Therefore, it is expected that GD can be valuable as a starter culture unique to Korea when manufacturing fermented sausage."

In addition to bioactive molecules, several fermented foods, particularly dairy products, provide the host with live microorganisms, thus carrying potential \"genetic/functional\" nutrients. To date, a proper ontology to structure and formalize the concepts used to describe fermented foods is lacking. Here we describe a semantic representation of concepts revolving around what consuming fermented foods entails, both from a technological and health point of view, focusing actions on kefir and Parmigiano Reggiano, as representatives of fresh and ripened dairy products. We included concepts related to the connection of specific microbial taxa to the dairy fermentation process, demonstrating the potential of ontologies to formalize the various gene pathways involved in raw ingredient transformation, connect them to resulting metabolites, and finally to their consequences on the fermented product, including technological, health and sensory aspects. Our work marks an improvement in the ambition of creating a harmonized semantic model for integrating different aspects of modern nutritional science. Such a model, besides formalizing a multifaceted knowledge, will be pivotal for a rich annotation of data in public repositories, as a prerequisite to generalized meta-analysis."

      "abstract": "The focus on managing Alzheimer's disease (AD) is shifting towards prevention through lifestyle modification instead of treatments since the currently available treatment options are only capable of providing symptomatic relief marginally and result in various side effects. Numerous studies have reported that the intake of fermented foods resulted in the successful management of AD. Food fermentation is a biochemical process where the microorganisms metabolize the constituents of raw food materials, giving vastly different organoleptic properties and additional nutritional value, and improved biosafety effects in the final products. The consumption of fermented foods is associated with a wide array of nutraceutical benefits, including anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, anti-apoptotic, anti-cancer, anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, immunomodulatory, and hypocholesterolemic properties. Due to their promising health benefits, fermented food products have a great prospect for commercialization in the food industry. This paper reviews the memory and cognitive enhancement and neuroprotective potential of fermented food products on AD, the recently commercialized fermented food products in the health and food industries, and their limitations. The literature reviewed here demonstrates a growing demand for fermented food products as alternative therapeutic options for the prevention and management of AD."

      "abstract": "Background: Diarrhoeal disease is a major cause of global infant mortality, and compromises the ability of many countries with respect to achieving sustainable development goals. The WHO's recommendation of Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) and zinc in the management of this disease, may not be readily available. Consideration and assessment of cultural practices in its management has been an area of increased interest over the last decade. Aim: This study aims to systematically evaluate efficacy of the consumption of traditional fermented foods as functional products for the treatment and management of diarrhoea. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review was conducted of electronic databases (Cochrane Library, Ovid Medline and Pubmed) databases with no restrictions on language and publication date for RCTs that investigated the effect of consumption of fermented foods on the treatment of diarrhoea in children under five years of age. Results: Seven RCTs were included. Meta-analysis showed that compared to control, consumption of fermented foods significantly reduced mean duration of diarrhoea, -0.61 days; (95% CI, -1.04, -0.18); length of hospitalization, -0.35 days (95% CI, -0.69, -0.02); but not mean daily frequency of stool -2.00 (95% CI,-7.03, 3.04). Conclusion: Limited available evidence suggests that consumption of fermented foods may help reduce duration and severity of symptoms as a treatment of diarrhoea. More high quality research needs to be undertaken to investigate the efficacy of fermented food as an effective alternative to ORS as a potential WHO recommendation for management of diarrhoeal disease.",

      "abstract": "In underdeveloped and developing countries, due to poverty, fermentation is one of the most widely used preservation methods. It not only allows extending the shelf life of food, but also brings other benefits, including inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microorganisms, improving the organoleptic properties and product digestibility, and can be a valuable source of functional microorganisms. Today, there is a great interest in functional strains, which, in addition to typical probiotic strains, can participate in the treatment of numerous diseases, disorders of the digestive system, but also mental diseases, or stimulate our immune system. Hence, fermented foods and beverages are not only a part of the traditional diet, e.g., in Africa but also play a role in the nutrition of people around the world. The fermentation process for some products occurs spontaneously, without the use of well-defined starter cultures, under poorly controlled or uncontrolled conditions. Therefore, while this affordable technology has many advantages, it can also pose a potential health risk. The use of poor-quality ingredients, inadequate hygiene conditions in the manufacturing processes, the lack of standards for safety and hygiene controls lead to the failure food safety systems implementation, especially in low- and middle-income countries or for small-scale products (at household level, in villages and scale cottage industries). This can result in the presence of pathogenic microorganisms or their toxins in the food contributing to cases of illness or even outbreaks. Also, improper processing and storage, as by well as the conditions of sale affect the food safety. Foodborne diseases through the consumption of traditional fermented foods are not reported frequently, but this may be related, among other things, to a low percentage of people entering healthcare care or weaknesses in foodborne disease surveillance systems. In many parts of the world, especially in Africa and Asia, pathogens such as enterotoxigenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., enterotoxigenic Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Bacillus cereus have been detected in fermented foods. Therefore, this review, in addition to the positive aspects, presents the potential risk associated with the consumption of this type of products."

A total of 66 LAB strains were screened using dual culture assays. This showed that four LAB strains were very effective in inhibiting growth of T. rubrum but not T. interdigitale. More detailed studies with Lactobacillus plantarum strain HT-W104-B1 showed that the supernatant was mainly responsible for inhibiting the growth of T. rubrum. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), inhibitory concentration, the 50% growth inhibition (IC50) and minimum fungicide concentration (MFC) were 20 mg/mL, 14 mg/mL and 30 mg/mL, respectively. A total of six metabolites were found in the supernatant, with the two major metabolites being L-lactic acid (19.1 mg/g cell dry weight (CDW)) and acetic acid (2.2 mg/g CDW). A comparative study on keratin agar media showed that the natural mixture in the supernatants predominantly contained L-lactic and acetic acid, and this significantly controlled the growth of T. rubrum. The pure two individual compounds were less effective. Potential exists for application of the natural mixture of compounds for the treatment of skin infection by T. rubrum.",

      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa is a serious psychiatric disorder with high morbidity and mortality rate. Evidence for the optimal psychopharmacological approach to managing the disorder remains limited, with nutritional treatment, focused on weight restoration through the consumption of high energy diet, regarded as one of the fundamental steps in treatment. The human gut microbiome is increasingly recognised for its proposed role in gastrointestinal, metabolic, immune and mental health, all of which may be compromised in individuals with anorexia nervosa. Dietary intake plays an important role in shaping gut microbiota composition, whilst the use of fermented foods, foods with potential psychobiotic properties that deliver live bacteria, bacterial metabolites, prebiotics and energy, have been discussed to a lesser extent. However, fermented foods are of increasing interest due to their potential capacity to affect gut microbiota composition, provide beneficial bacterial metabolites, and confer beneficial outcomes to host health. This review provides an overview of the role of the gut microbiota in relation to the disease pathology in anorexia nervosa and especially focuses on the therapeutic potential of fermented foods, proposed here as a recommended addition to the current nutritional treatment protocols warranting further investigation.",

The probiotic (PRO) group (n=7) were rats pre-treated with antibiotics for 7 days followed by 14-day probiotic administration, antibiotics (ANT) group (n=7) were rats treated with antibiotics for 21 days without probiotics. The control (CON) group (n=7) were rats that received sham treatment for 21 days. The six bacterial strains with probiotic properties were mostly isolated from Thai fermented foods; Pedicoccus pentosaceus WS11, Lactobacillus plantarum SK321, L. fermentum SK324, L. brevis TRBC 3003, Bifidobacterium adolescentis TBRC 7154 and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis TBRC 375. The probiotics were freeze-dried into powder (6×109 CFU/5 g) and administered to the PRO group via oral gavage. Behavioral tests were performed. The PRO group displayed significantly reduced anxiety level and increased locomotor function using a marble burying test and open field test, respectively and significantly improved short-term memory performance using a novel object recognition test. Antibiotics significantly reduced microbial counts in rat feces in the ANT group by 100 fold compared to the PRO group. Probiotics significantly enhanced antioxidant enzymatic and non-enzymatic defenses in rat brains as assessed using catalase activity and ferric reducing antioxidant power assay, respectively. Probiotics also showed neuroprotective effects with less pyknotic cells and lower frequency of vacuolization in cerebral cortex. This multi-strain probiotic formulation from Thai fermented foods may offer a potential to develop psychobiotic-rich functional foods to modulate human mind and behaviors."

In total, 22 studies (n = 1551) were included that investigated probiotics (11 studies, n = 724), prebiotics (5 studies, n = 355), and fermented foods (6 studies, n = 472). Despite several individual studies (14 of 22) reporting significant improvements in specific cognitive domains, results of the pooled meta-analysis found no significant effect for any intervention for global cognition (Probiotics: g = 0.115, 95 %CI -0.041, 0.270, p = 0.148; Prebiotics: g = 0.077, 95 %CI -0.091, 0.246, p = 0.369; Fermented food: g = 0.164 95 %CI -0.017, 0.345, p = 0.076) or any individual cognitive domain. Most studies (16 of 22) had low risk of bias. These results do not support the use of probiotic, prebiotic, and fermented food interventions for cognitive outcomes. This may be due to the limited number of small and short-term studies as well clinical heterogeneity relating to the population, cognitive tests, and intervention.

Both NKs contain substitutions of D41N, V192A and 252-RLQHTLEALSTM-263 but NatOC has additional V4F. In the present study, the effects of amino acid substitutions in NK variants and G169A in DFE on their enzyme characteristics were evaluated. Pure proteins were obtained using two sequential steps chromatography using ion exchange and a gel filtration columns. Their activities were determined with fibrin plate, fibrin zymography, fibrinogen hydrolysis, and chromogenic assays. The fibrinogen degradation profile of the wild type NK (NatWT) was different to the NK variants but similar to DFEs. Optimum activity of all the NKs and DFEs was achieved at 50 °C while the optimum pH for NatWT/DFEs and NK variants were 8 and 7, respectively. DFEG169A exhibited higher fibrinogen degradation rate and fibrin specific activity than DFE. PMSF inhibited all the NKs and DFEs while SDS and EDTA caused lower activity. The NK variants were more resistant towards Na+ and Ca2+ but more sensitive to K+. The amino acid substitutions in NK variants alter their fibrinogen degradation profile, optimum working pH, working pH range, and resistance to some ions. Substitutions in NK variants likely promote structural changes, particularly with the binding mode of the calcium ion cofactor. The results provide a beneficial basis for future development of fibrino(gen)olytic proteins with improved properties for cardiovascular diseases therapy.",

There is a growing body of scientific evidence to suggest that gut dysbiosis (microbial imbalance of the intestine) is associated with inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease and asthma). Regular consumption of fermented foods (e.g., kimchi, kefir, etc.) may represent a potential avenue to counter the proinflammatory effects of gut dysbiosis. However, an assessment of the available literature in this research area is lacking. Here we provide a critical review of current human intervention studies that analyzed the effect of fermented foods on the composition and/or function of the human gut microbiota. A total of 19 human intervention studies were identified that met this search criteria. In this review, we discuss evidence that consumption of fermented foods may modify the gut microbiota in humans. Further, there is cursory evidence to suggest that gut microbiota compositional changes mediate associations between fermented food consumption and human health outcomes. Although promising, there remains considerable heterogeneity in the human populations targeted in the intervention studies we identified. Larger longitudinal feeding studies with longer follow-up are necessary to confirm and enhance the current data. Further, future studies should consider analyzing microbiota function as a means to elucidate the mechanism linking fermented food consumption with human health. This review highlights methodologic considerations for intervention trials, emphasizing an expanse of research opportunities related to fermented food consumption in humans.",

Recent clinical trials have assessed whether botanical fermented foods (BFFs) have beneficial effects on metabolic biomarkers, inflammatory markers and gut microbiota. The aim of this review is to critically evaluate all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of BFF for evidence of impact on the outcome measures of these disease states. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Four electronic databases (Embase, MEDLINE, CENTRAL and Google Scholar) as well as the grey literature will be searched from inception to present without language or publication status restrictions applied. Eligible RCTs which have enrolled adult participants with T2DM, any MetS components or combinations of these components, treated prophylactically or therapeutically with any botanical fermented food intervention, compared with a control group (no intervention, placebo or active control) will be assessed. Primary outcomes are related to the target conditions, including metabolic biomarkers, inflammatory markers and gut microbiota composition/function. Using Covidence, two independent investigators will conduct title and abstract screening, followed by full-text screening to identify appropriate studies. Methodological quality of the trials will be assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Findings will be summarised with a narrative synthesis of the differences between included studies. A meta-analysis will be conducted if sufficient data are obtained. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required as primary data will not be collected. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication, conference presentations and press.

Since the awareness about the health benefits of FFs has increased, the consumption of FF also improved significantly in recent decades. Diabetes is one of the leading threats of the health span of an individual. The present manuscript details the general methods of the production of FFs, and the results of various studies (in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies) on the antidiabetic properties of FFs. The fermentation method and the active microbes involved in the process play a crucial role in the functional properties of FFs. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have been reported on the health-promoting properties of FFs, such as anti-inflammation, anticancer, antioxidant properties, improved cognitive function and gastrointestinal health, and the reduced presence of metabolic disorders. The studies on the functional properties of FFs by randomized controlled clinical trials using human volunteers are very limited for several reasons, including ethical reasons, safety concerns, approval from the government, etc. Several scientific teams are working on the development of complementary and alternative medicines to improve the treatment strategies for hyperglycemia.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: This study evaluated the antibiotic-induced changes in microbial ecology, intestinal dysbiosis and low-grade inflammation; and the combined effect of four different Lactobacillus species on recovery of microbiota composition and improvement of gut barrier function in mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Administration of the antibiotic ampicillin for 2 weeks decreased microbial community diversity, induced caecum tumefaction and increased gut permeability in mice. Application of a probiotic cocktail of four Lactobacillus species (JUP-Y4) modulated the microbiota community structure and promoted the abundance of potentially beneficial bacteria such as Akkermansia. Ampicillin administration led to a decline in Bacteroidetes from 46·6 ± 3·91% to 0·264 ± 0·0362%; the addition of JUP-Y4 restored this to 41·4 ± 2·87%. This probiotic supplementation was more effective than natural restoration, where the levels of Bacteroidetes were only restored to 29·3 ± 2·07%. Interestingly, JUP-Y4 treatment was more effective in the restoration of microbiota in faecal samples than in caecal samples. JUP-Y4 also significantly reduced the levels of d-lactate and endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) in the serum of mice, and increased the expression of tight-junction proteins while reducing the production of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, IFN-γ and IL-1β) in the ileum and the colon of antibiotic-treated mice. CONCLUSIONS: JUP-Y4 not only promoted recovery from antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis, but also enhanced the function of the gut barrier, reduced inflammation and lowered levels of circulating endotoxin in mice. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Consumption of a mixture of Lactobacillus species may encourage faster recovery from antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis and gut microbiota-related immune disturbance.",

In this study, the differential cytokine regulatory effect was examined with three isolates of lactobacilli strains; namely, Lactobacillus plantarum K55-5 isolated from dairy product, and L. sakei K101 and L. plantarum K8 previously isolated from kimchi (a Korean traditional fermented vegetable). Production of cytokines such as IL-10, IL-12, IFN-γ, and TNF-α was significantly increased in L. sakei K101- and L. plantarum K55-5-treated splenocytes as compared with controls. The oral administration of L. sakei K101 and L. plantarum K55-5 increased cytokine production in the immunosuppressed mouse splenocytes and blood. NK cell cytotoxic activity was also increased in L. sakei K101- and L. plantarum K55-5-fed mice. On the other hand, L. plantarum K8 did not affect cytokine induction in all the experiments performed in this study. The cytokine-inducing effect of L. plantarum K55-5 was significantly increased by lysates of heat-killed bacteria as compared with live, heat-killed, or supernatant of cell lysates. TNF-α production by lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) isolated from the three isolates of lactobacilli was compared, and it was found that K55-5 LTA had a highest cytokine-inducing ability, which was mediated by TLR2-mediated NF-κB and ERK activation. Taken together, our study suggests that L. plantarum K55-5 and L. sakei K101 can be used for the treatment of immunosuppressed disorders.",

However, no studies have examined the relationship between probiotics and social anxiety. Here we employ a cross-sectional approach to determine whether consumption of fermented foods likely to contain probiotics interacts with neuroticism to predict social anxiety symptoms. A sample of young adults (N=710, 445 female) completed self-report measures of fermented food consumption, neuroticism, and social anxiety. An interaction model, controlling for demographics, general consumption of healthful foods, and exercise frequency, showed that exercise frequency, neuroticism, and fermented food consumption significantly and independently predicted social anxiety. Moreover, fermented food consumption also interacted with neuroticism in predicting social anxiety. Specifically, for those high in neuroticism, higher frequency of fermented food consumption was associated with fewer symptoms of social anxiety. Taken together with previous studies, the results suggest that fermented foods that contain probiotics may have a protective effect against social anxiety symptoms for those at higher genetic risk, as indexed by trait neuroticism. While additional research is necessary to determine the direction of causality, these results suggest that consumption of fermented foods that contain probiotics may serve as a low-risk intervention for reducing social anxiety.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Food-borne infections cause huge economic and human life losses worldwide. The most common contaminants of foods include Listeria monocytogenes Salmonellae and Staphylococcus aureus. L. monocytogenes is most notorious due to its tolerance to common food preservation methods and the risks it poses, including higher fatality rates. Safer, more efficacious control methods are thus needed. Along with food-borne pathogens, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) can also be found in foods. Some LAB isolates inhibit pathogenic bacteria by various mechanisms, including by production of antimicrobial metabolites. METHODS: The potential of cell-free culture supernatants (CFS) derived from broth cultures of selected local LAB and yeast isolates, some of which were subjected to various treatments, were tested for inhibition of L. monocytogenes, Salmonella spp. and S. aureus in in vitro culture by incorporating various proportions of the CFSs into the growth medium concurrently with inoculation (co-cultures) or following limited proliferation after inoculation of the pathogens (delayed cultures). The effects of the CFSs on various growth parameters were assessed. RESULTS: CFS from the LAB isolates were strongly inhibitory when co-cultured. The inhibitory activities were stable following heat or protease treatment of the CFSs. Inhibitory activity was dependent primarily on active substance(s) secreted into the supernatant. In all co-cultures, CFS proportion-dependent progressive decrease in the number of colonies was observed and both growth rates and number of generations were reduced with significantly fewer numbers of colony forming units, whereas generation times were significantly increased compared to those of controls. Transfer from co-cultures to fresh broth showed inhibited cultures contained bacteria that can re-grow, indicating the presence of viable bacteria that are undetectable by culture. Growth rates in CFS-treated delayed cultures were also reduced to varying degrees with the number of colonies in some cultures being significantly less than the corresponding control values. CFSs were active against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Active metabolites produced and secreted by LAB into the growth medium were effective in inhibiting the tested pathogens. Early addition of the CFSs was necessary for significant inhibition to occur. Further studies will help make these findings applicable to food safety.",

From 529 isolates of lactic acid bacteria, 121 isolates were able to inhibit the growth of certain bacterial strains. Of these 121 isolates, only 11 produced antibacterial agents that were capable of inhibiting the growth of multiple bacterial strains in a liquid medium. One strain (KKU 170) of these 11 isolates produced an antibacterial agent that could strongly inhibit the growth of selected strains of gram-positive bacteria including Listeria sp. The antibacterial agent produced by the strain KKU 170 was identified as a bacteriocin since it was inactivated by proteinase K treatment. The strain KKU 170 was identified as Pediococcus acidilactici by both biochemical tests and molecular biological techniques. Optimal production of bacteriocin by the strain KKU 170 was found in culture medium containing 0.2% glucose, at an initial culture pH of 6.5, and temperature of 45 ºC. The maximum bacteriocin activity (1600 AU ml(-1)) was reached at the late exponential phase of growth and displayed primary metabolite production. The partially purified bacteriocin of the strain KKU 170 was tolerant to heat treatment at 121 ºC for 30 min.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of 197 isolates of Lactobacillus paracasei, isolated from Italian fermented products coming from different geographical areas, to tetracycline and erythromycin, two antimicrobials widely used in clinical and animal therapy. Isolation media were supplemented with antibiotics according to the microbiological breakpoints (BPs) defined by European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Isolates were identified at the species level and were typed by rep-PCR using the (GTG)(5) primer. A total of 121 genotypically different strains were detected and their phenotypic antimicrobial resistance to tetracycline and erythromycin was determined as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using the broth microdilution method. The presence of the genes ermB, ermC and tetL, tetM, tetS, tetW, in the phenotypically resistant isolates was investigated by PCR. Tetracycline induction of tetM expression on representative resistant strains, grown in medium either lacking or containing the antibiotic, was also analyzed by RT-PCR. Among the 121 tested strains, 77.7% were susceptible to tetracycline (MIC<or=4 microg/ml; BP=4 microg/ml) and 94.2% to erythromycin (MIC<or=1 microg/ml; BP=1 microg/ml). Overall, 27 strains appeared to be resistant to tetracycline (16<or=MIC<or=128 microg/ml ) (Tet(R)), and 7 of them were also resistant to erythromycin (MIC>or=1024 microg/ml) (Erm(R)). The tetM and ermB genes were the most frequently detected in the Tet(R) and/or Erm(R) strains. The tetM expression was induced by antibiotic addition to the growth medium. Our study confirmed that L. paracasei is quite sensitive to tetracycline and erythromycin, but the high level of resistance of Erm(R) strains suggested that acquired resistance took place. Further investigations are required to analyze whether the genes identified in L. paracasei isolates might be horizontally transferred to other species. Since \"commensal\" bacteria, which L. paracasei belongs to, may play an active role in the spreading of antibiotic resistance, a series of measures inspired from a principle of precaution should be taken before they are used as commercial starters or probiotic cultures in food products, complemented by a more prudent use of antibiotics in agriculture, veterinary, and human medicine.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: With the adoption of vigorous child survival strategies, infant and child mortalities in India have declined significantly, even among the poorest, most undernourished segments of the population. Of the surviving infants and children, however, many remain stunted and undernourished. The present study was based on the hypothesis that failure to thrive is the result of damage to the gut epithelium incurred during repeated bouts of gastrointestinal infections. Promoting the regeneration of the damaged gut epithelium through the use of lactobacillus-rich fermented foods may yield beneficial results. This low-cost procedure can be widely used, even in poor communities. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effect in poor Indian communities of supplementation with a probiotic on the growth of children (aged 2 to 5 years) with growth retardation and assess the difference in morbidity between those receiving the supplement (n = 50) and the control group (n = 50), mainly with respect to the frequency, severity, and duration of diarrheal episodes. METHODS: One hundred children aged 2 to 5 y from an urban slum of New Delhi were matched for their age (+/-36 d), sex and weight (+/-1 kg) and assigned to one of two groups (experimental n= 50 and control n= 50). The experimental group received a probiotic supplement (50 ml curd containing Lactobacillus acidophilus) and the control group received an isocaloric supplement daily for 6 mo. Weight, height, and morbidity profile with respect to diarrhea, fever, cough, and cold was recorded. RESULTS: Increases in weight (P < 0.002) and height (P < 0.001) were significantly greater in the experimental group than in the control group. In addition, after 6 mo, of supplementation, there were fewer cases of diarrhea (P < 0.005) and fever (P < 0.001) in the intervention group then in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: From this study, it can be concluded that 6 mo of probiotic supplementation may be beneficial with respect to decrease in diarrheal morbidity and accelerated growth in the experimental group.",

Maximum weight was given to increasing consumption of iddli, a popular cereal-based-fermented food, or of gooseberry juice. Four small factories were selected in periurban Bangalore, with a sample of 302 women. The 180-day interventions were supervised at the workplace. In unit 1 (72 women), the intervention consisted of iddli four times a week plus information, education, and communication (IEC) related to iron-deficiency anemia. Unit 2 (80 women) received 20 ml of gooseberry juice (containing 40 mg of vitamin C) three times a week plus IEC once a month. Women in unit 3 (70 women), the positive control, received 400 mg albendazole once plus ferrous sulfate tablets (60 mg elemental iron) two times a week. No IEC was given. Unit 4 (70 women) served as the negative control and received no intervention. The pre-post impact measures were dietary and nutrient intake, knowledge and practice, and hemoglobin status. In units 1, 2, and 3, the hemoglobin status of the women improved significantly from 11.10 to 12.30 g/dl, 11.20 to 12.70 g/dl, and 11.50 to 13.00 g/dl, respectively. In unit 4 there was no change: the values were 10.90 g/dl before and after intervention. The results show that the type of workplace lunch was of greater significance than IEC. Knowledge gains were impressive, but behavioral change was not sustained. It was concluded that the hemoglobin levels of the workers can easily be improved by cost-effective workplace lunches that also lead to better employer-employee relations.",

Critical steps for the extraction were: cell recovery by differential centrifugation; cell wall digestion with both mutanolysin and lysozyme; and CTAB treatment for the elimination of starch. Digestion of starch with alpha-amylase did not improve extraction yields. The method yielded high amounts of RNA from pozol, a Mexican maize-based fermented food, and was found to extract total RNA efficiently from all the micro-organisms potentially present in these ecosystems. Both rRNA and mRNA recovered were of high quality and suitable for hybridization studies.",
