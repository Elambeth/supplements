      "abstract": "Salmonella, a genus with a global presence, is a leading cause of diarrheal diseases in both humans and animals. With over 2,400 distinct serotypes, most exhibiting minimal host specificity, Salmonella infection remains a significant public health issue. It poses a substantial economic burden on both developed and developing nations due to the costs associated with disease surveillance, prevention, and treatment. To address this global challenge, it is essential to explore cost-effective therapeutic interventions derived from medicinal plants. In this study, we targeted the Salmonella SpvB ATR domain for molecular docking of phytochemical compounds. A library of 392 phytochemical compounds from the Artemisia annua (Sweet wormwood) medicinal plant was utilized. In the initial screening, the top 20 phytochemical compounds were selected based on their high binding affinity toward SpvB. These 20 compounds underwent interaction analysis, revealing that two compounds, IMPHY004808 and IMPHY015047, formed crucial interactions. The IMPHY004808 compound bound at binding site residues ARG414, ARG471, LEU473, and GLU538, with residue SER501 present at the active site. Similarly, the IMPHY015047 compound formed bonds at binding site residues ARG471, ARG414, GLY472, and GLU538, while residue SER501 was present at the active site of SpvB. The trajectory analysis of 500 ns MD simulation, including deviation, fluctuation, compactness, surface area calculation, secondary structure element alterations, and hydrogen bond analysis, showed that the complexes were stable during the simulation time. Moreover, PCA with minimal vibration, FEL analysis and MMPBSA analysis strongly recommend that the complexes were stable and further validation with experimentation is needed."

      "abstract": "ADHs are key genes that catalyze the interconversion between alcohols and aldehydes, which play crucial roles in plant adaptation to a range of abiotic stresses. However, the characterization and evolutionary pathways of ADH genes in the antimalarial plant Artemisia annua are still unclear. This study identified 49 ADH genes in A. annua and conducted a detailed analysis of their structural features, conserved motifs, and duplication types, revealing that tandem and dispersed duplications are the primary mechanisms of gene expansion. Evolutionary analysis of ADH genes between A. annua (AanADH) and A. argyi (AarADH) revealed dynamic changes, with 35 genes identified deriving from their most recent common ancestor in both species. ADH1, crucial for artemisinin production, had two copies in both species, expanding via dispersed duplication in A. annua but whole-genome duplication in A. argyi. CREs and WGCNA analysis suggested that AanADH genes may be regulated by UV-B stress. Following short-term UV-B treatment, 16 DEGs were identified, including ADH1 (AanADH6 and AanADH7), and these genes were significantly downregulated after two hours treatment (UV2h) and upregulated after four hours treatment (UV4h). The expression changes of these genes were further confirmed by GO enrichment analysis and qRT-PCR experiments. Overall, this study comprehensively characterized the ADH gene family in A. annua and systematically identified AanADH genes that were responsive to UV-B stress, providing a foundation for further research on their roles in abiotic stress responses."

      "abstract": "The destructive bacterial wilt disease caused by Ralstonia solanacearum leads to substantial losses in pepper production worldwide. Plant-derived pesticides exhibit advantages of high efficiency and broad spectrum when compared to traditional chemical pesticides. Artemisia annua and 'Tai Jiao' No. 1 were used as the experimental materials, and treated with 0.75 g·mL-1, 1.5 g·mL-1, and 3 g·mL-1 of A. annua extract and inoculated with R. solanacearum at a concentration of OD600 = 0.1 for 14 days. The inhibitory activity of A. annua extracts against R. solanacearum, as well as the disease index, defense enzyme activities, and defense-related substances contents of pepper seedlings were determined. The results showed that the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the A. annua extract was 3 g·mL-1. As the concentration of A. annua extract increased, the extent of R. solanacearum cell crumpling intensified, accompanied by a gradual decline in its biofilm-forming ability. On the 14th day after treatment, the disease severity index and incidence rate were significantly reduced when the A. annua extract was applied at concentrations of 0.75 g·mL-1 and 3 g·mL-1. At both the 7th and 14th days after treatment, the application of A. annua extract at concentrations of 0.75 g·mL-1 and 3 g·mL-1 led to enhanced activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) in peppers at different stages. Simultaneously, it reduced the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), effectively scavenging reactive oxygen species and alleviating cellular lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, the extract increased the activities of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), as well as elevated the contents of soluble protein, flavonoids, and total phenols, ultimately enhancing the disease resistance of peppers. Considering the development costs, the application of A. annua extract at a concentration of 0.75 g·mL-1 demonstrates great potential for green control measures against bacterial wilt in peppers."

      "abstract": "Inflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA). The objective of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective properties of Artemisia annua L. water extract (AWE) following the induction of inflammation in cartilage cells (SW1353 cell) through the administration of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β). We demonstrated significant antioxidant activity, as evidenced by elevated total phenolic and flavonoid content, in addition to robust free radical scavenging capacity, as assessed through DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) assays. Its cytotoxic effects were assessed at a concentration of 200 μg/mL, where no cytotoxic signs were observed in SW1353 cells treated with IL-1β; the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were notably reduced in a dose-dependent manner. The principal inflammatory markers, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), were significantly diminished by AWE treatment. AWE administration led to a dose-dependent reduction in the expression of key proteins involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell (NF-κB) signaling pathways, ultimately resulting in a decrease in the release of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), specifically MMP-1 and MMP-13, which are known to contribute to cartilage degradation. Additionally, the levels of degraded collagen type II in the cartilage cells were restored. These findings suggest that reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, along with inhibiting activated MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways, may ameliorate the progression of IL-1β-induced OA. Furthermore, a molecular docking analysis revealed a strong binding affinity of MMP-13, a critical mediator in the pathogenesis of OA. Six compounds were identified in AWE, corroborating its potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, AWE may serve as a potentially useful therapeutic agent against OA by modulating inflammation-related mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Artemisia annua L., also referred to as sweet wormwood, sweet annie, sweet sagewort, and annual wormwood (Chinese: qngho), is a species of wormwood native to temperate Asia but naturalised worldwide. It is a member of the Asteraceae family. At the moment, Artemisia annua is the sources of artemisinin and semisynthetic artemisinin derivatives (including dihydroartemisinin, artesunate, artemether, and arteether) used in the development of malaria combination treatments (ACTs = Artemisinin-based combination therapy). Animal experiments have shown that similar chemicals can prevent tumor development and metastasis. Furthermore, there is no conclusive proof from human trials that the benefits seen in animal research extend to cancer patients. Experiences with malaria treatment indicate that artemisinin-based medicines are generally well-tolerated. This study highlights A. annua's traditional use and contemporary pharmacological research, bringing unique insights into the usage of A. annua in the treating a wide range of ailments."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to observe and assess the efficacy and safety of Artemisia annua (A. annua)-sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) in patients with mild-moderate allergic asthma (AS). METHODS: In this retrospective study, the complete data of 60 patients with mild-moderate AS from October 2022 to October 2023 were included. Patients were stratified into two different groups based on treatment regimens: the SLIT group, 30 individuals who underwent standardized A. annua-SLIT for at least 6 months before pollen season, and the control group, the other 30 patients only received the symptomatic drug. During the 2022 and 2023 pollen season, asthma daytime symptom score (ADSS), asthma nighttime symptom score (ANSS), total medicine score (TMS), asthma control test score (ACT), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), and FEV1/forced vital capacity were measured to evaluate the efficacy, and adverse events (AEs) were used to assess its safety. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in all clinical outcomes between the two groups during the 2022 pollen season (all p > 0.05). However, after SLIT treatment, the level of ADSS, ANSS, TMS, ACT, FEV1, and patients' number of well-controlled AS significantly improved compared with the control group (all p < 0.01). Notably, all the clinical outcomes significantly improved compared with the baseline only in the SLIT group (all p < 0.001). No severe AEs were reported, and all AEs were mild. CONCLUSION: Pre-seasonal treatment of A. annua-SLIT for at least 6 months could relieve daytime and nighttime symptoms, reduce medication use, and improve asthma control and lung function in mono- and polysensitized patients with mild-moderate AS."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) usually seek treatment when symptoms become unbearable during the pollen season. It remains unclear whether initiating sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) during the pollen season affects patients' safety. This study aims to compare the tolerability of initiating Artemisia annua SLIT during the pollen season versus before the season. METHODS: Ninety patients with Artemisia-induced SAR were recruited and equally randomized into the coseasonal initiation treatment (COS-SLIT) group and the preseasonal initiation treatment (PRE-SLIT) group. The COS-SLIT group started SLIT when allergic symptoms occurred during the 2022 pollen season, while the PRE-SLIT group began SLIT four months before the expected season in 2022. Patients were categorized as mild symptoms or moderate-severe symptoms group based on the level of visual analog scale (VAS) scores evaluated during the 2021 pollen season. The incidence, frequency, performance, and alleviating measures of adverse events (AEs) were analyzed after the up-dosing phase (5 weeks), at three months (13 weeks), six months (26 weeks), and twelve months (52 weeks). RESULTS: A total of 72 patients (32 patients in the COS-SLIT group and 40 patients in the PRE-SLIT) were included in the analysis. Among these patients, 33 reported a total of 78 AEs. No significant difference was found in the frequency and number of patients experiencing AEs between the COS-SLIT and PRE-SLIT groups during the four follow-up periods (all p > 0.05). There were no significant differences in the symptoms or alleviating measures of AEs between the two groups in general (all p > 0.05). Furthermore, the most common AEs in the COS-SLIT group were nasal symptoms (n = 14), lip edema (n = 10), and cough (n = 4), while in the PRE-SLIT group were nasal symptoms (n = 12), lip edema (n = 8), and ocular pruritus (n = 6). Symptomatic drugs were the most common alleviating measures in both groups (61.29% in COS-SLIT and 64.52% in PRE-SLIT, p > 0.05). Patients with mild and moderate-severe symptoms showed comparable tolerability at different initiation timing (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: This prospective study demonstrates the comparable safety and tolerability of initiating Artemisia annua SLIT during the pollen season and before the season.",

      "abstract": "In Cameroon, like in other African countries, infusions of Artemisia afra and Artemisia annua are widely used for the management of health-related problems, including malaria. The secondary metabolite contents of medicinal plants vary between different geographical regions and seasons, directly influencing their effectiveness in treating ailments. This study explores the phytochemical diversity and anti-plasmodial potential of A. annua and A. afra from distinct geographical locations within Cameroon, aiming to define the optimal chemical composition in terms of anti-plasmodial activity. Extracts were prepared from plants collected from diverse regions in Cameroon during both the rainy and dry seasons, and their metabolic contents were analyzed using Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC), High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), and Gas Chromatography (GC). Their anti-plasmodial potential was assessed on a chloroquine-sensitive 3D7 Plasmodium falciparum strain. Additionally, the environmental parameters of the collecting sites were retrieved from multispectral satellite imagery. The activity profiles of the samples were associated with their environment, with distinct phytochemical compositions observed for each sample based on its geographical origin and season. Traces of artemisinin were detected in some of the A. afra samples, but it was present in the A. annua samples at a significantly higher concentration, especially in the rainy season samples (highest concentration in the Adamawa region, at 8.9% m/m artemisinin in the dry extract). Both plants are active at different levels, with A. annua more active due to the presence of artemisinin and A. afra probably active due to the presence of polyphenols. Both season and geographical location influence both plants' metabolic contents and hence their antimalaria activity. These findings suggest that the selection of a suitable Artemisia sample for use as a potential antimalarial treatment should take into consideration its geographical origin and the period of collection.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coccidia are among the primary pathogens causing diarrhea and even fatalities in lambs. With the increasing use of chemical drugs to treat coccidiosis, the problem of drug resistance is becoming more and more threatening. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify novel alternative drugs for the treatment of the lamb coccidia. In this study, the effect of different doses and extraction methods of Artemisia annua (A. annua) on anticoccidial activity and growth performance was assessed by oocysts output (OPG), fecal index, average daily gain (ADG) and the new production value of experimental lambs. High-throughput sequencing technology was employed to investigate the effect of A. annua on the intestinal microbiota and metabolites of lambs afflicted with coccidiosis. RESULTS: The results revealed that all A. annua treatment groups exhibited good anticoccidial effects. According to the soft stool index and ADG analysis, the Low-dose A. annua (AL) and A. annua alcohol extract (AA) groups demonstrated a better overall effect. The microbiota and metabolites of lambs changed after A. annua was administered. Unclassified_Muribaculaceae exhibited a significant positive correlation with ADG (P < 0.05) and a negative correlation with OPG, although the latter was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Alistipes displayed a significant negative correlation with ADG (P < 0.05), and a positive correlation with OPG (P > 0.05). Additionally, UCG 005 exhibited a highly significant negative correlation with OPG (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The above results demonstrated that AL and AA groups had more effective anticoccidial action. Unclassified_Muribaculaceae could be employed as a suitable probiotic to enhance weight gain in lambs, while UCG-005 could inhibit intestinal Eimeria colonization in lambs. Alistipes may serve as a biomarker for predicting the risk of intestinal coccidia outbreaks in lambs. A. annua induced significant changes in gut microbiota, accompanied by corresponding changes in metabolites. These differences in gut microbiota and metabolites provide valuable insights for subsequent research on the mechanisms underlying anticoccidial action.",

Artemisia annua (A. annua), known for its extensive pharmacological properties, has shown potential in cancer therapy. This study investigates the chemopreventive efficacy of methanolic extract of A. annua (MEA) in an azoxymethane (AOM)-induced murine model of CRC, with a focus on its antioxidant, biomarker modulation, and pro-apoptotic activities. Methods: MEA was obtained via cold solvent extraction, yielding 39%, and demonstrated potent in vitro cytotoxicity against HCT116 and RKO colon cancer cell lines, with IC50 values of 20 µg/mL and 15 µg/mL, respectively. Swiss albino mice were treated with MEA beginning two weeks before AOM induction, with treatment continuing for 21 weeks. Survival was monitored for 40 weeks. Key outcomes included serum biomarker levels (ADA, GGT, CD73, LDH), antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, CAT, GPx1, MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS) modulation, apoptosis induction, and histopathological evaluation. Results: MEA significantly improved survival rates, reduced AOM-induced weight loss, and modulated cancer biomarkers, with marked reductions in ADA, GGT, CD73, and LDH levels. Antioxidant defenses were restored, as evidenced by increased SOD, CAT, and GPx1 activities and decreased MDA levels. ROS levels were significantly reduced, and apoptosis in colonic cells was effectively induced. Histopathological analysis revealed substantial mitigation of CRC-associated morphological abnormalities. Conclusions: MEA exhibits robust chemopreventive properties, demonstrating its potential to reduce oxidative stress, modulate key biomarkers, and induce apoptosis in CRC. These findings position MEA as a promising natural candidate for CRC prevention and therapy, warranting further exploration for clinical application."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sheep coccidiosis could disturb the balance of intestinal microbiota, causing diarrhea, and even death in lambs. Chemical drugs are the primary method of treating sheep coccidiosis, but their use will bring drug resistance, toxic side effects, drug residues, and other problems. Chinese herbal medicines are investigated as alternative methods for controlling coccidian infections. METHODS: In this study, the effect of fermented Artemisia annua (FA) on oocysts per gram (OPG), average daily gain (ADG), and expression of inflammatory factors were investigated in lambs that were naturally infected with coccidia. RESULTS: The results showed that the FA had similar anti-coccidiosis effect to the original drug, while the FA demonstrated a more significant effect on weight gain, and a better ability to reduce the inflammatory response compared to the unfermented drug during the treatment period (P < 0.05). Furthermore, High-throughput sequencing technology was used to study the effects of FA on intestinal microbiota, and fecal metabolites of naturally infected lambs. The species richness of intestinal microbiota of lambs was significantly improved by FA. The abundance of bacteria unclassified_Muribaculaceae, and UCG_005 were increased by fermentation of A. annua. The abundance of bacteria Escherichia_Shigella, unclassified_Clostridia_UCG_014, and Alistipes was reduced. The prevention, and treatment of coccidiosis by fermentation of A. annua may also be related to a series of metabolites affected by intestinal microbiota, including artemisinin, Lysyl-Proline, and TRP-tyrosine. CONCLUSION: FA was found to have superior anti-coccidiosis, anti-inflammatory, and weight gain effects compared to the original Artemisia annua. Intestinal microbes and metabolites such as unclassified_Muribaculaceae, UCG-005, and Artemisinin were identified, suggesting their potential significance. Alistipes was proposed as a biomarker for predicting intestinal coccidia outbreak risk in lambs, pending further validation. The correlation between microbiota, and metabolites may provide new insights into pathogenic changes associated with Eimeria spp.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Artemisia spp. have been used for millennia in traditional medicine to treat a variety of ailments, including malaria. Extracts of Artemisia afra and A. annua remain widely used throughout Africa for healthcare purposes, notably to prevent and/or treat malaria. However, the modes of action of these plant extracts remain unclear, with contradictory reports regarding the presence and role of artemisinin in both plants. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to identify differences in the antimalarial mode of action of A. afra and A. annua by measuring their phenolic profiles and comparing their effect on parasite metabolism in vitro. METHODS: In this work, we analyzed the phenolic profile of A. afra and A. annua extracts through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), detected and quantified artemisinin through HPLC and mass spectrometry (MS), and performed comparative HPLC-MS metabolomic analysis on in vitro-cultured Plasmodium falciparum trophozoites to elucidate the potential modes of action of these plant extracts. RESULTS: A. afra contained only trace amounts of artemisinin and elicited a different parasite metabolic response compared to A. annua, which contained significantly more artemisinin and correlated closely with the parasite response profile elicited by purified artemisinin. A. annua impacted parasite glutathione metabolism in agreement with the established redox activity of artemisinin, while A. afra had an effect on lipid precursors. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that A. afra and A. annua have divergent effects on Plasmodium falciparum metabolism and provides support for ongoing efforts exploring the use of A. afra for the treatment of malaria.",

METHODS: A total of 50 patients (aged 4-60 years) with ARC who visited hospital from July to September 2022 were enrolled and randomly divided into the SLIT (n = 25) and control group (n = 25). Patients in SLIT group received Artemisia annua SLIT and patients in control group only received symptomatic medication. The study continued for 1 year. Four nasal symptom scores, two eye symptom scores, and medication usage of the patients during 2021 (baseline) and 2023 pollen seasons were recorded, as well as adverse events (AEs) during the study. RESULTS: Finally, 20 patients of SLIT group and 22 patients of control group completed this study. Compared with the baseline, the levels of total rhinoconjunctivitis symptom score (TRSS), total medication score (TMS), and combined symptom and medication score for rhinoconjunctivitis (CSMS-RC) experienced significant reductions after 1 year SLIT. Additionally, these outcomes also decreased significantly in SLIT group when compared with the control group during 2023 pollen season. Especially, there were more patients showed symptoms reduction, medication use decrease, and efficacy improvement in the SLIT group. Notably, no severe AEs were observed throughout the treatment course among patients receiving SLIT. CONCLUSIONS: Coseasonal initiating Artemisia annua SLIT demonstrated clinical efficacy and safety for children and adult patients with ARC.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Malaria continues to be among the leading causes of mortality in Africa including Uganda, with the emergence of parasite resistance to the first-line therapeutics (Artemisinin- based Combination Therapy). To find new therapeutics, this study has reported an in vivo antimalarial efficacy of combinations of Artemisia annua (Aa), Vernonia amygdalina (Va), and Microglossa pyrifolia (Mp) in mice model using factorial design. METHODS: The Aa and Va were extracted by hot infusion, and Mp by cold maceration using distilled water. The dry extracts were screened for different phytochemicals, and later subjected to in vivo antimalarial activity using Peter's 4-day suppressive test. The 23 factorial design used Aa, Va, and Mp aqueous extracts as independent variables at two levels (-1 and 1), and the percentage chemo suppression and survival time as response variables. The data was analyzed using Design Expert 13 and GraphPad Prism employing ANOVA linear regression modelling and t-test respectively. RESULTS: All the extracts had alkaloids, phenols, saponins, terpenoids, cardiac glycosides, tannins, steroids, and carbohydrates. The various combinations showed chemo suppression from 41.5 to 91.0% and survival time of 19 to 23 days. The first three combinations having lower levels of Aa (200 mg/kg) exhibited higher chemo suppression (> 90%) compared to Artemisinin-Lumefantrine positive control at 4 mg/kg with 87.5%. Lower levels of Aa in the combinations contributed to high chemo suppression while higher levels of Va prolonged survival times. Interactions between Aa and Mp showed higher chemo suppression, and that between Aa and Va increased survival time. An optimized prediction of 94.4% chemo suppression was made by the ANOVA model at lower levels of Aa and Va, and a higher level of Mp, which is similar to an experimental run which gave a response of 90. 6%. CONCLUSION: An optimum combination of the three plants as a natural herbal antimalarial therapy was obtained using factorial design, and it offers an alternative to first line Artemisinin based Combination Therapy (ACTs) as parasite resistance looms. This combination could be further developed into a standard phytopharmaceutical and subjected to Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs).",

(WEAA) on rumen immune and antioxidative indexes, fermentation parameters and microbial diversity in lambs. A total of 32 3-month-old Dorper × Han female lambs having comparable body weights (24±0.09 kg) were selected and were randomly assigned to four treatments, with eight repetitions for each treatment. The basal diet, consisting of 45% concentrate and 55% forage, was solely provided to the control group. For the other treatment groups, the basal diet was supplemented with WEAA at dosages of 500, 1000, and 1500 mg/kg diet, respectively. Rumen tissue samples were collected for the analysis of immune and antioxidative parameters, as well as related gene expression. Rumen fluid samples were collected to assess rumen fermentation parameters on days 30 and 60 and to evaluate the microbiota on day 60. Results showed that WEAA supplementation linearly or quadratically increased the content of sIgA, IL-4, IL-2 and the gene expression level of MyD88, IκB-α, IL-4, COX-2, iNOS in rumen tissue (p < 0.05), as well as the bacteria negatively associated with IL-6 (g_ [Eubacterium] _cellulosolvens_group). Furthermore, the addition of WEAA linearly or quadratically increased rumen T-SOD, GSH-Px (p < 0.05) and the gene expression level of Nrf2, SOD2, GSH-Px, HO-1 (p < 0.05), and decreased the rumen concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) and gene expression level of Keap1 (p < 0.05), as well as the bacteria positively associated with T-AOC, T-SOD and GSH-Px (g_Lachnospiraceae_NK3A20_group, g_Saccharofermentans, g__Marvinbryantia, g_unclassified_f_Eggerthellaceae). The supplementation of WEAA caused the concentration of microprotein (MCP), total volatile fatty acids (TVFA), propionate to increase either linearly or quadratically, while reducing the concentration of NH3-N and the acetate/propionate ratio (A:P) in rumen fluid (p < 0.05). The addition of WEAA linearly or quadratically increased the abundance of Actinobacteriota, Cyanobacteria and Lachnospiraceae_NK3A20_group (p < 0.10), and g__Lachnospiraceae_NK3A20_group, g_Saccharofermentans, g_Marvinbryantia, g_Bifidobacterium were significantly abundant as specific microflora in the 1000 mg/kg WEAA supplementation group. In conclusion, dietary inclusion of 1000 mg/kg WEAA improved the rumen immune function, antioxidant status, rumen fermentation, and composition of rumen microbes in lambs."

      "abstract": "Artemisinin-based combinational therapies (ACTs) constitute the first line of malaria treatment. However, due to its trichome-specific biosynthesis, low concentration, and poor understanding of regulatory mechanisms involved in artemisinin biosynthesis and trichome development, it becomes very difficult to meet the increased demand for ACTs. Here, we have reported that a bHLH transcription factor, AaMYC2-type, plays an important role in regulating GST development and artemisinin biosynthesis in Artemisia annua. AaMYC2-type encodes a protein that is transcriptionally active and localised to the nucleus. It is prominently expressed in aerial parts like leaves, stems, inflorescence and least expressed in roots. AaMYC2-type expression is significantly increased under different hormonal treatments. In transgenic overexpression lines, AaMYC2-type OE, a significant increase in the expression of trichome development and artemisinin biosynthesis genes was observed. While in knockdown lines, Aamyc2-type, expression of trichome development and artemisinin biosynthesis genes were significantly reduced. Yeast one-hybrid assay clearly shows that the AaMYC2-type directly binds to the E-boxes in the promoter regions of ADS and CYP71AVI. The SEM microscopy depicted the number of trichomes elevated from 11 mm-2 in AaMYC2-type OE lines to 6.1 mm-2 in Aamyc2-type. The final effect of the alteration in biosynthetic and trichome developmental genes was observed in the accumulation of artemisinin. In the AaMYC2-type OE, the artemisinin content was 12 mg g-1DW, which was reduced to 3.2 mg g-1DW in the Aamyc2-type. Altogether, the above findings suggest that the AaMYC2-type play a dual regulating role in controlling both trichome developmental and artemisinin biosynthetic genes.",

Artemisinin, a key antimalarial compound from Artemisia annua, is crucial for treatment, but low natural yields hinder large-scale production. In this study, we employed advanced transgenic technology to co-overexpress six key biosynthetic enzymes-Isopentenyl Diphosphate Isomerase (IDI), Farnesyl Pyrophosphate Synthase (FPS), Amorpha 4,11-diene Synthase (ADS), cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP71AV1), cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (AACPR) and artemisinic aldehyde D11 reductase (DBR2)-in A. annua to significantly enhance artemisinin production. Our innovative approach utilized a co-expression strategy to optimize the artemisinin biosynthetic pathway, leading to a remarkable up to 200 % increase in artemisinin content in T1 transgenic plants compared to non-transgenic controls. The stability and efficacy of this transformation were confirmed in subsequent generations (T2), achieving a potential 232 % increase in artemisinin levels. Additionally, we optimized transgene expression to maintain plant growth and development, and performed untargeted metabolite analysis using GC-MS, which revealed significant changes in metabolite composition among T2 lines, indicating effective diversion of farnesyl diphosphate into the artemisinin pathway. This metabolic engineering breakthrough offers a promising and scalable solution for enhancing artemisinin production, representing a major advancement in the field of plant biotechnology and a potential strategy for more cost-effective malaria treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Transcription factors (TFs) of plant-specific SHORT INTERNODES (SHI) family play a significant role in regulating development and metabolism in plants. In Artemisia annua, various TFs from different families have been discovered to regulate the accumulation of artemisinin. However, specific members of the SHI family in A. annua (AaSHIs) have not been identified to regulate the biosynthesis of artemisinin. RESULTS: We found five AaSHI genes (AaSHI1 to AaSHI5) in the A. annua genome. The expression levels of AaSHI1, AaSHI2, AaSHI3 and AaSHI4 genes were higher in trichomes and young leaves, also induced by light and decreased when the plants were subjected to dark treatment. The expression pattern of these four AaSHI genes was consistent with the expression pattern of four structural genes of artemisinin biosynthesis and their specific regulatory factors. Dual-luciferase reporter assays, yeast one-hybrid assays, and transient transformation in A. annua provided the evidence that AaSHI1 could directly bind to the promoters of structural genes AaADS and AaCYP71AV1, and positively regulate their expressions. This study has presented candidate genes, with AaSHI1 in particular, that can be considered for the metabolic engineering of artemisinin biosynthesis in A. annua. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, a genome-wide analysis of the AaSHI TF family of A. annua was conducted. Five AaSHIs were identified in A. annua genome. Among the identified AaSHIs, AaSHI1 was found to be localized to the nucleus and activate the expression of structural genes of artemisinin biosynthesis including AaADS and AaCYP71AV1. These results indicated that AaSHI1 had positive roles in modulating artemisinin biosynthesis, providing candidate genes for obtaining high-quality new A. annua germplasms.",

This study aimed to assess the impact of varying AA concentrations on broiler chicken growth, gene expression, and profitability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred 1-day-old male Cobb chicks were randomly allocated into four treatment groups, each containing five replicates and 10 birds. The experimental groups consisted of G1 (basal diet), G2 (basal diet with 0.3% AA), G3 (basal diet with 0.6% AA), and G4 (basal diet with 0.9% AA). The birds had continuous access to feed and water throughout the study. The experiment lasted for 42 days. We measured the growth performance (Feed intake, Life weight), carcass traits (weight after slaughter, dressed carcass, heart, gizzard, spleen, giblet and thymus weight), liver and spleen antioxidants (CAT, GSH, SOD), and gene expression of anti-inflammatory and immune- related genes. RESULTS: The primary findings revealed that the addition of 0.6% AA had a positive impact (p < 0.05) on all investigated variables compared with the control and other groups. Dietary supplementation with 0.6% AA led to increased breast, giblet, skeleton, and total yield, and net return compared with the control group. Supplementation with AA exhibited antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunological effects through improved levels of antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in tissue homogenates of the liver and spleen. It also upregulated the relative messenger RNA levels of anti-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-10, SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px, whereas IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were downregulated. CONCLUSION: The study found that AA is a promising replacement for antibiotics in poultry farming as a growth promoter for chickens. 0.6% AA in the broiler diet yielded the best results, striking a balance between superior performance and robust economic benefits."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Artemisinin and its derivatives, the well-known anti-malarial drugs extracted from traditional Chinese medicine, Artemisia annua, have been implicated in treating fibrotic diseases. However, whether artemisinin affects cardiac fibrosis in the pathogenesis of heart failure is still unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the possible effects of artemisinin on cardiac function and myocardial fibrosis in the heart failure model and to explore the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Isoproterenol was injected subcutaneously for induction of the cardiac fibrosis model. Proteomic analysis was performed after 4 four weeks of artemisinin treatment. Echocardiography was used to evaluate cardiac function and structure. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, as well as Masson trichrome staining, were performed for histopathology. The α-SMA, collagen I, and III expression in the myocardium was detected by immunohistochemical staining. The ratio of heart weight to body weight (HW/BW, mg/kg) and the ratio of heart weight to tibia length (HW/TL, mg/mm) were calculated as indicators for cardiac remodeling. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels were quantified in rat plasma using enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In contrast, the protein levels of TGF-β1, p-Smad2/3, and Smad2/3 were assessed in the myocardium and fibroblasts via western blot analysis. RT-qPCR was performed to analysis the expression of Col-I, Col-III, α-SMA, NLRP3, Caspase-1, IL-1β, and IL-18. RESULTS: Proteomic analysis identified 227 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), including 119 upregulated and 108 downregulated proteins. These proteins were identified as the core proteins targeted by artemisinin for improving myocardial remodeling. GO annotation of the DEPs indicated that the DEPs were mainly associated with biological processes such as inflammation regulation. In the in vivo study of an isoproterenol-induced rat cardiac remodeling model, we found that artemisinin administration significantly ameliorated cardiac dysfunction and reduced collagen production by suppressing TGFβ-1/Smads signaling and inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation. As manifested by downregulating the expression of α-SMA, Col-I, and Col-III, NLRP3, IL-1β, IL-18, Caspase-1 mRNA, and TGF-β1, p-SMAD 2/3 protein in the myocardium. Similar beneficial effects of artemisinin were consistently observed in TGF-β1 treated primary cardiac fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: Extracts from Artemisia annua relieves myocardial remodeling through TGF-β1/Smad2/3 pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Volatile oil is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine owing to its unique hydrophobic and lipophilic properties and rapid skin absorption. Artemisia annua L. (A.annua) essential oil (AAEO), a volatile oil extracted from A. annua, exhibits anti-inflammatory properties. However, few studies have investigated its effects on skin inflammation. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate and elucidate the mechanisms of action of AAEO in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Network pharmacology was used to predict the targets and pathways of AAEO for the treatment of AD. The AD mouse model was established by topical application of 2,4-dintrochlorobenzene (DNCB), AAEO, and the positive control drug hydrocortisone butyrate cream (HBC). We evaluated the symptoms of AD, SCORAD scores, histological analysis, and serum IgE and TNF-α levels in mice. Immunofluorescence, western blotting, and qPCR were used to investigate the signaling pathways. RESULTS: Network pharmacology analysis indicated that AAEO may exert its effects via the MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway. Animal experiments demonstrated that topical application of AAEO and HBC significantly ameliorated skin lesions, reduced dermatitis score, and decreased spleen weight compared to DNCB treatment. AAEO reduced skin epidermal thickness and mast cell infiltration. DNCB markedly reduced the protein levels of filaggrin (FLG) and loricrin (LOR), whereas AAEO reversed these changes. Notably, the 5% concentration of AAEO demonstrated substantial improvement in skin barrier function. Compared to the DNCB group, the levels of FLG and LOR remained almost unchanged following HBC treatment. DNCB markedly elevated IgE and TNF-α levels, which were reversed by AAEO and HBC treatment. Among the inflammatory cytokines, DNCB increased mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, however, it reduced IL-10, with AAEO and HBC reversing these changes to various degrees. Additionally, DNCB-induced ERK, JNK, and P38 phosphorylation, associated with the upregulation of phosphorylation of NF-κB, whereas, AAEO and HBC exhibited potent inhibition of the MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: This study systematically demonstrated the possible therapeutic effects and mechanisms of AAEO in AD via network pharmacological analysis and experimental confirmation. These results revealed that topical application of AAEO can suppress skin inflammation and restore skin barrier function. These findings provide the potential application of AAEO in synthesizing external preparations for both pharmacological and cosmetic industries.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coccidiosis outbreaks in susceptible laying hens can significantly decrease egg production and cause substantial economic loss to the egg industry. The supplementation of poultry diets with chemotherapeutic agents is limited due to antimicrobial resistance and residue in poultry meat or processed products. Therefore, alternative strategies to control coccidiosis are needed, and Artemisia annua (AA) might have the potential to be a phytogenic feed additive, an alternative to anticoccidial agents. This study aimed to investigate the effect of the dietary supplementation of powdered AA on the performance and gut health of laying hens infected with coccidiosis by Eimeria spp. METHODS: A total of 225 Hy-Line W-36 laying hens at 23 weeks of age were allocated into 5 treatment groups: 1) control (NC), 2) pair-fed (PF) control, 3) challenged control (CC), 4) CC with dietary inclusion of 0.5% AA (0.5AA), and v) CC with dietary inclusion of 1% AA (1AA). The hens in the CC, 0.5AA, and 1AA groups were orally inoculated with sporulated oocysts of Eimeria maxima (12,500), Eimeria tenella (12,500), and Eimeria acervulina (62,500) at week 25. The PF hens received the same amount of feed consumed by the CC hens from 0-14 days post-inoculation (dpi) of Eimeria spp. The performance of the laying hens, including body weight (BW), hen-day egg production (HDEP), feed intake (FI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR), was measured weekly. Additionally, markers of intestinal health, including gut permeability, lesion score, intestinal morphometry, and immune responses, were evaluated at 6, 14, and 21 dpi. RESULTS: At 6 and 14 dpi, laying hens challenged with Eimeria spp. had a lower BW than PF and NC hens (p < 0.0001). Supplementation of 1% AA improved the HDEP by 8.1% compared to CC hens; however, it was still 15.4% lower than that of PF hens (p < 0.0001). The inclusion of 1% AA did not have any beneficial effect on FI; however, the FCR was improved by 0.61 (2.46) than that of CC hens (3.07; p < 0.0001). The inclusion of 1% AA reduced the severity of the intestinal lesions and increased the recovery of intestinal villi (p < 0.05). Additionally, gut permeability was significantly different between the challenged and non-challenged hens; however, among the challenged hens, the inclusion of AA reduced the gut permeability by 29% compared to CC hens (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, the inclusion of 0.5% AA reduced the inflammatory responses in the infected hens. CONCLUSION: Dietary inclusion of AA partially restored the performance and gut health of the laying hens and modulated their inflammatory immune response following Eimeria infection; however, further studies are needed to better understand the mode of action and effective dosages to improve the gut health without negative impacts on the performance."

      "abstract": "With the high intensification of poultry breeding, a series of diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria threaten the health of poultry and human. Among them, poultry diseases induced by Escherichia coli cause significant economic loss every year. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation with Artemisia annua L. polysaccharide (AAP) on the growth performance and intestinal barrier function of broilers with Escherichia coli (E. coli) challenge. A total of 256 one-day-old chicks were randomly assigned to four treatment groups: control group (fed basal diet), AAP group (fed basal diet supplemented with AAP), E. coli group (fed basal diet and orally administered E. coli), AAP + E. coli group (fed basal diet supplemented with AAP and orally administered E. coli). Dietary AAP supplementation elevated the BW, ADG and ADFI in non-challenged broilers. AAP also increased the apparent metabolic rate of EE and Ca in E. coli-challenged broilers. Moreover, AAP not only enhanced the serum IgA content but also decreased the serum and jejunum content of IL-6, as well as the jejunum level of IL-1β in non-challenged broilers. AAP also down-regulates the mRNA level of inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) by inhibiting the mRNA expression of TLR4 and MyD88 in intestinal NF-κB signaling pathway of E. coli-challenged broilers. Meanwhile, AAP up-regulates the activity and mRNA level CAT by down-regulating the mRNA level of Keap1 in intestinal Nrf2 signaling pathway of E. coli-challenged broilers, and decreased serum MDA concentration. AAP significantly elevated the mRNA level of CAT, SOD and Nrf2 in jejunal of non-challenged broilers. Interestingly, AAP can improve intestinal physical barrier by down-regulating serum ET content, increasing the jejunal villus height/crypt depth (VH/CD) and ZO-1 mRNA level in broilers challenged by E. coli. AAP also elevated the VH/CD and the mRNA level of Occludin, ZO-1, Mucin-2 in non-challenged broilers. Importantly, AAP reshaped the balance of jejunum microbiota in E. coli-challenged broilers by altering α diversity and community composition. In summary, AAP ameliorated the loss of growth performance in broilers challenged with E. coli, probably by regulating the intestinal permeability and mucosa morphology, immune function, antioxidant ability, and microbiota."

      "abstract": "Artemisinin is the leading medication for the treatment of malaria and is only produced naturally in Artemisia annua. The localization of artemisinin in both the glandular and non-glandular trichomes of the plant makes it an ideal candidate for mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) as a model system for method development. Infrared matrix-assisted laser desorption electrospray ionization MSI (IR-MALDESI-MSI) has the capability to detect hundreds to thousands of analytes simultaneously, providing abundance information in conjunction with species localization throughout a sample. The development of several new optical trains and their application to the IR-MALDESI-MSI platform has improved data quality in previous proof-of-concept experiments but has not yet been applied to analysis of native biological samples, especially the MSI analysis of plants. This study aimed to develop a workflow and optimize MSI parameters, specifically the laser optical train, for the analysis of Artemisia annua with the NextGen IR-MALDESI platform coupled to an Orbitrap Exploris 240 mass spectrometer. Two laser optics were compared to the conventional set up, of which include a Schwarzschild-like reflective objective and a diffractive optical element (DOE). These optics, respectively, enhance the spatial resolution of imaging experiments or create a square spot shape for top-hat imaging. Ultimately, we incorporated and characterized three different optical trains into our analysis of Artemisia annua to study metabolites in the artemisinin pathway. These improvements in our workflow, resulted in high spatial resolution and improved ion abundance from previous work, which will allow us to address many different questions in plant biology beyond this model system.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Initiation of ART among people living with HIV (PLWH) having a CD4 count ≤ 350cells/µl, produces poor immunological recovery, putting them at a high risk of opportunistic infections. To mitigate this, PLWH on ART in Uganda frequently use herbal remedies like Artemisia annua and Moringa oleifera, but their clinical benefits and potential antiretroviral (ARV) interactions remain unknown. This study examined the impact of A. annua and M. oleifera on CD4 count, viral load, and potential ARV interactions among PLWH on ART at an HIV clinic in Uganda. METHODS: 282 HIV-positive participants on antiretroviral therapy (ART) with a CD4 count ≤ 350cells/µl were randomized in a double-blind clinical trial to receive daily, in addition to their routine standard of care either; 1) A. annua leaf powder, 2) A. annua plus M. oleifera, and 3) routine standard of care only. Change in the CD4 count at 12 months was our primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included changes in viral load, complete blood count, and ARV plasma levels. Participants were followed up for a year and outcomes were measured at baseline, 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: At 12 months of patient follow-up, in addition to standard of care, administration of A. annua + M. oleifera resulted in an absolute mean CD4 increment of 105.06 cells/µl, (p < 0.001), while administration of A. annua plus routine standard of care registered an absolute mean CD4 increment of 60.84 cells/µl, (p = 0.001) compared to the control group. The A. annua plus M. oleifera treatment significantly reduced viral load (p = 0.022) and increased platelet count (p = 0.025) and white blood cell counts (p = 0.003) compared to standard care alone, with no significant difference in ARV plasma levels across the groups. CONCLUSION: A combination of A. annua and M. oleifera leaf powders taken once a day together with the routine standard of care produced a significant increase in CD4 count, WBCs, platelets, and viral load suppression among individuals on ART. A. annua and M. oleifera have potential to offer an affordable alternative remedy for managing HIV infection, particularly in low-resource communities lacking ART access.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Many studies have shown the anti-diabetic effects of medicinal plants. But their molecular mechanism has been less studied. Understanding of these mechanisms can help to better manage the treatment of diabetes by using these plants. So, this research examined the effect of Artemisia annua extract on PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)/AKt (serine/threonine kinase protein B) signaling pathway in liver of high-fat diet (HFD)/Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 2 diabetic mice. METHODS: Groups of mice were control, untreated diabetic mice, diabetic mice treated with various doses (400, 200, 100 mg/kg) of methanolic and aqueous extract of A. annua and metformin for four weeks. Type 2 diabetes was produced by feeding high-fat diet following injection of low dose of STZ. After experiment duration all mice were sacrificed and blood glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), index of insulin sensitivity index (ISI) were detected and liver tissues were isolated for to detect m-RNA expression of PI3K and Akt. RESULTS: Extracts of aqueous and methanolic this plant markedly reduced hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, HOMA-IR and elevated ISI in diabetic group in comparison with un-treated diabetic mice. In addition, they could enhance the expression of AKt and PI3K m-RNA in liver tissues in diabetic mice. CONCLUSIONS: Artemisia annua extract ameliorated insulin resistance and improved insulin action in liver via the high activity of PI3K/AKt signaling pathway. So, it can be a suitable alternative treatment to synthetic antidiabetic drugs to improve insulin action in condition of type 2 diabetes.",

      "abstract": "This experiment aimed to study the effect of 1% Artemisia annua added to the diet on growth performance, antioxidant capacity, immunity and intestinal morphology, and gut microbiota of geese. Seventy-two 35-day-old male geese (Zi goose) with similar body weight were selected and randomly divided into 2 groups. Each treatment group of 36 geese was divided into 6 subgroups, each having 6 male geese. The experiment lasted for 21 d. Control group (CON) was fed a basal diet and the experimental group (AAL) was fed a basal diet + 1% Artemisia annua. BW, ADG, and ADFI of the AAL group increased (p < 0.05) and the FCR decreased (p < 0.05) compared with the CON group. The addition of Artemisia annua to the diet increased catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme activities, increased total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) content in serum and jejunum of geese (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, serum IgA, IgG, IgM, and lysozyme (LZM), increased at different time points in the AAL group compared to the CON group (p < 0.05), and decrease in the content of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) , IL-6 (p < 0.05), but no effect on complement C3 and C4. Morphological observation of the small intestine showed that the jejunal crypt depth was decreased in the AAL group (p < 0.05) while elevating the jejunal villus height/crypt depth (p < 0.05). 16S rRNA sequencing results showed the Artemisia annua increased the diversity of cecum microbiota, increasing the relative abundance of Bacteroides, Fecalibacterium, and Paraprevotella. In conclusion, the addition of 1% Artemisia annua to the diet could improve the growth performance, antioxidant and immune ability of geese, as well as improve the development of the jejunum intestinal tract of geese, and change the structure of the cecum microbiota, which had a positive effect on the growth and development of geese. Artemisia annua can be further developed as a feed additive.",

However, the main components and mechanism of action of A. annua on endometrial carcinoma have not been reported. We used the TCMSP database to identify the active components of A. annua and their corresponding gene targets. We then obtained the gene targets specific to endometrial cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and GeneCards databases. The gene targets common to three databases were selected, and a \"component-target\" network was constructed. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis and ranking of the target proteins identified the key protein PTGS2 network analysis, and ranking of the target proteins identified the key protein PTGS2. We also screened the active components of A. annua and found that quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, isorhamnetin, artemisin, and stigmasterol had the most targets. Molecular docking models were established for these six components with PTGS2, revealing strong binding activity for all of them. Finally, we conducted validation experiments to assess the effects of quercetin, an active component of A. annua, on endometrial cancer cells (HEC-1-A and Ishikawa cells). Our findings demonstrate that quercetin has the potential to inhibit both cell growth and migration, while also suppressing the expression of PTGS2."

In this study, we examined how the anticancer effect of DTX is regulated by polyphenols extracted from Korean Artemisia annua L. (pKAL) in DU145 prostate cancer cells (mutant p53) and HCT116 colorectal cancer cells (wild-type p53). Here, we show that the anticancer effect of DTX was enhanced more significantly by pKAL in HCT116 cells than in DU145 cells via phase-contrast microscopy, CCK-8 assay, Western blot, and flow cytometric analysis of annexin V/propidium iodide-stained cells. Notably, mutant p53 was slightly downregulated by single treatment of pKAL or DTX in DU145 cells, whereas wild-type p53 was significantly upregulated by pKAL or DTX in HCT116 cells. Moreover, the enhanced anticancer effect of DTX by pKAL in HCT116 cells was significantly associated with the suppression of DTX-induced p53 upregulation, increase of DTX-induced phospho-p38, and decrease of DTX-regulated cyclin A, cyclin B1, AKT, caspase-8, PARP1, GM130, NF-κB p65, and LDHA, leading to the increased apoptotic cell death and plasma membrane permeability. Our results suggest that pKAL could effectively improve the anticancer effect of DTX-containing chemotherapy used to treat various cancers expressing wild-type p53."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anomalous activation of NF-κB signaling is associated with many inflammatory disorders, such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and acute lung injury (ALI). NF-κB activation requires the ubiquitination of receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) and NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO). Therefore, inhibition of ubiquitation of RIP1 and NEMO may serve as a potential approach for inhibiting NF-κB activation and alleviating inflammatory disorders. PURPOSE: Here, we identified arteannuin B (ATB), a sesquiterpene lactone found in the traditional Chinese medicine Artemisia annua that is used to treat malaria and inflammatory diseases, as a potent anti-inflammatory compound, and then characterized the putative mechanisms of its anti-inflammatory action. METHODS: Detections of inflammatory mediators and cytokines in LPS- or TNF-α-stimulated murine macrophages using RT-qPCR, ELISA, and western blotting, respectively. Western blotting, CETSA, DARTS, MST, gene knockdown, LC-MS/MS, and molecular docking were used to determine the potential target and molecular mechanism of ATB. The pharmacological effects of ATB were further evaluated in DSS-induced colitis and LPS-induced ALI in vivo. RESULTS: ATB effectively diminished the generation of NO and PGE2 by down-regulating iNOS and COX2 expression, and decreased the mRNA expression and release of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in LPS-exposed RAW264.7 macrophages. The anti-inflammatory effect of ATB was further demonstrated in LPS-treated BMDMs and TNF-α-activated RAW264.7 cells. We further found that ATB obviously inhibited NF-κB activation induced by LPS or TNF-α in vitro. Moreover, compared with ATB, dihydroarteannuin B (DATB) which lost the unsaturated double bond, completely failed to repress LPS-induced NO release and NF-κB activation in vitro. Furthermore, UBE2D3, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, was identified as the functional target of ATB, but not DATB. UBE2D3 knockdown significantly abolished ATB-mediated inhibition on LPS-induced NO production. Mechanistically, ATB could covalently bind to the catalytic cysteine 85 of UBE2D3, thereby inhibiting the function of UBE2D3 and preventing ubiquitination of RIP1 and NEMO. In vivo, ATB treatment exhibited robust protective effects against DSS-induced UC and LPS-induced ALI. CONCLUSION: Our findings first demonstrated that ATB exerted anti-inflammatory functions by repression of NF-κB pathway via covalently binding to UBE2D3, and raised the possibility that ATB could be effective in the treatment of inflammatory diseases and other diseases associated with abnormal NF-κB activation.",

The aim of this study was to elucidate how the anticancer effect of β-Lap is regulated by polyphenols extracted from Korean Artemisia annua L. (pKAL) in parental HCT116 and oxaliplatin-resistant (OxPt-R) HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. Here, we show that the anticancer effect of β-Lap is more enhanced by pKAL in HCT116-OxPt-R cells than in HCT116 cells via a CCK-8 assay, Western blot, and phase-contrast microscopy analysis of hematoxylin-stained cells. This phenomenon was associated with the suppression of OxPt-R-related upregulated proteins including p53 and β-catenin, the downregulation of cell survival proteins including TERT, CD44, and EGFR, and the upregulation of cleaved HSP90, γ-H2AX, and LC3B-I/II. A bioinformatics analysis of 21 proteins regulated by combined treatment of pKAL and β-Lap in HCT116-OxPt-R cells showed that the enhanced anticancer effect of β-Lap by pKAL was related to the inhibition of negative regulation of apoptotic process and the induction of DNA damage through TERT, CD44, and EGFR-mediated multiple signaling networks. Our results suggest that the combination of pKAL and β-Lap could be used as a new therapy with low toxicity to overcome the OxPt-R that occurred in various OxPt-containing cancer treatments.",

Herbal extracts are safe and reliable substitute anticoccidial drugs for chemical feed additives as they do not sequel to drug resistance and tissue remnants. OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to assess the anticoccidial effect of an herbal complex of 3 plants (Artemisia annua, Quercus infectoria, and Allium sativum) in broiler chickens compared to toltrazuril anticoccidial. METHODS: This experiment used one hundred twenty broiler chickens and divided them into four equally numbered groups. All the groups, except group (D), were experimentally infected with mixed Eimeria spp. (E. tenella, E. maxima, E. necatrix and E. brunetti) on day 14. Group (A) was treated with a herbal mixture, containing 75% Quercus infectoria with a minimum of 30% total tannin, 16% Artemisia annua with a minimum of 0.02% artemisinin, and 9% Allium sativum with a minimum of 0.4% total phenol contents. Group (B) was treated with toltrazuril. Group (C) did not have any treatment. Group (D) was healthy all the experiment period as a negative control group. During a 42-day breeding period, the study examined clinical signs, weight gains, feed conversion ratio, lesions scoring, casualties, and the number of oocysts in different bird groups. RESULTS: Group (D) showed the most significant weight gain, indicating the economic damage caused by coccidiosis. The best feed conversion ratio was observed in the unchallenged group, and coccidiosis negatively affected it in other groups. Clinical signs of dysentery, diarrhea, and lethargy were seen post-challenge but improved with treatment. Group (D) showed no losses; others had casualties and coccidiosis lesions. Lesion scores were lowest in the group (D), and the herbal mixture improved performance. The herbal mixture and toltrazuril reduced oocyst counts in feces earlier than the untreated group. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the anticoccidial activity of the mentioned herbal complex recommends its use as an alternative anticoccidial agent to chemotherapeutic drugs for controlling coccidiosis."

Finding preventative agents to thwart DOX-caused injuries is thus imperative. Artemisia annua has numerous biomedical uses. This study aims to investigate the attenuative effect of Artemisia annua leaf extract (AALE) treatment on DOX-induced hepatic toxicity in male rats. A phytochemical screening of AALE was evaluated. Forty male rats were used; G1 was a negative control group, G2 was injected with AALE (150 mg/kg) intraperitoneally (i.p) daily for a month, 4 mg/kg of DOX was given i.p to G3 once a week for a month, and G4 was injected with DOX as G3 and with AALE as G2. Body weight changes and biochemical, molecular, and histopathological investigations were assessed. The results showed that AALE contains promising phytochemical constituents that contribute to several potential biomedical applications. AALE mitigated the hepatotoxicity induced by DOX in rats as evidenced by restoring the alterations in the biochemical parameters, antioxidant gene expression, and hepatic histopathological alterations in rats. Importantly, the impact of AALE against the hepatic deterioration resulting from DOX treatment is through activation of the PI-3K/Akt/Nrf-2 signaling, which in turn induces the antioxidant agents.",

Then 158 intersection targets between AMI and A. annua were obtained using R 4.2.0 software. String database was used to construct the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and 6 core targets (MAPK1, TP53, HSP90AA1, RELA, AKT1, and MYC) were screened. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were performed using the R package. GO enrichment results were mainly related to cell responses to chemical stress and cell membrane microregions. KEGG pathways were mainly involved in lipids, atherosclerosis and fluid shear stress. In addition, molecular docking between A. annua active compounds and core targets showed high binding activity. As for in vivo validation, A. annua extract showed significant effects on improving post-infarction ventricular function, delaying ventricular remodeling, and reducing myocardial fibrosis and apoptosis. This study has revealed the potential components and molecular mechanisms of A. annua in the treatment of AMI. Our work also showed that A. annua has great effect on reducing myocardial fibrosis and scar area after infarction.",

In the current study, the impact of assembled the bacterial communities against the pathogenic fungus to promote Artemisia annua L. growths was investigated. We established a model of bacterium-fungus-plant system. Eight bacterial strains and a fungal pathogen Globisporangium ultimum (Glo) were isolated from wild A. annua roots and leaves, respectively. We assembled the six-bacteria community (C6: Rhizobium pusense, Paracoccus sp., Flavobacterium sp., Brevundimonas sp., Stenotrophomonas sp., and Bacillus sp.) with inhibition, and eight-bacteria community (C8) composing of C6 plus another two bacteria (Brevibacillus nitrificans and Cupriavidus sp.) without inhibition against Glo in individually dual culture assays. Inoculation of seedlings with C8 significantly reduced impact of Glo. The growth and disease suppression of A. annua seedlings inoculated with C8 + Glo were significantly better than those of seedlings inoculated with only Glo. C8 had more inhibitory effects on Glo, and also enhanced the contents of four metabolites in seedling roots compared to Glo treatment only. Additionally, the inhibitory effects of root extracts from A. annua seedlings showed that Glo was most sensitive, the degree of eight bacteria sensitivity were various with different concentrations. Our findings suggested that the non-inhibitory bacteria played a vital role in the bacterial community composition and that some bacterial taxa were associated with disease suppression. The construction of a defined assembled bacterial community could be used as a biological fungicide, promoting biological disease control of plants."

Notably, the increased expression levels of those genes regulated by ABA depended on light. Gene expression analysis found that AaABI5, a transcription factor belonging to the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family, was inducible by the light and ABA treatment. Analysis of AaABI5-overexpressing and -suppressing lines suggested that AaABI5 could enhance artemisinin biosynthesis and activate the expression of four core biosynthetic genes. In addition, the key regulator of light-induced artemisinin biosynthesis, AaHY5, could bind to the promoter of AaABI5 and activate its expression.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Recently, it was shown that many natural extracts have positive effects against cancer, compared with chemotherapy or recent hormonal treatments. A. annua is an annual medicinal herb used in the traditional Chinese medicine. It has also been shown to inhibit the proliferation of various cancer cell lines. METHODS: Multi-level modes of action of A. annua constituents in cancer therapy were investigated using an integrated approach of network pharmacology, molecular docking, dynamic simulations and in-vitro cytotoxicity testing on both healthy and cancer cells. RESULTS: Network pharmacology-based analysis showed that the hit Artemisia annua constituents related to cancer targets were 3-(2-methylpropanoyl)-4-cadinene-3,11-diol, artemisinin G, O-(2-propenal) coniferaldehyde, (2-glyceryl)-O-coniferaldehyde and arteamisinin III, whereas the main cancer allied targets were NFKB1, MAP2K1 and AR. Sixty-eight significant signaling KEGG pathways with p < 0.01 were recognized, the most enriched of which were prostate cancer, breast cancer, melanoma and pancreatic cancer. Thirty-five biological processes were mainly regulated by cancer, involving cellular response to mechanical stimulus, positive regulation of gene expression and transcription. Molecular docking analysis of the top hit compounds against the most enriched target proteins showed that 3-(2-methylpropanoyl)-4-cadinene-3,11-diol and O-(2-propenal) coniferaldehyde exhibited the most stabilized interactions. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to explain the stability of these two compounds in their protein-ligand complexes. Finally, confirmation of the potential anticancer activity was attained by in-vitro cytotoxicity testing of the extract on human prostate (PC-3), breast (MDA-MB-231), pancreatic (PANC-1) and melanoma (A375) cancerous cell lines. CONCLUSION: This study presents deeper insights into A. annua molecular mechanisms of action in cancer for the first time using an integrated approaches verifying the herb's value.",

      "abstract": "The plant Artemisia annua L. is famous for producing \"artemisinin\", which is an essential component in the treatment of malaria. The glandular secretory trichomes (GSTs) on the leaves of A. annua secrete and store artemisinin. Previous research has demonstrated that raising GST density can effectively raise artemisinin content. However, the molecular mechanism of GST initiation is not fully understood yet. In this study, we identified an MYB transcription factor, the AaMYB108-like, which is co-induced by light and jasmonic acid, and positively regulates glandular secretory trichome initiation in A. annua. Overexpression of the AaMYB108-like gene in A. annua increased GST density and enhanced the artemisinin content, whereas anti-sense of the AaMYB108-like gene resulted in the reduction in GST density and artemisinin content. Further experiments demonstrated that the AaMYB108-like gene could form a complex with AaHD8 to promote the expression of downstream AaHD1, resulting in the initiation of GST. Taken together, the AaMYB108-like gene is a positive regulator induced by light and jasmonic acid for GST initiation in A. annua.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Artemisia annua L. belongs to the Asteraceae family and has a long history of clinical application in China. It has been widely used for centuries to treat fever, malaria, jaundice and some skin diseases (such as scabies and sores). Modern pharmacological studies have shown that it has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antimalarial and antibacterial effects. AIM OF STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the anti-eczema effect of A. annua aqueous extract (AAE), profile its potential bioactive components and try to explore its possible underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MTT assay was employed to assess the cytotoxicity of AAE. The anti-eczema effect of AAE was evaluated using both an in vitro 3D epidermal inflammation model and an in vivo guinea pig itching model. The bioactive components of AAE were characterized by ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry coupled with the UNIFI platform. RESULTS: In this study, we found that AAE is safe for primary human skin keratinocytes at concentrations ranging from 31.3 μg/mL to 250 μg/mL. Further investigations indicate that AAE can increase the itching threshold, inhibit the expression of the inflammatory cytokine TSLP, and promote the expression of FLG mRNA. Additionally, the utilization of UPLC-QTOF/MS and UNIFI platform enabled us to identify 61 potential bioactive components of AAE, with sesquiterpenes and phenolic acids being the most abundant components. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the anti-inflammatory and anti-itch effects of the A. annua extract were revealed, along with sesquiterpenes and phenolic acids were identified as potential bioactive components according to literature. The AAE extract holds potential for utilization in the treatment of eczema.",

This study aimed to estimate further the efficacy and safety of a one-year course of Artemisia annua-sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) on SARC patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was an open-label, randomized, controlled, single-centre study involving 150 SARC patients induced by Artemisia, randomized to SLIT group (n = 75, SLIT along with pharmacotherapy) or control group (n = 75, pharmacotherapy only). According to the skin prick test (SPT) results, the SLIT group was divided into monosensitized and polysensitized groups to analyze the influence of sensitization status on the efficacy of Artemisia annua-SLIT. The clinical indicators of this study were total rhinoconjunctivitis symptom score (TRSS), total medication score (TMS), combined scores of medication and rhinoconjunctivitis symptom (CSMRS), and score of visual analog scale (VAS). Safety was evaluated by the occurrence of adverse events (AEs). Daily administration of the drops was recorded in diaries by the patients. RESULTS: After nearly one year of treatment and follow-ups, there was a significant decline in TRSS, TMS, CSMRS, and VAS from the baseline scores in the SLIT group (p < 0.001). However, as pollen counts increased in 2022, indicators above in the control group increased significantly during the peak pollen phase (PPP) in 2022 grass pollen season (GPS) compared to the baseline. Meanwhile, we found no significant difference in TRSS, TMS, CSMRS, and VAS between the monosensitized and polysensitized groups (p > 0.05). Moreover, the result indicated that the clinical improvement in TRSS, TMS, CSMRS, and VAS was still observed in polysensitized patients who were allergic to Artemisia pollen and sensitized to house dust mite (HDM) (n = 15) in PPP of 2022, compared to the baseline value (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Artemisia annua-SLIT was proven effective, tolerable and safe in patients with SARC after nearly one year of treatment, whether monosensitization or polysensitization.",

This study was conducted to investigate the anti-obesity properties of fermented Artemisia annua (AW) and Salicornia herbacea (GW) in vitro and in mice. The metabolite profiling of AW and GW extracts was performed using UHPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap-MS/MS, and gene expression was analyzed using real-time PCR for adipocyte difference factors. The anti-obesity effects in mice were measured using serum AST, ALT, glucose, TG, and cholesterol levels. Metabolites of the plant extracts after fermentation showed distinct differences with increasing anti-obesity active substances. The efficacy of inhibitory differentiation adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 adipocytes was better for GW than AW in a concentration-dependent manner. RT-PCR showed that the GW extract significantly reduced the expression of genes involved in adipocyte differentiation and fat accumulation (C/EBPα, PPARγ, and Fas). In C57BL/6 mice fed the HFD, the group supplemented with AW and GW showed reduced liver weight, NAS value, and fatty liver by suppressing liver fat accumulation. The GW group significantly reduced ALT, blood glucose, TG, total cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol. This study displayed significant metabolite changes through biotransformation in vitro and the increasing anti-obesity effects of GW and AW in mice. GW may be applicable as functional additives for the prevention and treatment of obesity.",

In this study, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) was used to investigate its effects on trichomes, artemisinin accumulation, and biosynthetic gene expression in A. anuua. The results showed that exogenous IAA could contribute to the growth and development of A. annua and increase the density of trichomes. Analysis using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) indicated that artemisinin and dihydroartemisinic acid (DHAA) contents were increased by 1.9-fold (1.1 mg/g) and 2.1-fold (0.51 mg/g) after IAA treatment in comparison with control lines (CK), respectively. Furthermore, quantitative real-time PCR results showed that AaADS, AaCYP71AV1, AaALDH1, and AaDBR2, four critical enzyme genes for the biosynthesis of artemisinin, had relatively high transcription levels in leaves of A. annua treated with IAA. In summary, this study indicated that exogenous IAA treatment was a feasible strategy to enhance artemisinin production, which paves the way for further metabolic engineering of artemisinin biosynthesis.",

It is unclear whether coseasonal-initiated sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) would be effective and safe for SARC. This study aims to identify the feasibility of initiating Artemisia annua SLIT during the pollen season. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty patients with Artemisia-induced SARC were equally recruited into the SLIT and control groups during the pollen season in 2021. The SLIT group was treated with standardized Artemisia annua SLIT drops using a modified dosing schedule combined with pharmacotherapy, while the control group only received pharmacotherapy. Diary cards for clinical symptoms, rescue medication use, and adverse events (AEs) were recorded during the pollen seasons. Objective measures, including average daily combined scores of medication and rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms (CSMRS), total rhinoconjunctivitis symptom score (TRSS), total medication score (TMS), and the score of visual analog scale (VAS) were calculated to evaluate the efficacy of SLIT. Safety was assessed through the occurrence and severity of AEs. RESULTS: In total, 80.0 % (24/30) patients in the SLIT group and 86.67 % (26/30) patients in the control group completed the study. The severity of SARC, which was assessed by objective measures including CSMRS, TRSS, TMS, and VAS of the SLIT group and the control group, was generally at the same level during the 2021 pollen season, except for the medical consumption, which the score of TMS was slightly higher in the SLIT group. After one year of treatment, the scores of CSMRS, TRSS, and VAS in the SLIT group were significantly improved compared with the control group (all P < 0.001), and the difference in the TMS between the two groups disappeared (P > 0.05). Moreover, clinical improvement of the four objective measures was also observed in the SLIT group compared with the baseline value (P < 0.001). Overall, 9/24 patients in the SLIT group experienced mild local AEs, and two patients experienced mild systemic AEs during the SLIT period. CONCLUSIONS: This controlled preliminary study identified that coseasonal-initiated Artemisia annua SLIT treatment for one year was generally safe and effective in improving the symptoms of SARC patients induced by Artemisia annua pollen.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Artemisia annua L. (Asteraceae) has been used as an antipyretic and anti-parasitic drug in traditional medicine for more than 2000 years. It has also been prescribed to treat symptoms caused by deficiency of Yin, which might be observed in menopausal state from the point of view of traditional medicine. AIM OF THE STUDY: We hypothesized that A. annua might be useful for treating menopausal disorders with less adverse effects than hormone replacement therapy. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate effects of A. annua on postmenopausal symptoms of ovariectomized (OVX) mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: OVX mice were employed as a model for postmenopausal disorders. Mice were treated with a water extract of A. annua (EAA; 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg, p.o.) or 17β-estradiol (E2; 0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) for 8 weeks. Open field test (OFT), novel object recognition task (NOR), Y-maze test, elevated plus maze test (EPM), splash test and tail suspension test (TST) were conducted to determine whether EAA could ameliorate postmenopausal symptoms. Phosphorylated levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), protein kinase B (Akt), and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), β-catenin and expression level of synaptophysin in the cortex and hippocampus were evaluated by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: EAA treatment significantly increased the discrimination index in NOR, decreased the time in closed arm than in open arm in EPM, increased grooming time in splash test, and decreased immobility time in TST, as did E2 treatment. In addition, decreased phosphorylation levels of ERK, Akt, GSK-3β, and β-catenin and expression levels of synaptophysin in the cortex and hippocampus after OVX were reversed by administration of EAA and E2. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that A. annua can ameliorate postmenopausal symptoms such as cognitive dysfunction, anxiety, anhedonia, and depression by activating ERK, Akt, and GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway and hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and that A. annua would be a novel treatment for postmenopausal symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Soil contamination by heavy metals poses a significant environmental challenge, as the practical implementation of existing remediation technologies in the field has encountered numerous obstacles. This has necessitated the requirement of finding alternate solutions to reduce the harm caused to plants. In this study, nitric oxide (NO) was investigated for its potential to reduce cadmium (Cd) toxicity in A. annua plants. Although NO plays a vital role in the growth and development of plants, information on its role in reducing abiotic stress in plants is limited. A. annua plants were exposed to 20 and 40 mg/kg Cd regardless of the addition of exogenous sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a NO donor, at 200 µM concentration. Results showed that SNP treatment improved plant growth, photosynthesis, chlorophyll fluorescence, pigment content, and artemisinin production while reducing Cd accumulation and improving membrane stability in A. annua during Cd stress. The results demonstrated that NO can effectively reverse Cd-induced damage in A. annua by modulating the antioxidant system, maintaining redox homeostasis, and improving photosynthetic performance and different fluorescence parameters such as Fv/Fm, ФPSII, and ETR. The supplementation of SNP caused a substantial improvement in chloroplast ultrastructure, stomatal behavior, and different attributes relate to glandular secretory trichomes, which in turn increased artemisinin production; 14.11 % in plants exposed to Cd stress of 20 mg/kg. Our findings highlight that NO could be useful in mediating the repair of Cd-induced damage to A. annua, and suggest that it may play a critical role in plant signaling networks, improving plant adaptability to Cd stress. The results have important implications for developing new strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of environmental contaminants on plant health, and ultimately, the ecosystem.",

The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Artemisia annua L. extract against the Actos drug side effects in the male albino mice. In present study, the use of Actos drug alone induced hepatotoxicity, renal inflammation, hematological disorders and bladder cancer, which are manifested by biochemical abnormalities and histopathological changes, moreover, the severity of toxicity depends on its dose. In contrast, the concurrent treatment with both Actos drug (45 mg/kg) and Artemisia extract (4 g/kg) was effective against the harmful side effects of the Actos drug. Where, the biochemical, hematological and histopathological investigations showed that the hepatotoxicity, renal inflammation, hematological disorders and histopathological changes were improved using combination of Actos and Artemisia extract. In addition, the results of TNF-ɑ oncogene expression levels in bladder tissues were significantly decreased by about 99.99% using the mix of both Actos drug and Artemisia extract. In conclusion, these findings reveal that the Artemisia annua extract on TNF-ɑ oncogene expression level is very significant and effective natural product against harmful side effects of pioglitazone which associated with an increased risk of incident bladder cancer among people, but for application more studies must be achieved in that field.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Artemisia annua L., known as \"sweet wormwood,\" is widely used in Egyptian folk medicine. Egyptians implement the aerial parts in the treatment of respiratory, digestive and sexual dysfunctions. However, the mechanism by which Artemisia annua improves testicular function is still being discovered. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to evaluate the modulatory effects of the crude leaf extract of Artemisia annua (AAE) on a high-fat diet induced testicular dysfunction in rats and compare it with the antilipolytic drug Orlistat. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty adult rats were randomly classified and assigned to four groups. The first group typically consumed a balanced diet and served as a negative control (GP1). A high-fat diet-induced obesity was applied to the other three groups for 12 weeks. A positive control remained on HFD for another 8 weeks, which is GP2. Other groups were administered for 8 consecutive weeks either with Orlistat (50 mg/kg body weight) or AAE (100 mg/kg body weight), which have been defined as GP3 and GP4, respectively. Testosterone (TST), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) were determined in the sera of all groups. In addition, the oxidant/antioxidant biomarkers such as protein carbonyl, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) activities, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase isoenzyme-B (CK-MB) were determined. An immunohistochemical stain with the apoptotic marker caspase-3 and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were also investigated. RESULTS: In the testes of the obese group, the results showed hormonal imbalance, an increase in oxidative stress biomarkers and apoptosis. In the group treated with orlistat (GP3), noticeably more perturbations were noted. The obese rats that had been treated with AAE (GP4) showed a significantly reduced level of oxidative stress, hormonal balance restoration and reduced apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The crude leaf extract of A. annua is a potential herbal therapeutic for the treatment of obesity-related testicular dysfunction and the restoration of hormonal imbalance in obese rats.",

      "abstract": "Artemisia annua L. is a medicinal plant valued for its ability to produce artemisinin, a molecule used to treat malaria. Plant nutrients, especially phosphorus (P), can potentially influence plant biomass and secondary metabolite production. Our work aimed to explore the genetic and metabolic response of A. annua to hardly soluble aluminum phosphate (AlPO4, AlP), using soluble monopotassium phosphate (KH2PO4, KP) as a control. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to analyze artemisinin. RNA sequencing, gene ontology (GO), and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were applied to analyze the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under poor P conditions. Results showed a significant reduction in plant growth parameters, such as plant height, stem diameter, number of leaves, leaf areas, and total biomass of A. annua. Conversely, LC-MS analysis revealed a significant increase in artemisinin concentration under the AlP compared to the KP. Transcriptome analysis revealed 762 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the AlP and the KP. GH3, SAUR, CRE1, and PYL, all involved in plant hormone signal transduction, showed differential expression. Furthermore, despite the downregulation of HMGR in the artemisinin biosynthesis pathway, the majority of genes (ACAT, FPS, CYP71AV1, and ALDH1) were upregulated, resulting in increased artemisinin accumulation in the AlP. In addition, 12 transcription factors, including GATA and MYB, were upregulated in response to AlP, confirming their importance in regulating artemisinin biosynthesis. Overall, our findings could contribute to a better understanding the parallel transcriptional regulation of plant hormone transduction and artemisinin biosynthesis in A. annua L. in response to hardly soluble phosphorus fertilizer.",

Previous studies reported that ART may exert a dual effect on the liver. Accordingly, this study investigated the potential protective action of ART against Acetaminophen (APAP) and Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatotoxicity in primary mice hepatocytes, in comparison to that of flavonoid extracted from A. annua (FAA). In addition, the antioxidant properties of FAA were also assessed. METHODS: The antioxidant activities of FAA and Ascorbic acid (ASC) (0.01-100 μg/mL) were assessed through inhibition of lipid peroxidation, reduction of ferric and phosphomolydenum, and hydroxyl and DPPH radicals scavenging assays. The hepatoprotective effects of FAA and ART (0.1-100 μg/mL) were evaluated against APAP (11 mM) or CCl4 (4 mM) induced oxidative damage in primary mouse hepatocytes. Biochemical parameters associated with hepatotoxicity assessed include cell viability, cell membrane integrity, cellular glutathione, and antioxidant enzyme activities. RESULTS: The obtained finding revealed FAA displayed a remarkable antioxidant activities as evidenced by the low IC50/EC50 values (3.85-19.32 μg/mL), comparable to that of ASC (3.26-18.04 μg/mL). When tested at 10 μg/mL, both FAA and ART significantly (p˂0.05) preserved cell viability, inhibited alanine aminotransferase leakage and lipid membrane peroxidation, and restored superoxide dismutase and catalase activities and glutathione content induced by APAP or CCl4 in a similar way as Silymarin. However, ART showed a significant (p˂0.05) cytotoxic effect on hepatocytes at 100 and 1000 μg/mL and did not confer obvious protection at 100 μg/mL. CONCLUSION: Overall, our data demonstrated that ART harms mice hepatocytes at high concentration while conferring relative protection against APAP and CCl4-hepatotoxicity at low concentration. In contrast, FAA effectively protects liver cells without cytotoxicity effect, event at 100 μg/mL. Accordingly, ART should be given to the patient only under a medical prescription."

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The overproduction of reactive oxygen species observed in AD patients results in the loss of mitochondrial function, altered metal ion homeostasis, lipopolysaccharide metabolism disorder, reduced anti-oxidant defense, increased release of inflammatory factors, and the aggravation and accumulation of amyloid-beta and tau hyper-phosphorylation, which directly cause synaptic and neuronal loss and lead to cognitive dysfunction. Thus, oxidative stress proves to be a fundamental part of AD development and progression, suggesting the potential benefits of anti-oxidant-based therapies for AD. In this study, we found that a water-soluble extract of Artemisia annua (WSEAA), a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, has a strong anti-oxidant function. We also found that WSEAA is able to improve the cognitive function of 3xTg AD mice. However, the mechanisms and molecular targets underlying WSEAA action are still not known. In order to uncover the potential molecular mechanisms involved, we used a combination of network pharmacology and different experimental approaches. Obtained results revealed key genes (such as AKT1, BCL2, IL-6, TNF-[Formula: see text] and BAX) and signaling pathways (like PI3K-AKT and BCL2/BAX) are closely associated with the biological processes responding to oxidative stress. Further verification of the survival/anti-oxidant effects of WSEAA in vitro and in vivo showed that the extract has anti-oxidatant/neuronal survival action against H2O2-induced damage, and is thus able to prevent the cognitive decline and pathological changes of 3xTg transgenic (3xTg) mice via the regulation of key target-genes and pathways, such as PI3K-AKT and BCL2/BAX, related to survival/apoptosis. Our findings strongly indicate the potential of WSEAA for the prevention and treatment of AD.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by the occurrence of cognitive deficits. With no effective treatments available, the search for new effective therapies has become a major focus of interest. In the present study, we describe the potential therapeutic effect of Artemisia annua (A. annua) extract on AD. Nine-month-old female 3xTg AD mice were treated with A. annua extract for three months via oral administration. Animals assigned to WT and model groups were administrated with an equal volume of water for the same period. Treated AD mice significantly improved the cognitive deficits and exhibited reduced Aβ accumulation, hyper-phosphorylation of tau, inflammatory factor release and apoptosis when compared with untreated AD mice. Moreover, A. annua extract promoted the survival and proliferation of neural progenitor cells (NPS) and increased the expression of synaptic proteins. Further assessment of the implicated mechanisms revealed that A. annua extract regulates the YAP signaling pathway in 3xTg AD mice. Further studies comprised the incubation of PC12 cells with Aβ1-42 at a concentration of 8 μM with or without different concentrations of A. annua extract for 24 h. Obtained ROS levels, mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase-3 activity, neuronal cell apoptosis and assessment of the signaling pathways involved was performed using western blot and immunofluorescence staining. The obtained results showed that A. annua extract significantly reversed the Aβ1-42-induced increase in ROS levels, caspase-3 activity and neuronal cell apoptosis in vitro. Moreover, either inhibition of the YAP signaling pathway, using a specific inhibitor or CRISPR cas9 knockout of YAP gene, reduced the neuroprotective effect of the A. annua extract. These findings suggest that A. annua extract may be a new multi-target anti-AD drug with potential use in the prevention and treatment of AD.",

Although yeast engineering and plant synthetic biology have shown promising results, plant genetic engineering is considered the most feasible strategy, but it is also constrained by the stability of progeny development. Here we constructed three independent unique overexpressing vectors harboring three mainstream artemisinin biosynthesis enzymes HMGR, FPS, and DBR2, as well as two trichomes-specific transcription factors AaHD1 and AaORA. The simultaneous co-transformation of these vectors by Agrobacterium resulted in the successful increase of the artemisinin content in T0 transgenic lines by up to 3.2-fold (2.72%) leaf dry weight compared to the control plants. We also investigated the stability of transformation in progeny T1 lines. The results indicated that the transgenic genes were successfully integrated, maintained, and overexpressed in some of the T1 progeny plants' genomes, potentially increasing the artemisinin content by up to 2.2-fold (2.51%) leaf dry weight. These results indicated that the co-overexpression of multiple enzymatic genes and transcription factors via the constructed vectors provided promising results, which could be used to achieve the ultimate goal of a steady supply of artemisinin at affordable prices around the world."

      "abstract": "Agricultural soil contamination and subsequently crops still require alternative solutions to reduce associated environmental risks. The effects of strigolactones (SLs) in alleviating cadmium (Cd) phytotoxicity in Artemisia annua plants were investigated during this study. Strigolactones play a vital role during plant growth and development due to their complex interplay during a plethora of biochemical processes. However, information on the potential of SLs to elicit abiotic stress signaling and trigger physiological modifications in plants is limited. In order to decipher the same, A. annua plants were exposed to different concentrations of Cd (20 and 40 mg kg-1), with or without the supplementation of exogenous SL (GR24, a SL analogue) at 4 µM concentration. Under Cd stress, excess Cd accumulation resulted in reduced growth, physio-biochemical traits, and artemisinin content. However, the follow-up treatment of GR24 maintained a steady state equilibrium between reactive oxygen species and antioxidant enzymes, improved chlorophyll fluorescence parameters such as Fv/Fm, ФPSII, and ETR for improved photosynthesis, enhanced chlorophyll content, maintained chloroplast ultrastructure, improved the glandular trichome (GT) attributes and artemisinin production in A. annua. Moreover, it also resulted in improved membrane stability, reduced Cd accumulation, and regulated the behaviour of stomatal apertures for better stomatal conductance under Cd stress. The results of our study suggest that GR24 could be highly effective in alleviating Cd-induced damages in A. annua. It acts via the modulation of the antioxidant enzyme system for redox homeostasis, protection of the chloroplasts and pigments for improved photosynthetic performance, and improved GT attributes for enhanced artemisinin production in A. annua.",

      "abstract": "Four types of cells were engineered from Artemisia annua to produce approximately 17 anthocyanins, four of which were elucidated structurally. All of them expressed the artemisinin pathway. Artemisia annua is the only medicinal crop to produce artemisinin for the treatment of malignant malaria. Unfortunately, hundreds of thousands of people still lose their life every year due to the lack of sufficient artemisinin. Artemisinin is considered to result from the spontaneous autoxidation of dihydroartemisinic acid in the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in an oxidative condition of glandular trichomes (GTs); however, whether increasing antioxidative compounds can inhibit artemisinin biosynthesis in plant cells is unknown. Anthocyanins are potent antioxidants that can remove ROS in plant cells. To date, no anthocyanins have been structurally elucidated from A. annua. In this study, we had two goals: (1) to engineer anthocyanins in A. annua cells and (2) to understand the artemisinin biosynthesis in anthocyanin-producing cells. Arabidopsis Production of Anthocyanin Pigment 1 was used to engineer four types of transgenic anthocyanin-producing A. annua (TAPA1-4) cells. Three wild-type cell types were developed as controls. TAPA1 cells produced the highest contents of total anthocyanins. LC-MS analysis detected 17 anthocyanin or anthocyanidin compounds. Crystallization, LC/MS/MS, and NMR analyses identified cyanidin, pelargonidin, one cyanin, and one pelargonin. An integrative analysis characterized that four types of TAPA cells expressed the artemisinin pathway and TAPA1 cells produced the highest artemisinin and artemisinic acid. The contents of arteannuin B were similar in seven cell types. These data showed that the engineering of anthocyanins does not eliminate the biosynthesis of artemisinin in cells. These data allow us to propose a new hypothesis that enzymes catalyze the formation of artemisinin from dihydroartemisinic acid in non-GT cells. These findings show a new platform to increase artemisinin production via non-GT cells of A. annua.",

Growth and secondary metabolism of A. annua are strongly regulated by environmental conditions, causing unstable supply and quality of raw materials from field grown plants. This study aimed to bring A. annua into greenhouse cultivation and to increase artemisinin production by manipulating greenhouse light environment using LEDs. A. annua plants were grown in a greenhouse compartment for five weeks in vegetative stage with either supplemental photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (blue, green, red or white) or supplemental radiation outside PAR wavelength (far-red, UV-B or both). The colour of supplemental PAR hardly affected plant morphology and biomass, except that supplemental green decreased plant biomass by 15% (both fresh and dry mass) compared to supplemental white. Supplemental far-red increased final plant height by 23% whereas it decreased leaf area, plant fresh and dry weight by 30%, 17% and 7%, respectively, compared to the treatment without supplemental radiation. Supplemental UV-B decreased plant leaf area and dry weight (both by 7%). Interestingly, supplemental green and UV-B increased leaf glandular trichome density by 11% and 9%, respectively. However, concentrations of artemisinin, arteannuin B, dihydroartemisinic acid and artemisinic acid only exhibited marginal differences between the light treatments. There were no interactive effects of far-red and UV-B on plant biomass, morphology, trichome density and secondary metabolite concentrations. Our results illustrate the potential of applying light treatments in greenhouse production of A. annua to increase trichome density in vegetative stage. However, the trade-off between light effects on plant growth and trichome initiation needs to be considered. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms of light spectrum regulation on artemisinin biosynthesis need further clarification to enhance artemisinin yield in greenhouse production of A. annua."

PURPOSE: In this study, the improvement in cognitive impairment by AA in terms of protection against oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and preservation of the integrity of the neurovascular unit (NVU) was assessed in an animal model of VaD with bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO). METHODS: Eight-week-old male Wistar rats were allowed to adapt for four weeks, and BCCAO was induced at 12 weeks of age. The rats were randomly assigned into four groups, with seven rats in each group: sham group without BCCAO, VaD group that received oral administration of distilled water after BCCAO surgery, and two AA groups that received oral administration of 150 mg/kg or 750 mg/kg AA after BCCAO surgery for 8 weeks. Nine weeks after BCCAO surgery, the cognitive function of the rats was evaluated and accumulated oxidative stress was assessed by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and western blotting. Damage to the components of the NVU was evaluated, and sirtuin (Sirt) 1 and 2 expression and nuclear factor-erythrocyte 2-associated factor 2 (Nrf2)/Kelch-like ECH-associated protein1 (Keap1) activation were investigated to assess the reduction in cell signaling and antioxidant pathways. RESULTS: BCCAO-induced cerebral perfusion decreased memory function and induced neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. But AA treatment mitigated cognitive impairment and reduced neuroinflammation and oxidative stress caused by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. AA extracts activated the Nrf2/Keap1/activating antioxidant response elements pathway and maintained Sirt 1 and 2, subsequently leading to the maintenance of neurons, improved construct of microvessels, increased platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta, and platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 associated with the blood-brain barrier integrity. CONCLUSION: AA is effective in alleviating BCCAO-induced cognitive decline and its administration may be a useful therapeutic approach for VaD.",

Previous studies have shown that both light and jasmonic acid (JA) can promote the biosynthesis of artemisinin, and the promotion of artemisinin by JA is dependent on light. However, the specific molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report a MYB transcription factor, AaMYB108, identified from transcriptome analysis of light and JA treatment, as a positive regulator of artemisinin biosynthesis in A. annua. AaMYB108 promotes artemisinin biosynthesis by interacting with a previously characterized positive regulator of artemisinin, AaGSW1. Then, we found that AaMYB108 interacted with AaCOP1 and AaJAZ8, respectively. The function of AaMYB108 was influenced by AaCOP1 and AaJAZ8. Through the treatment of AaMYB108 transgenic plants with light and JA, it was found that the promotion of artemisinin by light and JA depends on the presence of AaMYB108. Taken together, our results reveal the molecular mechanism of JA regulating artemisinin biosynthesis depending on light in A. annua. This study provides new insights into the integration of light and phytohormone signaling to regulate terpene biosynthesis in plants.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the aqueous extract of A. annua (AAE) as an antimicrobial agent in vitro and to evaluate its chemopreventive efficacy in vivo in a small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) animal model. The dried powder of AAE was prepared using the Soxhlet extraction system from the leaves of Artemisia annua. The in vitro activity of AAE was determined against Candida albicans (C. albicans), Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) using the agar well diffusion method and propidium iodide (PI)-stained microbial death under a confocal microscope. The pretreatment of mice with AAE was initiated two weeks before the first dose of benzo[a]pyrene and continued for 21 weeks. The chemopreventive potential of the extract was evaluated by flow cytometry and biochemical and histopathological analyses of the tissues and serum accordingly, after sacrificing the mice. The data revealed the antimicrobial potential of AAE against all the species investigated, as it showed growth-inhibitory activity by MIC, as well as confocal microscopy. The pretreatment of AAE exhibited significant protection in carcinogen-modulated, average body weight (ABW), and relative organ weight (ROW) cancer biomarkers in the serum and antioxidants in the lungs. The hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of the tissues revealed that AAE prevented malignancy in the lungs. AAE also induced apoptosis and decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the lung cells analyzed by flow cytometry. The current findings demonstrated the use of AAE as an alternative medicine in the treatment of infectious disease and the chemoprevention of lung cancer. To our knowledge, this is the first study that summarizes the chemopreventive potential of AAE in a lung cancer model in vivo. However, further investigations are suggested to understand the role of AAE to potentiate the therapeutic index of the commercially available drugs that show multiple drug resistance against microbial growth and high toxicity during cancer chemotherapy."

      "abstract": "Background: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a degenerative disease that causes health problems in humans. However, there are no effective drugs for the treatment of AAA. Artemisia annua L. (A. annua) is a traditional herbal that has been widely used in cardiovascular disease. Based on network pharmacology and molecular docking technology, this study predicted the practical components and potential mechanisms of A. annua inhibiting the occurrence and development of AAA. Methods: The main active ingredients and targets of A. annua were screened through the TCMSP database; the GeneCards, OMIM, PharmGkb, and TTD databases were used to search for the targeted genes of AAA and map them to the targets of the active ingredients to obtain the active ingredient therapy of A. annua. The targets of AAA were to construct a protein interaction network through the STRING platform. R software was used to carry out the enrichment analysis of GO and KEGG for relevant targets, and Cytoscape was used to construct the active ingredient-target network prediction model of A. annua. Finally, AutoDock Vina was used to verify the results of the active ingredients and critical targets. Results: The main active ingredients obtained from A. annua for the treatment of AAA include quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, isorhamnetin, and artemetin, as well as 117 effective targets, including RELA, MAPK14, CCND1, MAPK1, AKT1, MYC, MAPK8, TP53, ESR1, FOS, and JUN. The 11 targeted genes might play a key role in disease treatment. Enriched in 2115 GO biological processes, 159 molecular functions, 56 cellular components, and 156 KEGG pathways, inferred that its mechanism of action might be related to PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, fluid shear stress, atherosclerosis, and AGE-RAGE signaling pathway. Molecular docking results showed that the top five active components of A. annua had a good affinity for core disease targets and played a central role in treating AAA. The low binding energy molecular docking results provided valuable information for the development of drugs to treat AAA. Conclusion: Therefore, A. annua may have multiple components, multiple targets, and multiple signaling pathways to play a role in treating AAA. A. annua may have the potential to treat AAA."

In addition, recent studies have investigated the cytotoxic effects of A. annua extracts towards cancer cells. The leading aim of the present research is to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of an hydroalcoholic extract of A. annua on two canine osteosarcoma (OSA) cell lines, OSCA-8 and OSCA-40, focusing on the possible involvement of ferroptosis. The quantitative determination of artemisinin concentration in the extract, culture medium and OSA cells was carried out through the use of an instrumental analytical method based on liquid chromatography coupled with spectrophotometric detection and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-DAD-MS/MS). OSCA-8 and OSCA-40 were exposed to different dilutions of the extract for the EC50 calculation then the uptake of artemisinin by the cells, the effects on the cell cycle, the intracellular iron level, the cellular morphology and the lipid oxidation state were evaluated. A concentration of artemisinin of 63.8 ± 3.4 μg/mL was detected in the extract. A dose-dependent cytotoxic effect was evidenced. In OSCA-40 alterations of the cell cycle and a significantly higher intracellular iron content were observed. In both cell lines the treatment with the extract was associated with lipid peroxidation and with the appearance of a \"ballooning\" phenotype suggesting the activation of ferroptosis. In conclusion the A. annua idroalcoholic extract utilized in this study showed anticancer activity on canine OSA cell lines that could be useful in treating drug resistant canine OSAs.",

      "abstract": "The plant Artemisia annua is well known for its production of artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone that is an effective antimalarial compound. Although remarkable progress has been made toward understanding artemisinin biosynthesis, the effect of MADS-box family transcription factors on artemisinin biosynthesis is still poorly understood. In this study, we identified a MADS transcription factor, AaSEP4, that was predominantly expressed in trichome. AaSEP4 acts as a nuclear-localized transcriptional activator activating the expression of AaGSW1 (GLANDULAR TRICHOME-SPECIFIC WRKY1). Dual-luciferase and Yeast one-hybrid assays revealed that AaSEP4 directly bound to the CArG motif in the promoter region of AaGSW1. Overexpression of AaSEP4 in A. annua significantly induced the expression of AaGSW1 and four artemisinin biosynthesis genes, including amorpha-4,11-diene synthase (ADS), cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP71AV1), double-bond reductase 2 (DBR2) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1). Furthermore, the results of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that the artemisinin content was significantly increased in the AaSEP4-overexpressed plants. In addition, RT-qPCR results showed that AaSEP4 was induced by methyl jasmonic acid (MeJA) treatment. Taken together, these results explicitly demonstrate that AaSEP4 is a positive regulator of artemisinin biosynthesis, which can be used in the development of high-artemisinin yielding A. annua varieties."

A total of 200 one-day-old Arbor Acre broilers were randomly allotted into five dietary treatment groups, with five replicates per treatment and eight broilers per replicate. The five treatment diets were formulated by adding, respectively, 0 (control group), 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 g/kg AAE in the basal diet. The results showed that dietary inclusion of AAE quadratically decreased interleukin (IL)-1β content, linearly decreased IL-6 content in the small intestine through regulating the nuclear factor-kappa B signal pathway, and quadratically increased immunoglobulin (Ig)M and sIgA content in ileum and jejunum. Besides, there was a quadratic decrease in the gene expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) in ileum on day 21, and the gene expression of IL-6 and TLR4 in duodenum on day 42, thereby improving small intestinal immune function in broilers. Additionally, dietary inclusion of AAE improves antioxidative function through the nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signal pathway in the small intestinal mucosa of broilers, especially, quadratically increased catalase (CAT) and superoxidase dismutase activity in ileum, and total antioxidant capacity and glutathione peroxidase activity in duodenum, and quadratically decreased malondialdehyde concentration in ileum, besides, linearly increased heme oxygenase-1 and Nrf2 gene expression in jejunum and ileum on day 42, quadratically increased CAT gene expression in the small intestine. Furthermore, regression analyses of the above parameters showed that the optimal dose range of AAE in the diet of broilers was 1.12-1.38 g/kg."

Medicinal plants are frequently used for T2D treatment. This study investigates the effect of Artemisia annua L. (AA) extracts on adipokines in mice with high-fat-diet (HFD)/streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T2D. METHODS: We divided 60 mice into 12 groups (n = 5 per group) control, untreated T2D, treated T2D, and 9 other groups. T2D was induced in all groups, except controls, by 8 weeks of HFD and STZ injection. The treated T2D group was administered 250 mg/kg of metformin (MTF), while the nine other groups were treated with 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg of hot-water extract (HWE), cold-water extract (CWE), and alcoholic extract (ALE) of AA (daily oral gavage) along with 250 mg/kg of MTF for 4 weeks. The intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) was performed, and the homeostasis model assessment of adiponectin (HOMA-AD) index and blood glucose and serum insulin, leptin, adiponectin, and resistin levels were measured. RESULTS: Similar to MTF, all three types of AA extracts (HWEs, CWEs, and ALEs) significantly (p < 0.0001) decreased the area under the curve (AUC) of glucose during the IPGTT, the HOMA-AD index, blood glucose levels, and serum insulin, leptin, and resistin levels and increased serum adiponectin levels in the MTF group compared to the T2D group (p < 0.0001). The HWEs affected adipokine release, while the CWEs and ALEs decreased leptin and resistin production. CONCLUSION: Water and alcoholic AA extracts have an antihyperglycemic and antihyperinsulinemic effect on HFD/STZ diabetic mice. In addition, they decrease IR by reducing leptin and resistin production and increasing adiponectin secretion from adipocytes."

The plant extract has shown significant activity against both the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the novel SARS-CoV-2 that is currently ravaging the world. It is therefore necessary to evaluate individual chemicals of the plant for inhibitory potential against SARS-CoV-2 for the purpose of designing drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. In this study, we employed computational techniques comprising molecular docking, binding free energy calculations, pharmacophore modeling, induced-fit docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and ADMET predictions to identify potential inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) from 168 bioactive compounds of Artemisia annua. Rhamnocitrin, isokaempferide, kaempferol, quercimeritrin, apigenin, penduletin, isoquercitrin, astragalin, luteolin-7-glucoside, and isorhamnetin were ranked the highest, with docking scores ranging from -7.84 to -7.15 kcal/mol compared with the -6.59 kcal/mol demonstrated by the standard ligand. Rhamnocitrin, Isokaempferide, and kaempferol, like the standard ligand, interacted with important active site amino acid residues like HIS 41, CYS 145, ASN 142, and GLU 166, among others. Rhamnocitrin demonstrated good stability in the active site of the protein as there were no significant conformational changes during the simulation process. These compounds also possess acceptable druglike properties and a good safety profile. Hence, they could be considered for experimental studies and further development of drugs against COVID-19."

The molecular basis underpinning the anticancer activity is complex and not fully understood, but the herbal polysaccharides, broadly recognised as having immunomodulatory, antioxidant and anticancer activities, are potential key active agents. To examine the functions of polysaccharides from A. annua, their immunomodulatory and antioxidant potentials were evaluated, as well as their structural characterization. The water-soluble polysaccharides (AAPs) were fractionated using size-exclusion chromatography to obtain three dominant fractions, AAP-1, AAP-2 and AAP-3, having molecular masses centered around 1684, 455 and 5.8kDa, respectively. The antioxidant potentials of the isolated polysaccharides were evaluated by measuring radical scavenging activities against DPPH● (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical), ABTS●+ (2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid radical ion), and the OH● (hydroxyl radical). AAP-1 displayed high antioxidant activities against these radicals, which were 68%, 73% and 78%, respectively. AAP-2 displayed lower scavenging activities than the other two fractions. Immunostimulatory activities of AAPs were measured using mouse macrophages. The three polysaccharide fractions displayed significant antioxidant activities and stimulated the production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). AAP-1 showed significant immunostimulatory activity (16-fold increase in the production of IL-6 compared to the control and 13-fold increase in the production of TNF-α) with low toxicity (>60% cell viability at 125 μg/mL concentration). Preliminary structural characterization of the AAPs was carried out using gas chromatography (GC) and FTIR techniques. The results indicate that AAP-1 and AAP-2 are pyranose-containing polysaccharides with β-linkages, and AAP-3 is a β-fructofuranoside. The results suggest that these polysaccharides are potential candidates for immunotherapy and cancer treatment.",

Using biotechnological applications such as tissue culture, genetic engineering, and bioreactor-based approaches would aid in the upregulation of artemisinin yield, which is needed for the future. The current review focuses on the tissue culture aspects of propagation of A. annua and production of artemisinin from A. annua L. cell and organ cultures. The review also focuses on elicitation strategies in cell and organ cultures, as well as artemisinin biosynthesis and metabolic engineering of biosynthetic genes in Artemisia and plant model systems.",

      "abstract": "Artemisia annua is the main natural source of artemisinin production. In A. annua, extended drought stress severely reduces its biomass and artemisinin production while short-term water-withholding or abscisic acid (ABA) treatment can increase artemisinin biosynthesis. ABA-responsive transcription factor AabZIP1 and JA signaling AaMYC2 have been shown in separate studies to promote artemisinin production by targeting several artemisinin biosynthesis genes. Here, we found AabZIP1 promote the expression of multiple artemisinin biosynthesis genes including AaDBR2 and AaALDH1, which AabZIP1 does not directly activate. Subsequently, it was found that AabZIP1 up-regulates AaMYC2 expression through direct binding to its promoter, and that AaMYC2 binds to the promoter of AaALDH1 to activate its transcription. In addition, AabZIP1 directly transactivates wax biosynthesis genes AaCER1 and AaCYP86A1. The biosynthesis of artemisinin and cuticular wax and the tolerance of drought stress were significantly increased by AabZIP1 overexpression, whereas they were significantly decreased in RNAi-AabZIP1 plants. Collectively, we have uncovered the AabZIP1-AaMYC2 transcriptional module as a point of cross-talk between ABA and JA signaling in artemisinin biosynthesis, which may have general implications. We have also identified AabZIP1 as a promising candidate gene for the development of A. annua plants with high artemisinin content and drought tolerance in metabolic engineering breeding."

However, the natural concentration of artemisinin in planta is low. Plant nutrition, in particular phosphorus, and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can affect both plant biomass and secondary metabolite production. In this work, A. annua plants were ino- culated or not with the AM fungus Funneliformis mosseae BEG12 and cultivated for 2 months in controlled conditions at three different phosphatic (P) concentrations (32, 96, and 288 µM). Plant growth parameters, leaf photosynthetic pigment concentrations, artemisinin production, and mineral uptake were evaluated. The different P levels significantly affected the plant shoot growth, AM fungal colonization, and mineral acquisition. High P levels negatively influenced mycorrhizal colonization. The artemisinin concentration was inversely correlated to the P level in the substrate. The fungus mainly affected root growth and nutrient uptake and significantly lowered leaf artemisinin concentration. In conclusion, P nutrition can influence plant biomass production and the lowest phosphate level led to the highest artemisinin concentration, irrespective of the plant mineral uptake. Plant responses to AM fungi can be modulated by cost-benefit ratios of the mutualistic exchange between the partners and soil nutrient availability."

Then, we tried to explain part of the function of its possible mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Essential oil was extracted from Artemisia annua L. Osteoclasts were induced in vitro by RANKL in mouse RAW264.7 cells. The experimental group was treated with different concentrations of AEO, while the control group was not treated with AEO. CCK8 was used to detect osteoclast proliferation. The osteoclasts were stained with TRAP. Western blot was used to detect protein in the MAPK pathway and the NF-κB pathway after treatment with different concentrations of AEO. RT-PCR was used to determine the expression of osteoclast-related mRNA in cells. RESULTS: The GC-MS analysis was used to obtain the main components of AEO, including camphor, borneol, camphor, borneol, terpinen-4-ol, p-cymene, eucalyptol, deoxyartemisinin, and artemisia ketone. The CCK8 results showed that the AEO volume ratio of 1 : 4000, 1 : 5000, and 1 : 6000 did not affect the proliferation of RAW264.7 cells. However, TRAP staining showed that AEO decreased osteoclast formation. Western blot results showed that the expression of protein TRAF6, p-p38, p-ERK, p-p65, and NFATc1 decreased in the MAPK pathway and the NF-κB pathway affected by AEO. Furthermore, RT-PCR results showed that the expression of osteoclast resorption-related mRNAs (MMP-9, DC-STAMP, TRAP, and CTSK) and osteoclast differentiation-related mRNAs (OSCAR, NFATc1, c-Src, and c-Fos) also decreased in the experimental group. CONCLUSIONS: AEO inhibits osteoclast differentiation in vitro, probably by reducing TRAF6 activation, acting on the MAPK pathway and NF-κB pathway, and inhibiting the expression of osteoclast-related genes."

Considering these facts and the immense medicinal value of artemisinin, the enhancement of in planta production of artemisinin is highly desirable. As strigolactones are known to regulate various aspects of plant growth and development, the effects of foliar spray of different concentrations of synthetic strigolactone analog GR24 (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 µM) on A. annua were studied. As compared to the control group, the foliar application of GR24 had a positive impact on general growth, photosynthesis, and other physiological indices with 4 µM GR24 showing the best results. The results indicate that GR24 application increased the plant biomass and various attributes related to photosynthesis, like total chlorophyll content, chlorophyll fluorescence, stomatal conductance, internal CO2, and net photosynthetic rate. Moreover, the activity of various enzymes related to photosynthesis like carbonic anhydrase, nitrate reductase, and RuBisCO was escalated. The GR24 also improved certain attributes related to glandular trichomes, with a significant enhancement in content and yield of artemisinin as compared to untreated plants."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Artemisia annua L. (A. annua) and its active components exhibit antitumour effects in many cancer cells. However, the biological processes and mechanisms involved are not well understood, especially for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PURPOSE: This study aimed to comprehensively explore the biological processes of A. annua and its active components in NSCLC cells and to identify the mechanism by which these compounds induce apoptosis. STUDY DESIGNS/METHODS: Cell viability and flow cytometry assays were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of A. annua active components casticin (CAS) and chrysosplenol D (CHD) in A. annua in NSCLC cells. After treatment with CAS and CHD, A549 cells were subjected to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened and subjected to functional enrichment analysis (KEGG and GO analysis) as well as protein interaction network analysis. The key targets associated with apoptosis induction in A549 cells were screened by Cytoscape, and the screened DEGs were validated by qRT-PCR. Immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and molecular docking assays were used to determine whether CAS and/or CHD could induce apoptosis in NSCLC cells by inducing DNA damage through down-regulation of topoisomerase IIα (topo IIα) expression. The same experiments were verified again in the H1299 lung cancer cell line. RESULTS: CAS and CHD inhibited NSCLC cells proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and significantly induced apoptosis. A total of 115 co-upregulated DEGs and 277 co-downregulated DEGs were identified in A549 cells following treatment with CAS and CHD. Comprehensive and systematic data about biological processes and mechanisms were obtained. DNA damage pathways and topo IIα targets were screened to study the apoptosis effects of CAS and CHD on NSCLC cells. CAS and CHD may be able to induce DNA damage by binding to topo IIα-DNA and reducing topo IIα activity. CONCLUSION: This study suggested that CAS and CHD may reduce topo IIα activity by binding to topo IIα-DNA, affecting the replication of DNA, triggering DNA damage, and inducing apoptosis. It described a novel mechanism associated with topo IIα inhibition to reveal a novel role for CAS and CHD in A. annua as potential anticancer agents and/or adjuvants in NSCLC cells.",

Herein, two nematicidal sesquiterpenoid acids artemisinic acid (ArA) and dihydroartemisinic acid (DHArA) were isolated from the methanol extract of the aerial parts of A. annua L. by the bioassay-guided isolation method using Meloidogyne incognita second stage juveniles (J2s) as the screening target. The in vitro activity, control efficacy in the pot experiment, and toxic effects of these two natural compounds against M. incognita were evaluated. The in vitro results showed that the EC50/48h values of ArA and DHArA were 0.37 mM and 0.76 mM against J2s, respectively. In the pot experiment, ArA and DHArA at the dose of 5 mg (a.i.)/pot could achieve the same level of control efficacy compared with avermectins at 2 mg (a.i.)/pot. Microscopic observations indicated the obvious toxic symptoms of J2s after ArA- and DHArA-treatment, including the shrinking body, imperfect body wall, and undiscerning organs. The physiological and biochemical studies, together with the toxic symptoms, revealed that ArA and DHArA had great impacts on the membrane system of J2s. Additionally, ArA occurring the α, β-unsaturated carbonyl was demonstrated to be reactive with glutathione (GSH) and cause the decrease of GSH content in J2s. Taken together, the present study suggests that ArA and DHArA or ArA- and DHArA-based extracts of A. annua L. have a substantial potential to be used as botanical agents for integrated disease management programs against root-knot nematodes in crop protection.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Productivities of bioactive compounds in high-value herbs and medicinal plants are often compromised by uncontrollable environmental parameters. Recent advances in the development of plant factories with artificial lighting (PFAL) have led to improved qualitative and/or quantitative production of bioactive compounds in several medicinal plants. However, information concerning the effect of light qualities on plant pharmaceutical properties is limited. The influence of three different light-emitting diode (LED) spectra on leaf fresh weight (FW), bioactive compound production and bioactivity of Artemisia annua L. against the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum NF54 was investigated. Correlation between the A. annua metabolites and antimalarial activity of light-treated plant extracts were also determined. RESULTS: Artemisia annua plants grown under white and blue spectra that intersected at 445 nm exhibited higher leaf FW and increased amounts of artemisinin and artemisinic acid, with enhanced production of several terpenoids displaying a variety of pharmacological activities. Conversely, the red spectrum led to diminished production of bioactive compounds and a distinct metabolite profile compared with other wavelengths. Crude extracts obtained from white and blue spectral treatments exhibited 2 times higher anti-Plasmodium falciparum activity than those subjected to the red treatment. Highest bioactivity was 4 times greater than those obtained from greenhouse-grown plants. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) revealed a strong correlation between levels of several terpenoids and antimalarial activity, suggesting that these compounds might be involved in increasing antimalarial activity. CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrated a strategy to overcome the limitation of A. annua cultivation in Bangkok, Thailand. A specific LED spectrum that operated in a PFAL system promoted the accumulation of some useful phytochemicals in A. annua, leading to increased antimalarial activity. Therefore, the application of PFAL with appropriate light spectra showed promise as an alternative method for industrial production of A. annua or other useful medicinal plants with minimal environmental influence.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Artemisia annua L. (A. annua) is a traditional Chinese medicine that has been used since ancient times to treat malaria, eczema, dermatomycosis, jaundice, and boils. Modern pharmacological studies show that it has immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects. However, the mechanism of A. annua in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD) remains unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was aimed to investigate the effect of A. annua water extract (AWE) on 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB)-induced AD mouse model and tried to explore its possible underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AD was induced in BALB/c mice by the topical repeated application of DNCB. Oral drug intervention of AWE and dexamethasone (DEX, positive control) began from the 7th day and continued for 13 consecutive days. The clinical skin score, ear thickness and the weight of ear and spleen were assessed. The ear tissue were stained with toluidine blue and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to detect inflammatory cell infiltration. IgE, terleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 levels in the serum and IgE level in splenocytes were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The mRNA expression levels of IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) were measured by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. The phosphorylation levels of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)-p38 and nuclear factor (NF)-κB in ear tissue were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that AWE treatment significantly attenuated the AD-like symptoms in DNCB-induced BALB/c mice, including the skin dermatitis severity and ear edema. Further study disclosed that AWE treatment suppressed the expressions of IgE, IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, IL-17, TNF-α and TSLP at mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, AWE showed inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and NFκB in ear tissues of AD mice. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our results suggested that AWE suppressed DNCB-induced AD in mice probably by restraining Th2 type inflammatory response. These findings might pave the road for the potential clinical application of AWE for AD treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Novel Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is closely associated with cytokines storms. The Chinese medicinal herb Artemisia annua L. (A. annua) has been traditionally used to control many inflammatory diseases, such as malaria and rheumatoid arthritis. We performed network analysis and employed molecular docking and network analysis to elucidate active components or targets and the underlying mechanisms of A. annua for the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: Active components of A. annua were identified through the TCMSP database according to their oral bioavailability (OB) and drug-likeness (DL). Moreover, target genes associated with COVID-19 were mined from GeneCards, OMIM, and TTD. A compound-target (C-T) network was constructed to predict the relationship of active components with the targets. A Compound-disease-target (C-D-T) network has been built to reveal the direct therapeutic target for COVID-19. Molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation studies (MD), and MM-GBSA binding free energy calculations were used to the closest molecules and targets between A. annua and COVID-19. RESULTS: In our network, GO, and KEGG analysis indicated that A. annua acted in response to COVID-19 by regulating inflammatory response, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The molecular docking results manifested excellent results to verify the binding capacity between the hub components and hub targets in COVID-19. MD and MM-GBSA data showed quercetin to be the more effective candidate against the virus by target MAPK1, and kaempferol to be the other more effective candidate against the virus by target TP53. We identified A. annua's potentially active compounds and targets associated with them that act against COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that A. annua may prevent and inhibit the inflammatory processes related to COVID-19.",

      "abstract": "The biting midge Culicoides arakawae is the vector for the parasite Leucocytozoon caulleryi. Birds infected with L. caulleryi develop leucocytozoonosis. Given the food safety concern regarding drug residue in eggs, discovering a natural alternative to antibiotics is a worthy of exploration. Thus, we investigated the effects of the antimalarial herb Artemisia annua on experimentally induced leucocytozoonosis in chickens. We reared C. arakawae in the laboratory. Eggs were cultured, developing into larvae, pupae, and imagoes. Female midges sucked the blood of sick chickens and then were ground into a solution injected into healthy chickens. The control group was given empty capsules daily, whereas the 2 experimental groups were given 40 mg/kg sulfadimethoxine or 0.5 g of A. annua powder. Leucocytozoon gametocytes were detected in chicken blood through Giemsa staining. PCR detected the cytochrome b gene of L. caulleryi in the infected chickens. No significant among-group differences in body weight gain were observed before d 14 postinoculation (P > 0.05). Body weight gain in the control group was significantly lower from day 14 to 28 postinoculation (P < 0.05). After day 14, rectal temperature in the experimental groups decreased significantly compared with that in the control group. Lower rates of pale comb and green feces were observed in the animals receiving treatment from day 0. The experimental groups had a higher recovery rate and recovered earlier than did the control group. By day 31, all the animals had recovered. PCR detected L. caulleryi in the infected chickens with high sensitivity and accuracy. The animals receiving A. annua exhibited increased weight gain and reduced parasite concentrations in the blood. This in turn reduced mortality and the occurrence of pale comb and green feces. The findings are informative for research on leucocytozoonosis.",

Management of insulin resistance in T2DM without side effects of chemical drugs, is the ultimate goal of the medical community. Artemisia annua L. is used for the treatment of diabetes in folkloric medicine. The present study investigated the effects of aqueous and alcoholic extracts of A. annua (AA) on insulin resistance in high-fat diet/STZ-induced diabetic mice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Mice were divided into groups including control with a normal diet, un-treated high-fat diet/streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, and diabetic mice treated by oral administration of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg body weight of water (hot and cold) and alcoholic extracts of AA. After four weeks of treatment with AA, blood sampling was carried out to measure factors involved in insulin resistance such as low-density lipoprotein/ High-density lipoprotein (LDL/HDL) ratio, free fatty acids, Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) as an index of insulin resistance. RESULTS: The results showed that all AA extracts (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) and metformin (250 mg/kg) significantly reduced the serum levels of free fatty acids, TNF-alpha, IL-6, LDL/HDL ratio, and HOMA-IR in diabetic mice compared to untreated diabetic mice (p<0.0001). Notably, the 400 mg/kg dose of cold-water extract was more effective than metformin in reduction of TNF-alpha and IL-6 (p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively). CONCLUSION: These data illustrated that AA extracts attenuated insulin resistance by reducing the lipid profile and adipocytokines."

      "abstract": "As a medicinal plant, Artemisia annua L. is the main source of artemisinin in malaria drugs, but the lack of understanding of its distribution, environmental conditions and protection status limits the mass acquisition of artemisinin. Therefore, we used the ensemble forecast method to model the current and future global distribution areas of A. annua, evaluated the changes in suitable distribution areas on each continent under impacts of human activities and climate change, and its protection status on each continent in the corresponding period. The results showed that the main distribution areas of A. annua were concentrated in mid-latitudes in western and central Europe, southeastern Asia, southeastern North America and southeastern South America. Under the current climate scenario, human modifications have greatly reduced the suitable distribution area of A. annua, which was projected to expand inland with climate change and human socioeconomic impacts of CMIP6 in the future, but the effects of increasing temperature were different in different periods. Among all continents, the suitable distribution area in Europe was the most affected. However, at present and in the future, A. annua needs high priority protection on all continents. Asia and Europe have slightly better protection status scores than other continents, but the protection status scores of all continents are still very low. Our findings can be useful to guide development of protective measures for medicinal plants such as A. annua to further support drug production and disease treatment.",

This situation is particularly dramatic for Africa, which accounts for nearly 92% of malaria cases worldwide. Drug pressure has been identified as a key factor in the emergence of antimalarial drug resistance. Indeed, this pressure is favoured by several factors, including the use of counterfeit forms of antimalarials, inadequate prescription controls, poor adherence to treatment regimens, dosing errors, and the increasing use of other forms of unapproved antimalarials. This resistance has led to the replacement of chloroquine (CQ) by artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) which are likely to become ineffective in the coming years due to the uncontrolled use of Artemisia annua in the sub-Saharan African region for malaria prevention and COVID-19. The use of Artemisia annua for the prevention of malaria and COVID-19 could be an important factor in the emergence of resistance to Artemisinin-based combination therapies.",

This medicinal plant is effective against multiple pathogens and is used by many global communities as a source of artemisinin derivatives that are first-line drugs to treat malaria caused by Plasmodium parasites. AIM OF THE STUDY: The SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) global pandemic has killed millions and evolved numerous variants, with delta being the most transmissible to date and causing break-through infections of vaccinated individuals. We further queried the efficacy of A. annua cultivars against new variants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using Vero E6 cells, we measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of dried-leaf hot-water A. annua L. extracts of four cultivars, A3, BUR, MED, and SAM, to determine their efficacy against five infectious variants of the virus: alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), gamma (P.1), delta (B.1.617.2), and kappa (B.1.617.1). RESULTS: In addition to being effective against the original wild type (WT) WA1, A. annua cultivars A3, BUR, MED, and SAM were also potent against all five variants. IC50 and IC90 values based on measured artemisinin content ranged from 0.3 to 8.4 μM and 1.4-25.0 μM, respectively. The IC50 and IC90 values based on dried leaf weight (DW) used to make the tea infusions ranged from 11.0 to 67.7 μg DW and 59.5-160.6 μg DW, respectively. Cell toxicity was insignificant at a leaf dry weight of ≤50 μg in the extract of any cultivar. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that oral consumption of A. annua hot-water extracts (tea infusions) could potentially provide a cost-effective therapy to help stave off the rapid global spread of these variants, buying time for broader implementation of vaccines.",

      "abstract": "Artemisinin is currently the most effective ingredient in the treatment of malaria, which is thus of great significance to study the genetic regulation of Artemisia annua. Alternative splicing (AS) is a regulatory process that increases the complexity of transcriptome and proteome. The most common mechanism of alternative splicing (AS) in plant is intron retention (IR). However, little is known about whether the IR isoforms produced by light play roles in regulating biosynthetic pathways. In this work we would explore how the level of AS in A. annua responds to light regulation. We obtained a new dataset of AS by analyzing full-length transcripts using both Illumina- and single molecule real-time (SMRT)-based RNA-seq as well as analyzing AS on various tissues. A total of 5,854 IR isoforms were identified, with IR accounting for the highest proportion (48.48%), affirming that IR is the most common mechanism of AS. We found that the number of up-regulated IR isoforms (1534/1378, blue and red light, respectively) was more than twice that of down-regulated (636/682) after treatment of blue or red light. In the artemisinin biosynthetic pathway, 10 genes produced 16 differentially expressed IR isoforms. This work demonstrated that the differential expression of IR isoforms induced by light has the potential to regulate sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis. This study also provides high accuracy full-length transcripts, which can be a valuable genetic resource for further research of A. annua, including areas of development, breeding, and biosynthesis of active compounds."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Numerous efforts in natural product drug development are reported for the treatment of Coronavirus. Based on the literature, among these natural plants Artemisia annua L. shows some promise for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of our study was to determine artemisinin content by liquid chromatography electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS), to investigate the in vitro biological activity of artemisinin from the A. annua plants grown in Turkey with various extracted methods, to elaborate in silico activity against SARS-CoV-2 using molecular modelling. METHODOLOGY: Twenty-one different extractions were applied. Direct and sequential extractions studies were compared with ultrasonic assisted maceration, Soxhlet, and ultra-rapid determined artemisinin active molecules by LC-ESI-MS/MS methods. The inhibition of spike protein and main protease (3CL) enzyme activity of SARS-CoV-2 virus was assessed by time resolved fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay. RESULTS: Artemisinin content in the range 0.062-0.066%. Artemisinin showed significant inhibition of 3CL protease activity but not Spike/ACE-2 binding. The 50% effective concentration (EC50 ) of artemisinin against SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudovirus was found greater than 50 μM (EC45 ) in HEK293T cell line whereas the cell viability was 94% of the control (P < 0.01). The immunosuppressive effects of artemisinin on TNF-α production on both pseudovirus and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced THP-1 cells were found significant in a dose dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Further studies of these extracts for COVID-19 treatment will shed light to seek alternative treatment options. Moreover, these natural extracts can be used as an additional treatment option with medicines, as well as prophylactic use can be very beneficial for patients.",

      "abstract": "Artemisia annua and its phytocompounds have a rich history in the research and treatment of malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and other diseases. Currently, the World Health Organization recommends artemisinin-based combination therapy as the first-line treatment for multi-drug-resistant malaria. Due to the various research articles on the use of antimalarial drugs to treat coronaviruses, a question is raised: would A. annua and its compounds provide anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) properties? PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched for peer-reviewed articles that investigated the antiviral effects and mechanisms of A. annua and its phytochemicals against SARS-CoVs. Particularly, articles that evidenced the herb's role in inhibiting the coronavirus-host proteins were favored. Nineteen studies were retrieved. From these, fourteen in silico molecular docking studies demonstrated potential inhibitory properties of artemisinins against coronavirus-host proteins including 3CLPRO, S protein, N protein, E protein, cathepsin-L, helicase protein, nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3), nsp10, nsp14, nsp15, and glucose-regulated protein 78 receptor. Collectively, A. annua constituents may impede the SARS-CoV-2 attachment, membrane fusion, internalization into the host cells, and hinder the viral replication and transcription process. This is the first comprehensive overview of the application of compounds from A. annua against SARS-CoV-2/coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) describing all target proteins. A. annua's biological properties, the signaling pathways implicated in the COVID-19, and the advantages and disadvantages for repurposing A. annua compounds are discussed. The combination of A. annua's biological properties, action on different signaling pathways and target proteins, and a multi-drug combined-therapy approach may synergistically inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and assist in the COVID-19 treatment. Also, A. annua may modulate the host immune response to better fight the infection.",

Although effective against many infectious agents, the plant is not a miracle cure and there are infections where it has proved ineffective or limited. It is important to report those failures. METHODS: Here artemisinin, artesunate and dried leaf slurries of A. annua were used daily for 6 days in vivo against Babesia microti in mice 2 days post infection at 100 µg artemisinin/kg body weight. Parasitemia was measure before and 15 days days post treatment. Artemisinin and extracts of A. annua also were tested in vitro against six Candida sp. at artemisinin concentrations up to 180 µM and growth measured after cultures were fed drugs once at different stages of growth and also after repeated dosing. RESULTS: A. annua, artesunate, and artemisinin were ineffective in reducing or eliminating parasitemia in B. microti-infected mice treated at 100 µg artemisinin/kg body weight. Although the growth of exponential cultures of many of the tested Candida sp. was inhibited, the response was not sustained and both artemisinin and Artemisia were essentially ineffective at concentrations of artemisinin at up to 180 µM of artemisinin. CONCLUSIONS: Together these results show that artemisinin, its derivatives, and A. annua are ineffective against B. microti and at least six species of Candida."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has been declared as a global pandemic. Traditional medicinal plants have long history to treat viral infections. Our in silico approach suggested that unique phytocompounds such as emodin, thymol and carvacrol, and artemisinin could physically bind SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins (6VXX and 6VYB), SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 South Africa variant of Spike glycoprotein (7NXA), and even with ACE2 and prevent the SARS-CoV-2 binding to the host ACE2, TMPRSS2 and neutrapilin-1 receptors. Since Chloroquine has been looked as potential therapy against COVID-19, we also compared the binding of chloroquine and artemisinin for its interaction with spike proteins (6VXX, 6VYB) and its variant 7NXA, respectively. Molecular docking study of phytocompounds and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was performed by using AutoDock/Vina software. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed for 50ns. Among all the phytocompounds, molecular docking studies revealed lowest binding energy of artemisinin with 6VXX and 6VYB, with Etotal -10.5 KJ mol-1 and -10.3 KJ mol-1 respectively. Emodin showed the best binding affinity with 6VYB with Etotal -8.8 KJ mol-1and SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant (7NXA) with binding energy of -6.4KJ mol-1. Emodin showed best interactions with TMPRSS 2 and ACE2 with Etotal of -7.1 and -7.3 KJ mol-1 respectively, whereas artemisinin interacts with TMPRSS 2 and ACE2 with Etotal of -6.9 and -7.4 KJ mol-1 respectively. All the phytocompounds were non-toxic and non-carcinogenic. MD simulation showed that artemisinin has more stable interaction with 6VYB as compared to 6VXX, and hence proposed as potential phytochemical to prevent SARS-CoV-2 interaction with ACE-2 receptor.

Notably, the level of miR156 and several annotated miRNAs gradually decreased while SPLs increased. In addition, the genes on ART biosynthesis pathway were significantly upregulated including ADS, CYP71AV1, ADH1, DBR2 and ALDH1, and so were the positive transcription factors like AaERF1, AaORA and AaWRKY1 indicating that age influences the ART biosynthesis by activating the expression of the synthesizing genes as well as positive transcription factors.

Numerous studies about transcription factors positively regulating artemisinin biosynthesis have been published while negative regulators are rarely reported. In the present study, we identified AaMYB15 as the first R2R3-MYB that negatively regulates artemisinin biosynthesis in A. annua. Experimental evidences showed that AaMYB15 is a transcription factor within nucleus and predominantly expressed in glandular secretory trichomes (GSTs) in A. annua where artemisinin is synthesized and accumulated. The expression of AaMYB15 was induced by dark and JA treatment. Overexpression of AaMYB15 led to a significant decline in the expression levels of key enzyme genes ADS, CYP, DBR2, and ALDH1 and a significant decrease in the artemisinin contents of transgenic A. annua. AaMYB15 directly bound to the promoter of AaORA, a reported positive regulator of artemisinin biosynthesis in JA signaling pathway, to repress its transcriptional activity, thus downregulating the expression levels of downstream key enzyme genes and negatively regulating the artemisinin biosynthesis. Our study provides candidate gene for improvement of A. annua germplasm and new insights into the artemisinin biosynthesis regulation network mediated by light and JA.",

The current treatment for human babesiosis is suboptimal due to treatment failures and unwanted side effects. Although Babesia duncani was first described almost 30 years ago, further research is needed to elucidate its pathogenesis and clarify optimal treatment regimens. Here, we screened a panel of herbal medicines and identified Cryptolepis sanguinolenta, Artemisia annua, Scutellaria baicalensis, Alchornea cordifolia, and Polygonum cuspidatum to have good in vitro inhibitory activity against B. duncani in the hamster erythrocyte model. Furthermore, we found their potential bioactive compounds, cryptolepine, artemisinin, artesunate, artemether, and baicalein, to have good activity against B. duncani, with IC50 values of 3.4 μM, 14 μM, 7.4 μM, 7.8 μM, and 12 μM, respectively, which are comparable or lower than that of the currently used drugs quinine (10 μM) and clindamycin (37 μM). B. duncani treated with cryptolepine and quinine at their respective 1×, 2×, 4× and 8× IC50 values, and by artemether at 8× IC50 for three days could not regrow in subculture. Additionally, Cryptolepis sanguinolenta 90% ethanol extract also exhibited no regrowth after 6 days of subculture at doses of 2×, 4×, and 8× IC50 values. Our results indicate that some botanical medicines and their active constituents have potent activity against B. duncani in vitro and may be further explored for more effective treatment of babesiosis.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential active ingredients and underlying mechanisms of Artemisia annua (AA) on the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on network pharmacology. METHODS: In the present study, we used a network pharmacological method to predict its underlying complex mechanism of treating HCC. First, we obtained relative compounds of AA based on the traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology (TCMSP) database and collected potential targets of these compounds by target fishing. Then, we built HCC-related targets target by the oncogenomic database of hepatocellular carcinoma (OncoDB.HCC) and biopharmacological network (PharmDB-K) database. Based on the matching results between AA potential targets and HCC targets, we built a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to analyze the interactions among these targets and screen the hub targets by topology. Furthermore, the function annotation and signaling pathways of key targets were performed by Gene Oncology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis using DAVID tools. Finally, the binding capacity between active ingredients and key targets was validated by molecular docking. RESULTS: A total of 19 main active ingredients of AA were screened as target prediction; then, 25 HCC-related common targets were seeked out via multiple HCC databases. The areas of nodes and corresponding degree values of EGFR, ESR1, CCND1, MYC, EGF, and PTGS2 were larger and could be easily found in the PPI network. Furthermore, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis showed that these key targets were significantly involved in multiple biological processes and pathways which participated in tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, tumor invasion, and metastasis to accomplish the anti-HCC activity. The molecular docking analysis showed that quercetin could stably bind to the active pocket of EGFR protein 4RJ5 via LibDock. CONCLUSION: The anticancer effects of AA on HCC were predicted to be associated with regulating tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, tumor invasion, and metastasis via various pathways such as the EGFR signaling pathway, ESR1 signaling pathway, and CCND1 signaling pathway. It is suggested that AA might be developed as a broad-spectrum antitumor drug based on its characteristics of multicomponent, multipath, and multitarget."

      "abstract": "Artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone widely used in malaria treatment, was discovered in the medicinal plant Artemisia annua. The biosynthesis of artemisinin is efficiently regulated by jasmonate (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA) via regulatory factors. However, the mechanisms linking JA and ABA signalling with artemisinin biosynthesis through an associated regulatory network of downstream transcription factors (TFs) remain enigmatic. Here we report AaTCP15, a JA and ABA dual-responsive teosinte branched1/cycloidea/proliferating (TCP) TF, which is essential for JA and ABA-induced artemisinin biosynthesis by directly binding to and activating the promoters of DBR2 and ALDH1, two genes encoding enzymes for artemisinin biosynthesis. Furthermore, AaORA, another positive regulator of artemisinin biosynthesis responds to JA and ABA, interacts with and enhances the transactivation activity of AaTCP15 and simultaneously activates AaTCP15 transcripts. Hence, they form an AaORA-AaTCP15 module to synergistically activate DBR2, a crucial gene for artemisinin biosynthesis. More importantly, AaTCP15 expression is activated by the multiple reported JA and ABA-responsive TFs that promote artemisinin biosynthesis. Among them, AaGSW1 acts at the nexus of JA and ABA signalling to activate the artemisinin biosynthetic pathway and directly binds to and activates the AaTCP15 promoter apart from the AaORA promoter, which further facilitates formation of the AaGSW1-AaTCP15/AaORA regulatory module to integrate JA and ABA-mediated artemisinin biosynthesis. Our results establish a multilayer regulatory network of the AaGSW1-AaTCP15/AaORA module to regulate artemisinin biosynthesis through JA and ABA signalling, and provide an interesting avenue for future research exploring the special transcriptional regulation module of TCP genes associated with specialized metabolites in plants.",

Artemisia annua is an important crop plant used in the treatment of malaria. In this investigation, the physio-biochemical mechanisms involved in exogenous hydrogen sulphide-mediated (H2 S) alleviation of copper (Cu) stress in A. annua were assessed.. Two different levels of Cu (20, 40 mg·kg-1 ), one H2 S treatment (200 µm) and their combinations were introduced while one set of plants was retained as control. Results showed that the presence of excess Cu in the soil reduced growth and biomass, photosynthetic parameters, chlorophyll content and fluorescence, gas exchange parameters and induced antioxidant enzyme activity. Copper stress enhanced the production of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and increased Cu content in both roots and shoots of affected plants. Exogenous application of H2 S restored the physio-biochemical characteristics of Cu-treated A. annua plants by reducing lipid peroxidation and enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes in Cu-stressed plants as compared with the controls. Hydrogen sulphide also reduced the Cu content in different plant parts, increased photosynthetic efficiency, trichome density, average area of trichomes and artemisinin content. Therefore, our results provide a comprehensive assessment of the defensive role of H2 S in Cu-stressed A. annua.",

The species is widespread and known as a medicinal plant not only in Asia but also in Europe, in both Americas, and Australia. The species has become a subject of particular interest due to the 2015 Nobel Prize awarded for detecting the sesquiterpene lactone artemisinin in it and proving its antimalarial activities. The raw materials obtained from this species are Artemisiae annuae folium and Artemisiae annuae herba. The leaves are a raw material in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia and Vietnamese Pharmacopoeia. Both raw materials are in the International Pharmacopoeia published by the WHO. The main components of these raw materials are mainly specific sesquiterpene lactones, essential oil, flavonoids, coumarins, and phenolic acids. In traditional Asian medicine, the species is used, for example, in the treatment of jaundice and bacterial dysentery, as an antipyretic agent in malaria and tuberculosis, in the treatment of wounds and haemorrhoids, and in viral, bacterial, and autoimmune diseases. Professional pharmacological studies conducted today have confirmed its known traditional applications and explain previously unknown mechanisms of its biological action and have also found evidence of new directions of biological activity, including, among others, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antioxidant, antitumour, and nephroprotective activities. The species is of growing importance in the cosmetics industry.",

Thus, effective and safe drugs for this disease are not yet available. Artemisia annua L. is a medicinal plant with potent antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. In this study, we prepared a water extract of A. annua (WEAA) and examined its potential for NAFLD treatment. First, we pretreated HepG2 cells (human hepatocarcinoma cell line) with WEAA and then treated the cells with oleic acid or tert-butylhydroperoxide to examine the effect of WEAA on the lipid accumulation and the cytotoxicity, respectively. WEAA not only inhibited lipid accumulation within HepG2 cells but also protected cells from oxidative stress-mediated damage through the activation of antioxidant enzymes (such as activation of superoxide dismutase and production of glutathione) and its own scavenging activity. Next, to confirm protective effect of the WEAA in in vivo, mice were intragastrically administered with WEAA, extract of Silybum marianum or water once a day, and simultaneously provided with high-fat diet to induce fatty liver and hepatic steatosis. Oral administration of WEAA ameliorated weight gain and hepatic lipid accumulation in high-fat diet-fed mice. Moreover, the plasma levels of triglyceride, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase were reduced in the WEAA-treated group. Our findings indicated that WEAA may be a potential intervention for preventing or treating hepatic lipid accumulation and liver damage.",

AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the present study was to investigate the phytochemicals, antioxidants, antimicrobial and synergistic potential of methanolic and petroleum ether extracts of A. annua against bacterial and fungal pathogens. METHOD: Antioxidant activity of different concentrations of methanolic and petroleum ether extracts of A. annua was determined by DPPH free radical scavenging assay. Antimicrobial activity was determined by agar well diffusion, whereas MIC and synergistic activity was done by broth dilution method.TLC and GC-MS were done to identify active phytocompounds present in methanolic and petroleum ether extracts. RESULTS: Methanolic extract of A. annua showed higher antioxidant potential (IC50 37 0.75 ± 0.34 μg ml-1) as compared to petroleum ether extract. In antimicrobial analysis, methanolic and petroleum ether extracts of A. annua produced potent inhibitory activity against Candida strains as compared to bacterial strains. Methanolic and petroleum ether extracts of A. annua produced synergistic potential with decrease in MIC from 4 to 264 folds against bacterial (S. aureus and E. coli) and Candida strains in combination with antibacterial and antifungal antibiotics. Sub fraction I of methanolic and petroleum ether extracts was isolated through silica TLC and showed 10-fold more antimicrobial activity as compared to crude extract. GC-MS analysis of sub-fraction I of A. annua revealed 13 major phytocompounds with area more than 1%. Interestingly, 2-Propenoic acid and ridecyl ester (25.88%) were the major phytocompounds. CONCLUSION: Phytocompounds of A. annua can be used as bioenhancer of antibacterial and antifungal agents to control drug resistance.",

Artemisia annua L, a medicinal plant, well known for its antimalarial potential, was evaluated as a source of a type of essential oil collected during vegetative growth stage against Glyphodes pyloalis Walker. The main chemical components of the essential oil at vegetative stage of Artemisia annua was analyzed by GC- MS and contained 1,8-cineole (18.68%), Camphor (11.4%), α-Pinene (9.3%) and 3-Carene (6.3%). The LC50 of this plant oil was estimated to be 0.652% W/V and 2.585 μL/L air incorporated orally and fumigation, respectively. The digestive enzymes such as α-amylases, Proteases, Lipases and α- and β-glucosidases were considereably inhibited in treated larvae compared with controls. Similarly, the amount of protein, glucose, and triglyceride were decreased in the treated larvae by methods used. The lower hemocyte numbers, nodule formation and activity of phenoloxidases after injection of Beauveria bassiana and latex beads showed its EO effect on immunity. The anatomy of the larval midgut after treatment showed degeneration in digestive cells. Emerging adult's ovaries showed significant changes in the ovarian sheath and lack of yolk spheres.
