      "abstract": "Fibers were extracted from the pseudostem of the plantain of the variety Hartón, belonging to the order Zingiberales, family Musaceae, genus Musa, species Musa paradisiaca. The fibers were exposed to alkaline treatment to improve their physicomechanical properties for use as reinforcement in green composites. N a O H  solutions of 4 %, 5 %, and 6 % by weight were prepared. The fibers were immersed for 2 h in each solution. Fibers were washed with acetic acid to remove N a O H  residues and dried at room temperature. Weight loss and lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose content were evaluated. FTIR, tensile, and elongation tests were performed. SEM images and EDS mapping allowed to conclude the phenomena that occurred in the treatments. The untreated fibers obtained a tensile strength of 37.23 MPa, in contrast to 104.26 MPa obtained by the fibers treated with 5 % NaOH solution. It was concluded that the partial elimination of impurities and waxes improved the mechanical behavior of the fibers by 180 %. Regarding elongation, the fibers treated with 4 % NaOH solution obtained the best result with 3.7 %. It was determined that the partial elimination of lignin favors elongation by 48 %. Excessive hemicellulose removal was found to cause fibril separation and detachment. Considerable contraction of vascular bundles occurred. Roughness in the fibers surface topography were improved."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the probiotic potential of yeast isolates from banana and plantain peels. Yeast strains were isolated from ripe banana and plantain peels, using the standard procedures. Isolates that showed negativity for pathogenicity assays were used for in vitro and in vivo probiotic screening. For the in vivo assay, 30 male Wistar rats, divided into six treatment groups (five rats per treatment), were used. At the expiration of administration, the rats were euthanized for the estimation of yeast translocation and haematological parameters. A total of 16 yeasts were isolated, out of which, five (Hanseniaspora uvarum, Hanseniaspora lachancei, Hanseniaspora opuntiae and two species of Kodamaea ohmeri) isolates that showed negative results for pathogenicity assays were used for in vitro and in vivo assays. The study revealed the growth of the test yeast strains at the different incubation temperatures (25-45 °C) and pH (4-9). However, significantly highest growths were observed at pH 4 and 5 and NaCl concentration of 4%. All the isolates showed remarkable growth at the bile concentrations used. In addition, the strains showed resistance to the antibiotics and antimycotics at the concentration used for investigation. In vivo assay results showed no significant differences between weight gain, haematological parameters and behavioural scores between control and treatment groups of the rats. The ability of the yeasts to show tolerance to stress conditions and lack of negative impacts to haematological, behavioural and yeast translocations are indications of their probiotic capabilities."

      "abstract": "Plantain has been reported to enhance testicular function indices, however, the mechanism remains unknown. The present study investigated the action mechanisms of a plantain-based diet in the treatment of rat testicular dysfunction caused by exposure to atrazine (ATZ). The rats were grouped into 10 groups (5 rats each); control group, 50% plantain-based diet (50% PBD), 25% PBD, 12.5% PBD, quercetin (QUE), ATZ only, 50% PBD + ATZ, 25% PBD + ATZ, 12.5% PBD + ATZ, and QUE + ATZ for 21 days. Results revealed that ATZ treatments in rats lowered gonadal hormone levels and the semen quality (sperm concentration, motility, count, and viability), damaged testicular morphology and functions, and impaired redox-inflammatory balance as well as cholinergic and purinergic activities. However, treatment with PBD and QUE ameliorated the testicular toxicity induced by ATZ, although the treatment did not improve the rat semen quality. In addition, the ATZ + QUE and QUE groups showed mild to moderate atrophic degenerative changes, with reduced spermatogenic activity. Together, the results are evidence that 21 days of exposure to ATZ impaired testicular function. However, co-administration of atrazine and PBD improves rat gonadal hormones, redox state, inflammatory indices, cholinergic, and purinergic activities, as well as histoarchitecture of the testes.",

      "abstract": "Gluten-free diets are characterized by lower nutritional quality. The use of green plantain flour in gluten-free formulations appears as an alternative to overcome this deficiency, considering that green plantains have a relevant content of bioactive compounds, dietary fiber, including resistant starch. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of the addition of native and modified by hydrothermal treatment green plantain whole flours in the form of gluten-free cupcakes. The density, yield, and microstructure of the dough, specific volume (SV), height, crumb analysis, color, texture, and sensory acceptability of the cupcakes were evaluated. Partial replacement (40%) of rice flour by native and modified flours produced darker, redder cupcakes, less yellowish and with less color intensity. Sensory analysis revealed higher acceptance for cupcakes with native and modified flours, compared to the control, for appearance, flavor, texture, aroma, and overall acceptance. The native flour was the most viable option, as the cupcake produced with it showed the best values for hardness and chewiness, without changing elasticity and SV, in addition to superior sensory acceptance than the control and similar to cupcakes with other modified flours. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Pursuing to meet the market demand for gluten-free products, with the cake being one of the most requested products in this market, and taking in account that green banana, from different cultivars, has gained interest for the production of flours. The production of flour and bakery products is of great interest to the food industry, not only because of its flavor and properties but also due to the economic and sustainable viability of producing whole green plantain flour with the potential for application, promoting diversification and innovation in the gluten-free functional products market.",

      "abstract": "A plantain pseudostem was harvested and processed on the same day. The process began with manually separating the sheaths (80.85%) and the core (19.14%). The sheaths were subjected to a mechanical shredding process using paddles, extracting 2.20% of lignocellulosic fibers and 2.12% of sap, compared to the fresh weight of the sheaths. The fibers were washed, dried, combed, and spun in their native state and subjected to a steam explosion treatment, while the sap was subjected to filtration and evaporation. In the case of the core, it was subjected to manual cutting, drying, grinding, and sieving to separate 12.81% of the starch and 6.39% of the short lignocellulosic fibers, compared to the fresh weight of the core. The surface modification method using steam explosion succeeded in removing a low proportion of hemicellulose and lignin in the fibers coming from the shims, according to what was shown by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), achieving increased σmax and ε from the tensile test and greater thermal stability compared to its native state. The sap presented hygroscopic behavior by FT-IR and the highest thermal stability from TGA, while the starch from the core presented the lowest hygroscopic character and thermal stability. Although the pseudostem supplied two types of fibers, lower lignin content was identified in those from the core. Finally, the yarns were elaborated by using the fibers of the sheaths in their native and steam-exploded states, identifying differences in the processing and their respective physical and mechanical properties."

      "abstract": "Reports have shown that malachite green (MG) dye causes various hormonal disruptions and health hazards, hence, its removal from water has become a top priority. In this work, zinc oxide decorated plantain peels activated carbon (ZnO@PPAC) was developed via a hydrothermal approach. Physicochemical characterization of the ZnO@PPAC nanocomposite with a 205.2 m2/g surface area, porosity of 614.68 and dominance of acidic sites from Boehm study established the potency of ZnO@PPAC. Spectroscopic characterization of ZnO@PPAC vis-a-viz thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Powdered X-ray Diffraction (PXRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy and High Resolution - Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) depict the thermal stability via phase transition, functional group, crystallinity with interspatial spacing, morphology and spherical and nano-rod-like shape of the ZnO@PPAC heterostructure with electron mapping respectively. Adsorption of malachite green dye onto ZnO@PPAC nanocomposite was influenced by different operational parameters. Equilibrium data across the three temperatures (303, 313, and 323 K) were most favorably described by Freundlich indicating the ZnO@PPAC heterogeneous nature. 77.517 mg/g monolayer capacity of ZnO@PPAC was superior to other adsorbents compared. Pore-diffusion predominated in the mechanism and kinetic data best fit the pseudo-second-order. Thermodynamics studies showed the feasible, endothermic, and spontaneous nature of the sequestration. The ZnO@PPAC was therefore shown to be a sustainable and efficient material for MG dye uptake and hereby endorsed for the treatment of industrial effluent.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to quantify milk production and urinary nitrogen (UN) excretion of dairy cows grazing pastures containing varying amounts of plantain (Plantago lanceolata) in different seasons, under a typical farm practice. METHODS: Four pasture treatments: perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) - white clover (Trifolium repens) (RGWC), RGWC + low plantain rate, RGWC + medium plantain rate, and RGWC + high plantain rate, were established in four adaptation areas (1 ha each) and 20 experimental plots (800 m2 each), and rotationally grazed by dairy cows over 14 grazing events during two lactation years. In each grazing (8 to 9 days), 60 or 80 Jersey-Friesian lactation cows were assigned to their pasture treatments, adapted to their pastures over the first six days, then each group of 15 or 20 cows were randomly allocated for grazing in five treatment plots over a two or three-day measurement period. Milk, urine, and faecal samples were collected from individual cows during the measurement period. RESULTS: The pasture treatments did not affect milk production, the yield and composition of milk solids, protein, fat, and lactose. However, cows grazing pastures containing between 17% and 28% dietary plantain reduced UN concentration by 15% to 27%, decreased UN excretion by 4% to 9%, and increased urine volume by 22% to 40%, compared to grazing the RGWC pasture. The change in UN concentration, and urine volume were associated with plantain proportion in the diet and were greater during late summer and autumn than during early summer. CONCLUSION: Incorporating 17% to 28% dietary plantain with RGWC pastures can reduce the risk of nitrogen losses from pastoral systems, while maintaining the milk production of dairy cows."

      "abstract": "A completely biobased composite material was developed using a matrix of natural resin extracted from the Elaegia pastoensis Mora plant, commonly known as Mopa-Mopa or \"Barniz de Pasto\", reinforced with fibers extracted from plantain rachis agricultural residues. A solvent process, involving grinding, distillation, filtration, and drying stages, was implemented to extract the resin from the plant bud. To obtain the resin from the plant bud, the vegetable material was ground and then dissolved in a water-alcohol blend, followed by distillation, filtration, and grinding until the powdered resin was ready for use in the preparation of the biocomposite. Likewise, using mechanical techniques, the plantain rachis fibers were extracted and worked in their native condition and with a previous alkalinization surface treatment. Finally, the biocomposite material was developed with and without incorporating stearic acid, which was included to reduce the material's moisture absorption. Ultimately stearic acid was used as an additive to reduce biocomposite moisture absorption. The tensile mechanical results showed that the Mopa-Mopa resin reached a maximum strength of 20 MPa, which decreased with the incorporation of the additive to 12 MPa, indicating its plasticization effect. Likewise, slight decreases in moisture absorption were also evidenced with the incorporation of stearic acid. With the inclusion of rachis plantain fibers in their native state, a reduction in the tensile mechanical properties was found, proportional to the amount added. On the other hand, with the alkalinization treatment of the fibers, the behavior was the opposite, evidencing increases in tensile strength, indicating that the fiber modification improved the interfacial adhesion with the Mopa-Mopa matrix. On the other hand, the evaluation of the moisture absorption of the biocomposite material evidenced, as expected, that the absorption level was favored by the relative humidity used in the conditioning (47, 77, and 97%), which also had an impact on the decrease of the mechanical tensile properties, being this was slightly counteracted by the inclusion of stearic acid in the formulation of the material."

AIM OF THE STUDY: This study investigated the phytochemical composition, toxicity profile, wound healing, anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of aqueous Musa paradisiaca stem extract (AMPSE) in rats. METHODS: Phytochemical analysis of methanol-MPSE was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Acute toxicity testing was carried out through oral administration of a single dose of AMPSE up to 5 g/kg. Four separate groups of rats were used for the subacute toxicity testing (n = 6). Group 1 served as a normal control and did not receive AMPSE, groups 2-4 received AMPSE daily by gavage for 28 days. In the experiments with excision and incision wounds, the rats were treated with 10 w/w AMPS extract. The anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of AMPSE were assessed using egg albumin-induced paw oedema and acetic acid-induced writhing methods, respectively. For the subacute, anti-inflammatory and analgesic studies, AMPSE was administered to the experimental rats at doses of 300, 600 and 900 mg/kg body weight. RESULTS: Bioactive compounds identified include β-sitisterol, n-hexadecanoic acid, octadecanoic acid, diethyl sulfate, p-hydroxynorephedrine, phenylephrine, nor-pseudoephedrine, metaraminol, pseudoephedrine and vanillic acid. No signs of toxicity and no deaths were observed in all the groups. For the groups treated with AMPSE for 28 days, a significant reduction in alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, urea, sodium, chloride, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were observed while high density lipoprotein cholesterol, glutathione and superoxide dismutase increased compared to control (p < 0.05). In wound healing experiments, AMPSE showed greater percent wound contraction and wound resistance fracture compared to the povidone-iodine (PI) treated and control groups. Treatment with 900 mg/kg AMPSE resulted in significant (p < 0.05) anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects compared to the control. CONCLUSION: This study shows that AMPSE is not toxic but contains biologically active compounds with hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, lipid-lowering and wound-healing effects. Treatment of rats with AMPSE has shown that AMPSE has anti-inflammatory, analgesic, hepatoprotective, lipid-lowering and wound-healing effects, supporting its therapeutic use in ethnomedicine.",

Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), response surface method (RSM), and artificial neural network (ANN) were comparatively used in the simulation and modeling of the treatment process for improved biogas yield. Waste plantain peels were pretreated and used as substrate. FTIR and SEM results revealed that the pretreatment improved the substrate's desirable qualities. The amount of biogas yield was controlled by time, NaOH concentration, and temperature of the substrate pretreatment. Optimum pretreatment conditions obtained were a temperature of 102.7 °C, time of 31.7 min and NaOH concentration of 0.125 N. RSM, ANN, and ANFIS modeling techniques were proficient in simulating the biogas production, as evidenced by high R2values of 0.9281, 0.9850, and 0.9852, respectively. Furthermore, the values of the calculated error terms such as RMSE (RSM = 0.04799, ANN = 0.00969, and ANFIS = 0.00587) and HYBRID (RSM = 18.556, ANN = 0.803, and ANFIS = 0.0447) were low, indicating a satisfactory correlation between experimental and predicted values. Scrubbing of the biogas with caustic soda and activated charcoal increased the methane content to 94 %. The kinetics of the cumulative biogas yield were best fit with the Logistics and Modified Logistics models. The low C/N ratio in addition to the presence of potassium, nitrogen, and phosphorus suggested that the spent plantain peel slurry can be utilized as an agricultural fertilizer in crop production. The observations of this study therefore recommends the pre-treatment of biodigestion substrates as a key means to enhance beneficiation of methane production."

Common-plantain extracts were obtained by infusion and ultrasound extraction, and their total polyphenolic content and antioxidant capacity were determined by spectrophotometry. The best extract, which was obtained by infusion, was further encapsulated in sodium alginate in two different formulations. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to demonstrate the existing interactions in the obtained common-plantain extract in the alginate formulations. The encapsulation efficiency was evaluated based on the total polyphenol content. These alginate gel formulations were further used in vitro to determine their biocompatibility and antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects by spectrophotometry and ELISA, as well as their ability to stimulate fibroblast migration (scratch test assay) at different time points. In addition, the collagen 1 and 3 levels were determined by Western blot analysis. The data showed that the microencapsulated plantain extract formulations induced an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory effect, enhanced collagen production and increased wound closure in the first 8 h of their application. These results are encouraging for the use of this alginate plantain extract formulation as an adjuvant for skin wound healing."

      "abstract": "The consumption of unrefined vegetable oil poses acute and chronic health issues, yet improper disposal of waste plantain peels is not environmentally sustainable. This research investigates the feasibility, mechanism and thermodynamics of waste plantain peels, and commercial bentonite clay for soybean oil refining. Experiment was carried out using masses (1-4 g) of commercial bentonite clay, and unripe plantain peel ash (UPPA) to degummed and neutralized free fatty acid (FFA) contents in crude soybean oil at varying temperatures (50-120 °C), and time (15-35 min) for treatment of soybean oil. FTIR spectroscopy, SEM, and XRF techniques were applied to characterize the sample. The results established that at optimum 4.0 g dosage, the UPPA (97.73%) was more effective in the removal of FFA from oil at 50 °C and 20 min, while the clay (90%) was more effective in the removal of colour pigment from the vegetable oil 100 °C, and 25 min. The optimum efficiency of Clay-Ash-composite (70:30) in adsorbing pigment from soybean oil corresponds to 80%. The impact of changing viscosities, densities, and acid values on the performance of UPPA, clay, and clay-UPPA composite was investigated. Mechanistic studies confirmed the pseudo-second-order kinetics at 5 × 10-2 g/mg min-1 and 1.87 × 10-1 g/mg min-1, with corresponding adsorption capacity of 30.40 mg/g and 4.91 mg/g, at R2 ≤ 0.9982. The UPPA-driven sorption of FFA occurred as a physisorption and exothermic process (- 620.60 kJ/mol), while colour pigment removal occurred by chemisorption and endothermic process (22.40 kJ/mol). The finding recommends UPPA and composite as economically feasible for refining soybean oil.",

The experiment was carried out to evaluate the potential of dried unripe plantain peel and Tithonia diversifolia as soil amendments and its effect on growth, yield and fruit quality of tomato. Four rates each of dried plantain peel (0, 5, 10 and 15 t/ha) and Tithonia diversifolia (0, 10, 20 and 30 t/ha) were applied sole and combined. The experimental layout was a completely randomized design (CRD) with three replicates. Parameters were collected on the plant height, number of leaves, number of branches, stem girth, yield and fruit quality. Data collected were subjected to Analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the GENSTAT Discovery Software, Edition 4. Comparison of the treatment means were carried out using Duncan Multiple range test (DMRT) at 0.05 level of probability. Results showed that dried plantain peel and Tithonia diversifolia improved, number and weight of fruits as well as the fruit quality of tomato and were comparable to the application of NPK fertilizer. Treatment P5T30 (T8) increased number of leaves and number of branches while P15T20 (T15) and P10T30 (T12) increased plant height and stem girth respectively. Treatment P5T30 (T8) and P10T20 (T11) also significantly improved the fruit quality (minerals, lycopene and Vit. A) of tomato fruits. It can therefore be concluded that application of dried plantain peel and Tithonia diversifolia at P5T30 (T8) and P10T20 (T11) increased the vegetative, yield and quality parameters of tomato in the screen house of the study area."

      "abstract": "Exposure to the herbicide atrazine (ATZ) has deleterious effects on male fertility. This fact underscores the need for measures to protect against the detrimental impact of atrazine exposure on male fertility. The study assessed the protective effects of plantain-based diet (PBD) on rat testes exposed to ATZ by exploring oxid-inflammatory homeostasis. The study evaluated the preventive and therapeutic effects of PBD in a two-phased experiment. Male rats were randomized into seven groups for therapeutic model (Control, ATZ only, ATZ recovery, ATZ + 50% PBD, ATZ + 25% PBD, ATZ + 12.5% PBD and ATZ + quercetin-QUE) while the preventive model had ten groups (Control, ATZ, 50% PBD + ATZ, 25% PBD + ATZ, 12.5% PBD + ATZ and QUE + ATZ). The oxidative stress parameters (DNA fragmentation and MDA level), purinergic activity (ATPase), acetylcholine esterase, and inflammatory markers (NO level, MPO activity, and TNF-α) were increased while the Nrf2 levels were decreased by the ATZ treatment. However, the PBD was able to restore the oxido-inflammatory parameters in the rat testes. The chemical fingerprint of the diet revealed that the diets contained 16 bioactive compounds with quercetin being the most prominent compound. Overall, treatment with PBD was able to protect and prevent the toxicity caused by ATZ by modulating the redox and inflammatory status as well as purinergic activity in the rat testes.",

      "abstract": "Dairy cow urine patches contain high rates of nitrogen (N; >500 kg N/ha) and represent the main source of N loss from grazed pastoral systems. Emerging research has identified plantain (Plantago lanceolata) as a key forage to potentially reduce urine N (UN) losses from dairy cows. This experiment examined the effect of increasing proportions of plantain in the diet of dairy cows on UN excretion relative to a ryegrass-white clover diet. Twenty mixed aged non-lactating dairy cows were randomly assigned to one of five treatment diets; 0 %, 20 %, 40 %, 60 % or 100 % plantain (dry matter basis), with the remainder comprised of ryegrass-white clover pasture and grass-silage. Cows were fitted with urine sensors to measure urination event N concentration, volume and frequency. Daily N intake increased with increasing proportions of plantain in the diet due to the greater N concentration of plantain. Conversely, mean UN concentration was reduced as the proportion of plantain in the diet increased. Urine-N concentration was >40 % lower for cows on 100 % plantain compared with 0 % plantain (0.46 and 0.81 % N respectively). There was no treatment effect on the total daily amount of UN excreted, indicating a dilution effect of plantain as total daily urine volumes markedly increased with increasing plantain diets. Nitrogen load per urination event was lower for cows on 100 % plantain than 0 % despite greater N intake, with no significant difference for the intermediate treatment groups. The reduced N load per event for cows on >60 % plantain could help to reduce N leaching losses at the urine patch level. This experiment suggests that a reduction in UN concentration can be achieved on low levels of plantain (20 % of the diet), but >60 % plantain diets are required to reduce N load per event.",

      "abstract": "Industrialization and urbanization have caused a hike in all forms of emissions, many of which have detrimental effects on plants, animals, the environment, and worse still, humans. In a quest for novel products (household, and medical), manufacturing industries work tirelessly worldwide using metals to meet man's needs. However, such metals especially those confined to this research (Hg, Cd, and Pb) are inherently hazardous to not just the environment but human life and existence. Thirty (30) male Wistar rats divided into six groups of five rats each was used for the study. Stock solutions of the heavy metals were prepared and the required dose calculated according to individual weight and administered as such to group 2-5, plantain stem juice (PSJ) was administered to groups 3 to 5 in increasing dose after receiving the HMM (heavy metal mixture) while group six received medium-dose of PSJ used in the study only. Bodyweight of the rats was monitored once in three weeks while the feed and fluid intake were monitored thrice a week. At the end of the ninth week, the animals were weighed and sacrificed. Organs of interest (brain, heart, lungs, and thymus) were harvested and analyzed. Analysis done include Histopathology, hematological, biochemical, and organs/blood metal concentration. The results obtained showed a decline in the weight of animals that received metal mixture only when compared to normal control and PSJ treated groups. This could be traceable to the decline in feed intake of the metal-induced groups. However, no significant effect was observed in the histology of the Thymus and cerebellum even though the presence of a vacuole in the cerebral cortex indicated an anomaly. The histology of the heart and the lungs showed some level of distortion which was ameliorated dose-dependently with the administration of PSJ. Interestingly, after a decrease in the antioxidant level upon administration of metal mixture, a booster effect was observed with an increasing dose of PSJ. In conclusion, the recent findings have demonstrated that treatment with PSJ in HMM induced intoxication has a significant role in protecting the animals from all possible organ toxicity by modulating hemato-biochemical parameters and oxidative stress level."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Great plantain (Plantago major L. or P.major) is a medicinal plant that is available all around the world. The whole plant has several bioactive compounds including terpenoids, flavonoids, phenolic compounds, alkaloids, fatty acids, iridoid glycosides, polysaccharides, and vitamins. Scientific studies have recognized several medical benefits like wound healing, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiulcerative, and antioxidative agents. The wound-healing capacity of this plant has been investigated under in vivo and ex vivo conditions. In the current study, we aim to compare the therapeutic effect of the P.major extract with 1% sulfadiazine on the healing of second-degree burn wounds. METHOD: Second-degree burn victims were included in our study. The investigation and control group, respectively, received P. major ointment 10% and silver sulfadiazine ointment 1%. The bacterial culture from the wound site was taken on days 3, 7, 10, 13, and last day of hospitalization. Patients' subjective complaints were obtained through the visual analog scale (VAS). All patients were treated and evaluated in the hospital. RESULT: Among the 15 patients, 11 were male, and the mean age was 33.3 years. The average complete healing duration was 11.73 vs. 13 days in the P. major and control group, respectively (P=0.166). On the third day, infection control was similar between the two groups, and on the seventh day, all bacterial cultures were negative. Although there was a significant reduction in pain scores during the recovery time, no significant differences in pain reduction were noted between the two groups (P=0.849). CONCLUSION: We showed that P.major ointment is a safe and suitable herbal compound in the treatment of second-degree burn wounds that not only has wound-healing properties but also is an analgesic and antimicrobial compound.",

      "abstract": "This study focused on the effect of unripe (UPP) and ripe (RPP) plantain peels' extracts (200 and 400 mg/kg) on sexual behavior, hormonal profiles [testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH)], and enzymes [acetylcholinesterase (AChE), phosphodiesterase-5' (PDE-5), arginase, angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE), ecto-5'neucleotidase, and adenosine deaminase (ADA)] in paroxetine (PAR)-induced penile dysfunction rats. From the result, arginase, PDE-5', ACE, ecto-5'-nucleotidase ADA, and AChE activities, sexual activities, hormonal profile, and NO level were reduced, while thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) level increased (p < .05) relative to normal control rats. However, treatment with UPP and URP reduced the activities of these enzymes, decreased TBARS levels, and increased hormones, and penile NO levels in PAR-induced rats. Thus, the use of UPP and RPP could be channeled towards the improvement of sexual performance in erectile dysfunction (ED) disorder. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Plantain fruits are a tropical staple food crop commonly consumed at various stages of ripeness and cooking methods. However, its peels are regarded as a waste product with reported cases of environmental menace. Interestingly, plantain peel is being used as a major raw material for industrial applications in the agro-based industries and in folklore for the treatment of many human ailments due to its rich phytochemicals such as polyphenols, carotenoids, alkaloids, etc., which have been reported. A prelude study has also indicated its usefulness in ED management, but further pharmacological investigations are needed to proffer information on its effect in ED management and its anti-androgenic activity in male Wistar rats. The information from this study could be of pharmaceutical importance in designing natural remedies capable of improving penile rigidity, hormone profiles, and alteration of enzymes linked with ED.",

      "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Adhesion of this Gram-positive pathogen to the intestinal epithelium is a crucial step in CDI, with recurrence and relapse of disease dependent on epithelial interaction of its endospores. Close proximity, or adhesion of, hypervirulent strains to the intestinal mucosa are also likely to be necessary for the release of C. difficile toxins, which when internalized, result in intestinal epithelial cell rounding, damage, inflammation, loss of barrier function and diarrhoea. Interrupting these C. difficile-epithelium interactions could therefore represent a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent and treat CDI. Intake of dietary fibre is widely recognised as being beneficial for intestinal health, and we have previously shown that soluble non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) from plantain banana (Musa spp.), can block epithelial adhesion and invasion of a number of gut pathogens, such as E. coli and Salmonellae. Here, we assessed the action of plantain NSP, and a range of alternative soluble plant fibres, for inhibitory action on epithelial interactions of C. difficile clinical isolates, purified endospore preparations and toxins. We found that plantain NSP possessed ability to disrupt epithelial adhesion of C. difficile vegetative cells and spores, with inhibitory activity against C. difficile found within the acidic (pectin-rich) polysaccharide component, through interaction with the intestinal epithelium. Similar activity was found with NSP purified from broccoli and leek, although seen to be less potent than NSP from plantain. Whilst plantain NSP could not block the interaction and intracellular action of purified C. difficile toxins, it significantly diminished the epithelial impact of C. difficile, reducing both bacteria and toxin induced inflammation, activation of caspase 3/7 and cytotoxicity in human intestinal cell-line and murine intestinal organoid cultures. Dietary supplementation with soluble NSP from plantain may therefore confer a protective effect in CDI patients by preventing adhesion of C. difficile to the mucosa, i.e. a \"contrabiotic\" effect, and diminishing its epithelial impact. This suggests that plantain soluble dietary fibre may be a therapeutically effective nutritional product for use in the prevention or treatment of CDI and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea."

      "abstract": "Chloroquine has been reported as an effective drug for the treatment of COVID-19 and with the rise in its administration and continued use, metabolites of chloroquine invariably find their way into the environment. There are many concerns recently on the presence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment, hence the need for environmental remediation via effective adsorbent. Plantain peel activated carbon-supported zinc oxide (PPAC-ZnO) nanocomposite was prepared and characterized using physicochemical and spectroscopic techniques. The rate of uptake of chloroquine by PPAC-ZnO nanocomposite was investigated by batch technique under different operational parameters. PPAC-ZnO nanocomposite was characterized by various physicochemical techniques by SBET = 606.07 m2g-1, pH(pzc) = 4.98 surface area by Saer's method = 273.4 m2g-1. The carboxylic, phenols, lactone, and basic sites were determined by the Boehm method. Chloroquine uptake was confirmed by FTIR and SEM before and after adsorption. Change in morphology after adsorption was revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed the crystallinity of PPAC-ZnO nanocomposite. The batch adsorption experiment results showed that adsorption capacity increased with an increase in temperature. The maximum chloroquine sorption was 78.89% at a concentration of 10 ppm and a temperature of 313 K. Equilibrium sorption fitted well to Langmuir and Temkin isotherms with a high correlation coefficient (R 2) of 0.99. Pseudo-second-order best described the kinetic data and adsorption mechanism was pore diffusion dependent. Thermodynamics parameters (ΔG =  - 25.65 to - 28.79 kJmol-1; ΔH = 22.06 kJmol-1 and ΔS = 157.69 Jmol-1) demonstrated feasibility, spontaneity, and endothermic behavior of the process with degrees of randomness. The activation energy for adsorption was less than 40 kJmol-1 suggesting a physisorption mechanism. This study results revealed that PPAC-ZnO nanocomposites are a sustainable and effective adsorbent for the removal of pharmaceutical waste."

The highest levels of amylose, water-holding capacity (WHC), and oil-holding capacity (OHC) were observed in unripe flours and acid-treated flour recorded the highest content of resistant starch (RS). Flour after pre-blanching contained the highest level of total phenolic (TP), carotenoid contents, and browning index (BI) value. In contrast, acid-treated flours had the lowest BI value. As ripening progressed, peak viscosity and breakdown values increased but final viscosity, setback, and pasting temperature values were reduced. Untreated flour samples showed the highest peak viscosity. Higher breakdown values were found in acid-treated samples and higher setback values in pre-blanched samples."

Obtained results show that all analysed THMP with P. lanceolata L., folium available in the Polish pharmacies contain cadmium impurities, but at a very low level (ranged 0.73 - 20.6 μg/L). The content of Cd in a single dose (ng/single dose) is also very low and is not a threat to patients. The estimated maximum daily exposure (ng/day) of Cd based on the 'worst-case scenario' (maximum concentrations by oral administration) meets the standards of ICH Q3D guideline (all results were below oral permitted daily exposure; PDE for Cd, i.e. < 5.0 µg/day). It can be concluded that all analysed samples of THMP with P. lanceolata L., folium should not represent any health hazard to the patients due to cadmium levels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study about Cd impurity level in THMP with P. lanceolata L., folium (ribwort plantain leaves) available in European pharmacies.",

      "abstract": "Plantain (Plantago lanceolata) and chicory (Cichorium intybus) are now widely used in combination with clover species to provide greater annual lamb live weight gains than perennial ryegrass and white clover pasture. Reported selective grazing of the species in herb-clover mixes could potentially detrimentally change the relative abundance of species and decrease lamb production. Lambs were offered three herbage treatments: Pasture (perennial ryegrass and white clover) mix, plantain (plantain, red clover and white clover) mix and a chicory (chicory, plantain, red clover and white clover) mix in each of four seasons for two years. The experiment was a randomized complete block design with three replicates with 18-30 lambs per treatment replicate depending on the season. Lambs were rotationally grazed and fed ad libitum. Selection by the lambs of individually tagged plants within the pasture treatments was observed for three days on two occasions per season. Red clover was the most selected species on day 1, but by day 3 there was no difference in the selection of the species (p < 0.05). Plantain and chicory in the plantain and chicory mixes were selected less on day 1 in autumn relative to the other seasons (p < 0.05). It was concluded that three days of grazing before moving lambs maintained the relative abundance of species in the herb-clover mixes."

In this scenario, water-deficit-tolerant species such as plantain and chicory are interesting alternatives for use in sheep production systems. In this study, we compared a mixture of plantain and chicory herbage (PCH) with a grass-based permanent sward (GBS) on the weight gain and meat quality of lambs finished on these grasslands. Fifteen weaned lambs (31.3 kg and 4 months of age) were assigned to each treatment for seven weeks in late spring and live weight gain (LWG), carcass and meat quality were evaluated. There was a tendency (p = 0.09) in final weight (40.3 ± 0.8 kg) and live weight gain (173 ± 10 g/d) to be higher in PCH compared to GBS. Carcass weight, dressing percentage and meat quality in terms of pH, color and tenderness did not differ (p > 0.05) and were considered to be of good quality. We concluded that both swards result in comparable lamb performance and good meat quality."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The incidence of gout and hyperuricemia is increasing year by year in the world. Plantain is a traditional natural medicine commonly used in the treatment of gout and hyperuricemia, but the molecular mechanism of its active compounds is still unclear. Based on network pharmacology, this article predicts the targets and pathways of effective components of plantain for gout and hyperuricemia and provides effective reference for clinical medication. METHOD: Traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology database and analysis platform (TCMSP) and SymMap databases were used to screen out the active compounds and their targets in plantain. GeneCards, Therapeutic Target Database (TTD), and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) databases were used to find the targets corresponding to gout and hyperuricemia. Venn diagram was used to obtain the intersection targets of plantain and diseases. The interaction network of the plantain active compounds-targets-pathways-diseases was constructed by using Cytoscape 3.7.2 software. Finally, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were carried out. RESULT: Seven active compounds were identified by network pharmacological analysis, including dinatin, baicalein, baicalin, sitosterol, 6-OH-luteolin, stigmasterol, and luteolin. Plantain plays a role in gout and hyperuricemia diseases by regulating various biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. The core targets of plantain for treating gout are MAPK1, RELA, TNF, NFKBIA, and IFNG, and the key pathways are pathways in cancer, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway, interleukin (IL)-17 signaling pathway, Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis), and relaxin signaling pathway. The core targets of plantain for hyperuricemia are RELA, MAPK1, NFKBIA, CASP3, CASP8, and TNF, and the main pathways are pathways in cancer, apoptosis, hepatitis B, IL-17 signaling pathway, and toxoplasmosis. CONCLUSION: This study explored the related targets and mechanisms of plantain for the treatment of gout and hyperuricemia from the perspective of network pharmacological analysis, reflecting the characteristics of multiple components, multiple targets, and multiple pathways, and it provides a good theoretical basis for the clinical application of plantain."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Worldwide distributed plantains (genus Plantago L.) are extensively used in the traditional, but some of them are also accepted in the modern medicine. Wide range of usages is mainly connected to the inflammation processes. AIM OF THE STUDY: To support usage of renowned P. lanceolata L. and P. major L., underinvestigated P. altissima L., P. argentea Chaix, P. holosteum Scop. and P. media L. methanol extracts, and their typical constituents (aucubin, apigenin, apigenin-7-O-glucoside, luteolin, luteolin-7-O-glucoside, chlorogenic and ursolic acid) in treatment of inflammation disorders, we conducted study on plantain potential to inhibit production of inflammatory mediators, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2). MATERIALS AND METHODS: LPS-stimulated monocytes (U937 cell line) were used as a model-system to examine anti-inflammatory potential of plantains and their constituents. Produced PGE2 and TXA2 were quantified by LC-MS/MS; qPCR was applied to examine related gene (PLA2, COX-1, COX-2, mPGES-1, mPGES-2, cPGES, TXAS) expression; LC-MS/MS and LC-UV/VIS techniques to analyze extracts composition. RESULTS: In general, examined plantain extracts showed comparable inhibition activity of PGE2 and TXA2 production as aspirin at low-dose concentration. Underinvestigated P. altissima can be pointed out, since it exerted the strongest effect on both PGE2 production and related gene expression. Notable suppression of TXA2 production by P. lanceolata and P. major was observed. But, PCA analysis showed no obvious grouping, implicating that different mechanisms of action are responsible for each sample activity. In most cases, positive correlation was found between content of apigenin and ursolic acid and extracts suppression of PGE2 and TXA2 production and related genes expression. CONCLUSIONS: P. altissima can be regarded as promising anti-inflammatory agent, while novel aspect of P. lanceolata and P. major application (anti-aggregation) can be suggested. P. argentea and P. media could be considered as a good source of ursolic acid.",

      "abstract": "More than 1.3 billion tons, a third of the total food produced, is wasted annually, and it has been predicted to increase in the coming years. Food waste significantly contributes to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions resulting in the release of about 3.3 billion tonnes of CO2 into the environment yearly. Hence this large amount of wastes, with adverse environmental effects, needs to be appropriately managed. New technologies such as Anaerobic digestion, fermentation, and gasification are being used to produce renewable energy, which in turn reduces the increasing level of food wastes in the environment. Pyrolysis of biomass materials or food wastes produces high-value energy products or bio-oil that can possibly replace non-renewable fossil fuels when it is upgraded. In this study, pyrolysis (thermal treatment in the absence of oxygen) of plantain and yam peels to produce bio-oil, was investigated. The pyrolysis conditions, wide temperature ranges at an interval of 100 °C (200-700 °C), absence of a catalyst (AOC), the use of zeolite -Y catalyst using two separate heterogeneous catalysis procedures were imposed and used to produced bio-oil. In the first procedure, the pyrolysis gases were allowed to rise through a zeolite-Y catalyst bed (HTC). And in the second procedure, the plantain or yam peel feedstock was first mixed uniformly with the zeolite-Y catalyst before pyrolysis (HMC). The GC-MS machine was used to analyze or characterize the obtained bio-oil while proximate analysis and XRF machine were used to characterize the plantain and yam peels feed. The residue, biochar, from the pyrolysis process, was also characterized using the XRF machine."

Fish (mean weight 36.56 ± 1.99 g) were fed a diet supplemented with an aqueous methanolic extract of RP at variable doses, 0 (control), 1 (RP1), 2 (RP2), and 3 g kg-1 (RP3) for 90 days. The final weight, weight gain, and specific growth rate were significantly increased in RP1, RP2, and RP3 treatment groups compared to that of the control. Among examined blood parameters, hemoglobin value in RP1 group (9.77 ± 0.10 g dl-1) only was significantly high on the 30th day of the study. When immune response parameters were evaluated, we observed that oxidative radical production and lysozyme activities were affected positively in experimental groups (P < 0.05). The highest oxidative radical production was determined in fish of RP3 group. Glutathione peroxidase and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase were increased in RP3 group compared to control and other treatment groups. Based on these results, it is concluded that ribwort plantain promotes growth, enhances immune responses and antioxidant enzyme activities in rainbow trout, and therefore, may be used in aquaculture.",

      "abstract": "Plantain and chicory are interesting forage species since they present good nutritional quality and are more resistant to drought than many temperate grasses. The fatty acid (FA) profile in milk and meat is related to a growing concern for the consumption of healthy foods, that is, with a lower content of saturated FA, higher polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) and a favourable n-6 : n-3 FAs ratio. Our objective was to evaluate the FA content in ewe's milk and lamb's meat fed a plantain-chicory mixture (PCH) or a grass-based permanent sward (GBS) dominated by perennial ryegrass. Eighteen Austral ewes in mid-lactation were allocated to PCH and GBS treatments. Milk samples were obtained during September (spring). Thirty weaned lambs were finished on both treatments from November to December (7 weeks), slaughtered and their meat sampled. Fat from milk and meat samples was extracted and stored until analysed by gas chromatography. Milk fat from GBS was higher than from PCH (P < 0.05) in C18:0 (11 385 v. 5874 mg/100 g FA), 9c-18:1 (15 750 v. 8565 mg/100 g FA), 11 t-18:1 (4576 v. 2703 mg/100 g FA) and 9c,11 t-18:2 (1405 v. 921 mg/100 g FA) and lower in 18:2n-6 (827 v. 1529 mg/100 g FA) and 18:3n-3 (943 v. 1318 mg/100 g FA) FA. Total mono-unsaturated FA was higher in GBS than PCH (P < 0.05). Meat fat from PCH swards presented a higher (P < 0.05) content than GBS for 18:2n-6 (46.8 v. 28.2 mg/100 g FA), linolenic (24.6 v. 14.2 mg/100 g FA), polyunsaturated FA (119.7 v. 73.4 mg/100 g FA), n-6 (65.9 v. 40.8 mg/100 g FA) and n-3 (53.8 v. 32.5 mg/100 g FA), respectively. No effect of treatment (P > 0.05) was detected for 9c-18:1 (283.9 v. 205.8 mg/100 g FA), 11 t-18:1 (26.2 v. 19.3 mg/100 g FA) and 9c,11 t-18:2 (10.1 v. 7.6 mg/100 g FA), for PCH and GBS. These results suggest that grazing a PCH mixture results in a higher concentration of PUFA in ewes' milk and in lambs' fat, as compared to a GBS sward.",

      "abstract": "There is a growing interest in the development of functional ingredients, including those with high indigestible carbohydrate content. Unripe plantain flour (UPF) is a source of indigestible carbohydrates, type II resistant starch (RS) in particular. A major drawback of UPF, however, is that its RS content decreases sharply after wet heat treatment. Here, we explore the possibility of preparing an extruded UPF-based functional ingredient that retains limited starch digestibility features and high dietary fiber content. Both an unripe plantain pulp flour (UPFP) and a whole (pulp and peel) unripe plantain flour (UPFW) were prepared, extruded under identical conditions and evaluated for their gelatinization degree, total starch (TS), resistant starch (RS), and total dietary fiber (TDF) content; functional properties, such as pasting profile, water retention capacity, and solubility, and oil absorption index were also analyzed. The extruded functional ingredient was added to a yogurt and the rheological characteristics and in vitro starch digestibility of the product were evaluated. The extruded UPFW showed a lower gelatinization degree than the extruded UPFP, which may be due to the higher non-starch polysaccharide content of the former. A high TDF content was recorded in both extrudates (12.4% in UPFP and 18.5% in UPFW), including a significant RS fraction. The water retention capacity and solubility indices were higher in the extruded flours, particularly in UPFW, while only marginal differences in oil retention capacity were observed among the products. The addition of UPFP or UPFW (1.5 g TDF, w/v) to a yogurt did not alter the viscosity of the product, an important characteristic for the consumer's approval. Moreover, the composite yogurt showed a relatively low starch digestion rate. Extrusion of UPFs may be an alternative for the production of functional ingredients with important DF contents."

These prepared carbons were characterized for instrumental studies such as BET, FTIR, XRD, SEM with EDS and TGA to understand the chemistry and modification. The determination of IEP and pHZPC established the presence of positive surface sites on the virgin (VMPC) and Ti-modified (TiMPC) carbons to facilitate the sorption of fluoride. The fluoride removal efficiency as a function of time, pH, dose, initial fluoride concentration, temperature, and co-ion intervention was studied. The maximum fluoride removal of about 81.2 and 97.7% was achievable with VMPC and TiMPC, respectively, after 20 min at the pH of 2.04 and continued for the equilibrium of 60 min. Temperature was found to be influential both by way of initial increase followed by a decrease in the fluoride uptake of MPCs. Regeneration was very consistent up to 7 cycles with the residual fluoride concentration below the WHO guide line of 1.5 mg L-1. Highest intervention due to hydrogen carbonate ions was observed during the fluoride removal process. Kinetic (pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and intra-particle diffusion) and isotherm models (Langmuir, Freundlich, and DKR) were checked for their compliance with the present sorption system. These low temperature synthesized MPCs are found to be effective candidates in the process of fluoride abatement in water.",

      "abstract": "Plants have been used since antiquity to treat and prevent diseases. Plantain (Plantago lanceolata L.) is traditionally used for the treatment of the common cold and associated symptoms such as cough. This study was designed to evaluate the oral toxicity of plantain leaf extract-containing syrup. In preparation of the toxicological examination and to ensure the quality of the herbal preparation, analytical methods were developed and validated, and stability testing was performed. Physicochemical and microbial quality, thin layer chromatography patterns and high performance liquid chromatography fingerprints complied with the specifications during the entire period of stability testing. The marker substance, acteoside, remained within the stability-defining limits of 90%-110% for quantitative determinations. No hint of toxicity emerged from 14-day repeat dose toxicity testing in rats. The animals were given doses of 3, 6, or 12 mL of syrup per kg body weight by gavage twice daily. All animals showed normal appearance and behavior. Body and organ weights at the end of the study were similar to those in the control group. Overall, P. lanceolata syrup was found to be stable and non-toxic under the test conditions."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The impact of high-pressure processing (HPP) on the polyphenol (PP) content and antioxidant activity (AOX) of plantain pulp was evaluated. Pressures of 400, 500 and 600 MPa were applied to plantain pulp for 90 and 180 s at room temperature (25 °C). Polyphenoloxidase activity, extractable (EPP) and non-extractable PP (NEPP) contents, flavonoid content and AOX (FRAP, ABTS•+ ) were evaluated. In addition, PP identification was performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Polyphenoloxidase activity was inhibited after HPP under all of the conditions studied. Increases of 110.80% and 137.40% in EPP content under conditions of 500 MPa/180 s and 600 MPa/90 s were observed with a simultaneous improvement in the AOX with increments of up to 128.71%. The treatment under conditions of 500 MPa/90 s had the highest total PP content, including the highest content of flavonoids (0.22 g ellagic acid equivalents kg-1  dry weight) and the proportion of NEPP that contained hydrolysable PPs (91.12 g gallic acid equivalents kg-1  dry weight with high AOX. The identified PPs included catechin, quercetin, gallic and hydroxybenzoic acids. CONCLUSION: HPP performed at a room temperature can be used for improving the total content of PP compounds in plantain pulp under specific pressure and time conditions. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Below 76°C and at 100°C, the gelatinization behaviour of starch into pulp pieces and paste was similar, whereas at 85°C a significant mean relative difference was observed in between. For α in the 0-1 range, pieces of plantain pulp exhibited a lower rapidly digestible starch fraction (30%) and a higher resistant starch fraction (33%) than the flour paste, suggesting some structural effects. Both Weibull and exponential models showed a good fit for α over temperature range and starch digestibility fractions over α. Although no explicit relationship was established between the intact pulp structure and grinded flour state of plantain, the evaluation of the degree of starch gelatinization and digestibility of a plantain flour paste, could be used to predict the gelatinization and digestibility behaviour of plantain starch in entire pieces of pulp.",

      "abstract": "Soluble fibres (non-starch polysaccharides, NSP) from edible plants but particularly plantain banana (Musa spp.), have been shown in vitro and ex vivo to prevent various enteric pathogens from adhering to, or translocating across, the human intestinal epithelium, a property that we have termed contrabiotic. Here we report that dietary plantain fibre prevents invasion of the chicken intestinal mucosa by Salmonella. In vivo experiments were performed with chicks fed from hatch on a pellet diet containing soluble plantain NSP (0 to 200 mg/d) and orally infected with S.Typhimurium 4/74 at 8 d of age. Birds were sacrificed 3, 6 and 10 d post-infection. Bacteria were enumerated from liver, spleen and caecal contents. In vitro studies were performed using chicken caecal crypts and porcine intestinal epithelial cells infected with Salmonella enterica serovars following pre-treatment separately with soluble plantain NSP and acidic or neutral polysaccharide fractions of plantain NSP, each compared with saline vehicle. Bacterial adherence and invasion were assessed by gentamicin protection assay. In vivo dietary supplementation with plantain NSP 50 mg/d reduced invasion by S.Typhimurium, as reflected by viable bacterial counts from splenic tissue, by 98.9% (95% CI, 98.1-99.7; P<0.0001). In vitro studies confirmed that plantain NSP (5-10 mg/ml) inhibited adhesion of S.Typhimurium 4/74 to a porcine epithelial cell-line (73% mean inhibition (95% CI, 64-81); P<0.001) and to primary chick caecal crypts (82% mean inhibition (95% CI, 75-90); P<0.001). Adherence inhibition was shown to be mediated via an effect on the epithelial cells and Ussing chamber experiments with ex-vivo human ileal mucosa showed that this effect was associated with increased short circuit current but no change in electrical resistance. The inhibitory activity of plantain NSP lay mainly within the acidic/pectic (homogalacturonan-rich) component. Supplementation of chick feed with plantain NSP was well tolerated and shows promise as a simple approach for reducing invasive salmonellosis.",

The objective of the present study was to assess and describe the grazing behavior of dairy cows as affected by dietary proportions of chicory and plantain fed as monocultures for part of the day. Ninety Holstein-Friesian cows (489±42 kg of body weight; 4.1±0.3 body condition score, and 216±15 d in milk) were randomly assigned to 15 groups (6 cows per group) and grazed according to 7 treatments: control (CTL, 3 groups), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) dominant sward (24-h pasture strip); 3 chicory treatments comprising 20, 40, and 60% of the diet, strip-grazing a monoculture of chicory to a fixed postgrazing residual before strip-grazing a perennial ryegrass dominant sward (2 groups of cows per treatment); and 3 plantain treatments comprising 20, 40, and 60% of the diet, strip-grazing a monoculture of plantain to a fixed postgrazing residual before strip-grazing a perennial ryegrass dominant sward (2 groups of cows per treatment). Four focal animals per group were equipped with 3-dimensional motion sensors, which provided the number of steps taken at each minute of the day. These cows were also fitted with automatic jaw-movement recorders that identified bites, mastication during ingestion, chewing during rumination, and determined grazing, rumination and idling times and bouts. Daily grazing time and bouts were not affected by treatments but rumination time differed and was reduced by up to 90 min when cows were allocated to chicory and plantain as 60% of their diet. Ruminative chewing was reduced in cows grazing chicory and plantain by up to 20% in cows allocated to the 60% treatments. Compared with perennial ryegrass, as the dietary proportion of chicory and plantain increased, cows spent more time idling and less time ruminating, and increased ingestive mastications 5 and 3 times for chicory and plantain, respectively. Cows allocated to chicory and plantain reduced bite rate and bites per grazing step linearly, and increased the number of mastications per bite of pasture dry matter intake while grazing pasture after having grazed chicory and plantain. These results indicate that cows grazing chicory and plantain masticate more during ingestion and reduce rumination time and chewing. They also suggest that chicory presents greater constraints to ingestion than does plantain. Thus, although chicory has been considered to have a greater nutritive value than plantain, its overall feeding value may be no greater than that of plantain.",

We hypothesized that a single administration of Asiatic plantain beverage may exert protective effects against postprandial oxidative stress. This preliminary study was designed to compare the ability of different doses of Asiatic plantain beverage to mitigate the postprandial effects of a high-fat meal on the oxidation of lipids and DNA in overweight hyperlipidemic subjects. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel design (n = 10/group), 40 subjects were administered a single high-fat meal with either a placebo or 1 of 3 Asiatic plantain extract beverages (low, intermediate, or high dose). Blood samples were obtained at fasting and 60, 120, 240, and 360 minutes (total of 5 samples) after intervention. The data showed a tendency for plasma free fatty acid levels to decrease in response to high-dose Asiatic plantain at all time points. Plasma oxidized low-density lipoprotein levels were significantly reduced with high-dose Asiatic plantain at 120 minutes (P = .0251 vs placebo). A comet assay revealed that DNA damage in lymphocytes was significantly decreased by Asiatic plantain at 360 minutes (P = .0225 vs placebo). There were no treatment differences in triglyceride or malondialdehyde levels. The maximum suppression was achieved with a high dose (20 g Asiatic plantain extract/80 mL). These results suggest that by protecting low-density lipoprotein and DNA, an Asiatic plantain beverage may be useful to enhance antioxidant.",

Currently, there is no effective Western medical therapy for functional constipation and it significantly impacts the quality of life of the patients. Integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine therapies were reported to have better therapeutic effects than routine Western medicine therapies. OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy of acupuncture combined with Chinese herbal medicine Plantain and Senna Granule in the treatment of functional constipation. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: A total of 390 patients with confirmed functional constipation enrolled from the Department of Gastroenterology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical College in China from February 2008 to January 2010 were randomly divided into three groups, with 130 cases in each group. Acupuncture group was treated with puncture of point Tianshu (ST25), Shangjuxu (ST37), Zusanli (ST36), Dachangyu (BL25) and Zhigou (SJ6) twice daily for four weeks, while Plantain and Senna Granule group was treated with 5 g of Plantain and Senna Granule once daily, and the combination group was given above-mentioned acupuncture and Plantain and Senna Granule. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The defecation cycle, stool property, constipation symptom, accompanying symptoms, gastrointestinal transit time, including total gastrointestinal transit time, mouth-intestine transit time, colonic transit time, right colonic transit time, left colonic transit time and rectosigmoid colonic transit time, and adverse reactions of the three groups were evaluated before treatment, at the end of treatment and 64 weeks after treatment, respectively. RESULTS: Compared with before treatment, the scores of defecation cycle, stool property, constipation symptoms and accompanying symptoms, and gastrointestinal transit time all decreased significantly at the end of treatment in each group (P<0.01), and the combination group showed better results than the other groups (P<0.05). Compared with the end of treatment, the above-mentioned indexes recurred insignificantly in the combination group and acupuncture group after 64 weeks of follow-up (P>0.05), but all recurred significantly in the Plantain and Senna Granule group (P>0.05). Both short- and long-term total response rates of the combination group showed significant differences compared with those of the other two groups (P<0.05 or P<0.01). No serious adverse reactions occurred in all the three groups. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture plus Plantain and Senna Granule can significantly decrease gastrointestinal transit time and defecation cycle in patients with functional constipation; it can also change stool property and alleviate constipation symptom and accompanying symptoms, with good security and tolerance.",

METHODS: In a prospective, in-hospital controlled trial, two different treatments were administered to a sample of 80 children of both sexes, with ages ranging from 1 to 28 months, who had experienced >or= 14 days of persistent diarrhea. The sample was divided into two groups of isocaloric (100 kcal/kg/d) diets: experimental and control, of 40 patients each. The experimental group was randomly given a-week treatment consisting of a 50 g/L of cooked green plantain-based diet. The control group was fed on a yogurt-based diet. RESULTS: Both groups were not statistically different at admission. Pathogens were isolated from stools in 21.2% and 25% of patients in the experimental and control groups respectively; Aeromonas hydrophilia and Shigela flexneri were the most frequently found bacteria. The experimental group fed on a green plantain diet had a significantly better response in: diminishing stool output and consistency (p < 0.002), stool weight, diarrhea duration (p < 0.001), and increasing daily body weight gain (p < 0.001) than the yogurt-based diet group. The average duration of diarrhea in the plantain-based diet group was 18 hours shorter (p < 0.005) and it also had lower cost (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: Our results support the benefits of green plantain in the dietary management of persistent diarrhea in hospitalized children, in relation to diarrheal duration, weight gain and costs.",

Incubation of 0-200 microg PAEO/ml with HepG2 cells for 24 h resulted in no significant toxicity. Incubation with 0.2 mg PAEO/ml altered the expression of LDL receptor (+83 %; P < 0.05) and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase ( - 37 %; P < 0.05), as assessed using RT-PCR. LDL oxidation was markedly inhibited by PAEO treatment due to the prevalence of linalool compounds in PAEO. Oral administration of PAEO for 3 weeks in C57BL/6 mice significantly reduced plasma total cholesterol and TAG concentrations by 29 and 46 %, respectively. The mRNA (+58 %; P < 0.05), but not protein, levels of the LDL receptor were significantly higher, whereas both mRNA and protein levels of HMG-CoA reductase were significantly lower ( - 46 and - 11 %, respectively; P < 0.05) in the liver of PAEO-fed than of control mice. The mRNA levels of CYP7A1 were marginally reduced in HepG2 cells, but not in mouse liver after PAEO treatment. Thus, PAEO may have hypocholesterolaemic effects by altering the expression of HMG-CoA reductase. Reduced TAG and oxidised LDL may provide additional cardiovascular protective benefits.",

Cylinders (diameter 30 mm, thickness 10 mm) of plantain (Musa AAB 'barraganete') were fried at four thermal treatments (120-180 degrees C and from 24 to 4 min) to obtain products with approximately the same water content (approximately 0.8+/-0.02 kg/kg1) and fat content (approximately 0.15+/-0.06 kg/kg). The thermal study used the cook value and the mean cook value as indicators of the effect of several different treatment temperatures and times on quality. Deep-fat frying had no significant effect on carotenoid contents at any frying conditions, and on potassium content, except at 120 degrees C and 24 min (loss <or= 11%). There was a significant, but not complete, loss (<or=45%) of ascorbic acid. The process with the greatest effect was low temperature and long time (120 degrees C/24 min), as observed for potassium and ascorbic acid. These results are in agreement with other studies that demonstrated short thermal treatments at high temperatures protect food nutritional quality, as shown by the cook value and the mean cook value. In our work, deep-fat frying of plantain preserved most of the micronutrient contents that were evaluated.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The success of oral rehydration therapy in cases of severe diarrheas have led to a need for locally based therapy preparations. A preparation consisting of a precooked plantain flour-based solution and standard rehydration electrolytes was examined for its effectiveness in treating dehydration, as well as its anti-diarrhoeal properties. METHODS: A sample of 101 children, ranging in age from 1 to 48 months, was selected, which had presented diarrhea for less than one week from onset, with mild dehydration and no associated complications. Fifty-four children received the ORS/WHO standard treatment, and 47 received a solution with electrolytes similar to ORS/WHO, containing 50 g of precooked plantain flour instead of glucose (ORS/plantain). RESULTS: Successful rehydration was achieved in 94.4% of the children in the ORS/WHO group and 91.5% in the ORS/plantain group (p = 0.70). Required time for rehydration was 5.8 (SD +/- 3.0) hours in the ORS/WHO group and 6.2 (SD +/- 3.7) hours in the ORS/plantain group (p = 0.31). Stool output during rehydration was 7.5 g/kg body weight/hour (SD +/- 7.6) in the ORS/WHO group, and 7.05 g/kg/hour (SD +/- 9.4) in the ORS/plantain group (p = 0.78). No significant differences were noted in the concentrations of plasma sodium. The observation period was 22.3 hours (SD +/- 5.3) for the ORS/WHO group and 22.7 hours (SD +/- 4.7) for the ORS/plantain group. Stool output during the observation period was 5.7 g/kg/hour (SD +/- 4.7) in the ORS/WHO group and 6.3 g/kg/hour (SD +/- 7.9) in the ORS/plantain group (p = 0.67). The proportion of children requiring intravenous fluids during the first 24 hours was 11.1% in the ORS/WHO group and 8.5% in the ORS/plantain group (RR = 1.31; 95% CI 0.39-4.35). CONCLUSIONS: The plantain flour-based solution proved effective and safe in correcting dehydration; however the antidiarrhoeal properties of ORS/plaintain were not demonstrated.",

      "abstract": "One of the predominant proteins in the pulp of ripe bananas (Musa acuminata L.) and plantains (Musa spp.) has been identified as a lectin. The banana and plantain agglutinins (called BanLec and PlanLec, respectively) were purified in reasonable quantities using a novel isolation procedure, which prevented adsorption of the lectins onto insoluble endogenous polysaccharides. Both BanLec and PlanLec are dimeric proteins composed of two identical subunits of 15 kDa. They readily agglutinate rabbit erythrocytes and exhibit specificity towards mannose. Molecular cloning revealed that BanLec has sequence similarity to previously described lectins of the family of jacalin-related lectins, and according to molecular modelling studies has the same overall fold and three-dimensional structure. The identification of BanLec and PlanLec demonstrates the occurrence of jacalin-related lectins in monocot species, suggesting that these lectins are more widespread among higher plants than is actually believed. The banana and plantain lectins are also the first documented examples of jacalin-related lectins, which are abundantly present in the pulp of mature fruits but are apparently absent from other tissues. However, after treatment of intact plants with methyl jasmonate, BanLec is also clearly induced in leaves. The banana lectin is a powerful murine T-cell mitogen. The relevance of the mitogenicity of the banana lectin is discussed in terms of both the physiological role of the lectin and the impact on food safety.",

Each of the replicate plots per treatment contained two plants of the same genotype. The stinkbugs reduced the survivorship of the specialist caterpillars but not that of the generalists, which reflects the differences in predatoravoidance behaviors of these species. Nonetheless, the stinkbugs influenced the behavior of both caterpillar species. When stinkbugs were present, both specialist and generalist caterpillars were less likely to be found on the plant upon which they were initially placed (=\"initial\" plant), and they were more likely to be off both plants within the plot than larvae in the absence of predators. Consequently in the presence of the stinkbug predators, the proportion of the \"initial\" plants consumed was less than in the absence of the predators. Plant genotype influenced plant size and the proportion of individual plants eaten, but it did not affect larval location on the plots. Neither presence of predators nor plant genotype had an effect on relative growth rate of the caterpillars."
