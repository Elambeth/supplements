      "abstract": "The primary cause of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disorders is hyperlipidemia. Ellagic Acid (EA) is a naturally occurring polyphenol found in fruits and nuts. This medication has garnered attention due to its possible therapeutic benefits, encompassing the treatment of hyperlipidemia. In this study, ellagic acid was incorporated into a nanocarrier system using chitosan, a biodegradable polymer, via an ionotropic gelation technique, aiming to enhance its solubility and bioavailability. The effects of ellagic acid-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (EA-CS-NPs) were evaluated in a hyperlipidemic mouse model induced by poloxamer 407 (PL-407). Administration of a single intraperitoneal dose of 300 mg/kg body weight of PL-407 resulted in the induction of hyperlipidemia. The mice were grouped into five groups: Control, PL-407, EA-free drug, blank CS-NPs, and EA-CS-NPs. Serum analysis included the measurement of liver function biomarkers, lipid profiles, and liver antioxidant capacity. Additionally, a histopathological evaluation of liver tissue was performed. This study showed that PL-407 treatment increased hepatic oxidative stress and serum lipid biomarkers, with significant liver tissue changes in hyperlipidemic mice. EA-CS-NPs exerted the most protective effects, improving hepatic antioxidant capacity, serum lipid profile, and hepatic histological changes, highlighting their potential as a therapeutic approach for hyperlipidemia."

      "abstract": "Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure is significantly linked to lung epithelial cell senescence, and autophagy dysfunction being a key contributor to the aging process. Although the anti-aging properties of ellagic acid (EA) are well-documented, its specific protective effect on PM2.5-induced lung epithelial cell senescence still needs to be studied in depth. To investigate the impacts of PM2.5 on autophagy and senescence in lung epithelial cells, 16HBE and A549 cells were exposed to PM2.5 suspension. Additionally, to explore the potential intervention effect of EA, cells were pretreated with EA before exposure to PM2.5 suspension. Cell morphology, proliferation, senescence-related markers, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and autophagy-related markers were then assessed. Our results showed that the proliferation of 16HBE and A549 cells were inhibited and autophagy dysfunction and senescence were induced under PM2.5 exposure. However, pretreatment with EA can significantly improve the obstruction of autophagy flux caused by PM2.5, thereby effectively alleviating cell senescence. This study reveals the mechanism by which PM2.5 induces senescence in lung epithelial cells and confirms the protective role of ellagic acid in this process."

      "abstract": "Exosome-like nanovesicles derived from plants (PENs) harbor a spectrum of bioactive compounds, including proteins, lipids, nucleic acids (such as miRNAs and mRNAs), offering therapeutic advantages for a variety of diseases. This investigation assesses the utility of pomegranate-derived exosome-like nanovesicles (PNVs) in both preventing and treating complications such as liver damage and increased intestinal permeability found in Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD). Utilizing Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), we successfully isolated PNVs and characterized their structural properties. Upon administration in a live model, these nanovesicles were efficiently distributed to critical organs, including the liver and intestines, demonstrating biocompatibility by avoiding toxic effects. Remarkably, these vesicles were enriched with ellagic acid, known for its strong antioxidant capabilities. In a controlled MASLD mouse study, treatment with PNVs significantly lowered serum endotoxin levels, reinforced intestinal barrier functions, and altered the gut microbiota profile favorably. Furthermore, the application of PNVs reduced oxidative stress and the presence of fibrosis markers in the liver to normal levels. These results indicate that PNVs could be a viable option for addressing MASLD, enhancing intestinal integrity, reducing liver injury, and diminishing fibrosis through the modulation of the gut-liver axis."

      "abstract": "Ellagic acid (EA), a widely distributed natural polyphenolic acid existing in many kinds of plant-based foods, undergoes complex physical and chemical transformations during digestion and biotransformation. Particularly, EA is metabolized by gut microbiota and transformed into urolithins in the colon. These metabolites exhibit enhanced bioavailability and bioactivity. This review explores the intricate interactions between EA and gut microbiota, emphasizing their implications for human health. We discuss the role of gut microbiota in EA metabolism, resulting in distinct metabolic phenotypes associated with varying urolithin production profiles. EA and its gut-derived metabolites, urolithins, have been reported to have the potential to modulate the microbial community composition and function of gut microbiota, promoting beneficial bacteria while reducing harmful ones. Furthermore, EA and urolithins exhibit a spectrum of beneficial biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties, along with enhancements to intestinal barrier function and modulatory effects on metabolic and cardiovascular systems, through molecular mechanisms such as activating Nrf2 and inhibiting NF-κB pathways. The review highlights and compares the potential of EA and its gut microbial metabolites in the prevention and treatment of various diseases. However, further studies are required to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the interactions between EA and gut microbiota and their health benefits. Continued investigation into EA and its metabolites is essential for advancing our understanding of their role in promoting human health and developing novel therapeutic applications."

      "abstract": "Ellagic acid (EA) exhibits protective effects on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the ability to produce urolithins and the health benefits associated with EA consumption differ considerably among individuals. Therefore, the different effects of EA on high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFFD)-induced NAFLD, considering variability in urolithin-producing ability, were explored. Our results showed that EA could effectively reduce body weight, lipid accumulation and insulin resistance, and improve oxidative stress and inflammation in NAFLD mice. The metabolomics analysis indicated that liver metabolism disorder induced by HFFD was obviously improved by EA mainly through the regulation of unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and amino acid metabolism. In particular, the improvement effect of EA on NAFLD in mice with high urolithin A production was better than that in their low counterparts. Moreover, EA treatment reshaped the gut microbiota imbalance caused by HFFD. Specifically, compared to the model group, the lower abundances of Faecalibaculum (by 95.11%), Ruminococcus_torques_group (by 208.14%), Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 (by 449.37%), and Ileibacterium (by 172.64%), while higher abundances of Verrucomicrobia and Akkermansia (by 425.0%) were observed in the high-UroA-producing group (p < 0.05). This study provided new insights into EA's anti-NAFLD effectiveness and suggested that the response capacity of the gut microbiota to EA greatly determined the performance of EA in alleviating the development of NAFLD.",

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Hind limb ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a serious clinical condition that requires urgent treatment and develops as a result of a sudden decrease in blood flow in the extremity. Antioxidant combinations are frequently used in diseases today. This study aimed to investigate and compare the effectiveness of ellagic acid (EA) and berberine (BER), which are important antioxidants, and the combination on hind limb I/R injury to evaluate their therapeutic power. Materials and Methods: Thirty-five male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups: sham, I/R, EA+I/R, BER+I/R, and EA/BER+I/R. In the I/R procedure, the infrarenal abdominal aorta was clamped and reperfused for 2 h. EA (100 mg/kg, ip) and BER (200 mg/kg, ip) were administered in the 75th minute of ischemia. Oxidative stress markers (MDA, GSH, SOD, and CAT) and TNF-α were measured. Apoptosis (Bax, Bcl-2, and Cleaved caspase-3) and pyroptosis (Nrf2, NLRP3, and Gasdermin D) pathways were evaluated via Western blot. Muscle tissue was examined histopathologically by hematoxylin eosin staining. One-way ANOVA and post hoc LSD tests were applied for statistical analyses (p < 0.05). Results: Bax levels increased in the ischemia group and decreased with EA and BER (p < 0.05). Bcl-2 levels decreased in the ischemia group but increased with EA and BER (p < 0.05). The highest level of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was in the I/R group (p < 0.05). Cleaved caspase 3 was higher in the other groups compared to the sham group (p < 0.05). While Nrf2 decreased in the I/R group, NLRP3 and Gasdermin D increased; EA and BER normalized these levels (p < 0.05). In the histopathological analysis, a combination of EA and BER reduced damage (p < 0.05). TNF-α levels were similar between groups (p > 0.05). MDA levels were reduced by EA and BER, but GSH, SOD, and CAT levels were increased (p < 0.05). Conclusions: It was concluded that TNF-α levels depend on the degree and duration of inflammation and that no difference was found in relation to duration in this study. As a result, EA, BER, and their combination could be potential treatment agents on hind limb I/R injury with these positive effects.",

      "abstract": "Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a rare and serious chronic interstitial lung disease that may endanger the lives of patients. The median survival time of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is short, and the mortality rate is higher than that of many types of cancer. At present, pirfenidone (PFD) and nintedanib (NDNB) have been approved by FDA for IPF, but they can only delay the process of pulmonary fibrosis and cannot cure the disease. Therefore, it is urgent to develop other drugs with the effect of improving pulmonary fibrosis. Ellagic acid (EA) can inhibit the Wnt-signaling pathway and has an effect in treating pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin (BLM) in mice. However, its solubility is poor, resulting in its low bioavailability and limited therapeutic benefits, so its clinical application has been limited. Herein, based on the characteristics of nano-drug lung delivery system, chitosan (CS) was selected as the carrier, and ellagic acid-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (EA-CS-NPs) were prepared by ionic gelation method. The EE% and DL% of prepared EA-CS-NPs was 73.73 ± 4.52% and 6.23 ± 1.09%, the particle size was 119.6 ± 5.51 nm (PDI = 0.234 ± 0.017), the zeta potential was 29.833 ± 0.503 mV. The morphology of the nanoparticles was observed by TEM microscope, which was round, uniform dispersion, indicating that the preparation process is stable and feasible. The toxicity experiment showed that EA-CS-NPs maintained 80% cell viability, significantly higher than that of the NDNB group, indicating lower toxicity and better inhibitory effects on TGF-β1-stimulated MLg and NIH-3T3 cells. Wound healing assay results showed that the inhibitory effect of EA-CS-NPs on cell migration was more pronounced than that of EA in the same amount of EA-containing drugs. Drug uptake experiments revealed that EA-CS-NPs significantly enhanced drug uptake in MLg and NIH-3T3 cells. In vivo, Cy7-CS-NPs exhibited higher fluorescence intensity in rat lungs compared to Cy7 solution, indicating better lung retention. The in vivo efficacy test showed that compared with the EA group, EA-CS-NPs could better reduce the area of pulmonary fibrosis and collagen deposition, improve lung function, and have a longer retention time in the lung. In summary, our results revealed that EA-CS-NPs may be a good choice for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.",

Goat semen was frozen using Tris-citric acid-glucose (TCG) extender containing 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 μM of EA. Egg yolk represented 20 % (v/v) and glycerol represented 5 % (v/v) of the extender's final concentration. Goat sperm post-thaw motility, acrosome integrity, plasma membrane integrity, mitochondrial activity, ATP content, NADH/NAD+ levels, and NADH-CoQ activity were evaluated. Moreover, to elucidate how EA enhanced the goat sperm characteristics, the post-thaw sperm mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, malondialdehyde (MDA) level, oxidative DNA damage, apoptosis, levels of NADH dehydrogenase 1 (MT-ND1) and NADH dehydrogenase 6 (MT-ND6) proteins, and the 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) level were also measured after thawing. The results demonstrated that motility, plasma membrane integrity, and acrosome integrity rates were enhanced in the group treated with 5 μM of EA compared to the other concentrations (0 μM, 1.25 μM, 2.5 μM, 5, and 10 μM). Moreover, mitochondrial activity and ATP content were notably superior in the 5 μM EA group compared to all other treatment groups, along with a considerable decrease in ROS and MDA levels. The 4-HNE level and oxidative DNA damage in sperm were also reduced by EA supplementation. Additionally, it was found that EA (5 μM) significantly (p < 0.05) decreased sperm apoptosis levels. Furthermore, the addition of 5 μM EA maintained the post-thaw sperm MT-ND1 and MT-ND6 levels and reduced the negative impact of ROS on MT-ND1 and MT-ND6, thereby sustaining mitochondrial function for ATP generation. These results suggest that ellagic acid supplementation could maintain goat post-thaw sperm quality by reducing ROS damage and maintaining mitochondrial function for ATP generation. Antioxidant treatments, such as ellagic acid are a useful tool for maintaining frozen-thawed sperm quality."

      "abstract": "The pH-shifting and thermal-assisted pH-shifting process was applied to fabricate the silkworm pupa protein (SPP) and ellagic acid (EA) conjugates (SPP-EATP). The result revealed that more binding sites of SPP were exposed after the thermal-assisted pH-shifting treatment, which increased the conjugation between SPP and EA. This conjugation enhanced hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions between SPP and EA, increasing the random coil content while reducing α-helix structure, thereby improving the flexibility of SPP-EATP. The SPP-EATP conjugate has outstanding emulsification stability and antioxidant capacity. For example, SPP-EATP can effectively stabilize and protect the high internal phase emulsion (containing 74% fish oil fraction) from oxidation. Furthermore, the emulsion prepared by SPP-EATP exhibited an excellent shelf-life due to the formation of a more compact boundary layer, which effectively prevents droplet aggregation and isolation of fish oil from pro-oxidants in the continuous phase. These findings provide a novel approach to the valorizing of SPP. Furthermore, the conjugate between SPP and EA possesses the potential application as an effective emulsion stabilizer in the food industry. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The oxidation of fish oil during transportation and storage attenuates its physiological activity, thereby severely limiting its potential utilization in functionalized food. Through the thermal-assisted pH-shifting process, the prepared SPP-EA conjugate exhibits outstanding emulsifying and antioxidant performance. For instance, the shelf-life of the high fish oil fraction emulsion is substantially extended as the conjugate is used as the stabilizer. Hence, the conjugate can be widely utilized as the antioxidant emulsifier to protect active substances from oxidizing in the functional food industry.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) hinders the clearance of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by promoting the degradation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), leading to the accumulation of LDL-C and thus becoming an important cause of atherosclerosis. Ellagic acid, a naturally occurring polyphenol widely present in fruits, vegetables, and nuts, has attracted significant attention due to its potential role in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms by which ellagic acid alleviates atherosclerosis by inhibiting PCSK9 are not fully understood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study further validated the mechanism of action of ellagic acid through in vitro HepG2 cell experiments and a high-fat diet-induced ApoE-/- mouse model. RESULTS: The results showed that ellagic acid significantly reduced the expression and secretion of PCSK9 while upregulating LDLR protein levels; its mechanism is related to the inhibition of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF1α) expression and the promotion of forkhead box O3 (FoxO3) expression increase. Additionally, ellagic acid reduced aortic plaque deposition in mice induced by a high-fat diet; consistent with the in vitro experimental results, ellagic acid lowered the expression and secretion of PCSK9 and elevated LDLR protein levels by inhibiting HNF1α and increased FoxO3 expression. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this study demonstrates that ellagic acid inhibits PCSK9 by regulating HNF1α and FoxO3, thereby increasing LDLR levels and alleviating atherosclerosis. This finding not only consolidates the scientific basis of plant-based diets for preventing cardiovascular diseases but also provides an important direction for developing functional foods and nutritional intervention strategies based on natural polyphenols.",

Despite intensive efforts to overcome ovarian cancer, there remain limited treatment options for this disease. Ellagic acid (EA), a well-known phytochemical with anti-inflammatory properties, is suggested as a therapeutical strategy as it can inhibit the growth of certain cancer cells. However, its effect on human ovarian carcinoma cells has not yet been fully elucidated.

Human ovarian carcinoma cell lines, A2780 and OVCAR3, were treated with EA (0, 10, 20, 50, and 100 μM) and assessed for viability, cell cycle (cyclin D1 and cyclin E), pyroptosis (gasdermin D [GSDMD] and gasdermin E [GSDME]), autophagy (microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 [MAP1LC3] and autophagy protein 5 [ATG5]), and inflammation (interleukin [IL]-1b and IL-6) via 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT), real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The findings showed that EA could significantly inhibit cell viability, decrease cyclin D1 and E levels, downregulate GSDMD and GSDME, and suppress the levels of inflammatory markers, including IL-1b and IL-6. However, the protein levels of autophagic markers including LC3 and ATG5 remained mostly unchanged. The findings suggest that EA could suppress ovarian cancer cell viability and proliferation by arresting both cell lines at the G1 phase of the cell cycle through modification of cell death mediated by inflammatory-caused pyroptosis.",

In this study, ellagic acid as a solid hydrophobic substance and Litsea Cubeba essential oil as an oily hydrophobic component were successfully loaded using heat- and ultrasonic- treated soy protein as a carrier. Ellagic acid was initially loaded into treated soy protein via pH-shifting. A stable Pickering emulsion was then prepared with Litsea Cubeba essential oil and solid particles adsorbed at the oil-water interface. This emulsion exhibited high centrifugal, thermal, and pH stability. When incorporated into a sodium alginate coating, the Pickering emulsion enhanced the antioxidant properties and shelf life of grapes. The results suggest heat and ultrasonic treatment are a promising approach for protein based hydrophobic compounds co-delivery system, improving dispersion and antioxidant capacity, thereby advancing co-delivery systems in food science.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male BALB/C mice were divided into 5 groups; vehicle (0.1 ml/day), sertraline (5mg/kg), EA (1 mg/kg), EA+BKM120 (PI3K inhibitor), EA+MK2206 (AKT inhibitor). EA, sertraline and vehicle were injected intraperitoneally for 14 days. Locomotor activity was determined by open field test. The tail suspension test was used to detect the antidepressant-like effect. After behavioral tests, hippocampal tissue was obtained and Western blot analyzes were performed for BDNF and pAKT1. RESULTS: Sertraline and EA provided a reduction in immobility time in the tail suspension test when compared with the control group. BKM120 and MK2206 administration reversed this effect of EA. No statistical difference was found between groups in terms of locomotor activity. EA treatment caused an increase in hippocampal BDNF and pAKT1 levels in mice. While inhibitory agent administrations did not affect the increase of BDNF induced by EA, MK2206 administration reversed the increase in pAKT1 observed with EA. CONCLUSION: It has shown that EA has an antidepressant-like effect in mice without changing locomotor activity, and this effect may be mediated by the BDNF-PI3K-AKT signaling pathway."

In this study, the effects of iron oxide nanoparticles functionalized with glucose and conjugated with ellagic acid (EA) on gastric cancer cells were evaluated. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, dynamic light scattering, and zeta potential analyses were used for physical and chemical characterizations. The percentage of cell viability was determined by (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay, and cell apoptosis level and cell cycle analysis were assayed using flow cytometry. Also, the expression level of the caspase-8 gene was evaluated using a real-time polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that the IC50 of Fe3O4@Glu-EA nanoparticles for the human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line and human dermal fibroblasts cell line was 109 and 211µg/mL. Based on the flow cytometry results, the synthesized nanoparticles increased cell cycle inhibition at the G0/G1 phase and caused a significant increase in early and late apoptosis in cancer cells. Alterations in nuclear morphology such as chromatin condensation and fragmentation in favor of apoptosis were evident in cancer cells treated with the nanoparticles, and the expression of the caspase-8 gene in these cells was elevated by 4.91 folds. This study showed that Fe3O4@Glu-EA nanoparticles have considerable toxicity for gastric cancer cells and as an efficient platform for delivery of EA to gastric cancer cells, can provide promising outcomes in chemotherapy of gastric cancer."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The liver is vital for metabolism, detoxification, storage, and secretion. Cholestasis, in which bile flow is hindered, can cause serious harm to the liver. This study examines the potential of ellagic acid to prevent cholestasis in male rats that has been caused by alpha-naphthyl isothiocyanate (ANIT). METHOD: Male rats were divided into four groups for an 8-day study. The control group received 5 % dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) orally for eight days and maize oil (1 mL/kg, orally) 48 h before sacrifice. The ANIT Group received 5 % DMSO orally for 8 days, the ANIT (100 mg/kg, orally) administered on the 6th day, 48 h before sacrifice. The low-Dose Ellagic Acid + ANIT Group was given ellagic acid (5 mg/kg, orally) for eight days, with ANIT (100 mg/kg, orally) on the 6th day, 48 h prior to sacrifice. The high-Dose Ellagic Acid + ANIT Group received ellagic acid (10 mg/kg, orally) for eight days, the ANIT (100 mg/kg, orally) on the 6th day, 48 h before sacrifice. Different biochemical and histopathological analyses were conducted to assess the protective effects of ellagic acid on ANIT-induced liver injury. RESULTS: ANIT significantly elevated serum of liver enzymes. It caused severe bile duct inflammation and reduced bile salt export pump (BSEP) and Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) expression, indicating liver injury. Ellagic acid treatment mitigated these changes, improving biochemical parameters and reducing liver damage. ANIT-induced cholestasis results in bile acid accumulation due to decreased BSEP and NTCP expression linked to impaired farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling. Ellagic acid restored BSEP and NTCP levels via FXR activation, reducing bile acids and inflammatory markers IL-1β and TNF-α. Ellagic acid also enhanced SIRT1 activity, further improving FXR function and bile acid homeostasis. CONCLUSIONS: Ellagic acid exhibits protective effects against cholestasis by enhancing the FXR signaling and ntcp and bsep expression with mitigating liver damage and inflammation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It seems that oxidative stress is involved in the occurrence and progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Considering the antioxidant features of Ellagic acid (EA), this study was designed to assess the effect of EA on some biochemical factors in patients with NAFLD. METHODS: In this clinical trial, 44 patients were selected based on including criteria and randomly received 180 mg of EA per day (n = 22) or placebo (n = 22) for 8 weeks. At the beginning and end of the study, glycemic indices, lipid profiles, liver enzymes, oxidative stress markers, and inflammatory factors were measured. RESULTS: At the end of the study, the mean of insulin, insulin resistance (IR), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), malondialdehyde (MDA), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly decreased in the intervention group (P < 0.05). Also, a significant increase in the mean of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was observed in the EA group (P < 0.05). However, changes in high-density lipoprotein (HDL), total cholesterol (TC), and fasting blood sugar (FBS) were not significant in any of the groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results, the present study provided evidence that EA can be used as a supplemental therapy alongside current treatment plans to reduce the complications of NAFLD due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was prospectively registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials on the 23th of January 2022 (ID: IRCT20141025019669N21).",

However, the role of EA in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CIRI) remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the neuroprotective effects of EA in CIRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty male Wistar rats (260-300 g) were randomly divided into four groups with 10 rats per group: 1) Sham+Veh: Rats underwent I/R surgery, except that they were not inserted with thread plugs, and received solute treatment at the same time. 2) MCAO/R+Veh. 3) MCAO/R+EA: Rats were administered 200 mg/kg EA before undergoing MCAO. 4) MCAO/R+Nim: Rats were administered Nim before undergoing MCAO. RESULTS: Cerebral MCAO/R damaged brain tissue, elevated neurological deficit score (P<0.01), cerebral infarction volume (P<0.01), inflammatory cell infiltration (P<0.01), NLRP6, ASC, caspase-1 and GSDMD mRNA level (P<0.01 and P<0.001), NLRP6, caspase-1, GSDMD-N and IL-1β protein level (P<0.01 and P<0.001), and inflammatory cytokines in brain tissue (P<0.01).

Although the pathoetiology of NAFLD is not fully elucidated, recent evidence suggests the involvement of stress, inflammation, and programmed death in the onset and progression of the disease. This investigation aimed to evaluate the effects of ellagic acid (EA), a known herbal antioxidant, on a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced animal model of NAFLD by evaluating the status of lipid profile, necroptosis (RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL), autophagy (LC3, ATG5, and BECN1), inflammation (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-4, and IL-10), and stress (SOD, CAT, GR, GPx, and MDA). In this regard, rats were randomly divided into 6 groups as follows: normal diet controls, HFD (supplemented with high caloric diet model), EA low dose (HFD and 10 mg/kg/day EA), EA middle dose (HFD and 25 mg/kg/day EA), EA high dose (HFD and 50 mg/kg/day EA), and Rosiglitazone (HFD and 10 mg/kg/day Rosi). After the treatment, the levels of markers related to necroptosis and autophagy in the liver tissue as well as the lipid profiles, inflammation, and oxidative stress status were analyzed. It was shown that the dose of EA was able to improve the weight gain and lipid profile when compared to NAFLD animals (p-value < 0.001). Moreover, EA increased the level of LC3 and ATG5 while decreasing BECN 1, RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL compared to the HFD-induced NAFLD rats (p-value < 0.05). TNF-α and IL-6 were decreased after EA administration, whereas IL-4 and IL-10 levels were increased (p-value < 0.001). Furthermore, the increase in the activity of SOD, CAT, GR, and GPx along with the decrease in MDA levels indicated the suppression of oxidative stress by EA treatment compared to the NAFLD rats (p-value < 0.0001). The current findings may suggest that EA improves NAFLD via modulation of necroptosis, autophagy, inflammation, and stress."

      "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) can cause severe oxidative stress in the colon, which can lead to tissue damage and an imbalance in the normal gut microbiota. Ellagic acid (EA) is one of the main types of plant polyphenols with improved pharmacological effects such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial properties. However, currently, the studies on the impact of EA on the gut microbiota and its potential to alleviate UC in mice through the ROS/NLRP3 pathway are limited. In this study, dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) was used to construct a UC mouse model, which was then treated with EA as an intervention for UC. The results revealed that EA alleviated the trend of liver, spleen, and weight changes in UC mice and improved colon oxidative stress, inflammation, and pathological damage. Mechanistically, DSS-induced UC indicated a significant increase in ROS/NLRP3 pathway-related factors, whereas EA intervention activated the Nrf2 pathway to reduce these factors. Furthermore, the DSS group had a reduced abundance of Firmicutes (59.02%) and an increased abundance of Bacteroides and Proteobacterium by 1.8 times and 10.16%; however, EA intervention reversed these changes, thus alleviating UC. The findings of this study revealed that EA could significantly enhance the composition of gut microbiota in UC and reduce the inflammatory response, colonic damage as well as oxidative stress caused by DSS by regulating the ROS/NLRP3 pathway. These results provide novel perspectives on the prevention and treatment strategies of UC and highlight the therapeutic benefits of EA in managing colitis.",

Ellagic acid (EA) has demonstrated antifungal activity; however, its effects are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the in vitro anti-Candida activity of EA and its ability to potentiate the effects of fluconazole (FLZ) on C. albicans.Methods: The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of EA was determined by broth microdilution and its interaction with FLZ was assessed using a checkerboard assay. Additionally, we examined the effects of EA on yeast-to-hypha transition, inhibition of biofilm formation, time-kill kinetics, hemolytic activity, and cytotoxicity in HeLa ATCC® CCL-2™ cells. Results: EA exhibited MIC values ranging from 250 to 2000 µg/mL and showed synergistic and additive interactions with FLZ, resulting in a marked reduction in the MIC values of FLZ (up to 32-fold) and EA (up to 16-fold). In the time-kill assay, the most effective combinations were 4× EA MIC, 2× EA MIC, and FIC EA + FLZ, which showed fungicidal activity. Furthermore, EA did not show hemolytic activity and demonstrated low and dose-dependent cytotoxicity in HeLa cells, with no cytotoxic effects observed in combination with FLZ. EA and the synergistic combination of EA and FLZ interfered with both the yeast-to-hypha transition process in C. albicans cells and biofilm formation. In addition to its antifungal efficacy, EA demonstrated a favorable safety profile at the concentrations used. Conclusions: This study presents promising results regarding the potential use of EA in combination with FLZ for the treatment of C. albicans infections."

Ellagic acid and carnosic acid in combination were applied topically and as oral gavage to the full-thickness excisional wounds of all animals except for those in the control group. We investigated oxidative events with malondialdehyde, glutathione, nitric oxide, protein carbonyl, collagen spectrophotometrically, and matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 and advanced oxidation protein product levels using ELISA. RESULTS: The combination of ellagic acid and carnosic acid decreased malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, protein carbonyl, advanced oxidation protein product, and metalloproteinase 9 levels and increased the rate of wound contraction and collagen levels in the diabetic wound healing model. CONCLUSION: The combined use of ellagic acid and carnosic acid showed a synergistic effect, enhanced wound healing, and decreased oxidative stress. This combination may provide effective therapy for chronic nonhealing wounds that occur as a complication of diabetes."

In this work, we developed an ellagic acid (EA) - endogenous protein (eP) nanocomposite (eP-EA) to target tumors by EPR (enhanced permeability and retention), kill bacteria within tumors to regulate anti-tumor immune responses. The potential mechanism of eP-EA treatment is associated with the reduced abundance and diversity of microorganisms within the tumor, culminating with an altered metabolism within the Tumor microenvironment (TME). Among them, the metabolite histamine that contributes to tumor progression, is significantly reduced in the TME after eP-EA treatment. We show that one possible mechanism by which these microbes promote tumor growth is through the production of histamine. This work suggests that the ellagic acid (EA)-protein nano complex can enhance cancer immunotherapy by targeting the intratumoral bacteria and reduce their production of histamine, delineating the potential relationship between intratumor bacteria and their impact on tumors. Our work suggests that the EA-protein nano complex can enhance cancer immunotherapy by targeting the intratumoral bacteria, suggesting the role of bacterial metabolites in contributing to tumor progression.",

      "abstract": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are responsible for chemoresistance and tumor relapse in many solid malignancies, including lung and ovarian cancer. Ellagic acid (EA), a natural polyphenol, exhibits anticancer effects on various human malignancies. However, its impact and mechanism of action on cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) are only partially understood. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential and underlying molecular mechanism of EA isolated from tropical mango against CSLCs. Herein, we observed that EA treatment reduces the stem-like phenotypes in cancer cells, thereby lowering the cell survival and self-renewal potential of ovarian and lung CSLCs. Additionally, EA treatment limits the populations of lung and ovarian CSLCs characterized by CD133+ and CD44+CD117+, respectively. A mechanistic investigation showed that EA treatment induces ROS generation by altering mitochondrial dynamics, causing changes in the levels of Drp1 and Mfn2, which lead to an increased level of accumulation of DNA damage and eventually trigger apoptosis in CSLCs. Moreover, pretreatment with EA sensitizes CSLCs to cisplatin treatment by enhancing DNA damage accumulation and impairing the DNA repair ability of the CSLCs. Furthermore, EA pretreatment significantly reduces cisplatin-induced mutation frequency and improves drug retention in CSLCs, potentially suppressing the development of acquired drug resistance. Taken together, our results demonstrate an unreported finding that EA inhibits CSLCs by targeting mitochondrial function and triggering apoptosis. Thus, EA can be used either alone or in combination with other chemotherepeutic drugs for the management of cancer."

Ellagic acid (EA), a natural polyphenol, presents anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. However, EA's role and molecular mechanism in osteoblasts have not yet been elucidated. In this study, exogenous supplementation with EA restored the osteoporotic bone defects in ovariectomized (OVX)-induced osteoporotic mice. Also, EA inhibited the H2O2-induced apoptosis of primary osteoblasts, prevented the production of reactive oxygen species, and restored the bone-forming potential of osteoblasts. Furthermore, EA was revealed to activate Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) and its downstream Nrf2/Heme Oxygenase 1 (HO-1) signaling pathway, and EX527 (a SIRT1 inhibitor) partially counteracted the effect of EA on bone loss. The findings suggest that EA protects against osteoporotic bone loss by activating SIRT1 and its downstream Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, providing novel insights into the potential of EA as a treatment agent for osteoporosis-related bone metabolism diseases.",

Some phytochemicals due to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects can modulate the bone signaling pathways and improve bone healing and thus can be a good candidate for osteoregeneration. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of Juglans regia L. extract compared to ellagic acid on bone neoformation in rats. The animals with a 5 mm calvaria defect were divided into four groups (n = 10): group 1 was treated with ellagic acid 1% (EA), group 2 was treated with Juglans regia L. extract 10% (JR), group 3 was treated with a biphasic mix of hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate (Ceraform), and group 4 was treated with vehicle inert gel with carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). After 3 weeks of treatment, blood samples were collected for oxidative stress and inflammation assessment. Additionally, the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Β ligand (RANKL) and hydroxyproline levels were quantified in blood. The skull samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy in order to detect the modifications in the four groups. The results suggested that JR extract had relevant anti-oxidant effect and bone protective activity and generated the accumulation of Ca and P, demonstrating the potential therapeutic abilities in bone regeneration.",

      "abstract": "Trichinellosis is a widespread food-borne zoonosis, causing mild to severe illness in humans with potential fatality. Its treatment remains challenging due to the side effects and limited efficacy of specific drugs. Therefore, the current study was conducted to assess the therapeutic effects of ellagic acid (EA) alone and combined with albendazole against trichinellosis and its biochemical and pathological alterations in mice. Mice were divided into two main groups: G1 and G2 for the intestinal and muscular phases, respectively. Then each group was subdivided into five subgroups: (a) non-infected control, (b) infected control non-treated, (c) infected and treated with EA, (d) infected and treated with albendazole, and (e) infected and treated with a combination of both. Parasitological, biochemical, and histopathological studies were used to evaluate the therapeutic outcomes. Treatment with EA resulted in a significant reduction of the mean counts of intestinal adult worms and muscular larvae compared to the infected control. EA improved oxidative stress as it reduced nitric oxide and increased catalase activities in intestinal and muscular tissues. Additionally, it alleviated the inflammatory response, as evidenced by downregulating IL-6 and increasing IL-10 expressions in tissues. Furthermore, it improved liver functions and ameliorated the pathological alterations induced by trichinellosis. The best results were detected in combination treatments that indicated synergistic effects between EA and albendazole. In conclusion, EA can be used as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant with a promising anti-parasitic impact against trichinellosis.",

      "abstract": "Exposure to cadmium sulfate (CdSO4) can lead to neurotoxicity. Nevertheless, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear, and effective treatment strategies are scarce. This study explored the protective effects of ellagic acid (EA), a natural polyphenolic compound, against CdSO4 exposure-induced neurotoxicity in HT22 cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our findings demonstrated that exposure of HT22 cells to CdSO4 resulted in apoptosis, which was effectively reversed by EA in a dose-dependent manner. EA supplementation also decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial ROS production, reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and restored the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). Additionally, EA supplementation at 5-20 μM significantly counteracted Cd-induced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the decrease of ATP and reduced the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and cleaved-caspase-3 protein expression. Furthermore, EA supplementation resulted in the upregulation of Nrf2 and HO-1 protein and mRNAs while simultaneously downregulating the phosphorylation of JNK and p38 proteins. The pharmacological inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) partially attenuated the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway induced by CdSO4 and exacerbated its cytotoxic effects. In conclusion, our findings suggest that ethyl acetate (EA) supplementation offers protective effects against CdSO4-induced apoptosis in HT22 cells by inhibiting oxidative stress and activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Furthermore, the activation of the JNK pathway appears to play a protective role in CdSO4-induced apoptosis in HT22 cells."

Recognized for its potential in impeding disease progression, EA's effectiveness and mechanism in treating 5xFAD remain elusive. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aims to investigate EA's potential roles and underlying mechanisms in mitigating symptoms associated with 5xFAD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 5 × FAD mice underwent a 12-week EA treatment regimen. The efficacy of EA against 5 × FAD was assessed through in vivo experiments, including Morris water maze and contextual fear conditioning tests for learning and memory abilities. Immunofluorescence (IF) and thioflavin staining examined changes in Aβ/neurons in brain tissue. RT‒qPCR evaluated inflammatory cytokine expression, while Bcl2/Bax protein levels were analyzed via Western blot (WB). RESULTS: EA demonstrates promise in alleviating symptoms associated with 5xFAD. It significantly reduced the mice's escape latency in the Morris water maze, increased the frequency of crossings in the target quadrant, and prolonged freezing time in the contextual fear memory test. EA also improved neuronal pathology in the hippocampus and cortex, decreased neuronal loss, and reduced Aβ levels. Moreover, EA significantly increased MDA and SOD levels, effectively modulated the Bcl2/Bax ratio, and decreased the production of proinflammatory factors in brain tissue of 5xFAD model mice. IN CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the potential therapeutic efficacy of EA in addressing 5xFAD-related nervous system disorders by targeting Aβ levels, oxidative stress, and inflammation.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES:  Pulp capping is a pivotal treatment in dentistry aimed at preserving pulp vitality. While calcium hydroxide has long been considered the gold standard in pulp capping materials, its long-term use can induce chronic inflammation, ultimately leading to pulp necrosis and affecting human health. In this context, ellagic acid, a natural compound with potent anti-inflammatory properties, emerged as a promising adjunct to mitigate inflammation associated with calcium hydroxide application, thereby sustaining pulp vitality. This study aimed to investigate the inflammatory response by alterations in neutrophil, macrophage, lymphocyte, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) expression following the treatment with a combination of calcium hydroxide and ellagic acid. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Dental pulp perforation was made on 27 male Wistar rats on the upper first molar and then pulp capped with calcium hydroxide and ellagic acid. The pulp of the control positive group was capped with calcium hydroxide, and the control group was not capped. The teeth were then extracted after 1, 3, and 7 days posttreatment. The differences in the number of neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and TNF-α expression were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) test. RESULTS: The treatment combination of calcium hydroxide and ellagic acid showed the lowest neutrophil number and TNF-α expression compared with the other groups (p < 0.05), while the macrophage and lymphocyte numbers were the highest compared with the other groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION:  The combination of calcium hydroxide and ellagic acid as a pulp capping material exhibited a dual effect on the inflammatory response in dental pulp. These findings suggest that calcium hydroxide and ellagic acid modulate the inflammatory response in a complex manner, promoting a more controlled and potentially beneficial healing process."

Excessive alcohol consumption disrupts the integrity of the intestinal barrier and perturbs the balance of gut microbiota, thereby facilitating the progression of ALD. Ellagic acid (EA) has been extensively reported to be an effective intervention for alleviating liver symptoms. However, the target molecules of EA in improving ALD and its underlying mechanism remain elusive. First, our study indicates that EA ameliorated ALD through the hepatic circadian rhythm signaling by up-regulating neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2). Furthermore, analysis of the intestinal microbiome showed that EA significantly enhanced the abundance of beneficial bacteria, which was positively correlated with NPAS2 expression and negatively correlated with liver injury. Finally, antibiotic treatment and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments established a causal relationship between the reshaped microbiota and NPAS2 in the amelioration of ALD. In summary, our study demonstrates novel evidence that EA attenuated ALD by modulating the hepatic circadian rhythm signaling pathway via the gut microbiota-NPAS2 axis, providing valuable insights for EA and microbiome-targeted interventions against ALD.",

Hence, the present study was arranged to investigate the effect of dietary supplementary with EA on the intestinal barrier function and flora structure of broiler chickens challenged with Escherichia coli K88 (E. coli K88). A total of 216 healthy 1-day-old, Ross 308 broilers with uniform weight were randomly assigned into three treatment groups, six replicates in each group and twelve birds in each replicate. Broilers in the control (CTR) group and E. coli K88 infected group (ETEC) were fed with the basic diet, and 200 mg/kg EA was supplemented into the diet of the E. coli K88 infected group treated with EA (EAETEC). The animal trial had lasted for 42 days, and the outcomes showed that the ADG and ADFI during the animal trial, the jejunal villi height (VH) and the ratio of VH to crypt depth (CD) tended to be decreased with E. coli K88 treated (P< 0.05). Additionally, the level of serum diamine oxidase (DAO) and intestinal malondialdehyde (MDA) were elevated, the activity of intestinal total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), the mRNA levels in jejunal claudin-1 and occludin were down-regulated with E. coli K88 treated as well as the transcription levels of ileal Mucin-2, aquaporin-3 (AQP-3) and Na+/H+ exchanger proteins-3 (NHE-3) (P< 0.05). In addition, E. coli K88 down-regulated the α-diversity index of cecal flora, the ratio of Bacteroidota to Firmicutes and the relative abundance of Barnesiella were up-regulated and it of Alistipes was descended with E. coli K88 treated (P< 0.05). Beyond that, the content of propionic acid in the cecal chyme was decreased and the amino acid metabolic pathways were inhibited with E. coli K88 challenged (P< 0.05). Additionally, there was a significant positive correlation between the relative abundance of Alistipes and the levels of butyric acid in the caecal chyme and the activity of GSH-Px in the intestine (P< 0.05). Interestingly, dietary supplementary with EA could reshape the intestinal flora structure and alleviate the above negative effects of E. coli K88 on broiler chickens. In conclusion, dietary supplementary with ellagic acid improved the intestinal barrier function and flora structure of broiler chickens challenged with E. coli K88.",

      "abstract": "Chronic alcohol consumption disrupts the balance of the gut microbiome, resulting in alcohol-induced cognitive and social dysfunction (AICSD), and serves as a primary etiological factor for early-onset dementia. Ellagic acid (EA) is a polyphenolic compound belonging to the ellagitannin family, showing potential as a dietary intervention for alleviating cognitive impairments. Nonetheless, the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of EA on AICSD remain unclear. In our study, we employed a multi-omics approach to elucidate the microbiome-mediated mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of EA on AICSD. Firstly, our findings demonstrate that EA significantly ameliorated cognitive and social behavioral deficits as well as neuroinflammation induced by alcohol. Moreover, RNA-seq analysis of hippocampi indicates that EA regulated the KEGG pathway of cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction signaling by downregulating the CCL21-CCR7 axis. Furthermore, we observed that EA effectively restored the dysbiosis of gut microbiota and their derived metabolites induced by chronic alcohol consumption. Strong connections were observed between EA-regulated genes, microbiota and metabolites. Finally, the causal relationship between the microbiome and behavioral changes was further confirmed through antibiotic treatment and fecal microbiota transplantation experiments. Overall, our study provides innovative evidence supporting the role of EA in improving AICSD via regulation of the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction signaling pathway through the microbiota-mediated CCl21-CCR7 axis. These findings offer valuable insights into both EA-based interventions as well as microbial interventions against AICSD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Atherosclerosis particularly due to high circulating level of low-density lipoprotein is a major cause of cardiovascular diseases. Ellagic acid is a natural polyphenolic compound rich in pomegranates and berries. Our previous study showed that ellagic acid improved functionality of reverse cholesterol transport in murine model of atherosclerosis. The aim of this study is to investigate whether ellagic acid inhibited inflammation-associated atherosclerotic plaque formation in cholesterol-fed apolipoprotein E (apoE)-knockout (KO) mice. MATERIALS/METHODS: Wild type mice and apoE-KO mice were fed a cholesterol-rich Paigen diet for 10 weeks to induce severe atherosclerosis. Concurrently, 10 mg/kg ellagic acid was orally administered to the apoE-KO mice. Plaque lesion formation and lipid deposition were examined by staining with hematoxylin and eosin, Sudan IV and oil red O. RESULTS: The plasma leukocyte profile of cholesterol-fed mice was not altered by apoE deficiency. Oral administration of ellagic acid attenuated plaque lesion formation and lipid deposition in the aorta tree of apoE-KO mice. Ellagic acid substantially reduced plasma levels of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule and interferon-γ in Paigen diet-fed apoE-KO mice. When 10 mg/kg ellagic acid was administered to cholesterol-fed apoE-KO mice, the levels of CD68 and MCP-1 were strongly reduced in aorta vessels. The protein expression level of nitric oxide synthase-2 (NOS2) in the aorta was highly enhanced by supplementation of ellagic acid to apoE-KO mice, but the expression level of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the aorta was reduced. Furthermore, ellagic acid diminished the increased aorta expression of the inflammatory adhesion molecules in cholesterol-fed apoE-KO mice. The treatment of ellagic acid inhibited the scavenger receptor-B1 expression in the aorta of apoE-KO mice, while the cholesterol efflux-related transporters were not significantly changed. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ellagic acid may be an atheroprotective compound by attenuating apoE deficiency-induced vascular inflammation and reducing atherosclerotic plaque lesion formation."

      "abstract": "This study investigates the potential of ellagic acid (EA) to mitigate the effects of drought and aluminum (Al3+) stresses in maize by examining various morpho-physiochemical parameters and gene expressions. Maize (Zea mays L.) serves as a crucial global food source, but its growth and productivity are significantly hindered by drought and aluminum (Al3+) stresses, which lead to impaired root development, elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), diminished photosynthetic efficiency, and reduced water and mineral absorption. Recently, ellagic acid (EA), a polyphenolic compound with potent antioxidant properties, has been identified for its role in regulating plant growth and enhancing stress tolerance mechanisms. However, the specific mechanisms through which EA contributes to Al3+ and/or drought tolerance in plants remain largely unknown. The present study was conducted to examine the defensive role of EA (100 μg/mL) in some morpho-physiochemical parameters and the expression profiles of some stress-related genes (ZmCPK22, ZmXTH1, ZmHIPP4, ZmSGR, ZmpsbA, ZmAPX1, and ZmGST1) in drought (polyethylene glycol-6000 (PEG-6000), - 0.6 MPa) and aluminum chloride (AlCl3, 60 μM) stressed Zea mays Ada 523 grown in nutrient solution. Our results indicated that drought and aluminum chloride stresses affected root length, shoot height, H2O2 content, chlorophyll content (SPAD), electrolyte leakage (EL), and relative water content (RWC) of maize with several significant (P < 0.05) shifts up and down. Conversely, EA (100 μg/mL) treatment had a mitigating effect on these parameters. Moreover, EA also mitigated the antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX)), and regulated the expressions of aforementioned genes. These findings determined that EA treatment could efficiently improve the gene expressions and morpho-physiochemical parameters under drought and/or Al3+ stresses, thereby increasing the seedlings' adaptability to these stresses.",

      "abstract": "Oryza sativa is a globally recognized staple food, rich in essential phyto-phenolic compounds such as γ-Oryzanol (OZ), Ferulic acid (FA), and Ellagic acid (EA). These phytochemicals are known for their potential to beneficially modulate molecular biochemistry. The present investigation aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective and cognitive enhancement effects of Oryza sativa phyto-phenolics in a model of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) induced by Aβ (1-42) in animals. In-silico studies suggested that FA, OZ, and EA have target specificity for Aβ, with EA being further selected based on its potent in-vitro Aβ anti-aggregatory effects for exploring neurodegenerative conditions. The in-vivo experiments demonstrated that EA exerts therapeutic effects in Aβ-induced EOAD, modulating both biochemical and behavioral outcomes. EA treatment at two dose levels, EA70 and EA140 (70 μM and 140 μM, respectively, administered i.c.v.), significantly counteracted Aβ aggregation and modulated the Ca2⁺/Calpain/GSK-3β/CDK5 signaling pathways, exhibiting anti-tauopathy effects. Additionally, EA was shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects by preventing astroglial activation, modulating FAIM-L expression, and protecting against TNF-α-induced apoptotic signals. Moreover, the neuromodulatory effects of EA were attributed to the regulation of CREB levels, Dnm-1 expression, and synaptophysin levels, thereby enhancing LTP and synaptic plasticity. EA also induced beneficial cytological and behavioral changes, improving both long-term and short-term spatial memory as well as associative learning behavior in the animal model, which underscores its cognitive enhancement properties."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previous studies suggest that titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) induce liver injury, possibly due to oxidative stress and inflammation. Ellagic acid (EA) is a dietary polyphenol extracted from natural sources and possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Nonetheless, the efficacy of EA in mitigating liver injury induced by TiO2 NPs remains to be elucidated. METHODS: Primary hepatocytes and L02 cells were cultured with 45 μM EA and 10 μg/ml TiO2 NPs. Mice were orally administered TiO2 NPs (150 mg kg-1) and EA (25/50/100 mg kg-1) for eight weeks. sulforaphane (SFN) as a positive control to evaluate the inhibitory effect of EA on TiO2 NP-induced liver injury (SFN 10 mg kg-1). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was employed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying oxidative stress, inflammation, and liver fibrosis. RESULTS: We assessed the impact of EA on cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis in both cells and mice exposed to TiO2 NPs for an extended period. Our findings indicated that EA had a protective effect on TiO2 NP-exposed hepatocytes, reducing cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Furthermore, EA treatment markedly reduced serum aminotransferase levels in mice exposed to TiO2 NPs. Furthermore, EA treatment notably reduced hepatic stress response, inflammation, and fibrosis in mice. The treatment of EA demonstrates non-inferiority compared to SFN. The protective effects of EA were attributed to the upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), EA promoted the translocation and phosphorylation of Nrf2, as indicated by the finding that Nfe2l2 shRNA and inhibition of Nrf2 by ML385 reversed the EA-induced hepatoprotective effects in TiO2 NP-exposed hepatocytes and mice. CONCLUSION: EA significantly mitigated liver injury induced by TiO2 NPs. Importantly, we identified that the nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of Nrf2 are the primary mechanisms through which EA alleviates liver injury resulting from exposure to TiO2 NPs. As a natural activator of Nrf2, EA emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for treating TiO2 NPs-induced liver injury, further enhancing our understanding of its potential as a hepatoprotective agent and its underlying molecular mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Skeletal muscle regeneration is impaired in elderly. An oxidative stress-induced decrease in differentiation capacity of muscle satellite cells is a key factor in this process. The aim of this study is to investigate whether orange polyphenol hesperetin and pomegranate polyphenol ellagic acid enhance myoblast differentiation in the presence and absence of oxidative stress, and to explore underlying mechanisms. METHODS: C2C12 myoblasts were proliferated for 24 h and differentiated for 120 h while exposed to hesperetin (5, 20, 50 μM), ellagic acid (0.05, 0.1 μM) or a combination (20 μM hesperetin, 0.05 μM ellagic acid) with and without oxidative stress-inducing compound menadione (9 μM) during 24 h of proliferation and during the first 5 h of differentiation. The number of proliferating cells was assessed using fluorescent labeling of incorporated 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine. Myosin heavy chain expression was assessed by fluorescence microscopy and cell fusion index was calculated. Furthermore, protein expression of phosphorylated p38 and myomixer were assessed using Western blot. RESULTS: None of the compounds induced effects on cell proliferation. Without menadione, 50 μM hesperetin increased fusion index by 12.6% compared to control (p < 0.01), while ellagic acid did not affect measured parameters of differentiation. Menadione treatment did not change myosin heavy chain expression and fusion index. In combination with menadione, 20 μM hesperetin increased myosin heavy chain expression by 35% (p < 0.01) and fusion index by 7% (p = 0.04) compared to menadione. Furthermore, the combination of menadione with hesperetin and ellagic acid increased myosin heavy chain expression by 35% compared to menadione (p = 0.02). Hesperetin and ellagic acid did not change p38 phosphorylation and myomixer expression compared to control, while treatment with menadione increased p38 phosphorylation (p < 0.01) after 5 h and decreased myomixer expression (p = 0.04) after 72 h of differentiation. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION: Hesperetin increased myosin heavy chain expression in the presence of oxidative stress induced by menadione, and increased cell fusion both in the presence and absence of menadione. Ellagic acid did not affect the measured parameters of myoblast differentiation. Therefore, hesperetin should be considered as nutritional prevention or treatment strategy to maintain muscle function in age-related diseases such as sarcopenia. Future research should focus on underlying mechanisms and translation of these results to clinical practice."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myocardial infarction (MI) is the main contributor to most cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and the available post-treatment clinical therapeutic options are limited. The development of nanoscale drug delivery systems carrying natural small molecules provides biotherapies that could potentially offer new treatments for reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced damage in MI. Considering the stability and reduced toxicity of gold-phenolic core-shell nanoparticles, this study aims to develop ellagic acid-functionalized gold nanoparticles (EA-AuNPs) to overcome these limitations. RESULTS: We have successfully synthesized EA-AuNPs with enhanced biocompatibility and bioactivity. These core-shell gold nanoparticles exhibit excellent ROS-scavenging activity and high dispersion. The results from a label-free imaging method on optically transparent zebrafish larvae models and micro-CT imaging in mice indicated that EA-AuNPs enable a favorable excretion-based metabolism without overburdening other organs. EA-AuNPs were subsequently applied in cellular oxidative stress models and MI mouse models. We found that they effectively inhibit the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and the elevation of cardiac enzyme activities, thereby ameliorating oxidative stress injuries in MI mice. Further investigations of oxylipin profiles indicated that EA-AuNPs might alleviate myocardial injury by inhibiting ROS-induced oxylipin level alterations, restoring the perturbed anti-inflammatory oxylipins. CONCLUSIONS: These findings collectively emphasized the protective role of EA-AuNPs in myocardial injury, which contributes to the development of innovative gold-phenolic nanoparticles and further advances their potential medical applications.",

      "abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers are a significant global health concern with diverse etiologies and limited treatment options. Ellagic acid (EA), a natural polyphenolic compound, exhibits promising anticancer properties against various GI malignancies. In this article, we have reviewed recent research on the anticancer potential of EA across esophageal, gastric, colorectal, pancreatic, and liver cancers. In esophageal cancer, EA inhibits the formation of O6-methylguanine (O6-meGua) adducts induced by carcinogens like N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA), thereby suppressing tumor growth. Additionally, EA inhibits STAT3 signaling and stabilizes tumor suppressor proteins, showing potential as an anti-esophageal cancer agent. In gastric cancer, EA regulates multiple pathways involved in cell proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis, including the p53 and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. It also demonstrates anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, making it a promising therapeutic candidate against gastric cancer. In colorectal cancer (CRC), EA inhibits cell proliferation, induces apoptosis, and modulates the Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/Akt pathways, suggesting its efficacy in preventing CRC progression. Furthermore, EA has shown promise in pancreatic cancer by inhibiting nuclear factor-kappa B, inducing apoptosis, and suppressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In liver cancer, EA exhibits radio-sensitizing effects, inhibits inflammatory pathways, and modulates the tumor microenvironment, offering potential therapeutic benefits against hepatocellular carcinoma. Studies on EA potential in combination therapies and the development of targeted delivery systems are required for enhanced efficacy against gastrointestinal cancers."

      "abstract": "Fever is one of the most common clinical conditions and is characterized by pyrogenic infection, malignancy, inflammation, and tissue damage, among others. Ellagic acid (EA) can inhibit the expression of related proteins on the pathway by blocking the nuclear factor kappa-B(NF-κB) signaling pathway, inhibit the levels of pro-inflammatory factors interleukin-1β(IL-1β), interleukin-6(IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α), increase the level of anti-inflammatory factor IL-10, and effectively alleviate inflammatory symptoms. In addition, EA can also reduce the levels of malondialdehyde(MDA) and nitric oxide(NO) in the body, increase the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and catalase(CAT), scavenge oxidative free radicals, inhibit lipid oxidation, and achieve antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects. The purpose of this study was to establish the relationship between EA and various inflammatory markers, such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, prostaglandin E2(PGE2), and cyclic adenosine monophosphate(cAMP), and clarify the mechanism of the cyclooxidase-2(COX-2)/NF-κB signaling pathway. Combined with the metabolomics analysis, our study revealed the effects of EA on multiple endogenous biomarkers, reflecting the characteristics of a multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway mechanism. Compared to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- treated animals, subsequent administration of EA significantly lowered the LPS-induced rectal temperature increase (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01), significantly increased serum SOD and GSH levels (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01), and significantly decreased serum MDA, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). In addition, compared to LPS-treated animals, subsequent administration of EA significantly decreased cerebrospinal fluid cAMP and PGE2 levels (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01), significantly decreased cAMP, significantly increased 5-HT levels (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01), and significantly down-regulated p-NF-κB p65 and COX-2 protein levels in the hypothalamus. Subsequent gas chromatography mass spectrometry(GC-MS) metabolite analysis indicated that 12 differential metabolites were detected in serum isolated 4 h after LPS treatment, and 10 differential metabolites were detected in serum collected 7 h after LPS treatment. Next, Pearson correlation analysis was used to systematically characterize the relationship between the identified metabolites and TNF-α, IL-6, MDA, SOD, PGE2, and cAMP. The levels of propionic acid, pyridine, and L-valine were up-regulated by EA, which inhibited the expression of MDA, IL-1β, and TNF-α and increased the activity of GSH. The levels of inositol, urea, and 2-monopalmitin were down-regulated by EA, which inhibited the expression of MDA, IL-1β, and TNF-α, increased the activity of SOD and GSH, reduced the inflammatory response, and alleviated the oxidative stress state. Combined with the results of the metabolic pathway analysis, we suggest that the pathways of the galactose metabolism, synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies, as well as ascorbic acid and aldehyde acid metabolism are closely related to the antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects of EA. Our study established the relationship between EA and various inflammatory markers, such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, PGE2, and cAMP, and clarified the mechanism of the COX-2/NF-κB signaling pathway. Combined with the metabolomics analysis, our study revealed the effects of EA on multiple endogenous biomarkers, reflecting the characteristics of a multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway mechanism."

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterised by inflammation and cartilage degeneration. Ellagic acid (EA) might have therapeutic potential in OA, but its molecular mechanisms of action remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify the docking protein of EA in M1 macrophage-related pro-inflammation in OA. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify ellagic acid's potential targets among OA-related dysregulated genes. THP-1 cells were induced into M0 and polarised into M1 macrophages for in vitro studies. Mice knee models of OA were generated for in vivo studies. Results showed that PTGS2 (also known as COX-2) is a potential target of ellagic acid among OA-related dysregulated genes. EA has multiple low-energy binding sites on PTGS2, including sites containing amino acid residues critical for the enzyme's catalytic activity. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays confirmed the physical interaction between ellagic acid and recombinant PTGS2 protein, with a dissociation constant (KD) of 5.03 ± 0.84 μM. EA treatment suppressed PTGS2 expression and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in M1 macrophages. Besides, ellagic acid can directly inhibit PTGS2 enzyme activity, with an IC50 around 50 μM. Importantly, in a mouse model of OA, ellagic acid administration alleviated disease severity, reduced collagen II degradation and MMP13 generation, and decreased serum PGE2 levels. Collectively, these results suggest that PTGS2 is a key target of ellagic acid's anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective effects in OA.",

      "abstract": "Arsenic, a neurotoxic metalloid, poses significant health risks. However, ellagic acid, renowned for its antioxidant properties, has shown potential in neuroprotection. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of ellagic acid against arsenic-induced neuronal ferroptosis and cognitive impairment and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Using an arsenic-exposed Wistar rat model and an arsenic-induced HT22 cells model, we assessed cognitive ability, measured serum and brain arsenic levels, and evaluated pathological damage through histological analysis and transmission electron microscopy. Additionally, we examined oxidative stress and iron ion levels using GSH, MDA, ROS and tissue iron biochemical kits, and analyzed the expression of ferroptosis-related markers using western blot and qRT-PCR. Our results revealed that arsenic exposure increased both serum and brain arsenic levels, resulting in hippocampal pathological damage and subsequent decline in learning and memory abilities. Arsenic-induced neuronal ferroptosis was mediated by the inhibition of the xCT/GSH/GPX4/Nrf2 signaling axis and disruption of iron metabolism. Notably, ellagic acid intervention effectively reduced serum and brain arsenic levels, ameliorated neuronal damage, and improved oxidative stress, ferroptosis, and cognitive impairment. These beneficial effects were associated with the activation of the Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway, upregulation of GPX4 expression, and enhanced iron ion excretion. In conclusion, ellagic acid demonstrates promising neuroprotective effects against arsenic-induced neurotoxicity by mitigating neuronal ferroptosis and cognitive impairment.",

Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop alternative strategies to combat multi-drug-resistant bacterial infections. In this study, gold nanoparticles modified with ellagic acid (EA-AuNPs) were prepared using a simple and mild one-pot hydrothermal process. EA-AuNPs demonstrated high bactericidal efficacy and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities against clinical isolates of the antibiotic-resistant ESKAPE pathogens. Furthermore, EA-AuNPs effectively disperse biofilms of multi-drug-resistant bacteria. Additionally, EA-AuNPs mitigated inflammatory responses at the bacterial infection sites. The combined bactericidal and anti-inflammatory treatment with EA-AuNPs resulted in faster curing of peritonitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus in mice compared to treatment with free EA or gentamicin. Moreover, transcriptome analysis revealed that EA-AuNPs exhibited a multi-targeting mechanism, making resistance development in pathogens more challenging than traditional antibiotics that recognize specific cellular targets. Overall, EA-AuNPs emerged as a promising antimicrobial agent against multi-drug-resistant bacterial infections.",

      "abstract": "Heat stress has been shown to have a detrimental impact on testicular activity and spermatogenesis. Ellagic acid is a plant-derived organic compound that has a variety of biological functions. Thus, it is believed that ellagic acid may improve heat-stressed testicular dysfunction. There has been no research on the impact of ellagic acid on heat-stressed testicular dysfunction. The mice were divided into 4 groups. The first group was the normal control group (CN), and the second received heat stress (HS) by submerging the lower body for 15 min in a water bath with a thermostatically controlled temperature kept at 43°C (HS), and the third and fourth groups were subjected to heat-stress similar to group two and given two different dosages of ellagic acid (5 mg/kg (EH5) and 50 mg/kg (EH50) for 14 days. Ellagic acid at a dose of 50 mg/kg improved the level of circulating testosterone (increased 3βHSD) and decreases the oxidative stress. The testicular and epididymal architecture along with sperm parameters also showed improvement. Ellagic acid treatment significantly increases the germ cell proliferation (GCNA, BrdU staining) and Bcl2 expression and decreases active caspase 3 expression. Heat stress downregulated the expression of AR, ER-α and ER-β, and treatment with ellagic acid increased the expression of ER-α and ER-β markers in the 50 mg/kg treatment group. Thus, our finding suggests that ellagic acid ameliorates heat-induced testicular impairment through modulating testosterone synthesis, germ cell proliferation, and oxidative stress. These effects could be manifested by regulating androgen and estrogen receptors. However, the two doses showed differential effects of some parameters, which require further investigation.",

To address this issue, herein an innovative therapeutic strategy that integrates photothermal anticancer and normal cell protection is developed. A new type of nitrogen-doped carbon dot (ET-CD) has been synthesized in one step by hydrothermal method using ellagic acid and L-tyrosine as reaction precursors. The as-prepared ET-CD exhibits high photothermal conversion efficiency and good photothermal stability. After intravenous injection, ET-CD can accumulate at the tumor site and the hyperthermia generated under near infrared laser irradiation effectively ablates tumor tissues, thereby significantly inhibiting tumor growth. Importantly, owing to the inherited antioxidant activity from ellagic acid, ET-CD can remove reactive oxygen and nitrogen species produced in the body and reduce the levels of inflammatory factors induced by oxidative stress, so as to alleviate the damage caused by heat-induced inflammation to normal cells and tissues while photothermal anticancer. These attractive features of ET-CD may open the exploration of innovative therapeutic strategies to promote the clinical application of PTT.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a worldwide-concerning disease with a rising prevalence. There are many ongoing studies aimed at finding new and effective treatments. Ellagic acid (EA) is a natural polyphenolic compound abundant in certain fruits and vegetables. It is the objective of this investigation to assess the effectiveness and preventive mechanisms of EA on DM and associated complications. This systematic review used PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar as search databases using a predetermined protocol from inception to June 2024. We assessed all related English studies, including in vitro, in vivo, and clinical trials. EA counteracted DM and its complications by diminishing inflammation, oxidative stress, hyperglycemia, apoptosis, insulin resistance, obesity, lipid profile, and histopathological alterations. Several mechanisms contributed to the anti-diabetic effect of EA, the most significant being the upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), protein kinase B, and downregulation of nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-κB) gene expression. EA also revealed protective effects against diabetes complications, such as diabetic-induced hepatic damage, testicular damage, endothelial dysfunction, muscle dysfunction, retinopathy, nephropathy, cardiomyopathy, neuropathy, and behavioral deficit. Administration of EA could have various protective effects in preventing, treating, and alleviating DM and its complications. Although it could be considered a cost-effective, safe, and accessible treatment, to fully establish the effectiveness of EA as a medication for DM, it is crucial to conduct further well-designed studies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism (GALM) serve as both a cause and an inducer for the development of the disease. Improvement and treatment of GALM are an important stage to prevent the occurrence and development of the disease. However, current clinical treatment for GALM is limited. Ellagic acid (EA), a common polyphenol present in foods, has been shown to improve abnormalities in GALM observed in patients suffering from metabolic diseases. OBJECTIVE: This study used a meta-analysis method to systematically assess the effects of EA on GALM. METHOD: As of November 8, 2023, a comprehensive search was conducted across 5 databases, namely, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which EA served as the primary intervention for diseases related to GALM. The risk of bias within the included studies was assessed according to the Cochrane Handbook. All statistical analyzes were performed using RevMan 5.4 software. RESULTS: In this study, a total of 482 articles were retrieved, resulting in the inclusion of 10 RCTs in the meta-analysis. The results showed that EA could reduce fasting blood glucose (FBG) (p = 0.008), increase insulin secretion (p = 0.01), improve insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) (p = 0.003), decrease triglyceride (TG) (p = 0.004), and reduce cholesterol (Chol) (p = 0.04) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL-c) (p = 0.0004). EA had no significant effect on waist circumference (WC), body weight (BW), body mass index (BMI), 2 hours after prandial blood glucose (2 h-PG), total cholesterol (TC), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL-c). CONCLUSIONS: The effect of improvement in glucose and lipids of EA was closely related to the dose and the intervention time. EA can improve GALM caused by diseases. To corroborate the findings of this study and improve the reliability of the results, EA is imperative to refine the research methodology and increase the sample size in future investigations."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mediterranean diet rich in polyphenolic compounds holds great promise to prevent and alleviate multiple sclerosis (MS), a central nervous system autoimmune disease associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis. Health-promoting effects of natural polyphenols with low bioavailability could be attributed to gut microbiota reconstruction. However, its underlying mechanism of action remains elusive, resulting in rare therapies have proposed for polyphenol-targeted modulation of gut microbiota for the treatment of MS. RESULTS: We found that oral ellagic acid (EA), a natural polyphenol rich in the Mediterranean diet, effectively halted the progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of MS, via regulating a microbiota-metabolites-immunity axis. EA remodeled the gut microbiome composition and particularly increased the relative abundances of short-chain fatty acids -producing bacteria like Alloprevotella. Propionate (C3) was most significantly up-regulated by EA, and integrative modeling revealed a strong negative correlation between Alloprevotella or C3 and the pathological symptoms of EAE. Gut microbiota depletion negated the alleviating effects of EA on EAE, whereas oral administration of Alloprevotella rava mimicked the beneficial effects of EA on EAE. Moreover, EA directly promoted Alloprevotella rava (DSM 22548) growth and C3 production in vitro. The cell-free supernatants of Alloprevotella rava co-culture with EA suppressed Th17 differentiation by modulating acetylation in cell models. C3 can alleviate EAE development, and the mechanism may be through inhibiting HDAC activity and up-regulating acetylation thereby reducing inflammatory cytokines secreted by pathogenic Th17 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies EA as a novel and potentially effective prebiotic for improving MS and other autoimmune diseases via the microbiota-metabolites-immunity axis. Video Abstract.",

      "abstract": "Ellagic acid (EA) is a natural polyphenol and possesses excellent in vivo bioactivity and antioxidant behaviors, which play an important role in the treatment of oxidative stress-related diseases, such as cancer. Additionally, EA is also known as a skin-whitening ingredient. The content of EA would determine its efficacy. Therefore, the accurate analysis of EA content can provide more information for the scientific consumption of EA-rich foods and cosmetics. Nevertheless, the analysis of EA in these samples is challenging due to the low concentration level and the presence of interfering components with high abundance. Molecularly imprinted polymers are highly efficient pretreatment materials in achieving specific recognition of target molecules. However, the traditional template molecule (EA) could not be absolutely removed. Hence, template leakage continues to occur during the sample preparation process, leading to a lack of accuracy in the quantification of EA in actual samples, particularly for trace analytes. In addition, another drawback of EA as an imprinting template is that EA possesses poor solubility and a high price. Gallic acid (GA), called dummy templates, was employed for the synthesis of MIPs as a solution to these challenges. The approach used in this study was boronate affinity-based oriented surface imprinting. The prepared dummy-imprinted nanoparticles exhibited several significant advantages, such as good specificity, high binding affinity ((4.89 ± 0.46) × 10-5 M), high binding capacity (6.56 ± 0.35 mg/g), fast kinetics (6 min), and low binding pH (pH 5.0) toward EA. The reproducibility of the dummy-imprinted nanoparticles was satisfactory. The dummy-imprinted nanoparticles could still be reused even after six adsorption-desorption cycles. In addition, the recoveries of the proposed method for EA at three spiked levels of analysis in strawberry and pineapple were 91.0-106.8% and 93.8-104.0%, respectively, which indicated the successful application to real samples.",

Excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulated in a neuronal cell can lead to OS, producing cell injury and death. Seeking nanoantioxidants against AD-related oxidative stress has attracted a lot of attention, especially those potential antioxidant agents derived from natural polyphenols. However, the transformation of abundant plant polyphenols to antioxidative biomaterials against OS is still challenging. In this work, we report a new method to transform amorphous tannic acid (TA) into tailorable shaped ellagic acid (EA) crystalline particles without using an organic solvent. EA crystalline particles were generated from TA, which underwent a chemical transformation, in situ metal phenolic coordination and acid-induced assembly process, and the size and shape could be controlled by varying the amount of acid. As-prepared EA crystalline particles showed excellent stability in water and lysosomal mimicking fluid and possess unique fluorescence properties and a strong response in mass spectrometry, which is beneficial for their imaging analysis in cells and tissues. More importantly, EA particles have shown significant H2O2-related ROS scavenging ability, a high cellular uptake capacity, an excellent neuroprotective effect in PC12 cells, a high drug loading capacity and BBB permeability to enter the brain. Our study suggested that the EA crystalline particles show great potential for OS-mediated AD treatment.",

However, achieving superior photocatalytic CDRR performance is hindered by the challenges of low charge separation efficiency, poor stability, and high preparation costs associated with COFs. Herein, in this work, we utilized perfluorinated metallophthalocyanine (MPcF16) and the organic biomolecule compound ellagic acid (EA) as building blocks to actualize functional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) named EPM-COF (M = Co, Ni, Cu). The designed EPCo-COF, featuring cobalt metal active sites, demonstrated an impressive CO production rate and selectivity in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CDRR). Moreover, following alkaline treatment (EPCo-COF-AT), the COF exposed carboxylic acid anion (COO-) and hydroxyl group (OH), thereby enhancing the electron-donating capability of EA. This modification achieved a heightened CO production rate of 17.7 mmol g-1 h-1 with an outstanding CO selectivity of 97.8% in efficient photocatalytic CDRR. Theoretical calculations further illustrated that EPCo-COF-AT functionalized with COO- and OH can effectively alleviate the energy barriers involved in the CDRR process, which facilitates the proton-coupled electron transfer processes and enhances the photocatalytic performance on the cobalt active sites within EPCo-COF-AT."

Paeonia lactiflora Pallas (PL), which is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine, enhances blood function and promotes hair growth, and ellagic acid (EA), a polyphenol in PL extract, shows strong antioxidant, anti-aging, and anti-inflammatory properties and also plays a role in the treatment of various skin conditions. However, its role and mechanism of action in AGA remain unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: To determine whether EA can rescue slow hair regeneration by regulating dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-induced ferroptosis in AGA mice and clarify the effect of EA on DHT-induced ferroptosis in dermal papilla cells (DPCs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice were used to establish a DHT-induced AGA mouse model, whereas DPCs were used to establish a DHT-induced cellular model. Thereafter, we investigated the therapeutic mechanism of action of EA via immunofluorescence, western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and molecular docking. RESULTS: EA stimulated hair regeneration in mice and reversed DHT-induced increases in iron content, lipid peroxidation, and DHT-induced mitochondrial dysfunction by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Further, β-catenin knockdown suppressed the inhibitory effect of EA on DHT-induced ferroptosis in DPCs. CONCLUSION: EA inhibits DHT-induced ferroptosis and promotes hair regrowth in mice by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Thus, it has potential for use as a treatment option for AGA.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is in epidemic proportions in many parts of the world, contributing to increasing rates of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD represents a range of conditions from the initial stage of fatty liver to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can progress to severe fibrosis, through to hepatocellular carcinoma. There currently exists no treatment for the long-term management of NAFLD/NASH, however, dietary interventions have been investigated for the treatment of NASH, including several polyphenolic compounds. Ellagic acid is one such polyphenolic compound. Nutraceutical food abundant in ellagic acid undergoes initial hydrolysis to free ellagic acid within the stomach and small intestine. The proposed mechanism of action of ellagic acid extends beyond its initial therapeutic potential, as it is further broken down by the gut microbiome into urolithin. Both ellagic acid and urolithin have been found to alleviate oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis, which are associated with NAFLD/NASH. While progress has been made in understanding the pharmacological and biological activity of ellagic acid and its involvement in NAFLD/NASH, it has yet to be fully elucidated. Thus, the aim of this review is to summarise the currently available literature elucidating the therapeutic potential of ellagic acid and its microbial-derived metabolite urolithin in NAFLD/NASH."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the antioxidant effect of Ellagic acid (EA) on wound healing in sodium hydroxide (NaOH)-induced corrosive esophageal burn injury. The interaction networks and functional annotations were conducted using Cytoscape software. A total of 24 Wistar albino rats were divided into control, corrosive esophageal burn (CEB) and CEB + EA groups. Burn injury was created by 20% NaOH and 30 mg/kg EA was per oral administered to rats. At the end of the 28-day experimental period, Malondialdehyde (MDA) content was measured. Esophageal tissue samples were processed for histological staining. The EA-target interaction network was revealed to be involved in regulating crucial cellular mechanisms for burn wound healing, with epidermal growth factor (EGF) identified as a central mediator. An increase in animal weight in the CEB + EA group was observed in the EA-treated group after CEB injury. Burn injury increased MDA content, but EA treatment decreased its level after CEB injury. Stenosis index, collagen degeneration, inflammation, fibrosis and necrosis levels were increased after CEB injury. EA treatment improved histopathology in the CEB + EA group compared to the CEB group. The expression of EGF was decreased in the CEB group but upregulated in the EA-treated group, suggesting a potential involvement of EA in cellular processes and tissue regeneration. EA, through its antioxidative and tissue regenerative properties, significantly contributes to alleviating the adverse effects of CEB injury, promoting wound healing."

      "abstract": "The metabolite urolithin A, a metabolite of the dietary polyphenol ellagic acid (EA), has significant health benefits for humans. However, studies on the gut microbiota involved in ellagic acid metabolism are limited. In this study, we conducted in vitro fermentation of EA using human intestinal microbiome combined with antibiotics (vancomycin, polymyxin B sulfate, and amphotericin B). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis demonstrated that the production capacity of urolithin A by gut microbiota co-treated with polymyxin B sulfate and amphotericin B (22.39 µM) was similar to that of untreated gut microbiota (24.26 µM). Macrogenomics (high-throughput sequencing) was used to analyze the composition and structure of the gut microbiota. The results showed that the abundance of Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, and Bifidobacterium bifidum in the gut microbiota without antibiotic treatment or co-treated with polymyxin B sulfate and amphotericin B during EA fermentation was higher than that in other antibiotic treatment gut microbiota. Therefore, B. longum, B. adolescentis, and B. bifidum may be new genera involved in the conversion of EA to urolithin A. In conclusion, the study revealed unique interactions between polyphenols and gut microbiota, deepening our understanding of the relationship between phenolic compounds like EA and the gut microbiota. These findings may contribute to the development of gut bacteria as potential probiotics for further development. KEY POINTS: • Intestinal microbiome involved in ellagic acid metabolism. • Gram-positive bacteria in the intestinal microbiome are crucial for ellagic acid metabolism. • Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, and Bifidobacterium bifidum participate in ellagic acid metabolism.",

      "abstract": "The early myocardial response of hypertension is an elevation of angiotensin-II (Ang-II) concentration, leading to heart failure and cardiac hypertrophy. This hypertrophic event of the heart is mediated by the interaction of Ang type 1 receptors (AT-R1), thereby modulating NADPH oxidase activity in cardiomyocytes, which alters redox status in cardiomyocytes. Ellagic acid (EA) has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative capacities. Thus, EA has potential preventive effects on cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. In the last decades, because the protective effect of EA on Ang-II-induced hypertrophic responses is unclear, this study aims to investigate the protective effect of EA in cardiomyocytes. H9c2 cells were treated to Ang-II 1 μM for 24 h to induce cellular damage. We found that EA protected against Ang-II-increased cell surface area and pro-hypertrophic gene expression in H9c2. EA reduced Ang-II-caused AT-R1 upregulation, thereby inhibiting oxidative stress NADPH oxidase activation. EA mitigated Ang-II-enhanced p38 and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. Moreover, EA treatment under Ang-II stimulation also reversed NF-κB activity and iNOS expression. This study shows that EA protects against Ang-II-induced myocardial hypertrophy and attenuates oxidative stress through reactive oxygen species-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways in H9c2 cells. Thus, EA may be an effective compound for preventing Ang-II-induced myocardial hypertrophy.",

      "abstract": "Ellagic acid (EA), a polyphenolic constituent of plant origin, has been thoroughly investigated for its hypothesised pharmacological properties among which antioxidant and neuroprotective activities are included. The present study was designed to explore whether EA could attenuate heavy metal (cadmium, mercury, and lead)-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, which were utilized as a model system for brain cells. MTT and LDH assays were performed to examine the viability of the SH-SY5Y cells after exposure to Cd, Hg, and Pb (either individually or in combination with EA) as well as the effects of necrotic cell death, respectively. Furthermore, 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), a cell-based assay, was performed to determine whether EA could protect SH-SY5Y from heavy metal-induced oxidative stress. Results allowed us to assess the capability of EA to enhance the number of viable SH-SY5Y cells after exposure to heavy metal toxicity. Pre-treatment with EA showed a considerable, concentration-dependent, cytoprotective effect, particularly against Cd2+-induced toxicity. This effect was confirmed through the reduction of LDH release after the simultaneous cell treatment with Cd2+ and EA compared with Cd2+-treated cells. Furthermore, a significant, concentration-dependent decrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, induced by H2O2 or heavy metals, was observed in the same model. Overall, the obtained results provide further insight into the protective role of EA against heavy metal-induced neurotoxicity and oxidative stress, thus indicating the potential beneficial effects of the consumption of EA-rich foods. However, to confirm its effects, well-designed human randomized controlled trials are needed to fill the existing gap between experimental and clinical research."

      "abstract": "The present study was conducted to decipher the protection effects of ellagic acid (EA) on piglets infected with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Thirty 7-day-old piglets were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: control, PEDV, and EA + PEDV groups. After a 3-day period of adaption, piglets in the EA + PEDV group were orally administered with 20 mg/kg·BW EA during days 4-11 of the trial. On day 8, piglets were orally administered with PEDV at a dose of 106 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose) per pig. Additionally, intestinal porcine epithelial (IPEC-1) cells infected with PEDV were used to investigate the anti-PEDV effect of EA in vitro. The results showed that EA at a dose of 10-40 μmol/L increased the viability of PEDV-infected IPEC-1 cells, and EA administration mitigated intestinal edema in piglets challenged with PEDV. Further studies indicated that EA treatment significantly increased the proportion of white blood cells in blood and concentrations of IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-10 in the serum, but decreased the TNF-α content and gene expression of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and CXCL2 in the jejunum. Moreover, EA intervention considerably elevated the activity of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), but decreased the H2O2 concentration in the ileum of piglets. Importantly, EA suppressed the increased expression of antiviral-related genes and proteins (including MXI, ISG15, HSP70, and p-IRF7) induced by PEDV challenge in the jejunum. Furthermore, PEDV infection increased the protein abundance of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3, which were further enhanced by EA supplementation. In conclusion, our results revealed that EA could promote the restoration of intestinal homeostasis by regulating the interferon pathway that was interrelated with the activation of JAK2/STAT3 signaling. These findings provide theoretical basis for the use of EA as a therapy targeting PEDV infection in piglets.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sorafenib is a classic molecular targeted drug approved for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therapy. However, a poor response rate and increasing resistance to sorafenib make its therapeutic efficacy suboptimal. Combination treatment with an agent capable of potentiating sorafenib sensitivity may be a promising solution. AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the synergistic effect of ellagic acid (EA), a natural polyphenol, and sorafenib on HCC. METHODS: CCK-8, EdU incorporation and colony formation assays were used to study the effect of EA on HCC cell proliferation. Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry in HCC cells and TUNEL assay in xenograft tumors. Transcriptome analysis was utilized to investigate alterations in signaling pathways with EA treatment. A xenograft mouse model was used to confirm the synergistic effect of sorafenib and EA on HCC tumors in vivo. RESULTS: We found that EA inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in both HCC cells and xenograft tumors. Mechanistically, EA treatment reduced the activation of the MAPK and Akt/mTOR signaling pathways in HCC cells. Furthermore, combined EA and sorafenib treatment further inhibited the MAPK and Akt/mTOR signaling pathways compared to EA or sorafenib alone. EA synergistically potentiated the anticancer activity of sorafenib against HCC both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: EA inhibits HCC growth by inducing apoptosis through attenuation of the MAPK and Akt/mTOR signaling pathways. EA potentiates the response of HCC tumors to sorafenib both in vitro and in vivo, an effect that may be attributed to further inhibition of the MAPK and Akt/mTOR signaling pathways. These results suggest that EA is an effective adjuvant option for sorafenib therapy."

      "abstract": "Characterized by bone mass loss, osteoporosis is an orthopedic disease typically found in postmenopausal women and aging individuals. Consistent with its pathogenesis summarized as an imbalance in bone formation/resorption, current pharmacologically therapeutic strategies for osteoporosis mainly aim to promote bone formation or/and inhibit bone resorption. However, few effective drugs with mild clinical side effects have been developed, making it a well-concerned issue to seek appropriate drugs for osteoporosis. In this study, we investigated the effect of ellagic acid (EA) on osteogenesis in vitro and in vivo and searched for its molecular mechanism. Here, we showed that EA promoted osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, increased mRNA and protein expression levels of osteoblast marker genes Runt-related transcription factor2, Osterix, Alkaline phosphatase, Collagen type I alpha 1, Osteopontin and Osteocalcin. Furthermore, ovariectomized mice with orally administered EA (10 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg) had significantly higher bone mass than those in controls. And experiments such as fluorescence double-labeling and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay also demonstrated that EA could promote osteogenesis in vivo. To probe the molecular mechanism of EA, we performed RNA sequencing analysis using EA-treated BMSCs. Significant up-regulation of SMAD2/3 transcription factors was identified by RNA-seq, and it was confirmed in vitro that EA promoted bone formation by activating the SMAD2/3 signaling pathway. Evidence from our present experiments indicates that EA may be a promising candidate for clinical treatment for osteoporosis in future.",

Based on the results of this comprehensive review, EA has multiple effects on BC cells including (1) suppresses the growth of BC cells by arresting the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase, (2) suppresses migration, invasion, and metastatic, (3) stimulates apoptosis in MCF-7 cells via TGF-β/Smad3 signaling axis, (4) inhibits CDK6 that is important in cell cycle regulation, (5) binds to ACTN4 and induces its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, inducing decreased cell motility and invasion in BC cells, (6) inhibits the PI3K/AKT pathway, and (7) inhibits angiogenesis-associated activities including proliferation (reduces VEGFR-2 tyrosine kinase activity). In conclusion, EA exhibits anticancer activity through various molecular mechanisms that influence key cellular processes like apoptosis, cell cycle, angiogenesis, and metastasis in BC. However, further researches are essential to fully elucidate its molecular targets and implications for clinical applications."

Ellagic acid (EA) has many pharmacological effects including antioxidant, antithrombotic and neurorestoration activities. The aim of this study was evaluation of the effects of EA on motor and cognitive behaviors, hippocampal local field potential (LFP), brain oxidative stress in male rats with cerebral 2-vessel occlusion ischemia/reperfusion (2VO I/R). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight male Wistar rats (250-300 g) were assigned into six groups. 1) The Sham: rats were treated with DMSO10%/normal saline as solvent of EA 3 times daily for 1 week; 2) I/R+Veh; I/R rats received vehicle; 3-5) EA-treated groups: I/R rats received 50, 75, or 100 mg/kg EA; and 6) Cont+EA100: intact rats received EA. The cerebral 2VO I/R was made by the bilateral common carotid arteries closing for 20 min followed by reperfusion. The behavioral tests and hippocampal LFP recording were performed after treatment with EA. The oxidative stress parameters were assayed by special ELISA kits. RESULTS: Cerebral 2VO I/R significantly decreased motor coordination, memory and hippocampal LFP and significantly increased oxidative stress. Treatment with EA improved all I/R complications. CONCLUSION: The current findings showed that treatment of I/R rats with EA could reverse cognitive and motor functions, and improve the LFP and oxidative stress markers. So, effects of EA on cognitive and motor function may at least in part, be due to its antioxidative actions."

Furthermore, the reactive oxygen species and glutathione levels were significantly decreased and increased, respectively, and antioxidant genes (Nrf2, HO-1, CAT, and SOD1) were significantly upregulated in the 10 EA group. mRNA expression of developmental-related (CDX2, POU5F1, and SOX2) and anti-apoptotic (BCL2L1) genes was significantly upregulated in the 10 EA group, while mRNA expression of pro-apoptotic genes (BAK, FAS, and CASP3) was significantly downregulated. Ultimately, following somatic cell nuclear transfer, the blastocyst formation rate was significantly increased and the percentage of apoptotic cell in blastocysts was significantly decreased in the 10 EA group. In conclusion, addition of 10 EA to IVM medium improved oocyte maturation and the subsequent embryo development capacity through antioxidant mechanisms. These findings suggest that EA can enhance the efficiencies of assisted reproductive technologies.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder that affects women of reproductive age. It is characterized by irregular menstrual cycles, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries. The syndrome's etiology is multifactorial, involving genetic, hormonal, metabolic, and environmental factors. Given its diverse effects, managing PCOS requires a comprehensive approach. METHODS: This study employed a Sprague-Dawley rat model to investigate the effects of ellagic acid on polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Forty adult female rats were randomly divided into four groups: a control group, a healthy group receiving ellagic acid (200 mg/kg), a PCOS group, and an ellagic acid + PCOS group. PCOS was induced in the relevant groups through subcutaneous injection of estradiol valerate (2 mg/kg), and ellagic acid was administered via subcutaneous injections for 14 days. Blood samples were collected for hormone analysis using the ELISA method, and ovarian tissues were processed for histological examination. RESULT: Ellagic acid treatment showed reduced LH levels and restoration of follicular development, particularly primordial and graafian follicles, along with modulation of miRNA-21 expression. Moreover, ellagic acid exhibited positive effects on ovarian morphology, including decreased theca layer thickness, increased oocyte diameter, and improvements in antral and preovulatory follicles. This suggests ellagic acid's potential in addressing follicular development and oocyte quality in PCOS. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest ellagic acid as a potential complementary approach in PCOS management. While the study is promising, further research, including clinical trials, is required to elucidate ellagic acid's mechanisms and clinical efficacy in human PCOS subjects.",

      "abstract": "Drug resistance is one of the leading causes of treatment failure in current cancer chemotherapy. In addition to the classical drug efflux transporter-mediated chemoresistance, cancer cells with stemness features play a crucial role in escaping the maximum impact of chemotherapy. To sensitize cancer chemotherapy, in a novel approach, the hedgehog pathway inhibitor ellagic acid (EA) is coordinated with Cu2+ to develop nanoscale metal-organic frameworks (EA-Cu), which are then loaded with doxorubicin (DOX) and modified with targeted chondroitin sulfate (CS) to form the CS/E-C@DOX nanoplatform (CS/NPs). Notably, EA inhibits stemness maintenance by suppressing the hedgehog pathway, while Cu2+ further decreases stemness features of tumor cells by disrupting mitochondrial metabolism, effectively enhancing DOX-mediated chemotherapy. Meanwhile, EA can act synergistically with Cu2+ to cause mitochondrial dysfunction and cuproptosis, which effectively decreases ATP levels and subsequently suppresses the activity of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), thus reducing drug efflux and sensitizing DOX-mediated chemotherapy. Additionally, the attached CS endows CS/NPs with specific tumor targeting properties, whereas EA-Cu endows this nanoplatform with pH/glutathione (GSH) dual-responsive release behavior. Taken together, CS/NPs exhibited excellent antitumor effects by inducing cuproptosis and significantly inhibiting cancer cell stemness, which has great potential for overcoming cancer chemoresistance.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: (s): Metabolic syndrome is a collection of metabolic abnormalities that includes hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and obesity. Ellagic acid is found in various fruits and vegetables. It has been reported to have several pharmacological properties, such as antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, cardioprotective, chemopreventive, neuroprotective, gastroprotective, and antidiabetic. Our current study aims to shed light on the probable efficiency of ellagic acid in managing metabolic syndrome and its complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To prepare the present review, the databases or search engines utilized included Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar, and relevant articles have been gathered with no time limit until March 2023. RESULTS: Several investigations indicated that ellagic acid could be a potent compound for the treatment of many disorders such as diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia by various mechanisms, including increasing insulin secretion, insulin receptor substrate protein 1 expression, regulating glucose transporter 4, triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), attenuating tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and oxidative stress in related tissues. Furthermore, ellagic acid ameliorates mitochondrial function, upregulates uncoupling protein 1 (found in brown and white adipose tissues), and regulates blood levels of nitrate/nitrite and vascular relaxations in response to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside. CONCLUSION: Ellagic acid can treat or manage metabolic syndrome and associated complications, according to earlier studies. To validate the beneficial effects of ellagic acid on metabolic syndrome, additional preclinical and clinical research is necessary."

      "abstract": "The present study investigated the effects of ellagic acid, a type of polyphenol that does not have a glycan and is composed of four hydroxyl groups and two lactone functional groups, on porcine in vitro fertilization (IVF) by focusing on its anti-hyaluronidase activity. A comparative analysis of ellagic acid and apigenin, which is commonly used as a hyaluronidase inhibitor, was performed. It compared the effects of ellagic acid and apigenin on hyaluronidase activity at different concentrations. The results showed that 10, 20, and 40 μM ellagic acid strongly reduced hyaluronidase activity (P < 0.05). The addition of 20 μM ellagic acid, but not apigenin, to porcine IVF medium effectively reduced polyspermy without decreasing sperm penetration or the formation rates of male pronuclei in cumulus-free oocytes. However, neither ellagic acid nor apigenin affected the number of sperm that bound to zona pellucida (ZP) or the induction of zona hardening and protease resistance. The percentage of acrosome-reacting sperm that bound to the ZP was markedly lower in the presence of 20 μM ellagic acid than in the untreated and apigenin-treated groups, even though the antioxidant capacity of ellagic acid was weaker than that of apigenin. Furthermore, a markedly higher percentage of embryos developed to the blastocyst stage in the ellagic acid-treated group, and the apoptotic indexes of expanded blastocysts produced by the ellagic acid treatment during IVF were significantly low. Therefore, the anti-hyaluronidase effect of ellagic acid markedly suppressed the induction of the acrosome reaction in sperm that bound to the ZP, resulting in a marked decrease in polyspermy under conditions that maintained high sperm penetrability during IVF and sustainment of the developmental potency in porcine oocytes.",

      "abstract": "Cancer is a complex and multifaceted disease with a high global incidence and mortality rate. Although cancer therapy has evolved significantly over the years, numerous challenges persist on the path to effectively combating this multifaceted disease. Natural compounds derived from plants, fungi, or marine organisms have garnered considerable attention as potential therapeutic agents in the field of cancer research. Ellagic acid (EA), a natural polyphenolic compound found in various fruits and nuts, has emerged as a potential cancer prevention and treatment agent. This review summarizes the experimental evidence supporting the role of EA in targeting key hallmarks of cancer, including proliferation, angiogenesis, apoptosis evasion, immune evasion, inflammation, genomic instability, and more. We discuss the molecular mechanisms by which EA modulates signaling pathways and molecular targets involved in these cancer hallmarks, based on in vitro and in vivo studies. The multifaceted actions of EA make it a promising candidate for cancer prevention and therapy. Understanding its impact on cancer biology can pave the way for developing novel strategies to combat this complex disease.",

Since novel treatment options with safe and antibiotics-independent compounds would be highly appreciable, we here investigated the anti-bacterial and disease-alleviating effects of carvacrol, butyrate, ellagic acid, and 2'-fucosyl-lactose in acute murine campylobacteriosis. To address this, secondary abiotic IL-10-/- mice were perorally infected with C. jejuni and treated with either compound alone or all four in combination via the drinking water starting two days post-infection. RESULTS: On day 6, the duodenal pathogen loads were lower in mice of the combination versus the vehicle treatment cohort. Importantly, mice treated with carvacrol and the combination presented with less distinct diarrheal symptoms, colonic histopathology, epithelial cell apoptosis, and immune cell responses when compared to vehicle counterparts on day 6 post-infection. Furthermore, the combination treatment did not only diminish colonic IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-6 secretion in C. jejuni infected mice, but also dampened extra-intestinal and even systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations to basal levels as measured in liver, kidneys, lungs, and serum samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our preclinical placebo-controlled intervention trial provides evidence that the combined oral application of carvacrol, butyrate, ellagic acid, and 2'-fucosyl-lactose alleviates acute campylobacteriosis in the vertebrate host."

      "abstract": "The limited water solubility and bioactivity of lipophilic phytochemicals may be enhanced by delivery systems. Ellagic acid (EA) has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, but low solubility and instability limit its use in the food industry. In this study, the pH-shift method was applied to encapsulate EA with soy protein isolate (SPI). The interaction, encapsulation, and protective potential of the EA-loaded soy SPI complexes (SPI-EA) were investigated. The fluorescence spectra results suggest that the reaction between SPI and EA is spontaneous, with hydrophobic interactions predominating. Binding of EA molecules quenches the intrinsic fluorescence of SPI, mainly static quenching, with a binding site involved in the binding process. The ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectroscopy of the SPI-EA complexes included the characteristic absorption peaks of both SPI and EA, and the scanning electron microscopy images further indicated that the EA had been successfully embedded in SPI. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy illustrates that EA has significantly changed the secondary structure of the SPI, primarily in the form of a decreased content of α-helix structures and an increased content of β-sheet and random coil structures. The encapsulation efficiency of EA was concentration-dependent, up to 81.08%. The addition of EA reduces the size of SPI particles (d < 155 nm). In addition, the SPI-EA complex showed up to 81.05% and 96.46% 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical scavenging activity. TGA showed that the degradation temperature of SPI-EA complex could be extended up to 300°C. And by encapsulation of EA, the loss of EA under the action of UV light, heat treatment, and high concentration of salt ion sensitive environment can be reduced. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Ellagic acid (EA), a natural bioactive with low water solubility and stability, can be enhanced by forming an inclusion complex with soy protein isolate (SPI). SPI-EA complex has broad potential applications in the food, beverage, and pharmaceutical industries. Multiple spectral analyses have contributed to our understanding of the formation and interaction mechanisms of the SPI-EA complex under pH-driven conditions. Stability assays have also aided in the development of dietary resources for EA.",

      "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects millions of people worldwide and is considered a significant risk factor for colorectal cancer. Recent in vivo and in vitro studies reported that ellagic acid (EA) exhibits important antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we investigated the preventive effects of EA against dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced acute colitis, liver, and brain injury in mice through the gut-liver-brain axis. Acute colitis, liver, and brain injury were induced by treatment with 5% (w/v) DSS in the drinking water for 7 days. Freshly prepared EA (60 mg/kg/day) was orally administered, while control (CON) group mice were treated similarly by daily oral administrations with a vehicle (water). All the mice were euthanized 24 h after the final treatment with EA. The blood, liver, colon, and brain samples were collected for further histological and biochemical analyses. Co-treatment with a physiologically relevant dose (60 mg/kg/day) of EA for 7 days significantly reduced the DSS-induced gut barrier dysfunction; endotoxemia; and inflammatory gut, liver, and brain injury in mice by modulating gut microbiota composition and inhibiting the elevated oxidative and nitrative stress marker proteins. Our results further demonstrated that the preventive effect of EA on the DSS-induced IBD mouse model was mediated by blocking the NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Therefore, EA co-treatment significantly attenuated the pro-inflammatory and oxidative stress markers by suppressing the activation of NF-κB/MAPK pathways in gut, liver, and brain injury. These results suggest that EA, effective in attenuating IBD in a mouse model, deserves further consideration as a potential therapeutic for the treatment of inflammatory diseases."

In this context, medicinal plants have become relevant tools regarding their potential role in the prevention and treatment of OA, being safe and effective. The aim of this work was investigate the therapeutic efficacy of the ethyl acetate fraction of Bixa orellana leaves (BoEA) and ellagic acid (ElAc) for the therapeutic treatment of OA induced by monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) in rats. The plant material was extracted via maceration with 70 % hydroalcoholic solvent (BoHE). The ethyl acetate (BoEA) fraction was by solvents in increasing order of polarity. The ElAc was identified and isolated in BoEA using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-DAD) and analytical curve. The OA was induced using MIA in the right knee at the knee joint. Doses of BoEA and ElAc were administered daily (every 24 h, orally) at concentrations of 50, 100 and 50 mg/kg, respectively, for 28 days after induced OA. We evaluated the animals through clinical and radiological examinations every 7 days and, on the 29th day, the animals were euthanized, the joints being removed for histopathological analysis and the serum for cytokine analysis. BoEA and ElAc compounds reduced inflammation and nociception in OA and were as effective as indomethacin in clinical parameters of joint discomfort and allodynia in rats, in addition to showing improvements in radiological and histopathological images, acting on the progress of cartilage deterioration, proving properties related to anti-inflammatory and analgesic processes, being important allies for new therapeutic interventions for the treatment of OA.",

      "abstract": "The resistance to therapy and relapse in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is highly attributed to hepatic cancer stem cells (HCSCs). HCSCs are under microenvironment control. This work aimed to assess the systemic effect of ellagic acid (EA) on the HCC microenvironment to decline HCSCs. Fifty Wistar rats were divided into six groups: negative control (CON), groups 2 and 3 for solvents (DMSO), and (OVO). Group 4 was administered EA only. The (HCC-M) group, utilized as an HCC model, administered CCL4 (0.5 mL/kg in OVO) 1:1 v/v, i.p) for 16 weeks. HCC-M rats were treated orally with EA (EA + HCC) 50 mg/kg bw for five weeks. Biochemical, morphological, histopathological, and immunohistochemical studies, and gene analysis using qRT-PCR were applied. Results revealed elevated liver injury biomarkers ALT, AST, ALP, and tumor biomarkers AFP and GGT, and marked nodularity of livers of HCC-M. EA effectively reduced the biomarkers and restored the altered structure of the livers. At the mRNA level, EA downregulated the expression of TGF-α, TGF-β, and VEGF, and restored p53 expression. This induced an increase in apoptotic cells immunostained with caspase3 and decreased the CD44 immunostained HCSCs. EA could modulate the tumor microenvironment in the HCC rat model and ultimately target the HCSCs."

In this study, the effects of ellagic acid on key regulators of lipid metabolism, and histopathological alterations in aged liver were examined. METHODS: A total of 21 male Wistar rats were divided into three groups, including young control, old control, and old ellagic acid. After one month of treatment with ellagic acid, the expression levels of hepatic SIRT1, AMPK, SREBP-1c, PPAR-α, and phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK) were evaluated. The levels of several serum biochemical factors, and hepatic triglyceride, and cholesterol contents were assessed. RESULTS: Ellagic acid elevated the levels of SIRT1, p-AMPK, and PPAR-α and reduced SREBP-1c level in the liver of old rats. It decreased triglyceride and cholesterol contents in the aged liver and improved histopathological changes. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that ellagic acid can exert protective effects against hepatic lipid metabolism disorders induced by ageing.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Depression is one of the most common psychological disorders among multiple sclerosis (MS) patients that characterized as the first symptoms. Ellagic acid is a natural polyphenol that may have neuroprotective properties through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of Ellagic acid on circulating levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), interferon-γ (IFN-ƴ), nitric oxide (NO), nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), cortisol, serotonergic system, and indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO) gene expression in MS patients with mild to moderate depressive symptoms. STUDY DESIGN: A randomized triple-blind clinical trial. METHODS: The eligible patients according to the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into two groups: either 180 mg Ellagic acid (Axenic company) (n = 25) or 180 mg maltodextrin (n = 25) group for 12 weeks. The Ellagic acid supplement were identical to placebo in shape, color and odor. Serum BDNF, NO, Nrf2, cortisol, serotonin, and IFN-ƴ were measured by ELISA kit in the baseline and end of the study. Also, demographic characteristics, anthropometric measurements, physical activity, food intake, Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and expanding disability status scale (EDSS) questionnaires, as well as IDO gene expression were assessed. SPSS software version 24 was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Fifty patients were evaluated, and a significant decrease in BDI-II (p = 0.001), IFN-ƴ (p = 0.001), NO (p = 0.004), cortisol (p = 0.015), IDO gene expression (p = 0.001) and as well as increased the level of BDNF (p = 0.006) and serotonin (p = 0.019) was observed among those who received 90 mg Ellagic acid twice a day for 12 weeks versus control group. However, there were no significant differences between groups for Nrf2 levels (p>0.05) at the end of study. CONCLUSION: The current study indicates that Ellagic acid intervention has a favorable effect on depression in MS patients. This is achieved by reducing BDI-II scores, as well as levels of NO, cortisol, IFN-ƴ, and IDO gene expression. Furthermore, we found a significant elevation in circulating levels of BDNF and serotonin.",

It was observed that EA administration significantly alleviated the colonic inflammation phenotypes, including decreasing the disease activity index (DAI), enhancing the body weight loss, and improving the shortened length of the colon and pathological damage of colon tissue. Additionally, EA reshaped the constitution of the gut microbiota by elevating the ratio of Bacteroidetes along with Bacteroides and Muribaculaceae, while decreasing the proportion of Firmicutes. The Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States 2 (PICRUSt2) revealed that the metabolic function of the gut microbiota was also changed. Furthermore, mouse colon transcriptome analysis showed that the tight junction and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathways were activated and the expressions of related genes were upregulated after EA intervention. These results showed that EA could remodel the gut bacterial composition, change the intestinal epithelial cell gene expressions in mice, and consequently improve the colonic inflammatory symptoms.",

IM has severe clinical effects such as diarrhea, erythematous mucosal lesions, and the development of ulcers accompanied by excruciating pain. This study aimed to evaluate the mucoprotective effects of ellagic acid on 5-FU-induced IM in mice. Mice were administered normal saline intraperitoneally for six days, followed by intraperitoneal injection of 5-FU for four days at a dose of 50 mg per kilogram. Ellagic acid was orally administered to the mice in groups III and IV in two doses (5 mg and 10 mg), with a one-hour time separation from 5-FU for ten days. At the end of the experiment, small intestine tissue was collected to measure the levels of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-B, TNF) using ELISA assay. Pre-treatment with ellagic acid led to a significant decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines and improved antioxidant enzyme levels compared to the 5-FU group. Histopathological analysis demonstrated the mucoprotective effect of ellagic acid against 5-FU-induced intestinal changes, including villi atrophy, damage to stem cells, infiltration of inflammatory cells in the mucosal layer, edema, damage to muscular mucosa, and decreased oxidative stress production, such as MDA. These results suggest that ellagic acid may be a potential candidate for treating IM induced by antineoplastic drugs.",

The lesions improved after treatment with topical steroids and allergen avoidance within 1-2 weeks. Subsequent patch testing with the plants, nectar and synthetic ingredients identified ellagic acid (EA) as the sensitizing agent. This is the first proven case of allergic contact dermatitis to EA, a phenolic substance present in numerous plants, fruits, and nuts regularly consumed by humans. Melianthus use is growing worldwide as an ornamental plant. Moreover, it is used in traditional South African medicine for its anti-inflammatory effects. In recent years, these extracts and EA have been added to natural, plant-based topical formulations for the treatment of inflammatory skin disorders. Our observation that the EA found in Melianthus can induce severe contact allergy should caution for the possible dangers of specific allergic sensitizations to these increasingly used additives in natural medicines.",

Twenty-four SD rats were randomly distributed into three treatment groups: (1) control group, (2) UC group, and (3) UC + EA group. Samples were collected for analysis after a 15-day trial period. We found that EA mitigated the colitis symptoms in TNBS-treated rats. Besides, EA decreased the expression of cytokines by inhibiting NF-κB signalling. TNBS-induced reduction in tight junction proteins was restored by EA supplementation via regulating RhoA/ROCK/MLC signalling. Further, persistent colonic inflammation destroyed the activity of goblet cells by inhibiting the expression of KLF4 and TFF3. EA also enhanced the expression of MUC2, AGR2, ST6GAL1 and B3GNT6. In summary, our findings demonstrated that dietary supplementation with EA ameliorated TNBS-induced colitis by maintaining intestinal barrier function, which proves its potential role as a therapeutic agent in the attenuation of UC.",

It has anti-tumor, anti-oxidation, anti-inflammatory, anti-mutation, anti-bacterial, anti-allergic and multiple pharmacological properties. Studies have shown its anti-tumor effect in gastric cancer, liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer and other malignant tumors, mainly through inducing tumor cell apoptosis, inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, inhibiting tumor cell metastasis and invasion, inducing autophagy, affecting tumor metabolic reprogramming and other forms of anti-tumor efficacy. Its molecular mechanism is mainly reflected in inhibiting the proliferation of tumor cells through VEGFR-2 signaling pathway, Notch signaling pathway, PKC signaling pathway and COX-2 signaling pathway. PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, JNK (cJun) signaling pathway, mitochondrial pathway, Bcl-2 / Bax signaling pathway, TGF-β/Smad3 signaling pathway induced apoptosis of tumor cells and blocked EMT process and MMP SDF1α/CXCR4 signaling pathway inhibits the metastasis and invasion of tumor cells, induces autophagy and affects tumor metabolic reprogramming to produce anti-tumor effects. At present, the analysis of the anti-tumor mechanism of ellagic acid is slightly lacking, so this study comprehensively searched the literature on the anti-tumor mechanism of ellagic acid in various databases, reviewed the research progress of the anti-tumor effect and mechanism of ellagic acid, in order to provide reference and theoretical basis for the further development and application of ellagic acid.",

Furthermore, A. baumannii has adopted great ability to nullify the majority of currently available antibiotics. With the purpose of finding a nontoxic and efficient therapeutic agent, we analyzed the activity of Ellagic acid (EA) against the multidrug-resistant A. baumannii. EA not only demonstrated its activity against A. baumannii, but also inhibited the biofilm formation. Since EA shows poor solubility in an aqueous environment, a lipid nanoparticle-based (liposomal) formulation of EA (EA-liposomes) was prepared and its effectiveness was assessed to treat bacterial infection in the immunocompromised murine model. Therapy with EA-liposomes imparted greater protection to infected mice by increasing the survival and decreasing the bacterial load in the lungs. A. baumannii infected mice treated with EA-liposomes (100 mg/kg) showed 60% survival rate as compared to 20% of those treated with free EA at the same dose. The bacterial load was found to be 32778 ± 12232 in the lungs of EA-liposomes (100 mg/kg)-treated mice, which was significantly lower to 165667 ± 53048 in the lung tissues of free EA treated mice. Likewise, EA-liposomes also restored the liver function (AST and ALT) and kidney function parameters (BUN and creatinine). The broncho-alveolar fluid (BALF) from infected mice contained greater quantities of IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α, which were significantly alleviated in EA-liposomes treated mice. These findings together support the possible implication of EA-liposomes to treat A. baumannii infection, especially in immunocompromised mice."

Ellagic acid (EA) is a natural polyphenol that prevents fibroblasts from proliferating and migrating. This study aimed to determine the role of EA in HS formation and its possible mechanism by in vitro experiments. HS fibroblasts (HSFs) and normal fibroblasts (NFs) were separated from HS tissue and normal skin tissue, respectively. HSFs were treated with 10 and 50 μM EA to assess their effect on HS formation. In particular, 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and scratch assay were used to detect the viability and migration ability of HSFs. Quantitative reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure the mRNA expression level of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), extracellular matrix (ECM)-related gene collagen-I (COL-I), and fibronectin 1 (FN1) in HSFs. Finally, Western blot was utilized to measure the expression level of TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway-related proteins in HSFs. The viability of HSFs was significantly increased compared with NFs. 10 and 50 μM EA treatment markedly inhibition the cell viability and migration of HSFs. EA treatment upregulated the bFGF expression level and downregulated the COL-I and FN1 expression level in HSFs. In addition, p-Smad2, p-Smad3, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 expression levels as well as p-Smad2/Smad2 and p-Smad3/Smad3 ratios remarkably decreased in HSFs after EA treatment. EA inhibited the formation of HSs by suppressing the viability and migration of HSFs and ECM deposition as well as by preventing the activation of TGF-β/Smad signaling.",

      "abstract": "Ellagic acid, the marker component of peels of Punica granatum L., is known traditionally to treat traumatic hemorrhage. In this study, the cellular mechanism underlying ellagic acid-induced anti-inflammation was investigated using lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) as a neuroinflammation inducer. Our in vitro data showed that LPS (1 μg/mL) consistently phosphorylated ERK and induced neuroinflammation, such as elevation in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and nitric oxide production in treated BV-2 cells. Incubation of ellagic acid significantly inhibited LPS-induced ERK phosphorylation and subsequent neuroinflammation in treated BV-2 cells. Furthermore, our in vivo study of neuroinflammation employed an intranigral infusion of LPS that resulted in a time-dependent elevation in phosphorylated ERK levels in the infused substantia nigra (SN). Oral administration of ellagic acid (100 mg/kg) significantly attenuated LPS-induced ERK phosphorylation. A four-day treatment of ellagic acid did not alter LPS-induced ED-1 elevation but ameliorated LPS-induced reduction in CD206 and arginase-1 (two biomarkers of M2 microglia). A seven-day treatment of ellagic acid abolished LPS-induced increases in heme-oxygenase-1, cyclo-oxygenase 2, and α-synuclein trimer levels (a pathological hallmark) in the infused SN. At the same time, ellagic acid attenuated LPS-induced increases in active caspase 3 and receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 levels (respective biomarkers of apoptosis and necroptosis) as well as reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells in the infused SN. In silico analysis showed that ellagic acid binds to the catalytic site of MEK1. Our data suggest that ellagic acid is capable of inhibiting MEK1-ERK signaling and then attenuated LPS-induced neuroinflammation, protein aggregation, and programmed cell deaths. Moreover, M2 microglial polarization is suggested as a novel antineuroinflammatory mechanism in the ellagic acid-induced neuroprotection.",

      "abstract": "The use of adjuvant therapy is an attractive approach to manage sickle cell disease (SCD) symptomatically. The present study aimed to investigate the potential of ellagic acid as an adjuvant therapy with hydroxyurea (HU), a key drug for SCD with myelosuppressive toxic effects. A panel of experiments was performed using SCD patient's blood (ex vivo) and transgenic mice model of SCD (in vivo). Ellagic acid exhibited the following beneficial pharmacological actions: (a) potent anti-sickling, polymerization inhibitory, and inherent non-hemolytic activity; (b) pronounced action to abrogate HU-induced neutropenia and to improve key hematological parameters during SCD (RBC, Hb, platelet levels); (c) considerable action to foster vascular tone (L-proline); (d) marked attenuating effect against oxidative stress (nitrotyrosine, hypoxanthine, MDA, GSH); (e) substantial inhibitory role against inflammation (analgesic activity and regulation of hemin, TNF-α, IL-1β, NF-κB/IκBα); (f) remarkable outcome of declining vaso-occlusive crisis (P-selectin, ERK1/2); (g) notable shielding deed against elevated biochemical marker for organ toxicity (creatinine); (h) noticeably prevented histopathological alterations of the spleen. Additionally, the pharmacokinetic study results of HU in the presence and absence of ellagic acid using a mouse model demonstrate that ellagic acid could be safely co-administered with HU. Overall findings suggest that ellagic acid is a promising candidate for adjuvant therapy in SCD based on its own significant ability against SCD and potentiating capability of HU action via targeting improvement at the various stages of pathophysiological complications during SCD and minimizing HU-induced toxicological manifestations."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cholestasis is a health problem, both in humans and animals, which in the disease's course involves oxidative stress, inflammation, and liver fibrosis. EA has been proven to have beneficial effects on various diseases. AIM: This study was conducted to determine the effect of EA in protecting liver damage because of cholestasis. In addition, to understand the underlying mechanism of liver damage in rats as a model animal by bile duct ligation (BDL) technique. METHODS: In this study, male adult rats were used and randomly divided into three treatment groups. S is the sham-operated group, BDL is the group that is treated with BDL and the BDL-EA group is treated with BDL and given EA by gavage at a dose of 60 mg/kg bw/day, starting on the second day after BDL and given for 21 days. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) were evaluated using spectrophotometer; tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β1) were evaluated using sandwich ELISA and histopathological examination using HE and Massion's Trichrome staining. RESULTS: In this study, BDL significantly increased serum levels of AST, ALT, ALP, and hepatic GGT. In addition, BDL also increased levels of TNF-α, and TGF-β1 compared to sham-operated controls. Histological studies in the BDL group also showed that the BDL increased the degree of necro-inflammation and collagen deposition area in the liver compared to the sham-operated group. Administration of EA has been shown to significantly improve liver morpho-function of the liver. I attenuated these changes in the BDL-EA group, where all observed study variables appeared to have improved. CONCLUSION: EA has been shown to reduce cholestasis that causes liver injury and improves liver enzyme profiles, and is suspected to have occurred because of its activities as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic.",

      "abstract": "Oxidants play a crucial role in the development of oxidative stress, which is linked to disease progression. Ellagic acid is an effective antioxidant with applications in the treatment and prevention of several diseases, since it neutralizes free radicals and reduces oxidative stress. However, it has limited application due to its poor solubility and oral bioavailability. Since ellagic acid is hydrophobic, it is difficult to load it directly into hydrogels for controlled release applications. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to first prepare inclusion complexes of ellagic acid (EA) with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and then load them into carbopol-934-grafted-2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propane sulfonic acid (CP-g-AMPS) hydrogels for orally controlled drug delivery. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to validate ellagic acid inclusion complexes and hydrogels. There was slightly higher swelling and drug release at pH 1.2 (42.20% and 92.13%) than at pH 7.4 (31.61% and 77.28%), respectively. Hydrogels had high porosity (88.90%) and biodegradation (9.2% per week in phosphate-buffered saline). Hydrogels were tested for their antioxidant properties in vitro against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS). Additionally, the antibacterial activity of hydrogels was demonstrated against Gram-positive bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) and Gram-negative bacterial strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa)."

      "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the serious complications of diabetes, which has become the fourth leading cause of vision loss worldwide. Current treatment of DR relies on intravitreal injections of antiangiogenic agents, which has made considerable achievements in reducing visual impairment. However, long-term invasive injections require advanced technology and can lead to poor patient compliance as well as the incidence of ocular complications including bleeding, endophthalmitis, retinal detachment and others. Hence, we developed non-invasive liposomes (EA-Hb/TAT&isoDGR-Lipo) for efficiency co-delivery of ellagic acid and oxygen, which can be administered intravenously or by eye drops. Among that, ellagic acid (EA), as an aldose reductase inhibitor, could remove excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by high glucose for preventing retinal cell apoptosis, as well as reduce retinal angiogenesis through the blockage of VEGFR2 signaling pathway; carried oxygen could ameliorate DR hypoxia, and further enhanced the anti-neovascularization efficacy. Our results showed that EA-Hb/TAT&isoDGR-Lipo not only effectively protected retinal cells from high glucose-induced damage, but also inhibited VEGF-induced vascular endothelial cells migration, invasion, and tube formation in vitro. In addition, in a hypoxic cell model, EA-Hb/TAT&isoDGR-Lipo could reverse retinal cell hypoxia, thereby reducing the expression of VEGF. Significantly, after being administered as an injection or eye drops, EA-Hb/TAT&isoDGR-Lipo obviously ameliorated the structure (central retinal thickness and retinal vascular network) of retina by eliminating ROS and down-regulating the expression of GFAP, HIF-1α, VEGF and p-VEGFR2 in a DR mouse model. In summary, EA-Hb/TAT&isoDGR-Lipo holds great potentials in improvement of DR, which provides a novel approach for the treatment of DR.",

They were randomly divided into three groups: Model group, EA 50 mg/kg, and EA 100 mg/kg group. The wound area of rats at 0-7 days was measured and the wound healing rate was calculated. The levels of inflammatory factors tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon γ (IFN-γ), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and immunoglobulins IgA, IgG, and IgM in rat serum were evaluated by ELISA. Flow cytometry was used to detect the CD4 +/CD8 + T cell ratio, levels of Foxp3 + Treg cells, and CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cells (Treg) cells levels in the peripheral blood of rats. On the fourth to seventh day of the burn, EA treatment could significantly promote the decrease of the wound area and the increase of the wound healing rate in burned rats. Further examination revealed that the levels of inflammatory factors in serum were remarkedly decreased and immunoglobulins levels were increased in the EA group, compared with the Model group. Meanwhile, the levels of CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells and Foxp3+ Treg cells were significantly decreased, whereas the CD4+/CD8 + T cell ratio was observably increased in a concentration-dependent manner. Altogether, EA effectively promotes the wound healing of burned rats by regulating the levels of inflammatory factors, immunoglobulin, and T cells in burned rats, and improves the symptoms of burn immunosuppression.",

With the increase in cesarean sections and endometrial surgical procedures, intrauterine adhesions have become a problem with increasing incidence and decreasing implantation. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of ellagic acid (EA), a phenolic compound, on fibrosis in IUA model rats. Another goal of the study was to increase endometrial receptivity with EA. The groups in the study were planned as control, DMSO, EA, IUA, IUA+DMSO, and IUA+EA, with 8 Sprague Dawley rats in each group. EA was administered at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day for 35 days. At the end of the experiment, the uterine tissues of the rats were removed. Histochemical staining was used to validate the IUA model and determine the degree of fibrosis. The levels of some fibrosis-related genes and proteins in the obtained uterine tissues were evaluated. In addition, implantation rates were determined. In our findings, it was observed that the fibrotic structure was decreased in the treated IUA+EA group compared to the IUA group, while fibrotic improvement was supported by down-regulation of TGFβ1 activity and up-regulation of BMP7 activity. The increase in the expression of the endometrial marker LIF with EA treatment was consistent with the increase in implantation rates with treatment. As a result of the study, it can be said that EA applied as a treatment against IUA causes healing in uterine tissue by reducing fibrosis and increases implantation rates by increasing endometrial receptivity.",

However, there is ongoing debate about the difference in XO inhibitory activity between EA and allopurinol. Additionally, the inhibitory kinetics and mechanism of EA on XO are still unclear. Herein, the authors systematically studied the inhibitory effects of EA on XO. The authors' findings showed that EA is a reversible inhibitor with mixed-type inhibition, and its inhibitory activity is weaker than allopurinol. Fluorescence quenching experiments suggested that the generation of EA-XO complex was exothermic and spontaneous. In silico analysis further confirmed that EA entered the XO catalytic centre. Furthermore, the authors verified the anti-hyperuricemia effect of EA in vivo. This study elucidates the inhibition kinetics and mechanism of EA on XO, and lays a theoretical foundation for the further development of drugs and functional foods containing EA for the treatment of hyperuricemia.",

      "abstract": "Ellagic acid (EA) exhibits potential antiaging activity. Differences in individual ability to produce urolithins may result in large interindividual variability in the health effects of EA. Therefore, the effects and mechanism of EA on d-galactose-induced aging, considering urolithin A-producing ability, were investigated. Our results showed that EA improved cognitive impairment and hippocampal damage, increased the GABA (by 107.84-117.86%) and 5-HT (by 72.56-100.85%) levels, and suppressed the inflammatory and oxidative stress in aging rats. Thirteen plasma metabolites and 12 brain metabolites were improved by EA administration in aging rats. In particular, EA showed a better anti-aging effect in high-UroA-producing rats than in the low counterparts, while antibiotic intervention almost offset EA-alleviated aging induced by d-gal. Furthermore, the lower ratio of Firmicutes and Bacteroidota as well as the greater abundances of Akkermansia (by 139.21%), Bifidobacterium (by 88.04%), Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 (by 183.47%), Lactobacillus (by 97.23%), and Turicibacter (by 83.06%) were observed in the high-UroA-producing group compared with the model group (p < 0.05). These findings provide novel insights into the anti-aging effects of EA and suggest that the ability of the gut microbiota responding to EA largely determines EA's anti-aging performance.",

NPDA and NPDC have different genetic origins, being caused by mutations in the acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) or the cholesterol transport protein NPC1, respectively. However, they share a common pathological hallmark in the accumulation of lipids in the endolysosomal compartment. Here, we tested the hypothesis that polyphenols reduce lipid overload in NPD cells by enhancing the secretion of extracellular vesicles (ECVs). We show that among the polyphenols tested, the ellagic acid metabolites, urolithin A and B, were the safest and most efficient in increasing ECV secretion. They reduced levels of accumulating lipids and lysosomal size and permeabilization in cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages and neurons from ASMko and NPC1 mutant mice, which mimic NPDA and NPDC, respectively. Moreover, oral treatment with ellagic acid reduced lipid levels, ameliorated lysosomal alterations, and diminished microglia activation in the brain of NPD mice. These results support the therapeutic value of ECV secretion and polyphenols for NPDs, which may also help treat other LSDs characterized by intracellular lipid overload.",

Immunohistochemical staining with Fibrinogen alpha, Laminin β-1 and Collagen IV antibodies and stereological evaluation was performed by Physical Dissector Combination method. Collagen IV was used in control, diabetes and treatment groups showed similar immunostaining. Fibrinogen alpha was observed to be increased in the vessel wall in the diabetes group, while the uptake was minimal in the control and treatment groups. While Laminin β-1 was increased in the diabetes group compared to the control group, immunostaining was observed in the treatment groups similar to the control group. It was observed that the total nerve area diabetes group decreased significantly compared to the control group, and the treatment groups, except for D+EA group were similar to the control group, but there was no statistically significant difference. The axon numbers in the diabetes group decreased significantly compared to the control group, and the treatment groups were similar to the control group, and there was no statistically significant difference (P > 0.05).

      "abstract": "The inhalation of fine particulate matter (PM) is a significant health-related environmental issue. Previously, we demonstrated that repeated PM exposure causes hyperlocomotive activity in mice, as well as inflammatory and hypoxic responses in their lungs. In this study, we evaluated the potential efficacy of ellagic acid (EA), a natural polyphenolic compound, against PM-induced pulmonary and behavioral abnormalities in mice. Four treatment groups were assigned in this study (n = 8): control (CON), particulate-matter-instilled (PMI), low-dose EA with PMI (EL + PMI), and high-dose EA with PMI (EH + PMI). EA (20 and 100 mg/kg body weight for low dose and high dose, respectively) was orally administered for 14 days in C57BL/6 mice, and after the eighth day, PM (5 mg/kg) was intratracheally instilled for 7 consecutive days. PM exposure induced inflammatory cell infiltration in the lungs following EA pretreatment. Moreover, PM exposure induced inflammatory protein expression in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and the expression of inflammatory (tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnfα), interleukin (Il)-1b, and Il-6) and hypoxic (vascular endothelial growth factor alpha (Vegfα), ankyrin repeat domain 37 (Ankrd37)) response genes. However, EA pretreatment markedly prevented the induction of expression of inflammatory and hypoxic response genes in the lungs. Furthermore, PM exposure significantly triggered hyperactivity by increasing the total moving distance with an increase in moving speed in the open field test. On the contrary, EA pretreatment significantly prevented PM-induced hyperactivity. In conclusion, dietary intervention with EA may be a potential strategy to prevent PM-induced pathology and activity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aging is associated with impaired renal function and structural alterations. Oxidative stress plays a vital role in renal senescence and damage. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is thought to protect cells from oxidative stress through nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2). Ellagic acid (EA), a natural antioxidant, has been demonstrated to have renoprotective roles in vitro and in vivo. This study investigated if SIRT1 and NRF2 mediate the protective effects of EA in aged kidneys. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were divided into three groups including young (4 months), old, and old + EA (25 months). Young and old groups received EA solvent, while the old + EA group was treated with EA (30 mg/kg) by gavage for 30 days. Then, the level of renal oxidative stress, SIRT1 and NRF2 expression, kidney function parameters, and histopathological indices were measured. RESULTS: Treatment with EA significantly increased the level of antioxidant enzymes and reduced malondialdehyde concentration (P < 0.01). Moreover, EA administration remarkably upregulated mRNA and protein levels of SIRT1 and NRF2 as well as deacetylated NRF2 protein (P < 0.05). Additionally, EA treated rats improved kidney function and histopathological scores (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that ellagic acid exerts protective effects on aged kidneys by activating SIRT1 and NRF2 signaling.",

This study investigated ellagic acid-mediated anticancer effects using the human colon cancer HCT-116 cell line. After 72 h of ellagic acid treatment, a total of 206 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) with differential expression greater than 1.5-fold were identified (115 down-regulated and 91 up-regulated). Furthermore, the co-expression network analysis of differentially expressed lncRNA and mRNA showed that differential expressed lncRNA might be the target of ellagic acid activity in inhibiting CRC."

This study aimed to investigate the inhibitory effects of W. coagulans BC2000 and EA on hyperlipidemia-induced cholesterol metabolism disorders. C57BL/6J mice (n = 10 in each group) were fed a low-fat diet, high-fat diet (HFD), HFD supplemented with EA, HFD supplemented with EA and W. coagulans BC77, HFD supplemented with EA, and W. coagulans BC2000. EA and W. coagulans BC2000 supplementation prevented HFD-induced hypercholesterolemia and promoted fecal cholesterol excretion. Transcriptome analysis showed that primary bile acid biosynthesis in the liver was significantly activated by EA and W. coagulans BC2000 treatments. EA and W. coagulans BC2000 treatment also significantly increased the intestinal Eggerthellaceae abundance and the liver EA metabolites, iso-urolithin A, Urolithin A, and Urolithin B. Therefore, W. coagulans BC2000 supplementation promoted the intestinal transformation of EA, which led to the upregulation of liver bile synthesis, thus preventing hypercholesterolemia."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neuropathic pain is a subtype of chronic pain characterized by a primary lesion or dysfunction of the peripheral or central nervous system. The current pain management of neuropathic pain is inadequate and needs new medications. AIM: We studied the effects of 14 days of intraperitoneal ellagic acid (EA) and gabapentin administration in a rat model of neuropathic pain induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the right sciatic nerve. METHODS: Rats were divided into six groups: (1) control, (2) CCI, (3) CCI + EA (50 mg/kg), 4) CCI + EA (100 mg/kg), 5) CCI + gabapentin (100 mg/kg), and 6) CCI + EA (100 mg/kg) + gabapentin (100 mg/kg). Behavioral tests, including mechanical allodynia, cold allodynia, and thermal hyperalgesia, were conducted on days - 1(pre-operation), 7, and 14 post-CCI. In addition, at day 14 post-CCI, spinal cord segments were collected to measure the expression of inflammatory markers, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), nitric oxide (NO), and oxidative stress markers, including malondialdehyde (MDA) and thiol. RESULTS: CCI increased mechanical allodynia, cold allodynia, and thermal hyperalgesia in rats which were reduced by treatment with EA (50 or 100 mg/kg), gabapentin, or their combination. CCI increased TNF-α, NO, and MDA levels and decreased thiol content in the spinal cord, which all were reverted by administration of EA (50 or 100 mg/kg), gabapentin, or their combination. CONCLUSION: This is the first report on ellagic acid's ameliorative effect in rats' CCI-induced neuropathic pain. This effect can be attributed to its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory, thus making it potentially useful as an adjuvant to conventional treatment.",
