      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the effect of corrective exercises and exercises supplemented by kinesiology taping or an orthosis on pain and foot alignment in women with hallux valgus (HV). METHODS: Eighty-two women with HV were randomly divided into groups: E (n = 24) who exercised for 12 weeks; EKT (n = 18) who exercised and used kinesiology taping on HV; EMC (n = 15) who performed exercise and used an orthosis to correct their big toe position; and CHV (25 women with HV without therapy). Additional control group C: (n = 31) women with normal hallux. The Wejsflog index, Clarke's angle, alpha and beta angles, and pain intensity in the big toe area were assessed at the beginning and after therapy. RESULTS: The Wejsflog index was significantly lower in women with HV and increased significantly after therapy in the E and EKT groups. Clarke's angle did not differ between women with and without HV, and Clarke's angle did not change after therapy. The HV angle decreased significantly in groups E and EKT but was still significantly greater than that in group C. The fifth toe varus angle did not differ between women with and without HV and decreased significantly in the right foot after therapy in group E. Pain in the HV area decreased significantly in all groups undergoing therapy. CONCLUSION: Women with HV have a greater forefoot width, but their longitudinal arch and fifth toe position do not differ. Exercises significantly reduce pain and improve hallux alignment. Combining exercises with kinesiology taping or an orthosis does not increase the therapeutic effect. Although the observed effects of conservative therapy are promising, it should be remembered that long-term effects have not been studied.

      "abstract": "Background: Glenohumeral joint instability is associated with a proprioception deficit. Joint position sense can be improved through targeted exercises and kinesiology taping (KT). While previous studies have examined the effects of KT on proprioception, most have focused on the knee joint, with limited research on unstable shoulder joints. Most studies have used commonly available equipment (e.g., the Biodex system). An electronic goniometer, the \"Propriometer\", is a useful tool for assessing proprioception in shoulder joint instability; however, its application in evaluating the effects of KT on shoulder proprioception remains unexplored. This study aimed to (1) assess the usability of the Propriometer for evaluating the effects of KT on unstable shoulders and (2) determine the impact of a single KT application on joint position sense and limb function in individuals with anterior, post-traumatic shoulder joint instability. Methods and Materials: The study included 30 individuals with anterior, unilateral, post-traumatic shoulder joint instability (8 women, 22 men, mean age 26 years). A control group consisted of 35 healthy volunteers (9 women, 26 men, mean age 24 years). Proprioception assessment (active joint position reproduction evaluation) was performed in both groups using the Propriometer, which measures joint position in real time with an accuracy of 0.1° across all axes. The study methodology was validated and used to examine shoulder proprioception. The current study focused on assessing the effects of KT, which had not been previously tested with this device Assessments were conducted before KT application and three days' post-application. Additionally, patients completed the Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI) self-assessment questionnaire before and three days after the therapy. Results: Results of the mean joint position reproduction error indicate a proprioceptive deficit in patients with shoulder joint instability. However, the analyzed KT application did not show a significant change in the magnitude of the active joint position reproduction error. Conversely, KT therapy significantly improved patients' subjective assessment of shoulder function and stability as measured by the WOSI. Conclusions: The Propriometer goniometer and testing methodology are effective tools for assessing the impact of KT on proprioception in shoulder instability. While KT application did not significantly influence shoulder proprioception, it did improve patients' perceived joint stability and function.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-specific neck pain (NSNP) is a significant health issue for individuals in occupations requiring extensive use of electronic devices. Kinesiology taping (KT) and self-cervical sustained natural apohyseal glides (SNAGs) are potential techniques for managing NSNP. However, the existing literature lacks consensus on their effectiveness. The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of KT and self-SNAGs applied to the cervical region of long-duration electronic device (LDED) users. METHODS: The study was a single-blinded, two-arm, and parallel randomized controlled trial approach. LDED users who had symptoms of pain in the cervical region were randomly allocated to either the KT (n = 15) or self-SNAGs (n = 15) group. Outcomes included upper trapezius (UT) muscle activity, Visual Analog Scale (VAS), joint position sense error (JPSE), and respiratory muscle strength. Participants were evaluated at baseline, 4 weeks post-intervention and at a 1-month follow-up. RESULTS: There was statistical significance in UT muscle activity, VAS, and JPSE after the 4 weeks period of treatment within the groups. There was statistical significance in respiratory muscle strength only in the group that received self-SNAGs (p = 0.032). There was no statistical difference between the two groups after treatment in all outcomes apart from JPSE during extension (p = 0.028). Group by time interactions showed no statistical significance across the three timelines between groups. DISCUSSION: KT and self-SNAGs have desirable effects on pain intensity, proprioceptive sense, and upper trapezius muscle activity among LDED users with symptoms of NSNP. However, self-SNAGs were more effective in improving respiratory muscle strength than KT.",

OBJECTIVE: This study compared the effects of percussion massage therapy (PMT), kinesiology tape (KT), and dynamic stretching (DS) on shoulder strength, proprioception, and functionality. METHODS: The KT group had kinesiology tape applied to the deltoid muscles. The DS group performed dynamic stretching in flexion and abduction. The PMT group received percussion massage on the deltoid muscles. Assessments included the Becure system for joint position sense (JPS), the Timed Functional Arm and Shoulder Test (TFAST), and a hand-held dynamometer for muscle strength. RESULTS: Significant improvements were observed in almost all JPS parameters for all groups (p < 0.05). Total TFAST scores improved in all groups. Muscle strength significantly improved in the DS group (p < 0.05), while PMT and KT groups showed no significant change (p > 0.05). Statistically significant differences were found between the groups (p < 0.05). JPS 30°, 60°, and 90° flexion parameters had effect sizes of 0.51, 0.64, and 0.49, respectively; JPS 30°, 60°, and 90° abduction parameters had effect sizes of 0.38, 0.46, and 0.45, respectively. The effect size for Total TFAST was 0.55, flexion muscle strength 0.59, and abduction muscle strength 0.68. DS was more effective for muscle strength, DS and PMT for functionality, and KT and PMT for proprioception (p < 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: PMT and KT were more effective for proprioception, PMT and DS were more effective for functionality, and DS was most efficient in enhancing muscle strength."

Conservative treatment for knee osteoarthritis includes exercise therapy, physical therapy, and taping therapy. Kinesiology taping has gained traction in clinical practice for knee osteoarthritis treatment owing to its therapeutic benefits.

This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of physical therapy combined with kinesiology taping on pain and quadriceps muscle weakness in patients with knee osteoarthritis and compare it with that of placebo treatment. [Participants and Methods] The study included 31 patients diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis. We examined and compared the effects of taping between the kinesiology taping group and the placebo group with respect to knee extension muscle strength, pain, range of motion, walking speed, and quality of life after 4 weeks of physical therapy. [Results] Significant main effects of time were observed for all parameters, except the contralateral range of motion. However, significant main effects of group factors were not observed for any parameter. [Conclusion] The combination of physical therapy and kinesiology taping did not show significantly greater effectiveness than placebo treatment in alleviating pain and quadriceps weakness in patients with knee osteoarthritis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of lost productivity, absenteeism, disability, and early retirement worldwide. LBP treatment should be comprehensive, including prevention, education, diagnosis, and various treatment methods. Management can be divided into pharmacological and non-pharmacological. The role of physiotherapy in the comprehensive treatment of LBP is very important. Elastic therapeutic tape, also called kinesiology tape or therapeutic kinesiology tape, has been used for about 50 years. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Kinesio taping in patients suffering from (LBP), and its possible effect on the swing of the center of pressure (COP), balance, gait, improvement of coordination, and pain reduction. METHODS: A total of 60 patients aged 20 to 83 years (54% women) were examined, all of whom fulfilled the requirements for admission and rejection. The L1-L5 spine of the experimental group underwent Kinesio taping in addition to thorough rehabilitation. The control group underwent balance control training based on visual feedback (VFB). The research tools used included the Bohannon single-leg standing test, the FAC (Functional Ambulatory Category) scale, the Podsiadlo and Richardson Standing and Walking Test called \"Timed Up and Go\" (TUG), evaluation of lumbar spine movement, Lasegue's test and examination of neurological deficit symptoms, and self-assessment of pain using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). RESULTS: The effects of Kinesio taping on pain, gait, coordination, postural control, and balance are statistically significant. The main parameter influencing the effects of Kinesio taping was age (below 55 years); this relationship was also observed in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Kinesio taping is an effective method in the treatment of LBP. It improves postural control, balance, gait, coordination, and pain."

As such, this study sought to investigate the effects of kinesiology taping (KT) and low-Dye taping treatments, used in conjunction with extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT), on pain and function in patients with PF. METHODS: To conduct this randomized controlled study, 45 individuals with PF aged 18 to 65 years were included, with 15 individuals assigned to each group: the KT, low-Dye, and control groups. Pain intensity was evaluated using the visual analog scale, and functionality was assessed using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scale before and after the study. Each group received three sessions of ESWT. RESULTS: When pretreatment and post-treatment differences were analyzed, first-step pain in the morning, pain with palpation, and pain after prolonged standing were reduced in the KT, low-Dye, and control groups (P < .05 for all). There were differences in the AOFAS total score in the KT (P <.001; r = 2.03), low-Dye (P < .001; r = 1.49), and control (P = .003; r = 0.92) groups. Low-Dye taping was more effective than the control in reducing pain with standing and improving AOFAS function scores (P < .05). Low-Dye taping and KT were effective in improving AOFAS total scores (P < .05) but were not superior to each other (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Based on these findings, taping techniques such as KT and low-Dye, combined with conventional treatments such as ESWT, may be beneficial for improving pain and function in individuals with PF. Further randomized controlled trials with longer follow-up are needed to confirm this hypothesis.",

The study population consisted of 16 young controls (YC group) and 15 patients with hallux valgus (HV group). All subjects underwent a natural velocity gait assessment. Additionally, 11 patients from the HV group received KT intervention over a period of one month, consisting of 15 sessions administered every other day. After the one-month intervention, these patients underwent a gait assessment and were included in the HV-KT group. The electromyography (EMG) and joint motion were evaluated using non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) to compare the difference in muscle and kinematic synergy among the three groups. The center of plantar pressure (COP) and ground reaction force (GRF) were measured by the force platform. The number of synergies did not differ within the three groups, but the structure of muscle synergies and kinematic synergies differed in the HV group. The KT intervention (HV-KT group) altered the structure of synergies. The correlation between kinematic synergies and muscular synergies was lower in the HV group than in the YC group, whereas the correlation between the two increased after the KT intervention in the HV group. During gait, the HV group tended to activate more muscles around foot joints to maintain body stability. The visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, hallux valgus angle (HVA), and COP were significantly decreased after the intervention ( [Formula: see text]). HV patients exhibited altered kinematic and muscular synergies structures as well as muscle activation. Also, it weakened the balance and athletic ability of HV patients. KT intervention improved neuromuscular control to provide a better gait performance.",

KT has been found to have effects on facilitating muscle strength by generating a concentric pull on the fascia. However, little is known about KT in the improvement of dynamic and static balance. This study aims to explore whether KT on the quadriceps muscle has any immediate effects on static and dynamic balance. METHODOLOGY: Twenty-seven healthy individuals (13 males and 14 females, aged 22 to 29) were recruited in a crossover study with two conditions: KT and no taping. KT was applied to the quadriceps muscle for the taping group, with the control receiving no taping. Pre- and post-test measurements were taken to give an indication of the effect of the tape on balance performance. Center of Pressure Excursion (COPE) and Time to Stabilization (TTS) when landing from a hop test and Y Balance test combined score (YBTCS) were used to assess a stabilizing balance activity and a dynamic balance. The pre- and post-intervention were collected, with differences explored using repeated measures ANOVA with time and condition (tape) factor analysis. RESULTS: We found a significant improvement (p ≤ 0.05) with a moderate to large effect size in YBTCS between KT and no taping, indicating enhanced balance performance in the KT group. However, no significant difference (p ≥ 0.05) with small to moderate effect size was found in COPE or TTS between the two conditions during landing tests, suggesting similar balance capabilities in these specific measures. CONCLUSION: The use of KT shows no significant immediate effect on static balance in healthy individuals when applied to the quadriceps muscles; however, it demonstrates a positive immediate effect on dynamic balance."

Physical manifestations include pain and decreased proprioception, especially in more mobile joints, such as the shoulder. The kinesiology tape (K-Tape) is often used to treat patients with shoulder dysfunction. The effectiveness of the K-Tape is uncertain, and there is a lack of studies specifically studying the K-Tape in an EDS population. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the short-term effects of two different K-Tape procedures on shoulder active joint reposition (AJR) and active range of motion (AROM) in patients with hypermobile EDS (hEDS) and shoulder pain. METHODS: All participants were recruited from the EDS support groups and presented with shoulder pain. Baseline demographic information was obtained for each participant, after which AROM and AJR were assessed. The participants were randomized to receive one of two K-Tape procedures. Testing was repeated immediately post-taping and 48 h post-taping. RESULTS: Significant improvements in shoulder external (F = 10.917, p < 0.001) and internal (F = 11.736, p < 0.001) rotations were seen from baseline to immediately post-taping and baseline to 48 h post-taping in the experimental K-Tape group. There were no significant differences in the shoulder rotation in the control K-Tape group and no significant differences in either group for shoulder flexion or AJR at any time point (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: K-Tape may offer short-term improvements in shoulder rotation AROM in patients with hEDS and shoulder pain."

METHODS AND METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases, spanning from their inception date to December 20, 2023, to identify pertinent studies. Inclusion criteria comprised studies that (1) enrolled participants diagnosed with breast cancer-related lymphedema; (2) implemented kinesiology taping as the intervention; (3) incorporated either complete decongestive therapy, exercise, or sham taping as the control treatment; and (4) included clinical measurements such as the severity of lymphedema, upper limb function assessment, quality of life, and perceived comfort. RESULTS: Information was extracted from 14 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The analyses demonstrated statistically significant improvement, indicating a preference for kinesiology taping in the outcomes of upper limb functional assessment (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [-1.22, -0.55]), quality of life (SMD = 0.50, 95% CI: [0.16, 0.84]), and perceived comfort (SMD = 0.85, 95% CI: [0.34, 1.36]). CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that kinesiology taping could be considered a viable option for individuals dealing with breast cancer-related lymphedema. Nevertheless, acknowledging certain limitations within this study, further confirmation of its benefits necessitates additional larger-scale and better-designed RCTs.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A dysphagia rehabilitation method using kinesiology taping (KT) was recently introduced, and its potential for clinical efficacy was demonstrated by evaluating muscle activity and thickness. However, its effect on the swallowing function in patients with dysphagia remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of effortful swallowing against KT resistance on the swallowing function in patients with post stroke dysphagia. METHODS: Thirty patients with poststroke dysphagia were recruited and randomly assigned to the experimental and placebo groups. In the experimental group, the KT was attached to the front of the neck (the hyoid bone between the sternum) with a tension of approximately 70% to 80%, and effortful swallowing was performed against the KT tension. In contrast, the placebo group performed effortful swallowing with KT applied at the same location without tension. The intervention was performed 30 times/day, 5 days/week for 6 weeks. The videofluoroscopic dysphagia scale (VDS) and penetration-aspiration scale (PAS) based on a videofluoroscopic swallowing study were used to analyze oropharyngeal swallowing function. RESULTS: The experimental group showed statistically significant improvements in the oral and pharyngeal phases of the VDS (P = .029 and .007, respectively) and PAS (P = .034) compared with the placebo group. Effect sizes were observed for the oral (0.3) and pharyngeal phases (0.5) of the VDS and PAS (1.1). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that effortful swallowing against resistance to KT is an effective therapeutic exercise for improving the swallowing function in patients with poststroke dysphagia.",

For complete recovery, rehabilitation modalities are required to overcome these issues. This study investigated whether kinesio taping (KT) would reduce pain, improve gait performance, and enhance the functional capacity of turf toe patients undergoing physical therapy. METHODS: sixty patients with grade II turf toe (age; 25-30 years) assigned randomly into three treatment groups; KT applied alongside an exercise program conducted three times/week for 12 successive weeks. (KT group; n = 20), placebo taping plus exercise (Placebo group; n = 20), or exercise only (Control group; n = 20). Pain, gait parameters, and functional ability assessed using VAS, 3D gait analysis, and 6MWT respectively pre- and post-treatment. RESULTS: There was a significant post-treatment decrease in VAS score in the KT group lower than the control or placebo group and a significant increase in 6MWT distance in the KT group higher than the control or placebo group (p < 0.001). Additionally, there was a significant post-treatment increase in step length, stride length, cadence and velocity of KT group higher than control and placebo group (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in gait parameters between control and placebo groups post treatment (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the study demonstrated that KT is a useful complementary modality to exercise in patients with turf toe, as it may result in more favorable improvements to pain, gait characteristics, and functional abilities. Further studies should be conducted to assess the long-term effects, different KT application methods, and tailored treatment protocols on turf toe."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Kinesiology Taping(KT) is commonly used as a physical therapy to prevent exercise-induced fatigue. This study aims to evaluate the immediate effects of KT on muscle strength, static balance, and proprioception after eccentric muscle fatigue on ankle. METHODS: Twenty healthy male university students were recruited. The experimental protocol was structured into four sessions, each separated by a one-week washout period to prevent carryover effects. Participants were randomly allocated to one of four intervention conditions in each session, ensuring no participant received the same intervention twice. These conditions were: no taping(NT),sham taping(ST),athletic taping(AT),and kinesiology taping(KT).Taping was applied immediately following an eccentric muscle fatigue protocol targeting the ankle, and assessments were conducted in the order of proprioception, muscle strength and static balance. Isometric muscle strength and proprioception were evaluated using the Biodex isokinetic system. Static balance was measured using the TecnoBody balance platform. RESULTS: KT had a significantly higher plantarflexion/dorsiflexion peak torque, dorsiflexion average peak torque, and plantarflexion/dorsiflexion average power at 60°/s compared with NT and ST in terms of isometric muscle strength (p < 0.05).Furthermore, the plantarflexion peak torque of KT was significantly greater than AT at 60°/s[p = 0.005,95% confidence interval(CI) = 3.39 to 18.20] and 180°/s[p = 0.006,95%CI(2.62,21.98)]. In terms of proprioception, KT showed a lower absolute error in 25° plantarflexion and 10° dorsiflexion compared to NT, ST and AT. For static balance with eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions, AT and KT had a lower total sway area than NT and ST (p < 0.05). Additionally, a significant difference in total sway length with eyes-open condition was observed between AT and KT[p < 0.001,95%CI(-431.81,-168.25)];total sway area and the center of pressure(COP) velocity in the mediolateral(ML) and anteroposterior(AP) directions with eyes-closed condition were significantly lower in AT compared to KT. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that KT is more effective than other taping conditions in improving muscle strength and proprioception after eccentric muscle fatigue on ankle. However, AT is more helpful in increasing static postural control ability after ankle muscle fatigue than KT.

This study examined the effect of lower back and lower extremity kinesiology tape (KT) application on static balance and physical functioning performance in people with MS (pwMS) and compared that to a non-elastic tape. METHODS: This pilot randomized study recruited and enrolled 10 participants with MS that were allocated into two groups: kinesio (n = 6) and non-elastic (n = 4) tape. Participants were assessed with and without the respective tape on static balance with eyes open and closed and various physical function tests. RESULTS: Effect sizes for the Kinesio tape intervention were found to be small, while effect sizes for the sham tape/place condition varied from small to high. For both groups, the tendency was to reduce or maintain performance on the tests comparing tape and no tape. A subsequent, mixed-factor ANOVA revealed no significant difference between KT or sham tape/placebo. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that KT applied on lower back and lower extremity muscles does not seem to improve static balance and physical function performance in pwMS.",

Our aim in this study was to determine the acute effect of KT applied to the rectus femoris muscle on this muscle's activation, functionality and proprioception in patients with knee osteoarthritis. We divided 40 individuals diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis into two groups: (a) KT group (taping with tension facilitation) and (b) a placebo group (taping with no tension facilitation). We applied taping to the participants' left and right side rectus femoris muscles for 30 minutes, but with muscle facilitation in the KT group and without tension in the placebo group. We assessed participants for muscle activation with surface electromyography (sEMG), for functionality with the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), and for proprioception/joint sense with the Five Times Sit-to-Stand Test (5TSTS) before and after taping. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the groups before these interventions were similar (p > .05). Muscle activation did not change significantly in either group compared to before taping (p > .05), but there were improvements in both knees for proprioception/joint sense (p < .05). Both groups were similar in terms of functionality (5TSTS, TUG) results (p > .05). We concluded that KT applied bilaterally to the rectus femoris did not affect rectus femoris muscle activation and functionality in patients with knee OA, but it did improve proprioception.",

Kinesiology tape (KT), also known as elastic tape, is widely used in sports medicine. Plantar fasciitis, due to inflammation of the plantar fascia, is a common cause of heel pain. This study aimed to compare the effects of dynamic taping and KT on pain, function, and balance in 3 groups of patients with plantar fasciitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS Sixty-nine patients with plantar fasciitis were randomly assigned to the dynamic taping with physical therapy (PT) group, the KT with PT group, and the control group (23 each). All groups received conservative physical therapy. Dynamic taping and KT were performed twice a week for 4 weeks, and the taping was removed after 12 h of application. Patients' pain, foot function, and balance were assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS), foot function index (FFI), and Y-balance test (YBT), respectively, before and immediately after the intervention. RESULTS In the FFI and YBT, the treatment provided to the dynamic taping with PT group with PT showed a greater effect than in the KT with PT group with PT (P<0.05), and the control group showed the lowest effect. Dynamic taping and KT with PT did not show significant differences in VAS and foot pressure, but both were more effective than the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The results of this study suggest that dynamic taping with PT is the most effective method for FFI and YBT in patients with plantar fasciitis, and that dynamic taping and KT with PT are effective methods for treating pain and foot pressure.",

Kinesiology taping (KT) is a therapeutic method used in patients with neurological diseases, such as stroke, as well as in patients after orthopedic and sports injuries. This study aimed to compare outcomes of AFO treatment with those of KT to investigate the effect on gait ability in patients with foot drop after stroke. We recruited 18 patients exhibiting foot drop from stroke. Gait ability was assessed under 2 conditions: treatment with KT and that with AFO using the GAITRite system according to the following parameters: cadence, velocity, swing time, stance time, step length, and stride length. As a result, gait ability after treatment with KT and that after treatment with AFO showed no significant differences in cadence (P = .851), velocity (P = .865), swing time (P = .289 and .123), stance time (P = .255 and .711), step length (P = .955 and .975), and stride length (P = .711 and .690) of the affected and less-affected limbs. This study demonstrated that KT and AFO use have similar effects on gait function in patients with foot drop after stroke. Thus, treatment of foot drop with KT may be an alternative in patients for whom AFO use is contraindicated.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a group of inherited connective tissue disorders which predominantly affects women and has a prevalence as high as 1 in 5,000 individuals. Hypermobile EDS (hEDS) is the most common subtype of EDS and is characterized by multi-joint pain, particularly in large joints such as the shoulder. Physical therapy is often utilized to address the pain, physical impairments, and functional loss in patients with EDS. Kinesiology Tape (KT) is an intervention commonly used by physical therapists for treating shoulder pain and dysfunction. Studies related to the effectiveness of KT in patients with shoulder pain is equivocal and there are a lack of studies specifically studying the effects of KT in an EDS population. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and short-term effects of two different KT techniques on shoulder pain and function in individuals with hEDS and shoulder pain. METHODS: Participants were recruited from EDS support groups in the New England area of the United States; were diagnosed with hEDS by their physician; and had shoulder pain. Baseline demographic information was obtained for each participant followed by completion of 4 patient reported outcome (PRO) measures: the Upper Extremity Functional Index, QuickDASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, & Hand), Shoulder Pain and Disability Index, and the Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index. Current pain level, average pain over the past 24 h, and worst pain over the past 24 h were recorded using the numeric pain rating scale (NPRS). Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either an experimental shoulder KT procedure or a control shoulder taping. Immediately after taping, the NPRS was reassessed. Subjects then returned 48 h later to repeat the NPRS and PRO measures. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the experimental and control tape groups for any outcome measure. There was a significant improvement from pre-taping to 48-hours post taping for each of the 4 PRO measures with large effect sizes (p < 0.001; ƞ p 2 = .517-.719). Likewise, average, and worst pain over the last 24 h significantly improved with large effect sizes over the same period (p = 0.005; ƞ p 2 = .225 and p < 0.001; ƞ p 2 = .382, respectively). Current NPRS levels significantly improved from pre-tape to immediately post-tape (p = .023, ƞ p 2 = .131) and was maintained through the 48-hour follow up, although no further improvement was seen. CONCLUSION: KT is an inexpensive and relatively safe intervention that is easy to apply and can offer temporary improvements in pain and function for patients with EDS and shoulder pain."

Athletic tape and kinesiology tape applications are among the external support treatment options especially for athletes to support the ankle and protect it from recurrent sprains. We sought to compare the kinematic stabilization effects of different ankle taping applications on the ankle joint during drop landing in individuals with a history of unilateral lateral ankle injury. METHODS: In this randomized controlled study, 30 volunteers with unilateral ankle injury were evaluated. The participants were asked to land on one leg on the involved side and the contralateral side from a 30-cm-high platform. The same practice was repeated after applying kinesiology tape and rigid tape to the injured foot. Kinematic analysis of the foot and ankle was performed by recording three-dimensional spatial position information at a speed of 240 frames per second using infrared cameras. RESULTS: The highest inversion angles of the involved foot at initial contact and 150 msec after initial contact were higher than those of the uninvolved side (P = .03 and P = .04, respectively). There was no significant difference in ankle kinematic values in the involved foot among kinesiology taping, athletic taping, and no taping applications (P = .74). CONCLUSIONS: People with lateral ankle sprains show reduced inversion during landing. There were no significant differences among kinesiology taping, athletic taping, and no taping on the injured foot in terms of ankle kinematics. Care should be taken when using taping materials as protective measures for sports activities.",

The swelling thickness and range of mobility were measured on the third and eighth days after the operation. RESULTS: A statistical difference between the longitudinal measurements of the KT group and the group without KT application was shown at the level of the fibula head, 25 mm below the fibula neck, and 50 mm below the fibular neck. There were no statistically significant differences in the change in knee angle between the applied and non-applied patients.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Kinesiology tape indications of use include pain mitigation, neurosensory input, and promotion of circulation. Current evidence suggests that residual functional limitations following intramedullary nailing of the femoral shaft may be due to soft tissue injury and compromise. This retrospective study from a single center aimed to compare the effects of kinesiology taping on edema of the lower limb in 14 patients following intramedullary nailing for femoral shaft fracture. MATERIAL AND METHODS The randomized control trial design consisting of 2 groups totaling 14 patients. The intervention group (n=7) received standard therapy and kinesiology tape decompression/fan application. The control group (n=7) received standard therapy with no kinesiology tape. Outcome measures included limb girth tape measurements, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain, involved knee ROM goniometry, and Timed Up and Go (TUG). RESULTS Results of this study showed there was a decrease in limb volume in the control group and an increase in limb volume in the intervention group. Both groups had improvements in TUG scores. The only statistically significant finding was among the control group, which had a decrease of 1.6 in mean VAS score before and after IM nailing (P=0.010). CONCLUSIONS In this study from a single center, kinesiology tape in patients with intramedullary nailing for femoral shaft fracture did not significantly reduce the volume of the lower limb, reduce pain, or improve postoperative mobility. The only significant improvement from the use of kinesiology tape was improved active knee extension due to improvement in quadriceps force.",

METHODS: A total of 37 patients were randomized in three groups: those who received TST and NMES as Group 1 (n:12), those who received both TST and KT as Group 2 (n:13), and those who received TST, NMES, and KT together as Group 3 (n:12). Patients were evaluated before treatment, after treatment, and three months after treatment onset with bedside water-swallow test, Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10), Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS), penetration-aspiration scale (PAS), and National Institute of Health-Swallow Safety Scale (NIH-SSS). FOIS, PAS, and NIS-SSS were completed according to results of fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). RESULTS: A statistically significant decrease was observed in bedside water-swallow test, EAT-10, PAS, and NIH-SSS scores in all treatment groups 5 weeks and 3 months after treatment onset compared to pre-treatment scores (p < 0.05). There was a statistically significant increase in FOIS scores 5 weeks and 3 months after treatment compared to pretreatment scores in all treatment groups (p < 0.05). When the pre-treatment, 3-week, and 5-month swallow scale scores of all groups were compared, there was no significant different difference in terms of bedside water-swallow test, EAT-10, FOIS, PAS, or NIH-SSS scores (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: According to the results of our study, KT is a new option in the treatment of stroke-related dysphagia, is an effective treatment approach and its efficacy is maintained throughout long-term follow-up.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Hammertoe, one of the most common toe deformities, causes pain due to overloading of the periarticular tissues and skin lesions. Additionally, it results in problems with footwear choice, an unattractive foot appearance and a deterioration in quality of life. The most common treatment for rigid and advanced deformities is surgery, and these procedures are widely described in literature. If the changes in the interphalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints are flexible (that mean they undergo correction without causing pain) or surgery is not possible, conservative treatment should be considered. No research, however, has been found detailing this treatment method. Conservative treatment includes the Kinesiology Taping (KT) method, which involves applying taping to correct deformities. This report describes the effect of KT treatment in a female patient with hammertoes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anthropometric foot measurements (3D scanner) and foot loadings (baropodometric platform) are presented before KT applying, immediately after tapes application and after tapes removal following one month of use. RESULTS: After using KT application parameters such as: foot length, maximum foot load, load under the area of the metatarsals II-III changed. CONCLUSION: Kinesiology Taping seems to be a symptomatic form of treatment of the effects of lesser toes deformity, therefore it is a good alternative for patients who do not want or cannot undergo surgery."

The aim of this study was to evaluate hindfoot position and loading pattern after a treatment of Kinesiology Taping (KT) for the mechanical correction of hallux valgus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study involved 25 feet with hallux valgus deformity and hindfoot valgus. The hallux valgus angle (HVA) and hindfoot angle were assessed with a 3D scanner. Hindfoot loading pattern was examined with a baropodometric platform while standing and during gait. Measurements were taken on the following three occasions: before and immediately after KT placement as well as after a month of taping. RESULTS: The KT treatment had a significant influence on the hindfoot angle (p&lt;0.001) and HVA (p&lt;0.001) measured while standing and on lateral heel loading in dynamic conditions during gait (p&lt;0.01). CONCLUSIONS: 1. KT decreased HVA and improved hindfoot position while standing in the pilot study participants. 2. KT exerted a corrective influence on the foot loading pattern in patients with hallux valgus and hindfoot pronation. 3. The foot position correction and normalisation of foot loading achieved in the pilot study provide a basis for further research on KT effectiveness in patients with hallux valgus and hindfoot pronation.",

Forty patients with unilateral stage 2 BCRL were randomized to either the CDT group (n=20) or the KT group (n=20). Patients in the CDT group underwent 30-min manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) and multi-layer, short-stretch bandaging once a week for four weeks. Patients in the KT group underwent taping once a week for four weeks. In addition, all patients were informed about skin care and given an exercise program throughout the treatment. Upper extremity circumference and volume differences as primary outcomes and grip strength, Quick-Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (Q-DASH), and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) scores as secondary outcomes were assessed initially, after treatment (4 weeks), and at the 1st month follow-up. Limb circumference and volume differences were significantly reduced in the CDT group after the 4-week treatment compared with the KT group (p=0.012 and p=0.015, respectively), but there was no difference between the groups in the 1st month follow-up (p>0.05). There was no difference between the groups in terms of grip strength, Q-DASH, and FACT-B scores after treatment and at the 1st month follow-up (p>0.05). Our results show that both KT and CDT were found to significantly reduce limb volume and circumference individually at 4-weeks and the one-month follow-up in patients with BCRL and that CDT significantly reduced both limb volume and circumference compared to KT at the 4- week time point, but not at the follow-up. Further randomized controlled trials with patients at different stages of BCRL are needed to confirm and expand these results.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Subacromial impingement syndrome (SAIS) is a common cause of shoulder pain. The effects of physiotherapy modalities including low-level laser (LLL) and high power laser (HPL) on the SAIS have mostly been evaluated by the subjective outcome variables accompanied with the controversial findings and none of them has compared a combination of these two modalities, yet. OBJECTIVES: The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of low-level laser (LLL) and high power laser (HPL) combined with kinesiology taping (KT), on the pain, function, and musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSKUS) parameters in the SAIS. METHODS: Thirty patients with SAIS were randomly divided into the LLL-KT, HPL-KT, and sham-KT groups, respectively. Patients received seven treatment sessions. Visual analogue scale (VAS), shoulder pain and disability index (SPADI), MSKUS parameters were measured before and 48 hours after the treatment cessation. RESULTS: Pain intensity significantly reduced in the LLL-KT (-2.43 (0.97)), HPL-KT (-3.43 (1.99)), and sham-KT (-2.43 (1.62)) (P < .01). All the SPADI subscales are significantly reduced in all the groups (P < .05), except for the pain in the sham-KT (P = .06). Significant improvements were only observed in the diameters of biceps (P < .05), supraspinatus tendon thickness in short and long axes (P < .05), occupation ratio (P = .004), and echogenicity (P = .03) in the HPL-KT. Although the acromiohumoral distance (AHD) significantly increased in all the groups including the sham-KT (P < .01), supraspinatus tendon thickness significantly decreased (P < .05), and echogenicity increased (P = .003) just in the HPL-KT. CONCLUSIONS: Kinesiology taping method alone is an effective intervention. Nevertheless, adding the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of both LLL and HPL to KT seems to result in better improvement of the pain, function, and MSKUS parameters in the SAIS. Findings of this study suggested that the HPL is more beneficial than the LLL or KT alone for management of the patients with SAIS.",

While there have been several studies published to date evaluating the effectiveness of this intervention, a systematic review with meta-analysis synthesizing the collective effectiveness of kinesiology taping is not available. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review with meta-analysis investigating the efficacy and treatment fidelity of kinesiology taping (KT) in combination with conservative interventions for shoulder pain. METHODS: Databases (PubMed, EMBASE, SportDiscus, CINAHL) of studies published in English meeting criteria were searched to October 2019. Methodologic quality was assessed utilizing the Modified Downs and Black checklist. Treatment fidelity was evaluated using a modified fidelity tool. Random effects meta-analyses were performed when an outcome (disability, pain, range of motion (ROM)) was reported by two or more studies. Overall effect size (pooled random effects) was estimated for studies with acceptable clinical homogeneity. RESULTS: When KT was used with conservative treatments, meta-analysis revealed large effect sizes for improvements in disability (standard mean difference (SMD) = -1.35; 95% CI, -2.09 to -0.60) and ROM (SMD = 0.96; 95% CI, 0.60-1.33) with no significant effects for pain. The average Modified Downs & Black score for bias was 11.5 ± 3.9. Of 10 retained studies, only two had good treatment fidelity. CONCLUSIONS: Adding KT to interventions performed in clinical settings appears to demonstrate efficacy regarding disability and ROM when compared to conservative interventions alone. However, despite reasonably good methodologic quality, fidelity was lacking in a majority of studies. Because of its impact on the implementation of evidence-based practice, lower fidelity should be considered when interpreting results."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM), tissue flossing, and kinesiology taping are increasingly popular treatments among athletes for improving functional performance, despite limited evidence for their efficacy. OBJECTIVE: Previous research regarding the efficacy of soft tissues and neuromuscular techniques on improving functional capacity of shoulder joints in athletes has yielded conflicting results. We examined the immediate and short-term effects of IASTM, flossing, and kinesiology taping on the functional capacities of amateur athletes' shoulders. DESIGN: Randomized controlled study. SETTING: Clinical assessment laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty amateur overhead athletes (mean [SD]: age = 23.03 [1.89]; weight = 78.36 [5.32]; height = 1.77 [.11]). INTERVENTIONS: We randomly assigned participants to 4 research sub-groups in which they received the following treatments on their dominant shoulders: IASTM (n = 20), flossing (n = 20), both IASTM and flossing (n = 20), and kinesiology tape (n = 20). Nondominant shoulders served as controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: We evaluated participants-before, immediately after, and 45 minutes after the therapeutic interventions-with the following tests: internal and external shoulder rotation range of motion, isokinetic strength and total work, the functional throwing performance index, and the one-arm seated shot put throw performance. RESULTS: All therapeutic interventions significantly improved the strength and functional performance of the dominant shoulder in comparison with the control (P < .005) immediately after and 45 minutes after the treatment. The IASTM led to significantly greater improvement in shoulder internal rotation than kinesiology taping immediately after (P = .049) and 45 minutes after the treatment (P = .049). We observed no significant differences between the other treatment interventions (P > .05). CONCLUSION: Findings from the current study support the use of novel soft tissue and neuromuscular techniques for the immediate and short-term improvement of the shoulder functional capacities in amateur overhead athletes.",

In this study we wanted to verify if kinesiology taping improves hallux valgus and affects the position as well as reducing pain. Materials and Methods: Forty feet with hallux valgus were examined and the parameters were measured at three stages: before the kinesiology taping was applied, just after its application and after a month of use. Measurements were taken with a 3D scanner and a baropodometric platform. Results: When taping was applied, the hallux valgus angle decreased statistically significantly compared with pre-taping (p < 0.01). The use of taping for a month significantly reduced this angle compared with pre-taping (p < 0.05). Parameters such as foot length, the surface of the hindfoot and forefoot and hindfoot pressure on the ground changed. A change in the hallux position due to the taping produced significant changes in the perception of pain (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Kinesiology taping acts on the hallux valgus and foot position mechanically. This makes kinesiology taping an effective method of conservative treatment for patients who are not qualified for surgery.",

OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of Kinesiology Taping (KT) on foot loading during gait in patients with hallux valgus. METHODS: Forty feet with hallux valgus were examined. Patients wore the KT for a month and the parameters of the foot during gait on a baropodometric platform were measured three times: before taping, immediately after application of taping and after one month's use. RESULTS: The taping had a statistically significant effect on dynamic foot measurements. The maximum and mean foot load (p< 0.001), foot surface (p< 0.001), ratio of forefoot to hindfoot load (p< 0.01) and the proportions of the lateral and medial foot loading (p< 0.05) all changed. During gait cycle, taping significantly increased the load and surface at the first metatarsal head (p< 0.001) while there was a decrease around the second to fifth (p< 0.001) metatarsal heads. CONCLUSIONS: Using KT to correct a hallux valgus is a procedure that has an impact on the dynamic parameters of the foot during gait. The use of this method could become an alternative to surgical treatment for those patients, who have any contraindication for surgery.",

The treatment options for MPS include a variety of conservative approaches, however, the effect of kinesiology taping (KT), which is a feasible and effective treatment choice for musculoskeletal pathologies, has not been studied. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the efficacy of KT in addition to exercise in terms of pain severity, pain threshold, functional muscle strength of lower extremity, dynamic balance, functional status, and quality of life in patients with MPS. METHODS: Eighty participants with MPS were randomly and equally divided into two groups: 1) the KT group, which received KT in addition to a 6-week exercise program; and 2) the control group, which received the 6-week exercise program alone. The following evaluations were conducted before and after the treatment; pain threshold, pain severity, disability level, functional strength and dynamic balance of the lower extremity, and quality of life. RESULTS: Pain intensity decreased during activity, at rest, and night (KT group p < .001; control group p ≤ 0.013), and pain thresholds increased (KT group p < .001; control group p = .008) in both groups, however, the after treatment measures were better in the KT group (p ≤ 0.012). The time taken to complete the stairs up and down test decreased in both groups (KT group p < .001, control group p = .007) with a better outcome in the KT group (p = .024). Disability scores improved significantly in the KT only (p < .001). The quality of life improved in both groups (KT group p < .001; control group p = .005). CONCLUSIONS: While exercise therapy is beneficial in MPS treatment for functionality and pain relief; KT, in addition to exercise, improved symptoms and decreased impairment more efficiently than exercise alone in patients with MPS in our study, and it is thus a favorable treatment option for MPS.",

      "abstract": "AIM: The data on the action mechanism of the kinesiology taping (KT) used to reduce pain and inflammation, provide mechanical support, and facilitate or inhibit muscles in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee are contradictory. The aim of this study was to investigate the acute effects of KT treatment on muscle strength, tissue temperature, balance, and mobility in female patients diagnosed with OA of the knee. METHODS: Thirty-four female patients (age: 60.26 ± 6.51 years) who were diagnosed with Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 2 OA according to the American Rheumatology Association (ACR-1986) criteria were included in the study. Patients who were performed KT with the superior Y, inferior Y, and U strip techniques were evaluated before and 30 min after taping. Muscle strength was assessed with a handheld dynamometer, tissue temperature with a thermal camera, balance with a monoaxial balance platform, and mobility the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. RESULTS: After taping, there was a significant increase in the muscle strength during both extension and flexion (p<.001, p=.005). There was no statistically significant difference in the tissue temperature and balance scores before and after taping (p=.219, p>.05). There was a significant improvement in TUG scores, which evaluated mobility, after taping (p=.033). CONCLUSIONS: Although KT treatment seems to be ineffective on tissue temperature and balance in the short term in patients with OA of the knee, we are of the opinion that patients should be included in the treatment program due to its positive effects on muscle strength and mobility.",

CLINICAL FEATURES: A female patient presented to a chiropractic clinic with ongoing anteromedial knee pain whenever she walks. The patient reported being unable to walk a half mile without her knee feeling like it would \"give out.\" INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: The patient received 5 treatments focusing on the pelvic imbalance and reduced muscle strength discovered in the patient's initial evaluation. Chiropractic manipulation of the sacroiliac joint, kinesiology taping, and gluteus medius exercises were administered. The Verbal Rating Scale, muscle strength assessment, and orthopedic evaluation measured the patient's progress. After 5 treatments the Verbal Rating Scale went from 8 to 1 and gluteus medius strength scored 5 of 5. CONCLUSION: The patient in this case reported resolution of her knee pain after 5 treatments over the course of 10 days. The patient reported no pain while walking nor while performing other activities of daily living. Although this is one case, correcting pelvic balance via conservative measures resolved the knee pain. Implementing therapy proximal to the complaint may be a viable option for patients with knee pain."

[Participants and Methods] We conducted a single-group pre-post design pilot feasibility study. Thirteen individuals with post-stroke hemiplegia were recruited for this study. All patients received therapeutic trunk KT on the skin, representing the direction of fibres of the trunk muscles underneath. We used the Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS) and Trunk Control Test (TCT) to measure trunk function, Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) for balance, limits of stability (LOS) to evaluate balance, and the modified Rivermead mobility index (MRMI) to assess mobility in post-stroke patients. All measures were assessed before and immediately after the intervention. [Results] No adverse effects were found and all patients completed the trial. Compared to the baseline, TIS scores were significantly increased after KT, whereas no changes in TCT score were detected. The directional control of LOS was significantly improved, while no significant changes were seen in the other parameters of LOS, FMA-balance, and MRMI scores. [Conclusion] The results of this investigation show that trunk KT has immediate effects that improve certain trunk functional and balance parameters in stroke patients."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The ability to maintain balance is essential for both remaining in the standing position and preventing falls. Physical therapy techniques such as kinesiology taping (KT) and stretching are considered to be effective measures in ameliorating balance issues. However, there is no available study comparing the effects of these two methods on postural control. Thus, the current study aims to investigate and compare the efficacy of interventions accomplished through these methods on young and elderly subjects. METHOD: In a single-blind randomized clinical trial, 40 young subjects (<30 years) and 40 elderly subjects (>60 years) were randomly assigned to two groups of KT and stretching. In the first group, inhibitory tape was applied to the gastrocnemius muscle. In the second group, 60 s of stretch was repeated 4 times. The static balance was evaluated before and after the interventions using the single-leg standing (SLS) test along with measurements of the velocity and displacement of the center of pressure by the force plate. RESULTS: Based on the Mann-Whitney test, there were no significant differences between the tape and stretching techniques in the study variables of either group of participants, before and after the interventions (p > 0.05). However, the results of the Wilcoxon test showed a significant increase in single-leg stance time in the stretching group in the elderly subjects (p = 0.03). MANOVA results demonstrated significant group and time effects only in the SLS parameter (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Stretching the gastrocnemius seems to be more efficacious than KT for improving balance problems in older adults. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Kinesiology taping (KT) is used in musculoskeletal practice for preventive and rehabilitative purposes. It is claimed that KT improves blood flow in the microcirculation by creating skin convolutions and that this reduces swelling and facilitates healing of musculoskeletal injuries. There is a paucity of physiological studies evaluating the effect of KT on cutaneous blood microcirculation. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this parallel-group controlled laboratory repeated measures design study was to evaluate the effects of KT on cutaneous blood microcirculation in healthy human adults using a dual wavelength (infrared and visible-red) laser Doppler Imaging (LDI) system. KT was compared with rigid taping and no taping controls to isolate the effects associated with the elasticity of KT. METHODS: Forty-five healthy male and female human adults were allocated to one of the three interventions using constrained randomisation following the pre-intervention measurement: (i) KT (ii) ST (standard taping) (iii) NT (no taping). Cutaneous blood perfusion was measured using LDI in the ventral surface of forearm at pre-intervention, during-intervention and post-intervention in a normothermic environment at resting conditions. RESULTS: Mixed ANOVA of both infrared and visible-red datasets revealed no statistically significant interaction between Intervention and Time. There was statistically significant main effect for Time but not Intervention. CONCLUSION: KT does not increase cutaneous blood microcirculation in healthy human adults under resting physiological conditions in a normothermic environment. On the contrary, evidence suggests that taping, regardless of the elasticity in the tape, is associated with immediate reductions in cutaneous blood flow.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Kinesiology taping (KT) is used to manage musculoskeletal-related pain. There is a paucity of physiological studies evaluating the effect of KT on stimulus-evoked experimental pain. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of KT (applied to lumbar region) on cutaneous somatosensation to noxious and innocuous stimuli in humans with a non-sensitised normally functioning nociceptive system using quantitative sensory testing (QST). METHODS: Fifty-four participants were randomised to one of three interventions: (i) KT (ii) standard 'rigid' taping (ST) (iii) sham taping (ShT). QST measurements were taken at lumbar sites pre-intervention (T1), during-intervention (T2) and during-intervention (T3) in the following sequence: warm-detection-threshold (WDT), heat-pain-threshold (HTPh), heat-pain-tolerance (HPTo), mechanical-detection-threshold (MDT), mechanical-pain-threshold (MPT) and pressure-pain-threshold (PPT). RESULTS: Mixed ANOVA revealed statistically significant interaction between Intervention and Time on MDT (p < .0005) and MPT (p < .0005) but not on WDT (p = .09), HPTh (p = .09), HPTo (p = .51) and PPT (p = .52) datasets. There was no significant simple main effect of Intervention on MDT at T2 (p = .68) and T3 (p = .24), and MPT at T2 (p = .79) and T3 (p = .54); post-hoc tests found KT and ST groups had higher (but non-significant) MDT and MPT than the ShT group. There was a significant simple main effect of Time on MDT and MPT for KT (p < .0005) and ST (p < .0005) groups; post-hoc tests found significant increases in MDT and MPT at T3 and T2 compared with T1 in both KT and ST groups. There was no significant simple main effect of Time on MDT (p = .13) nor MPT (p = .08) for the ShT group. CONCLUSION: Taping, irrespective of the elasticity, may modulate cutaneous mechanosensation. KT, ST and ShT seemed to have similar influence on cutaneous thermal and deep pressure nociception.",

DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. SETTING: the Rehabilitation Center of the West China Hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Nineteen individuals suffering from HSP were recruited in this study. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned into the taping group or control group. The taping group received therapeutic kinesiology taping and conventional treatment, while the control group received placebo taping (applied without tension) and conventional treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The shoulder pain intensity (numerical pain rating scale), magnitude of subluxation, muscle activity (measured by surface electromyography (sEMG)), and shoulder active range of movement (AROM) were assessed at the baseline, on the first day (immediately after taping) and 4 weeks after treatment (without taping). RESULTS: All patients completed the trials. There were no significant differences between groups at the baseline. The taping group showed immediate improvement on the first day after taping in terms of pain intensity, magnitude of subluxation, and muscle activity (p < 0.05), whereas no significant changes seen in the control group (p > 0.05). After 4 weeks of treatment, the taping group showed significant changes in pain intensity, magnitude of subluxation, muscle activity, and AROM (p < 0.05). And significant differences in pain intensity and muscle activity could be seen between the two groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the kinesiology taping is effective in reducing the shoulder pain and subluxation and increasing muscle activity and AROM for patients with HSP after stroke.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 61 female patients (mean age 53.5±3.5 years; range 50 to 60 years) who were admitted to Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Outpatient Clinic with complaints of mechanical knee pain. Knee osteoarthritis was diagnosed according to the clinical/ radiological criteria of the American College of Rheumatology and patients with Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2 and 3 were included. Patients were randomly divided into two groups. Both groups received transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation for 30 minutes, hot pack for 30 minutes, and therapeutic ultrasound for 10 minutes in a day for three weeks (five days in a week). Also, one group was treated with KT (KT group, n=31) while the other group was treated with sham-KT (sham-KT group, n=30) one time a week for three weeks. A home program of around the knee strengthening exercises was recommended for all patients. All patients were evaluated with visual analog scale, Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) values, goniometric measurement of active knee range of motion, 50-meter walking distance, and isokinetic knee extensor muscle peak torque measurements before treatment, at the end of treatment, and at one month and three months after treatment. RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in after treatment and first month visual analog scale values in the KT group compared to the sham-KT group (p<0.05). In the KT group, the WOMAC pain and WOMAC total scores decreased significantly after treatment compared to the sham-KT group (p<0.05). Visual analog scale values were significantly decreased after treatment in both groups (p<0.05). In both groups; WOMAC pain, stiffness, physical function, and total values decreased significantly after treatment (p<0.05). In both groups, isokinetic quadriceps peak torque measurements were increased after treatment (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The application of KT to females with knee osteoarthritis appears to be a method that may be effective on pain and functional capacity."

OBJECTIVES: To critically appraise and establish best available evidence for the efficacy of truncal application of kinesiology taping combined with physiotherapy, versus physiotherapy alone, on gross motor function (GMF) in children with CP. METHOD: Seven databases were searched using the terms CP, kinesio taping and/or kinesiology tape and/or taping, physiotherapy and/or physical therapy and GMF. Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included and appraised using the PEDro scale. Revman© Review Manager was used to combine effects for GMF in sitting, standing and activities of daily living. RESULTS: Five level IIB RCTs that scored 3-6/8 on the PEDro scale were included. Meta-analysis showed that taping was effective for improving GMF in sitting and standing as measured by the Gross Motor Function Measure (B) (p < 0.001) and (D) (p < 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSION: There is moderate evidence to support kinesiology taping applied to the trunk as an effective intervention when used as an adjunct to physiotherapy to improve GMF in children with CP, especially those with GMF Classification Scale levels I and II, and particularly for improving sitting control. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Kinesiology taping is a useful adjunct to physiotherapy intervention in higher functioning children with CP. Current evidence however is weak and further research into methods of truncal application is recommended."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Proprioception and body balance after knee arthroplasty have a considerable impact on restoration of joint function and a normal gait pattern. Kinesiology Taping (KT) is a method that may be able to influence these factors. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of KT application on sensorimotor efficiency, balance and gait in patients undergoing rehabili-ta--tion after knee replacement surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study involved 120 male and female patients (mean age was 69 years) after total knee repla-cement. The patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: Experimental Group (n=51) and Control Group (n=60). Both groups underwent standard rehabilitation lasting 20 days. In addition, the Experimental Group received KT applications. Treat-ment outcomes were assessed based on tests evaluating balance, joint position sense and functional gait performance, conducted both before and after the therapy. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements were noted across all the parameters assessed in the Experimental Group (p&lt;0.005). Significant improvements were also seen in the Control Group (p&lt;0.005), but, in percentage terms, the improvement was higher in the Experimental Group. The only exception was the right/left foot load distribution, whose symmetry improved proportionally in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Patients after knee replacement surgery have considerable proprioception deficits, impaired body balance and reduced functional performance, which may increase the risk of falls in this group of patients. 2. Both standard physiotherapy and combination therapy with Kinesiology Taping (modified by the present authors) used in patients after knee arthroplasty may considerably improve the level of proprioception, body balance and overall functional performance. 3. The technique of dynamic taping proposed in this paper may optimise standard physiotherapy used in patients after knee arthroplasty and increase its clinical efficacy. Further studies are required.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study aims to compare the efficacy of extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) and kinesiology taping in the treatment of plantar fasciitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 80 patients diagnosed with plantar fasciitis. The patients were randomized into two groups as ESWT (9 males, 28 females; mean age 47.8±12.4 years; range 40 to 55 years) and kinesiology taping (KT, 7 males, 26 females; mean age 47.7±9.8 years; range 40 to 55 years) groups. Groups were similar regarding age, sex, and body mass index (all p>0.05). Three patients in ESWT group and seven patients in KT group were lost to follow-up. ESWT was applied once a week for five weeks, while KT was applied every five days for five weeks. Patients' pain and functional status were evaluated with visual analog scale, heel tenderness index, and foot and ankle outcome score before and after treatment. RESULTS: At the study onset, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in their visual analog scale, heel tenderness index, and foot and ankle outcome scores. Five weeks later, both groups showed significant improvement in all parameters (p<0.05), but no significant differences were observed between the groups in the visual analog scale, heel tenderness index, and foot and ankle outcome score scores. CONCLUSION: Both ESWT and KT treatments improved pain levels and function and quality of life in individuals with plantar fasciitis. Neither method was superior in treating plantar fasciitis."

Kinesiology taping (KT) may provide improvement in hemiplegic shoulder pain and upper extremity function after an acute stroke. AIM: To assess the impact of KT on HSP, upper extremity functional outcomes, and the prevention of shoulder soft tissue injury in subacute stroke patients with hemiplegic shoulders during rehabilitation. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind controlled trial. SETTING: Rehabilitation unit at a single medical center. POPULATION: Forty-four subacute stroke patients with hemiplegia. METHODS: Forty-four subacute stroke patients with hemiplegia participated in this study and were randomly allocated to the control group (sham KT) or experimental group (therapeutic KT). In the experimental group, a 3-week therapeutic KT with conventional inpatient rehabilitation was applied for 5 days per week. In the control group, the patients received a 3-week sham KT with conventional inpatient rehabilitation for 5 days per week. Shoulder subluxation, spasticity, hemiplegic shoulder pain, the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Upper Extremity (FMA-UE), modified Barthel Index (MI), Stroke-Specific Quality of Life (SSQOL) scale, and shoulder sonography were measured before and after treatment. RESULTS: Pain-free flexion was significantly increased in hemiplegic shoulders after therapeutic KT. From 16 (70%) to 20 (87%) patients in the control and from 12 (57%) to 12 (57%) in the experimental groups had HSP after intervention, and a significant difference in the occurrence of HSP was found between these groups after treatment (P<0.05). Significant improvements (P<0.05) were noted in the FMA-UE, modified BI, and SSQOL scales after treatment in both groups. No significant differences between the groups were seen on shoulder sonography (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic KT may limit the development of HSP and improve shoulder flexion in subacute stroke patients with flaccid shoulders during inpatient rehabilitation. For subacute stroke patients with hemiplegia, therapeutic KT may not provide improvements in the upper extremity function, daily activity, and quality of life over sham KT during conventional inpatient rehabilitation. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Kinesiology taping may provide positive effects on shoulder flexion and decrease the occurrence of HSP in subacute stroke patients with hemiplegic shoulders during conventional inpatient rehabilitation.",

The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of kinesiology taping in the early postoperative phase after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). We hypothesized that kinesiology taping reduces knee pain and swelling and improves knee range of movement and functional outcome. DESIGN: Randomized controlled study. SETTING: Primary Institutional Hospital. PATIENTS: Sixty subjects who underwent an elective ACLR with or without concurrent meniscectomy were randomized into intervention (with kinesiology taping postsurgery) and control groups. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects from both groups received standardized postoperative physiotherapy. Subjects from the intervention group received additional kinesiology taping on the first and second weeks postsurgery, each application lasting 5 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain visual analogue score (VAS), total range of motion (ROM) of the knee, Lysholm-Tegner scale, and mid patella circumferential girth were measured before the surgery and at the first, second, and sixth week postsurgery. RESULTS: Within each group, statistically significant differences were found in all study parameters in both groups. Comparison of the study parameters between both groups revealed no statistical significance at various time points except the reduction of pain in the taping group in the early postoperative phase (between the first and second week) (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first randomized controlled study investigating the efficacy of kinesiology taping in arthroscopic knee surgery. Our study showed that kinesiology taping reduced pain in the early postoperative period after ACLR. There was no statistical significance in the reduction of swelling or improvement of knee score and total range of motion with kinesiology taping.",

This review aims to determine the effectiveness and safety of kinesiotaping (KT) in the management of CRL compared to compression bandaging or hosiery. A systematic search of the literature was conducted until July 2015. The primary outcomes were reduction in body part volume or circumference and adverse effects of the interventions. The secondary outcomes were subjective experience of the treatment, severity of lymphoedema-related symptoms and patients' quality of life (QoL). Six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this review. Five were included in the meta-analysis of the primary outcome limb volume (n = 203, KTn = 91, compression n = 112). It revealed no significant difference between the interventions [WMD -205.33 mL CI (-454.69 to 44.04) P = 0.11]. An increased risk of skin complications with KT was reported in five studies affecting between 10% and 21% of patients. Where lymphoedema-related symptoms were reported KT was found to be superior to compression. Paradoxically, patients receiving bandaging reported a higher QoL. KT was not found to be more comfortable than bandaging. KT should only be used with great caution where bandaging cannot be used.",

We tested the safety and efficacy of KT in reducing postoperative chest pain after lung lobectomy. METHODS: One-hundred and seventeen consecutive patients, both genders, age 18-85, undergoing lobectomy for lung cancer between January 2013 and July 2015 were initially considered. Lobectomies were performed by the same surgical team, with thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) access. Exclusion criteria (n = 25 patients) were: previous KT exposure, recent trauma, pre-existing chest pain, lack of informed consent, >24-h postoperative intensive care unit treatment. After surgery, the 92 eligible patients were randomized to KT experimental group (n = 46) or placebo control group (n = 46). Standard postoperative analgesia was administered in both groups (paracetamol/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, epidural analgesia including opioids), with supplemental analgesia boluses at patient request. On postoperative day 1 in addition, in experimental group patients a specialized physiotherapist applied KT, with standardized tape length, tension and shape, over three defined skin areas: at the chest access site pain trigger point; over the ipsilateral deltoid/trapezius; lower anterior chest. In control group, usual dressing tape mimicking KT was applied over the same areas, as placebo. Thoracic pain severity score [visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging 0-10] was self-assessed by all patients on postoperative days 1, 2, 5, 8, 9 and 30. RESULTS: The KT group and the control group had similar demographics, lung cancer clinico-pathological features and thoracotomy/VATS ratio. Postoperatively, the two groups also resulted similar in supplemental analgesia, complication rate, mean duration of chest drainage and length of stay. There were no adverse events with KT application. After tape application, KT patients reported overall less thoracic pain than the control group, the difference being significant on postoperative day 5 [median VAS, 2 (interquartile range, 1-3) vs 3 (2-5), P < 0.01] and day 8 [median VAS, 1 (0-2) vs 2 (1-3), P < 0.05]. Moreover, on postoperative day 30 persistence of chest pain (VAS ≥3) was reported less frequently by the KT group than by the control group (7 vs 24%; P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: KT after lung lobectomy is a safe and effective auxiliary technique for chest pain control. ISRCTN REGISTRY: ISRCTN37253470.",

[Methods] All patients received treatment three times per week for four weeks. The kinesiology taping group had elastic tapes applied to the hamstring muscles, anterior tibialis, quadriceps femoris, and gastrocnemius. The range of motion was measured using joint goniometers, pain was measured using visual analog scales, and functional evaluation was conducted using the Korean Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. [Results] In intragroup comparisons of the kinesiology taping group and the conservative treatment group, the visual analog scale and Korean Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores significantly decreased, and the range of motion increased more than significantly. In intergroup comparisons, the kinesiology taping group showed significantly lower visual analog scale and Korean Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores and significantly larger ranges of motion than the conservative treatment group.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of kinesiology taping on fibularis longus latency time and postural sway in healthy subjects. METHODS: Thirty participants were equally randomized into three groups, two experimental groups receiving kinesiology tape (EG1, from origin to insertion; EG2, from insertion to origin) and a control group. Before and 20-min after the intervention, postural sway was assessed on a force platform and fibularis longus latency time was recorded with surface electromyography during a sudden inversion perturbation. RESULTS: At baseline, no differences were found between groups regarding age, anthropometrics variables, postural sway and fibularis longus latency time. In both experimental groups, the application of tape did not change postural sway and fibularis longus latency time (EG1: 93.7 ± 15.0 to 89.9 ± 15.6 ms; EG2, 81.24 ± 14.21 to 81.57 ± 16.64, p < 0.05).

This study was conducted to compare the effects of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching and modified anterior pelvic tilt taping (APTT) on hamstring shortness-associated pelvic compensation while executing seated double-knee extension. Male college students (28 healthy young adults; mean age: 21.4 ± 2.1 years) with hamstring shortness were recruited as study subjects and randomly assigned to either the PNF stretching group (control group) or the APTT group (experimental group). In all the subjects, changes in the movement distance of the centre of gluteal pressure (COGP) as well as rectus abdominis (RA) and semitendinosus (SEM) muscle activities were measured during seated double-knee extension while the respective intervention method was applied. Both groups showed significant decreases in COGP distance and RA muscle activity compared with their respective baseline values (p < 0.05), however, no significant changes were observed in SEM muscle activity. We can infer that not only a direct intervention on the hamstring, such as PNF stretching, but also a modified APTT-mediated pelvic intervention may be used as a method for reducing pelvic compensation induced by hamstring shortness."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Kinesiology tape (KT) has become popular among athletes for both injury prevention and rehabilitation due to its reported therapeutic effects, including facilitation of lymphatic flow and enhanced peripheral blood flow. However, evidence to support such claims is insufficient. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether KT improves skin blood flow (SkBF) responses in young, elite soccer players. DESIGN: Randomized crossover study. SETTING: Research laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen healthy, elite, adolescent male soccer players (age = 14.7 ± 0.6 years). INTERVENTION(S): Participants completed 2 experimental trials; during trial 1, the volar aspect of the dominant forearm was taped. Forearm SkBF was measured within the taped area and 3 cm lateral to the taped area. During trial 2, no tape was applied to either site. Both trials were performed within 7 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Baseline and maximal thermally (42°C) stimulated SkBF responses were assessed using laser Doppler flowmetry. Continuously measured SkBF and derived mean arterial pressure obtained at 5-minute intervals were used to calculate cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC), the primary outcome measure. RESULTS: No differences were observed for baseline SkBF or CVC between trials or measurement sites. After local heating, no differences were evident for SkBF or CVC between trials or measurement sites. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that, in healthy, trained adolescent males, KT was not associated with increased forearm SkBF.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Secondary lymphedema affects approximately 40% of women treated for breast cancer and is recognized as a major problem associated with the therapy of malignant tumors. Consequently, new therapeutic methods are constantly being sought to effectively eliminate the condition. One of the new forms of edema management, especially in the initial stages of edematous development, is Kinesiology Taping (KT). AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study was to assess the effects of KT applications on the extent of lymphedema of the upper extremity in women post cancer treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 28 women after axillary lymphadenectomy due to breast cancer. All the patients were diagnosed with grade I secondary lymphedema. Kinesiology Taping was applied to a total of 14 randomly selected women. The remaining 14 patients constituted a control group. The extent of lymphedema was measured using a centimeter tape and Limb Volumes Professional 5.0 software. RESULTS: A significant reduction in the extent of lymphedema (p = 0.0009) was achieved in the KT group between baseline and post-treatment assessments. No such reduction, however, was found in the control group (p = 0.36). CONCLUSIONS: Kinesiology Taping applications are an effective method of early-stage edema management. Kinesiology Taping may be a safe new therapeutic option in patients who are contraindicated for the use of other methods."

The purpose of this cross-sectional single-blind study was to investigate the immediate effects of Kinesiology taping of quadriceps on motor performance after muscle fatigued induction. Design. Randomized controlled cross-sectional design. Subjects. Forty-five subjects participated in this study. Participants were divided into three groups: Kinesiology taping group, placebo taping group, and nontaping group. Methods. Subjects performed short-term exercise for muscle fatigued induction, followed by the application of each intervention. Peak torque test, one-leg single hop test, active joint position sense test, and one-leg static balance test were carried out before and after the intervention. Results. Peak torque and single-leg hopping distance were significantly increased when Kinesiology taping was applied (p < 0.05). But there were no significant effects on active joint position sense and single-leg static balance. Conclusions. We proved that Kinesiology taping is effective in restoring muscle power reduced after muscle fatigued induction. Therefore, we suggest that Kinesiology taping is beneficial for fatigued muscles."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In an era of ubiquitous computing, a considerable part of the population, regardless of age group, spend more time in a sitting position. Long-term, static loading of the spine increases muscle tension, leading to the occurrence of pain. Physiotherapy is recommended as primary and secondary prevention of spinal pain symptoms. The Kinesiology Taping Method is one of the many special methods of physiotherapy which is used during the episodes of back pain in the lumbosacral region. This method consists in sticking on a special tape, which is made of stretch cotton similar to human skin, using a variety of techniques for patch application. The present study evaluated the effect of the application of the Kinesiology Taping technique for muscle mobility in the lumbar spine and the subjective perception of pain intensity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 100 patients (89 women and 11 men) who experienced pain in the lumbar spine. To assess the mobility of the lumbar spine the Schober test was used. The subjective sensation of pain was assessed using the VAS (visual analogue scale). Measurements were taken four times: before gluing applications, immediately after taping, 7 days after application of the patch, and immediately after its removal. RESULTS: In response to the use of therapy, an increase of mobility of the lumbar spine in flexion front and back, and reduced pain was shown. CONCLUSIONS: Application of the muscle kinesiology taping technique is an effective method in reducing pain and increasing mobility of the lumbar spine.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) most frequently affects smaller joints in the hands and feet. Among the most common deformations resulting from the progression of the disease are ulnar deviation, Boutonniere deformity, swan neck deformity, contractures and limited range of movement in the hand and wrist joints, muscular atrophy of long and short muscles. The topic of this article is the influence of using Kinesiology Taping method on the functioning of the hand of the patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The research involved 20 patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (16 women, 4 men), treated in the Hospital in Kup. Average age of patients was 62.2. Research subjects, apart from pharmacological treatment in the hospital ward, received standard physiotherapy. In case of 10 patients additional K-Active Tape applications were used to correct ulnar positioning of the hand and improve hand functioning. Prior to physiotherapy, all patients were given a hand functioning test and a dynamometer measurement was made. The tests were repeated after the 2-week rehabilitation process has been completed. The results were subjected to statistical analysis with the use of the Wilcoxon test and the U Mann-Whitney test. The assessment of the correlation between analysed parameters was made with the use of linear correlation test. RESULT: In the group where Kinesiology Tape applications were used, hand muscle strength increased significantly (p<0.05) in comparison with the group treated with standard physiotherapy. Hand muscle strength increase correlated with the tempo of carrying out the hand functioning test (r>0.8). CONCLUSION: Results suggest Kinesiology Taping method useful for physiotherapy of rheumatoid hand.",

New treatment methods are being sought, and Kinesiology Taping is one of them. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study involved 24 patients of both sexes subjected to lower limb lengthening using the Ilizarov method who had developed edema of the thigh or crus of the lengthened extremity. The mean age of the patients was 21 years. The patients were randomized into two groups of twelve, which were then subjected to 10 days of standard physiotherapy. The study group was additionally treated with Kinesiology Taping (lymphatic application), while the control group received standard lymphatic drainage. Treatment results were assessed by comparing the linear circumferences of the lower limbs before and after the treatment. RESULTS: The application of Kinesiology Taping in the study group produced a decrease in the circumference of the thigh and crus statistically more significant than that following lymphatic drainage. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Both standard edema-reducing treatment in the form of lymphatic massage and Kinesiology Taping significantly reduced lower limb edema in patients treated by the Ilizarov method. 2. The application of Kinesiology Taping in the study group produced a significantly faster reduction of the edema compared to standard lymphatic massage.",
