      "abstract": "Adults with severe intellectual and developmental disabilities who are beginning communicators can benefit from augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) intervention. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the efficacy of just-in-time programming of visual scene displays during ongoing interactions in an AAC intervention with adults who were beginning communicators. A single subject multiple probe design across four adult participants (ages 29-48) was used to evaluate the intervention. The intervention consisted of the creation of visual scene displays on a tablet computer while engaging the participants with songs, books, and games using just-in-time programming during the activities. Participants completed a minimum of five baseline and five intervention sessions. All participants demonstrated an increase in intentional and conventional communication turns during social interaction when the intervention was implemented. None of the participants discontinued using other intentional and conventional communication modes upon introduction to the tablet system. This intervention approach holds promise for adults with severe disabilities who remain at a beginning communicator level in young and middle adulthood. It is never too late for AAC intervention for any individual."

      "abstract": "Purpose Social interaction poses many challenges for adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and complex communication needs. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of video visual scene displays (video VSDs) on communication during interactions between adolescents with ASD and peer partners. Method This study used an across-participant multiple-baseline single-case experimental design. Four adolescents with ASD and complex communication needs were taught to use video VSDs, presented on a tablet-based app, during social interactions with peer partners in a high school setting. The video VSDs used during the interactions were selected (and programmed with vocabulary) based on the interests of the adolescent with ASD and their peer partner. Results Following the introduction of the video VSD intervention, all four adolescents with ASD demonstrated an increase in communicative turns compared to baseline (Tau-U= 1.0, 95% CI [0.56, 1]), and all four increased in modes of communication used. Increased use of speech also was observed for the three participants who made use of speech prior to the intervention. All participants with ASD (and their peer partners) expressed an interest in continued use of the video VSD app to support social interaction. Conclusion The use of video VSDs may be a viable option to increase the participation and communication of adolescents with ASD during social interactions with peer partners.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the Transition to Literacy (T2L) feature within video visual scene displays (VSDs) on the single-word reading of academic vocabulary concepts (i.e., weather concepts) by a pre-literate adolescent with cerebral palsy and minimal speech. METHOD: A single-subject, multiple probe, across word sets design was used to evaluate the effects of the intervention. The intervention used an AAC app programmed with video VSDs embedded with hotspots with the T2L feature to teach the adolescent 12 academic vocabulary words. RESULTS: The adolescent acquired all target words successfully with only minimal exposure to the written words through the app and was able to generalize her learning to two novel tasks. Using Tau-U to evaluate the size of the observed effects, there were very large effects across all word sets. CONCLUSION: The findings from this study demonstrate the effectiveness of the T2L feature to improve single-word reading in pre-literate individuals with minimal speech. The use of video VSDs and T2L technology together may offer professionals a unique way to complement current AAC devices and literacy instruction for adolescents with minimal speech who are pre-literate."

      "abstract": "Volunteer activities can provide opportunities to learn new skills, build social networks, and contribute to enhanced self-esteem. Volunteering also provides a positive contribution to society, and an opportunity to participate in activities that may differ from those in paid employment. People with severe disabilities and complex communication needs, however, may face significant barriers in participating and communicating in volunteer activities. A multiple-probe-across-participants, single-case experimental design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of videos with integrated visual scene displays (video VSDs). The video VSDs were presented using a tablet-based augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) app, as an intervention to increase the percent of steps completed independently within a volunteer activity. Participants were four adolescents with autism spectrum disorder or Down syndrome, all of whom had complex communication needs. Each participant met the mastery criterion for the activity - completion of the volunteer work activities and communication exchanges with co-volunteers - with the use of the video VSDs. The results provide preliminary evidence that video VSDs may be an effective assistive technology for individuals with severe disabilities and complex communication needs to increase participation in volunteer activities, both as an instructional support in learning new skills, and as an AAC technique to support interaction with others.",

The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the effect of an intervention package, consisting of tablet-based augmentative and alternative communication technology with video visual scene displays (video VSDs) and instruction, on communication between a child with ASD and a peer with typical development across three play activities. One dyad, consisting of the child with ASD and the peer, participated in this study. A multiple probe design across three play activities was used to evaluate the effect of the intervention on the number of symbolic communicative turns taken by the participant with ASD. At baseline, this participant demonstrated minimal symbolic communication related to play activities. Following the intervention, he demonstrated an increase in symbolic communicative turns across all three play activities, with a large overall effect size. The results of this study provide preliminary support for use of a video VSD intervention to support communication for children with ASD and limited speech during pretend play with their peers.",

      "abstract": "Purpose Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) is an intervention approach that can promote communication and language in children with multiple disabilities who are beginning communicators. While a wide range of AAC technologies are available, little is known about the comparative effects of specific technology options. Given that engagement can be low for beginning communicators with multiple disabilities, the current study provides initial information about the comparative effects of 2 AAC technology options-high-tech visual scene displays (VSDs) and low-tech isolated picture symbols-on engagement. Method Three elementary-age beginning communicators with multiple disabilities participated. The study used a single-subject, alternating treatment design with each technology serving as a condition. Participants interacted with their school speech-language pathologists using each of the 2 technologies across 5 sessions in a block randomized order. Results According to visual analysis and nonoverlap of all pairs calculations, all 3 participants demonstrated more engagement with the high-tech VSDs than the low-tech isolated picture symbols as measured by their seconds of gaze toward each technology option. Despite the difference in engagement observed, there was no clear difference across the 2 conditions in engagement toward the communication partner or use of the AAC. Conclusions Clinicians can consider measuring engagement when evaluating AAC technology options for children with multiple disabilities and should consider evaluating high-tech VSDs as 1 technology option for them. Future research must explore the extent to which differences in engagement to particular AAC technologies result in differences in communication and language learning over time as might be expected.",

METHOD: Nine students ages 8-20 were engaged in interactive activities using an aided AAC system with visual scene displays (VSDs; concepts embedded within a photograph of a naturally occurring event), and \"just-in-time\" (JIT) programming (the capability to add new contexts \"on the fly\"). Effectiveness was evaluated using a single subject multiple probe across participants design. RESULTS: All participants demonstrated increases in symbolic communication turns upon introduction of the AAC technologies with VSDs using JIT technology. CONCLUSIONS: AAC with VSDs and JIT programming may be effective in increasing symbolic communication for students with severe developmental disability. The fast and easy creation of VSDs and hotspots to provide communication may be a valuable tool for interventionists.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Visual scene displays (VSDs) and just-in-time programming supports are augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) technology features with theoretical benefits for beginning communicators of all ages. The goal of the current study was to evaluate the effects of a communication application (app) on mobile technology that supported the just-in-time programming of VSDs on the communication of preadolescents and adolescents who were beginning communicators. METHOD: A single-subject multiple-baseline across participant design was employed to evaluate the effect of the AAC app with VSDs programmed just-in-time by the researcher on the communication turns expressed by five preadolescents and adolescents (9-18 years old) who were beginning communicators. RESULT: All five participants demonstrated marked increases in the frequency of their communication turns after the onset intervention. CONCLUSION: Just-in-time programming support and VSDs are two features that may positively impact communication for beginning communicators in preadolescence and adolescence. Apps with these features allow partners to quickly and easily capture photos of meaningful and motivating events and provide them immediately as VSDs with relevant vocabulary to support communication in response to beginning communicators' interests.",

      "abstract": "Aided augmentative and alternative (AAC) interventions have been demonstrated to facilitate a variety of communication outcomes in persons with intellectual disabilities. Most aided AAC systems rely on a visual modality. When the medium for communication is visual, it seems likely that the effectiveness of intervention depends in part on the effectiveness and efficiency with which the information presented in the display can be perceived, identified, and extracted by communicators and their partners. Understanding of visual-cognitive processing - that is, how a user attends, perceives, and makes sense of the visual information on the display - therefore seems critical to designing effective aided AAC interventions. In this Forum Note, we discuss characteristics of one particular type of aided AAC display, that is, Visual Scene Displays (VSDs) as they may relate to user visual and cognitive processing. We consider three specific ways in which bodies of knowledge drawn from the visual cognitive sciences may be relevant to the composition of VSDs, with the understanding the direct research with children with complex communication needs is necessary to verify or refute our speculations.",
