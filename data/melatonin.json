      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The current literature lacks the effect of melatonin loaded nanoparticles (LNPs) as local drug delivery (LDD) in the treatment of periodontitis. Hence, the aim of the current study is to investigate the clinical and radiographic effects of melatonin LNPs in patients with periodontal intrabony defects. METHODS: The current study was performed on healthy patients with periodontal intrabony defects. The participants were randomly allocated into 3 groups. Group 1 received scaling and root planing (SRP) with melatonin LNPs, group 2 received placebo gel with SRP, and group 3 received SRP and chitosan LNPs. The primary outcomes included the radiographic measurements of the bone defects to evaluate the bone fill after 6 months. The secondary outcomes included the following clinical parameters; clinical attachment level (CAL), periodontal probing depth (PPD), plaque index (PI), and gingival index (GI). The clinical parameters were evaluated at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. RESULTS: The current study included 67 patients with periodontal intrabony defects. All the study groups demonstrated significant improvements in all the clinical outcomes (CAL, PPD, PI, and GI) (P < 0.05). Melatonin LNPs group revealed the most significant improvement of the radiographic outcomes after 6 months including bone defect height and depth, alveolar crest level, and the buccolingual and mesiodistal width of bone defects) (P < 0.05), followed by chitosan group while insignificant changes were detected in the placebo group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Melatonin LNPs as a LDD can act as a promising therapeutic modality in treating periodontal intrabony defects through significant improvement of the clinical and radiographic outcomes."

      "abstract": "This study aims to assess the efficacy of melatonin in mitigating the adverse effects of hypobaric hypoxia on the cardiovascular system of neonatal lambs (30 days old). Two groups were considered for this purpose: (i) Melatonin-treated group (N = 5) and (ii) Control group (N = 6) without treatment. All subjects were exposed to hypobaric hypoxia during gestation and perinatal periods, with melatonin administered after birth. The study focused on the carotid artery, a known predictor of cardiovascular risk. Biomechanical tests, morphometric, and histological measurements were conducted, and a numerical model was developed based on the biomechanical data. Key findings showed remodeling effects: Firstly, a realignment of collagen fibers towards a longitudinal direction was observed with melatonin treatment, similar to non-hypoxic arteries. Second, changes in residual stress and ex-vivo luminal radius were noted, aiming to reduce wall stress and increase vascular resistance. These changes indicate an antihypertensive response, reducing the effects of increased blood pressure and flow due to hypobaric hypoxia. This study demonstrates that biomechanical and histomorphometric methodologies effectively assess the beneficial effects of melatonin treatment under hypobaric hypoxia exposure."

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Preserving health-related quality of life is an aspect of care that requires constant attention from the time of cancer diagnosis. Melatonin has been used to diminish treatment-related side effects and cancer symptoms, and as a medication to regulate circadian rhythm. An up-to-date systematic review is needed to investigate the current evidence concerning possible beneficial effects of melatonin on quality of life and sleep in cancer patients. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the benefits and harms of melatonin for preserving health-related quality of life and sleep in cancer patients. SEARCH METHODS: To identify studies for inclusion in this review, we used CENTRAL, MEDLINE, 10 other databases, and four trial registers, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors. The latest search date was 10 September 2024. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults (18 years or over) with histologically proven cancer of any stage that evaluated melatonin (alone or in combination with standard anticancer treatment) versus no treatment or placebo (alone or in combination with standard anticancer treatment), or standard anticancer treatment. Standard anticancer treatment refers to treatments to stop or prevent cancer, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, immunotherapy, and hormonal therapies (such as androgen deprivation therapy). OUTCOMES: The primary outcomes of interest were quality of life and sleep quality within three months, and melatonin-related adverse events. Other outcomes included survival, disease-free survival, progression-free survival, tumour response, and anticancer treatment-related harms. RISK OF BIAS: We used Cochrane's risk of bias tool (RoB 1) to assess the risk of bias in the studies included in the review. SYNTHESIS METHODS: We synthesised results for each outcome using random-effects meta-analysis. The effect size was presented as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). If this was not possible, due to the nature of the data, we synthesised results in a narrative format. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. INCLUDED STUDIES: We identified 30 RCTs (reported in 49 publications) involving 5093 adult participants with cancer (2470 males, 2228 females, 395 not reported). Studies were conducted in a hospital setting and took place in at least 10 countries. We assessed two studies at low risk of bias and the other 28 at high risk of bias. SYNTHESIS OF RESULTS: Melatonin plus standard treatment versus placebo plus standard treatment The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of melatonin on quality of life score (MD 2.60, 95% CI -14.53 to 19.73; 1 study, 126 participants; very low certainty evidence), and sleep score (MD 2.80, 95% CI 0.18 to 5.42; 1 study, 50 participants; very low certainty evidence) within three months. We are also very uncertain about potential adverse effects of melatonin: headache (RR 2.77, 95% CI 0.33 to 23.14; 1 study, 25 participants; very low certainty evidence); fatigue (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.17; 2 studies, 170 participants; very low certainty evidence); and nausea (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.56; 1 study, 146 participants; very low certainty evidence). No data are available relating to dizziness. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because of high risk of bias, small sample size, the width of the 95% confidence interval, and indirectness due to inadequate reporting of cancer type. Melatonin plus standard treatment versus standard treatment No data are available relating to quality of life and sleep within three months. The evidence is very uncertain about headaches (experienced by 15 of 820 participants in melatonin groups, with no data available for control groups; 2 studies, 1640 participants; very low certainty evidence). Melatonin likely reduces the incidence of fatigue (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.55; 10 studies, 1359 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and may reduce nausea (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.00; 6 studies, 710 participants; low-certainty evidence). No data are available relating to dizziness. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because of the high risk of bias and the width of the 95% confidence interval. Melatonin (topical use) plus standard treatment versus placebo plus standard treatment The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of melatonin on quality of life (one study reported no difference between groups, both having the same median score of 66.7; 48 participants; very low certainty evidence). No data are available relating to sleep and adverse events (including headache, dizziness, fatigue, and nausea). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because of the high risk of bias, small sample size, and insufficient data. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence is of very low certainty, so we are unable to draw conclusions about the effects of melatonin on quality of life and sleep at three months in people receiving treatment for cancer. There may be no difference in adverse events between melatonin plus standard treatment and placebo plus standard treatment, but the evidence is very uncertain. Data were lacking for some outcomes, such as dizziness. Melatonin used alongside standard treatment probably reduces the risk of fatigue and may reduce nausea when compared to standard treatment alone. Since the evidence base for melatonin in people with cancer is limited due to insufficient data and risks of bias in study design, the decision for or against using melatonin as an adjunct to cancer treatment cannot easily be made at the current time.

      "abstract": "The beneficial role of melatonin (MT) as a potent broad-spectrum antioxidant and hormone-like regulator in plant protection against adverse environmental conditions is indisputable. However, the molecular networks underlying its unique scavenging capabilities are still far from understood. Herein, we show the ability of MT to maintain physiological functions under high light stress (HL) is mediated by photoreceptors. Melatonin treatment (50 μM) of the photoreceptor mutants phyA/B and cry1/2 augmented the deleterious effects of excess light (600 μmol m-2 s-1, 24 h), as evidenced by increased TBARs levels and electrolyte leakage, as well as decreased photosynthetic efficiency, in contrast to their parental form, Landsberg erecta, in which these parameters were significantly improved. The reduced stress resistance of the mutants was also confirmed by analysis of the transcript accumulation of ROS markers and enzymatic scavengers. Moreover, the increase in melatonin content in the mutants exposed to HL + MT contributed to increased ROS accumulation; therefore, the deleterious effect of MT could not be explained by an imbalance in ROS production below the cytostatic level. We hypothesize that the light-sensitive phenotypes of photoreceptor mutants under MT treatment may be due to the misregulation of stress-related genes that are targets for melatonin action."

      "abstract": "Plants have evolved a series of complicated defense mechanisms to counteract pathogen invasions. Although many studies have provided molecular evidence of resistance proteins and downstream signal transduction networks, the mechanisms by which plants resist pathogens remain poorly understood at the metabolite level. Here, we performed transcriptomic analyses of wheat leaves infected with Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), the causal agent of wheat stripe rust. Functional enrichment analysis of identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed the strongest resistance responses at 24 h post-inoculation (hpi) in the incompatible wheat-Pst interaction system. Integrated with the metabolomics data at 24 hpi, we found that the amino acid metabolic pathways appeared to be directly involved in stripe rust resistance. Among these, five differentially abundant metabolites (DAMs) indole, tryptophan, tryptamine, N-Methylserotonin, and 5-Methoxyindoleacetate were enriched to the biosynthesis pathway of melatonin, a branch of tryptophan metabolism. Subsequent UPLC-MS/MS analysis confirmed that melatonin was highly accumulated in the incompatible wheat-Pst system, but not in the compatible interaction system. Exogenous melatonin treatment induced wheat resistance to Pst. The most significantly upregulated melatonin biosynthesis-related gene in the incompatible wheat-Pst system was TaASMT3, which encodes an acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase. Virus-induced gene silencing analysis revealed that knocking down TaASMT3 reduced wheat resistance to stripe rust, further suggesting a positive role of melatonin in wheat resistance to Pst. Taken together, these data suggest that melatonin was accumulated during Pst infection to activate wheat defense responses, offering a new perspective for elucidation of wheat stripe rust resistance based on metabolic dynamics.",

      "abstract": "Chronic sleep restriction (SR) impairs the glymphatic clearance of macromolecular toxic metabolites, which is associated with the loss of perivascular polarization of aquaporin-4 (AQP4). Melatonin (Mel) has been shown to maintain the circadian rhythm of AQP4 polarization. However, the role of AQP4 polarization in Mel's protective effects against SR-induced brain dysfunction remains unclear. In the present study, using a modified rotating rod SR mouse model, we demonstrated the time-dependent effect of SR on short-term memory deficits and AQP4 mislocalization in the hippocampus. Subsequent experiments characterized the dose-dependent pattern of Mel ameliorating SR-induced impairments of cognitive function and AQP4 polarity. Mel's treatment enhanced glymphatic transport in SR mice, as revealed by cerebrospinal tracer experiments, and reduced hippocampal amyloid-beta and phosphorylated tau levels. Additionally, Mel significantly decreased glial cell activation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and synaptic protein loss in the hippocampus of SR mice. However, in AQP4 knockout mice, Mel's protective effects against SR-induced pathophysiological alterations described above were largely abolished. Mechanistically, Mel activated the vitamin D receptor and then upregulated expression of DTNA (Dystrobrevin Alpha), a key component of the dystrophin-associated complex, which in turn restored AQP4 polarization during chronic SR conditions. This finding indicates that AQP4-mediated lymphatic clearance is necessary for Mel to combat chronic SR-induced brain impairment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbances are common in Parkinson's disease (PD), significantly impacting quality of life. Melatonin may help, but evidence regarding dosage, formulation, and treatment duration remains inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: To quantitatively analyze the effect of melatonin on sleep quality and daytime sleepiness in patients with PD. METHODS: We comprehensively searched multiple databases up to February 2025, selecting relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). RevMan software was used for analysis. Subgroup analyses included treatment duration (4 weeks vs. 8-12 weeks), dose (≤4 mg vs. >4 mg), and formulation (immediate-release vs. prolonged-release). RESULTS: Five RCTs (206 patients) were included. Doses ≤4 mg showed no significant improvement in total Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores (MD = -1.26, 95 % CI: -2.72 to 0.20). Doses >4 mg demonstrated a stronger effect (MD = -2.90, 95 % CI: -4.02 to -1.78). Short-term use (4 weeks) significantly improved PSQI scores (MD = -2.43, 95 % CI: -3.98 to -0.88), whereas longer treatment (8-12 weeks) showed a non-significant effect (MD = -1.24, 95 % CI: -3.15 to 0.67). Immediate-release formulations significantly improved PSQI scores (MD = -2.20, 95 % CI: -3.32 to -1.08), while prolonged-release formulations showed no significant effect (MD = -0.61, 95 % CI: -4.15 to 2.93). Melatonin modestly reduced excessive daytime sleepiness measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) (MD: -0.97, 95 % CI: -1.81, -0.14). CONCLUSION: Melatonin may improve sleep quality and reduce daytime sleepiness in PD patients, particularly with short-term use of immediate-release formulations."

      "abstract": "Prostate cancer frequently progresses to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) following androgen deprivation therapy, presenting a significant clinical challenge. Targeting tumor metabolism, particularly mitochondrial pathways, offers a promising strategy for overcoming CRPC. The modification of melatonin (Mel) to a triphenylphosphonium (TPP) cation-targeted mitochondria-melatonin (Mito-Mel) significantly increases its potency by over 1000-fold. Mito-Mel selectively targets mitochondria, enhancing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and causing mitochondrial membrane potential disruption. This leads to the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration including the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which, in turn, suppresses CRPC survival metabolic adaptations, such as glycolysis. In vitro and in vivo experiments reveal for the first time that natural small molecule compound with mitochondrial targeting via TPP exhibits excellent anticancer efficacy by inducing tumor cellular pyroptosis and facilitating the immune response, underlining the encouraging promise of this strategy for the effective treatment of CRPC."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aging is accompanied by impairments in stimulus recognition, and decreased melatonin levels have been shown in aged mice and humans. These age-related changes are associated with an increased risk of neurological diseases. In the present study, our aim is to investigate whether melatonin supplementation could ameliorate age-related cognitive decline in aged mice. METHODS: Mice were treated with melatonin or saline. The novel object recognition (NOR) task was used to provide a simultaneous assessment of object and object location memory, which is a component of episodic-like memory. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage was assessed using an Immunoglobulin G (IgG) leakage assay. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses were employed to investigate changes in protein levels. RESULTS: We demonstrate that aging impairs memory in the NOR task, with concomitant decreases in the levels of synaptophysin (SYP), CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1), and phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) levels within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. Moreover, alongside compromised BBB integrity, aging results in the degradation of occludin in both the PFC and hippocampus. Our findings demonstrate that aging impairs memory performance in the NOR task, accompanied by reductions in SYP, CRTC1, and p-AMPK levels within the PFC and hippocampus. Furthermore, alongside compromised BBB integrity, aging results in the degradation of occludin in both the PFC and hippocampus. More importantly, PDZ and LIM domain 5 (Pldim5) was upregulated in melatonin-treated mice, and aging-related memory impairment in the NOR task was significantly reduced in Pdlim5-/- mice. Notably, 1 week of melatonin (10 mg/kg) treatment significantly improved memory, along with enhanced BBB integrity, Pdlim5 downregulation, and CRTC1 and p-AMPK upregulation. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings suggest that melatonin ameliorates aging-related memory decline in the NOR task by downregulating Pdlim5, maintaining BBB integrity, and upregulating CRTC1 and p-AMPK in aged mice.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The egg-laying performance of hens is primarily regulated by ovarian follicle growth and development; these follicles are susceptible to oxidative damage caused by excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oxidative damage can lead to follicular atresia and impaired reproductive performance. Melatonin (MT), a known endogenous antioxidant, plays a role in regulating oxidative damage, but its precise mechanisms in mitigating H2O2-induced oxidative damage via mitophagy regulation in granulosa cells remain unclear. METHODS: An in vitro oxidative damage model was established by determining the optimal H2O2 concentration using CCK-8 fluorescence quantification. The optimal MT concentration was identified through fluorescence quantification and catalase (CAT) activity assays. The protective effects of MT against H2O2-induced oxidative damage in follicular granulosa cells were investigated using flow cytometry, Western blotting, ELISA, and quantitative fluorescence analysis. RESULTS: An in vitro oxidative damage model was established using H2O2-induced granulosa cells, characterized by P53 and LC3-II upregulation and LC3-I and BCL-2 downregulation. The optimal MT concentration for reducing cellular injury was determined. MT co-treatment enhanced CAT, GSH, and SOD activities, decreased LC3-II/LC3-I conversion, and increased P62 expression. Furthermore, MT reduced autophagic vesicle formation and restored mitochondrial membrane potential, demonstrating its protective effect against H2O2-induced oxidative damage. CONCLUSIONS: Melatonin alleviates H2O2-induced oxidative damage in chicken follicular granulosa cells by modulating antioxidant defense, autophagy, and mitochondrial function. These findings provide newer insights to our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying the alleviation of the H2O2-induced oxidative damage in granulosa cells during ovarian follicle development in chickens.",

      "abstract": "Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the destruction of tooth-supporting structures, influenced by immune system dysregulation, oxidative stress, and imbalances in bone metabolism. Given its multifactorial pathogenesis, bioactive compounds such as vitamin D, melatonin, and omega-3 fatty acids have emerged as potential adjuncts to periodontal therapy due to their immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative properties. This narrative review explores the role of these three supplements in periodontal health, their potential in synergistic effects, and existing research gaps, providing a foundation for future studies on their clinical applications. Vitamin D is essential for calcium homeostasis, bone remodeling, and immune function. It modulates both innate and adaptive immune responses, enhancing antimicrobial peptide production and reducing inflammatory cytokine expression. Omega-3 fatty acids reduce the production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids while promoting the synthesis of pro-resolving lipid mediators, contributing to bone preservation and immune balance. Melatonin, known for its antioxidant and osteogenic properties, supports bone remodeling by stimulating osteoblast proliferation and inhibiting osteoclast activity, while also regulating circadian rhythms, which may influence oral health. Although these bioactive compounds show promising effects in preclinical and clinical studies, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding optimal dosages, long-term efficacy, combined use, and standardized treatment protocols. Further clinical trials are necessary to elucidate their therapeutic value in periodontal disease management, especially those focused on their potential synergistic mechanisms. Understanding their synergistic mechanisms may open new avenues for adjunctive strategies in periodontal therapy."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Migraines are neurological disorders which significantly impact quality of life. Current pharmacological treatments often have adverse effects, prompting the search for alternatives with fewer side effects. Several studies have described the antimigraine properties of palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and melatonin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our research assessed the efficacy of the association of hydrodispersible PEA (1,200 mg) and melatonin (0.2 mg) by a randomized, three-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (PEATONIDE®; n = 30 patients; placebo; n = 30 patients). The participants were recruited by \"I.N.B.B. Consortium\" in Italy. The primary outcome was the reduction of migraine frequency, while secondary outcomes included the reduction of intensity, duration, and grade of disability. The parameters were assessed by a self-reported daily headache diary. RESULTS: The formulation displayed a significant reduction in frequency (T3 months: 2.2 ± 0.4 MMDs; T0 baseline: 3.4 ± 0.5 MMDs, ***p < 0.001 vs baseline T0) and duration, intensity, disability, and incidence of associated symptoms of migraine attacks after 3 months of treatment. No adverse effects were observed during the treatment. In addition, a significant mitigation of migraine-related symptomatology was observed. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that PEATONIDE® may be a promising adjunctive approach for migraine management. However, given the relatively small sample size, further large-scale and multicenter trials are needed to confirm its clinical applicability in broader migraine population."

Forty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 6 groups (n = 8): CT: control, VEH: sciatic nerve injury, LMP: 15-mg/kg methylprednisolone, high-dose methylprednisolone (HMP): 30-mg/kg methylprednisolone, MEL: 15-mg/kg melatonin, MMP: 15-mg/kg methylprednisolone+15-mg/kg melatonin. The rats were evaluated with Sciatic Functional Index (SFI), nerve conduction study, interleukin-1β (IL-1ß), nerve growth factor (NGF), total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS) and histopathological scores. There were no significant intergroup differences in baseline tests. SFI significantly improved in all treated groups with no significant intergroup differences. Motor amplitude improved most in MMP, LMP and MEL, respectively. Nerve conduction velocity significantly improved in MMP compared to VEH. There were no significant intergroup differences regarding serum NGF, TAS and TOS. Tissue NGF levels were higher in LMP, HMP and MEL. IL-1ß levels were significantly lower in CT and MMP. Tissue oxidative stress levels were significantly lower in treated groups compared to VEH, with no significant difference among them. MMP showed greater histopathological improvement. Melatonin combination therapy in sciatic nerve crush injury provided adequate functional improvement, superior electrophysiological and histopathological recovery compared to high-dose methylprednisolone and exhibited better anti-inflammatory activity through IL-1ß.",

      "abstract": "The interaction between ethylene and melatonin in the regulation of polyphenol metabolism and the underlying mechanism remain largely unclear. This work demonstrated that ethylene treatment increased melatonin biosynthesis by inducing the VvASMT expression in grape seeds. Ethylene-induced VvERF5 transactivated VvASMT via binding to the ethylene response element in its promoter. VvERF5 overexpression led to an increase in melatonin biosynthesis while its suppression generated the opposite results in grape seeds, calli, and/or Arabidopsis seeds. A melatonin-responsive element (MTRE) was identified, and melatonin-induced VvERF104 was found to bind to the MTRE of the VvMYB14 promoter and activate its expression. VvMYB14 overexpression widely modified the expression of genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway and phenolic compound content in grape seeds. DNA affinity purification sequencing revealed that the MEME-1 motif was the most likely binding sites of VvMYB14. VvPAL, VvC4H, and VvCHS were verified to be the target genes of VvMYB14. Additionally, the overexpression of VvERF5 or VvERF104 increased the expression of VvPAL, VvC4H, and VvCHS, as well as the levels of the corresponding metabolites. Moreover, the roles of VvERF5, VvASMT, and VvERF104 in mediating ethylene-induced changes in the phenylpropanoid pathway were elucidated using their suppressing seeds. Collectively, ethylene increased the VvMYB14 expression via the pathway of ERF5-melatonin-ERF104 and thereby modified the phenylpropanoid pathway."

      "abstract": "Melatonin is used as an adjuvant therapy in cancer treatment. However, its effectiveness is limited because of its low bioavailability. Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) made of chitosan and lecithin have been developed to overcome this limitation and optimize localized drug delivery. These lecithin and chitosan-based NPs loaded with melatonin (NP-MEL) were evaluated for their cytotoxic potential in metastatic breast cancer cells and their safety profile in a murine model. Physicochemical characterization revealed efficient melatonin encapsulation (31 %), a positive zeta potential (48.6 mV), and controlled release at physiological pH. NP-MEL exhibited selective cytotoxicity in vitro, with a toxic concentration capable of killing 50 % of the cells (CC50) of 109.53 μg/mL for 4 T1 cancer cells and a significantly higher CC50 of 1460.59 μg/mL for normal VERO cells, resulting in a selectivity index of 13.33. In vivo experiments with BALB/c mice with tumor implantation treated with NP-MEL (2 mg/kg/day for 21 days) showed no significant changes in weight, clinical signs, or biochemical markers of liver and kidney function, except for changes in gamma-glutamyl transferase levels. Histopathological analyses confirmed the preservation of the liver and kidney architecture in the NP-MEL-treated group, in contrast to the moderate-to-severe kidney damage observed in animals treated with empty NPs. These findings highlight the low toxicity and therapeutic potential of NP-MEL as a controlled and targeted-release system for breast cancer treatment, indicating the need for further preclinical investigation."

This study evaluates melatonin's (MT) role in preserving ber fruit (cv. Umran) quality during cold storage. Physiologically mature fruit were treated with MT (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 μM) for 30 min at 24 ± 2 °C and stored for 28 days at 6.5 ± 1 °C with 85-90 % relative humidity. Control fruit were dipped in distilled water. Compared to control on the last day, MT (100 μM) significantly reduced ethylene evolution (28 %), respiration rate (19 %), minimized weight loss (40 %) and retained higher firmness (35 %). Treated fruit exhibited higher total soluble solids (19 %), glucose (15 %), fructose (25 %) and sucrose (16 %). MT (100 μM) also retained 51 % more ascorbic acid, 16 % higher total phenols, and 37 % greater titratable acidity while lower polyphenol oxidase activity by 24 %, mitigating peel browning. Antioxidant activity was 30 % higher and antioxidant enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and guaiacol peroxidase were sustained at higher levels in MT (100 μM) by 53 %, 51 %, and 131 %, respectively. Multivariate analysis confirmed MT's efficacy, with PCA explaining 85.2 % of variance in quality attributes and Pearson's correlation showing a strong positive relationship between postharvest quality and antioxidant system. These findings highlight MT (100 μM) as a promising phytohormonal treatment to extend ber fruit shelf life while maintaining nutritional and sensory quality, with potential commercial applications in postharvest management.",

Current treatment options for cancer include surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, nanomedicine, and immunotherapy. Recent experimental and clinical studies have provided substantial evidence supporting the potential use of melatonin as a preventive and therapeutic agent in oncology. Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxy-tryptamine), a pleiotropic and multitasking molecule, is secreted from the pineal gland during the night under normal light-dark conditions. Beyond its role in circadian regulation, melatonin exhibits antioxidant, anti-aging, immunomodulatory, and anti-cancer properties. Melatonin exerts significant apoptotic, angiogenic, oncostatic, and anti-proliferative effects on a variety of cancer cells. This review discusses the influence of melatonin on cancer cells through mechanisms involving cell cycle regulation, stimulation of apoptosis, autophagy induction, epigenetic modification, and transcriptional regulation."

Despite the plethora of pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions employed for anxiety management, their relative efficacy remains unclear. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of oral melatonin (6 mg) and music therapy in preoperative anxiety management among patients undergoing surgical extraction of impacted mandibular third molars. A total of 78 patients aged 18-40 years undergoing surgical extraction were selected and randomly assigned into three groups: nil intervention (Group NI) with no intervention, Group ML administered oral melatonin, and Group MT administered 20 min of relaxing music (n = 26). Physiological parameters (pulse rate, blood pressure) and subjective assessments (visual analogue scale for anxiety) were measured on arrival (T1), after the intervention (T2), and after surgical extraction (T3). Salivary cortisol levels, recorded preoperatively and postoperatively, were analysed using ELISA. Results showed significant improvement in physiological parameters for both ML and MT compared with NI (p < 0.05). However, postoperative cortisol levels increased significantly in the NI (0.55 (0.15) - 0.88 (0.32) pmol/ml) and MT groups (from 0.33 (0.15) - 0.62 (0.2) pmol/ml) but decreased in the ML group (from 0.42 (0.19) - 0.3 (0.14) pmol/ml). This indicated a delayed action of melatonin as compared with the immediate impact of music therapy. Understanding the mechanisms and insights obtained can aid in developing advanced anxiety management methods for dental practitioners, thereby enhancing patient care and outcomes in dental practice."

      "abstract": "Testicular heat stress is a critical factor contributing to male infertility, with spermatocytes exhibiting heightened sensitivity to temperature elevation. This study systematically elucidates the protective mechanisms of melatonin against heat stress-induced spermatocyte injury. In a murine heat stress model, melatonin intervention significantly reduced testicular accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA) induced by heat stress, enhanced the activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and suppressed germ cell apoptosis by downregulating the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and upregulating GPX4 expression. Sycp3 immunohistochemistry demonstrated that melatonin significantly improved spermatocyte structural integrity. In the GC-2spd (ts) spermatocyte cell line model, melatonin treatment markedly reduced MDA levels and alleviated heat stress-induced oxidative apoptosis and proliferation inhibition by downregulating key apoptotic proteins (Bax, Caspase3, and cleaved-Caspase3). Mechanistic studies revealed that melatonin restores autophagic balance by modulating the expression of autophagy-related proteins LC3-I, LC3-II, and P62. Concurrently, melatonin downregulated ferroptosis markers P53 and COX2, inhibiting ferroptosis by blocking DNA damage response and inflammatory amplification pathways. Melatonin synergistically maintained cellular redox homeostasis by downregulating the NRF2/HO-1 pathway and upregulating GPX4 expression, significantly reducing Fe²⁺ accumulation and ameliorating iron metabolism dysregulation. This study unveils the molecular mechanisms by which melatonin mitigates testicular heat stress injury through a multi-target regulatory network, providing novel therapeutic strategies for clinical intervention in heat stress-associated infertility."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hedonic eating, reward-driven eating rather than out of biological needs, has been proposed as one of the important causes of overweight and obesity in recent years. Dopamine, endocannabinoids, opioids, and ghrelin are among the physiological factors associated with hedonic eating. Since the results of some previous animal studies have indicated the effectiveness of melatonin supplementation on the levels of endocannabinoids, and ghrelin, therefore this pilot study will investigate the effect of melatonin supplementation on plasma levels of endocannabinoid 2-arachidonylglycerol, ghrelin, and the intensity of hedonic eating in overweight/obese females. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, forty-six women with overweight/obesity and high hedonic eating intensity (total score of power of food scale > 2.5) will be recruited. They will receive either a 5 mg/day melatonin supplement (n = 23) or a placebo (n = 23) for 8 weeks. The primary outcomes, including the plasma levels of 2-arachidonylglycerol and ghrelin, and the intensity of hedonic eating will be assessed at the baseline and end of the study. Additionally, the secondary outcomes (dietary intake, and body weight) will be evaluated at the study's onset, after four weeks, and upon completion of the intervention. A one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to detect the effect of melatonin supplementation on outcome variables. DISCUSSION: Considering the positive effects of melatonin supplementation in reducing endocannabinoid levels, the expression of the ghrelin hormone gene, the level of ghrelin, and the cannabinoid receptor type 1 gene expression in animal studies, it is possible that in human subjects, it could impact the intensity of hedonic eating by lowering endocannabinoid and ghrelin levels. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered with the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials in June 2023 under the ID number IRCT20080904001197N22.",

      "abstract": "Melatonin is one of the important endogenous signaling molecules for regulating plant growth and development, and various abiotic stress responses. UV-B is an intrinsic component of sunlight. Plants are particularly vulnerable to UV-B radiation compared to other abiotic stressors due to their sessile growth patterns. Previous studies reported that melatonin played a key role in Arabidopsis UV-B signaling responses and UV-B resistance. However, there are still few reports on the biological effects of melatonin in leguminous plants responses to UV-B. We have selected alfalfa pretreated with exogenous melatonin, coumarin, or 5-hydroxytryptamine as biological materials, and the interactive effects between melatonin metabolisms in plant and UV-B radiation will be investigated by testing hypocotyl elongation, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, physiochemical reaction, antioxidant defense, and its related gene expression. The results have showed that UV-B radiation significantly inhibited hypocotyl elongation, altered leaf phenotype and photosynthetic parameters, induced ROS levels and cell membrane damage, decreased antioxidant enzyme activities except for POD (Peroxidase), and downregulated related gene expression. However, exogenous melatonin efficiently repaired detrimental effects by UV-B radiation through activating antioxidant defense and enhancing photosynthetic efficiency. We have also found that 5-hydroxytryptamine treatment displayed the same biological effects via increasing endogenous melatonin. However, coumarin application had no obvious improvements.

This study aimed to explore the impact of melatonin (MT) treatment on the fruit quality of wolfberry stored at 4°C, using combined transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses. In this study, about 15% of the flavonoid metabolites differed significantly after MT treatment in yellow-fleshed wolfberry, especially for flavanols, flavanones, and flavonols. MT treatment enhanced esterified carotenoid content in red-fleshed wolfberry postharvest. Comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed that MT-induced upregulation of LbaF3'H, LbaHQT and LbaCHS1 might contribute to the increased flavonoids in yellow-flesh wolfberry, and that MT-induced upregulation of LbaPSY, LbaCRTISO and LbaCYCB are responsible for the increased carotenoids in red-flesh wolfberry. Coexpression network analysis showed that several transcription factors such as LbaGATA are involved in MT-mediated regulation of flavonoids and carotenoids. Dual luciferase assay evidenced that LbaGATA and LbaRKD5 depress the expression of LbaPSY. Overall, this study underscores MT's role in maintaining wolfberry postharvest quality during storage, providing a solid foundation of food application.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Sleep disorders in the insomnia spectrum, as well as nightmares, are among the most sensitive and persistent symptoms in children with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There is currently no reference treatment or specific pharmacological treatment recommendation on the management of sleep disturbances in children and adolescents suffering from PTSD, despite the fact that they have a significant effect on daytime functioning and overall mental health of children as well as on family's health and quality of life. In this respect, paediatric prolonged-release melatonin (PedPRM) has shown significant beneficial effects on insomnia disorders in children with autism spectrum disorders and positive effects on anxiety and depressive symptomatology. Our study will be the first randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of PedPRM melatonin on sleep disorders in children and adolescents with PTSD, as well as on PTSD symptoms, associated daytime functioning and overall mental health in these children and their caregivers.Methods/design: The MelatoSOM-Kids-PTSD study (French national hospital-based clinical research programme) will be a multi-centre prospective double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group clinical trial investigating the efficacy of paediatric prolonged-release melatonin to alleviate sleep disturbances in children and adolescents with PTSD (120 participants recruited over a 24-month period). The experimental group will be treated with active prolonged-release melatonin over 13 weeks (PedPRM). The control group will receive a placebo. The primary endpoint will be the difference in sleep diary derived total sleep time after 13 weeks of treatment in the PedPRM group versus placebo group. Secondary endpoints will be the differences in objective sleep quality parameters and daytime functioning before and after treatment, in children with PTSD and their caregivers.Discussion: This paper describes the MelatoSOM-Kids-PTSD protocol, which will evaluate the effectiveness of melatonin, a treatment that has already demonstrated an excellent benefit-risk ratio in the paediatric population over 4 years.",

      "abstract": "Sarcopenia, a condition associated with aging, involves progressive loss of muscle mass, strength, and function, leading to impaired mobility, health, and increased mortality. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear, which limits the development of effective therapeutic interventions. Emerging evidence implicates chronodisruption as a key contributor to sarcopenia, emphasizing the role of Bmal1, a circadian clock gene critical for muscle integrity and mitochondrial function. In a skeletal muscle-specific and inducible Bmal1 knockout model (iMS-Bmal1-/-), we observed hallmark features of sarcopenia, including disrupted rhythms, impaired muscle function, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Exercise and melatonin treatment reversed these deficits independently of Bmal1. Building on these findings, the present study elucidates several mechanisms underlying these changes and the pathways by which melatonin and exercise exert their beneficial effects. Our findings indicate that iMS-Bmal1-/- mice exhibit reduced expression of satellite cell and muscle regulatory factors, indicating impaired muscle regeneration. While mitochondrial respiration remained unchanged, notable alterations in mitochondrial dynamics disrupted mitochondria in skeletal muscle. In addition, these mice showed alterations in muscle energy metabolism, compromised antioxidant defense, and inflammatory response. Remarkably, exercise and/or melatonin successfully mitigated these deficits, restoring muscle health in Bmal1-deficient mice. These findings position exercise and melatonin as promising therapeutic candidates for combating sarcopenia and emphasize the need to elucidate the molecular pathways underlying their protective effects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiotoxicity is a serious adverse effect of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) a common chemotherapeutic agent. This study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of melatonin (MLT) against 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced cardiotoxicity in rats, focusing on oxidative stress, inflammatory pathways, gene expression, electrocardiographic and histopathological changes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five male Wistar rats were divided into five groups. The animals received either MLT at doses of 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day, 5-FU at 50 mg/kg (i.p.), or a combination of both treatments. Cardiotoxicity was assessed through electrocardiography, cardiac enzymes, oxidative stress markers, and histopathology. RESULTS: 5-FU treatment significantly increased oxidative stress markers and inflammatory mediators while causing histopathological damage in heart tissues. Co-administration of MLT with 5-FU significantly mitigated these effects by reducing oxidative damage, as evidenced by lower levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), and myeloperoxidase (MPO). Additionally, MLT enhanced antioxidant activity, as reflected by increased levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in heart tissues. Gene expression analysis further confirmed that MLT treatment reduced the elevated levels of COX-2 and VEGF, which are critical players in the inflammatory process. Histopathological examination demonstrated that MLT preserved the structural integrity of myocardial tissues, reducing 5-FU-induced damage score in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, MLT co-administration significantly attenuated the rise in cardiac biomarkers, including LDH, AST, and CK-MB, associated with 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight that MLT, through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, exerts a protective effect against 5-FU-induced toxicity, suggesting its therapeutic potential for improving cardiovascular health during chemotherapy."

Melatonin (MET) is a hormone that plays crucial physiological roles in anti-inflammatory capacities of fish. We explored the function of MET (100 μM) to mitigate the toxicity induced by THI (20 μM) in lymphocytes. Our results indicate that THI led to a notable rise in lymphocyte mortality. Lymphocytes exposed to THI exhibited a heightened incidence of pyroptosis, accompanied by upregulation in expression associated with pyroptosis (NLRP3, GSDMEA, and IL-18). Meanwhile, THI exposure led to a decrease in lymphocyte mitochondrial membrane potential, an increase in mtROS levels, and a reduction in intracellular ATP, DNA, and NADPH/NADP+ levels, indicating an imbalance in the mitochondrial metabolism within the lymphocytes. Additionally, these effects were reversed by MET treatment, where MitoQ treatment showed that the suppression of mtROS reduced the lymphocyte pyroptosis caused by THI via the mtROS/cGAS-STING/NF-κB axis. Importantly, MET provided defense against the immunotoxic impacts of THI by ameliorating pyroptosis and enhancing anti-inflammatory capability via the mtROS/cGAS-STING/NF-κB axis. Our research potentiates the safeguarding of cultured fish from biological hazards caused by THI and highlights the valuable application of MET in common carp.",

However, its role in regulating phenolic compounds and the phenylpropane metabolism during pepper ripening is unclear. To investigate how exogenous MT regulates phenolic compounds biosynthesis during pepper ripening, pepper plant surfaces were sprayed with different MT concentrations (0 and 100 µmol·L-1) 10 days after anthesis. MT treatment improved pepper fruits quality. In particular, total phenolics and flavonoids compounds levels were elevated, indicating that MT affected phenolic compounds metabolism. Furthermore, metabolomics identified 15 substances exhibiting high fold-change values after MT treatment, including chlorogenic acid, gallic acid, ferulic acid, caffeic acid, cynarin, p-coumaric acid, cinnamic acid, gentianic acid, benzoic acid, sinapic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, protocatechuic acid, rutin, quercetin, and kaempferol. Shikimate dehydrogenase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase, 4-coumarate-Coa ligase, chalcone synthase, and chalcone isomerase activities were also evaluated. MT upregulated the expression of genes involved in phenolic compounds synthesis during pepper ripening and that of corresponding genes involved in the endogenous MT anabolic pathway, promoting endogenous. The polyphenolics and carbohydrates are indicators of the botanical and geographical origin of Serbian autochthonous clones of red spice MT synthesis throughout pepper ripening. In summary, exogenous MT accelerates phenolic compounds synthesis in pepper fruits by activating phenylpropane metabolism and modulating endogenous hormone signaling networks. This is expected to offer a revolutionary strategy to reinforce pepper plants resistance and quality."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Diabetic wounds are open lesions that can develop on any part of the body of diabetic patients. Importantly, melatonin (Mel) exerts promotional effects on wound healing. Accordingly, this study explored the mechanism of Mel in diabetic wound healing by mediating mitochondrial function in endothelial cells. METHODS: Human umbilical vein vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to high glucose (HG) to mimic a diabetic environment in vitro, followed by Mel treatment. Cell viability, invasion and angiogenic capacity were evaluated with CCK-8, Transwell, and tube formation assays, respectively. CD31 protein expression was determined with Western blot. Wound healing ability was evaluated in vitro, and the levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2/Bax/CytC) were also detected. To verify the role of the AMPK/SIRT1/HIF-1α pathway in diabetic wound healing, HG-induced HUVECs treated with Mel were subjected to treatment with sh-HIF-1α, AMPK inhibitor (compound c), or SIRT1 inhibitor (Nicotinamide). RESULTS: HG impaired the proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and wound healing ability of HUVEC, increased ROS, Bax, and CytC levels, and decreased MMP and the levels of ATP and Bcl-2. Mel facilitated viability, angiogenesis, and wound healing ability while ameliorating mitochondrial dysfunction in HG-treated HUVECs. Mel activated the AMPK/SIRT1 pathway to upregulate HIF-1α in HG-treated HUVECs. HIF-1α knockdown, CC, or Nicotinamide negated the effect of Mel on HG-treated HUVECs. CONCLUSIONS: Mel fosters angiogenesis and represses mitochondrial dysfunction in endothelial cells by activating the AMPK/SIRT1/HIF-1α pathway, thereby promoting diabetic wound healing."

In this study, fifty-six adult female albino rats were divided into seven groups (n = 8 each), served as control, GBN, MEL, BP, MEL + GBN, BP + GBN, and MEL + BP + GBN treated groups. Results showed that oral administration of GBN resulted in a hematological toxicity as confirmed by a significant reduction in RBCs, Hb concentration, Ht%, MCV, MCH, platelets as well as altering of leukocyte profiles, WBCs, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils. The biochemical results of liver and kidney functions showed a significant decrease in serum glucose, total protein, triglycerides, urea and uric acid. However, a significant increase in albumin, cholesterol, creatinine as well as ALP, AST, and ALT liver enzymes compared to the control was found. The oral administration of MEL and BP 12 h before GBN mostly ameliorates the altered hematological and biochemical parameters as well as hepatic and renal histopathological architecture to normal levels. In conclusion, Pre-treatment with MEL and BP, individually or together provided protection against the GBN induced changes in the blood parameters as well as hepatorenal structure and function."

Chronic arterial disease, i.e., AS, is frequently linked to oxidative stress and inflammation as significant contributing causes. AS risk factors, such as hyperlipidemia, high blood pressure, age, hyperglycemia, smoking, high cholesterol, and irregular sleep patterns, can exacerbate AS in the carotid artery and further shrink its lumen. Finding new approaches that support plaque inhibition or stability is an ongoing problem. The last ten years have shown us that melatonin (MLT) affects the cardiovascular system, although its exact mechanisms of action are yet unknown. MLT's direct free radical scavenger activity, its indirect antioxidant qualities, and its anti-inflammatory capabilities all contribute to its atheroprotective effects on several pathogenic signaling pathways. Herein, we examine the evidence showing that MLT treatment has significant protective effects against AS and AS-related cardiovascular diseases. The numerous pieces of the puzzle that have been as for epigenetic and biogenetic targets for prevention and therapy against the atherosclerotic pathogenic processes are identified.",

This systematic review aimed to critically analyze the randomized clinical studies on the therapeutic effects of perioperative melatonin administration in patients submitted to joint arthroplasty. It was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Eight articles were progressed to final analysis. The effect of melatonin administration on postoperative pain and sleep quality was assessed by six studies while its effect on delirium was assessed by two studies.

In this study, we applied exogenous melatonin (MT) to treat maize seeds and seedlings to investigate the alleviation mechanism of salt damage in maize. Phenotypic analyses showed that 100 µmol/L MT alleviated the effects of salt stress on maize seed germination, and germination index and vigor index were increased compared with salt treatment. MT also alleviated the effects of salt stress on biomass and photosynthesis of maize seedlings, and at a concentration of 100 µmol/L, root and shoot lengths were increased, Gs and Tr were significantly elevated, and LWUEint and LWUEins were decreased. MT also scavenged ROS accumulation, reduced MDA, H2O2, and O2- production, and increased antioxidant enzyme activities and osmoregulatory substances in maize seedlings, but too high a concentration exacerbated oxidative and osmotic stresses. In addition, MT reduced Na+ content and increased K+ content in leaves and roots of maize seedlings. The principal components analysis explained 99.1% of the total variance in the first two axes (PC1 and PC2), and the differences between the treatment groups along the PC1 and PC2 axes were obvious. Correlation analysis elucidated the correlation between the indicators. Random forest analysis showed that different treatments had significant effects on germination percentage (GP), free proline (FP), CAT, and leaf intrinsic water use efficiency (LWUEint). Partial least squares analysis showed that photosynthetic parameters and pigment content played an important role in the salt tolerance of maize seedlings. In conclusion, the application of exogenous MT can effectively alleviate the negative effects of salt stress on the growth of maize seeds and seedlings, especially at a concentration of 100 µmol/L, which is the most effective."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Given the growing challenges posed by an ageing population, particularly in Western countries, we aimed to investigate the potential geroprotective effects of resveratrol and melatonin in ageing rats. METHODS: The animals were treated with these two compounds starting at 3 months of age and continuing until 1 year or 2 years of age. Using a multibiomarker approach, we assessed DNA damage, telomere length, and the oxidative status in their urine, liver, and kidneys. RESULTS: Despite employing this experimental approach, our results did not provide conclusive evidence of geroprotective effects across the evaluated organs. However, we observed sex-dependent differences in response to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Given the high potency of these two compounds, further research is warranted to explore their incorporation into daily routines as a strategy to mitigate ageing-related effects.",

      "abstract": "In research flocks, supplementing pregnant ewes with melatonin has been shown to be a novel approach to ameliorate parturient neurological damage and improve twin lamb survival. This study investigated the commercial applicability of melatonin supplementation for Merino flocks managed under extensive grazing conditions. Multiparous twin-bearing ewes were implanted with one melatonin implant (18 mg, Regulin®) each on two properties in South Australia and one in Western Australia (n = 585) at a median 79 days of gestation, with control ewes not implanted (n = 586). Ewes were managed as per standard protocols for each property. Lambs and ewes were counted at tail docking and weaning, and the lambs were weighed at weaning. Lamb survival was not influenced by melatonin treatment at either tail docking (p = 0.327) or weaning (p = 0.546). Across all sites, lamb survival at weaning for control and melatonin treatments was 74.7% and 74.0%, respectively, with lamb weaning weight of 27.2 ± 0.1 kg and 26.8 ± 0.1 kg (p = 0.020). These results indicate that supplementing twin-bearing Merino ewes with melatonin during mid-gestation was not a practical strategy to increase either lamb survival or weaning weight on commercial farms."

This study investigates the protective effects of prenatal melatonin on liver injury in male pups resulting from maternal exposure to a HFD and microplastics. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either an HFD or a normal chow diet, with some groups exposed to microplastics alone or in combination with melatonin. Male pups were evaluated on postnatal day 7. Results indicated that pups in the HFD-microplastics group (HFD-Mi) exhibited increased liver lipid accumulation (observed in histological staining), apoptosis (elevated cleaved caspase 3, phospho-AKT, and TUNEL staining), inflammation (higher IL- 6 and TNF-α), and oxidative stress (elevated malondialdehyde). Conversely, melatonin treatment (HFD-Mi + M) significantly reduced these effects, including lipid accumulation, apoptosis, and inflammation, while enhancing antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase activity and improving lipid metabolism (reduced SREBP- 1 expression). These findings suggest that prenatal melatonin mitigates liver injury caused by maternal HFD and microplastics through its anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and lipid-regulating properties, underscoring its potential hepatoprotective role."

METHODS: Sixty male rats were divided into six groups: Control group (C) (n: 10), Sham group (S) (n: 10), Ischemia Reperfusion group (IR) (n: 10), Group that was treated with melatonin intraperitoneally after ischemia reperfusion (IR+M) (n: 10), Group in which AD-MSCs were applied locally after ischemia reperfusion (IR+MSC) (n: 10), and group that after IR, melatonin and AD-MSCs were administered (IR+MSC+M) (n: 10). Five rats from each group were sacrificed on day 3 and five of them on day 14. Blood samples were analyzed for BUN and creatinine. Histological analysis was performed. RESULTS: BUN and creatinine levels were higher in the IR group compared to the groups (p < 0.05). There was a statistically significant decrease in creatinine levels in the IR+MSC+M group on day 14. BUN levels decreased significantly in the M and IR+MSC+M groups (p < 0.05). Losses in the glomerular epithelium and tubule cells, enlargement, and hemorrhage areas in the bowman space were detected in the IR group. The histologic scoring was significantly lower in the IR+MSC+M group on the 14th day (p < 0.05). While Caspase-3 and Bax expression increased in the IR group, it decreased in the treatment group, especially on day 14 (p < 0.05). Bcl-2 expression was negative in all structures in the IR group, whereas it was increased in the treatment groups. The apoptosis rate was highest in the IR group and decreased in the treatment groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Melatonin and MSC were effective in ischemia-reperfusion injury by improving renal function and inducing the anti-apoptotic pathway."

      "abstract": "Glaucoma is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease that affects the retina and optic nerve. The aim of this work was to reach different therapeutics targets by co-encapsulating three neuroprotective substances with hypotensive (latanoprost), antioxidant (melatonin) and anti-inflammatory (ketorolac) activity in biodegradable poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres (MSs) capable of releasing the drugs for months after intravitreal injection, avoiding the need for repeated administrations. Multi-loaded PLGA MSs were prepared using the oil-in-water emulsion solvent extraction-evaporation technique and physicochemically characterized. PLGA 85:15 was the polymer ratio selected for the selected formulation. Tri-loaded MSs including vitamin E as additive showed good tolerance in retinal pigment epithelium cells after 24 h exposure (>90% cell viability). The final formulation (KMLVE) resulted in 33.58 ± 5.44 µm particle size and drug content (µg/mg MSs) of 39.70 ± 5.89, 67.28 ± 4.17 and 7.51 ± 0.58 for melatonin, ketorolac and latanoprost respectively. KMLVE were able to release in a sustained manner the three drugs over 70 days. KMLVE were injected at 2 and 12 weeks in Long-Evans rats (n = 20) after the induction of chronic glaucoma. Ophthalmological tests were performed and compared to not treated glaucomatous (n = 45) and healthy (n = 17) animals. Treated glaucomatous rats reached the lowest intraocular pressure, enhanced functionality of bipolar and retinal ganglion cells and showed greater neuroretinal thickness by optical coherence tomography (p < 0.05) compared to not treated glaucomatous rats at 24 weeks follow-up. According to the results, the tri-loaded microspheres can be considered as promising controlled-release system for the treatment of glaucoma.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disorder that predominantly affects the elderly. Characterized by amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, AD leads to memory loss, cognitive decline, and severe behavioral changes. As the most common form of dementia, AD imposes a significant global health burden, highlighting the need for interventions that address underlying disease mechanisms rather than only symptomatic treatment. Glial cells, including microglia and astrocytes, play a crucial role in AD progression by mediating neuroinflammatory responses and modulating Aβ clearance and neuronal health. Dysfunction in these cells can exacerbate neuroinflammation and neuronal damage, making glial cells an important target for therapeutic intervention. This review synthesizes findings from in vivo and in vitro studies on melatonin's effects on glial cell dysfunction in AD, emphasizing the multi-mechanistic nature of its neuroprotective properties. Recent studies highlight melatonin's potential as a therapeutic agent that addresses AD-related mechanisms through its interactions with glial cells. Melatonin has demonstrated protective effects, including reducing oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation, inhibiting Aβ fibrillogenesis, and modulating amyloid precursor proteins. Additionally, its influence on glial cell activity, through melatonin receptor pathways, suggests it can alleviate neuroinflammation, a key component of AD progression. The collective evidence points to melatonin's promise as a therapeutic tool with potential roles in both preventive and adjunctive treatments for AD. However, further research is necessary to establish its efficacy and safety in clinical settings."

This study examined the effects of melatonin (1 mM) and modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) on preserving the quality, biochemical properties, and organic acid contents of persimmons, as well as extending their shelf life during storage at 0°C ± 0.5°C. The MAP resulted in the lowest weight loss, recording only 6.63%. The combination of melatonin and MAP provided the highest fruit firmness at 8.69 kg/cm2, along with a total antioxidant level of 12.40 μmol TE 100 g-1. Additionally, this treatment improved total phenolic content and most individual organic acids, except for fumaric acid, which was highest in the MAP treatment. The organic acid contents of the fruits varied during storage, depending on the specific acid. Malic acid was the predominant organic acid and was consistently better preserved by the treatments compared to the control. It is important to note that the reduction in malic acid was approximately 1.5 times less in the treated fruits than in the controls, while the decline of other organic acids was 3-4 times greater. In conclusion, both MAP and the combination of melatonin and MAP were effective methods for preserving the quality attributes and extending the shelf life of persimmon fruits."

      "abstract": "Ethylene, a plant hormone, is essential for apple (Malus domestica) ripening. The precise molecular mechanism by which melatonin (MT) influences ethylene biosynthesis during apple fruit ripening remains unclear. This study found that exogenous MT treatment inhibited ethylene production and postponed apple fruit ripening. The endogenous MT content of apple fruits exhibited an inverse correlation with ethylene production during fruit ripening, suggesting that MT functions as a ripening suppressor in apple fruits. MT treatment suppressed the expression of key ethylene biosynthesis genes, MdACS1 and MdACO1, during apple fruit ripening. MT treatment decreased the expression levels of transcription factors MdREM10 and MdZF32. MdREM10 binds to the MdERF3 promoter, enhancing its expression and subsequently promoting MdACS1 transcription. Furthermore, MdREM10 directly bound to the MdZF32 promoter, promoting its transcription. MdZF32 directly bound to the MdACO1 promoter, inducing its expression. The findings suggested that MT suppresses ethylene biosynthesis and fruit ripening by inhibiting MdREM10, which indirectly promotes MdACS1 transcription via MdERF3 upregulation, and MdACO1 transcription via MdZF32 upregulation."

These phytohormones help mulberry fruit in maintaining its postharvest quality and soft texture, prevent from spoiling during cold. For this purpose, mulberry fruit were stored in cold for 5, 10 and 15 day (0.5 °C and 90% RH) and the impacts of melatonin (1.0 mM) and putrescine (1.0 mM) on quality parameters, phenolic compounds (gallic, protocatechuic, catechin, syringic, p-coumaric, chlorogenic, o-coumaric, ferulic, phloridzin, rutin and quercetin) and organic acids (malic, citric, succinic, oxalic, tartaric, fumaric and ascorbic) were investigated. RESULTS: The combined application of putrescine and melatonin maintained the weight loss (4.35%), decay rate (9.48%) and 29.89% lower respiration rate (6.07 mg CO2 kg- 1 h- 1) in mulberry fruits stored for 15 d as compared to the control. Phenolic compounds (especially rutin) and organic acids were found to be more affected by melatonin and putrescine applications compared to other findings in this study. However, melatonin treatment is more effective in maintaining the level of organic acids and phenolic compounds in mulberry fruit during storage than the putrescine. It was determined that soluble solids content, weight loss, decay rate and pH values had a positive relationship with each other. Also, it was also seen that phenolic compounds and organic acids had a linear relationship. CONCLUSION: The combined application of melatonin and putrescine was found more effective in maintaining the quality parameters of mulberry fruits during cold storage.",

However, grape is soft, juicy, and prone to rotting and deterioration, making them unsuitable for storage. To ensure grape quality and extend its shelf life, this study applied salicylic acid (SA), melatonin (MT), and SA + MT treatments to postharvest mature grape. The appearance index, antioxidant content, enzyme activity, and gene expression levels of fruits stored at low temperatures for varying durations were measured. The results showed that SA, MT, and SA + MT treatments effectively reduced the browning index(BI), minimized weight loss(WL), and preserved the contents of ascorbic acid (AsA), soluble sugars (SS), and soluble proteins (SP). Compared to the control group, the contents of total phenols (TP), flavonoids (TF), proline (Pro), and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) were higher in each hormone treatment group, while malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and the activities of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) were lower. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that MT treatment was most effective, followed by SA and SA + MT treatments. Correlation analysis indicated a positive correlation between the contents of TP and TF and their associated structural enzymes. Furthermore, the expression levels of genes related to phenolic and flavonoid synthesis (VvPAL, VvCHI, VvF3H2, VvANR) were significantly upregulated in all treatment groups. This study provides a foundation for further exploring the effects of hormones on postharvest grape."

We investigated the involvement of Yes-associated protein (YAP)-mediated Hippo signaling in blue light-induced apoptosis, depending on the degree of blue light exposure. Additionally, we elucidated the effects of melatonin on blue light-irradiated keratinocytes and examined their action mechanisms. After blue light irradiation, its effects and antagonizing effects of melatonin on cell proliferation, apoptosis, DNA damage, and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)/YAP-mediated signaling were examined in HaCaT cells using western blots, image analysis, flow cytometric analysis, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunocytochemistry. We found that melatonin treatment attenuated the reduced cell viability and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to blue light irradiation. In the experiments to investigate the mechanism of action of blue light and melatonin, we found that YAP changed its binding protein, either p73 or TEAD, depending on the degree of blue light exposure. Melatonin treatment reduced blue light-induced phosphorylation of TRPV1 and MST1/2. Upon treatment with capsazepine, an antagonist of TRPV1, MST1/2 activation also reduced. Furthermore, we found that prolonged blue light irradiation induced DNA damage, which in turn induced YAP-p73 nuclear translocation. These effects were also notably attenuated by melatonin. These findings indicate that depending on the duration of blue light irradiation, two different YAP-mediated Hippo signaling pathways are activated. Additionally, these findings suggest that melatonin could be a potential therapeutic agent for blue light-induced skin damage.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anthocyanins are essential secondary metabolites in plants, significantly contributing to fruit coloration and offering a wide range of health benefits to consumers. This study investigated the effect of melatonin treatment on anthocyanin biosynthesis in 'Baifeng' peaches during storage. The peaches were treated with 100 μmol L-1 melatonin and stored at room temperature (25 ± 1°C) for 9 days. The total anthocyanin content, enzymatic activities, and gene expression levels were measured, and anthocyanin derivatives were analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). RESULTS: The transcription factors (TFs) bHLH63 (Prupe.8G095700), MYB44 (Prupe.1G430000), and WD40-1 (Prupe.2G319500) were identified through transcriptome sequencing. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed that cyanidin- and pelargonidin-derived compounds play the most significant role in color formation in 'Baifeng' peaches. In the melatonin-treated group, fruit firmness was significantly higher than that in the control, whereas ethylene production, anthocyanin content, anthocyanin synthase activity, and the expression levels of anthocyanin-encoding genes and TFs were markedly lower compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: The application of melatonin inhibited anthocyanin synthesis in peach fruit, as evidenced by the suppression of upstream transcriptional regulation, gene expression, and downstream metabolite accumulation. This effect may be associated with melatonin's inhibition of ethylene production. Further in-depth studies are needed to provide more detailed validation at the molecular level. The results have elucidated the underlying mechanisms responsible for the postharvest changes in the flesh phenotype of 'Baifeng' peaches following melatonin treatment. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry."

      "abstract": "The purpose of this investigational study was to assess the cardiovascular effects of melatonin replacement therapy in pinealectomized patients. This was a prospective open-label, single-arm proof-of-concept study The study comprised 11 patients aged 16.7 ± 1.7 years, who had undergone pinealectomy, experienced no tumor recurrence, and exhibited undetectable salivary melatonin levels. A 6-month melatonin regimen (0.3 mg daily) was administered. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was conducted at baseline, 3-month, and 6-month intervals. First of all, no hypertension was observed in pinealectomized patients. Over the course of the study, diastolic blood pressure progressively decreased, reaching statistical significance at 6 months. Pulse pressure exhibited a gradual increase, reaching statistical significance after 6 months. Short-term blood pressure variability increased significantly for both systolic and diastolic pressures. Morning systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels were significantly decreased by melatonin replacement therapy. Melatonin had no effect on the average heart rate or its variability. Melatonin-deficient pinealectomized patients were normotensive. Melatonin replacement in these patients led to reduced diastolic pressure, increased pulse pressure, and enhanced short-term blood pressure variability. These results are consistent with improved cardiovascular health. Furthermore, melatonin's temporal specificity suggests that it might enhance nighttime recovery, heightening reactivity during wakefulness. While melatonin is used as a dietary supplement for similar effects, caution is advised, and further research is needed to optimize its use in various health and disease contexts. Further, considering the study's limitations, more extensive research would strengthen these findings.",

HEI-OC1 cells were exposed to different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to induce oxidative stress and subsequently analyzed by Western blotting to measure pyroptosis-related proteins - NLRP3, caspase-1, and GSDMD-N. Compared with untreated control cells, exposure to different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) promoted premature senescence of HEI-OC1 cells, accompanied by a significant increase in levels of pyroptosis-related proteins - NLRP3, caspase-1, and GSDMD-N. Furthermore, melatonin treatment was shown to decrease the expression of these proteins in HEI-OC1 cells and attenuate the H2O2-induced senescence process. NLRP3 inflammasome activation contributes to oxidative stress-induced premature senescence of HEI-OC1 cells in vitro, leading to pyroptosis. Melatonin attenuates pyroptosis and senescence in HEI-OC1 cells by inhibiting the expression of NLRP3, caspase-1, and GSDMD-N, providing reliable evidence for melatonin as a potential therapeutic agent for age-related hearing loss."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The present study was carried out to compare biomarkers of oxidative stress and antioxidant activity of agomelatine and melatonin in bitches undergoing laparoscopic ovariectomy. Twenty-four healthy female dogs were randomly divided into four groups: Control (C), laparoscopic ovariectomy (LO), agomelatine + laparoscopic ovariectomy (ALO), and melatonin + laparoscopic ovariectomy (MLO) consisting of 6 animals each. Melatonin and agomelatine were administered to the MLO group (0.3 mg/kg/day, p.o) and the ALO group (0.3 mg/kg/day, p.o) consequently one day before LO to 7 days post-intervention. Blood sampling was performed on days - 1, 0 (immediately after surgery), 3, and 8 of the study. Total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in sera and superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in hemolyzed red blood cells (RBCs) were measured. RESULTS: Among all indices analyzed over time, only the MDA index in the ALO group showed a significant difference, being significantly lower on day 3 post-surgery compared to days - 1 and 0 (p = 0.023). Significant differences were observed between groups in terms of TOS, TAC, GPx, and SOD levels. The LO group exhibited a significant increase in the TOS index on day 3 compared to all other groups (p = 0.008). The TAC index experienced the most significant increase in the MLO group on day 0 compared to other groups (p = 0.005), and this trend continued significantly until day 3, only in comparison to the LO and C groups (p = 0.024). Agomelatine significantly increased SOD levels in the ALO group on postoperative day 3 compared to groups C and LO (p = 0.009). GPx levels were significantly elevated in ALO and MLO groups on day 8 compared to groups C and LO (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate that melatonin, by increasing total antioxidant capacity, and agomelatine, through enzymatic antioxidant pathways, contributed to the reduction of free radical levels in dogs. The present study revealed that administering agomelatine (0.3 mg/kg/day, p.o) could decrease MDA levels significantly after laparoscopic ovariectomy up to day 3.",

      "abstract": "Myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) injury poses a severe threat to cardiac health, particularly in the ageing population, where susceptibility to such damage is significantly heightened owing to age-related declines in mitochondrial function, thus highlighting mitochondria as crucial targets for innovative therapies. The aim of this study was to investigate the combined modality therapy involving mitochondrial transplantation and the mitochondrial boosters mitoquinone and melatonin to address myocardial IR injury in aged rats. A total of 54 male Wistar rats, aged 22-24 months, were randomly divided into groups that either received IR injury or not, and were subjected to various treatments, both individually and in combination. Myocardial IR injury was induced by temporarily blocking and reopening the left anterior descending coronary artery. Mitoquinone was given intraperitoneally for 14 days prior to ischaemia, while melatonin and isolated mitochondria were administered intraperitoneally and intramyocardially, respectively, at the onset of reperfusion. Finally, we evaluated changes in haemodynamic indices, creatine kinase-MB levels, mitochondrial function endpoints and the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis genes, including sirtuin 1 (SIRT-1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) and nuclear respiratory factor 2 (NRF-2). The triple therapy enhanced myocardial function, decreased creatine kinase-MB levels and improved mitochondrial function along with the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis genes in aged IR rats. This combined approach elicited significant cardioprotection in comparison to single or dual therapies. The triple therapy provided substantial cardioprotection in aged rat hearts by improving mitochondrial function and biogenesis through enhanced SIRT-1/PGC-1α/NRF-2 profiles, suggesting a promising strategy for mitigating IR injury in elderly patients."

      "abstract": "Acute ischemic stroke is undoubtedly the leading cause of mortality and disability throughout the world, and the efficient treatment is limited so far. Therefore, potentially effective drugs for acute ischemic cerebral damage and subsequent ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury are urgently needed. Here, we explored the protective role of melatonin in I/R and investigated the possible molecular mechanism that might affect neuronal autophagy and survival following I/R injury. Our results showed that melatonin can rescue the oxidative stress and cell viability caused by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). Moreover, melatonin treatment significantly increased miR-221 levels in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent manner, thereby mediating the neuroprotective effect of melatonin. Further, we discovered that ATG7 is a target gene of miR-221, indicating that the melatonin-mediated autophagy regulation mechanism is through the miR-221 and ATG7 pathways. Also, we evaluated the more potent combined effect of melatonin and miR-221 on OGD/R SH-SY5Y cells and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) animals. Together, our study revealed previously unappreciated mechanism of melatonin that mediate neuronal protection through a novel ROS/miR-221/ATG7 axis. The combined application of melatonin and miR-221 is expected to be a potential treatment for inhibiting neuronal damage in stroke patients.",

      "abstract": "The study of growth and development of lambs (Ovis aries) is essential in sheep farming, and melatonin plays an important role in the physiology of growing lambs. The effects of an exogenous melatonin treatment on several physiological characteristics in fattening lambs at weaning were studied. Eight lambs were assigned to one of two groups; those that did (melatonin group, n = 4) or did not (no-melatonin group, n = 4) receive two subcutaneous melatonin implants at weaning. At the end of the fattening period, to quantify locomotor activity (LA), each lamb was fitted with a triaxial accelerometer, for 7 days. Simultaneously, lambs received a surgically implanted subcutaneous temperature (T) and heart rate (HR) biologger, which was programmed to record data every 5 min. HR variability (HRV) variables (SDNN, the standard deviation of normal-to-normal R-R intervals, and RMSSD, the root mean square of consecutive deviations between normal heartbeats) were measured. All of the variables exhibited 24-h circadian rhythms. Time of day (daytime vs. nighttime) had a significant effect on LA, T, and HR, but considering both treatment with melatonin and time, differences between time for these variables were only observed in melatonin-treated lambs. Exogenous melatonin did not affect LA or T, but melatonin-treated lambs had lower HR, SDNN, and RMSSD than did non-treated lambs. In conclusion, the use of subcutaneous biologgers and triaxial accelerometers in growing lambs demonstrated circadian rhythms in LA, T, HR, and HRV, and melatonin treatment negatively affected HRV, but its effects on the other physiological variables differed between day and night."

Aiming to investigate the combinational effect of melatonin (MLT) on the antiepileptic action and retinal damage of VGB, a rat epilepsy model was induced by intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid (KA) and evaluated via both Racine grading and electroencephalogram (EEG). MLT (5, 10, 20 mg/kg) and VGB (50, 150 mg/kg) were administered intragastrically for 4 weeks, alone or together. The behavioral performance was measured during the remission of seizures via a series of tasks including the open field test (OFT), beam walking test (BW), Y-maze, and novel object recognition test (NOR). The morphological changes of the hippocampus and retina were observed using HE, Nissl, or immunofluorescence staining. Furthermore, the expression of proteins associated with synaptic plasticity and the Wnt/β-catenin/GSK3β signaling pathway were assessed. The results showed that intraperitoneal injection of KA could induce not only seizure, but also long-term behavioral impairments of sense, motion, and learning and memory in rats. Moreover, VGB could alleviate the neuroinflammation and balance the expression of synaptic plasticity and Wnt/β-catenin/GSK3β pathway proteins of epileptic rats. A combination of MLT couldn't enhance the effect of VGB in prolonging the seizure latency but presented an additive effect in alleviating the seizures grading V and improving the behavioral performance in the BW. Crucially, the combination of MLT considerably reduced the retinal cell damage caused by VGB. These results suggested that MLT could be a beneficial combination for VGB in the treatment of epilepsy, which might provide fresh insight into the clinical application of VGB and MLT.",

Melatonin (MT) as a protective biostimulant, plays a crucial role in plant growth under harsh environments. However, the role of MT in plant adaptation to acidic soil remains elusive. Hence, here we tested the effects of exogenous MT on the adaptation of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) crop to acidic soil (pH 4.0). Initially, a series of MT concentrations (0, 25, 50, 100, and 200 μM) were tested to evaluate the seed germination and growth attributes of spinach under low pH levels. Among the doses, 100 μM MT showed better results in terms of germination percentage and biomass accumulation, which was then selected for further experiments. Results showed that exogenous MT significantly increased plant adaptation to acidic soil as evidenced by increased photosynthesis rate and biomass accumulation with enhanced total antioxidant capacity, DPPH free radical scavenging, phenol, flavonoid, and glutathione contents compared with soil acidity treatment alone. Moreover, MT alleviated oxidative stress indices such as electrolyte leakage and malondialdehyde in acid-stressed plants, suggesting an effective strategy of adaptation. Furthermore, MT-treated plants exhibited higher macro and micronutrient accumulation along with higher vitamin B complex, vitamin C, and protein content, leading to an increased nutritional quality and yield compared to control. Therefore, the study concludes that the application of MT at 100 μM could be a sustainable alternative approach to adapt spinach farming in acidic soil."

We drafted this research to define the results of combining agmatine and melatonin on stress-induced depression in mice. METHODS: Experimental groups included the non-stressed group treated with vehicle (ethanol at a concentration of 0.0005%), stressed vehicle (ethanol at a concentration of 0.0005%)-treated group, group treated with fluoxetine (10 mg/kg/day), group treated with melatonin (10 mg/kg/day), group treated with agmatine (1 mg/kg/day), group receiving a combination of melatonin (10 mg/kg/day) and agmatine (1 mg/kg/day). The animals were subjected to restraint stress for two hours daily for a duration of one week, concurrently with the daily oral administration of agents through drinking water. Open field test and forced swimming test were operated on the 8th day. The oxidative stress markers were measured in the mice hippocampus. RESULTS: Stress led to the elevation of immobility time. The combination group showed a significant effect in comparison to the agmatine and melatonin groups. The combination of melatonin and agmatine was successful in the elevation of hippocampus catalase activity; and this effect was comparable in the fluoxetine group. We observed enhancement of superoxide dismutase activity in treatment groups and reduction in malondialdehyde levels in melatonin, agmatine and combination groups. CONCLUSION: A combination of agmatine and melatonin improves stress-induced depression more effectively than each alone, which may result from suppressing oxidative stress."

Sleep disturbances, prevalent in up to 80% of individuals with ASD, significantly impact well-being. Central to circadian rhythms, melatonin emerges as a promising intervention, primarily recognized for its role in sleep regulation. This review explores melatonin's multifactor impact on ASD, covering sleep regulation, behavioral outcomes, neuroprotection, and potential synergies with other therapies. Melatonin exhibits promise in ameliorating sleep disturbances and enhancing overall well-being, with implications for social behaviors, communication, and repetitive behaviors. Its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties further suggest potential neuroprotective benefits. Future research directions focus on mechanistic insights, individualized medicine, and real-world effectiveness. As melatonin's versatile role unfolds, it stands as a valuable component in the personalized care of individuals navigating the complexities of ASD."

      "abstract": "Melatonin is evaluated as a potential molecular therapy to counteract mitochondrial dysfunction caused by hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) in aortic endothelial cells (pAECs). The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening undergoes a desensitizing action coupled with a reduction of superoxide anion production in mitochondria treated with melatonin. The effect on mPTP has been attributed to the direct interaction of melatonin with the hydrophilic F1 domain of Ca2+-activated F1FO-ATPase. Mutual exclusion analysis highlights an overlapping binding site between melatonin and the specific F1 inhibitor NBD-Cl. The results are corroborated by melatonin inhibition of ATPase activity of the purified F1 domain in the presence of Ca2+, but not in the presence of natural cofactor Mg2+. Moreover, the impairment of bioenergetics parameters in pAECs metabolism and the increase of oxidative stress arising by H/R injury have been rescued in cells protected by melatonin treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hepatotoxicity of pyrazinamide, an antituberculosis drug, limits its therapeutic use and oxidative stress has been implicated in this toxicity. This study investigated the protective effects of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), melatonin, and Liv-52, which have previously been shown antioxidant activities, on pyrazinamide-induced hepatotoxicity. METHODS: 36 albino Wistar male rats were divided into randomized six groups; healthy (HG), pyrazinamide (PZG), ATP + pyrazinamide (APZG), TPP + pyrazinamide (TPZG), melatonin + pyrazinamide (MPZG) and Liv-52 + pyrazinamide (LPZG) groups. ATP 4 mg/kg and TPP 25 mg/kg were administered intraperitoneally (IP). Melatonin 10 mg/kg and Liv-52 20 mg/kg were given orally. One hour after administration of ATP, TPP, melatonin, and Liv-52, 250 mg/kg pyrazinamide was applied orally to all rats except HG group. The treatment was repeated (1 × 1) for 4 weeks. Then, blood samples were taken for determination of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities. Immediately after, the rats were euthanized with thiopental sodium (50 mg/kg, IP), and the livers were removed. The tissues were analyzed for malondialdehyde (MDA), total glutathione (tGSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) also hydropic degeneration, necrosis, and apoptosis (caspase 3) were examined.One-Way ANOVA was used in biochemical analyses and Tukey test was used as post-hoc. For histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis, the Kruskal-Wallis test was used and Dunn's test as a post-hoc. RESULTS: Pyrazinamide increased MDA land decreased tGSH, SOD, and CAT levels in liver tissues (p < 0.001). It also increased serum ALT and AST activities and caused severe hydropic degeneration and necrosis in liver tissue (p < 0.001). ATP, TPP, melatonin, and Liv-52 significantly prevented the biochemical and histopathological changes induced by pyrazinamide (p < 0.05). On the other hand, Liv-52 was more successful than other potential protectors in protecting liver tissue from pyrazinamide damage (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: ATP, TPP, melatonin, and Liv-52 can be used to protect liver tissue from pyrazinamide-induced hepatotoxicity in rats.",

      "abstract": "The build-up of senescent cells in tissues is a key indicator of aging, associated with negative prognosis and therapy resistance. Despite immune dysfunction related to aging, also known as immunosenescence, is recognized as a factor in this process, the exact mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, we reported that melatonin deficiency accelerated macrophage senescence in triple-negative breast cancer, whereas melatonin could defend macrophages against senescence through the Nfatc1-Trim26-cgas-Sting pathway. Mechanistically, melatonin enhanced the nuclear translocation of Nfatc1 and elevated Trim26 transcription levels. Trim26, functioning as an E3 ligase, ubiquitinates cgas, thereby inhibiting the activation of the cgas-Sing pathway and consequently preventing cell senescence. Conversely, melatonin deficiency induced cgas-Sting pathway activation to promote macrophage aging. Our results show that melatonin inhibited macrophage senescence and improved chemotherapy responsiveness, with further enhancement when combined with the cgas inhibitor (G150). Overall, our findings indicated that melatonin protects macrophages from immunosenescence, suggesting its therapeutic potential for enhancing chemotherapy response."

      "abstract": "Colospheroids contain colon cancer stem cells (CSCs) that cause colorectal cancer metastasis (mCRC). Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S. Little is known about the role of mitochondria in the survival and metastatic ability of CSCs. In this study, we investigate the effect of andrographolide (AGP) and melatonin (MLT) on mitochondrial dynamics (including fusion and fission) and the expression of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs). Our results show that AGP and MLT synergistically reduce the total active mitochondrial mass, downregulate fusion and fission proteins, reduce OXPHOS proteins, and lead to CSC growth inhibition via Nrf2 and KEAP1 signaling. Microarray revealed 4389 differentially expressed mRNAs in the AGP and MLT combination compared to the control. Results exhibiting a three-fold induction/reduction were validated by qRT-PCR and immunoblot. MRPS6, a mitochondrial ribosomal (Mitoribosome) small subunit protein, was dramatically downregulated by AGP + MLT treatment compared to control. MRPS6 inhibition by siRNA reduced mCRC cell viability. Molecular docking-based protein-ligand interactions showed that AGP has direct physical interaction with MRPS6 and increases the binding affinity of MLT to MRPS6. This drug combination downregulated genes in the NRF2 (NFE2L2) pathway in CSCs. MRPS6 may be directly linked to CSC proliferation and could be a therapeutic target for this population. Functionally, MRPS6 knockdown significantly reduced colony formation, with enhanced suppression in AGP + MLT-treated cells. In xenograft models, the AGP-MLT combination synergistically decreased MRPS6 expression and increased apoptosis, as evidenced by TUNEL assays, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of targeting MRPS6 in CRC.",

      "abstract": "Melatonin, the \"sleep hormone,\" shows significant promise in dentistry owing to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. It is beneficial for treating periodontal disorders and aiding osseointegration of dental implants. Additionally, melatonin helps to manage dental anxiety, offering an alternative to traditional sedatives. Periodontal disease is orchestrated by bacterial plaques along with an exaggerated immune-inflammatory host response. Treatment of periodontitis not only involves the removal of plaque, but also aims to minimize the cytokine load and control the reactive oxygen species burden in the tissues, which would re-establish a healthy periodontium and a balanced bone metabolism. Melatonin is known to exert beneficial effects, such as regulation of circadian rhythm, bone remodeling, and antimicrobial effects. Recent studies have demonstrated the successful use of melatonin as an adjunct to mechanical debridement for the treatment of periodontal disease. Its various uses include systemic administration of melatonin after one-stage full-mouth Non-Surgical Periodontal Therapy in healthy subjects as well as patients. This article provides a summary of the various clinical applications of melatonin, describing its mechanism of action, uses, and potential avenues for future research in dentistry.",

      "abstract": "This research focused on improving the drought tolerance of Dracocephalum moldavica, a plant vulnerable to water stress, by exploring the combined effects of melatonin spray and mycorrhizal fungus Glomus intraradices inoculation. The experiment was designed as a factorial randomized study to evaluate the plant's morphological, physiological, and phytochemical responses under different drought conditions (100%, 75%, and 50% field capacity). The findings revealed that the combination of melatonin and mycorrhizal inoculation significantly improved the morphological traits of Moldavian balm under drought conditions. Under severe drought (50% field capacity), chlorophyll a and b levels increased by 26.3% and 35.5%, respectively, when both treatments were applied. Stress indicators, including electrolyte leakage and malondialdehyde content, were substantially reduced with the simultaneous application of melatonin and mycorrhizal symbiosis, indicating decreased cellular damage. Moreover, the combined treatment resulted in the highest activities of the antioxidant enzymes catalase and peroxidase, suggesting that these treatments bolster the plant's oxidative stress defense mechanisms. Additionally, drought stress alone led to an increase in secondary metabolites like phenolic and flavonoid compounds, which were further amplified by the treatments. The study also observed significant alterations in the essential oil composition of the plant. Drought stress increased the levels of α-pinene, 1,8-cineole, and borneol, and these increases were even more pronounced with the combined treatments. Conversely, the levels of geraniol and geranial decreased under drought stress and further with treatment. Overall, this research demonstrates that melatonin and Glomus intraradices inoculation can effectively enhance drought tolerance in Dracocephalum moldavica by improving its physiological characteristics and biochemical composition.",

Melatonin (Mel) is involved in many physiological and biochemical reactions in plants, which can enhance the resistance of plants to abiotic stress. However, the mechanism of exogenous Mel in maize seedlings under low nitrogen stress is still unknown. This experiment adopts the method of sand culture, Zhengdan 958 was used as the experimental variety, and three nitrogen levels (5mmolL-1, 2mmolL-1, 0.1mmolL-1) and two Mel treatment conditions (no exogenous Mel and 1μmolL-1 exogenous Mel) were set up to explore the effects of exogenous Mel on the growth and photosynthesis of maize seedlings under low nitrogen stress. The growth of maize seedlings under low nitrogen stress was significantly inhibited. Exogenous melatonin (Mel) increased the shoot dry weight by 11.74 % and 17.57 % under mild and severe low nitrogen stress, respectively. It promoted root growth, enhanced nitrogen accumulation in the shoots, and improved the net photosynthetic rate of maize seedlings, with increases of 14.85 % and 24.77 % under mild and severe low nitrogen stress, respectively.Exogenous Mel improved the activity of the reaction centers in photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII), increased electron transport rates, thereby enhancing light energy conversion efficiency and allocating more light energy to photochemical reactions. Additionally, exogenous Mel effectively alleviated the photo-oxidative damage to the photosynthetic systems caused by low nitrogen stress. This study demonstrated that exogenous Mel could significantly mitigate the inhibitory effects of low nitrogen stress on maize seedling growth."

Here, we show that exposing mouse zygotes to ZEA in vitro significantly impairs embryo development, leading to embryo arrest. Remarkably, treatment of ZEA-exposed mouse embryos with melatonin significantly improved the blastocyst rates from approximately 40 % to nearly 80 %. Furthermore, melatonin effectively mitigates the harmful effects of ZEA exposure by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, preventing mitochondrial dysfunction, and decreasing cell apoptosis. Following embryo transplantation, the birth rate of offspring increased markedly from 7.2 % to 23.62 %. Further research revealed that the abnormal elevation of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) signaling induced by ZEA exposure, coupled with the inhibition of the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, contributes to developmental blockade in ZEA-exposed mouse embryos. Melatonin rescued ZEA-induced defects in mouse embryo development by inhibiting BMP4 signaling and regulating the MAPK pathway. Moreover, the Bmp4 inhibitor Noggin or its receptor inhibitor DMH-1 could also effectively ameliorate the ZEA-induced impairment of embryo development. Taken together, these findings underscore the potential of melatonin as a therapeutic intervention for addressing the adverse effects of ZEA exposure on mouse embryos.",

      "abstract": "Melatonin plays a crucial role in enhancing plant resistance to salt stress by regulating biosynthesis of specialized metabolites. Phenylpropanoids, especially lignin, contribute to all aspects of plant responses toward biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the crosstalk between melatonin and lignin is largely unknown in pigeon pea under salt stress. In this study, the cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase CcCAD10 was identified to be involved in melatonin treatment and salt stress. The content of lignin was significantly increased in CcCAD10 over-expression (OE) lines, the enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities, indicating enhanced salt resistance. As a parallel branch of the lignin synthesis pathway, the content of flavonoids was further determined. The accumulations of luteolin, genistin, genistein, biochain A, apigenin and isovitexin were down-regulated in CcCAD10-OE hairy root. The results indicate that CcCAD10-OE mediated carbon flow from the phenylalanine pathway is redirected to the lignin pathway at the expense of less carbon flow in the flavonoid pathway, enhancing the salt-tolerance. Furthermore, we found the exogenous melatonin stimulated endogenous melatonin production mainly by upregulating the expression of CcASMT2 gene. This study reveals a novel mechanism by which melatonin enhances salt tolerance in pigeon pea, which laid a foundation for exploring the molecular mechanism of melatonin in salt stress response.",

Agitation, salivary cortisol, and salivary melatonin were measured at baseline and four weeks. Salivary cortisol and melatonin indicators were generated through three timepoints of cortisol and melatonin collection across the two consecutive days. Presence of agitation was measured using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Logistic regressions were conducted to achieve the aim.ResultsA significant association was found at baseline between diurnal cortisol slope and agitation (OR = 0.03, p = 0.029), there were no relationships between all other cortisol or melatonin indicators with agitation. Cortisol awaking response (OR = 0.16, p = 0.048), its percentage (OR = 0.27, p = 0.021) and its increase higher than 50% (OR = 0.09, p = 0.009), were significant with agitation at four weeks.ConclusionsGiven the potential link between cortisol and agitation, exploring cortisol-lowering interventions like minimizing environmental stressors, smoothing transitions to different situations, stress-reduction techniques, and behavioral therapies may aid in managing agitation in older adults with cognitive impairment.",

In the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, we assessed if melatonin use for 38 months affected the timing of pubertal onset in males (N=3,134) and menarche in females (N=4,424). Pubertal outcomes were parent-reported using the Pubertal Development Scale. We emulated sequential target trials to evaluate the effect of initiating and continuing melatonin supplement use. Findings were contrasted with comparisons of ever- to never-users and initiators to non-initiators using Cox models. In sequentially emulated trials with 1,037,709 person-months among males and 1,818,084 person-months among females, there were 1,872 and 3,377 instances of melatonin use initiation among 186 males and 333 females, respectively. Observational analogues of intention-to-treat and per-protocol effects from target trial emulation showed no difference in risk of pubertal onset in males (end-of-follow-up per-protocol RR=1.00, 95%CI=0.87,1.13) or menarche in females (RR=0.93, 95%CI=0.80,1.07). By contrast, Cox models suggested a delay in menarche among 335(7.74%) melatonin ever-users after adjustment for child, family, and neighborhood characteristics collected at the enrollment visit (HR=0.80, 95%CI=(0.69,0.94)). In large samples, rigorous causal analyses that aligned eligibility criteria with treatment initiation and adjusted for time-varying confounding showed no effect of melatonin supplement use on pubertal timing."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Melatonin has been shown to have neuroprotective effects. This study is aimed at observing the effects of copper deposition on cognitive function in a toxic milk (TX) mouse model of Wilson disease (WD), and investigating the effects and mechanisms of action of Gandou Bushen Decoction (GDBSD) on melatonin synthesis and pineal function in the WD model mice. METHODS: A total of 30 homozygous TX mice were randomly assigned to 3 groups (n = 10 in each group), including a WD group, a GDBSD group, and a dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) group. A total of 10 DL mice were included in the normal control (NC) group. The structure and copper content of pineal gland tissues, oxidative stress and apoptosis-related markers, and serum melatonin levels were evaluated using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), flow cytometry, and Western blot. RESULTS: Compared with the NC group, the WD group exhibited decreased learning and cognitive abilities (P < 0.05), damaged pineal gland structure, increased copper content, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and mitochondrial damage rate in the pineal gland (P < 0.01), altered levels of melatonin and oxidative stress-related markers (P < 0.05), upregulated expression levels of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Caspase-3, and decreased expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 (P < 0.01). After treatment with GDBSD and DMSA, the SIRT3/FOXO3α signaling pathway was activated, the copper content in the pineal gland was reduced, and oxidative stress and apoptosis-related damages were improved, leading to an improvement in learning and memory abilities (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: GDBSD can alleviate cognitive impairments in WD mice caused by pineal gland copper deposition by inhibiting oxidative stress and apoptosis in the pineal gland. The underlying molecular mechanism is associated with the regulation of the SIRT3/FOXO3α signaling pathway.",

AIM: The present study aimed to assess the effect of adjutant administration of Sildenafil plus Melatonin on psycho-sexual status in PCOS women undergoing Metformin in an Iranian population. METHODS: This study was a randomized clinical trial. 216 Eligible women were assigned to four groups including Sildenafil plus Metformin, Melatonin plus Metformin, Melatonin plus Sildenafil and Metformin, and Metformin alone. The duration of intervention was 3 months. OUTCOMES: The Female Sexual Function Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and modified PCOS health-related QOL questionnaire were used to evaluate sexual function, severity of depression and HRQOL, respectively. RESULTS: Based on the results of the present study, statistically significant improvement was found in menstrual cyclicity, sexual function (desire and arousal), HRQOL concerning menstrual and emotional aspects and severity of depression between the groups before and after the intervention in Sildenafil plus Melatonin compared to other groups after 3 months (P < 0.05). CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The present research determined administration of Sildenafil plus Melatonin enhances menstrual cyclicity status, mental well-being, sexual function, and HRQOL in women with PCOS who undergoing Metformin treatment. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: The current research possesses several strengths, notably its adherence to the rigorous standards of a randomized controlled trial with well-defined initial inclusion criteria. In addition, this questionnaire is based on the previously ratified tools used. A robust sample size was maintained, enhancing the statistical power of the analysis. However, all the sample participants were sourced from a university referral clinic. Additionally, due to cultural norms, every participant in this study was married. Lastly, the absence of a post-intervention follow-up period is a notable gap; such a period could help determine the duration of the clinical effects or assess if ongoing treatment with Sildenafil plus Melatonin is necessary to sustain these effects. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this initial randomized controlled trial indicate that a 12-week administration of Sildenafil plus Melatonin could enhance menstrual cyclicity status, reduce depression severity, and sexual function as well as HRQOL in women with PCOS who undergoing Metformin."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline and synaptic dysfunction, largely driven by amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. These pathological hallmarks disrupt glutamate signaling, which is essential for synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. This study investigates the therapeutic potential of melatonin on memory and synaptic plasticity in an AD-like mouse model, with a focus on its regulatory effects on glutamate homeostasis and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). METHODS: The study began with an in-silico bioinformatics analysis of RNA-seq datasets from hippocampal tissues of AD patients to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to glutamate signaling and tau pathology. An AD-like model was induced via intra-hippocampal injection of cis-phospho tau in C57BL/6 mice. Memory function was assessed using behavioral tests. Synaptic plasticity was evaluated using in vitro field potential recording of hippocampal slices. Histological analyses included Nissl staining for neuronal density, Luxol Fast Blue for myelin integrity, and immunofluorescence for tau hyperphosphorylation. Molecular studies employed qPCR and Western blot to assess glutamate-related markers and tau phosphorylation. Melatonin (10 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally, starting either two weeks (early intervention) or four weeks (late intervention) post-induction. RESULTS: Key molecular targets in glutamate signaling pathways were identified using bioinformatics. AD-like mice displayed memory deficits and synaptic dysfunction. Melatonin improved cognitive function, especially with early intervention, as confirmed by behavioral tests. Histological studies revealed reduced neuronal loss, improved myelin integrity, and decreased tau hyperphosphorylation. Molecular findings showed restored mGluR expression and reduced GSK3 activity. Early intervention yielded superior outcomes, with partial restoration of synaptic plasticity observed in LTP recordings. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the neuroprotective properties of melatonin, mediated by its ability to modulate glutamate signaling and mGluR activity, offering new insights into its potential as a therapeutic agent for AD. Additionally, the results suggest that earlier administration of melatonin may significantly enhance its efficacy, highlighting the importance of timely intervention in neurodegenerative diseases.",

Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic approaches to prevent pancreatic malignancy remains crucial. This study aimed to investigate the potential of melatonin in enhancing gemcitabine's anticancer efficacy while mitigating its nephrotoxic effects through modulation of the Keap1/p62 pathway. A pancreatic cancer xenograft model was established in rats, which received either gemcitabine (50 mg/kg, I.P.), melatonin (50 mg/kg, I.P.), or their combination three times per week for 2 weeks. Our findings demonstrate that melatonin potentiates gemcitabine's cancer-suppressing effects via modulation of the Kelch-like-ECH associated protein-1 (Keap1)/p62 pathway, resulting in reduced fibrosis, oxidative stress, and inflammatory markers. Additionally, melatonin significantly mitigated gemcitabine-induced nephrotoxicity. These results suggest that melatonin may serve as an adjuvant therapy in pancreatic cancer treatment, enhancing chemotherapy efficacy while reducing its adverse effects."

Melatonin (MT) application has been found to be effective in mitigating chilling injury in cold-stored vegetables and fruits. Thus, considering the importance of chilling stress in water bamboo shoots, we have examined the impact of exogenous MT application under cold storage. It was found that exogenous MT increased the expression of ZlCDPK12 and decreased the expression of genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway, including ZlPOD16, ZlC4H, ZlPAL1, ZlCAD2, and ZlCCR1. It delayed skin browning and softening, reduced weight loss, and maintained total phenol and flavonoid contents while reducing lignin deposition. Moreover, the transcript abundance of phenylpropane metabolism-related transcription factors ZlERF4, ZlbHLH49, and ZlMYC2.2 is correlated with promoter DNA methylation. Overall, our study provides insights into how exogenous MT treatment effectively inhibits the deterioration of water bamboo shoots during cold storage. Furthermore, the integration of transcriptome and DNA methylation data lays a foundation for future improvements through genetic engineering.",

MAIN METHODS: KCl-induced contractions of non-pregnant and pregnant uterine rings samples (whole or endometrium-denuded) were investigated in an organ bath in the presence of ramelteon alone or with melatonin (MT) receptor antagonist luzindole or with the high-conductance calcium-dependent potassium channel (BKCa) blocker paxilline. The changes in melatonin receptor expressions were followed by RT-PCR, Western blot, and fluorescent immunohistochemistry. KEY FINDINGS: Ramelteon inhibited uterine contractions, with the degree of inhibition being greater towards the end of pregnancy. Both MT1 and MT2 receptors were identified in all uteri (except gestational day 5); they do not participate in the relaxing effect of ramelteon in non-pregnant and 5-day pregnant samples. The activation of BKCa appears to be a constitutive component of the uterorelaxant action of ramelteon throughout the gestational period. Endometrial melatonin receptors have a significant impact in mediating relaxation in mid- and late pregnancy. SIGNIFICANCE: Ramelteon has a relaxing effect on mid- and late-pregnant uteri through at least a dual mechanism of action. The alteration of melatonin receptors during the gestational period raises the possibility that melatonin receptors might be potential drug targets for the treatment of premature labour."

While its functions in vertebrates are well established, the MT system remains poorly understood in echinoderms. To elucidate MT synthesis regulation, we examined AjAsmt, a pivotal enzyme in MT biosynthesis, to determine its tissue-specific distribution in Apostichopus japonicus. AjAsmt was predominantly expressed in the nerve ring, polian vesicle, intestine, and muscle, with significantly reduced intestinal expression post-spawning, suggesting a role in ovarian development and physiological regulation. Building on this, we characterized the molecular and functional properties of AjMTNR using computational analyses and in vitro assays. MT treatment triggered AjMTNR internalization and elevated intracellular cAMP and Ca2+ levels. Notably, AjMTNR was highly expressed in the gonads, prompting an investigation into MT's role in estradiol (E2) secretion. In vitro experiments confirmed that MT stimulates E2 secretion in ovarian tissue in a concentration-dependent manner. These findings enhance our understanding of the MT system's physiological functions and provide valuable insights for the reproductive management and aquaculture of A. japonicus.",

Preliminary findings suggest that it has the potential to attenuate secondary brain injury following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). This observational study aimed to investigate the effect of melatonin on post-ICH mortality and functional outcomes. Methods: We conducted an exploratory analysis of data from a single-center, non-randomized, prospective cohort study involving 177 non-ventilated patients with spontaneous ICH consecutively admitted to the Stroke Unit at the University Hospital of Tübingen, Germany, between December 2015 and December 2020. Patients received either the best standard of care (control group) or the best standard of care plus melatonin (2 mg nightly), initiated within 24 h of symptom onset and continued until discharge. The primary endpoint was mortality at discharge, while secondary endpoints included mortality at 90 days and favorable outcomes (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] ≤ 2) at both discharge and a 90-day follow-up. To minimize baseline differences, propensity score matching (PSM) was employed in the secondary analysis. Additionally, ordinal mRS shift analysis was performed to assess the patients' functional status at discharge. Results: In the full cohort (84 melatonin-treated patients vs. 93 controls), melatonin was not associated with any of the primary or secondary outcomes. In the PSM cohort (38 melatonin-treated patients vs. 38 controls), mortality at discharge was three times lower in the melatonin group compared to the control group (2.6% vs. 7.9%), although this trend did not reach statistical significance (ORadj: 0.372; 95% CI: 0.036-3.843; p = 0.407). Ordinal mRS analysis revealed no significant association between melatonin and functional status at discharge (common OR: 0.762; 95% CI: 0.327-1.773; p = 0.527). Similarly, the melatonin treatment was not associated with 90-day mortality (ORadj: 1.519; 95% CI: 0.295-7.826; p = 0.617) or the functional outcome at 90 days (ORadj: 0.626; 95% CI: 0.198-1.983; p = 0.426). Conclusions: Although 2 mg of melatonin daily did not significantly reduce mortality or improve functional outcomes in ICH patients, robust preclinical evidence and the favorable safety profile of melatonin warrant its further exploration in adequately powered, randomized-controlled clinical trials to evaluate optimized dosing regimens."

      "abstract": "The tomato is among the crops with the most extensive cultivated area and greatest consumption in our nation; nonetheless, secondary salinization of facility soil significantly hinders the sustainable growth of facility agriculture. Melatonin (MT), as an innovative plant growth regulator, is essential in stress responses. This research used a hydroponic setup to replicate saline stress conditions. Different endogenous levels of melatonin (MT) were established by foliar spraying of 100 μmol·L-1 MT, the MT synthesis inhibitor p-CPA (100 μmol·L-1), and a combination of p-CPA and MT, to investigate the mechanism by which MT mitigates the effects of salt stress on the photosynthetic efficiency of tomato seedlings. Results indicated that after six days of salt stress, the endogenous MT content in tomato seedlings drastically decreased, with declines in the net photosynthetic rate and photosystem performance indices (PItotal and PIabs). The OJIP fluorescence curve exhibited distortion, characterized by anomalous K-band and L-band manifestations. Exogenous MT dramatically enhanced the gene (TrpDC, T5H, SNAcT, and AcSNMT) expression of critical enzymes in MT synthesis, therefore boosting the level of endogenous MT. The application of MT enhanced the photosynthetic parameters. MT treatment decreased the fluorescence intensities of the J-phase and I-phase in the OJIP curve under salt stress, attenuated the irregularities in the K-band and L-band performance, and concurrently enhanced quantum yield and energy partitioning ratios. It specifically elevated φPo, φEo, and ψo, while decreasing φDo. The therapy enhanced parameters of both the membrane model (ABS/RC, DIo/RC, ETo/RC, and TRo/RC) and leaf model (ABS/CSm, TRo/CSm, ETo/CSm, and DIo/CSm). Conversely, the injection of exogenous p-CPA exacerbated salt stress-related damage to the photosystem of tomato seedlings and diminished the beneficial effects of MT. The findings suggest that exogenous MT mitigates salt stress-induced photoinhibition by (1) modulating endogenous MT concentrations, (2) augmenting PSII reaction center functionality, (3) safeguarding the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC), (4) reinstating PSI redox potential, (5) facilitating photosynthetic electron transport, and (6) optimizing energy absorption and dissipation. As a result, MT markedly enhanced photochemical performance and facilitated development and salt stress resilience in tomato seedlings."

Seedlings were treated with MT at concentrations of 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 μmol/L through irrigation, followed by drought stress induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG-6000). The results revealed that MT alleviated growth damage caused by PEG-simulated drought stress, with leaf relative conductivity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content showing an initial decrease followed by an increase as MT concentration rose. In contrast, relative water content, chlorophyll content, antioxidant enzyme activity, secondary metabolite levels, and carbohydrate content initially increased and then declined with increasing MT concentration. Treatment with 200 μmol/L MT notably reduced MDA content by 40-50%, enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity by 20-30%, and increased secondary metabolite levels by 11-42% in the drought-sensitive variety. These findings identified 200 μmol/L MT as the optimal concentration for mitigating drought stress in C. hainanica seedlings, providing a foundation for its practical application in C. hainanica production and further research into the drought resistance mechanisms mediated by MT."

      "abstract": "Objective: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a pervasive health issue associated with various complications, including cognitive impairment and depression among patients undergoing hemodialysis. This study aimed to assess the impact of melatonin on depression and cognitive function in hemodialysis patients. Method : A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in 50 hemodialysis patients, with half of the patients receiving 3 mg daily melatonin and the other half receiving a placebo for two months. Depression and cognitive function were evaluated using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) questionnaire, respectively. Quantitative variables were analyzed using a t-test. The Chi-square test also evaluated qualitative variables. Quantitative data were analyzed by covariance analysis before and after the intervention. Results: Hypertension was the most prevalent underlying condition among study participants, affecting 40% of the intervention group. The intervention group exhibited baseline depressive symptoms (mean BDI score: 16.12 ± 7.12), which significantly improved post-intervention (13.6 ± 6.6). Notably, both the intervention and control groups demonstrated significant reductions in depressive symptoms, as assessed by paired t-tests (P = 0.033 and P = 0.02, respectively). Cognitive function, as measured by the MMSE, improved in both groups (1.28 ± 0.81 for melatonin, 1.52 ± 0.1 for placebo), with significant within-group differences (P = 0.048 and P = 0.002, respectively). ANCOVA analysis revealed no significant between-group differences in BDI scores (F(1,47) = 0.196, P = 0.66, partial eta-squared = 0.004). and in MMSE scores (F(1,47) = 0.003, P = 0.954, partial eta-squared = 0.00) post-intervention. Conclusion: While this study did not demonstrate significant effects of melatonin on depression and cognitive impairment in hemodialysis patients, positive changes were observed, warranting further research to optimize treatment regimens and explore the potential therapeutic benefits of melatonin in this patient population."

      "abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in women, and metastasis is a leading cause of mortality in patients with this disease. This study investigated the effects of melatonin, a natural hormone, on the migration of cancer cells in two cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in their respective media. The effective dose of melatonin in each cell line was determined using the MTT assay. The effects of IC50 melatonin on cell migration were assessed using the wound-healing assay. The expression of the invasion-related genes (MMP2 and MMP9), as well as the melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2, was analyzed using Real-Time RT-PCR. The wound-healing assay results indicated that 48 h of melatonin treatment at doses of 2.5 and 3.5 M significantly reduced migration in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, melatonin treatment decreased the invasion-related markers of both cell lines. Melatonin also increased the expression of MT1 and MT2 receptors in both cell lines, and the expression of MMP2 and MMP9 was significantly reduced by melatonin (p < 0.05). Our results indicate that melatonin, a naturally occurring compound, possesses the potential to inhibit the movement and spread of breast cancer cells by elevating the levels of MT1 and MT2 receptors, resulting in a reduction of matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 expression.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is an aggressive and lethal cancer with limited treatment options and poor prognosis. Monoacylglycerol lipase (MGLL), a key enzyme in lipid metabolism, is thought to play a role in tumor progression, but its function in PAAD remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the expression and functional significance of MGLL in pancreatic cancer and evaluate melatonin (MLT) as a potential inhibitor of MGLL. METHODS: Tissue samples from 22 PAAD patients were collected and analyzed by immunohistochemistry to assess MGLL expression. Bioinformatics tools, including GEPIA and the Human Protein Atlas, were used to compare MGLL expression in pancreatic cancer versus normal tissue, and survival analysis was conducted. In vitro assays, including CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing, and Transwell, were performed on PANC-1 cells to explore the effects of MGLL knockdown using siRNA. Western blotting was used to analyze the impact of MGLL on the P-AKT/AKT signaling pathway and MMP-2/9 expression. The effect of MLT on MGLL expression was evaluated using RNA-seq and qRT-PCR. RESULTS: MGLL was significantly overexpressed in PAAD tissues and was associated with poor patient prognosis. Silencing MGLL in PANC-1 cells reduced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, likely via the P-AKT/AKT pathway. MLT treatment effectively downregulated MGLL expression, as well as MMP-2 and MMP-9, suggesting that MLT could serve as a potential MGLL inhibitor. CONCLUSION: MGLL promotes pancreatic cancer progression through the P-AKT/AKT signaling pathway, and MLT may offer a novel therapeutic strategy by inhibiting MGLL expression. These findings highlight MGLL as a potential therapeutic target for PAAD.",

      "abstract": "One of the complication of diabetes mellitus is chronic wounds. The healing of wounds in diabetic patients is retarded by the elevation in the pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion and free radicles accumulation. Wound management in diabetic patients requires preventing bacterial biofilm development. Due to the wound healing activity of chitosan (CS), lecithin (Le) and melatonin (M), the present study aimed to load melatonin on CS/Le NPs and examine their effect on diabetic wounds infected with Staphylococcus aureus. Melatonin loaded chitosan/lecithin nanoparticles (M-CS/Le NPs) were physically characterized and their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities were examined in vitro. Male Sprague Dawley rats included two division (non-diabetic and diabetic) which were further divided in nine groups. Diabetes induction and follow up throughout the experimental period was confirmed by measuring the levels of fructosamine and blood glucose. Full-thickness wounds was induced in both non-diabetic and diabetic animals followed by infection with Staphylococcus aureus according to the experimental design. The wound healing effect of M-CS/Le NPs was evaluated through measurements of the oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines and apoptotic proteins. Our results showed the anti-microbial, free radical scavenging and hemolysis inhibition effects of M-CS/Le NPs in vitro. Moreover, the preparation of M-CS/Le NPs decreased the dose of used melatonin (when compared to free melatonin). M-CS/Le NPs significantly decreased the wound area percent in treated infected wounds of both non-diabetic and diabetic rats more than free melatonin or unloaded CS/Le NPs. In conclusion, M-CS/Le NPs promoted the wound healing in Staphylococcus aureus-infected wounds in diabetic rats."

A comprehensive study was planned to investigate the effect of cysteamine 50 µM and melatonin 10-9 mol L-1 as antioxidants on ΔΨM, in vitro nuclear maturation and developmental competence of ovum pick up (OPU) derived Sahiwal Cow oocytes. Culturable grade OPU derived Sahiwal oocytes were divided in to three in vitro maturation groups cultured in TCM-199 supplemented with cysteamine 50 µM, melatonin 10-9 mol L-1 and TCM-199 alone, for assessing nuclear maturation by Lamin/ DAPI and developmental competence of oocytes. ΔΨM was assessed by JC-1 staining in pre-maturation group and post-maturation cysteamine, melatonin and control groups. Red to green ratio of fluorescence intensity on JC-1 staining was higher (p < 0.05) in melatonin (1.19 ± 0.04) and cysteamine (1.09 ± 0.04) supplementation groups as compared to control (0.81 ± 0.10) and pre-maturation (0.71 ± 0.03) groups. ΔΨM improved post-maturation in all the treatment and control groups as compared to pre-maturation group (0.71 ± 0.03). Melatonin supplementation improved (p < 0.05) M-II stage oocytes (6.5 ± 0.65, 68.13 per cent) as compared to cysteamine supplemented (5.25 ± 0.25, 55.63 per cent) and control (4.75 ± 0.25, 50.63 per cent) groups. COC expansion rate was higher in antioxidant supplemented group. Fertilization rate, cleavage rate and blastocyst rate were higher (p < 0.05) in melatonin supplemented group (92.31, 59.17 and 20.56 per cent) as compared to cysteamine supplemented (82.96, 41.48 and 11.39 per cent) and control (75.28, 27.59 and 5.19 per cent) groups, respectively. In conclusion, cysteamine and melatonin supplementation as antioxidants in the in vitro maturation media improved (p < 0.05) ΔΨM. Significant improvement in MII stage oocytes, cleavage and blastocyst rate in OPU derived Sahiwal cow oocytes by supplementation of melatonin to the IVM medium as compared to cysteamine supplemented and control groups. Melatonin improved both cytoplasmic (ΔΨM is improved) and nuclear maturation (no. of MII oocytes) by acting both as intracellular and extracellular antioxidant against ROS, thereby improving developmental competence of OPU derived Sahiwal Cow oocytes. Cysteamine supplementation improved cytoplasmic maturation by increasing GSH content thereby improving ΔΨM but not the nuclear maturation."

      "abstract": "Lactational period is of extreme importance for nourishing and fostering growth in neonates. Bisphenol S (BPS) a congener of bisphenol A (BPA) is an emerging environmental toxicant reported to have deleterious effects on reproductive health. Indirect exposure of BPS to the suckling infants via breastmilk is less explored although it can lead to various public health issues. Therefore, we investigated harmful effects of lactational BPS exposure on pre-pubertal and pubertal testicular functions of the offspring and its possible amelioration by melatonin. Lactating dams were divided into 4 groups: control, melatonin treated (3 mg/kg BW), BPS treated (150 mg/kg BW) and BPS + melatonin co-treatment; the male offspring were evaluated at pre-pubertal (PND 22) and pubertal (PND 42) testicular developmental stages. Lactational BPS exposure affected testicular physiology, led to histological abnormalities, hormonal imbalance, alters blood-testis-barrier (E-cadherin/connexin-43), redox modulators (SIRT-1/FOXO-1/PGC-1α; Nrf2/HO-1/pSTAT-3) and germ cell dynamicity (PCNA/TUNEL positive cells) in both pre-pubertal and pubertal mice. However, melatonin supplementation to BPS exposed lactating mothers improved testicular histoarchitecture in offspring, enhanced testicular antioxidant status, modulated expression of redox/survival and BTB markers that promoted germ cell proliferation. In conclusion, our study shows that lactational BPS exposure could be deleterious to testicular physiology that may result in male infertility/subfertility in later life while melatonin supplementation improves the reproductive health compromised by lactational BPS exposure.",

      "abstract": "Rationale: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most fatal form of brain cancer and its treatment represents a persistent challenge. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been explored as therapeutic tools in cancer management owing to their tumor-homing abilities. However, their clinical application is limited due to the controversial role of MSCs in carcinogenesis. This study investigates how MSCs influence tumor behavior and explores the synergistic anticancer effects in combination with melatonin (Mel). Methods: Orthotopic and subcutaneous GBM xenograft mouse models were used to assess the antitumor effect of Mel pre-treated MSCs (MSCMel). Histological, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural analyses were conducted to identify phenotypic changes in tumors. Through a set of in vitro assays, including direct and indirect co-cultures, dynamic single-cell tracking and tumorsphere assay, we explored the impact of MSCMel on primary and non-primary GBM cells. Transcriptomic profiling was used to identify genes and pathways modulated by this synergistic therapy. Results: MSCMel delayed tumor growth in mice and increased collagen deposition. Additionally, MSCMel showed enhanced capacity to prevent GBM cell migration compared to untreated MSCs. Molecular analysis identified genes and proteins related to cell migration, cytoskeletal dynamics and extracellular matrix remodeling in GBM cells exposed to MSCMel, including reduced vimentin expression. Finally, a genetic signature associated with the clinical outcomes of GBM patients was identified. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that melatonin enhances the anticancer properties of MSCs, providing new insights into their interaction with GBM cells and tumor environment. These findings offer valuable guidance for advancing MSC-based therapies in clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Arsenic (As), a widespread environmental pollutant, can induce severe neurological damage worldwide; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) has been reported to exert neuroprotective effects against various neurological diseases by resisting mitochondrial damage and autophagy through deacetylation. In this study, we established a model of HT22 cells exposed to NaAsO2 and examined the levels of mitochondrial, autophagy, and synaptic damage in HT22 cells and HT22 cells with high expression of SIRT1 (pre-treated with the agonist SRT1720) 24 h after exposure. Our results suggest that NaAsO2 exposure induces down-regulation of SIRT1, causing mitochondrial damage and activation of autophagy, which in turn leads to synaptic damage. Notably, melatonin (Mel) intervention upregulated SIRT1 and attenuated mitochondrial damage and autophagy, restoring synaptic damage. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that As causes neurotoxicity by decreasing SIRT1 production, causing mitochondrial damage and activating autophagy, which provides fundamental data for further study of arsenic neurotoxicity. In addition, blocking this pathway attenuated the synaptic damage of arsenic exposure, which provides a new therapeutic avenue for arsenic neurotoxicity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The hormone melatonin (MEL), primarily acknowledged for its role in regulating circadian rhythms, has demonstrated itself to be a complicated molecule with significant implications for vascular physiology. Melatonin exerts extensive physiological effects directly via the MEL receptor type 1 (MT1R) and the MEL receptor type 2 (MT2R), as well as indirectly through the improvement of antioxidant vascular tone. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to analyse the intricate relationships between MEL and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the vascular attenuation of non-diabetic (non-DM) and diabetic (DM) contexts. Alterations in the expression of RAS components and their dysregulation are prevalent in diabetes. Melatonin exhibits vasoprotective advantages in non-diabetic conditions. In the context of DM, vascular problrms such as vascular endothelial dysfunction (VED), hypertension, and atherosclerosis result from the dysregulation of MEL-RAS interactions. Comprehending the actions of MEL on RAS components in diabetes vasculature is essential for formulating tailored pharmaceutical therapy methods. CONCLUSION: This review consolidates existing knowledge regarding the vascular effects of MEL in relation to RAS activation, emphasising its potential role as a modulating factor for angiotensin 1-8 (Ang 1-8), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) in the management of vascular complications associated with DM."

      "abstract": "Maternal melatonin (MT) readily crosses the placental barrier to enter the fetal circulation, and it holds the potential to enhance hair follicle (HF) development, possibly augmented through nutritional interventions during pregnancy. However, the specific impact of maternal MT treatment on fetal HF development remains largely unexplored. In this study, we implanted pregnant rabbits with 10 mg of MT-containing and non-MT-containing silica gel microcapsules. We then assessed HF density and the extent of HF cell apoptosis in the neonatal rabbits. Our findings revealed that maternal MT implantation significantly reduced HF cell apoptosis and promoted an increased HF density in the neonates. Mechanistically, this process involved MT downregulating the expression of JUN/FOS and AP-1, while concurrently upregulating equol expression and reducing norepinephrine levels. Analysis of key protein expression within the MAPK pathway indicated that maternal MT activated this pathway. These results suggest that maternal MT treatment promotes beneficial HF development in offspring. Notably, the transcriptional regulation of JUN/FOS members of the AP-1 complex emerges as a pivotal factor mediating the beneficial effects of MT on neonatal hair follicle development.",

The experimental groups included control, ACR, MEL10+ACR, MEL20+ACR, and MEL20. MEL at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg, and ACR at 50 mg/kg, were administered intraperitoneally for 14 days. On the 15th day, locomotor activity was assessed, and brain tissues were analyzed biochemically, molecularly, and histopathologically. ACR exposure decreased locomotor activity, increased malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, indicating oxidative stress, and decreased antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, GPx, CAT). High-dose MEL (MEL20+ACR) effectively reduced lipid peroxidation and restored antioxidant enzyme activities. MEL treatment also suppressed proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), demonstrating anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, MEL mitigated ACR-induced neurotoxicity by reducing acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) levels. ER stress markers (GRP78, ATF4, ATF6, sXBP1, CHOP) and apoptotic markers (Bax, Caspase-3) were elevated following ACR exposure but were suppressed by MEL. Additionally, MEL reduced ACR-induced increases in 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), markers of DNA damage and astrocyte activation, respectively. These findings underscore the potential of MEL to counteract ACR-induced neurotoxicity through its comprehensive antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective actions.",

      "abstract": "Melatonin, also known as the pineal hormone, is secreted by the pineal gland and primarily regulates circadian rhythms. Additionally, it possesses immunomodulatory properties and anticancer effects. However, its specific mechanism in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear, particularly regarding its effect on HCC-mediated immune escape through PD-L1 expression.In this study, in vitro experiments were conducted using Huh7 and HepG2 HCC cells. Melatonin treatment was applied to both cell types to observe changes in malignant phenotypes. Additionally, melatonin-pretreated Huh7 or HepG2 cells were co-cultured with T cells to simulate the tumor microenvironment. The results showed that melatonin inhibited cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as reduced PD-L1 expression in cancer cells, exhibiting similar anti-cancer effects in the co-culture system. In vivo experiments involved establishing ascitic HCC mouse models using H22 cells, followed by subcutaneous tumor models in Balb/c nude and Balb/c wild-type mice. Melatonin inhibited tumor growth and suppressed PD-L1 expression in cancer tissues in both subcutaneous tumor models, and it increased T lymphocyte activity in the spleen of Balb/c wild-type mice. Overall, the in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that melatonin has dual anti-cancer effects in HCC: direct intrinsic anti-cancer activity and enhancement of anti-tumor immunity by reducing PD-L1 expression thereby inhibiting cancer immune escape. Furthermore, a decrease in the expression of the upstream molecule HIF-1α of PD-L1 and an increase in the expression levels of JNK, P38, and their phosphorylated forms were detected. Thus, the mechanism by which melatonin reduces PD-L1 may involve the downregulation of HIF-1α expression or the activation of the MAPK-JNK and MAPK-P38 pathways. This provides new insights and strategies for HCC treatment.",

      "abstract": "Melatonin has been shown to improve sleep quality in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with good safety and tolerability. Beyond its neurological benefits, emerging evidence suggests that melatonin may exert cardioprotective effects, which could be relevant in the context of sudden unexpected death in PD (SUDPAR). PD is associated with high mortality rates, and autonomic dysfunction and cardiac abnormalities may play a role in SUDPAR. Translational studies suggest that melatonin concentrations could serve as potential biomarkers for cardiac dysfunction in PD. Melatonin supplementation has demonstrated neuroprotective properties by modulating apoptosis, autophagy, oxidative stress, inflammation, α-synuclein aggregation, and dopamine loss. Additionally, clinical data indicate that melatonin levels are altered in patients with coronary heart disease, heart failure, and stroke. Reduced melatonin production is associated with increased risk of cardiac events and sudden cardiac death. Given its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, and vasomotor properties, melatonin may represent a promising adjunctive therapy for PD, potentially mitigating both neurological and cardiovascular risks."

OBJECTIVES: This trial aimed to evaluate the effects of melatonin on sleep problems and mood changes in breast cancer patients undergoing hormone therapy. METHODS: The study was conducted at Omid Hospital in Isfahan, Iran, using a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled design. Participants were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and were randomly assigned to receive either 6 mg of melatonin or a placebo daily for 4 weeks. Sleep quality, depression levels, and mood states were measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), and the Profile of Mood States (POMS) Questionnaires at the beginning and end of the 4-week follow-ups. RESULTS: Sixty participants (34 in the melatonin group and 26 in the placebo group) completed the study. Melatonin administration significantly improved sleep quality, latency, duration, and reduced the use of sleep-promoting medication, according to the PSQI scores. However, there were no significant improvements in depression severity or mood disorders, as assessed by the CES-D and POMS questionnaires, in either group following the 4-week melatonin supplementation period. CONCLUSIONS: Melatonin supplementation effectively alleviated sleep disturbances caused by hormone therapy in breast cancer patients. However, the study did not find substantial evidence supporting the use of melatonin for improving mood disorders or depression in this specific context."

Melatonin is a naturally occurring neurohormone that participates in the regulation of a large spectrum of biological functions. We investigated the effect of melatonin on periodontium regeneration both in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that melatonin promoted periodontitis recovery and enhanced the osteogenesis of inflamed PDLSCs (Inf-PDLSCs) depending on concentrations. Further mechanistic exploration indicated that autophagy activation played a significant role in enhancing the osteogenic differentiation of Inf-PDLSCs after melatonin treatment. Additionally, melatonin-induced upregulation of TEME110 participated in the initiation of autophagy activation and enhancement of osteogenesis in Inf-PDLSCs. Collectively, the results of our study provide evidence that melatonin-mediated osteogenesis of Inf-PDLSCs is important for periodontal tissue regeneration. Moreover, melatonin as a therapeutic drug for periodontitis treatment deserves further investigation.",

Recently, melatonin has been shown to recipient mitochondrial function and bone formation. However, the effects and underlying molecular mechanism of melatonin in chronic inflammatory bone loss remain unclear. Here, we reported that melatonin ameliorated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory bone loss by improving osteogenesis. We found that melatonin rescued LPS-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic reprogramming in osteoblasts, resulting in reduced osteogenesis impairment. Mechanistically, melatonin inhibited mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) production by suppressing LPS-induced mitophagy, which attenuated the activation of the mtROS/HIF-1α/pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) axis. Moreover, melatonin restored pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity by inhibiting phosphorylation of PDH through the mtROS/HIF-1α/PDK1 axis and eventually downregulated lactate production. These findings indicate the therapeutic effects of melatonin against chronic inflammatory bone loss and demonstrated a potential treatment strategy against inflammatory osteogenic disorders through regulating mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic reprogramming."

In our previous study, jujube quality was improved by application of nano-selenium (Nano-Se) and melatonin; however, little research has been conducted on the induced molecular mechanisms. Zizyphus jujuba cv. Huizao was used as experimental materials to compare and analyze the transcriptomics and metabolomics mechanisms. RESULTS: Compared with the control, 305, 422, and 240 metabolites and 24, 281, and 44 genes were significantly changed at the metabolic and transcriptional levels in Nano-Se, melatonin, and Nano-Se with melatonin treatments, respectively. The metabolomics indicated that the differentially expressed metabolites were involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, fructose, and mannose metabolic pathways. The Nano-Se with melatonin treatment group increased the contents of glucose and total Se by 1.8 and 5.4 times, respectively. Transcriptomics showed that differentially expressed genes of Nano-Se and melatonin treatment were mainly enriched in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, pentose, and glucuronate interconversions pathways. In addition, several transcription factors from the NAC, WRKY, MYB, and WRKY families were identified in melatonin versus control and melatonin versus Nano-Se. Furthermore, combined transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis showed that phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, starch and sucrose metabolism, the mutual conversion pathway of pentose, and glucuronate interconversions were the vital pathways in response to Nano-Se and melatonin treatment. CONCLUSION: Overall, these results provide new insights into jujube response to Nano-Se and melatonin, and improve our understanding of the jujube molecular mechanisms induced by Nano-Se and melatonin. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry."

Twenty cats were randomly divided into two groups: a control group (Cont), which underwent ovariohysterectomy without prior treatment, and a melatonin-treated group (Mel), which received 18 mg melatonin implants subcutaneously in the interscapular region before ovariohysterectomy. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses of uterine tissues were performed, along with quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot to assess inflammatory markers and progesterone receptor expression. Histopathological findings revealed normal uterine structures in most control cats, with mild inflammation observed in a few cases. In contrast, melatonin-treated cats exhibited varying degrees of uterine inflammation, ranging from mild to severe. Immunohistochemical analysis showed elevated IL-1β expression in the treated group compared to controls. Molecular analysis revealed significant upregulation of IL-6, TNF-α, NF-kB, IFN-γ, ICAM-1, and iNOS in uterine tissues of the treated group (p < 0.05). Western blot analysis confirmed increased IL-6, TNF-α, NF-kB, IFN-γ, and PGR protein expression in melatonin-treated cats, supporting inflammatory and hormonal alterations. Additionally, increased mRNA expression of progesterone receptor isoforms PR-A and PR-B was detected in ovarian tissues of melatonin-treated cats (p < 0.05). The results indicate that while melatonin implants effectively suppress estrus in female cats, they may induce uterine inflammation and alter the hormonal and immune profiles of reproductive tissues. These findings highlight the need for further investigation into the long-term safety and mechanisms of melatonin's effects on reproductive health.",

In this work, a series of melatonin-isatin hybrids were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as multifunctional agents for treating AD. In vitro studies indicated that most of the synthesized compounds displayed moderate to good MAO-B inhibition activities and good antioxidant activities. In particular, compounds IM-5 and IM-10 exhibited the best inhibitory activities with IC50 value of 12.4 μM and 15.6 μM against MAO-B, and potent antioxidant activities with their ORAC-FL values of 4.6 and 5.2 at 5 μM, respectively. ThT assay revealed compounds IM-5 and IM-10 exhibited the optimal Aβ1-42 self-induced aggregation inhibitory activities with the inhibition ratio of 72.8% and 69.7% at 20 μM. In addition, compounds IM-5 and IM-10 exhibited low cytotoxicities and significant neuroprotective effects on Aβ1-42-induced and H2O2-induced SH-SY5Y cell injury. More importantly, compounds IM-5 and IM-10 could significantly ameliorate the memory impairment and cognition injury in scopolamine-induced mice. The SwissADME program was used to predict drug-like properties of compounds IM-5 and IM-10 which exhibited they had good pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness properties. Molecular docking study further manifested that compounds IM-5 and IM-10 showed high hMAO-B inhibitory potency. In summary, all above results revealed compounds IM-5 and IM-10 might be promising multifunctional agents for AD treatment."

However, due to the complex pathological and physiological mechanisms of sepsis, the mechanisms of sepsis are currently not fully elucidated, and it is difficult to translate the research results into specific sepsis treatment methods. Melatonin possesses broad anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immune-regulatory properties, making it a promising therapeutic agent for sepsis. In recent years, further research has deepened our understanding of the potential mechanisms and application prospects of melatonin in sepsis. The mechanisms underlying the protective effects of melatonin in sepsis are multifaceted. In this review, based on a substantial body of clinical trials and animal research findings, we first highlighted the significance of melatonin as an important biomarker for disease progression and prognosis in sepsis. We also described the extensive regulatory mechanisms of melatonin in sepsis-induced organ damage. In addition to its broad anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant effects, melatonin exerts positive effects by regulating metabolic disorders, hemodynamics, cell autophagy, cellular ion channels, endothelial cell permeability, ferroptosis and other complex pathological mechanisms. Furthermore, as a safe exogenous supplement with low toxicity, melatonin demonstrates positive synergistic effects with other anti-sepsis agents. In the face of the urgent medical challenge of transforming the increasing knowledge of sepsis molecular mechanisms into therapeutic interventions to improve patient prognosis, melatonin seems to be a promising option.",

Based on the eligible criteria, four articles were selected for data synthesis and analysis after scanning the title and/or abstract and reading full-text. RESULTS: As a result of analysis, increasing ejection fraction (Mean difference: 2.39 [-1.82, 6.59] p = 0.27), NYHA (New York Heart Association Functional Class) (Odds ratio: 4.84 [1.00, 23.44] p = 0.05), and significant elevation of quality of life (Mean difference: -5.95 [-9.54, -2.35] p = 0.001) were observed. As the effect of melatonin, fatigue, and NT-Pro BNP were reduced but on the contrary sleep quality, appetite, and FMD (Flow-Mediated Dilation) significantly increased.

      "abstract": "Banana fruit is susceptible to chilling injury (CI) during cold storage, which causes quality deterioration and commodity value decline. Here, the effects of melatonin on CI alleviation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism in postharvest banana were studied. The results displayed that 500 μmol L-1 melatonin treatment effectively inhibited CI development in cold-stored banana during the 96 h of storage. Additionally, lower O2.- productive rate and H2O2 content, but higher contents of ascorbic acid (AsA) and glutathione (GSH) were found in melatonin-treated banana, compared with control fruits. Also, melatonin inhibited the declined activities of antioxidant enzymes. Moreover, a total of 1858 and 330 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between the comparison of CK48h (control bananas at 48 h) and MT48h (melatonin-treated bananas at 48 h), and CK96h (control bananas at 96 h) and MT96h (melatonin-treated bananas at 96 h) through comparative transcriptome analysis of banana fruit, respectively. Further KEGG displayed that DEGs were enriched in secondary metabolites biosynthesis, MAPK signaling pathway-plant and plant hormone signal transduction. The transcriptome expression profiling and RT-qPCR exhibited melatonin treatment improved the expressions of antioxidant enzyme genes (MaSOD, MaCAT, MaAPX and MaGR) but inhibited the expression of ROS production gene (MaRBOH). Collectively, these findings provide a comprehensive view of ROS metabolism associated with the melatonin-alleviated CI in cold-stored banana fruit."
