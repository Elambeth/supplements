      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity is a chronic metabolic disease, mainly caused by excessive/abnormal fat accumulation, as well as accompanied by endotoxemia and chronic inflammation. Quercetin, a natural flavonoid, may alleviate obesity by regulating gut microbiota and metabolites, but its exact mechanism for improving obesity is unknown. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of quercetin on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity in mice. In particular, we focused on the regulatory effects of quercetin on gut microbiota and the tryptophan metabolite indole-3-propionic acid (IPA). METHODS: The C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a 20-week HFD feeding regimen with concurrent daily oral administration of quercetin or IPA. The body weight, fat accumulation, gut barrier function, and chronic inflammation were determined. Gut microbiota composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing and IPA levels were measured in serum and feces. In vitro experiments, Caco-2 cells were used to evaluate the effects of IPA and fecal dilutions from quercetin-treated mice on tight junction protein expression and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation. RESULTS: Our results revealed that quercetin supplementation significantly mitigated obesity and chronic inflammation, and improved the disrupted gut barrier function through the actvation of AhR/interleukin 22 (IL-22) pathway. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that quercetin treatment increased the abundance of Lactobacillus. Quercetin intervention increased the levels of IPA in the serum and feces of mice. IPA supplementation alleviated obesity and chronic inflammation, and enhanced intestinal barrier function through AhR activation. The findings were further corroborated by Caco-2 cell experiment, which indicated that the modulation of the dysregulated gut microbiota to change microbial metabolite IPA coordinated the improvement effect of quercetin on gut barrier disruption. CONCLUSION: Quercetin supplementation alleviates obesity by restoring high-fat diet induced gut microbiota disorder, which elevates IPA level to activate AhR/IL-22 pathway, thereby enhancing intestinal barrier integrity and suppressing chronic inflammation."

      "abstract": "Obesity induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) is a growing global health concern, often linked to numerous metabolic and respiratory disorders. This study investigates the impact of a maternal HFD on the respiratory physiology of adult offspring, emphasizing the potential for fetal programming to exacerbate airway responsiveness. Adult male offspring from dams fed a HFD or a control diet during gestation were submitted to ventilatory mechanical analysis following bronchoconstrictor and bronchodilator challenge. Offspring from the HFD group demonstrated increased body weight, elevated blood glucose levels, heightened airway responsiveness to methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction, and impaired bronchodilator efficacy compared to controls. These findings underscore the potential long-term impact of maternal nutrition on offspring respiratory health. The study also highlights the necessity of identifying critical therapeutic targets for managing respiratory dysfunction in populations exposed to maternal obesity, intending to improve treatment outcomes and prevent related respiratory complications."

      "abstract": "Obesity and depression are likely to co-occur. However, there are few reports on the relationship between obesity and depression. We aimed to investigate the effect of high-fat diet combined with chronic restraint stress on depressive-like behaviors, focusing on the phenotypic transformation of astrocytes. Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into four equal groups: control, high-fat diet (HFD), chronic restraint stress (CRS) and HFD + CRS groups. They were subjected to an 8-week high-fat diet and 3-week restraint stress stimulation. In vitro, palmitic acid (PA) and corticosterone (Cort) were used to mimic HFD and CRS respectively on C8-D1A astrocytes. Our results showed that HFD aggravates anxiety and depression-like behaviors and learning and memory deficits induced by CRS, as reflected by sucrose preference, forced swimming test, tail suspension tests, open field test and the Morris water maze. The expression level of C3 protein in the hippocampus of the mice in the HFD + CRS group was three times that of the CON group. HFD combined with CRS significantly inhibited the protein expression of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Consistent with the results of animal experiments, the results of the in vitro experiments showed that the protein expressions of A1 astrocytes marker in C8-D1A astrocytes were much higher in the PA + Cort group. And the protein expressions the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway-associated proteins were obviously lower in the PA + Cort group. Furthermore, Wnt/β-catenin pathway agonist SKL2001 treatment decreased the A1 astrocytes marker expressions in C8-D1A astrocytes, and improves the anxiety and depression-like behaviors and learning and memory deficits in HFD mice combined with CRS. This study suggested that HFD combined with CRS could promote the transformation of astrocytes into A1 type and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway may be involved in this process.",

      "abstract": "The growing prevalence of obesity is being increasingly acknowledged as a major public health issue. This mainly stems from the excessive intake of dietary fats. Dendrobium officinale (DO), recognized as an herb with dual roles of food and medicine, is renowned for its diverse health-promoting effects. Nevertheless, the specifics of its antiobesity and anti-inflammatory properties and the underlying mechanisms are still obscure. The present study shows that treatment with Dendrobium officinale extract (DOE) alleviates obesity, liver steatosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress in rats that are obese due to a high-fat diet (HFD). Firstly, with respect to HFD obese rats, higher doses of DOE significantly reduced TG, TC, LDL-C, blood glucose, and liver AST and ALT, along with lipid droplets. Meanwhile, DOE supplementation significantly reduced oxidative stress induced by ROS and MDA and increased the levels of GSH-Px and SOD in liver tissues. Furthermore, integrated analysis of transcriptomic and microbiomic data revealed that DOE modulated inflammatory responses through the NF-κB/IκB pathway. This regulatory mechanism was evidenced by corresponding changes in the protein expression levels of both NF-κB and IκB. Additionally, DOE was found to modulate gut microbiota composition in obese rats, specifically reducing the relative abundance of Bilophila while increasing beneficial bacterial populations, particularly the genera Akkermansia and Roseburia. These findings suggest that DOE may help retain the homeostasis of the gut microbiota and improve metabolic health by regulating inflammation in the liver and intestine, thereby providing protection against obesity and related metabolic syndromes. Our study demonstrates that DOE, as a natural botanical extract, can effectively facilitate the prevention or treatment of metabolic syndrome through precision dietary interventions."

      "abstract": "Resveratrol (RSV) is a natural ingredient used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. However, the antidiabetic mechanism of RSV is not clear. In the present study the antidiabetic mechanism of RSV was investigated using mice with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance (IR). C57BL/6J mice were divided into the following three groups: Control (CON), HFD, and HFD + RSV (RSV, 100 mg/kg body weight/day). Mice were administered RSV for 6 weeks; then biochemical and histological parameters, as well as gene and protein expression were detected. Compared with the CON group, the circulating levels of blood glucose, insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and area under the glucose curve were increased (P<0.05), the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index was decreased (P<0.05), and lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle was increased in the HFD group. RSV treatment was able to reverse this process and promote the IRS-1/PI3K/AKT/GLUT4 signaling pathway. Moreover, DNA damage-inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4) expression was upregulated, while the expression levels of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase were downregulated in the HFD + RSV group compared with the HFD group (P<0.05). Cell experiments inhibiting DDIT4 or activating mTOR also confirmed the role of these pathways. In summary, RSV ameliorated IR and glucose as well as lipid metabolism, and promoted the IRS-1/PI3K/AKT/GLUT4 signaling pathway through the DDIT4/mTOR signaling pathway in mice with HFD-induced IR."

A positive correlation has been observed between the intake of dietary fat and the development of CRC. The composition of gut microbiota exhibits a significant correlation with pathophysiologic processes in intestine. Clinical treatment remains inadequate due to the complex pathogenic mechanisms of CRC triggered by a high-fat diet (HFD). Naringenin, a flavonoid from grapefruit, has anti-cancer activity. Our findings suggest that naringenin enhances gut microbiota diversity by increasing the abundance of beneficial bacterial species while reducing opportunistic pathogenic bacteria. The fecal microbiota transplantation assay (FMT) demonstrated that the anti-HFD-CRC activity of naringenin depended on the gut microbiota. Furthermore, naringenin antagonized the IL-6/STAT3 pathway. These results suggest that naringenin may be a potential treatment for HFD-CRC.",

The current study aimed to investigate apoptosis/anti-apoptotic markers in the heart tissue of rats fed with a HFD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four male Wistar rats (weighing approximately 180 grams) were randomly divided into three groups (n=8 each group), including the control group (C), the high-fat diet group (HFD), and the high-fat diet + carvacrol group (HFD + Carva). Animals received a standard or HFD to induce obesity for three months. From day 61 to 90 in the HFD+Carva group, carvacrol was injected intraperitoneally (50 mg/kg) every other day. At the end of the study, the heart tissue was examined for pathological changes and the mRNA levels of TNF-α, Bcl2, Bax, and caspase3 in the heart tissue by Real Time-PCR. RESULTS: HFD-induced obesity led to increased TNF-α, caspase-3, and Bax and decreased Bcl-2 expression levels in heart tissue. Furthermore, histopathological changes in intracytoplasmic vacuole accumulation were evident in the HFD-obese animals. Carvacrol treatment significantly decreased the expression of Bax, TNF-α, and caspase-3 and increased the expression of Bcl-2 in heart tissue. CONCLUSION: In the findings, carvacrol was found to decrease the histopathological changes caused by HFD in heart tissue by suppressing the expression of genes involved in the apoptosis pathway."

      "abstract": "The global increase in prevalence of (pre-)diabetes demands immediate intervention strategies. In our earlier work, we demonstrated in vitro antidiabetic potential of a fermented beetroot product (PN39). Here, we examined the impact of PN39 on glucose tolerance and gut microbiota in C57BL/6J male mice and on prediabetic (PD) subjects' stool microbiota. In mice, high-fat diet (HFD) consumption for 9 weeks resulted in hyperglycemia and impaired glucose tolerance (GT) while concomitant consumption of PN39 and HFD (PN39+HFD) prevented GT impairment. Meanwhile, feeding the mice with HFD for 5 weeks to induce PD and later administering them with PN39 for 4 weeks (PD + PN39) neither improved fasting blood glucose nor GT. Relative to control groups, the gut microbiota of both PD mice and humans were characterized by decreased Clostridia UCG-014 and Lactobacilli as well as significantly altered gut microbial carbohydrate metabolism. Feeding PN39 together with HFD preserved Clostridia UCG-014 and Lactobacilli, increased short chain fatty acid production relative to mice fed with HFD only. Treating gut microbiota of PD subjects with PN39 however increased Clostridia UCG-014 and Lactobacilli populations and increased short chain fatty acids concentrations in the stools. In both mice and humans, PN39 treatment rectified the altered microbial carbohydrate metabolism observed in their PD counterparts. This suggests that the gut microbial modulatory effects of PN39 coupled with its capacity to regulate gut microbial glucose metabolism, likely played a role in preventing PD in mice receiving PN39+HFD. Taken together, our results indicate that PN39 could act as a potent antidiabetic functional food for preventing diabetes and its associated dysbiosis."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Leigh syndrome is often caused by Ndufs4 mutations. The Ndufs4 knockout (KO) mouse model recapitulates key disease features, including systemic inflammation, neurodegeneration, and motor deficits. While dietary interventions such as the ketogenic diet show promise in mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction, conflicting results highlight uncertainties regarding its efficacy. Here, we evaluate the therapeutic potential of a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-enriched high-fat diet (HFD) in Ndufs4 KO mice. METHODS: Dietary intervention began at postnatal day 23, with mice receiving either a normal diet (ND) or a HFD enriched with PUFAs. Phenotypic evaluation, including locomotor function, clasping behaviour, and survival, continued until natural death. In a second group of animals, biochemical analyses were conducted after three weeks on the diets, using Western blot to evaluate neurometabolic and inflammatory regulators, flow cytometry to quantify serum inflammation markers, and metabolic profiling to identify alterations in neurometabolism and the neurolipidome. RESULTS: The HFD significantly extended lifespan and improved clasping behaviour in Ndufs4 KO mice but had no effect on locomotor activity or grip strength decline. While whole-brain mTOR (p70S6K1, 4E-BP1) and SIRT1 (PGC1-α, TNF-α) signalling pathways remained unaffected, the diet significantly reduced serum pro-inflammatory markers TNF and IL-6. Furthermore, the PUFA-enriched HFD partially restored disruptions in TCA cycle, ketone body, branched-chain amino acid, and lipid metabolism, indicating potential metabolic reprogramming. CONCLUSION: Dietary interventions, such as a PUFA-enriched HFD, may alleviate systemic inflammation, partially correct metabolic imbalances, and mitigate specific disease phenotypes in Leigh syndrome, warranting further investigation into the underlying mechanisms and broader therapeutic applications."

METHODS AND RESULTS: The effects of supplementation were assessed in C57BL6 mice with MS induced by a high-fat diet. Boiled beans (75 and 150 mg animal day-1) and the SMEE (0.8 and 8 mg animal day-1) were administered daily for 4 months. Weight and glycemia were measured weekly. At the end of the experiment, glycemia, total, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, protein carbonyls, and carboxymethyl lysine (CML) levels were determined in plasma. Oral intake of the SMEE decreased glycemia at the end of the intervention. No statistically significant difference in glycemia was found for the boiled beans compared with controls. The SMEE at 0.8 mg animal day-1 decreased the total amount of CML, mainly in proteins with molecular masses >75 kDa, in agreement with the results for carbonylated proteins. CONCLUSION: The SMEE of Peumo beans reduces glycemia at the end of the intervention and decreases total CML in plasma, suggesting a potential beneficial effect of bean intake. The results obtained in the intervention encourage further studies in Chilean bean landraces."

This plant could attenuate obesity, insulin resistance, and fatty liver in rats fed a high-fat/calorie diet. However, the benefits of C. terminans to the gut remain unknown. We investigated the protective effect of C. terminans extract against gut dysfunction in rats exposed to a high-fat/calorie diet. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were assigned to receive either (1) a normal diet treated with vehicle, (2) a high-fat/calorie diet treated with vehicle, (3) a high-fat/calorie diet treated with 100 mg per kg per day (mg·kg-1·day-1) of C. terminans extract, or (4) a high-fat/calorie diet treated with 200 mg·kg-1·day-1 of C. terminans extract. The rats were euthanized after 12 weeks of treatment to enable feces and colon tissue collection. RESULTS: Both 100 and 200 mg·kg-1·day-1 of C. terminans extract reduced body weight (-10.49%; p = 0.030 and -10.54%; p = 0.037, respectively) and ameliorated gut inflammation, gut barrier disruption, changes in short-chain fatty acid levels, and gut dysbiosis caused by high-fat/calorie diet.

Water (WEP) and ethanolic extracts (EEP) of propolis were administered intraperitoneally to ApoE-/- and C57BL/6J mice modeled with a high-fat diet. Under anesthesia, the animals were euthanized by decapitation, and serum, along with aortic tissues, was collected. Serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), OxLDL and LOX-1 levels, OxLDL levels in aortic tissue homogenate, and subendothelial lipid accumulation levels by histological staining were determined in mice and statistical analyses were performed. WEP and EEP supplementation significantly decreased serum TC, TG, OxLDL, LOX-1, and tissue OxLDL levels and reduced plaque burden in the aortic root, with statistically significant differences observed. Those results suggest that propolis extracts have a potential treatment option for atherosclerosis, as a food supplement or a complementary medical/functional food. However, further research is needed to elucidate their molecular mechanisms, evaluate clinical efficacy and safety, and explore possible synergistic effects with existing atherosclerosis treatments."

      "abstract": "High-fat diets (HFDs) have become increasingly prevalent in modern societies, driving rising rates of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Concurrently, radiation exposure from medical treatments and environmental sources poses health risks shaped by both biological and environmental factors. This review explores the intersection between HFDs and radiation sensitivity/susceptibility, focusing on how diet-induced metabolic alterations influence the body's response to radiation. Evidence from preclinical and clinical studies indicates that HFDs significantly alter metabolism, leading to increased oxidative stress and immune system dysregulation. These metabolic changes can exacerbate radiation-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, and DNA damage, potentially increasing radiation sensitivity in normal tissues. Conversely, obesity and HFD-induced metabolic disruptions may activate cellular pathways involved in DNA repair, cell survival, and inflammatory responses, fostering tumor resistance and modifying the tumor microenvironment, which may impair the efficacy of radiation therapy in cancer treatment. Understanding the interplay between diet and radiation exposure is critical for optimizing public health guidelines and improving therapeutic outcomes. These findings underscore the need for further research into dietary interventions that may mitigate radiation-associated risks."

Polygonatum sibiricum polysaccharide (PSP) is one of the most active ingredients in the Chinese medicine P. sibiricum Redoute with many biological activities. However, its efficacy in alleviating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains unexplored. Our aim is to evaluate the protective effect of PSP against T2DM by measuring body weight and serum biochemical indicators, examining the histopathological images of pancreatic and liver tissues, detecting fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) content, and analyzing the intestinal flora diversity and the microbiota structure in T2DM mice. The findings indicated that PSP treatment in T2DM mice could obviously decrease the fasting blood glucose and fasting insulin levels, ameliorate glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, lipid, and inflammatory factor levels, attenuate pancreatic and liver damage, and increase the fecal SCFA content. In addition, PSP could modulate the composition of gut microbiota in T2DM mice, resulting in the relative abundance of Firmicutes decreasing and that of Bacteroidetes increasing, along with the abundance of beneficial flora significantly increasing, especially SCFA-producing bacteria. The findings indicate that PSP administration protected against diabetes by controlling disordered glucolipid metabolism and modulating the gut microbiota, which provides a valuable strategy for the utilization of PSP to treat T2DM."

In the current study, we first investigated the neuroprotective effects of TG68 on in vitro human models of neuroinflammation and β-amyloid neurotoxicity in order to expand our knowledge of the therapeutic potential of this novel thyromimetic. Subsequently, we examined metabolic and inflammatory profiles, along with cognitive changes, using a high-fat diet (HFD) mouse model of obesity. Our data demonstrated that TG68 was able to prevent either LPS/TNFα-induced inflammatory response or β-amyloid-induced cytotoxicity in human microglial (HMC3) cells. Next, we demonstrated that in HFD-fed mice, treatment with TG68 (10 mg/kg/day; 2 weeks) significantly reduced anxiety-like behavior in stretch-attend posture (SAP) tests while producing a 12% BW loss and a significant decrease in blood glucose and lipid levels. Notably, these data highlight a close relationship between improved serum metabolic parameters and a reduction of anxious behavior. Moreover, TG68 administration was observed to efficiently counteract HFD-altered central and peripheral expressions in mice with selected biomarkers of metabolic dysfunction, inflammation, and neurotoxicity, revealing promising neuroprotective effects. In conclusion, our work provides preliminary evidence that TG68 may represent a novel therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of interlinked diseases such as obesity and neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Given the escalating prevalence of obesity worldwide, identifying efficacious dietary components is crucial. This study investigated whether citrus-derived 5-demethyl-polymethoxyflavones (5-DPMFs) protect against obesity in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed an HFD and supplemented with a citrus-derived powder (CP) containing 5-DPMFs as the main bioactive components. Two doses of CP (0.25% and 1% in the diet) were tested, corresponding to approximately 36 and 145 mg/kg body weight of 5-DPMFs, respectively. Key adipose tissue parameters were assessed, including inflammatory cytokines and browning markers associated with p38 MAPK signaling. Treatment with 5-DPMFs significantly attenuated adipose tissue inflammation, as evidenced by reduced levels of MCP-1, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β. Concurrently, fat browning was enhanced by upregulating thermogenic and mitochondrial proteins. Gut microbiota analysis revealed that 5-DPMFs increased the relative abundance of beneficial probiotic species, such as Lactobacillus and Limosilactobacillus reuteri, which have been linked to improved metabolic profiles. These findings demonstrate that 5-DPMFs mitigate obesity-associated adipose inflammation, promote the browning of white adipose tissue (WAT), and favorably regulate gut microbiota composition in HFD-fed mice. Our results suggest that 5-DPMFs could serve as a functional food ingredient for obesity prevention and management."

      "abstract": "Abnormal lipid metabolism is an independent risk factor for kidney injury, significantly altering the associated gene expression, particularly in single kidney models. This study investigates the impact of high-fat diet-induced lipid metabolism on podocyte injury in uninephrectomized mice. Using targeted lipidomics analysis and podocyte-specific assays, the modification of lipid profiles attributed to a high-fat diet and the development of podocyte injury caused by lipid metabolism in mice that underwent unilateral nephrectomy were examined. Mice that underwent unilateral nephrectomy and were fed with a high-fat diet for 13 weeks exhibited progressive renal dysfunction, including the accumulation of lipid droplets in podocytes, vacuolization of tubular cells, and glomerular hypertrophy. Liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry confirmed a significant increase in cholesteryl ester 20:4 levels in the podocytes of these mice. In vitro, cholesteryl ester 20:4 treatment reduced mitochondrial respiration capacity and mitochondrial glycolysis in podocytes. Furthermore, the treatment led to alterations in the protein expression levels associated with lipid metabolism and transport, mitochondrial activity, and autophagy, including ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 A (CPT1A), acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), nuclear respiratory factor ½ (NRF½), dynamin-1-like protein (DRP1), and p62. Transcriptome sequencing analysis revealed impaired gene expression, which was associated with the progression of renal fibrosis in unilateral nephrectomy mice with a high-fat diet. Specifically, the expression of matrix metalloproteinases and collagen genes, including fibronectin and collagen IV, was upregulated, indicating fibrosis progression. In conclusion, lipidomics analysis identifies cholesteryl ester 20:4 as a key lipid metabolite accumulating in podocytes, which is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and abnormal autophagy. This accumulation potentially contributes to structural and functional deterioration in the kidney and highlights its role in kidney damage and its potential as a therapeutic target in metabolic kidney diseases."

      "abstract": "Excessive intake of dietary fats is strongly associated with an increased risk of various chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, hepatic metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease, chronic intestinal inflammation, and certain cancers. A significant portion of the adverse effects of high-fat diet on disease risk is mediated through modifications in the gut microbiota. Specifically, high-fat diets are linked to reduced microbial diversity, an overgrowth of gram-negative bacteria, an elevated Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio, and alterations at various taxonomic levels. These microbial alterations influence the intestinal metabolism of small molecules, which subsequently increases intestinal permeability, exacerbates inflammatory responses, disrupts metabolic functions, and impairs signal transduction pathways in the host. Consequently, diet-induced changes in the gut microbiota play a crucial role in the initiation and progression of chronic diseases. This review explores the relationship between high-fat diets and gut microbiota, highlighting their roles and underlying mechanisms in the development of chronic metabolic diseases. Additionally, we propose probiotic interventions may serve as a promising adjunctive therapy to counteract the negative effects of high-fat diet-induced alterations in gut microbiota composition.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity is a growing global epidemic associated with changes in the gut microenvironment and metabolic endotoxemia, which can exacerbate metabolic and inflammatory processes. Citral (CT), a monoterpene present in essential oils, has been investigated for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory properties. However, its role in modulating the gut axis during metabolic and inflammatory alterations in obesity remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of CT on intestinal and metabolic impairment induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and high-fat diet (HFD) in in vitro and in vivo models. METHODS: Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a standard diet and HFD for 17 weeks, with daily oral administration of CT treatment (25, 100, or 300 mg/kg) or vehicle. Morphological and histological parameters, lipid profiles, adipose index, cytokine levels, and colonic gene expression were determined. In vitro, murine rectal carcinoma (CMT-93) cells were stimulated with LPS (10 μg/mL) to assess tight junction and inflammatory protein expression. RESULTS: CT treatment showed anti-obesity activity against HFD-induced body mass gain in mice, which was attributed to a significant reduction in body fat, glycemia, and cholesterol levels. Systemic inflammation during obesity also decreased after CT treatment, with a significant reduction in serum levels of endotoxin, interleukin-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α. Additionally, CT stimulation reduced inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and maintained ZO-1 levels in LPS-stimulated CMT-93 cells. CONCLUSION: CT has anti-obesogenic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-hyperlipidemic properties mediated by its protective effects on the intestinal epithelium in obesity. Thus, our results highlight the promising preclinical results of CT treatment as a protective agent against the detrimental effects of HFD and LPS in mice."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into a T2DM group fed a HFD and a normal group (NOR group) fed normal chow. After 6 w, the T2DM group was confirmed to have impaired glucose tolerance and was intraperitoneally injected with a single small dose of streptozotocin (STZ, 30 mg/kg), and blood glucose levels were monitored. The HFD was maintained for another 6 w, and an Evans blue assay and a dark-adapted electroretinogram (ERG) were conducted. Rat retinas were collected for morphology analysis, TMT proteomics analysis, and Western blotting. The expression patterns of selected differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were validated in rat retinas via Western blotting and in aqueous humor from NPDR patients via slot blotting. RESULTS: After the 12-w HFD and STZ injection, the rats presented typical symptoms of T2DM. The retinas of T2DM rats presented pathological features of NPDR, including compromised scotopic ERGs, thinning of retinal layers, increased apoptosis and vascular leakage in the retina. Proteomic analysis identified DEPs and revealed profound dyslipidemia in T2DM rat retinas. The significant upregulation of the FABP3, TINAGL1, and COL4A3 proteins was validated in the retinas of the rats by Western blotting and in the aqueous humor of the NPDR patients by slot blotting. CONCLUSION: In a rat model of HFD-induced T2DM that is consistent with the natural history and pathological features of NPDR, proteomics and bioinformatics analyses identified FABP3, TINAGL1, and COL4A3 as the 3 key upregulated proteins in retinas for the first time. These findings are supported by technical and clinical validations and provide novel targets for NPDR intervention.",

In this study, two main polysaccharides components with different molecular weights were isolated (PCP40 with 1000 kDa and PCP80 with 10 kDa, PCPs) and their anti-obesity effects were evaluated and compared. Results showed that PCPs could correct the abnormity of lipid and sugar metabolism, indicating by the decreased level of body weight, white fat weight, adipocyte size, serum lipid as well as the recovery of leptin resistance and insulin resistance in high-fat diet (HFD) mice. PCP40 exerted more remarkable lipid lowering effects than PCP80, which might due to its higher fat binding and pancreatic lipase inhibition capacity that inhibit lipid absorption, and the more active lipolysis activity. On the other hand, PCPs improved intestinal microecology and alleviate chronic inflammation in HFD mice. PCPs could promote SCFAs production and recover gut hypoxic condition through repairing the function of mitochondria. This changed condition also led to the increase of bacterial variety and distinct bacteria enrichment, such as Paracteroides goldsteinii (PCP40) and Lactobacillus (PCP80). These findings suggested PCPs, especially the high molecular component PCP40, had a promising anti-obesity effect."

Through fermentation of dietary fibers, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) act as host energy sources and signaling molecules via G protein-coupled receptors such as GPR41. Acidipropionibacterium acidipropionici is widely used in many applications; however, in vivo studies on the beneficial effect of A. acidipropionici via propionate production and host energy homeostasis are unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the beneficial metabolic effects of A. acidipropionici by focusing on GPR41 signaling in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity mouse model. Here, we demonstrated that A. acidipropionici OB7439 improved host metabolism in HFD-induced obesity in mice. The intake of A. acidipropionici OB7439 improved metabolism in HFD-induced obese mice by increasing propionate production, regulating glucose tolerance, and inhibiting hepatic inflammation via GPR41 signaling. Our findings shed light on the potential of using A. acidipropionici OB7439 as an SCFA producer for the prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders. Based on these results, we suggest that A. acidipropionici may be a potential therapeutic bacterium that inhibits obesity and modulates the gut microbial community."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High-fat diet (HFD) was suggested to be associated with several retinal diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy (DR). Nevertheless, our understanding of the mechanisms governing retinal lipid metabolic homeostasis remains limited, with little attention focused on the influence of HFD on different retinal cell types. To address this gap, we established a high-fat model using mice fed with HFD for a duration of 6 months. Then, we conducted a comparative analysis of the retinal lipidome and proteome between normal diet (ND) and HFD-fed mice to explore the impacts of HFD on retinal lipid metabolism and gene expression network. Furthermore, we also investigated the impacts of HFD on retina in single-cell resolution by single-cell transcriptome sequencing. RESULTS: We found that a long-term HFD significantly altered the lipid composition of the retina, with a dramatically elevated cholesterylesters (CE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) level and a decreased eicosanoid level. Proteomic analysis revealed that the primary bile acid biosynthesis pathway was over-activated in HFD retinas. By using single-cell transcriptome analysis, we identified different regulation of gene expression in MG and rod cells in a high-fat environment, whereas the previously identified activation of the bile acid synthesis pathway was predominantly found in MG cells, and may be regulated by alternative pathways of bile acid synthesis, suggesting the critical roles of MG cells in retinal lipid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, by multi-omics studies, we unveiled that HFD leading to the development of retinal diseases may be regulated by alternative pathways of bile acid synthesis, and our study will shed light on the treatment of these diseases.",

      "abstract": "Epidemiological studies demonstrated relationships between gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) and metabolic syndrome (MetS). We aimed to clarify mechanism underlying their relationship. To investigate whether systemic inflammation against high-fat diet (HFD)-related dysbiosis promotes Warburg effect in tumors at the squamo-columnar junction (SCJ), we applied K19-Wnt1/C2mE (Gan) mice, fed either HFD or control diet ± acidic bile salts (ABS) with/without clodronate liposomes (CLs), and in vitro studies using MKN7 cells with/without THP1-derived macrophages. Then, we assessed involvement of oxidative stress (OS) in Warburg effect by comparing between nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) knockout-Gan mice and Gan mice. Tumors with macrophage infiltration in HFD+ABS group were larger than in Control group. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis revealed enhancement of the OS signaling in tumor of HFD+ABS group. HFD+ABS group mice demonstrated induction of OS, Nqo1, TNFα, and Warburg effect in tumors and mucosal barrier dysfunction of dysbiotic gut. All of them were abolished with diminishing macrophage infiltration by additional CLs treatment. Stimulation with TNFα, but not ABS nor lipopolysaccharide, on MKN7 cells activated Warburg effect. In MKN7 cells co-cultured with the macrophages whose TNFa expression was induced by the lipopolysaccharide pretreatment, Warburg effect was enhanced in the TNFα concentration-dependent manners. In Nrf2 knockout-Gan mice, tumors shrank with reducing OS, TNFα, and Warburg effect, along with decreasing macrophage infiltration. Accordingly, MetS may develop GCA through the Nrf2-related Warburg effect under the TNFα stimulation from the macrophages activated by both local ABS exposure and systemic lipopolysaccharide exposure from leaky gut with HFD-related dysbiosis."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Central precocious puberty (CPP) is a common pediatric endocrine disorder and a significant global public health concern. Emerging evidence suggests an association between bile acids (BAs) and CPP, although their regulatory roles and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. METHODS: We conducted untargeted metabolomics and targeted BA analysis on serum samples from female rats with high-fat diet-induced CPP to identify metabolites potentially involved in regulating puberty through modulation of Sirt1 and Kiss1 expression in the hypothalamus. Identified BAs were then administered via gavage to female rats with CPP to assess their effects. To explore the mechanisms by which these BAs affect the development of CPP, gut microbiota and their metabolites were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics. RESULTS: Our findings revealed significant reductions in glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA) and glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) levels in female rats with CPP. GDCA treatment delayed the onset of puberty, accompanied by alterations in the gut microbiota functions and metabolic pathways related to oxidative stress (OS) and fatty acid metabolism. Mediation analysis suggested that OS-related metabolites, including gamma-glutamylcysteine and malonic acid, which increased with the abundance of Lachnospiraceae UCG-001, facilitated the reduction of Sirt1 expression. Additionally, pregnenolone appeared to suppress the beneficial effect of Parasutterella in enhancing Sirt1 expression. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that GDCA exhibits a potential therapeutic effect on CPP through a unique mechanism that involves gut microbiota modulation, alterations in serum metabolites, and changes in the expression of key regulatory factors Sirt1.",

      "abstract": "Metabolic disorders and brain insulin resistance (IR) are major risk factors for the development of neurodegenerative conditions. Kumquat fruit (KF) administration has demonstrated significant anti-dysmetabolic effects, improving peripheral IR in murine models of metabolic syndrome. Along these lines, this study evaluated the neuroprotective effects of KF supplementation in a model of dysmetabolism-induced neuronal damage and its ability to counteract the disruption of brain insulin signalling. To this end, biochemical and histological analysis assessed neuroapoptosis, disruption of brain insulin signalling and neuroinflammation in a model of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced neuronal damage. Our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that KF supplementation significantly counteracts HFD-induced neuroapoptosis downregulating pro-apoptotic genes (FAS-L, BIM and P27) and upregulating the anti-apoptotic ones (BDNF and BCL-2). Coherently, KF positively influenced the expression of selected genes related to Alzheimer's Disease. Relevantly, these effects were associated to KF ability to restore brain insulin signalling by increasing insulin receptor expression, reducing IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, enhancing both AKT activation and GSK-3β inactivation. Accordingly, KF suppressed HFD-neuroinflammation, counteracting the overexpression of NF-κB and its downstream enzymatic products, iNOS and COX-2. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the neuroprotective benefits of KF administration, supporting its potential as a dietary intervention for dysmetabolic-related neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "abstract": "The modern diet contains a substantial level of fat which is believed to be one of the leading causes of the progression of kidney disease. Several studies have already demonstrated that consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) induces inflammation and oxidative stress, causing activation of upstream mechanisms associated with kidney injury. For the prevention of such pathological events, a change in diet or the taking of nutritional supplements are recommended as alternative treatments. One of the forms of vitamin B6, pyridoxine (PN), has been shown to be an effective antioxidant and can also inhibit the formation of advanced-glycation end products (AGEs). In this study, the protective effects of PN (100 mg/kg/day for a period of eight weeks) against HFD-induced complications in obese rats were investigated. Rats fed on a HFD developed obesity which promoted inflammation, glucose intolerance, AGE receptor upregulation, oxidative stress, and kidney dysfunction. Intervention using PN mitigated obesity-related events and the impairment of kidney function by markedly reducing oxidative stress and also restoring the activity of antioxidant enzymes. Other studies have shown that some vitamin B6 derivatives inhibit the formation of AGEs but our study shows for the first time that PN exerted an antiglycative effect in this HFD-induced obesity model. Consequently, PN could potentially be a novel supplement for obese individuals to avoid kidney injury."

      "abstract": "As industrialization and societal development accelerate, various organisms, including humans, are exposed to environmental hazards, such as zinc (Zn) and high-fat diet (HFD). These widespread exposures pose significant threats to public health; however, the combined effects and underlying mechanisms of these environmental factors on lipotoxicity remain unclear. In this study, the yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco) was used as a model to investigate the impact of different Zn levels and HFD coexposure on hepatic lipotoxicity. The results indicated that low concentrations of Zn (L-Zn) significantly reduced hepatic lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress compared to HFD-only treatment, while high concentrations of Zn (H-Zn) exacerbated these effects. Mechanistically, L-Zn alleviated ER stress by scavenging H2O2 and O2•- within the ER via the MTF-1/GPx7 pathway. Glutathione peroxidase 7 (GPx7), an ER-resident antioxidant enzyme, played a crucial role in mitigating ER stress and lipotoxicity, with metal-responsive transcription factor 1 (MTF-1) identified as its regulator. This study is the first to demonstrate the dual role of Zn in hepatic lipotoxicity, revealing the Zn2+/MTF-1/GPx7 axis as a key modulator of ER stress and lipid metabolism. These findings highlight the importance of considering combined environmental exposures in public health and environmental risk assessments.",

Chlorogenic acid (CA) is a common dietary antioxidant known for its ability to modulate metabolic homeostasis. This study aimed to investigate the impact of CA on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic disorder in skeletal muscle. C57BL/6J mice fed with a HFD were treated with CA for 12 weeks. The study assessed the overall glycolipid metabolic status, exercise performance, muscle fiber type, and antioxidant capacity of skeletal muscle in HFD-fed mice treated with CA. Results showed that CA reduced fat accumulation, improved exercise capacity, and enhanced mitochondrial performance in HFD-fed mice. Untargeted metabolomics analysis revealed that lactate metabolism and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) responded positively to CA intervention. Molecular mechanisms demonstrated that CA intervention improved mitochondrial biogenesis and function, promoting FAO and oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria and ultimately reducing fat deposition in skeletal muscle induced by HFD feeding. Mechanistically, CA decreased HFD-induced lactate production and protein lactylation in skeletal muscle, highlighting the importance of the LDHA-lactate axis in mitochondrial function improvement by CA. Therefore, this study provides additional insights supporting the potential of CA as a natural dietary supplement for metabolic syndrome and associated disorders.",

      "abstract": "Background Chronic high-fat diets (HFDs) lead to an imbalance of calcium homeostasis in cardiomyocytes, which contributes to the development of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, dilated cardiomyopathy, and other cardiovascular diseases. Aloe-emodin (AE) is an anthraquinone component isolated from aloe, rhubarb, and cassia seed, having cardiovascular protective, hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and other pharmacological effects. Objective This study aimed to explore the specific role of AE in obesity/hyperlipidemia-induced myocardial intracellular calcium homeostasis imbalance. Methods Wistar rats (male, 220 ± 20 g) were fed HFD for four weeks and AE (100 mg/kg) was administrated for six weeks after confirmation of the HFD model. Serum lipids, reactive oxygen species levels, malondialdehyde levels, and superoxide dismutase levels were measured by commercial biochemical kits. Electrocardiograms of rats were recorded with the BL-420F biological function experimental system. Calcium transients and resting intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were determined by the Langendorff-perfused heart model. Protein levels of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), and cardiac Ca2+ handling proteins were evaluated by western blot analysis. Results HFD-induced hearts exhibited a reduced amplitude of Ca2+ transients and increased resting levels of [Ca2+] in the heart; AE treatment significantly improved these parameters. Furthermore, the HFD-induced heart showed downregulation of PRMT1, upregulation of CaMKII, and abnormalities in the levels of Ca2+ handling proteins. All these deleterious changes were significantly suppressed by the AE treatment. Moreover, AE treatment prevented palmitic acid (PA)-induced calcium overload in H9C2 cells; this effect was reduced by the application of an inhibitor of PRMT1. Conclusion Taken together, this study demonstrates that AE could alleviate HFD/PA-induced myocardial intracellular calcium homeostasis imbalance via the PRMT1/CaMKII signaling pathway."

Obesity is accompanied by an ecological imbalance in the gut microbiota, so it is of great significance to intervene in male infertility caused by obesity from the perspective of gut microbiota metabolites. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of butyrate in ameliorating obesity-induced spermatogenic dysfunction and to explore the potential molecular mechanisms. METHODS: This study explored the role of butyrate in recovering the dysfunctions of spermatogenesis caused by obesity by inducing an obese model of male mice with a high-fat diet (HFD). The effects of HFD and butyrate on testicular function were explored based on metabolomics. RESULTS: The results of the study showed that HFD caused a decrease in sperm count, a decrease in sperm motility, and an increase in sperm malformation rate in mice. After adding butyrate to the HFD, the various sperm indicators of mice were significantly improved. Through the analysis of metabolomics data from mouse testes, this study found that an HFD significantly altered the metabolic status of mice testes, involving multiple metabolic pathways. However, after adding butyrate, some metabolic characteristics tended to be similar to those of normal diet mice, and the steroid biosynthesis and primary bile acid biosynthesis pathways were significantly improved. CONCLUSIONS: This study clarified the effect of butyrate on improving sperm quality, providing experimental evidence for the treatment of obesity-induced abnormal spermatogenesis with butyrate."

Exercise can improve overall metabolic health, and it exerts a positive impact on local inflammation. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate existing evidence and analyze the effects of exercise intervention on the behavior, inflammatory factors, glial cells, and feeding neurons of animals with HFD-induced hypothalamic inflammation. We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, Ebsco, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases from database establishment to July 2024 to identify all animal studies on exercise intervention in HFD-induced hypothalamic inflammation. Two researchers independently conducted literature screening to determine inclusion in the study. Finally, SYRCLE's risk of bias tool for animal studies was used to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. A total of 11 studies were included. Among them, 10 studies used mice and 1 study used rabbits. Overall, the inclusion of research supported the improvement of behavior, inflammatory factors, glial cells, and feeding neurons in animals with HFD-induced hypothalamic inflammation through exercise. However, 2 studies did not find significant changes in food intake and body weight, and 4 studies found that exercise intervention reduced the expression of anti-inflammatory factors (IL- 10 and SOCS3). Different exercise programs, such as forced and voluntary exercise, may be potential reasons for the differences in outcomes. On the basis of existing evidence, exercise appeared to be a potential protective and preventive factor against HFD-induced hypothalamic inflammation. However, the inconsistent results suggest that further research is needed in the future to thoroughly elucidate the mechanisms by which exercise improves and prevents hypothalamic inflammation."

Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either an HFD or a normal chow diet, with some groups exposed to microplastics alone or in combination with melatonin. Male pups were evaluated on postnatal day 7. Results indicated that pups in the HFD-microplastics group (HFD-Mi) exhibited increased liver lipid accumulation (observed in histological staining), apoptosis (elevated cleaved caspase 3, phospho-AKT, and TUNEL staining), inflammation (higher IL- 6 and TNF-α), and oxidative stress (elevated malondialdehyde). Conversely, melatonin treatment (HFD-Mi + M) significantly reduced these effects, including lipid accumulation, apoptosis, and inflammation, while enhancing antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase activity and improving lipid metabolism (reduced SREBP- 1 expression). These findings suggest that prenatal melatonin mitigates liver injury caused by maternal HFD and microplastics through its anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and lipid-regulating properties, underscoring its potential hepatoprotective role."

Lactiplantibacillus plantarum ZDY2013, a probiotic capable of metabolizing various oligosaccharides, serves as a potent regulator of intestinal mucosal immunity. In this study, we investigated the potential ameliorative effects of xylooligosaccharides combined with L. plantarum ZDY2013 (synbiotic) on T2DM-induced intestinal injury and explored the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that synbiotic improved glucose metabolism, reduced lipid accumulation, and alleviated insulin resistance in T2DM rats. Moreover, synbiotic outperformed L. plantarum ZDY2013 alone in restoring intestinal barrier integrity by suppressing oxidative stress and intestinal inflammation, while significantly enhancing the colonization of L. plantarum ZDY2013 and altering the abundance of key bacterial genera. Interestingly, synbiotic treatment also increased the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which were strongly associated with specific bacterial taxa. Furthermore, gut microbiota-derived SCFAs were confirmed to ameliorate insulin resistance by promoting glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis in IR-HepG2 cells. Collectively, these findings suggest the potential use of synbiotics as a clinical intervention to ameliorate T2DM. This study provides a rationale for exploring dietary approaches as a mitigating strategy for managing long-standing diabetes."

      "abstract": "Obesity has emerged as a critical global health challenge in recent decades, driving increased scientific interest in honey as a sugar alternative. Despite its perceived nutritional benefits, the inherent high fructose-glucose ratio in honey continues to raise concerns regarding metabolic implications for overweight individuals. In this study, Amur linden honey (LH) was evaluated as a low-glycemic-index (GI) dietary intervention, demonstrating significant anti-obesity effects through murine model. Subsequently, nine principal polyphenols (PC) were identified by metabolomics and proven anti-obesity activity in cellular assays, suggesting their potential role in mediating the biological effects of LH. Notably, the anti-obesity effects of LH were more pronounced as compared to the equivalent amount of glucose and fructose, and this effect was further facilitated by addition of the PC. Furthermore, LH and HP (LH with the addition of PC) attenuate obesity by modulating gut microbiota, promoting production of SCFA especially acetate and propionate etc., and activating the AMPK/PI3K/AKT pathways. The present study revealed that LH, enriched with diverse bioactive compounds, presents the potential to be a healthy and safe sugar substitutes due to its positive effects on the obesity."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Sphingolipid metabolism has been implicated in many diseases including cancer, pathologic inflammation, viral infection, neurologic pathologies and metabolic pathologies, including obesity and diabetes. We have previously shown that opaganib (aka ABC294640) inhibits three key enzymes in the sphingolipid metabolism pathway: sphingosine kinase-2, dihydroceramide desaturase and glucosylceramide synthase. We and others have demonstrated anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities of opaganib in multiple experimental models. Furthermore, opaganib has been studied in clinical trials with patients having cancer or severe Covid-19. In the present studies, the effects of opaganib in the well-established model of High-Fat Diet (HFD)-induced obesity have been studied. METHODS: Male or female C57BL/6 mice were fed Control Diet (CD) or HFD and treated with vehicle or opaganib by oral gavage once daily, 5 days per week. Body weights were monitored and glucose tolerance was measured periodically for up to 16 weeks. In some experiments, obese HFD-fed mice were treated with vehicle, opaganib alone, semaglutide alone or opaganib plus semaglutide. RESULTS: Treatment with opaganib markedly suppressed weight gain in male mice fed the HFD but not in mice given the CD. Compared with mice given CD, mice on the HFD demonstrated poor glucose tolerance at 8, 12 and 16 weeks, consistent with the progression of obesity. Importantly, opaganib treatment of the HFD-fed mice abolished this developing glucose intolerance at all times of measurement. Opaganib treatment also reduced the elevation of hemoglobin A1c and the deposition of inguinal fat in HFD-fed mice. Similar results were obtained with female mice, indicating equivalent efficacy of opaganib in both sexes. Additionally, opaganib and semaglutide were equally effective in promoting body weight loss and improving glucose tolerance in obese mice. Opaganib administered either concurrently with semaglutide or as a single drug following cessation of semaglutide treatment eliminated weight rebound. CONCLUSION: Overall, the data indicate that opaganib effectively suppresses the loss of metabolic control in mice on HFD, suggesting that opaganib may be useful alone or in combination with existing therapies for weight management and improve conditions associated with obesity and diabetes."

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The findings presented here were obtained from a bioequivalence study, in which individuals were randomly assigned to consume Ondansetron hydrochloride tablets either following a meal or subsequent to a high-fat diet containing 978.6 kcal, with 54.6% of the calories derived from fat. The plasma concentrations of Ondansetron were measured through the utilization of high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) after collecting blood samples. For the computation of pharmacokinetic parameters, the non-compartmental module from Phoenix WinNonlin Version 8.2 was utilized Additionally, the BE module within WinNonLin was utilized to statistically analyze key pharmacokinetic metrics, including the maximum level of concentration (Cmax), the area beneath the concentration-time curve spanning from zero to the final quantifiable time point (AUC0-t), and the area beneath the concentration-time curve extending from zero to a theoretical limitless point (AUC0-∞) in plasma. A total of 53 healthy subjects participated in the study and were divided into a fasted cohort and a postprandial cohort. RESULTS: Ondansetron had lower Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞in plasma when taken with food compared to when taken on an empty stomach, with the 90% confidence interval falling outside the acceptable range of 80.00%-125.00%.The occurrence of treatment-related side effects was comparable in both the fasted and postprandial groups, as was the incidence of adverse drug reactions. CONCLUSION: The study concluded that the high-fat meal had a notable impact on how Ondansetron is processed in the body. Healthy subjects tolerated all treatments well and safely under both postprandial and fasted conditions.

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of LJF on liver injury in rats with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD. The administration of LJF extract to rats with HFD-induced NAFLD significantly improved their body weight and daily food intake, liver tissue steatosis, lipid droplet vacuolization, and inflammatory cell infiltration. In addition, the LJF extract also improved to varying degrees the serum biochemical parameters, liver lipid content, levels of inflammatory factors, and oxidative stress markers. Among the treatment groups, the LJF high-dose group (LJF-H) showed the most significant improvement effect. Additionally, the correlation matrix heatmap visualization indicated that LJF may ameliorate NAFLD mainly by lowering liver lipid content and improving serum biochemical parameters."

Hydrogen-rich water (HRW) possesses therapeutic antioxidant properties that may help offer protection to sperm. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of HRW on spermatogenesis dysfunction in rats with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. In this experiment, thirty male Wistar Albino rats were divided into three groups. 1) Control group: fed a normal diet, 2) Obese group: fed a HFD (45 % fat), and 3) HFD + HRW group: fed a high-fat diet and received HRW. HRW (1.5 mM) was administered orally every day. After 16 weeks, blood and tissue samples (testis and epididymis) were collected for biochemical and histopathological analysis. Serum LH, FSH and testosterone and oxidative and antioxidative markers, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and total thiol groups were measured in testis and epididymal tissues. The results showed that the HFD significantly increased food intake, body weight, and lee index, all of which were reduced in the HRW-treated obese group. Testis weight, sperm count, Serum LH and histological evaluation of testis including Sertoli and spermatogonia cell counts were significantly lower in the obese group but improved with HRW treatment. Additionally, HRW treatment increased the luminal diameter of seminiferous tubules, epididymal epithelia height, tissue SOD, and total thiol levels, while reducing MDA level in the testis. This study showed that administration of HRW can improve spermatogenesis in obese animals by reducing oxidative stress and ameliorating histological changes in the testis and epididymis, suggesting its potential benefits in combating high-fat diet-induced reproductive dysfunction."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most characteristic form of liver diseases. As the member of MAPK family, the cJun-N-terminal-kinase (JNK) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of MASLD. A small molecule compound, J27, has demonstrated strong anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting JNK phosphorylation, but its therapeutic potential in MASLD remains unclear. METHODS: To evaluate the effect of J27, we used a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced MASLD mouse model with or without J27 treatment. Pathological changes were assessed through tissue staining, biochemical analysis, and other assays. In vitro, J27's effects were tested on macrophages, hepatocytes, and co-culture systems under palmitic acid stimulation. RESULTS: J27 significantly reduced HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, liver injury, insulin resistance, and inflammatory responses by targeting JNK both in vivo and in vitro. On one hand, J27 blocked JNK activation, thereby improving insulin signaling and alleviating metabolic dysfunction in hepatocytes. On the other hand, J27 inhibited the inflammatory response in macrophages by disrupting the JNK/NF-κB axis, which, through cell-cell communication, further reduced hepatocyte injury. CONCLUSIONS: J27, as a potent JNK inhibitor, markedly reduced HFD-induced MASLD, suggesting it as a promising therapeutic candidate for this disease.",

      "abstract": "A preference for and overconsumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) are common among adolescents and are recognized as risk factors for multiple mental disorders. The protracted maturation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a key brain structure that plays a critical role in mental functions that are essential for both developing and mature individuals (including emotional processing, decision making, risk assessment, and creative thinking), during adolescence renders it more vulnerable to the environmental insults experienced during this critical developmental window. However, the effects of HFD consumption during adolescence on mPFC-related behaviours and the underlying mechanisms need to be further investigated. In this study, we observed that mice fed a HFD throughout adolescence developed depressive- and anxiety-like behaviours and distinctively increased risk-avoidance behaviour, accompanied by morphological aberrations of both pyramidal neuron and microglia in the mPFC. The systemic administration of minocycline, a well-known broad-spectrum antibiotic, effectively attenuated the adverse effects of HFD consumption during adolescence on neurobehaviours and the morphology of pyramidal neurons in the mPFC. This study provides new insights into the psychological effects of long-term HFD consumption during adolescence and indicates the existence of a window during which microglial stabilization may be a promising strategy to protect against the HFD consumption-induced increase in the risk of psychiatric disorders."

      "abstract": "There is active crosstalk between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment during metastatic progression, a process that is significantly affected by obesity, particularly in breast cancer. Here we analyze the impact of a high fat diet (HFD) on metastasis, focusing on the role of platelets in the formation of premetastatic niches (PMNs). We find that a HFD provokes pre-activation of platelets and endothelial cells, promoting the formation of PMNs in the lung. These niches are characterized by increased vascular leakiness, platelet activation and overexpression of fibronectin in both platelets and endothelial cells. A HFD promotes interactions between platelets, tumor cells and endothelial cells within PMNs, enhancing tumor cell homing and metastasis. Importantly, therapeutic interventions like anti-platelet antibody administration or a dietary switch reduce metastatic cell homing and outgrowth. Moreover, blocking fibronectin reduces the interaction of tumor cells with endothelial cells. Importantly, when coagulation parameters prior to neoadjuvant treatment are considered, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) female patients with reduced Partial Thromboplastin time (aPTT) had a significantly shorter time to relapse. These findings highlight how diet and platelet activation in pre-metastatic niches affect tumor cell homing and metastasis, suggesting potential therapeutic interventions and prognostic markers for TNBC patients.",

The MAFLD mouse model was established to examine the effects of RE through liver transcriptome and metabolomics analysis. In this study, RE supplementation significantly alleviated HFD-induced liver injury, hepatosteatosis, inflammation, and insulin resistance. Liver transcriptome analysis demonstrated that RE supplementation favorably regulated signaling pathways involved in fatty acid metabolism and inflammation, including the AMPK signaling pathway, PPAR signaling pathway, apoptosis, etc. Furthermore, the injection of compound C, an antagonist of AMPK, notably reversed the hepatoprotective effects of RE, evidenced by increased lipid profile levels, accelerated fatty acid-related gene disorder, and increased positive tunnel staining area. Furthermore, liver metabolomics analysis demonstrated that RE treatment led to substantial enrichment of the liver tissue metabolite umbelliferone (UMB), which has the potential to ameliorate lipid accumulation and hepatocyte injury through the AMPK signaling pathway. In summary, RE intervention mitigated HFD-induced liver dysfunction in mice, with UMB likely being the primary component responsible for its therapeutic efficacy in the liver. In addition, this study provided new insights, suggesting that RE could be used as a promising therapeutic approach for modulating MAFLD via apoptosis and the AMPK/PPARα signaling pathway.",

METHODS: Wistar (male) rats were arranged into several groups and provided with a control and HF diet along with the purple potato extract. Body weights, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), insulin, plasma lipids, and oxidative stress-related indicators were analyzed in plasma and tissue samples. Additionally, real-time PCR was performed to evaluate the gene expression for oxidative stress and fat metabolism in the liver. Histological staining was also performed on pancreatic and hepatic tissues. RESULTS: Purple potato extract lowered body weights and improved glucose utilization in the OGTT test in HF diet-fed rats. Purple potato extract also suppressed HF-diet-induced oxidative stress in plasma and hepatic tissues. Purple potato extract also restored the Nrf-2 expression in the liver, followed by the improved expression of HO-1, HO-2, and other antioxidant genes in HF diet-fed rats. In addition, genes involved in lipid metabolism were also positively modulated due to purple potato extract treatment. Furthermore, histological examination revealed the reduction of lipid accumulation and amelioration of inflammation due to the consumption of purple potato extract. CONCLUSION: This investigation revealed that antioxidant-rich purple potato extract can modulate the antioxidant and fat metabolizing genes expression, ameliorated oxidative stress and glucose intolerance as well as lowered blood lipids in male rats.",

However, few studies have focused on how the interaction between intestinal bacteriophages and bacterial LPS affects the development and progression of NAFLD. Herein, we determined that excessive fat intake significantly increases the levels of endogenous LPS, while the administration of beneficial metabolites of the intestinal microbiota (specifically butyrate) alleviated hepatic injury in rats. The beneficial mechanism of butyrate was attributed to the reprogramming of the structure of the intestinal DNA virome (primarily, phageome). Butyrate possesses the potential to augment bacteriophagic microbial diversity, thereby potentially facilitating interactions between intestinal bacteriophages and bacterial LPS (in the case of homologous phage), further improving mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species production, which, in turn, lowered HepG2 cell damage. Likewise, fecal phage transplantation further confirmed that intestinal phages from rats that received butyrate could effectively interact with bacterial LPS to reduce liver damage in rats. Taken together, modifying the intestinal phageome is a promising treatment option for high-fat diet-related NAFLD.",

      "abstract": "Yi Mai granule (YMG) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) herbal decoction consisting of two TCM formulas: Gua-Lou-Ban-Xia decoction and Si-Jun-Zi decoction. YMG has shown clinical benefit in the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which may be due to its regulatory effects on lipid metabolism. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of the gut microbiota and its metabolites in the use of TCM. However, the effect of YMG on the gut microbiota in the treatment of NAFLD remains unclear. In this study, we established an NAFLD model in ApoE-/- mice and treated them with YMG. High-performance liquid chromatography was adopted to identify the chemical components of YMG. By mapping the candidate targets using network pharmacology, we found that the targets of the main components of YMG were significantly enriched in NAFLD-related pathways. Moreover, 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that YMG affected the constitution and metabolism of the gut microbiota in NAFLD model mice, including lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Similarly, metabolites related to lipid and carbohydrate metabolism in mouse serum were significantly altered by YMG. The correlation heat map and network analyses showed that the gut microbiota and metabolites affected by YMG were closely related to the blood lipid content. Collectively, YMG may exert therapeutic effects by affecting the metabolism of gut microbiota, thus regulating lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. These findings offer novel insight into the pharmacological mechanism of YMG in the treatment of NAFLD and provide theoretical bases for its clinical applications."

Therefore, we urgently need a better way to treat gallstones. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of resveratrol (Res) on cholesterol gallstone formation and explore its underlying mechanisms, focusing on its modulation of hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) expression, bile cholesterol saturation, and hepatic cholesterol metabolism. METHODS: Thirty-two male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into four groups: control, model, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), and Res groups. Res (100 mg/kg/day) and UDCA (100 mg/kg/day) were administered via gavage for 5 weeks. Gallbladder bile, liver, and gallbladder tissues were collected for bile cholesterol crystal analysis, bile lipid profiling, and histopathological examination. Protein expression levels of PPARγ and scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) were analyzed using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Mice fed on a high fat diet resulted in larger gallbladder (about 2 times in both long and width diameters compared to control group) and CG formation, while resveratrol treatment significantly reduced gallstone formation, improved gallbladder dilatation, and declined cholestasis symptoms. Res suppressed hepatic inflammation by downregulating the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) expression and inhibiting the synthesis of proinflammatory factors. Res alleviated liver lipid deposition. It also enhanced PPARγ and SR-BI expression, promoting cholesterol efflux and lowering cholesterol levels, thereby preventing CG formation in mice. CONCLUSION: Resveratrol demonstrates significant potential as a therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of cholesterol gallstone disease (CGD) by modulating hepatic cholesterol metabolism, reducing bile cholesterol saturation, and alleviating hepatic inflammation. Further studies are warranted to explore its clinical applicability in humans."

A 2 by 2 factorial designed experiment of female ICR mice assigned to control (CON; 10% fat) or high-fat (HF; 60% fat) and either a 12-hour light-dark (LD) cycle or a chronic jet lag model of 6-hour phase-shifts (PS) in light-dark cycle every 3 days throughout pregnancy and lactation, resulted in 4 treatment groups: CON-LD, CON-PS, HF-LD and HF-PS. HF diet increased maternal pre-pregnancy body weight and elevated milk lactose. Whereas PS reduced milk lactose within the CON diet group, and increased maternal feed intake and fecal corticosterone levels. PS exposure also affected the time of day of birth. Neither PS nor HF affected birth litter size or pup survival. Only diet impacted final litter weight, with HF greater than CON. Among the 1204 lipids detected by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-profiling, diet altered 67.1% in milk, 58.1% in mammary gland, 27.2% in the liver, and 10.9% in plasma, with HF increasing the carbon length of diacylglycerols in the liver and milk, and carbon length of triacylglycerols in plasma, mammary gland and milk. Although exposure to PS had no overall impact on maternal lipid profiles, interactions (P < 0.05) were found between PS and diets in the phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolanine class of lipids. Findings support that high fat diet and exposure to circadian disrupting environments impact maternal feeding behavior and stress responses as well as lipid profiles, which may relate to their negative association with maternal health and offspring development.",

Although existing medications are effective, they often come with significant side effects, making dietary therapy an advantageous alternative. Hawthorn leaves and their active component, vitexin, have shown potential in regulating lipid metabolism and improving gut microbiota imbalance. This study utilized a high-fat diet-induced obese mouse model, administering different doses of hawthorn leaves and vitexin for 13 weeks, and employed 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomics to analyze the composition of gut microbiota and metabolites. The results demonstrated that hawthorn leaves and vitexin significantly slowed body weight gain, improved glucose tolerance, regulated blood lipid levels, and downregulated the expression of obesity-related gene in mice (ppar-α, ppar-γ, fas). Additionally, the treatment groups showed a significant improvement in gut microbiota diversity. Both vitexin and hawthorn leaves increased the abundance of Kineothrix, Paramuribaculum, Lawsonibacter (which belong to the Bacillota phylum) and Olsenella (Actinobacteria phylum), while reducing the abundance of Anaerotignum (Bacillota phylum). Moreover, the hawthorn leaves and vitexin treatments may alleviate obesity-related symptoms by increasing the fecal content of testosterone propionate, formoterol, and isoleucyl-prolyl-proline, and decreasing the content of Trolox. These findings highlight the potential of hawthorn leaves and vitexin as functional foods for obesity management by modulating gut microbiota pathways, offering a promising dietary therapy approach."

Male C57BL/6N mice were fed a normal chow (NC) diet, high-fat (HF) diet, or HF diet with L (HFL) for 15 weeks. Gene expression and histological examinations were performed on visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue samples. Biomarkers were quantified on sera. Murine macrophages were utilized for in vitro analyses. L decreased HF-induced endotoxemia and circulating inflammatory indicators. Despite having no effect on body weight, L reduced VAT inflammation by decreasing endotoxemia-induced NLRC4 inflammasome, inflammation severity, and fat cell hypertrophy. Although SAT response differed from VAT, inflammation was slightly reduced in this tissue too. In vitro, L modulated inflammation by directly reducing the pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotype. In obesity, increased NLRC4 inflammasome expression links endotoxemia and VAT inflammation. L protected against endotoxemia, maybe by affecting gut permeability and VAT responses. The decreased polarization of macrophages toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype and the reduction in adipocyte hypertrophy are involved in the response to L.",

The miRNAs sequencing and bioinformatics revealed that miR-22 was most abundantly expressed in the differentially expressed miRNAs after selenium treatment, and was enriched in lipid metabolism-related pathways. Moreover, Se significantly up-regulated the miR-22 levels and reduced the lipid content in liver or hepatocytes of grass carp. Furthermore, the miR-22m significantly increased levels of miR-22 and reduced lipid content in grass carp hepatocytes, which were consistent with the Se-treatment. However, the miR-22i reversed these trends. Besides, the miR-22 suppressed the FGFR1-PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway and its downstream genes related to lipid synthesis. More importantly, the Se-treated hepatocyte-exosomes which were enriched in the miR-22 significantly reduced the triglycerides content in the oleic acid-treated hepatocytes. In summary, Se alleviated high fat-induced lipid accumulation in grass carp liver by up-regulating the expression of miR-22 which negatively regulates FGFR1 and its downstream regulatory genes. Moreover, exosomes participate in the lipid reduction by Se, which may be through carrying miR-22."

Probiotic Lactiplantibacillus plantarum Lb41 (Lb41) has not been reported to have hepatoprotective effects. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the preventive effects of Lb41 against NAFLD in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice for preventing NAFLD. METHOD: To induce fatty liver, the mice were given HFD for 5 weeks, followed by silymarin (200 mg/kg) or Lb41 (108 or 109 colony forming units/day) with the HFD for 7 weeks. After 12 weeks, body weight, histological change, serum and hepatic lipid profiles, etc. was performed compared to control and silymarin. RESULTS: Lb41 had significantly reduced body weight (4.87 g) and serum lipids (triglycerides (77.64%), total cholesterol (67.53%), and low-density lipoprotein (40.50%) compared with the HFD group (P < 0.05). Lb41 significantly relieved HFD-associated hepatic injury by reducing aspartate transaminase (0.49-0.57 fold), alanine transaminase (0.49-0.51 fold), and alkaline phosphatase (0.76-0.90 fold) (P < 0.05). Additionally, they had decreased expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c and increased the expression levels of acyl-CoA oxidase, PPARα, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, acetyl CoA carboxylase 1, and fatty acid synthase in liver cells. Insulin and leptin levels decreased in the Lb41 treatment group compared with those in the HFD group. Meanwhile, adiponectin levels increased, similar to those in the normal diet group. CONCLUSION: Based on these findings, Lb41 probiotics have possible hepatoprotective effects and could be used as functional food materials.",

The pharmacological modulation of PPARα, CB1, or GLP-1 receptor activity has demonstrated beneficial effects, including anti-obesity actions. In this study, we evaluated a novel amide derivative of oleic acid and tyrosol (Oleyl hydroxytyrosol ether, OLHHA), a PPARα agonist, and CB1 antagonist, in combination with the GLP-1 agonist liraglutide (LIG), as an effective multitarget therapy to improve both the peripheral and central alterations in an animal model of diet-induced obesity. In rats, exposure to a high-fat high-fructose diet (HFHFD) induced weight gain and increased plasma triglycerides, LDL, and hepatic parameters. In the brain, the HFHFD provoked disruptions in the expression of proteins regulating food intake, the endocannabinoid system, the insulin pathway, and inflammation and resulted in altered tau expression and phosphorylation, thus indicating neurodegenerative changes. Based on our results, the administration of LIG or OLHHA alone was insufficient to completely reverse the alterations noticed at the peripheral and central levels. On the other hand, the combined treatment with both compounds (OLHHA+LIG) was the most effective in promoting body weight loss and ameliorating both the central and peripheral alterations induced by HFHFDs in rats. This multitarget therapeutic approach could represent a promising strategy for treating obesity and associated comorbidities.",

Intestinal immune responses have been associated with the regulation of metabolic dysfunction during obesity. Given that the epithelial cell-derived cytokine IL-25 has been demonstrated to regulate metabolic disorders, we sought to examine the role of intestinal IL-25 in modulating a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. We found that mice on a high-fat diet exhibited decreased IL-25 expression in the small intestine. Intestinal IL-25 mRNA levels displayed an inverse association with plasma triglycerides, total cholesterol, glucose levels, and the expression of the cholesterol transporter Npc1l1 in the intestine. In HFD-induced obesity, transgenic mice overexpressing IL-25 in the intestinal epithelial cells demonstrated diminished mRNA expression of intestinal genes related to glucose, cholesterol, and fat absorption, along with chylomicron production, while also systemically decreasing plasma glucose, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, fat accumulation, and weight gain. In vitro, IL-25 treatment of human intestinal Caco-2 cells directly decreased cholesterol uptake and downregulated the expression of NPC1L1 and its transcriptional regulator, SREBP2. These findings highlight IL-25 as a potential modulator in the intestine that regulates intestinal cholesterol absorption and systemic metabolism in obesity.",

      "abstract": "Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is closely associated with obesity. In AD, the fat cell-secreted protein leptin crosses the blood-brain barrier and protects against nerve damage. However, obesity may induce leptin resistance, reduce leptin sensitivity, stimulate excessive glial cell activation, promote inflammatory factor production and exacerbate brain inflammation. Unfortunately, the mechanism of interaction among high-fat diets, obesity, neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear. We investigated the changes in neuroinflammation and leptin sensitivity in the brains of wild-type and high-fat-diet-fed APP/PS1 transgenic mice. We explored the effects of treadmill exercise for 12 weeks on the leptin/LepR/GSK-3β signalling pathway and memory. The body weights of the high-fat-diet-fed mice increased, and elevated levels of markers for leptin resistance, including suppressor of signalling 3 (SOCS3), protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and proinflammatory factors such as tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), were observed. After 12 weeks of aerobic exercise, the leptin mRNA and protein levels increased, GSK-3β protein expression decreased and the mean fluorescence intensities of brain microglial (IBA-1) and neuron markers (NeuN) decreased, indicating that exercise may activate the leptin/LepR/GSK-3β signalling pathway, reducing glial cell activation and inflammation. Our study revealed that obesity induces and exacerbates the AD-related neuroinflammatory response. Aerobic exercise activates the leptin/LepR/GSK-3β pathway to relieve neuroinflammation and protect nerve cells, alleviating AD-associated memory loss. These promising outcomes could inform the development of nondrug-based aerobic exercise interventions for the treatment of AD and associated cognitive disorders."

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is pathologically associated with gut microbiota imbalance, which is implicated in disease progression through metabolic and inflammatory pathways. The therapeutic potential of inulin, a well-characterized prebiotic, has been explored to mitigate T2DM via microbiota modulation. However, the efficacy of this intervention, with its performance dependent on the degree of polymerization (DP), requires further investigation. This study assessed the therapeutic roles of inulin (DP3-60) and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS, DP3-10) in T2DM management. Dietary administration of these prebiotic compounds demonstrated a significant capacity to alleviate multiple metabolic pathologies, including obesity, insulin resistance, systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed induced T2DM mice. Significant superior efficacy was observed in FOS for ameliorating glucose metabolic dysregulation, adipocyte hypertrophy, liver weight, and histopathological alterations in colonic tissue, while inulin exhibited greater potency in alleviating oxidative stress. Both inulin and FOS enhanced gut microbiota diversity and richness in T2DM mice, accompanied by a significant reduction in Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. Notably, the S24-7 family emerged as a crucial microbial taxon modulated by both inulin and FOS. Furthermore, FOS demonstrated superior capacity to restore HFD-induced gut microbiota. Taxonomically significant amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), which were altered by HFD and modulated by inulin and FOS, exhibited distinct taxonomic profiles between the two compounds. This study provides preliminary evidence that the biological effects and beneficial properties of inulin-type fructans exhibit DP-dependent variations, which may enhance their efficient utilization in metabolic disorders."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity, characterized by excessive adipose tissue accumulation, has become a global health challenge with rapidly increasing prevalence. It contributes significantly to metabolic disorders including insulin resistance (IR). Renshen-zhuye decoction (RZD), a traditional Chinese medicine formula historically used for diabetes, shows potential for improving metabolic parameters, but its effects and mechanisms in obesity and insulin resistance remain unclear. PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic benefits of RZD on obesity and insulin resistance, and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms through which it improves glucose and lipid metabolism. METHODS: The role of RZD was evaluated in a high-fat diet (HFD) mouse model. The formula was characterized using UPLC-MS. Comprehensive analyses including histopathological staining, immunofluorescence, biochemical assays, 16S rRNA gene sequencing of gut microbiota, and non-targeted metabolomic analysis were performed. To validate the role of gut microbiota, we employed antibiotic treatment (ABX) to deplete intestinal flora and conducted fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments. RESULTS: RZD treatment dose-dependently alleviated HFD-induced dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, improving glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and energy expenditure. Gut microbiota analysis revealed that RZD significantly modulated the composition of intestinal flora and their metabolic profiles. Additionally, RZD reduced intestinal and systemic inflammation by enhancing intestinal barrier integrity, particularly through increased expression of tight junction proteins such as Occludin. Importantly, the beneficial effects of RZD on weight management and glucose homeostasis were antagonized by antibiotic intervention, while FMT experiments confirmed that these improvements were mediated through gut microbiota modulation. CONCLUSION: This study provides new insights into RZD's modulatory effects on gut microbiota and subsequent improvements in obesity-related metabolic parameters. RZD alleviates HFD-induced obesity and insulin resistance in mice by modulating gut microbiota composition and function, which subsequently improves intestinal barrier integrity, reduces inflammation, and enhances metabolic homeostasis.",

It can progress to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma without timely treatment. Current treatment options for MASH are limited. This study explores the therapeutic effects of fluorofenidone (AKF-PD), a novel small-molecule compound with antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties, on MASH in mouse model. Mice fed a choline-deficient, l-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD) were treated with AKF-PD, resulting in reduced serum ALT, AST, hepatic lipid accumulation, liver inflammation, and fibrosis. Network pharmacology and RNA-sequencing analyses suggested that AKF-PD influenced multiple metabolic, inflammatory, and fibrosis-related pathways. Further experiments verified that AKF-PD activated hepatic AMPK signaling, leading to the inhibition of the downstream SREBF1/SCD1 pathway and the activation of autophagy. Additionally, AKF-PD suppressed the expression of various inflammatory factors, reduced macrophage infiltration, and inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Moreover, AKF-PD attenuated liver fibrosis by inhibiting TGFβ1/SMAD signaling. In conclusion, this study reveals that AKF-PD effectively decreases hepatic lipid accumulation, liver inflammation and fibrosis in a CDAHFD-induced MASH model, positioning AKF-PD as a promising candidate for the treatment of MASH.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is a widely studied pathophysiological foundation of cardiovascular diseases. Inflammation and dyslipidemia are risk factors that promote the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. The gut microbiota and their metabolites are considered independent risk factors for atherosclerosis. Polydatin combined with hawthorn flavonoids, as the extracts of Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb. et Zucc. and Crataegus pinnatifida Bunge, have shown excellent cardiovascular protective effects. However, the underlying mechanism requires further investigation. Our study aimed to explore the anti-atherosclerotic mechanism through gut microbiota and their metabolites. METHODS: ApoE-/- mice were fed either a normal-chow diet or a high-fat diet. The polydatin combined with hawthorn flavonoids group received varied doses of polydatin and hawthorn flavonoids: a high dose (polydatin 200 mg/kg daily; hawthorn flavonoids 100 mg/kg daily), a medium dose (polydatin 100 mg/kg daily; hawthorn flavonoids 50 mg/kg daily), and a low dose (polydatin 50 mg/kg daily; hawthorn flavonoids 25 mg/kg daily). The control and model groups were administered distilled water (0.2 mL daily). The experiment lasted for 24 weeks. RESULTS: Polydatin combined with hawthorn flavonoids administration significantly reduced lipid and inflammatory cytokine levels, meanwhile, the atherosclerotic lesions in a high-fat diet-induced ApoE-/- mice were significantly decreased. Additionally, polydatin combined with hawthorn flavonoids also inhibited the enhancement of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), trimethylamine (TMA) levels of HFD-induced ApoE-/- mice by regulating the expression of hepatic flavin-containing enzyme monooxygenase 3 (FMO3). 16S rRNA sequencing results demonstrated that high-dose polydatin combined with hawthorn flavonoids treatment increased the abundance of Actinobacteriota, Atopobiaceae and Coriobacteriaea_UCG-002, and decreased the abundance of Desulfobacterota. Norank_f_Muribaculaceae was enriched in the medium-dose polydatin combined with hawthorn flavonoids and simvastatin groups, and Lactobacillus was mainly increased in the simvastatin and the low-dose polydatin combined with hawthorn flavonoids groups. According to the metagenetic results, functional annotations also suggested that the biological processes of each group mainly focused on metabolism-related processes. Specifically, polydatin combined with hawthorn flavonoids may regulate the abundance of TMA-producing bacteria (Coriobacteriaceae, Desulfovibrio, Muribaculum, and Clostridium) and related enzymes in glycolipid metabolic pathways to exert an important effect on the prevention of atherosclerosis. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that polydatin combined with hawthorn flavonoids could regulate the glucolipid metabolism-related pathway, attenuate inflammatory cytokine levels, and reduce atherosclerotic plaques by remodeling gut microbiota."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although short-term high-fat diet (S-HFD) and long-term high-fat diet (L-HFD) induce metabolic disorder, the underlying epigenetic mechanism is still unclear. RESULTS: Here, we found that both 4 days of S-HFD and 10 weeks of L-HFD increased mRNA m6A level in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) and impaired metabolic health. Interestingly, S-HFD activated transposable elements (TEs), especially endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) in eWAT, while L-HFD activated long interspersed elements (LINEs). Subsequently, we demonstrated that both S-HFD and L-HFD increased m6A level of Ehmt2 and decreased EHMT2 protein expression and H3K9me2 level, accounting for activation of ERVs and LINEs. Overexpression of EHMT2 in eWAT or inhibition of ERVs and LINEs by antiviral therapy improved metabolic health under HFD feeding. Notably, we found that both short-term and long-term HFD feeding increased Fimicutes/Bacteroidota ratio and decreased the gut microbiome health index. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments demonstrated that gut microbiota from S-HFD and L-HFD was responsible for increased m6A level in eWAT, resulting in glucose intolerance and insulin insensitivity. Furthermore, we identified that both S-HFD and L-HFD increased the abundance of the gut microbial metabolite homogentisic acid (HGA), and HGA level was positively correlated with unclassified_f__Lachnospiraceae which was both increased in S-HFD and L-HFD feeding mice. Administration of HGA increased the m6A level of Ehmt2 and decreased the EHMT2 protein expression and H3K9me2 level in eWAT, leading to metabolic disorder in mice. CONCLUSIONS: Together, this study reveals a novel mechanism that S-HFD and L-HFD induce metabolism disorder through gut microbiota-HGA-m6A-Ehmt2-ERV/LINE signaling. These findings may provide a novel insight for prevention and treatment of metabolism disorder upon short-term or long-term dietary fat intake. Video Abstract.",

We hypothesized that the ubiquitin ligases Murf and MAFbx would be increased in the obesogenic context, either by in utero obesogenic environment or by a postnatal high-fat diet, while the p70S6K-alpha kinase and its activation might be decreased. Eight groups of six male Wistar offspring formed eight experimental groups: control (C), control fed with HFD (CHFD), maternal obesity (MO), maternal obesity fed with HFD (MOHFD), and the groups with Epi intervention: C+Epi long, CHFD+Epi long, MO+Epi long and MOHFD+Epi long. By Western blot, we evaluated the Epi effect on the Murf, MAFbx, and p70S6K-alpha proteins in gastrocnemius and soleus tissues. The Murf level increased 2.59-fold in CHFD vs C group and 2.62-fold for MOHFD vs C group (p = 0.049 and p = 0.048, respectively) in gastrocnemius tissue. In soleus tissue, we observed an increase of MAFbx (1.52-fold) for the MOHFD group versus the C group (p = 0.049). Epi treatment did not modify any protein expression. In conclusion, we found an increase in the Murf1 protein levels in gastrocnemius tissue of the direct model of obesity; as well, we observed an increase of the Murf1 in gastrocnemius and of the MAFbx in soleus muscles in the group of rats obese by programming and fed postnatally with a high-fat diet (doble stimulus). In addition, since obesity could cause muscle atrophy, which results in impaired muscle function, it would be relevant in future research to evaluate these signaling pathways in animals of different ages in order to search for markers of the progression of diseases such as sarcopenia obesity."

However, cytotoxicity of TS limits its application. Reactive oxygen species produced by TS are responsible for the cytotoxicity, which can be mitigated by T. Herein, we evaluated the effect of a liposomal formulation co-encapsulating TS and T (TS/T-lipo) on obesity. We prepared TS/T-lipo and evaluated the resultant cytotoxicity and lipid accumulation inhibition effect in vitro. TS/T-lipo showed a significant inhibitory effect on lipid accumulation without cytotoxicity. The inhibitory effect on lipid accumulation is likely due to upregulation of Uncoupling Protein 1, which causes lipid consumption. Moreover, we evaluated the effect of TS/T-lipo on a high-fat diet-induced obese mouse model and found that body weight significantly decreased in the TS/T-lipo group without elevation of liver toxicity or blood glucose levels. Additionally, increased glycerol serum levels are suggestive of increased lipolysis upon treatment with TS/T-lipo. Histological analysis supports inhibition of lipid accumulation by treatment with TS/T-lipo. Taken together, this evidence demonstrates that co-administration of TS/T can reduce cytotoxicity and may be a promising candidate for an anti-obesity drug.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a progressive metabolic disorder characterised by obesity, insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, and hyperglycaemia. The long time-course of T2D in humans makes accurate modelling of sustained T2D in animal models difficult. The goal of this study was to develop and characterise an accurate and reproducible, non-transgenic model of sustained T2D in mice. Adult, male C57BL/6 mice were placed on a high-fat diet (HFD) for 17 weeks. From weeks 3-5, osmotic mini-pumps were implanted subcutaneously to slowly infuse streptozotocin (STZ; 200-350 mg/kg) for 14-days after which mini-pumps were removed. Body weight, blood glucose concentration, and glucose tolerance were monitored for 12 weeks post STZ treatment. Our data demonstrate that the combination of HFD and 200 mg/kg STZ delivered by mini-pump leads to increased blood glucose concentrations and impaired glucose tolerance, while maintaining obesity and hepatic dyslipidaemia. In week 17, plasma insulin concentration was assessed and showed that with STZ treatment, mice still produce insulin, but that this is reduced compared with mice on HFD only. Lastly, we examined pancreas sections using immunohistochemistry and show that there is no overt loss of beta cell mass. In conclusion, we demonstrate development of a reproducible in vivo model of T2D in mice that replicates a number of key pathophysiological changes seen in humans with T2D.",

Ergosterol (ERG) is a characteristic sterol of fungi with various bioactive functions; however, there are few studies on the ERG function of ameliorating obesity and following cognitive impairment. It was previously found that Zhashui Auricularia auricula (AA) is rich in ERG; therefore it was selected to enrich ERG through the intervention of exogenous inducers of rice bran oil (RBO), methyl jasmonate (Me JA) and salicylic acid (SA). The accumulated ERG was used to investigate alleviative effects on mouse obesity and cognitive impairment. According to LEfSe analysis of intestinal flora species, ERG reduced the abundance of obesity or inflammation-related intestinal microbial genera, while increasing the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria. The ERG sourced from AA significantly ameliorated HFD-induced mouse obesity by reducing lipid levels and liver oxidative stress, recovering memory and learning abilities of the mice by restoring the hippocampus function and downregulating inflammatory factors.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High-fat diet (HFD) induces negative effects on the activity of interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) and systemic energy metabolism. Irisin, a small hormonal agent known to modulate metabolism has been used for intervening HFD-induced obesity. However, its mechanism of action on iBAT function remains to be fully elucidated. This study sought to investigate whether irisin intervention could restore the thermogenic function of iBAT in mice with HFD-induced obesity, thereby regulating systemic metabolism. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) were used to monitor changes of thermogenic capacity of iBAT and systemic metabolism in mice with HFD-induced obesity and iBAT deficiency during 2-week or 4-week irisin intervention. Pathological and molecular biology analyses were performed on tissue and blood samples. RESULTS: Prolonged HFD feeding in mice induced obesity and impaired the thermogenic capacity of iBAT. MRI results showed that irisin intervention for 4-week reduced lipid content in iBAT, increased uncoupling protein 1 (UCP 1) expression and enhanced glucose analogue uptake capacity. These improvements of functions in iBAT activity were accompanied by an improvement in systemic metabolism. The positive effects of irisin appears to be dependent on the length of intervention time. When iBAT was removed, the beneficial effects of irisin were partially suppressed, suggesting that irisin regulates metabolism through the restoration of the thermogenic function of iBAT. CONCLUSIONS: HFD results in reduced thermogenic capacity of iBAT, while irisin intervention can effectively restore iBAT function, leading to improvement in overall glucose and lipid metabolism."

      "abstract": "The consumption of an unbalanced diet, such as a high-fat diet, is strongly associated with hyperlipidemia and significantly contributes to the development of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, which are the leading causes of death worldwide. Globally, about 17.9 million people die of cardiovascular disease each year (WHO 2023). Probiotics have emerged as a promising intervention to alleviate hyperlipidemia. Therefore, this study investigates the effects of Lactobacillus fermentum 166 (LF-166), isolated from yak yogurt in the Sichuan Tibetan area, on lipid metabolism in the liver and gut microbiota of high-fat-diet-induced hyperlipidemic mice. The results revealed that the Lactobacillus fermentum 166 (LF-166) treatment reduced the body weight and decreased the blood and liver lipid levels in these mice. Based on the histopathological findings, LF-166 could alleviate liver steatosis and colon injury. Additionally, 16S rRNA sequencing of the mice's colonic contents showed that LF-166 reduced the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) value and enhanced the richness and diversity of the gut microbiota. LF-166 regulated hepatic lipid metabolism through the up-regulation of the genes Lxr, Ampkα, Fxr, Hsl, and Atgl and the down-regulation of C/ebpα and Pparγ in the liver; it also regulated intestinal lipid metabolism by up-regulating Abcg5 and Abcg8 in the ileum and down-regulating the expression of the genes Npc1l1, Asbt, and Ibabp. Thus, LF-166 may inhibit hyperlipidemia progression by modulating the expression of key genes involved in hepatic lipid metabolism, influencing the intestinal microbiota through the liver-gut axis, and regulating systemic lipid metabolism."

In this study, we propose Rubia akane Nakai fruit extract (RFE) as a potential natural product-based anti-obesity agent. R. akane Nakai is a plant of the Rubiaceae family that grows throughout Republic of Korea. Its roots have long been used medicinally and are known for various bioactivities, but the fruit's bioactivities are unexplored. We investigated the anti-obesity effects of RFE using 3T3-L1 adipocytes and high-fat diet-induced obese mice. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, RFE inhibited adipogenic differentiation and lipogenesis by downregulating PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ), C/EBPα (CCAAT enhancer-binding protein α), and SREBP-1 (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1) through AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) activation and by delaying the initiation of MCE (mitotic clonal expansion), which is essential for early adipogenesis. At the in vivo level, RFE improved the phenotypes of obesity and insulin resistance. In white adipose tissue, RFE not only suppressed adipogenic differentiation and lipogenesis through AMPK activation but also improved insulin sensitivity by upregulating basal GLUT4 (glucose transporter type 4) expression. Therefore, this study advances RFE as a potential natural treatment for obesity and insulin resistance.",

This study aimed to investigate the effects of myricetin (MYR) on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- mice. Our findings demonstrated that MYR treatment significantly reduced the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, particularly at a high dose of 100 mg kg-1 day-1. Additionally, MYR markedly attenuated lipid metabolism disorders in ApoE-/- mice by decreasing body weight, improving serum lipid profiles, and reducing lipid deposition. Analysis of 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that MYR treatment enhanced the abundance of probiotic g_Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136, while it reduced that of obesity-associated genera, including Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group and Alistipes. Metabolomic analysis and RT-qPCR tests indicated that MYR upregulated hepatic bile acid biosynthesis, evidenced by increased total bile acid levels and enhanced expression of key enzymes CYP7A1 and CYP8B1, particularly through the classical biosynthetic pathway. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed strong associations between the regulated bile acids and these aforementioned bacteria. Therefore, our results demonstrated that MYR exerts an anti-atherosclerotic effect by modulating the gut-liver axis.",

Yet, mechanistically, how impairment in pancreatic islets alters cardiac function under different metabolic states remains largely unknown. Here, we investigate the role of the G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) in regulating islet adaptations to an obesogenic diet and its impact on myocardial function. Using a novel inducible β-cell-specific GRK2 knockout mouse model (βGRK2KO), we establish that loss of adult β-cell GRK2 delays metabolic islet maladaptation, protecting the heart against obesity-induced cardiac dysfunction. βGRK2KO are more insulin-sensitive than control mice and have improved cardiac function and myocardial morphology. Thus, genetic ablation of GRK2 in adult β-cells during an obesogenic diet play a cardioprotective role. This study prompts a novel therapeutic window for GRK2 intervention strategies for diabetic patients prone to cardiac dysfunction."

This study investigated the protective effects of Lepidium sativum seed extract (LSSE) on fertility and pregnancy outcomes in a rat model of PCOS induced by letrozole and a high-fat diet (HFD) (68% regular rat food pellets, 6% maize oil, 20% milk powder, and 6% ghee). PCOS was induced by oral administration of letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, (1 mg/kg in 2% DMSO) along with an HFD for four weeks and the results were compared to the metformin antidiabetic agent. Sixty rats were divided into five groups (n = 12): control, PCOS, PCOS + LSSE (250 mg/kg), PCOS + LSSE (500 mg/kg), and metformin (200 mg/kg). Half of the rats were euthanized after four weeks, while the remaining rats were housed with males (1 male: 2 females) for testing pregnancy outcomes. LSSE led to remarkable improvements in body weight, glucose, sex hormonal balance, liver and kidney functions, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory systems, mating and fertility indices, pregnancy outcomes, and fetal morphology. Histologically, LSSE treatment reduced ovarian cyst number and size, and enhanced the blood vessel, Graafian follicle, and endometrial morphologies. LSSE showed dose-dependent effects, with the high-dose demonstrating superior results in the biochemical parameters, while the low-dose showed the most promising pregnancy outcomes. LSSE exhibits potent protective effects against PCOS, surpassing metformin in several aspects. LSSE acts through multi-mechanistic action, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, metabolic, and hormone-balancing properties, along with its positive impact on fertility, suggesting that LSSE could be a promising natural alternative for PCOS management.",

Zingerone, a bioactive phytochemical found in ginger has potential for the treatment of metabolic diseases due to its antioxidant properties. This study investigated its potential reprogramming effect on some metabolic indices and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene in young adult offspring of Wistar rat models exposed to maternal HFD. METHODS: 30 pregnant Wistar rats were divided into five groups: Normal control group, an HFD control, and three experimental groups treated with 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg of zingerone, respectively. The treatment commenced from day 1 of pregnancy until postnatal day (PND) 21, after which the offsprings were weaned and placed on a standard diet until PND 42. On PND 42, the biochemical assays were performed on the offsprings using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits and the hypothalamic POMC gene expression using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance. Values of P < 0.05 were taken as statistically significant. RESULTS: Offsprings in the zingerone-treated groups showed significant (P < 0.05) decrease in body weight, glucose, insulin, cholesterol, triglycerides, and leptin levels compared to the HFD control group. Food intake and ghrelin levels increased, while POMC gene expression was inhibited with 100 and 200 mg/kg of zingerone. CONCLUSION: Maternal zingerone administration may mitigate the risk of metabolic disorders in the offspring, possibly by its influence on the anorexigenic genetic makeup of the offspring."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a global concern. The gut microbiota and hepatic fatty acid beta-oxidation have been shown to be important factors in the development of MAFLD. Independently, exercise and berberine can significantly ameliorate symptoms of MAFLD, although the specific mechanism is not clear; moreover, it is not known whether the combination of exercise and berberine produces a better therapeutic effect. METHODS: Over an experimental period of 17 weeks, the effects of exercise, berberine, and a combined (exercise/berberine) intervention on the composition of the gut microbiota and the expression of hepatic fatty acid beta-oxidation related proteins were examined. The mice were divided into five treatment groups: CON (control group, n = 10), HFD (high-fat diet, n = 10), HFE (high-fat diet + exercise, n = 10), HFB (high-fat diet + berberine, n = 10), and HBE (high-fat-diet + exercise + berberine, n = 10). The dose of BBR administered for oral gavage was 300 mg/kg, once per day, for 8 weeks. Mice were subjected to treadmill exercise, 5 days per week for 8 weeks, and the intensity was increased gradually. RESULTS: Serological and histopathological results showed that exercise, berberine and a combined (exercise/berberine) intervention effectively improved liver lipid accumulation caused by a high-fat diet. Analysis of 16S rRNA showed that the three interventions restored the species and number of gut microbiota in MAFLD mice. The functional prediction of gut microbiota revealed significant differences in beta-oxidation-related units among groups. Simultaneously, exercise and berberine intervention regulated the expression of hepatic fatty acid beta-oxidation-related proteins ACOX1, HMGCS2, and CPT-1α, with the combined intervention having a more significant effect than each intervention alone. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that exercise and berberine ameliorate MAFLD by regulating the gut microbiota and hepatic fatty acid beta-oxidation, suggesting that their combination may be a potential therapy for MALFD."

After 12 weeks of luteoloside (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg), obesity-related indicators were analyzed, such as serum, liver and adipose tissue indexes as well as gut microbiota and liver tissue-related protein expression levels. The results suggested that luteoloside intervention could reduce body fat mass and fat storage, improve lipid levels, glucose tolerance, and alleviate inflammatory disorders, especially in medium-dose treated mice.

The levels of ALT and AST decreased by 44.15 % and 33.00 %, respectively. The intervention of luteoloside improved the variegation of gut microbes, more specifically, it balanced homeostasis of gut microbiota in obese mice. Luteoloside could regulate the expression of PPARα protein and down-regulate the expression proteins related to lipid synthesis, thereby inhibiting lipid accumulation and regulating lipid metabolism. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the molecular mechanism of luteoloside regulating lipid metabolism imbalance in obese mice and to provide a rationale for it.",

Dragon fruit pomace, a by-product of the fruit processing industry, is rich in polysaccharides with potential health benefits. This study investigates the effects of dragon fruit pomace-derived polysaccharides (PDPS) in alleviating HFD-induced metabolic dysfunction. Treatment with PDPS in mice fed a high-fat diet led to significant decreases in body weight increase, abdominal fat accumulation, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations, along with a notable elevation in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations. PDPS also improved glucose tolerance and prevented fat accumulation in the liver and adipose tissue. Additionally, PDPS exhibited anti-inflammatory properties, evidenced by reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) in the liver. Gut microbiota analysis indicated a shift toward beneficial bacteria, such as Romboutsia, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Coriobacteriaceae_UCG-002, and Blautia. These findings suggest that PDPS may mitigate HFD-induced metabolic issues by enhancing lipid metabolism, glycemic control, and gut health, positioning it as a promising, sustainable functional ingredient for dietary interventions aimed at managing metabolic disorders.",

      "abstract": "Oat β-glucan has demonstrated an anti-obesity effect against high fat diet. However, its precise regulatory mechanism remains unclear. The anti-obesity effect was related to the structural characteristics. In this study, different molecular weight oat β-glucans were investigated, and yeast glucan was taken as the positive control. Compared with the low molecular weight oat β-glucan, the higher molecular weight β-glucan presented a superior anti-obesity effect, which might be attributed to its viscosity and fermentability. Oat β-glucan effectively modulated microbiota in both the large and small intestines. Correlation analysis revealed that ileal bacteria played a more critical role in lipid metabolism. Most bile acids are recycled in the distal ileum, and bile acid metabolism influences lipid metabolism. Consequently, the impact of oat β-glucan on bile acid metabolism was assessed. Oat β-glucan intervention reduced the abundance of Faecalibaculum, while increasing the abundance of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. These microbiota alterations contributed to an increase in 7-ketodeoxycholic acid, which was identified as a Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) antagonist in cell experiments. Inactivation of ileal FXR-fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) signaling by 7-ketodeoxycholic acid led to enhanced bile acid synthesis via the alternative pathway. Furthermore, upregulated cytochrome P450 family 27 subfamily A member 1 (CYP27A1) promoted chenodeoxycholic acid production, which subsequently activated hepatic FXR and further accelerated hepatic lipolysis through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα)-carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 A (CPT1A) pathway. These findings provide new evidence that oat β-glucan exerts anti-obesity effects by modulating bile acid metabolism."

      "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects approximately 1% of the global population. Its hallmark symptoms include severe pain and joint stiffness, which significantly diminish life quality. RA's development is influenced by multiple factors including unhealthy lifestyle habits. Calorie-rich diets, particularly those high in fat and resulting in obesity, are associated with RA and exacerbate its symptoms. Consequently, dietary modifications are recommended as a complementary treatment. However, adherence is often low due to the restrictive changes required in nutrient composition or caloric intake. Our previous findings indicate that time-restricted feeding (TRF) benefits leukocyte rhythm and mitigates autoimmune responses. In this study we explored the impact of TRF on the severity of K/BxN serum-transfer arthritis (STA) in mice subjected to high-fat diet. Three feeding schedules were implemented: a control (Ctrl) with constant access to standard chow, a high-fat diet group (HF) with ad libitum food access, and a high-fat TRF group (HF-TRF) with a 10-hour feeding window during the active phase. After four weeks of conditioning, STA was induced. Although macroscopic markers of inflammation did not differ between the Ctrl and HF groups, histological analysis revealed increased inflammation in HF mice, including expanded edema, pannus formation, bone erosion, elevated synovial neutrophil infiltration and serum leptin levels. Importantly, all these inflammatory markers were significantly reduced in the HF-TRF group, along with synovial IL-1β and monocyte/macrophage counts. Our results indicate that TRF can diminish the impact of a high-fat diet on STA severity, potentially serving as a preventive method and a sustainable therapeutic support for RA management.",

      "abstract": "Hydroxysteroid 17β-dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13) loss-of-function gene variants are associated with a decreased risk of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Our RNA-seq analysis of steatotic liver from obese mice ± fenretinide treatment identified major beneficial effects of fenretinide on expression of hepatic genes including Hsd17b13. We sought to determine the relationship between Hsd17b13 expression and MASLD and to validate it as a therapeutic target by liver-specific knockdown. Hsd17b13 expression, which is unique to hepatocytes and associated with the lipid droplet, was elevated in multiple models of MASLD and normalised with the prevention of obesity and steatotic liver. Direct, liver-specific, shRNA-mediated knockdown of Hsd17b13 (shHsd17b13) in high-fat diet (HFD)-obese mice, markedly improved hepatic steatosis with no effect on body weight, adiposity or glycaemia. shHsd17b13 decreased elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels, and markers of liver fibrosis, for example, expression of Timp2. shHsd17b13 knockdown in HFD-obese mice and Hsd17b13 overexpression in cells reciprocally regulated expression of lipid metabolism genes, for example, Cd36. Global lipidomic analysis of liver tissue revealed a major decrease in diacylglycerols (e.g. DAG 34:3) with shHsd17b13 expression and an increase in phosphatidylcholines containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) for example, phosphatidylcholine (PC) 34:3 and PC 42:10. Expression of key genes involved in phospholipid and PUFA metabolism, for example, Cept1, was also reciprocally regulated suggesting a potential mechanism of Hsd17b13 biological function and role in MASLD. In conclusion, Hsd17b13 knockdown in HFD-obese adult mice was able to alleviate MASLD via regulation of fatty acid and phospholipid metabolism, thereby confirming HSD17B13 as a genuine therapeutic target for MASLD and the development of liver fibrosis."

      "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a critical regulator of non-shivering thermogenesis and energy expenditure, offering significant potential for addressing obesity and associated metabolic disorders. Isoliquiritigenin (ISL), a natural flavonoid, has shown promising therapeutic effects in lipid metabolism-related diseases. This study aimed to explore the effects of ISL on lipid metabolism and obesity using a high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced obesity model in mice. Mice were subjected to an HFD and treated with ISL via gavage. The results demonstrated that ISL treatment significantly reduced HFD-induced weight gain and upregulated the expression of key thermogenic genes, suggesting enhanced BAT activity and thermogenesis. In vitro experiments using C3H10-T1/2 cells further supported these findings, as ISL treatment markedly increased the expression of UCP1 and PPARGC1a, which are critical regulators of thermogenesis. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ISL's effects, we conducted a transcriptomic analysis of BAT from ISL-treated mice. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes were predominantly associated with metabolic processes, including the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid degradation. These pathways are integral to energy metabolism and thermogenesis, providing mechanistic insights into ISL's anti-obesity effects. Additionally, ISL treatment significantly downregulated the expression of NNAT and SGK1, genes implicated in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. These findings suggest that ISL modulates BAT function by regulating the expression of these genes, thereby influencing lipid deposition and thermogenic capacity. In summary, this study suggests that ISL treatment has the potential to mitigate HFD-induced obesity by promoting BAT thermogenesis and modulating lipid metabolism. The molecular mechanisms involve the regulation of key metabolic pathways and genes, such as NNAT and SGK1, highlighting ISL's potential as a therapeutic agent for obesity and related metabolic disorders.",

We aimed to study the influence of time-restricted wheel running on whole-body energy and glucose homeostasis. Male, 8-week-old, C57BL/6NTac mice were fed either a 60% high-fat diet (HFD) or a 10% low-fat diet (LFD) for 4 weeks. Following this, mice were given access to a running wheel between zeitgeber time (ZT) 12-16 (early dark phase) or ZT 20-0 (late dark phase). Sedentary mice had access to a permanently locked wheel. Mice were housed under these conditions in metabolic chambers for 4 weeks in which LFD and HFD conditions were maintained. Following the exercise intervention, body composition and glucose tolerance were assessed. Wheel running during either the early or late dark phase resulted in metabolic improvements such as attenuation in body weight gain, enhanced glucose tolerance and reduced ectopic lipid deposition. However, late dark phase exercise resulted in a greater reduction in body weight gain, as well as enhanced metabolic flexibility and insulin sensitivity. Our data suggest that late dark phase versus early dark phase exercise confers greater metabolic adaptations in HFD-fed mice.",

      "abstract": "Metabolic and mood disorders elicited by chronic exposure of high-fat diet (HFD) are often associated with intestinal dysbiosis and persistent low-grade inflammation in the small intestine. This leads to remodeling of the epithelial barrier with disruption of the neuroepithelial circuits that control energy homeostasis by the gut-brain axis. Therefore, therapies that restoreintestinal microbial niche and barrier function are promising candidates to counter peripheral metabolic challenges that affect behaviors controlled by the brain. The endogenous oleoylethanolamine (OEA) was found to shape the intestinal microbiota profile towards a \"lean-like phenotype\", ameliorating pathological profiles of metabolic diseases. Further, OEA displays beneficial effects in several cognitive paradigms and preserves the epithelial barrier integrity, acting as an intestinal \"gate-keeper\". Here, we developed an \"intestinal OEA factory\" for the in-situ and controlled release of OEA by using a probiotic-based delivery system. We engineered the Lactobacillus paracasei F19 (LP) to express the human N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine-preferring phospholipase D (NAPEpld) gene and to produce OEA in response to dietary ultra-low oleate supply. We treated 12-week HFD male mice with oleate-probiotic formulations and assessed their impact on metabolic and behavioral dysfunctions, and microbiota-gut-brain signaling after 8 weeks of treatment. NAPE-expressing LP (pNAPE-LP) led to significant reduced weight loss and improved metabolic dysfunction in HFD-treated mice. Further, a parallel improvement in depressive- and anxiety-like phenotypes was associated with the duodenal barrier function retrieval, the restoration of the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, and an increase in beneficial bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, Prevotella, and Parabacteroides. The HFD-driven changes both in the enteric and central nervous system were prevented by pNAPE-LP/oleate treatment. Collectively, our data suggest that these effects were mediated by the oleate-dependent release of OEA by pNAPE-LP since no significant effects were observed in HFD mice treated with the native probiotic alone (pLP). This oleate-regulated delivery system of OEA is a safe and efficient probiotic-based strategy for the treatment of metabolic syndrome and related behavioral disorders."

      "abstract": "Despite extensive research on insulin resistance, which is associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity, there remains a lack of effective and safe methods to treat it. Thus, we hypothesized that cannabidiol (CBD), which influences lipid accumulation and inflammatory response, may interact with sphingolipid metabolism and insulin signaling. To investigate the effects of CBD, male Wistar rats were fed a standard rodent chow or high-fat diet for 7 weeks to induce IR and were treated with CBD or its vehicle administered intraperitoneally for the last two weeks of the experiment. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was used to assess sphingolipid concentration in the liver, while multiplex assay and western blotting were used to investigate the level or expression of proteins in the insulin signaling pathway and sphingolipid metabolism. Our results revealed that CBD prevented ceramide deposition in the liver of high-fat-fed rats through inhibition of the ceramide de novo synthesis pathway. Moreover, the accumulation of sphingosine-1-phosphate was notably increased with impaired catabolic pathway. Observed changes in the sphingolipid pathway coincided with improved insulin signaling after CBD treatment in animals fed a high-fat diet. Considering the presented evidence, CBD exerted a beneficial effect on insulin sensitivity in a state of lipid overload through the modification of sphingolipid deposition. Our study reveals the importance of broadening IR treatment methods, especially with natural substances that lack serious side effects such as CBD."

      "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) inhibition on cognitive function and metabolic parameters of senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). SAMP8 mice fed an HFD exhibited increased body weight, impaired glucose tolerance, and elevated serum leptin levels. In epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT), pharmacological treatment with FB23, a well-established FTO inhibitor, increased leptin production and modulated genes involved in lipid metabolism (Cpt1a, Atgl, Hsl, Fas), oxidative stress (OS) (Bip, Edem), and inflammation (Mcp1, Tnfα). Expression of hepatic genes related to lipid metabolism (Cpt1a, Atgl, Mgl, Dgat2, Srebp, Plin2) and OS (catalase, Edem) were modulated by FB23, although hepatic steatosis remained unchanged. Remarkably, FB23 treatment increased m6A RNA methylation in the brain, accompanied by changes in N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-regulatory enzymes and modulation of neuroinflammatory markers (Il6, Mcp1, iNOS). FTO inhibition reduced the activity of matrix metalloproteases (Mmp2, Mmp9) and altered IGF1 signaling (Igf1, Pten). Notably, enhanced leptin signaling was observed through increased expression of immediate early genes (Arc, Fos) and the transcription factor Stat3. Improved synaptic plasticity was evident, as shown by increased levels of neurotrophic factors (Bdnf, Ngf) and restored neurite length and spine density. Consistent with these findings, behavioral tests demonstrated that FB23 treatment effectively rescued cognitive impairments in SAMP8 HFD mice. The novel object recognition test (NORT) and object location test (OLT) revealed that treated mice exhibited enhanced short- and long-term memory and spatial memory compared to the HFD control group. Additionally, the open field test showed a reduction in anxiety-like behavior after treatment with FB23. In conclusion, pharmacological FTO inhibition ameliorated HFD-induced metabolic disturbances and cognitive decline in SAMP8 mice. These results suggest that targeting FTO may be a promising therapeutic approach to counteract obesity-induced cognitive impairment and age-related neurodegeneration.",

This study explored the effects of B. longum on mice with a 10-week high-fat diet and 6% gliadin (HFD + 6%G), assessing duodenal health, lipid metabolism, metabolomics, and gut microbiota in the duodenum and colon changes. Three B. longum strains were screened for gliadin hydrolysis to produce minimal R5 immunopeptide production. All three B. longum strains improved duodenal morphology, reduced intestinal permeability, reduced inflammation (IL-15), and activated tryptophan metabolism. Additionally, alterations in the microbiota of the duodenum and colon were also observed. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) showed that the HFD + 6% G group significantly increased the abundance of Ileibacterium, Alistipes, Bacteroides, Candidatus, Saccharimonas, Streptococcus, Sediminibacterium, and Odoribacterium in the duodenum. The abundance of Blautia, Butyricimonas, Ruminococcaceae UCG-010, Parabacterioids, and Eubacterium nodatum in the colon was also increased. The B. longum CCFM1216 and B. longum CCFM1218 reversed the abundance of these strains. Specifically, B. longum CCFM1216 enhanced the duodenal barrier with indoleacrylic acid, beneficial for blood lipids and glucose. These strains may be used as probiotics for gliadin-related diseases."

Glucose tolerance, tissue pathology, and serum biochemical levels were conducted to assess the effects of puerarin combined with Hericium Erinaceus insoluble dietary fiber (LH) on glucose and lipid metabolism. 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabonomics were employed to explore the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that the LH group significantly reduced body weight and hepatic and adipose lipid accumulation, and improved glucose tolerance and dyslipidemia compared to the Pue or HEIDF groups alone. Moreover, the LH group exhibited enhanced regulation of GM, including increased microbial diversity, higher abundance of beneficial bacteria such as g__Lactobacillus and g__Bacillus, and a decreased Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidota ratio. In addition, the LH group ameliorated HFD-induced serum metabolite changes and promoted the activation of tryptophan and glycerophospholipid metabolism pathways. The combination of Pue and HEIDF exhibits a synergistic anti-obesity effect by modulating specific GM (g__Lactobacillus and g__Bacillus) and serum metabolites.IMPORTANCEThe combination of HEIDF and Pue holds significant importance in the context of obesity. This synergistic effect not only aids in weight management but may also enhance metabolic health through various mechanisms, including increased satiety and promotion of fat oxidation. Therefore, incorporating these two components into the daily diet could offer effective strategies for the prevention and intervention of obesity and its related diseases.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: It is generally believed that refined grains lack nutritional value compared to whole grains. The objective of this study was to investigate whether refined highland barley (RHB) holds the potential to combat obesity-associated insulin resistance. METHODS: Thirty-two male 6-week-old C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into four groups fed with a normal chow diet, a high-fat diet (HFD), a 30% RHB supplemented HFD diet, and a 30% whole-grain highland barley (WGHB) supplemented HFD diet. We examined the anti-obesity and anti-insulin resistance effects of RHB and compared them with WGHB in mice. RESULTS: RHB intervention effectively improved obesity and insulin resistance, enhanced the intestinal mucosal barrier, and reduced inflammation. Moreover, it promoted the abundance of beneficial gut bacteria such as Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Lachnospiraceae_UCG-001, Alloprevotella, and increased the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in faeces. Additionally, RHB intervention modulated liver gene transcription, downregulating inflammatory genes like IRF3/7, STAT1/2, NLRP3, and TLR2. CONCLUSIONS: RHB could effectively alleviate obesity-related insulin resistance by targeting gut microbiota and liver transcriptomics, and its beneficial impacts are comparable to those of WGHB.",

However, its precise effects on endothelial function remain unclear. This study explored the impact of HBO on angiogenesis and apoptosis in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice with limb ischemia, focusing on the role of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). After 8 weeks on a chow or HFD, mice underwent unilateral femoral artery ligation and received HBO (3 ATA, 1 h/day for 5 days). HBO improved blood flow, enhanced vascular density, and reduced apoptosis in ischemic calf muscles of HFD-fed mice. In vitro, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were subjected to high-glucose and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions, with or without HBO. HBO restored cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation under these conditions, reduced mitochondrial dysfunction, and decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. However, these benefits were reversed by treatment with sirtinol, a SIRT1 inhibitor. HBO also increased SIRT1 expression and shifted mitochondrial dynamics toward fusion. Additionally, HBO upregulated angiogenesis-related proteins (VEGF, VEGFR, and SIRT1) while downregulating apoptosis-associated proteins (Bax, caspase-3, and p53). Collectively, these findings suggest that HBO enhances angiogenesis and reduces apoptosis in both in vivo and in vitro ischemia models, primarily through SIRT1 activation.",

Metformin is commonly prescribed for the treatment of T2DM, while exercise is frequently recommended as adjunctive therapy. However, the therapeutic efficacy and molecular etiology of combined therapy with exercise and metformin in DKD remain to be elucidated. The present study therefore aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects and mechanisms underlying the combined effects of exercise and metformin on DKD. A rat model of T2DM was constructed by administering a high-fat diet and intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin (30 mg/kg) for 6 weeks. The rats with T2DM exhibited reduced autophagic flux, increased oxidative stress, and morphological and structural lesions in the kidneys, compared to those of normal rats in the control group. The combination of exercise and metformin alleviated DKD, indicated by the elevation of renal autophagic flux, and a reduction in oxidative stress, renal fibrosis, and histopathological damage to the kidneys. Our findings suggested that exercise combined with metformin has a therapeutic role in DKD, and the study serves as a valuable reference for future research on the treatment of DKD.",

This study investigated the therapeutic effects of Aurantio-obtusin (AO), a bioactive compound from Cassiae Semen, on obesity-associated NAFLD. An obesity-related NAFLD model was established in ApoE-/- mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 24 weeks, with AO administered during the last 16 weeks. Mouse body weight, adipose tissue weights, liver weights, serum lipid levels, hepatic steatosis, inflammatory damage, and colonic tissue barrier integrity were evaluated. Gut microbial communities and serum metabolic profiles were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics. Hepatic lipid metabolism-related gene expression was assessed using molecular biology techniques. AO treatment significantly ameliorated HFD-induced adiposity, hyperlipidemia, and NAFLD symptoms. It preserved intestinal barrier integrity, modulated gut microbial composition by enriching beneficial taxa, and improved serum metabolic profiles. AO favorably adjusted hepatic lipid metabolism by upregulating PPARα and CPT1A while downregulating SREBP1, FASN, and SCD1. Correlation analysis revealed significant associations among gut microbial composition, serum metabolites, and disease indicators. AO's therapeutic benefits in NAFLD might be attributed to its ability to modulate gut microbial community composition and serum metabolic profile, enhance intestinal barrier function, and regulate hepatic lipid metabolism gene expression. AO presents a promising therapeutic agent for obesity-associated NAFLD, warranting further investigation into its potential clinical applications."

Low dose (DOP-L, 200 mg/kg BW), high dose (DOP-H, 400 mg/kg BW) and D. opposita powder (DO, 400 mg/kg BW) were oral-administrated to T2DM rats. After 6 weeks of treatment, supplementation of DOP-H and DO improved body weight and glucose/lipid metabolism-related indicators, including glucagon-like peptide 1, total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. DOP-H and DO suppressed liver oxidative stress through increasing the level of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione and reducing malondialdehyde. DOP attenuated the pathological change in liver, such as hepatic steatosis, and thus improved the liver function. Furthermore, the anti-diabetic effects of DOP was correlated with alterations of the gut microbiota, including an increase in Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and a decrease in Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, which promoted a healthier gut environment. Further analysis of short-chain fatty acids and metabolites provided evidences of DOP's regulatory effects on cecal contents in T2DM rats. Therefore, DOP-H present decent effects on T2DM, suggesting that DOP can ameliorate the insulin resistance and restore blood lipid level of T2DM rats with high-fat-diet by regulating intestinal microbiota.",

Due to its hepatoprotective, anti-obesity, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects, Protaetia brevitarsis (P. brevitarsis) larvae have been used as traditional medicine to treat liver diseases since ancient times. Therefore, this study was conducted to confirm the positive effect of fermented P. brevitarsis larvae (FPB) on NAFLD. The results showed that high-fat diet (HFD)-induced dysglycemia was improved by treatment with FPB as determined by testing for fasting blood glucose and oral glucose tolerance. The weight of liver and white adipose tissue and the levels of serum lipid, hepatotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity indicators were reduced by FPB. In addition, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction caused by HFD were improved by FPB. In a similar manner, HFD-induced hepatic steatosis was prevented by FPB through regulation of the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway and serum lipid profile. HFD-induced hepatitis and apoptosis were ameliorated by FPB via the nuclear factor-kappa B pathway and the B-cell lymphoma 2 protein family. In conclusion, this study suggests the potential for application of FPB as a prophylactic agent for treatment of NAFLD through suppression of lipid accumulation and inflammation in the liver.",

This study aims to investigate the anti-obesity effect of Hericium erinaceus protein (HEP) and its underlying mechanism. Our results demonstrated that HEP exhibited excellent radical scavenging activity in vitro. In vivo, HEP intervention reduced pancreatic lipase activity in the intestine and enhanced fat excretion, thereby inhibiting the absorption of dietary fats. Meanwhile, HEP ameliorated the body weight and organ indexes, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and liver oxidative stress injuries in obese mice. The results of real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analyses indicated that HEP upregulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), subsequently upregulated the expression of liver fatty acid oxidation-related genes (lipoprotein lipase (LPL), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT-1a), and acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1)) and downregulated the expression of lipogenesis-related genes (sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD-1), and fatty acid synthase (FASN)), thereby ameliorating lipid metabolism disorders. Therefore, these findings demonstrated that HEP exerted protective effects on lipid metabolism disorders by activating the PPARα pathway, indicating its potential as a dietary supplement for the prevention and amelioration of obesity."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic condition marked by hyperglycemia, which can affect metabolic, vascular, and hematological parameters. A low-carbohydrate, high-fat (LCHF) diet has been shown to improve glycemic control and blood pressure regulation. Exercise in hypoxia (EH) enhances insulin sensitivity, erythropoiesis, and angiogenesis. The combination of LCHF and EH may offer a promising strategy for managing T2DM and hypertension (HTN), although evidence remains limited. This study aimed to assess the effects of an eight-week normobaric EH intervention at 3000 m simulated altitude combined with an LCHF diet on hematological and lipid profiles, inflammation, and blood pressure in older patients with T2DM and HTN. METHODS: Forty-two diabetic patients with HTN were randomly assigned to three groups: (1) control group (control diet + exercise in normoxia), (2) EH group (control diet + EH), and (3) intervention group (EH+LCHF) Baseline and eight-week measurements included systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure (SBP, DBP, MAP), hematological and lipid profiles, and inflammation biomarkers. RESULTS: Blood pressure decreased after the intervention (p < 0.001), with no significant differences between groups (SBP: p = 0.151; DBP: p = 0.124; MAP: p = 0.18). No differences were observed in lipid profile or C-reactive protein levels (p > 0.05). Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) increased in the EH group (p = 0.027), while it decreased in the EH+LCHF group (p = 0.046). CONCLUSIONS: Adding hypoxia or restricting carbohydrates did not provide additional benefits on blood pressure in T2DM patients with HTN. Further elucidation of the mechanisms underlying hematological adaptations is imperative. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05094505.",

Methods:L. plantarum BXM2 was orally administered to male SPF C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) to evaluate its anti-obesity potential, as well as the effects on intestinal health and microbiota. Results: Our results demonstrated that L. plantarum BXM2 significantly decreased the perirenal adipose index and improved intestinal health by increasing the ratio of villus height to crypt depth and the goblet cell number in the intestine. Furthermore, L. plantarum BXM2 treatment exhibited regulatory effects on intestinal chronic inflammation in mice by normalizing the mRNA expression of TNF-α and IL-6. Of note, L. plantarum BXM2 reversed HFD-induced gut dysbiosis, as evidenced by the decreased ratio of Bacillota (Firmicutes) to Bacteroidota, the decreased abundance of obesity-related genera Dubosiella, Romboutsia, and Lachnospiraceae_UCG006, and the increased abundance of beneficial genera Akkermansia and Lactobacillus.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a condition characterized by glucose intolerance during pregnancy, estimated to affect approximately 20% of the whole pregnancies and is increasing in prevalence globally. However, there is still a big gap in knowledge about the association between gut microbiota associated metabolism alterations and GDM development. METHODS: All the participants accomplished the validated internet-based dietary questionnaire for Chinese and serum, fecal samples were collected. HFD, control diet or colesevelam intervention was fed to GDM mice models or Fxr-/- mice models, with or without antibiotics cocktail treatment. Fecal microbiota transplantation were used for further validation. Gut microbiota and metabolites were detected by metagenomic sequencing and high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. Bile acids of serum, fecal samples from human and mice were analysised. Body weight, average feed intake, blood glucose, insulin levels and oral glucose tolerance test was performed among each groups. Expression levels of Fxr, Shp and Fgf15 mRNA and protein were detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot, respectively. RESULTS: Our data indicated that high fat diet (HFD) was linked with higher prevalence of GDM, and HFD was positively associated with poor prognosis in GDM patients. Moreover, compared with normal diet (ND) group, GDM patients from HFD group performed a loss of gut microbiota diversity and enrichment of Alistipes onderdonkii, Lachnospiraceae bacterium 1_7_58FAA, and Clostridium aspaaragiforme while ruduction of Akkermansiaceae, Paraprevotell xylaniphila, and Prevotella copri. Additionally, HFD aggravated GDM in mice and gut microbiota depletion by antibiotics crippled the effect of excess fat intake. BAs profile altered in HFD GDM patients and mice models. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) further confirmed that gut microbiota contributed to bile acids (BAs) metabolic dysfunction during HFD-associated GDM development. Mechanically, HFD-FMT administration activated Fxr, Shp, and Fgf15 activity, disturbed the glucose metabolism and aggravated insulin resistance but not in HFD-FMT Fxr-/- mice and ND-FMT Fxr-/- mice. Furthermore, colesevelam intervention alleviated HFD-associated GDM development, improved BAs metabolism, suppressed Fxr, Shp, and Fgf15 activity only in WT mice but not in the Fxr-/- HFD + Colesevelam group and Fxr-/- HFD group. HFD induced GDM and contributed to poor prognosis in GDM parturients through inducing gut microbial dysbiosis and metabolic alteration, especially appeared in BAs profile. Moreover, Fxr pathway participated in regulating HFD-associated gut microbiota disordered BAs metabolites and aggravating GDM in mice. DISCUSSION: Modulating gut microbiota and BAs metabolites could be a potential therapeutic strategy in the prevention and treatment of HFD-associated GDM."

      "abstract": "The gut microbiome composition is intricately linked to the host's health status, yet the mechanisms underlying its interaction with the host are not fully understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), facilitating intercellular communication, are found in bodily fluids, including the intestinal content, where they may affect the microbiome. However, their role in type 2 diabetes (T2D)-associated microbiome and treatment implications are not explored. Our study investigated how host miRNAs may influence gut microbiome changes related to metformin treatment in a T2D mouse model. Analyzing fecal and gut mucosal samples via small RNA sequencing, we correlated results with microbiome sequencing data, identifying miRNA-microbiome correlations, bacterial targets, and proteins targeted in these bacteria. Significant differences in miRNA expression based on diet and intestinal location were noted, with minor effects from metformin treatment in the proximal small intestine of non-diabetic male mice. Key fecal miRNAs targeting bacteria included mmu-miR-5119, mmu-miR-5126, mmu-miR-6538, and mmu-miR-2137, primarily affecting Oscillospiraceae_NOV, Lachnospiraceae_NOV, and Bacteroides. Our analysis of targeted proteins revealed diverse biological and molecular effects. Further research into miRNA-bacteria interactions could lead to new strategies for manipulating the gut microbiome in T2D and beyond.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The high incidence of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) as a hepatic component of metabolic syndrome is attributed to the ongoing rise in obesity rates. Given the beneficial effects of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on metabolism, there is growing interest in combining it with fisetin (FSN), a natural product, to treat NAFLD more effectively. OBJECTIVE: The efficacy and safety of the combined therapy of FSN and HCQ in animal models of NAFLD were assessed, focusing on liver function, insulin sensitivity, oxidative stress, and inflammation. MATERIALS: and Methods: C57BL/6J mice were fed either a standard chow diet or a high- -fat diet to induce NAFLD. FSN and HCQ were administered to the mice, and biochemical parameters related to glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as oxidative stress markers, were measured in serum and liver tissue. Analyses included Oil Red O staining, mRNA levels of key lipid metabolism molecules, and immunohistochemical assessments of macrophage infiltration. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9. RESULTS: While the HCQ group exhibited some improvements in certain markers, it also displayed adverse effects. The FSN group, particularly the FSN + HCQ group, effectively reversed insulin sensitivity, glucose homeostasis, and NAFLD markers by modulating lipid metabolism and inflammation pathways. HCQ exacerbated oxidative stress, which was mitigated by the effects of FSN. CONCLUSION: Despite concerns regarding the long-term side effects of HCQ, its combination with FSN presents a promising approach for improving the management of NAFLD by reducing risks and enhancing outcomes."

      "abstract": "Chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) is a commonly used vegetable in Europe and is also regarded as a plant for both medicinal and edible uses in China. Chicory exhibits a substantial abundance of sesquiterpene lactone compounds within its composition. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) is increasing and has become a global public health issue threatening the well-being of the general population. Recent studies have identified plant secondary metabolites as potential substances for treating MetS. Sesquiterpene lactones, a type of secondary metabolite with diverse biological activities, have been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects, reduce lipid accumulation, and normalize blood glucose levels. However, the therapeutic effects of chicory sesquiterpene lactones on MetS remain to be explored, and little is known about sesquiterpene lactones' effects on intestinal flora and bile acids (BAs). Therefore, the effects of total sesquiterpene lactones (TSLs) from chicory on metabolic disorders, intestinal flora, and BAs were investigated in this study. In this study, C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks, followed by administration of TSLs, total chicory extract (TCE), and pioglitazone (Pio) for another 8 weeks. TSL, TCE, and Pio interventions reduced body weight gain, hepatic lipid accumulation, and lipogenesis in HFD-fed mice and attenuated plasma biochemical parameters. Among them, TSLs exhibited more significant effects, prompting further analysis of their impact on intestinal flora and bile acid metabolism. TSL intervention influenced the composition and structure of intestinal flora and BAs. TSL intervention impacted the composition and structure of the intestinal flora, characterized by a decrease in the abundances of Allobaculum, unidentified_Coriobacteriaceae, and Odoribacter, while the abundances of Prevotella, unidentified_Erysipelotrichaceae and Akkermansia were increased. Additionally, the levels of BAs TCDCA, GDCA, UDCA, 12-ketoLCA, 7-ketoLCA, and 6,7-diketoLCA were reduced. The research results indicated that TSLs from chicory may serve as potential agents for regulating metabolic abnormalities associated with MetS, as their effects can influence intestinal flora and BAs. The conclusions of this study are expected to open new research trajectories in the field of food science and nutrition, providing a solid scientific basis and innovative intervention approaches for the development of strategies targeting MetS prevention and management.",
