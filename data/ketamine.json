      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Rapid sequence induction (RSI) is a potentially-life saving intervention in critically ill patients. An important adverse effect of this procedure is post-induction hypotension (PIH), which is associated with worsened patient outcomes. Choice of induction agent can affect incidence of PIH, although the optimal drug has yet to be determined. Ketamine is postulated to reduce PIH incidence in emergency RSI when used instead of alternative agents. AIMS: This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effect on PIH incidence of inducing anaesthesia with ketamine during emergency RSI. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted to identify a sample of studies fulfilling criteria for population (emergency RSI), intervention (ketamine), comparator (any alternative induction agent) and outcome (PIH). No single definition of PIH was required for eligibility. A random-effects model was used to produce a pooled effect size estimate from the extracted data. The study question was also tested in pre-specified subgroups, including by specific comparator induction agent and by indication for RSI (medical vs trauma). RESULTS: 27 studies, including 6 randomised controlled trials, were eligible for inclusion, with total n = 31,956. There was considerable methodological heterogeneity. The pooled estimate of odds ratio (OR) of PIH when ketamine is used for emergency RSI is 1.10, with 95% confidence interval 0.78-1.56. Excluding data from the 6 studies (1 randomised and 5 observational) at greater risk of bias, the pooled OR is 0.99 (0.69-1.43). There was no significant difference between ketamine and comparators in any subgroup, although significance was approached when comparing ketamine to etomidate, with OR 1.38 (0.99-1.94) and p = 0.058. CONCLUSIONS: Choice of ketamine to carry out emergency RSI did not affect the incidence of PIH incidence in this diverse sample of studies. Given the breadth of inclusion criteria, applicability of this result is not necessarily universal. It is likely that optimal choice of induction agent varies according to specific circumstances in a manner as yet incompletely understood."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Approximately 30 % of patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) respond to ketamine; however, no replicable predictors of response have been reported. The imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmissions may be implicated in the mechanism of action of ketamine. This study aimed to evaluate whether the ratio of glutamate and glutamine (Glx) to GABA levels at baseline in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) could predict ketamine response in patients with TRD. METHOD: This exploratory study analyzed data from a double-blind randomized clinical trial with an open-label extension study (jRCTs031210124). Fifteen participants in the ketamine group and 15 of 16 participants in the placebo group received repeated intravenous ketamine during the double-blind and open-label extension periods, respectively. We measured Glx and GABA levels in the dACC before and after treatment during the double-blind period using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) was measured for depressive symptomatology. General linear models were used to examine the relationship between baseline Glx/GABA ratio and HDRS-17 score changes. RESULT: Changes in HDRS-17 scores (mean (±SD)) following ketamine treatment were -4.9 (6.5) and -4.9 (5.2) in the double-blind and open-label periods, respectively. A higher baseline dACC Glx/GABA ratio was correlated with greater improvement in HDRS-17 (β = -0.42, p = 0.040). In the ketamine group, a reduction in the dACC Glx/GABA ratio was correlated with greater HDRS-17 improvement (β = 0.74, p = 0.009) with no such association in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in the dACC may predict the efficacy of ketamine in TRD."

      "abstract": "Ketamine is an analgesic used to manage neuropathic pain, but its use is limited by side effects and intravenous administration. Recently, the use of oral and nasal administration has expanded. However, no systematic review of randomized studies on its efficacy and safety. A search was conducted in PubMed, CINHAL, and Web of Science up to December 19, 2023. Randomized studies evaluating oral ketamine for managing any type of pain were included. Articles were assessed for quality using the ROB2 tool, and results were reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The search yielded 1439 results. Six randomized studies were selected. The oral ketamine dose ranged from 0.5 to 10 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 400 mg/day. Three studies comparing oral ketamine with other analgesics found no differences between groups. Two studies compared oral ketamine to placebo; one showed a reduction in local anesthetic use and intraoperative pain, while the other found no difference. Adverse reactions were common, but their severity was not reported. Preliminary evidence suggests that oral ketamine may be considered in select patients with refractory chronic neuropathic pain. The potential use in outpatient settings warrants further high-quality studies."

      "abstract": "Chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) is a debilitating condition that affects up to 50% of patients after procedures like inguinal herniorrhaphy, significantly impairing quality of life. This case report describes a 63-year-old male who experienced refractory CPSP for 5 years following inguinal hernia repair. The patient reported persistent pain despite multiple pharmacological treatments, including amitriptyline, gabapentin, and codeine, as well as nerve blocks and nonpharmacological interventions like acupuncture. Periodic intravenous ketamine infusions (30 mg every 30 days) were introduced, resulting in substantial pain relief, improved mobility, and enhanced functionality. Ketamine, a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, has shown promise in modulating central sensitization in chronic pain, with minimal adverse effects at low doses. This case aligns with the 2018 consensus guidelines on ketamine use in chronic pain and contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting its efficacy in CPSP management. While this therapy demonstrated remarkable clinical benefits, further research is essential to establish optimal protocols and long-term outcomes for ketamine use in chronic postoperative pain."

However, many patients fail to respond, and limited data exist on predictors of non-response. This study aims to characterize the sociodemographic and clinical features associated with non-response to ketamine among TRD patients. METHODS: This is a post-hoc analysis of a naturalistic observational study, which enrolled 40 inpatients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder and analyzed sociodemographic and clinical features in responders and non-responders stratified per Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) during short-term ketamine administration (intravenous dosage: 0,5 mg/kg and orally: 2.0 or 2.5 mg/kg) that comprise over 4 weeks. RESULTS: In this study, 30 patients (75%) were classified as non-responders. No significant differences were detected among sociodemographic and clinical features beyond the history of substance use disorder (SUD) - only 53.3% of non-responders reported prior SUD (vs. 100%; p = 0.0075) and a lower number of psychiatric comorbidities (p = 0.0381). CONCLUSION: This study highlights key characteristics of TRD non-responders to ketamine, including lower rates of SUD and fewer psychiatric comorbidities. These findings suggest that a higher burden of traditional TRD risk factors may not limit ketamine efficacy and could even enhance response compared to \"pure\" major depressive disorder. Identifying potential non-responders early can optimize treatment decisions, reduce ineffective exposure, and guide future research on improving TRD management."

The objective of this systematic review is to provide insights into the safety and effectiveness of nebulized ketamine in pain management. METHOD: A systematic search was performed on online databases including WOS, Cochrane, Scopus, and PubMed, using a specific search strategy. Our review focused on primary studies about the utilization of nebulized ketamine in various contexts regarding pain management. Additionally, we incorporated relevant secondary research, such as reviews presenting diverse perspectives. RESULTS: Nebulized ketamine in pain management included nine studies. CONCLUSION: The advantages of nebulized ketamine over other forms of administration include its rapid absorption and effective delivery. The smaller volume required for nebulization can result in fewer side effects and enhanced patient compliance thereby facilitating efficient drug delivery while minimizing the systematic impact. Emerging evidence supports the administration of nebulized ketamine as a safe and efficacious treatment for acute pain. However, further investigations are needed for a better understanding of its pharmacokinetics, optimal dosing and efficacy across different populations.",

DESIGN: Mixed-methods, cross-sectional questionnaire. Electronic survey from November 2023 to April 2024. SETTING: Participants were recruited through snowball sampling, social media and referrals from UK addiction treatment services. The survey was open to international participants, with responses collected from the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Europe and Australia. PARTICIPANTS/CASES: A total of 274 individuals with self-identified KUD, including both treatment-seeking (40%) and non-treatment-seeking (60%) current or former ketamine users. Participants' ages ranged from 18 to 67 years old, with 47.7% identifying as male. Additionally, 58.8% reported a diagnosed mental health disorder. On average, participants consumed 2.0 g of ketamine per day, with treatment-seeking individuals reporting higher average use (M = 2.67 g) than non-treatment-seeking users (M = 1.68 g) (P < 0.001). MEASUREMENTS: Participants completed an online questionnaire addressing their attitudes toward ketamine and treatment services, including questions pertaining to their symptoms of problematic ketamine use, perceptions of education and awareness about KUD, opinions of existing treatment options, and facilitators for seeking treatment. FINDINGS: The study identified various physical symptoms associated with KUD, with bladder problems (60%), nasal problems (60%) and 'K-cramps' (56%) being commonly reported among all users. In response to these symptoms, the majority (56%) did not seek treatment; among treatment-seeking users only 36% reported feeling satisfied with their care. Symptoms of abstinence syndrome were also identified, including cravings (71%), low mood (62%), anxiety (59%) and irritability (45%). Treatment-seeking participants reported that the services they used had little (31%) or some (31%) awareness of ketamine, were not tailored to ketamine use (43%) and were generally only somewhat effective (43%). Fifty-nine percent of participants reported that there was \"definitely not\" sufficient awareness in education and peer groups about the risks associated with ketamine use. When asked about the most important factors when choosing a treatment program, cost/affordability was the most cited for all participants. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine use disorder (KUD) appears to be associated with a high prevalence of physical and psychological symptoms, including some specifically linked to abstinence. Despite this, most individuals with KUD do not seek treatment, and existing services are often perceived as ineffective."

Moreover, the overlap between problematic smartphone use and internet gaming disorder has not been well established in clinical contexts. This study explores the behavioral and psychological characteristics associated with problematic smartphone use, focusing on its relationship with online gaming behaviors among ketamine users referred for court-ordered addiction treatment. METHODS: The study involved 233 participants diagnosed with ketamine use disorder. Participants reported their daily smartphone use and primary usage purposes. Ketamine dependence was assessed using the Chinese version of the Severity of Dependence Scale. Emotional distress was evaluated using the Brief Symptom Rating Scale and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms were assessed using the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS-V1.1). Problematic smartphone use risk was evaluated using the Short Form of the Problematic smartphone use Inventory (SPAI-SF). Logistic regression was used to analyze factors related to problematic smartphone use risk. RESULTS: The problematic smartphone use risk group reported significantly longer daily smartphone usage (odds ratio [OR]: 1.64; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.29-2.08), higher ASRS-V1.1 scores (OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.05-1.23), and a greater likelihood of using smartphones for online gaming (OR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.19-4.29). CONCLUSIONS: Excessive smartphone use in ketamine users is closely linked to online gaming, and ADHD symptoms may increase the risk of problematic smartphone use in this population.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic stress is a risk factor for depression and may contribute to treatment resistance. This historical cohort study examined the association between baseline perceived stress, measured with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and response to (es) ketamine in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHOD: Adult TRD patients who received intravenous racemic ketamine or intranasal esketamine were included. Depression symptoms were evaluated using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report (QIDS-SR). Baseline stress was assessed using the PSS, with scores categorized into low to moderate (PSS < 27) and high (PSS ≥ 27) stress. Statistical tests, including Pearson correlation, Fisher's exact test, and Kruskal-Wallis tests, were used to explore associations between baseline stress, remission (QIDS-SR ≤ 5), and the number of treatments required for remission. Firth's logistic regression model estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Among 39 patients (median age 47, 61.5 % female), 66.7 % had high perceived stress. Patients with high PSS scores required more treatments for remission (median = 3 vs. 1, p = 0.04). Each 5-point PSS increase reduced remission odds by 60 % (OR = 0.40, 95 % CI: 0.14-0.81, p = 0.009), adjusting for stimulant use. Notably, these effects were independent of baseline depression severity. LIMITATIONS: The study's observational design and lack of a placebo group limit the findings. CONCLUSIONS: TRD patients with high baseline perceived stress had lower odds of remission, and required more treatments to achieve remission. Further research should investigate whether stress-reduction strategies combined with ketamine could enhance treatment outcomes and whether responses differ between acute and chronic perceived stress."

      "abstract": "Ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic with well documented abuse liability, can also provide rapid-onset and persistent antidepressant effects and is currently used for the management of treatment-resistant depression. Although the precise neurobiological mechanisms underlying its antidepressant actions are not fully determined, a critical feature of ketamine's clinical efficacy may be its antianhedonic action. Anhedonia is an endophenotype of depression defined by decreased responsivity to previously rewarding stimuli and is generally not ameliorated by conventional antidepressants, emphasizing the need to examine underlying behavioral mechanisms of action. In this study, the probabilistic reward task, a reverse-translated assay originally designed to objectively quantify anhedonic phenotypes in human subjects, was used in rats to examine ketamine's effects on reward responsiveness under conditions without programmed stressors (3.2-32.0 mg/kg) or during ongoing chronic exposure to ecologically relevant stress (10.0 mg/kg). Results showed that under conditions without programmed stress, ketamine produced significant prohedonic effects in the probabilistic reward task, defined by increases in reward responsiveness that dissipated within 24 hours. In rats exposed to ongoing chronic stress, ketamine produced significant antianhedonic effects, defined by the rescue of blunted reward responsiveness, that persisted for nearly 1 week. Taken together, the prolonged antianhedonic effects of ketamine in rats experiencing chronic stress, compared with the shorter-lived prohedonic effects in subjects without exposure to programmed stressors, are striking and highlight the role of environmental determinants in the effects of ketamine on behavioral processes. Moreover, the translational nature of this experimental design may offer the opportunity to accelerate development of novel antianhedonic therapeutics. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Although ketamine is used for the management of treatment-resistant depression, its precise behavioral mechanisms of action are not fully delineated. Emerging evidence suggests the attenuation of anhedonia plays a key role in its rapid-acting therapeutic efficacy. To evaluate this possibility, the effects of ketamine were studied using a reverse-translated assay of reward responsiveness in rats and documented to be short-lived (prohedonic) under nonstressful conditions and persistent (antianhedonic) under stressful conditions, informing ketamine effects in healthy versus depressed individuals."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ketamine and esketamine are increasingly used to manage treatment-resistant depression and have also been shown to reduce symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Little is known about how common comorbidities in the veteran population, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), may influence ketamine and esketamine treatment outcomes. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we analyzed clinical outcomes from Veterans Affairs (VA) San Diego Healthcare System's ketamine program to assess the relationship between ketamine or esketamine treatment and changes in depression and PTSD symptoms, while also examining how common medical comorbidities influence treatment outcomes. We specifically examined whether a patient's history of TBI or OSA would affect ketamine or esketamine treatment outcomes. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine how TBI and OSA history interacted with ketamine/esketamine treatment to change PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores. RESULTS: This study included 119 veterans who received eight sessions of ketamine or esketamine treatment at the San Diego VA Medical Center. Using linear effects modeling, we found that repeated ketamine or esketamine sessions were significantly correlated with reductions in both depression (p < 0.005) and PTSD (p < 0.05) symptom scores. However, in veterans with comorbid TBI (n = 38) and severe OSA (n = 9), depression symptoms did not improve over the course of ketamine or esketamine treatment, suggesting this subgroup may require alternative treatments or OSA treatment prior to starting ketamine or esketamine treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine and esketamine treatment did not improve symptoms of depression in veterans with comorbid TBI and severe OSA. Thus, our findings generally support ketamine and esketamine as effective interventions for depression and PTSD, while emphasizing the consideration of comorbidities such as OSA and TBI."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The rapid and clinically meaningful antidepressant effects of ketamine and esketamine are well-established in major depressive disorder (MDD) and treatment-resistant depression (TRD) as evidenced by improvement in clinician- and patient-reported depression measures. However, there remains a need to determine how these agents affect patient-reported quality of life (QoL). Herein, we aimed to systematically review extant studies evaluating the effect of ketamine and esketamine on QoL measures. METHODS: A literature search was conducted on online databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Medline, and clinicaltrials.gov) for articles from inception to September 30th, 2024, reporting on the association between ketamine/esketamine and measures of QoL in persons diagnosed with MDD or TRD. A risk of bias assessment was conducted using the ROBINS-1 tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: Five studies were identified that investigated the association between ketamine/esketamine and measures of QoL in persons with MDD or TRD. Scales used to measure QoL included the WHOQOL-BREF scale, Assessment of Quality of Life 8D test, and the EuroQol-5 Dimension-5 Layers. Statistically significant findings (p < 0.001) suggest that ketamine and esketamine improve measures of QoL in persons with MDD or TRD. However, an overall moderate risk of bias was observed in the papers included in this analysis. DISCUSSION: Extant studies suggest that ketamine and esketamine treatment are associated with improvement in QoL measures in adults with MDD or TRD. Limitations of this study include hetergeneity in the types of QoL scales as well as study study duration among the studies included. Near-term research priorities should endeavour to investigate the effect of ketamine and esketamine on specific domains of QoL, respectively."

This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of intranasal and intravenous ketamine in comparison to intravenous morphine in alleviating severe pain in patients presenting to emergency departments with various bone fractures. METHOD & MATERIAL: The clinical trial was conducted on patients over the age of 18 who presented at the emergency department of Imam Reza Educational and Medical Center with bone fractures. These patients were divided into three groups for treatment: intranasal ketamine at a dose of 1 mg/kg body weight, intravenous ketamine at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg body weight, and intravenous morphine at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg body weight. The severity of pain experienced by patients was documented using the numerical pain rating scale at the time of admission, and then at 15 min, 30 min, and 60 min after drug administration. RESULTS: The results of the study revealed that there was no statistically significant difference in the efficacy of pain relief among the three study groups (p=0.77). The interaction of (time*type of drug) had no significant effect on pain intensity (p=0.58). There was no statistically significant difference in side effects reported by patients between the three study groups, with the intranasal ketamine group reporting only minor side effects. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed significant effects of intranasal ketamine and intravenous ketamine in reducing pain in patients with bone fractures. The findings further suggest that the analgesic effect of intranasal ketamine is comparable to that of intravenous ketamine and morphine, with no significant adverse effects observed."

      "abstract": "Subanesthetic ketamine is currently used as a rapid-acting treatment for varied neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the mechanistic underpinnings of its therapeutic action remain unclear, and emerging clinical and preclinical evidence highlights a potential involvement of the opioid system. We used pharmacological functional ultrasound imaging data acquired during and after ketamine administration in male and female rats pretreated with naltrexone, an opioid receptor antagonist, or vehicle. We found that ketamine-induced functional connectivity changes are modulated by opioid receptor blockade, and that these responses are dependent on biological sex. Specifically, naltrexone sex-dependently altered the connectivity patterns within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a key node of the brain's default-mode network, and between the mPFC and other functional nodes. Furthermore, ketamine produced an opioid-dependent shift toward states of increased dysconnectivity and brain entropy in male rats only. Our findings warrant further investigation into the neurophysiological underpinnings of ketamine action and potential sex-specific interactions with opioid receptors."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Paramedics frequently administer analgesic medications for pain following trauma. Morphine is the most commonly administered strong analgesic. However, it may not be the best option as it may lower blood pressure, depress respiration and there is a risk of dependency. Ketamine might be a better option due to speed of onset and favourable side-effect profile. We sought to compare clinical effectiveness of paramedic administered ketamine and morphine in patients with severe pain following trauma. METHODS: PACKMaN was a double-blinded, randomised controlled, superiority trial, conducted in two regional ambulance services in the UK. Eligible patients were 16 years of age or over, had an acute injury, and articulated a pain score of 7 or greater on a 0-10 numeric rating score (NRS). We excluded pregnant patients, prisoners, those unable to articulate a pain score and anyone lacking capacity. The randomisation list prepared by the study programmer, utilised a permuted, unstratified, block randomisation system (variable size blocks) to achieve an overall ratio of 1:1 control (morphine): intervention (ketamine). Treatment packs were identical in appearance, apart from their unique sequential number. Individual participant randomisation occurred when the attending paramedic opened the treatment pack. The maximum available dose of morphine was 20 mg while the maximum available dose of ketamine was 30 mg. The treating paramedic administered the trial drug slowly, in regular small aliquots, via the intravenous (or intraosseous) route, titrating treatment until the patient reported adequate analgesia or requested that treatment stop due to undesired side effects. Timing of drug administration was not prespecified. The primary outcome was the Sum of Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) score on arrival to the hospital, calculated using patient reported NRS scores. Analysis was performed on an intention to treat basis. PACKMaN is registered with the International Clinical Trials Registry (ISRCTN14124474). FINDINGS: PACKMaN recruited its first patient on 10/11/2021 and achieved its recruitment target on 16/05/2023. We randomised 449 participants: 219 (49%) received ketamine and 230 (51%) received morphine. The SPID score was 3.5 (SD 2.8) for ketamine and 3.4 (SD 3.0) for morphine. We found no significant difference in efficacy between drugs (adjusted mean difference 0.1, 95%CI -0.4 to 0.6, p = 0.74). There was no significant difference in the incidence of serious adverse events [4 (2%) ketamine; 8 (3%) morphine]. There were no treatment related deaths. INTERPRETATION: Ketamine did not provide superior analgesia than morphine when used by paramedics to treat acute severe trauma pain. Unexpected adverse events occurred infrequently. Despite analgesia, many patients still experienced pain on arrival at hospital, highlighting the need for further research. FUNDING: PACKMaN was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research."

AIMS: This study sought to compare the efficacy of adjunctive ketamine and buprenorphine in mitigating anxiety symptom severity and craving intensity in individuals with co-occurring MDD and OUD. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind clinical trial was conducted, involving individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for both MDD and OUD. Participants were randomly assigned to receive adjunctive ketamine or buprenorphine, in conjunction with standard psychiatric and addiction treatments. Anxiety symptom severity and craving intensity were assessed using Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), and the Opioid Craving Scale after 2 h, 24 h, and 7 days. RESULTS: The findings revealed distinct treatment trajectories, with ketamine demonstrating rapid and substantial reduction in anxiety symptom severity within hours of administration, accompanied by a pronounced decline in opioid craving intensity. In contrast, buprenorphine was associated with a more gradual but sustained improvement in anxiety symptoms over several days, paralleled by a modest initial reduction in opioid craving, followed by persistent attenuation. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this randomized clinical trial provides evidence supporting the efficacy of adjunctive Ketamine and Buprenorphine in reducing anxiety symptoms and craving intensity in patients with co-occurring MDD and OUD.

      "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that prolonged or repeated exposure to general anesthesia is associated with white matter alteration in children, which may underlie subsequent cognitive and behavioral abnormalities. Numerous infants undergo anesthesia for surgery each year, so it is imperative to identify the risk factors and find preventative treatment to prevent the effects of early anesthesia exposure. Thyroid hormones play a pivotal role in the process of myelination of white matter. Clinical studies have shown that thyroid hormone levels are decreased after infant surgery, whether thyroid hormone supplementation can prevent long-term toxicity of anesthesia remains to be elucidated. Here we used S-ketamine, an anesthetic drug commonly used in pediatric anesthesia, to investigate changes in thyroid hormones after anesthesia and their effects on myelin development. Our findings showed a significant decrease in thyroid hormones following S-ketamine anesthesia. The administration of triiodothyronine (T3) supplements ameliorated the S-ketamine-induced impairments in motor coordination and myelination. S-ketamine-induced hypothyroidism predominantly affects the differentiation of OPCs to mature oligodendrocytes. Further analysis revealed significant alterations in lipid metabolism, and we observed that S-ketamine inhibited PPARα in OPCs. Treatment with T3 effectively rescued S-ketamine-induced suppression of PPARα. The protective effects of T3 were significantly compromised by the PPARα inhibitor GW6471. The pharmacological activator of PPARα, fenofibrate, rescued the motor coordination deficits and the inhibition of OPC maturation induced by S-ketamine. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that S-ketamine anesthesia induces the decline of thyroid hormone and hypomyelination in neonatal rats. Administration of T3 ameliorates S-ketamine-induced hypomyelination through the PPARα signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "The effective treatment of major depressive disorder remains one of the biggest public health challenges globally. For moderate to severe cases, pharmacotherapy often falls short, leading to treatment-resistant depression. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has generally been considered the gold standard for severe cases of treatment-resistant depression. However, emerging evidence suggests that ketamine may serve as a promising alternative. Two relatively large noninferiority trials and three meta-analyses support the efficacy of both treatments but report contradictory findings regarding superiority. The authors discuss possible reasons underlying these discrepant findings, including variations in patient selection criteria, study outcome measures, treatment delivery, and site experience. Additionally, the authors examine the unique risk and benefit profiles of each treatment, highlighting patient-specific considerations. By evaluating the most recent evidence for the efficacy of ketamine versus ECT alongside key patient-specific factors, the authors aimed to guide clinicians in recommending the optimal treatment choice for each patient."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ketamine has emerged as a novel treatment for psychiatric disorders, particularly treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Although intravenous (IV) ketamine is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for TRD, esketamine, an FDA-approved therapeutic, has contributed to the widespread clinical use of off-label IV ketamine across the United States. This scoping review highlights significant shifts in ketamine therapy, particularly after FDA approval of esketamine, the impact of COVID-19 on treatment accessibility, and increased regulatory scrutiny from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and FDA. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: What are the current practice patterns, patient demographics, and barriers to accessing ketamine for psychiatric disorders, particularly TRD? DATA SOURCES: This scoping review focused on provider utilization patterns (including frequency of ketamine administration, provider roles, and treatment settings), preferred administration methods (IV infusions, intramuscular injections, and other routes), and patient characteristics (age, sex, socioeconomic status, and primary psychiatric diagnoses treated). The Web of Science, PubMed, CBM, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, University Theses, and Embase databases were searched. RESULTS: Two survey-based studies were included. IV administration was the most common method of administration reported in both studies, with alternative methods such as intramuscular and sublingual routes emerging in limited use. Patients receiving ketamine therapy were predominantly middle aged (36-64 years old), with financial barriers identified as a notable obstacle because of limited insurance coverage. Access to ketamine was limited in rural areas, illustrating the need for expanded provider networks. Private clinics exhibited greater flexibility in treatment approaches than hospital settings, which adhered to standardized protocols. The absence of long-term outcome data and variability in treatment protocols emphasize the need for standardized practices and further research. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review highlights the widespread use of ketamine for TRD, but reveals significant variability in practice patterns and accessibility barriers. Findings emphasize the need for standardized protocols, expanded insurance coverage, and further research to optimize the role of ketamine in psychiatric care."

      "abstract": "Objective: This open-label clinical trial examined the preliminary efficacy of combining a course of 6 ketamine infusions with a brief, evidence-based exposure-based psychotherapy-written exposure therapy (WET)-in patients with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methods: The trial was conducted between June 2021 and October 2023. Patients with chronic PTSD and high-moderate to severe symptom levels received 6 intravenous ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg), 3 times a week for 2 consecutive weeks, plus 5 WET sessions over 2 weeks, beginning after the first 4 infusions and administered on different days than infusion days. The primary outcome was change in the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) scores from baseline (before the first infusion) to 12 weeks from start of WET (\"Week 12\"). Results: Fourteen eligible patients began treatment, and 13 completed all infusions and WET. The combined treatment was associated with large-magnitude improvement in PTSD symptom severity from baseline (mean CAPS 5 = 41.6 [SD = 6.2]) to Week 12 (CAPS 5 = 20.8 [14.8], Cohen d [95% CI] = 1.9 [1.0-2.8], P < .001). Nine (69%) patients were treatment responders (≥30% improvement on the CAPS-5). Response was rapid and also durable in 8 (61.5%) patients, assessed up to 6 months from baseline. Conclusions: Preliminary findings from this open-label clinical trial suggest that the combined treatment may yield large magnitude and durable reductions in PTSD symptoms for patients with more severe chronic PTSD. Large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the efficacy and potential synergistic effect of this promising combined treatment in this patient population.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune neurological disorder characterized by progressive muscle rigidity and painful spasms. Standard treatments often yield variable responses, particularly in severe, refractory cases. This case report highlights the novel use of ketamine as an effective therapeutic agent for managing acute SPS exacerbations, underscoring its potential as a second-line treatment for patients unresponsive to conventional therapies. CASE PRESENTATION: A 22-year-old male with SPS, diagnosed via anti-glycine receptor antibodies, presented with an acute exacerbation of symptoms, including severe stiffness triggered by sensory stimuli. Initial management with high-dose benzodiazepines, baclofen, and intravenous methocarbamol failed to provide adequate relief. The patient was subsequently treated with intravenous ketamine, resulting in rapid and significant symptom resolution. Despite initial improvement, the patient experienced multiple recurrent flares requiring repeated ketamine administration. Over time, ketamine proved consistently effective in resolving acute symptoms when standard treatments were insufficient. The patient's management was complicated by anxiety, hypoxia, venous thromboembolism, and other comorbidities, highlighting the need for a multidisciplinary approach. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates the potential utility of ketamine in managing acute and refractory SPS symptoms, providing rapid symptom resolution and reducing disease burden during severe flares. Ketamine's mechanism of action, including NMDA receptor antagonism and enhancement of GABAergic signaling, makes it a promising adjunct in SPS treatment protocols. This report emphasizes the importance of individualized, multidisciplinary care and the need for further research to establish ketamine's role in the long-term management of SPS.",

      "abstract": "Emerging viral pathogens, newly reported or rapidly evolving viruses, are a significant public health concern worldwide. Beyond their characteristic clinical presentations, emerging viruses, such as monkeypox virus (MPXV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have been increasingly implicated in the development of various neuropsychiatric complications including depression, mainly due to their ability to induce neuroinflammation, immune dysfunction, and neurotransmitter imbalances. Depression is a common mental health condition characterised by continuous low mood or sadness, pessimism, anxiety, and even a tendency to suicide as the main symptoms. Post viral depression commonly shows significant challenges, as traditional antidepressant agents exhibit suboptimal efficacy and prolonged onset of action. Regarding this, ketamine and its enantiomers, S-ketamine and R-ketamine, have recently received increasing attention as potential options in light of their potent and effective antidepressant properties. The present review describes the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of depression associated with emerging viruses, highlighting the role of neuroinflammation and disturbances inneurotransmitter systems. It also discusses the antidepressant mechanisms of ketamine and its enantiomers, the current clinical evidence demonstrating their effectiveness and safety, especially in the case of treatment-resistant depression, and their growing relevance for mood complications linked to emerging viral infections, including depression. Although preliminary reports propose effectiveness, additional studies are needed to present optimal treatment strategies, long-term safety, and incorporation into clinical practice. Addressing these challenges will be critical for optimising the effectiveness of ketamine- and (S, R)-ketamine-containing therapeutic protocols in treating depression linked to emerging viral infections.",

      "abstract": "Depression and PTSD are prevalent psychiatric conditions that often co-occur and significantly impact quality of life. Ketamine has emerged as a promising rapid-acting treatment for both conditions, while traditional treatments like psychotherapy typically require weeks to show effects. This study investigated whether combining ketamine with psychotherapy produces greater symptom improvement compared to ketamine alone. We analyzed overlapping samples of N = 202, N = 470, and N = 624 help-seeking individuals (all samples ∼60 % female, mean age ∼ 42 years) who received either ketamine alone (KET) or ketamine plus psychotherapy (KET+PSY) across 4-14 treatment sessions within a 30- or 180-day period. Depression symptoms were measured using the PHQ-9, and PTSD symptoms were assessed using the PCL-5. Trajectories of symptom change were analyzed using generalized additive mixed-effects models, controlling for baseline symptoms, demographics, and treatment intervals. Both treatment groups showed substantial improvement in depression and PTSD symptoms, with similar patterns of rapid initial decline followed by stabilization. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found no significant differences in symptom trajectories between the KET and KET+PSY groups. Exploratory analyses revealed non-significant but notable patterns where younger females showed better outcomes with combined treatment, while older males showed better outcomes with ketamine alone. These findings suggest that ketamine's therapeutic effects may be robust enough that additional psychotherapy during the acute treatment phase does not significantly enhance 30-day (and possibly 180-day) outcomes. However, longer-term benefits of combined treatment and potential demographic-specific treatment responses warrant further investigation. These results have important implications for treatment planning and resource allocation in clinical settings."

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Alcohol use and major depressive disorder are frequently comorbid, with individuals diagnosed with a substance use disorder being nearly three times as likely to have major depression. Poor treatment responses are found for both disorders and are further complicated when they co-occur, underscoring the need for better therapies. One potential candidate is ketamine, which has been shown to have rapid and long-lasting effects in individuals with treatment-resistant depression and, in some studies, reduces drinking in alcohol use disorder. However, though women are more likely to have this comorbidity, few studies have examined sex-specific effects of ketamine on alcohol drinking, nor have studies assessed the potential for ketamine to reduce reinstatement of alcohol seeking. OBJECTIVES: The primary goal of the present studies was to determine the effects of ketamine on alcohol-motivated behaviors in male and female rats, including in a model of stress + cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking using yohimbine (YOH). RESULTS: We found a selective reduction in alcohol self-administration and YOH + cue-induced reinstatement in females, but not males at a dose of 10 mg/kg ketamine. However, the same dose of ketamine was effective in reducing YOH + cue-induced reinstatement of saccharin seeking in both sexes. In addition, a different NMDAR antagonist, memantine, was effective in reducing alcohol seeking in both sexes, while the ketamine metabolite hydroxynorketamine (HNK) had no effects. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, these data suggest that antagonism of NMDARs may be effective in reducing stress-related alcohol seeking, but that ketamine has unique properties that lead to female-specific effects on alcohol seeking."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Benzodiazepines are the treatment for seizures in prehospital settings, but fail in up to 40% of cases, leading to benzodiazepine refractory status epilepticus (BRSE). Early treatment of BRSE is essential to prevent neurological damage and death. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist used by emergency medical services (EMS) for a variety of indications, has potential as a safe, effective prehospital treatment for BRSE. However, safety and efficacy data for early treatment of patients with seizures are limited. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients treated by EMS clinicians with ketamine for BRSE at a single urban ground-based EMS system between September 1, 2021, and December 1, 2023. Ketamine dose and route, patient characteristics, and airway interventions are described. Data were gathered from EMS records. RESULTS: Forty-two patients aged 8 months to 79 years, were included. Ketamine was administered intramuscularly in 22 with an average dose of 3.3 mg/kg, and intravenously or intraosseous in 20, with an average dose of 2.2 mg/kg. Ketamine stopped seizures in 38 patients (90.5%). Transient hypoxia occurred in 9 patients (22%). Respirations were supported with bag-valve-mask ventilation in 13 patients (31%), a supraglottic airway in three (7%), and one patient was endotracheally intubated (2.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine appears safe and effective for prehospital treatment of BRSE. Monitoring and intervention for respiratory complications appears necessary, but rates of these complications are consistent with expected rates from seizures and appropriate benzodiazepine dosing. These findings support ketamine's use in EMS for BRSE. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm safety and efficacy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ketamine is a rapid-acting treatment for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), though mechanisms related to ketamine's effects remain unclear. Blood-based neurotrophic and inflammatory factors (NIFs; e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor, interleukin-6) have emerged as markers potentially linked to ketamine and ketamine treatment response. METHODS: In this secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial (RCT), 133 adults with TRD received a single-dose infusion of ketamine (n = 89; 0.5 mg/kg) or saline (n = 44) and provided measures of peripheral blood NIF levels and depression severity across a five-day post-infusion period. Differences between ketamine and saline groups were examined for (1) NIF levels, (2) associations between NIF trajectories and depression score trajectories, and (3) associations between baseline NIF levels and depression score trajectories. Subgroup sensitivity analyses examined identical relationships within many (n = 28) discrete subgroups of individuals. RESULTS: No differences were found between ketamine and saline cohorts for NIF trajectories, associations of NIF and depression trajectories, or associations of baseline NIF levels and depression trajectories. On subgroup analyses, in participants with lower BMI (BMI < 25; n = 66), increasing interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) trajectories post-ketamine were associated with less improvement in depression in the first day post-infusion. DISCUSSION: Associations between ketamine treatment and peripheral neurotrophic/inflammatory factors were not detected in our RCT of 133 adults with TRD. The sole exception across exhaustive sensitivity analyses was that, in individuals with low BMI, increases in IL-1RA levels may be linked to worse immediate treatment response. Future research investigating CNS-specific NIF activity is needed to more definitively test the posited role of NIFs in ketamine's antidepressant mechanisms."

METHODS: This retrospective study included a total of 30 patients' medical records between 2020 and 2024 which were followed up for 6 months and 1 year after remission. Two groups of fifteen patients were formed: those who received concurrent treatment of both ECT and ketamine on consecutive days and those who received ECT alone. RESULTS: The mean age of the first group was 56.53 ± 4.83 years, and the mean age of the second group was 43.13 ± 5.13 years. The first group consisted of 80 % women and the second group of 40 % women. Mean age and number of previous depressive episodes were significantly higher in the first group (p = 0.034, F = 0.348; p = 0.019, U = 57.000). Treatment rates for both groups were 67.31 % and 67.22 % according to HDRS and no significant difference was found between the two groups. Nine (60 %) patients in the first group and 10 (66.6 %) patients in the second group did not require hospitalization during their follow-up. LIMITATIONS: The major limitations of our study are its retrospective design and the small number of patients. CONCLUSION: If ketamine or ECT treatments are used separately in TRD and no response is obtained, we recommend ECT + ketamine concurrent treatment as a protocol in TRD."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Approximately one third of children with generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) are not controlled by initial benzodiazepine therapy. We investigated the efficacy of adding ketamine to midazolam for first-line treatment of pediatric GCSE. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial included 144 children with GCSE aged between six months and 16 years, who were equally randomized to receive ketamine plus midazolam (Ket-Mid group) or placebo plus midazolam (Pla-Mid group). Primary outcome was cessation of clinical seizures at five-minute study timepoint. Secondary outcomes were the need for a second midazolam bolus; cessation of clinical seizures at 15-, 35-, and 55-minute timepoints; 24-hour seizure control; and adverse effects. RESULTS: Cessation of clinical seizures at five-minute occurred in 76% of children in the Ket-Mid group compared with 21% in the Pla-Mid group (risk ratio [RR] 3.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3-5.9; P < 0.001). Compared with the Pla-Mid group, the Ket-Mid group had higher percentages of seizure cessation at 15-minute (76.4% vs 23.6%; RR, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.1-5.0), 35-minute (83.3% vs 45.8%; RR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.4-2.4), and 55-minute (88.9% vs 72.2%; RR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.04-1.45) study timepoints as well as lower percentages of repeating midazolam (23.6% vs 79.2%; RR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.19-0.46) and endotracheal intubation (4.2% vs 20.8%; RR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.06-0.66). Both groups showed no significant differences in other outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine-midazolam combination may be more effective than midazolam alone for the initial treatment of pediatric GCSE, but this should be confirmed in future research."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The endogenous opioid system is thought to play a role in the placebo antidepressant response. A recent trial comparing the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine versus placebo in surgical patients, some of whom were on chronic opioid therapy, revealed a substantial placebo effect. This finding provided an opportunity to test the hypothesis that opioid agonist exposure interacts with placebo antidepressant responses. METHODS: This post hoc analysis utilized data from a previously reported randomized, anesthesia-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous ketamine in depressed patients undergoing routine surgery. Mixed-effects models were used to determine whether baseline opioid use influenced antidepressant responses to the trial interventions, as measured by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) over 1 to 14 days post-treatment. RESULTS: The analysis showed that baseline opioid use significantly reduced post-treatment depression severity in patients who received placebo, but not in those who received ketamine. This reduction was independent of baseline depression severity, baseline pain intensity, and ethnicity. Additionally, there was negligible correlation between postoperative pain intensity and depression severity. LIMITATIONS: This post hoc analysis was conducted on a small sample, and the findings need to be confirmed by prospective controlled studies. CONCLUSIONS: Opioid use at baseline attenuated the placebo antidepressant response independently of pain in depressed patients who received the study treatment under general anesthesia for routine surgery. The antidepressant response was preserved in opioid users who received intravenous ketamine."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) remains a challenge, necessitating novel interventions that address associated cognitive deficits. The glutamatergic modulator ketamine exerts rapid antidepressant effects, prompting investigators to assess its impact on cognitive function, specifically working memory. This study explored ketamine's influence on working memory and magnetoencephalography (MEG) patterns during a working memory task in individuals with TRD. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of ketamine on working memory, attention, and concentration, and to study MEG patterns during a working memory task in individuals with TRD. METHODS: Twenty-one individuals with TRD (14 with bipolar disorder, 7 with major depressive disorder) received ketamine and placebo infusions in a crossover trial. Behavioral and MEG data were collected at baseline and 6 to 9 h after ketamine and placebo (normal saline) infusion. Working memory, attention, and concentration were assessed with the N-back task. RESULTS: Ketamine significantly improved depressive symptoms but had no effect on cognitive performance. MEG revealed increased gamma power in the parieto-occipital junction coupled with decreased gamma power in the posterior superior temporal sulcus and inferior frontal gyrus after ketamine administration compared to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Despite robust antidepressant effects, ketamine did not affect working memory, attention, or concentration. However, distinct gamma power changes in brain regions linked to attention and working memory highlight the need to further explore the neurobiological mechanisms underlying ketamine's cognitive effects in TRD. Future research with larger samples, broader cognitive batteries, and repeated ketamine infusions are needed to fully elucidate ketamine's cognitive effects in individuals with TRD."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests the crucial role of dysfunctional default mode (DMN), salience and frontoparietal (FPN) networks, collectively termed the triple network model, in the pathophysiology of treatment-resistant depression (TRD). AIMS: Using the graph theory- and seed-based functional connectivity analyses, we attempted to elucidate the role of low-dose ketamine in the triple networks, namely the DMN, salience and FPN. METHOD: Resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fcMRI) data derived from two previous clinical trials of a single, low-dose ketamine infusion were analysed. In clinical trial 1 (Trial 1), patients with TRD were randomised to either a ketamine or normal saline group, while in clinical trial 2 (Trial 2) those patients with TRD and pronounced suicidal symptoms received a single infusion of either 0.05 mg/kg ketamine or 0.045 mg/kg midazolam. All participants underwent rs-fcMRI pre and post infusion at Day 3. Both graph theory- and seed-based functional connectivity analyses were performed independently. RESULTS: Trial 1 demonstrated significant group-by-time effects on the degree centrality and cluster coefficient in the right posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) cortex ventral 23a and b (DMN) and the cluster coefficient in the right supramarginal gyrus perisylvian language (salience). Trial 2 found a significant group-by-time effect on the characteristic path length in the left PCC 7Am (DMN). In addition, both ketamine and normal saline infusions exerted a time effect on the cluster coefficient in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex a9-46v (FPN) in Trial 1. CONCLUSIONS: These findings may support the utility of the triple-network model in elucidating ketamine's antidepressant effect. Alterations in DMN, salience and FPN function may underlie this effect."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 356 adult patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Patient enrollment occurred between April and October 2023, with in-person follow-up assessments conducted from admission to 3 days post-surgery. Participants were randomly assigned to the S-ketamine group (n = 178) and the placebo group (n = 178). In the S-ketamine group, participants received a continuous intraoperative infusion of S-ketamine at a dose of 0.30 mg/(kg·h) from the completion of spinal anesthesia until the beginning of joint cavity closure, whereas the placebo group received a continuous infusion of 0.9% saline at the same volume and duration. The primary outcome was the incidence of RP within 12 hours post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of RP within 24 hours, time to RP onset, time to first rescue analgesia, pain scores, opioid consumption, clinical outcomes, and harms. RESULTS: RP was observed in 21.3% of patients in the S-ketamine group compared with 34.8% in the placebo group within 12 hours post-surgery (adjusted RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.88; P = 0.008). The onset of RP was significantly delayed in the S-ketamine group compared with the placebo group (unadjusted HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.88; P = 0.009). The numerical rating scale during activity and physical therapy was lower in the S-ketamine group than in the placebo group (day 1 AM: unadjusted difference, -1; 95% CI, -1 to 0; P = 0.011; day 1 PM: unadjusted difference, -1; 95% CI, -1 to 0; P = 0.003; day 1 physical therapy: unadjusted difference, -2; 95% CI, -2 to -1; P < 0.001). The quality of recovery score was higher in the S-ketamine group than in the placebo group (unadjusted difference, 5; 95% CI, 5 to 5; P < 0.001). Patient satisfaction was higher in the S-ketamine group than in the placebo group (unadjusted difference, 1; 95% CI, 1 to 1; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: S-ketamine effectively reduces the risk of rebound pain and delays its onset in total knee arthroplasty. Additionally, S-ketamine can reduce early pain levels, enhance recovery quality, and improve patient satisfaction.",

As a result, researchers are exploring alternative treatments that include ketamine as a prophylactic against these disorders. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge on the use of ketamine as a prophylactic for stress-induced disorders, including preclinical and clinical findings on R,S-ketamine, as well as (2R,6R)- and (2S,6S)-hydroxynorketamine. We also explore the potential underlying mechanisms involved in preventing these disorders, including the brain regions/circuits, as well as glutamatergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, and inflammatory processes known to be involved, as evidenced by studies with ketamine and its metabolites. Additionally, we highlight the limitations and risks associated with ketamine use, such as age- and sex-specific efficacy, potential long-term and adverse effects, and legal and ethical considerations. Finally, we discuss future research directions, including the implications for clinical practice, integrating ketamine into current treatment approaches, and potential advancements in ketamine-based therapies. Overall, the literature emphasizes the importance of continuing research to better understand the potential benefits and risks of ketamine as a prophylactic for stress-induced disorders."

      "abstract": "Hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and oxidative stress represent important mechanisms that have been implicated in etiopathology of depression. Although first antidepressants were introduced in clinical practice more than six decades ago, approximately 30 % of patients with a diagnosis of depression show treatment resistance. A noncompetitive N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine has shown promising rapid antidepressant effects and has been approved for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). In the present study, we investigated antioxidant and antidepressant-like activity of a single subanesthetic dose of ketamine (10 mg/kg, ip) in a rodent model of TRD induced by adrenocorticotropic hormone (10 μg ACTH/day, sc, 21 days). Behavioral assessment was performed, and plasma biomarkers of oxidative stress and DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were determined. We observed that ACTH produced depressive-like behavior and significant increase in superoxide anion (O2·-), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), malondialdehyde (MDA) and total oxidant status (TOS) in male Wistar rats. This effect was accompanied by reduced activity of antioxidant enzymes - superoxide dismutase (SOD) and paraoxonase1 (PON1) in plasma and increase in DNA damage in PBLs. In the described model of TRD, we have demonstrated antidepressant effects of ketamine for the first time. Our results reveal that ketamine was effective in reducing O2.-, AOPP, MDA and TOS, while enhancing SOD and PON1 activity in ACTH-rats. Collectively, our study sheds light on molecular mechanisms implicated in antioxidant activity of ketamine, thus incentivizing further investigation of its effects on ROS metabolism and antioxidant defenses in clinical trials, particularly in depression."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Opiate-based pain regimens remain the cornerstone of pain management following traumatic injury, but issues related to opioids have driven research into alternative analgesics. Adjunctive ketamine has been increasingly used to decrease opioid use, but little evidence exists to support its efficacy within the trauma population. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of severely injured (Injury Severity Score [ISS], ≥15) adult patients (aged 18-64 years) admitted to a Level 1 trauma center was conducted. Exclusion criteria included Glasgow Coma Scale score of <14, ISS of <15, pregnancy, and chronic opiate use. All patients were prescribed a patient-controlled analgesia in addition to being randomized to either adjustable dose ketamine starting at 3 μg/kg/min or an equivalent rate of 0.9% normal saline. Study drug and patient-controlled analgesia titration were allowed as part of a treatment algorithm. The primary outcome was reduction in oral morphine equivalent (OME) utilization at 24 hours. RESULTS: We performed a planned interim analysis upon reaching a predetermined enrollment goal. Forty-two of 78 patients (53.8%) were randomized to the experimental arm. Both groups were similar in makeup and had a median ISS of 22 (19, 28.5). The median OMEs in adjustable dose ketamine and placebo groups were 110.6 (55.7, 191.7) and 99.2 (50.6, 172.6), respectively (p = 0.85). No significant difference in OME was found in 24- to 48-hour or the entire 48-hour study period. Adjustable dose ketamine had no impact on pain scores throughout the study period when compared with placebo (4.9 vs. 4.7, p = 0.95). These findings met the futility cutoff, and enrollment was terminated. CONCLUSION: Adjustable dose ketamine failed to reduce OME totals or pain scores in a severely injured trauma cohort when compared with placebo at any time point. Additional studies are necessary to determine if there is any benefit for adjuvant ketamine in different trauma subpopulations. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic; Level I."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia (SCZ) has limited treatment options, often with significant side effects. Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-euphoric phytocannabinoid, has shown potential as a novel therapeutic option in SCZ due to antipsychotic-like, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. We compared the therapeutic effects of CBD and risperidone (RISP) in a rat model of SCZ induced by sub-chronic ketamine (KET), focusing on inflammatory and oxidative stress, and behavioral phenotypes. METHODS: Rats were pre-treated with KET or saline (SAL) for 10 days followed by CBD or RISP for 8 days. Locomotion, anxiety- and anhedonia-like behavior, and recognition memory were assessed. Oxidative damage as measured by protein carbonyls, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, and catalase activity, and the inflammation markers myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and nitrite/nitrate (N/N) concentration ratio were assessed in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hypothalamus (HYP), hippocampus (HPC), and striatum, brain areas relevant to SCZ. RESULTS: CBD restored the KET-induced decreased rearing behavior in the OFT, while RISP further decreased rearing. RISP treatment in control rats decreased rearing and elicited an anhedonic-like phenotype, while CBD did not. CBD, but not RISP restored the KET-induced increased levels of MPO activity in the PFC and the striatum, and protein carbonyls in the HPC. Post-KET treatment with RISP but not CBD decreased protein carbonyls in the PFC, and decreased the N/N concentration ratio in the HYP. CONCLUSION: CBD restored the KET-induced decrease in rearing behavior without inducing an anhedonic-like phenotype as observed with RISP. CBD, and to a lesser extent RISP restored the oxidative stress and neuroinflammation elicited by KET in the striatum, HPC, and PFC. These findings support the possibility that the antipsychotic effects of CBD might be mediated by its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.",

Ketamine, a non-opioid analgesic, holds potential for managing acute SCD due to its opioid-sparing properties. This study aimed to explore the barriers and facilitators to an inpatient clinical trial of ketamine infusion for treatment of acute SCD pain. METHODS: A mixed-methods design integrated quantitative survey data from 70 sickle cell and emergency medicine clinicians with qualitative insights from 10 patient focus group participants. Survey responses (n = 77 total, including seven registered nurses) were analyzed descriptively and via Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U-tests, while focus groups were thematically coded using themes from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. RESULTS: Clinicians showed varied comfort levels with ketamine, with significant differences between sickle cell and emergency medicine clinicians. Barriers to future trials included the lack of standardized protocols (50.6%) and providers' attitudes regarding ketamine (32.5%). Patients cited trust in providers and potential health benefits as key facilitators but also expressed concerns about safety, confidentiality, and time commitment of trial participation. CONCLUSION: Successful implementation of inpatient trials of pain interventions, such as ketamine infusions, requires a multidisciplinary approach, transparent communication about risks, strong clinical frameworks, and patient-centered trial designs. While study limitations, such as potential selection bias and low survey response rate, should be considered, these findings provide actionable insights to guide the design of future clinical trials and improve non-opioid pain management for SCD."

      "abstract": "Acute traumatic neural injury, also known as traumatic brain injury (TBI), is a leading cause of death. TBI treatment focuses on the use of sedatives, vasopressors, and invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring to mitigate ICP elevations and maintain cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). While common sedatives such as propofol and fentanyl have significant side effects, ketamine is an attractive alternative due to its rapid onset and cardiovascular stability. Despite these benefits, ketamine's use remains controversial due to historical concerns about increasing ICP. Using high-frequency monitoring, this retrospective study compared cerebral pressure-flow dynamics in patients with moderate/severe TBI who received ketamine with those who did not. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, comparisons within and between patients receiving ketamine, and evaluation of physiological response around incremental dose changes in ketamine. Various cerebral physiological indices were analyzed, including ICP, CPP, regional cerebral oxygen delivery, intracranial compliance, and cardiovascular reactivity metrics. A total of 122 patients were studied, with 17 receiving ketamine (median age: 37 years) and 105 not receiving ketamine (median age: 42 years). Results indicated higher median ICP in the ketamine group compared with the no ketamine group (9.05 mmHg and 14.00 mmHg, respectively, p = 0.00017); however, this is likely due to differences in patient characteristics and injury severity between the groups. No significant differences were observed in any other index of cerebral pressure-flow dynamics or between any incremental dose change condition. These findings suggest that ketamine does not significantly impact cerebral pressure-flow dynamics, challenging historical concerns about its use in patients with TBI."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Low-dose ketamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist that exerts an antidepressant effect on patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). This antidepressant effect may extend beyond the glutamatergic hypothesis. Nevertheless, the roles of genes encoding other monoamine neurotransmitters (i.e., serotonin and dopamine) in the neuromechanism of low-dose ketamine remain unknown. METHODS: In this clinical trial, which involved 65 patients with TRD, 21 patients received 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 20 received 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and 24 received normal saline. All patients were genotyped for 684,616 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A total of 50 monoamine neurotransmitter-related candidate genes, including HTR2A and HTR2C from the serotoninergic system, CHRM4 and CHRNB1 from the cholinergic system, and DRD2 from the dopaminergic system, were selected to conduct a gene-based genome-wide association study of the antidepressant effects of ketamine. RESULTS: Gene-set enrichment analysis revealed that the pathway underlying neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction (KEGG) played a pivotal role in the biomechanisms underlying ketamine's antidepressant effect. Specifically, the genes and SNPs related to the cholinergic system (e.g., rs2644247 in CHRM5), μ1 opioid receptor (e.g., rs2473546 in OPRM1), dopaminergic system (e.g., rs2617577 in SLC6A3), serotonergic system (HTR2A), cannabinoid receptor (CNR2), and σ1 receptor (SIGMAR1) were associated with the antidepressant effect of low-dose ketamine. DISCUSSION: Low-dose ketamine has an antidepressant effect, which may be associated with multiple monoamine neurotransmitter systems and the σ1 receptor."

      "abstract": "Assessment measures for suicidal behavior range from depression scales to longer suicide-specific instruments. In this review, we systematically summarize and discuss the currently used instruments for assessing suicidal behavior in the context of ketamine and its enantiomers. We searched Medline/PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO databases for ketamine (and its enantiomers) human studies exploring this drug's antisuicidal effects on major depressive disorder patients, published from February 2000 to June 2023. Forty-six studies were included, identifying 16 assessment tools, mostly explicit and clinician-rated measures. Prominent tools included the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), and both the clinician and patient-rated Beck Scales for Suicide Ideation (SSI and BSS). With the exception of the Suicide Ideation and Behavior Assessment Tool (SIBAT), to the best of our knowledge, no other instrument that assesses suicidality seems to be specifically developed for measuring treatment response in rapid-acting antidepressants trials. Most scales have been validated in conventional antidepressant or psychotherapy contexts, though, for MADRS, as well as for SSI, BDI, and HAM-D, efforts have been made towards investigating their psychometric properties in the field of rapid-acting antidepressants. The heterogeneity of suicidal behavior assessment in ketamine studies may hinder adequate comparisons between them. Although there does not seem to be a universally preferable instrument for measuring suicidal behavior to date, the MADRS potentially emerges as an adequately recommended choice."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Eating disorders (EDs) significantly impair physical health and psychosocial functioning. Few effective therapeutic approaches exist for EDs, particularly in Anorexia Nervosa (AN). The use of ketamine, already characterized as a noncompetitive NMDA antagonist anesthetic in depression and suicidal ideations, could be an innovative adjuvant treatment for the AN spectrum. METHODS: We describe a case series of eight patients treated with intravenous Ketamine Adjuvant Treatment (KAT) combined with usual care. We also review the literature and discuss the theoretical mechanisms behind the influence of KAT in EDs. Our patients were all female, with a diagnosis of AN spectrum, and aged between 16 and 44. We offered KAT attempting to remodel rigid food-centered thoughts. Some sessions were guided by psychomotor or psychological support, thus working on self-image, body perceptions, self-esteem, and sensorial re-exposure to \"forbidden\" food. RESULTS: KAT significantly improved BMI, with a coefficient of 0.71 (0.23-1.20, p = 0.002), with a tendency to improve weight regain dynamics from the fourth or fifth infusion onwards. It could also reduce AN psychopathology and obsessive-compulsive-like symptoms (ruminations, cognitive rigidity, guilt), improving clinical evolution. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the potential of KAT as a therapeutic approach for restrictive EDs as an adjuvant treatment or after failure of first-line treatments. It particularly addresses rigid thought patterns and neurocognitive biases that are notoriously difficult to target. Ketamine's \"pro-plasticity\" and \"pro-neurogenesis\" properties may facilitate this effect. KAT represents a potential tool after failure of first-line treatments. Future research in controlled studies is imperative to corroborate its effect."

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Existing studies predominantly focus on the molecular and neurobiological mechanisms underlying Ketamine's acute treatment effects on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This emphasis has largely overlooked its sustained therapeutic effects, which hold significant potential for the development of targeted interventions. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review examines the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of ketamine on PTSD, differentiating between immediate and sustained molecular effects. METHOD: A comprehensive search across databases (Web of Science, Scopus, Global Health, PubMed) and grey literature yielded 317 articles, where 29 studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies included preclinical models and clinical trials, through neurotransmitter regulation, gene expression, synaptic plasticity, and neural pathways (PROSPERO ID: CRD42024582874). RESULTS: We found accumulating evidence that the immediate effects of ketamine, which involve changes in GABA, glutamate, and glutamine levels, trigger the re-regulation of BDNF, enhancing synaptic plasticity via pathways such as TrkB and PSD-95. Other molecular influences also include c-Fos, GSK-3, HDAC, HCN1, and the modulation of hormones like CHR and ACTH, alongside immune responses (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α). Sustained effects arise from neurotransmitter remodulations and involve prolonged changes in gene expression. These include mTOR-mediated BDNF expression, alterations in GSK-3β, FkBP5, GFAP, ERK phosphorylation, and epigenetic modifications (DNMT3, MeCP2, H3K27me3, mir-132, mir-206, HDAC). CONCLUSION: These molecular changes promote long-term synaptic stability and re-regulation in key brain regions, contributing to prolonged therapeutic benefits. Understanding the sustained molecular and epigenetic mechanisms behind ketamine's effects is critical for developing safe and effective personalised treatments, potentially leading to more effective recovery."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Gastrointestinal endoscopy is a frequent procedure for diagnosing and following up on various digestive disorders. It is often conducted under propofol sedation. The aim of this work is, first, to determine whether the addition of sufentanil, alfentanil, or ketamine to propofol has a propofol-sparing effect and, secondarily, how these drugs affect the patients' hemodynamic parameters and oxygenation as well as the duration of the procedure. METHODS: Data from patients who underwent colonoscopy were extracted from the anesthesia records database and divided into four groups. Patients received either propofol or a combination of propofol and sufentanil, alfentanil, or ketamine. After inverse propensity weighting, we determined the average treatment effects for each group for the primary and secondary endpoints. RESULTS: Sufentanil was associated with a less than 10% decrease in propofol consumption. Alfentanil and ketamine showed no propofol-sparing effect. Sufentanil was associated with 2 min shorter procedures. Alfentanil was associated with more patients presenting hypoxemia and had no propofol-sparing effect. CONCLUSION: Should a balanced sedation technique be chosen, sufentanil appears to be the adjuvant of choice, given its propofol-sparing effect and the absence of induced hypoxemia. A further prospective study is necessary to explain the lack of propofol-sparing effect of ketamine and alfentanil and confirm and explain the negative impact of alfentanil on patients' oxygenation.",

      "abstract": "Ketamine, a fast-acting antidepressant, is a racemic mixture, composed of equal amounts of R- and S-ketamine. Preclinical studies are comparing them to better understand their role in therapeutic and undesirable effects. An important research gap is that studies do not use long clinically relevant protocols to compare the desired and undesired effects of ketamine enantiomers in modeled and control animals. In our preclinical study, we explored the behavioral effects of R- and S-ketamine at 10 mg/kg in clinically relevant treatment protocol using Wistar-Kyoto rats as a depression model and Wistar rats as a control. Undesirable psychomotor effects were evaluated with locomotor stimulation and sensitization, ataxia, and stereotypy. Persistent effects associated with therapeutic outcomes were evaluated by measuring working memory, anxiety, and behavioral despair. We found that S-ketamine has stronger acute psychomotor effects compared to R-ketamine and that Wistar-Kyoto rats are more sensitive to these effects compared to Wistar rats. After repeated treatment, sensitization to locomotor stimulating effects, and tolerance to ataxic effects of S-ketamine develops. We found no persistent changes due to ketamine treatments. Taken together, our results may indicate that depressed patients would be more prone to negative side effects of ketamine, compared to healthy controls. However, after repeated treatment, tolerance to side effects may develop and make the treatment more tolerable. Future preclinical and clinical studies are needed to address neurobiological mechanisms and clinical relevance of higher sensitivity to the psychomotor effects of ketamine, and the development of tolerance to psychomotor effects of ketamine in depressed individuals.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ketamine abuse damages brain function and structure, increasing reactive oxygen species and apoptosis in the cerebral cortex, but moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) can enhance antioxidant defences and reduce apoptosis. Therefore, we aimed to answer whether MICT can reduce the side effects of chronic ketamine abuse. METHOD: 24 Wistar rats were split into control (CON), ketamine abuse (KET), exercise after ketamine withdrawal (KET + EX), and non-intervention ketamine withdrawal (KET + WD) groups. Ketamine intervention groups received 50 mg/kg/day ketamine for 8 weeks; KET + EX underwent 5 MICT sessions/week at 60-75% VO2max for 8 weeks post-withdrawal. Post-sampling of cerebral cortex, we evaluated histological changes, apoptotic cell numbers, Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3 mRNA/protein, 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (OXO) expression, glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione reductase (GR) mRNA and other oxidative stress and antioxidant markers levels. Effect sizes (ES) were used to assess group differences. RESULTS: MICT significantly reduced apoptotic cells (ES = 14.24, p < 0.0001), decreased Bax and caspase-3 protein expression, and increased Bcl-2 compared to the KET group (Bax: ES = 2.77, p = 0.005; caspase-3: ES = 7.73, p < 0.0001; Bcl-2: ES = 12.11, p < 0.001). It also lowered Bax and caspase-3 mRNA (Bax: ES = 4, p = 0.014; caspase-3: ES = 2.29, p = 0.024). MICT reduced OXO and increased GR and GPX mRNA and nitric oxide (NO) level (GR: ES = 2.02, p = 0.016; GPX: ES = 1.98, p = 0.035; OXO: ES = 11.39, p < 0.0001; NO: ES = 3.52, p = 0.003). Levels of malondialdehyde, myeloperoxidase, glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase remained unchanged between groups. CONCLUSION: MICT seems effective in reducing apoptosis and oxidative damage in the cerebral cortex of rats with long-term ketamine abuse.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: Despite the clinical benefits of ketamine in treating major depressive disorder (MDD), some patients exhibit drug resistance, and the intricate mechanisms underlying this await comprehensive explication. We used metabolomics to find biomarkers for ketamine efficacy and uncover its mechanisms of action. METHODS: The study included 40 MDD patients treated with ketamine in the discovery cohort and 24 patients in the validation cohort. Serum samples from the discovery cohort receiving ketamine were analyzed using ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to study metabolomic changes and identify potential biomarkers. Metabolic alterations were evaluated pre- and post-ketamine treatment. Spearman correlation was applied to examine the relationship between metabolite alterations and depressive symptom changes. In addition, potential biomarkers, particularly thyroxine, were investigated through quantitative measurements in the validation cohort. RESULTS: We found that energy metabolite changes (adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate [ADP], pyruvate) were different in responders versus non-responders. The magnitude of the ADP shift was strongly correlated with the rate of reduction in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores (Rho = 0.48, pFDR = 0.018). Additionally, baseline free triiodothyronine (FT3) levels are inversely associated with the rate of MADRS reduction (Rho = -0.645, p = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine ameliorates depressive symptoms by modulating metabolic pathways linked to energy metabolism. Low baseline FT3 levels appear to predict a positive response in MDD patients, suggesting FT3 has potential as a biological marker for clinical ketamine treatment.

      "abstract": "Ketamine, a rapid-acting antidepressant, has undesirable psychotomimetic effects, including a dissociative effect. There is currently no effective strategy to suppress these side effects while preserving its antidepressant effect. Here, we investigated the effects of a D2/D3 receptor antagonist and partial agonists on the psychotomimetic and antidepressant effects of ketamine in mice and humans. Aripiprazole, a partial agonist, attenuated the psychotomimetic effect, but maintaining and even enhancing the antidepressant-like effect of ketamine in the forced swim test, whereas raclopride, an antagonist, suppressed both effects in mice. Brain-wide Fos mapping and its network analysis suggested the ventral tegmental area (VTA) as a critical region for distinguishing the effects of aripiprazole and raclopride. In the chronic stress model, local infusion of raclopride into the VTA inhibited ketamine's antidepressant-like effect, accompanied by activation of dopaminergic neurons, suggesting the inhibitory effect of VTA activation on the antidepressant-like effect of ketamine. Consistently, systemic injections of raclopride and brexpiprazole, a partial agonist similar to aripiprazole but closer to an antagonist (lower Emax), activated dopaminergic neurons in the VTA and suppressed ketamine's antidepressant-like effect in the model when co-administered with ketamine, whereas aripiprazole didn't. In line with these results, in a single-arm, double-blinded clinical study of sequential treatments in depressed patients (N = 9), co-administration of 12 mg of aripiprazole suppressed the dissociative symptoms induced by ketamine while maintaining its antidepressant effects. Together, these findings suggest that fine-tuning dopamine receptor signaling with aripiprazole allows selective suppression of ketamine-induced dissociation preserving its antidepressant effects, and that the combined use of aripiprazole and ketamine may be a preferred therapy for treatment-resistant depression.",

Therefore, novel interventions such as ketamine therapy have gained interest as potentially efficacious options, known to generate unique psychotherapeutic experiences. The present secondary analysis examines the acute subjective experiences-both quantitatively and qualitatively-of clinical trial participants with AUD who received intravenous (IV) ketamine therapy in the hospital setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among a subset of inpatient clinical trial participants with AUD who received IV ketamine therapy (n = 12), acceptability and tolerability were assessed. Next, a brief directed content analysis was performed, utilizing textual data transcribed immediately after ketamine infusion. Six preselected themes from the literature were chosen to apply to our text. RESULTS: Among this sample, IV ketamine therapy appeared well tolerated and highly acceptable (mean 9.5 on 0-10 Likert scale). The mean Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) score was 21.7 (out of max 92). It seemed to occasion experiences that were largely positive, transporting, visual, and meaningful. The most frequently assigned themes in our data set were \"Meaningful, spiritual, and mystical experiences,\" \"Positive affect,\" and \"Inherent contradictions of the acute experience.\" CONCLUSIONS: Prior themes derived from two theory-generating publications applied widely to our participants' reported experiences. The hospital setting itself did not appear to be a barrier in facilitating these experiences."

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KAP) is an emerging treatment option to alleviate treatment-resistant affective disorders, but its long-term effectiveness remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To examine the treatment effects of KAP on anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at 1, 3, and 6 months post-treatment. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective effectiveness study included self-reported outcomes from adults with a history of major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or PTSD who had not responded to prior treatment interventions and received KAP administered across 11 Field Trip Health clinics in North America between March 13, 2020, and June 16, 2022. The evaluable sample sizes were 346 and 94 participants at 3 and 6 months, respectively, representing loss to follow-up rates of 82% and 95%. INTERVENTION: KAP consists of 4-6 guided ketamine sessions (administered through intramuscular injection or sublingual lozenge) with psychotherapy-only integration visits after doses 1 and 2 and then after every 2 subsequent doses. Mean number of doses administered was 4, standard deviation (SD) = 3, and mean number of integration sessions was 3, SD = 2. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were changes in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD at 3 months relative to baseline, assessed, respectively, using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item GAD measure, and the 6-item PTSD checklist. Secondary outcomes were changes at 1 and 6 months relative to baseline. RESULTS: Large treatment effects were detected at 3 months (d's = 0.75-0.86) and were sustained at 6 months (d's = 0.61-0.73). Case reductions (identified based on cutoff values) ranged from 39% to 41% at 3 months and 29% to 37% at 6 months. In total, 50-75% reported a minimal clinically important difference at 3 months and 48-70% at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: KAP produced sustained reductions in anxiety, depression, and PTSD, with symptom improvement lasting well beyond the duration of dosing and integration sessions. These effects extended to as much as 5 months after the last KAP session. However, the high rates of attrition may limit validity of the results. Given the growing mental health care crises and the need for effective therapies and models of care, especially for intractable psychiatric mood-related disorders, these data support the use of KAP as a viable alternative. Further prospective clinical research should be undertaken to provide evidence on the safety and effectiveness of ketamine within a psychotherapeutic context."

      "abstract": "This systematic review synthesizes current evidence on non-prescribed ketamine use, emphasizing its neurobiological impacts and psychotherapeutic interventions. Patterns of misuse demonstrate the complex interplay of neurobiological, socio-economic, demographic and psychological factors with adolescents, women and polysubstance users identified as high-risk groups. Neurobiological findings highlight prefrontal-limbic dysconnectivity, maladaptive neuroplasticity alongside hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation as central mechanisms underlying this addiction. The review evaluates the comparative efficacy of psychotherapies whilst proposing an innovative framework that aligns therapeutic timing with neuroplastic recovery phases. Emerging evidence identifies biomarkers, e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and heart rate variability (HRV), as promising tools for guiding personalized and phase-specific interventions. Gaps in research include the limited representation of low-resource settings and insufficient longitudinal data on biomarker integration and therapy sequencing. Recommendations propose a comprehensive neurobiologically informed model which carefully integrates digital platforms, culturally tailored strategies and biomarkers to enhance treatment outcomes."

However, the direct effects of matching treatment with patient preference on efficacy and safety outcomes remain unclear. We aimed to evaluate the effects of patient preference and preference-matching on efficacy, adverse events, and adherence to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and intravenous (IV) ketamine treatments in a randomized clinical trial. METHODS: Data were collected during the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) funded ECT vs. Ketamine in Patients with Treatment Resistant Depression (ELEKT-D) study, which randomized patients to treatment with either ECT or IV ketamine across five U.S. sites. We performed post hoc-analyses on 255 patients who provided responses to a patient preference survey following treatment phase completion, which allowed us to explore the relationships between treatment preference and several treatment outcome measures. RESULTS: Our analysis showed that (1) Ketamine was preferred by more trial participants than ECT; (2) Preference for ketamine was associated with higher likelihood of treatment response for all patients regardless of treatment assignment; (3) Preference-matching (patients receiving the treatment they indicated a moderate or strong preference for on the survey) was associated with greater likelihood of treatment response to ketamine but not ECT; (4) Preference-matching was associated with reduced rates of adverse events in ECT-treated patients. There was a trend for preference-matching potentially influencing treatment adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest treatment preference-matching affects treatment effectiveness, adverse event reporting and possibly adherence. However, these associations may be contextual, modality dependent, and complex.",

The lack of emergency physician awareness regarding ketamine-induced abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and dysuria, collectively and colloquially known as K-cramps, results in delayed recognition, underreporting, and inappropriate diagnostic workup and treatment. A 25-year-old woman with a history of anxiety, asthma, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and chronic high-dose (500-1000 milligrams weekly) ketamine use presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant, epigastric, and suprapubic regions, along with nausea, vomiting, and dysuria. Physical exam revealed localized abdominal tenderness but no other significant findings. Lab results including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, lipase, beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, and urinalysis were normal. Given the patient's reported symptoms and frequent, chronic, and high-dose ketamine use, the diagnosis of ketamine-induced abdominal pain and dysuria, or K-cramps, was made. The patient was treated with intravenous fluids, antiemetics, and benzodiazepines. Upon reassessment, all symptoms resolved, and the patient passed an oral challenge. She was discharged with prescriptions for antiemetics and provided with a referral to addiction medicine. Ketamine-induced abdominal cramping and dysuria, or K-cramps, are scarcely reported in the medical literature but are widely known among chronic users. Treatment in the acute care setting includes a comprehensive history and physical examination, consideration and workup of alternative causes, symptom management, counseling regarding harm reduction, and a referral to addiction medicine resources."

      "abstract": "Nitrous oxide is a common gaseous anesthetic used in a wide range of medical procedures due to its desirable combination of anesthetic and analgesic properties. Deep brain stimulation surgery, a well-established treatment for movement disorders like Parkinson's disease, often requires precise microelectrode recordings of the awake brain's electrical signals for optimal results. However, the influence of anesthetics on these brain signals remains a critical consideration. This study investigated how nitrous oxide general anesthesia supplemented by ketamine affects the electrophysiology of the subthalamic nucleus compared to awake and low-dose ketamine sedation during deep brain stimulation procedures targeting the subthalamic nucleus of Parkinson's disease patients. Spectral analysis of subthalamic nucleus electrophysiological characteristics and statistical analysis of its electrophysiological dimensions were performed on retrospective data from three medical centers. Our findings revealed that nitrous-ketamine general anesthesia allows electrophysiological subthalamic nucleus identification, despite a slight decrease in overall activity level. Nevertheless, nitrous-ketamine showed significantly lower beta frequency power inside the nucleus compared to the ketamine and awake groups. At the group level, and in many trajectories, delineation of subthalamic nucleus subdomains can be achieved by detection of changes in the delta frequency oscillations. Notably, no differences in electrophysiological nucleus dimensions were found between the three groups. These findings suggest that it is possible to recognize the entrance and exit of the subthalamic nucleus with high confidence under nitrous oxide-ketamine anesthesia. However, the motor subregion of the nucleus is more difficult to delineate under nitrous anesthesia than ketamine sedation or awake, which may affect outcome.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Canadian Special Operation Forces Command (CANSOFCOM) operators have been extensively deployed in recent conflicts. They are at risk of trauma and blast exposure as well as the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and blast traumatic brain injury (bTBI). Current psychotherapy and pharmacological approaches provide suboptimal resolution of PTSD and bTBI symptoms. Prior research has shown that ketamine infusion and cervical sympathetic blockade (CSB) have reduced PTSD and bTBI symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 11 patients, including CANSOFCOM members, were treated and followed. Pre- and post-intervention PTSD Checklist-5 and Neurobehavioral Inventory Scale (NSI) scores were recorded. Neurobehavioral Inventory Scale questionnaire was administered only to patients with a history of traumatic brain injury. Each patient received 4 ketamine infusion and bilateral CSB treatments, as per previously published by IRB protocol #00000971. RESULT: Two weeks post-intervention, average PTSD Checklist score reduction of 45.09 (n = 11). Two weeks post-intervention, average NSI score reduction of 40.7 (87.0% reduction) (n = 6). No other NSI scores were available. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the importance of early intervention and ongoing evaluation in PTSD treatment. Ketamine infusion combined with bilateral CSB can provide a clinically significant reduction of PTSD and bTBI in the CANSOFCOM cohort. Of interest, another study of CSB alone as a treatment of bTBI, which used NSI assessment, showed a reduction of 53% on a 1-month follow-up. Our report demonstrated an 87% reduction in NSI score at 2 weeks. Possible physiological explanations and study limitations are discussed."

      "abstract": "Ketamine, a substance used for anesthesia and known for inducing dissociation, can lead to addiction and the development of severe withdrawal symptoms. Ketamine alters brain networks before affecting somesthetic sensation. Ketamine abuse was especially prevalent in East and Southeast Asia, and its popularity has continued to expand globally in recent decades. Ketamine is gaining popularity in the public and private sectors as a cheaper off-label depression treatment. Unfortunately, ketamine may cause side effects, such as heart and blood vessel instability, respiratory depression, liver injury, hallucinations, etc. The pain-relieving and mental effects of ketamine might induce reliance; thus, it should be used cautiously. This review highlights the neurobiological processes underpinnings of ketamine's addictive potential, withdrawal, and its effects on brain networks like the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and mesolimbic pathway, which play vital roles in decision-making, memory, and reward processing. In addition, the involvement of neurotransmitter systems, specifically glutamate and dopamine, in mediating the addictive properties of ketamine and the neuroadaptive changes that occurred during withdrawal are also discussed. It also explains that low-dose ketamine can alter the secretion of stress hormone cortisol and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation, possibly attributed to the current repurposing study of ketamine as a fast-acting antidepressant. Understanding these pathways is essential for developing effective ketamine addiction treatments, managing withdrawal symptoms, and possibly reversing brain changes for the betterment of human health and psychological well- being."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This placebo-controlled, randomized study was carried out in 84 American Society of Anesthesiologists II patients, aged 18-70 years, of either gender, undergoing elective open GI malignancy surgeries. Patients received intraoperative infusion of ketamine @ 0.1 mg kg-1 h-1 (KET), dexmedetomidine @ 0.25 μg kg-1 h-1 (DEX), or normal saline (placebo). Primary outcome was the time to first flatus and/or stool. Secondary outcomes included time to extubation, total analgesic requirement, postoperative pain scores, time to feeds, duration of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay, and the incidence of adverse events. Continuous data were analyzed by the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or the Kruskal-Wallis test. Categorical data were analyzed by the Chi-square test or the Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Median time to passage of flatus and/or stool was 3 [interquartile range (IQR) 2-3] days in the KET group, 2 [IQR 2-3] days in the DEX group, and 2 [IQR 2-3] days in the placebo group (P = 0.53 for placebo vs. KET, 0.81 for placebo vs. DEX, and 0.99 for KET vs. DEX). Pain scores and analgesic consumption were significantly less in the intervention groups versus placebo (P < 0.001). No difference was seen in other secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION: Low-dose ketamine or dexmedetomidine did not result in early bowel recovery despite lower pain scores and opioid consumption in patients undergoing open GI malignancy surgeries."

We describe the first active-controlled randomized clinical trial of oral racemic ketamine for suicidal ideation associated with depression. METHODS: Adult patients with major depressive disorder and expressed suicidal ideation were randomized to receive a single session of oral racemic ketamine (3 mg/kg; n = 40) or oral midazolam (0.3 mg/kg; n = 40). Suicidal ideation was rated using the Modified Scale for Suicidal Ideation (MSSI) and depression, using the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). Patients were assessed 4 h post-treatment (Day 1) and on Days 3 and 7. RESULTS: Mean doses were 180 mg and 1.8 mg for ketamine and midazolam, respectively. MSSI scores were significantly lower in the ketamine group at all assessment points: 4 h, Day 3, and Day 7. HAM-D scores were significantly lower in the ketamine group at 4 h and on Day 3. The study-defined HAM-D response and remission rates were 25 % vs 0 % and 5 % vs 0 % in ketamine vs midazolam groups on Day 7. Nausea/vomiting, lightness of body, emotional disturbance (anxiety or crying), and depersonalization/derealization were significantly more frequent in the ketamine group; however, no patient considered these to be of treatment-limiting severity. CONCLUSIONS: Oral racemic ketamine is a reasonably well-tolerated and rapidly effective intervention for suicidal ideation and depression in adults with major depressive disorder.",

The mismatch negativity (MMN) is reliant on glutamatergic neurotransmission and reduced by NMDAR antagonists. The MMN may characterise the neural mechanisms underlying ketamine's effects. AIMS: This study examined the acute effects of ketamine and midazolam on the MMN and its relationship to early and sustained decreases in depressive symptoms. METHODS: Treatment-resistant MDD patients (N = 24), enrolled in a multi-phase clinical ketamine trial, received two intravenous infusions within an initial double-blind crossover phase: ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) and midazolam (30 μg/kg). Three recordings were carried out per session (pre-, immediately post- and 2 h post-infusion). Peak MMN amplitude (μV), latency (ms), theta event-related oscillations (EROs), theta phase locking factor (PLF) and source-localised MMN generator activity were assessed. Relationships between changes in MMN indices and early (Phase 1: double-blind, cross-over phase) and sustained (Phases 2, 3: open-label repeated and maintenance phases, respectively) changes in depressive symptoms (Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score) were examined. RESULTS: Ketamine reduced frontal MMN amplitudes, theta ERO immediately post- and 2 h post-infusion and source-localised peak MMN frontal generator activity. Select baseline and ketamine-induced MMN decreases correlated and predicted greater early (left frontal MMN decreases in amplitude and theta ERO, baseline left PLF) and sustained (baseline left PLF, right inferior temporal activity) symptom reductions. CONCLUSIONS: Acute NMDARs blockade reduced frontal MMN, with larger MMN reductions predicting greater symptom improvement. The MMN may serve as a non-invasive biomarker predicting antidepressant response to glutamatergic agents."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To review the current literature on ketamine-associated upper urinary tract (UUT) dysfunction and provide an overview of its pathogenesis and treatment principles. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using PubMed and Cochrane databases for relevant articles published in English between 2008 and 2023. Keywords used included \"ketamine\" and \"upper urinary tract\". RESULTS: A total of 22 papers were included. Relatively few studies have focused on ketamine-associated UUT dysfunction. Exclusion criteria included lack of hydronephrosis, or pathological findings. After careful screening and exclusion, we finally adopted 11 of these papers and analyzed them. Ketamine-associated UUT dysfunction may be a concern in this field. CONCLUSION: Ketamine abuse can lead to UUT impairment and dysfunction, with symptoms such as bladder dysfunction and contracted bladder with vesicoureteral reflux, direct damage and barrier dysfunction, inflammation, apoptosis, fibrosis and stricture, and papillary necrosis. Oxidative stress, autophagy, and microvascular injury are also potential pathogenic mechanisms. The detection of these symptoms largely depends on laboratory and imaging examinations. The treatment principles of ketamine-associated UUT dysfunction are protecting the UUT, improving bladder dysfunction, and resuming normal social life. More investigations are needed to clarify the mechanisms and shed light on the treatment of ketamine-associated UUT damage."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Appropriate use and timing of agents for chemical management of patient agitation is critical for the safety of patients and providers. Ketamine may have a preferable safety profile in acutely agitated patients, especially those with an unknown medication history given that it does not carry the same cardiovascular and respiratory risks as other sedative agents currently used in practice. This study aimed to evaluate subsequent chemical sedation requirements and the incidence of adverse events following the use of ketamine for agitation as compared to combination antipsychotic/sedative use in the ED. METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-center, observational cohort study of 102 adult patients who received chemical sedation for agitation/aggression/combative behavior from January 2018 to December 2023 at the Mount Sinai Medical Center Emergency Department. Patients who received at least one dose of ketamine (n = 51) were compared to patients who received at least one dose of the B52 combination (diphenhydramine (Benadryl) 25 mg, haloperidol (Haldol) 5 mg, and lorazepam (Ativan) 2 mg) (n = 51) for management of aggression. The primary endpoint was restricted mean survival time (RMST) to next sedative given. Secondary endpoints included the number of additional sedatives needed, adverse events, and length of stay. RESULTS: The use of ketamine was associated with patients requiring additional sedation both more often and sooner than patients who received the B52 combination (RMST to next sedative: 2.1 hours ketamine vs 4 hours B52; p = 0.032, median additional doses: 3 doses ketamine group vs 0 doses B52 group; p < 0.00). CONCLUSION: In agitated patients within the ED, the administration of ketamine demonstrated inadequate duration of sedation and increased need for supplemental sedative use compared to B52."

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder ranking among the top ten global disability causes. In rodents, sub-chronic or chronic ketamine treatment is used for the induction of schizophrenia. Ketamine affects the function of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the most important neurotrophin involved in the pathophysiology of different neuropsychiatric disorders. The present systematic review aimed to investigate BDNF changes in rodent studies used ketamine-induced schizophrenia. PubMed electronic database was searched and 44 articles were found. After removal of unrelated articles, 17 articles were selected. The results showed a wide range of inconsistent changes in BDNF levels. We found that sub-chronic and chronic ketamine treatment in rats decreased BDNF or had no effect. Sub-chronic and chronic ketamine treatment in mice only decreased BDNF. However, increased BDNF was commonly observed following acute ketamine treatment. These results showed the possible role of species and the duration of treatment. Also, sex can also be involved in BDNF changes because one study showed inconsistent BDNF changes in male and female rats. In conclusion, we found that ketamine's effects may depend on factors such as duration of administration, sex, and species. Therefore, the wide range of BDNF changes may be related to high variability in methods. Because of this variability, there is currently no standardized method for using ketamine as a rodent model for schizophrenia. Further research is needed to establish a standardized pharmacological model of schizophrenia using ketamine treatment."

Methods: From November 2023 to January 2024, 66 adult patients (41 males and 25 females) scheduled for suspension laryngoscopic surgery in Beijing Tongren Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University were enrolled, with age of (49.6±11.1) years and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade Ⅰ-Ⅱ. The patients were divided into two groups using a random number table method: treatment group (n=33) and control group (n=33). Patients in the treatment group received 0.25 mg/kg s-ketamine intravenously after induction, and the control group received the same volume of normal saline. The main outcomes included the incidence of cough response and moderate to severe cough response during extubation. The secondary outcomes included heart rate and mean arterial pressure (MAP) at the time of entering the operation room (T0), before intubation (T1), 1 min after intubation (T2), 1 min after suspending laryngoscope (T3), 5 min after suspending laryngoscope (T4), at the end of surgery (T5), and immediately after intubation (T6). Extubation time, the modified Aldrete scores on entering and exiting post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), length of stay in PACU, the numerical rating scale (NRS) scores on exiting PACU and 6 h after surgery and adverse events were also recorded. Results: There were no significant differences in age, gender, ASA grade, body mass index and operation time between the two groups (P>0.05). The incidence of cough response and moderate to severe cough response in the treatment group was 39.4% (13/33) and 12.1% (4/33), respectively. They were significantly lower than those in the control group [66.7% (22/33), 36.4% (12/33)] (all P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the changes of heart rate and MAP between the two groups at any time point (P>0.05). There were no significant differences in extubation time, the modified Aldrete scores on entering and exiting PACU, length of stay in PACU and NRS scores on exiting PACU and 6 h after surgery between the two groups (all P>0.05). No adverse events such as increased secretions, laryngospasm, agitation, nightmare, hallucination, blurred vision and headache were observed in either group. Conclusion: Infusion of low-dose s-ketamine can effectively alleviate cough response in patients undergoing suspension laryngoscopic surgery during extubation period and has no effect on intraoperative hemodynamics, postoperative recovery, or adverse events.",

STUDY DESIGN: Partially randomized, crossover, experimental study. ANIMALS: A group of six healthy male neutered cats, aged 1-2 years, weighing 5.4 ± 0.3 kg. METHODS: Each cat was administered six treatments: dexmedetomidine (25 μg kg-1; D) + vatinoxan (600 μg kg-1; V) + ketamine (2.5 mg kg-1; K2.5) intramuscularly (IM) (DVK2.5IM); D + V + ketamine (5 mg kg-1; K5) IM (DVK5IM); D + V + ketamine (10 mg kg-1; K10) IM (DVK10IM); D + K5 IM (DK5IM); D + V + K5 subcutaneously (SC) (DVK5SC); or D + V + K5 intravenously (IV) (DVK5IV). Venous blood samples were collected before treatment injection, and at various times up to 6 hours thereafter. Plasma dexmedetomidine, vatinoxan and ketamine concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Compartment models were fitted to the time-plasma dexmedetomidine, vatinoxan and ketamine data using nonlinear mixed effect modeling, including covariates for the effects of vatinoxan and the dose of ketamine where appropriate. RESULTS: Two-compartment models best fitted the time-plasma dexmedetomidine, vatinoxan and ketamine concentrations. The models predicted that vatinoxan increases the clearance of dexmedetomidine and decreases the bioavailability of IM ketamine and that increasing doses of ketamine increase the volume of the central compartment for dexmedetomidine and the bioavailability of IM ketamine. The volume of distribution at steady state (mL kg-1) and metabolic clearance (mL minute-1 kg-1) were 1012-2429 and 12.5-15.4 for dexmedetomidine, 666 and 3.7 for vatinoxan and 2260 and 23.8 for ketamine, respectively. Bioavailability (%) for IM and SC dexmedetomidine, vatinoxan and ketamine was 83 and 95, 99 and 95 and 60-100 and 100, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine and the bioavailability of ketamine were affected by vatinoxan and the dose of ketamine."

A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases up to November 2024. The randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of ketamine and ECT in MDD patients were included. Pooled standardized mean differences (SMD) and risk ratios (RR) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals. The Cochrane's Risk of Bias Tool was employed to assess study quality. Six studies encompassing 643 patients were analyzed. No significant difference was observed in depression symptom severity scores between ketamine and ECT groups (SMD: -0.02, 95% CI: -0.53 to 0.48, P = 0.92). Response rates also showed no significant difference between the two interventions (RR: 1.08, 95% CI: 0.67 to 1.72, P = 0.76). Notably, ketamine demonstrated superior memory function improvement compared to ECT (SMD: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.64 to 2.48, P < 0.001). In terms of adverse events, ketamine was associated with significantly higher rates of dissociative symptoms, blurred vision, and dizziness(all P < 0.001), while demonstrating a lower incidence of muscle pain(P < 0.001). The meta-analysis revealed ketamine as a non-inferior therapeutic option for patients with major depressive disorder, with potential advantages in memory function. While promising, the limited number of included studies necessitates further large-scale randomized controlled trials using standardized assessment scales to validate these findings."

      "abstract": "Ketamine has received growing attention for its effects on neuroplasticity and neuroinflammation, and as a treatment for depression and other mental health disorders. Recent evidence suggests that early sensory and behavioral deficits in Alzheimer's disease could be caused by synaptic disruption that occurs before irreversible neuropathology. This raises the possibility that ketamine could slow down or prevent network disruption and the ensuing sensory and behavioral deficits in Alzheimer's. Here we tested this idea in the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's, using either an acute single injection of ketamine, or chronic daily injections over 15 weeks. We tested the effects of ketamine on both amyloid plaque load and on a behavioral auditory gap detection task that is an early Alzheimer's biomarker in both mice and humans. We found that ketamine had no effect on plaque load, nor any effect on gap detection, for either acute or chronic dosing. Chronic ketamine facilitated startle responses specifically in 5XFAD mice, but this could simply be related to experience-dependent effects on stress or habituation rather than any rescue effect of ketamine on Alzheimer's-related deficits. We did find robust correlations between gap detection deficits and plaque load in auditory cortex and in the caudal pontine reticular nucleus, demonstrating that the behavioral deficits seen in 5XFAD mice are directly related to amyloid accumulation in these brain regions, and confirming the validity of gap detection as an early biomarker of Alzheimer's. Ketamine, however, had no effect on the strength of these correlations. We conclude that ketamine has no beneficial effect on the development of behavioral gap detection deficits or plaque load in the 5XFAD Alzheimer's mouse model, following either an acute single dose or a chronic daily dose regimen."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Ketamine demonstrates robust and rapidly occurring antidepressant effects in patients with difficult-to-treat major depressive disorder. Ketamine's antidepressant effects and its impact on functional networks in non-resistant forms of major depressive disorder are expected to provide valuable insight into ketamine's mechanism of action related to depression. METHODS: This study employs an existing network model of major depressive disorder to investigate the effects of ketamine on resting state connectivity in a therapy-non-resistant major depressive disorder population. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 0.5 mg/kg racemic ketamine or 0.9%NaCl was administered intravenously in 16 MDD patients. We applied resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to explore changes in functional brain connectivity directly at 50, 80 and 165 min (acute) and 24 h (delayed) following ketamine administration. A clinician-rated 10-item scale (MADRS) was administered at 165 min and 24 h after ketamine administration. Connections-of-interest (COIs) were based on the previously published corticolimbic-insular-striatalpallidal-thalamic (CLIPST) circuitry model of major depressive disorder. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, ketamine significantly (p < 0.0014) reduced the mean (SD) MADRS total score from 21.2 (5.9) pre-dose to 10.3 (4.6) 24 h post-dose. At both acute (p < 0.0172) and delayed (p < 0.0488) time points, significant rs-fMRI connectivity changes occurred only in MDD-related COIs as proposed by the CLIPST model. No changes in functional connectivity were found in non-CLIPST connections. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates that ketamine specifically affects depression-related circuitry. Analyzing functional connectivity based on a neurocircuitry model of a specific CNS disease and drug action may be an effective approach that could result in a more targeted analysis in future pharmaco-fMRI studies in CNS drug development."

      "abstract": "Abnormalities during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep contribute to the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD), but few studies have explored the relationship between REM sleep and treatment-resistant depression (TRD). In MDD, REM sleep abnormalities often manifest as alterations in total night REM Density (RD), RD in the first REM period (RD1), and REM Latency (RL). Among these, RD1 is notably considered a potential endophenotype of depression. This study compared REM sleep markers between 63 drug-free individuals with TRD (39 F/24 M) and 41 healthy volunteers (25 F/16 M). It also investigated the effects of ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, on these REM sleep variables. Specifically, the study investigated whether RD1 could predict antidepressant response to ketamine. TRD participants showed higher RD1 and shorter RL at baseline compared to HVs, as assessed via non-parametric tests, but Total Night RD did not differ between the two groups. Ketamine treatment decreased RD1 in TRD participants but did not affect Total Night RD or RL. As assessed via the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, baseline RD1 level moderately predicted antidepressant response to ketamine versus non-response (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) = 0.73, with a median accuracy of 0.75), wherein TRD participants with higher baseline RD1 were more likely to respond to ketamine. These results underscore the utility of RD1 for identifying individuals most likely to benefit from ketamine treatment, enabling more targeted and effective therapeutic strategies.

      "abstract": "Ketamine, a dissociative anaesthetic, has expanded its clinical use beyond anaesthesia to pain management and treatment-resistant depression. As an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, ketamine disrupts the excitatory neurotransmission via interaction with the opioid, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isooxazole-propionic acid receptor and serotonin pathways, contributing to its broad therapeutic potential. However, its use is not without risks. In patients with insulin resistance, ketamine's effect on glucose metabolism, mitochondrial function and oxidative stress are exacerbated. This paper explores ketamine's pharmacokinetics, cardiovascular impact and its cellular effects on cardiomyocytes, particularly in insulin-resistant individuals. The findings discussed emphasize the importance of careful administration and monitoring in these vulnerable populations to balance ketamine's therapeutic benefits against its potential risks in patients with underlying metabolic or cardiovascular conditions.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a single infusion of ketamine in inducing rapid remission of severe suicidal ideation, compared to Midazolam, in a population with acute suicidal thoughts. In a double-blind randomized controlled trial conducted in Tehran, Iran, from January to July 2022 (IRCT20220118053756N1), 36 inpatients with acute severe suicidal ideation were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or Midazolam (0.02 mg/kg). Suicidality was assessed using the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSSI) and the Suicide-Visual Analog Scale (S-VAS) before the intervention and at 12 and 24 h post-administration. RESULTS: At baseline, the Midazolam group exhibited significantly higher BSSI scores and a higher rate of borderline personality disorder than the Ketamine group. Mean BSSI and S-VAS scores at 12 and 24 h after the treatment decreased significantly compared to baseline in both groups. Despite these observations, no statistically significant differences were found between the groups in terms of BSSI and S-VAS scores. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The protocol for this RCT was registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT). The trial registration details are as follows: IRCT registration number IRCT20220118053756N1, with the registration date being June 12, 2022 (1401/03/22). It is important to note that this trial was retrospectively registered.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Methamphetamine use disorder is a significant public health concern. No pharmacological treatment options currently exist for methamphetamine use disorder, and psychotherapy is only moderately effective. Preliminary evidence suggests that ketamine-assisted psychotherapy produces sustained improvements in substance use and mental health symptomatology. In addition to direct antidepressant properties, ketamine is hypothesised to increase synaptogenesis and facilitate neuroplasticity, in turn prolonging and enhancing the effects of psychotherapy. Given the withdrawal-associated dysphoria and neurocognitive impairments characterising methamphetamine use disorder, ketamine-assisted psychotherapy may improve the efficacy of psychotherapy alone by addressing these features and facilitating therapeutic engagement. This pilot study aims to investigate the safety and feasibility (time taken to recruit sample, proportion of ineligible participants at pre-screening and screening, number of participants who complete four sessions of psychotherapy, retention rate over full duration of study, acceptability of the intervention) of subanaesthetic ketamine in combination with psychotherapy (cognitive behavioural therapy) for adults with methamphetamine use disorder. Changes in methamphetamine use, cravings and withdrawal, quality of life, and treatment satisfaction will also be explored. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an open-label, single-arm clinical trial. 20 adults meeting DSM-5-TR criteria for methamphetamine use disorder who are seeking to reduce or cease methamphetamine use will be enrolled in the study through a single-site specialist outpatient stimulant treatment service in inner Sydney (St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney). A 4-week course with three subcutaneous ketamine doses (0.75 mg/kg to 0.9 mg/kg, titrated according to tolerability) at weekly intervals and four sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy (one at treatment initiation and three within 24-48 hours following each ketamine administration session) will be delivered. Safety and feasibility will be assessed over an 8-week period. Secondary outcomes (changes in methamphetamine use, cravings, withdrawal, quality of life and treatment satisfaction) will be assessed over a 24-week period. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the St Vincent's Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee, reference 2023/ETH00530. Study findings will be disseminated through articles in scientific, peer-reviewed journals, and at national and international conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ANZCTR: ACTRN12624000895583. PROTOCOL VERSION: The trial protocol (Version 4.0) was approved on 24 June 2024.",

Although advances have been made in understanding ketamine's antidepressant pharmacological and molecular mechanisms of action, the large-scale neurocognitive mechanisms driving its therapeutic effects are less clearly understood. To help provide such a framework, we provide a synthesis of current evidence linking ketamine treatment to the modulation of brain systems supporting reward processing, interoception, and self-related cognition. We suggest that ketamine's antidepressant effects are, at least in part, driven by dynamic multi-level influences across these key functional domains.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression (PPD) is categorized by the Disorders-Fifth Edition as depression that begins during pregnancy or within the first month after giving birth. Ketamine and esketamine have shown promising results in the treatment of several depressive disorders, which suggests that they may have a role in the prevention of PPD. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to update evidence about the efficacy and safety of using ketamine and esketamine to reduce PPD incidence. METHODS: We searched four databases, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane, to collect relevant studies. We included studies which investigated the preventive effect of ketamine or esketamine on PPD among women after giving birth through caesarean or vaginal delivery. We extracted PPD occurrence rate, PPD score, pain score and side effects. Finally, a meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan software. RESULTS: Twenty-one eligible studies were incorporated in the current systematic review and meta-analysis involving 4,389 pregnant women. Esketamine was the intervention in 14 studies, and ketamine was used in 7 studies. In subgroup analysis, both ketamine and esketamine were significantly effective in reducing the incidence of short-term PPD (ketamine: RR = 0.72, 95% CI [0.56, 0.93], P = 0.01; esketamine: RR = 0.43, P < 0.0001). Esketamine only significantly reduced the incidence of long-term PPD (RR = 0.44, P < 0.00001). Low doses and high doses were effective in reducing the incidence of both short-term (high dose: RR = 0.48, P = 0.0005; low dose: RR = 0.46, P = 0.002) and long-term PPD (high dose: RR = 0.54, P < 0.0001; low dose: RR = 0.61, P = 0.009). Regarding the risk of side effects, patients in the Ketamine/esketamine group showed statistically significant higher rates of developing dizziness (P = 0.0007), blurred vision (P = 0.02), vomiting (P = 0.004) and hallucinations (P = 0,002) than women in the control group. CONCLUSION: Both ketamine and esketamine are effective in lowering the incidence of short-term PPD. On the other hand, only esketamine is effective in reducing the incidence of long-term PPD. It is recommended to use smaller doses for a more tolerable treatment period since doses less than 0.5 mg are significantly effective. Temporary side effects such as dizziness, blurred vision, vomiting and hallucinations were reported.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Suicide is a global public health problem with few empirically supported treatments. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of clinical trials (CT) since 2020 of racemic ketamine or one of its enantiomers' (R/S) potential to reduce suicidal ideation or behavior (SIB). An initial PubMed search on April 15th, 2024 yielded 2483 results. 104 relevant CTs were identified. An additional search using other search engines on March 19th, 2024 yielded 52 sources. After screening, 14 RCTs met the inclusion criteria which required clinically significant SIB among participants, ketamine or one of its enantiomers as an anti-SIB treatment, and SIB as an outcome. We excluded neuroimaging studies, meta-analyses, reviews, and case reports. Open-label studies were also excluded except in the case of R-ketamine where we included 2 open trials due to limited published data for this enantiomer, yielding a total of 16 CTs. We used the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for the RCTs. CTs reviewed had suicidal ideation (SI) but none had suicidal behavior as an outcome. RESULTS: The studies include ketamine augmentation of other treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), various routes of administration - intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), and intranasal (IN) - and single versus multiple dose designs. Multiple doses of IV ketamine/S-ketamine produced reductions in SI for periods of several days to weeks, while single doses showed shorter, more variable effects. Multiple and single doses of IN ketamine/S-ketamine and single doses of IV ketamine produced less consistent anti-SI results. IN and IV ketamine/S-ketamine administration appears to be well tolerated. R-ketamine appears to produce fewer side effects, but additional clinical research is needed to clarify its antidepressant and anti-SI effects in humans. CONCLUSION: This review affirms the time-limited, anti-SI effects of ketamine and the need for personalized treatment. Limitations include study heterogeneity, small samples, and paucity of data for suicidal behavior or R-ketamine.",

DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Embase were searched from the earliest date through November 27, 2023. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of ketamine + ECT versus nonketamine anesthesia + ECT that reported data on remission (odds ratio [OR]), defined as a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and Montgomery-Asburg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score <8-10) and mean differences (MDs) in HAM-D scores after several ECT sessions were compared using inverse variance methods. The risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using the Cochrane RoB tool. DATA SYNTHESIS: Seventeen RCTs (RoB: Low N = 12, Moderate N = 2, High N = 3) with 1181 total patients met inclusion criteria. Patients receiving ECT experienced greater clinical remission (OR: 1.78, [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-2.93], I2 = 11%, N = 9) and lower HAM-D scores after the third through sixth ECT sessions as well as the eighth ECT session when ketamine versus nonketamine anesthesia was used. Ketamine use with ECT significantly increased fear with hallucinations (OR: 1.99, [95% CI: 1.11-3.58], I2 = 0%, N = 7) than with nonketamine anesthesia. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: Selecting ketamine-based anesthesia could more quickly and profoundly enhance the beneficial effects of ECT for patients with severe TRD, but the balance of benefits to harm is unclear as there may be additional adverse events. CONCLUSION: Ketamine is a promising anesthesia adjunct to ECT that may enhance antidepressant effects in exchange for more adverse events.",

We evaluated the effects of low-dose ketamine infusion in the intensive care unit (ICU) on fentanyl consumption and traumatic memories after hospital discharge. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was conducted at a university-based surgical ICU. 118 adult patients who were admitted to the ICU after noncardiac, nonneuro, nontrauma surgery between March 2019 and May 2021 were randomized to receive ketamine 1.5 µg/kg/min (n = 60) or placebo (n = 58). Fentanyl was given to achieve pain control (10-point numerical rating scale pain score [NRS] < 4) and sedation control (Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale [RASS] level between -2 and 0). A secondary study was conducted by a telephone interview after ICU discharge using the Thai version of the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) questionnaire to evaluate signs and symptoms of PTSD and traumatic memories to the time spent in the ICU. RESULTS: 24-hour fentanyl consumption was lower in patients who received ketamine compared with placebo (399 µg [95% confidence interval {CI}, 345-454] vs 468 µg [95% CI, 412-523], difference -68 µg; 95% CI, -67 to -69; P = .041); RASS and NRS scores did not differ between the 2 groups. Exploratory effect modification analysis suggested that the opioid-sparing effect of ketamine may be more relevant in patients with intraabdominal surgery (P-for-interaction = 0.012, difference, -177 µg; 95% CI, -204 to -149 µg; P = .001). No acute adverse effects of ketamine were observed. The secondary study included the information from 91 patients from the primary study. Long-term follow-up data was available for 45 patients (23 in the control group, 22 in the ketamine group), and the evaluations were taken 43 ± 8 months after ICU discharge. In this secondary study, ketamine use was associated with a higher incidence of frightening and delusional memories of critical illness and ICU treatment (65% vs 41%, P = .035). CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose ketamine is associated with a small but statistically significant reduction (15%) of postoperative opioid consumption in the ICU. Our secondary study revealed that patients who received low-dose ketamine during fentanyl-based postoperative pain therapy in the ICU recalled more frightening and delusional memories after ICU discharge."

      "abstract": "Ketamine's use in treating bipolar depression must account for risks, such as switching to manic episodes or worsening symptoms. This study examines ketamine's impact on depressive symptoms, focusing on 'inner tension,' 'sleep reduction,' and 'suicidal ideation' over four weeks in treatment-resistant bipolar disorder (TR-BD) patients. Fifty-nine patients with TR-BD were treated consecutively with ketamine (avg dose 0.8 mg/kg). Results showed significant reductions in MADRS scores without manic switches. Ketamine was well-tolerated despite polypharmacy. Antidepressant treatment of bipolar depression requires great caution because of the risk of switching to manic-mixed episodes and worsening of symptoms such as internal tension, psychomotor agitation, and suicide risk. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency and tolerability of intravenous ketamine in patients with bipolar I or bipolar II disorder and a current treatment-resistant depressive episode (TR-BD), with the aim of examining: 1) the risk of manic switches; 2) the effect on global depressive symptoms as measured by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS); and 3) the specific effects on the MADRS items of internal tension, sleep disturbance, and suicidal ideation over a four-week period. Fiftynine patients with TR-BD (51.4 ± 12.3 years; 30 % female) treated consecutively with intravenous ketamine (mean dose 0.8 mg/kg) were included in this study. No ketamine-treated patient experienced a manic switch during the observation period. A statistically significant decrease (i.e., improvement) in MADRS global score and scores on the Internal Tension, Reduced Sleep, and Suicidal Ideation items was observed from the second week, with no evidence of worsening of the above symptoms. Patient-reported adverse events were generally mild to moderate.",
