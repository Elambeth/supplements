      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial regulators of gene expression, impacting a wide range of biological processes. Their dysregulation can result in pathological changes and contribute to the development of various disorders. This study aims to evaluate the expression of selected miRNAs in duodenal tissue of paediatric patients with active celiac disease (CD), investigate the role of dysregulated miRNAs in disease pathogenesis and assess the changes in their expression profile in response to a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS AND RESULTS: The study included newly diagnosed celiac patients (n = 20), celiac patients adhering to a GFD (n = 17) and a control group (n = 29). The miRNA expression in duodenal samples was quantified by real-time PCR. Dysregulated miRNAs were analysed for functional enrichment in molecular pathways. Our results identified 8 dysregulated miRNAs in celiac patients: miR-155-5p (upregulated) and hsa-miR-22-5p, hsa-miR-192-5p, hsa-miR-338-3p, hsa-miR-31-5p, hsa-miR-31-3p, hsa-miR-215-5p and hsa-miR-378d (downregulated). Pathway analysis implicated these miRNAs in regulating various signaling pathways related to inflammation, immune response and intercellular junctions, all of which are relevant to the pathogenesis of CD. Moreover, miR-31-3p was upregulated in CD patients on a GFD, exhibiting a negative correlation with the duration of GFD. For other miRNAs, the level of expression in CD patients adhering to a GFD was restored to levels similar to those observed in the control group. CONCLUSION: This preliminary study reveals significant changes in miRNA expression in duodenal biopsies from paediatric CD patients and how these patterns shift with dietary intervention. Understanding the interactions among dysregulated miRNAs may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for managing CD.",

The only medical treatment for CD is a strict gluten-free diet (GFD), which is behaviorally dependent. Despite quality of life (QOL) and adherence being impacted by the complicated and burdensome nature of the GFD, there exists a paucity of established behavioral interventions aimed to improve adherence and QOL in adolescents with CD.AimsDevelop and refine the Gluten-Free Resilience and Overall Wellness (GROW) Project, the first family-centered, online behavioral intervention to improve QOL and GFD self-management in adolescents with CD and their parents.MethodsStudy staff adapted and refined an existing online behavioral intervention for adults with CD. Two rounds of interviews with patient, parent, and clinician stakeholders were conducted to collect feedback and inform the final intervention structure and content. Qualitative interview data were analyzed using inductive content analysis.ResultsStakeholder feedback supported a group-based, virtual format across both rounds of interviews. Participants proposed format changes to the intervention to increase participant engagement. Content suggestions included enhancing information about reliable digital resources, building resilience, GFD and alcohol, and the scientific development of the program.ConclusionThe GROW Project addresses a critical need for interventions that strengthen behavioral self-management strategies in adolescents with CD and their families by providing virtual skill-building and psychoeducation that may improve family's QOL while managing CD and the GFD."

      "abstract": "Background: Gluten-related disorders, particularly celiac disease, are triggered in susceptible individuals by the toxic effects of gluten, the major storage protein of wheat grains. This toxicity can be reduced by wheat glutenases. Members of the papain-like cysteine protease family, which can act in the human gastrointestinal tract, are promising candidates for the enzymatic treatment of celiac disease. Methods: Two wheat proteases were selected using AlphaFold2, produced in recombinant forms, and characterized. Their glutenase potentials under acidic or slightly acidic conditions were evaluated and compared with the properties of the previously characterized wheat glutenase Triticain-α. Results: All enzymes tested, Ta-P7, Ta-V6, and Triticain-α, were able to hydrolyze the model substrate (α-gliadin-derived epitope) in the pH range of 3.6-7.5. Nevertheless, Triticain-α performs the most efficient hydrolysis of the peptide substrate under the conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, according to its kinetic characteristics. In the wheat gluten degradation experiment at pH 4.6 and 37 °C, both Ta-P7 and Triticain-α cleaved the mixture almost completely within 5 min. In addition, Triticain-α and Ta-P7 significantly reduced the levels of toxic peptides compared to both intact gluten and gluten treated with pepsin-trypsin digestion as tested by the Ridascreen Gliadin Kit. Conclusions: Novel wheat proteases under investigation possess the expected glutenase activity to varying degrees; however, Triticain-α is a primary candidate for potential use in the enzymatic therapy of gluten-related disorders."

      "abstract": "Lipids have been used to regulate dough's processing characteristics; however, how they affect gluten properties remains unclear. In this study, the effects of different acid-based glycerolipids and thermomechanical treatments on gluten functionalities were investigated. The results demonstrated that exogenous oleic acid-based lipids regulate gluten secondary structure. Oleic acid increased the α-helix content and improved the viscoelasticity of gluten, whereas triolein and rapeseed oil reduced the viscoelasticity and enhanced its tensile properties. Thermomechanical treatment promoted the aggregation and formation of more disulfide bonds in gluten, whereas clear fluorescence quenching was observed in gluten-containing exogenous lipids. Moreover, molecular simulation analysis indicated that hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions are key non-covalent forces that promoted the interaction of exogenous lipids and gluten. Compared with other oleic acid-based glycerolipids, monoolein-gliadin systems exhibited the highest binding energies (-20.6 kJ/mol). Our results deepen the understanding of why oils and fats regulate the processing characteristics of wheat-based foods."

      "abstract": "This study developed an innovative approach for wheat starch-gluten separation (i.e. ultrasound-assisted xylanase treatment, U-Xyl), aiming at enhancing separation efficiency and improving products' quality. Image analysis revealed that U-Xyl facilitated release of starch granules from gluten network as a result of arabinoxylan degradation. Higher amount of xylanase addition induced greater polymerization of gluten and better viscoelasticity. Also, it promoted the formation of β-sheet and α-helix. When the xylanase amount increased to 0.15 % (U-Xyl15), starch and gluten yields reached their summit (53.66 % and 10.85 %, respectively). Up to 2.44 mg/g water-extractable arabinoxylan (WEAX) remained on isolated starch after U-Xyl15. This alleviated damage to the crystalline structure, amylose leaching, swelling power loss, and peak viscosity decrease. Owing to WEAX-starch interactions, U-Xyl15 enhanced the anti-retrogradation capacity of starch. Moreover, U-Xyl15 resulted in the highest gel strength (195.34 g). This paper could provide theoretical basis for industrial production of starch with desirable quality."

      "abstract": "Ultrasound (US) treatment is an eco-friendly physical modification technique increasingly used to enhance the functionality of gluten-free flours. In this study, the impact of sonication on the techno-functional, thermal, structural, and rheological properties of a composite gluten-free flour was investigated. The flour, comprising corn starch, rice flour, and other ingredients, was treated at hydration levels of 15% and 25% (w/w) under controlled conditions (10 min of sonication at 20 °C) and compared to a non-sonicated control. Sonication reduced the water absorption capacity (WAC) and swelling power (SP) while increasing the oil absorption capacity (OAC) and water solubility (WSI). Thermal analysis revealed lower gelatinization enthalpy, indicating structural modifications induced by cavitation. Structural assessments (XRD and FTIR) confirmed minimal alterations in crystallinity and short-range order. Rheological studies demonstrated an enhanced elasticity in the gel structure, especially at 15% hydration, while a morphological analysis via SEM highlighted particle fragmentation and surface roughening. These findings demonstrate the potential of ultrasound to modify gluten-free flours for improved functionality and diverse applications in gluten-free product development."

      "abstract": "To promote greater gluten matrix development and improve whole wheat bread quality, a novel wheat arabino-xylanase (PcXyn11A) from Podospora comata was extracellularly expressed in Pichia pastoris. The enzymatic activity of the recombinant PcXyn11A reached 727 U/mL at 4.4 mg/mL concentration, following high cell-density fermentation in a 5-L fermenter. The optimal pH and temperature of the purified PcXyn11A were pH 7.5 and 55 °C, respectively. PcXyn11A exhibited a specific activity of 409 U/mg towards wheat arabinoxylan (non-starch polysaccharide). Structural analysis revealed that the Arg155 and Tyr156 residues of PcXyn11A could recognize the arabinose side chain of FAX3, while its Asn157 residue could recognize the ferulic acid side of FAX3 through hydrogen bonds. Moreover, enzymatic modification of whole wheat (WW) dough and bread by PcXyn11A were investigated. PcXyn11A treatment reduced the peak viscosity, final viscosity, and retrogradation value of the WW dough by 3.1 %, 2.2 %, and 2.4 % respectively. Additionally, PcXyn11A treatment decreased the C2, C5, and C5-C4 values of the WW dough by 8.9 %, 5.6 %, and 11.1 %, respectively. These results indicating that PcXyn11A could efficiently degrade wheat arabinoxylan to release water, improve gluten matrix structure, retard retrogradation, increase gas retention, and delay the aging of WW dough. Treatment with 4 mg/kg of PcXyn11A increased the bread volume by 11.45 % and decreased its hardness by 34.68 %, compared to the control. Moreover, the PcXyn11A-treated bread exhibited good anti-aging properties when stored at 4 °C for 1-5 d, with a reduction in hardness by 25.9-35.4 %. This study identified a novel wheat arabino-xylanase (PcXyn11A) that demonstrates excellent non-starch polysaccharide modification to retard retrogradation and improve WW bread quality, laying a solid foundation for its application in flour-based industries."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease affecting 1.4% of the population worldwide. The only treatment for this condition is a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). Although the complexity of this condition is recognised, the definitive follow-up strategy and long-term management have still not been developed in the United Kingdom (UK) and Australia. This meta-synthesis aimed to explore the experiences of patients living with CD who follow the GFD in the UK and Australia. METHODS: A systematic search for primary qualitative literature related to experiences of patients with CD on a GFD and a meta-synthesis of the results were conducted. Healthcare-relevant online databases were screened: Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and Scopus, followed by reference list searching. A defined inclusion criteria were used to identify relevant studies. The data synthesis from the literature followed the thematic synthesis approach. A clear description of the methodology and peer review were applied to ensure transparency. RESULTS: A total of 286 studies were screened for eligibility. Of those, six studies met the inclusion criteria. The experiences of 198 patients living with CD were analysed and reported. Five analytical themes emerged through the thematic synthesis process: acceptance and adaptation, dietary burden, cost burden, socialising, and importance of support. All themes were found to impact patients' quality of life (QoL). The overall quality of the reviewed studies was described as good. CONCLUSION: This meta-synthesis revealed insights into the daily experiences of patients with CD in adhering to a GFD in the UK and Australia, being the first secondary qualitative study to explore this phenomenon. It highlighted the need for the development of defined strategies for patient follow-up to provide holistic care, considering the complexities of this condition and its impact on both physical and psychological domains.",

      "abstract": "The incorporation of pulse flour into gluten-free extruded snacks based on cereals improves the functional properties as well as the nutritional value of these types of products. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes induced by the extrusion process on the functional properties in terms of the concentration of total phenolic compounds (TPC), phenolic families (hydroxybenzoic acids, hydroxycinnamic acids, and flavonols), and non-nutritional factors (inositol phosphates and trypsin inhibitors) of extruded snack-type products developed from novel formulations based on rice-chickpea flours and fortified with different percentages of Fibersol® and passion-fruit-skin flour. The in vitro antioxidant activity of the studied formulations was evaluated to explore their potential for developing sustainable snack-type products with added functional value. The results demonstrated that extrusion treatment caused a statistically significant (p < 0.05) decrease (12-30%) in TPC. Despite this reduction, the extruded formulations preserve an interesting content of these compounds, with hydroxybenzoic acids being the majority in the analyzed formulations. The extrusion process maintained or decreased the content of phytate and total inositol phosphates in samples fortified with passion fruit and Fibersol®. A significant reduction (p < 0.05) of trypsin inhibitor activity (between 86.7% and 95.8%) was observed when comparing extruded samples to their raw counterpart. The antioxidant activity in vitro of the formulations was assessed. The results obtained by the Folin-Ciocalteu method indicated that extrusion caused a decrease in the antioxidant activity of 50% of the analyzed samples, while in the others, no changes were observed. DPPH and FRAP assays tended to demonstrate an increase in antioxidant activity. In general, the highest values were obtained by applying the DPPH method. Additionally, the effects of the ingredients used for fortifying the formulations were investigated. The results highlighted the complexity of the analyzed formulations, revealing that their composition is influenced not only by the presence of Fibersol® and passion fruit but also by the interaction between these two ingredients.",

There are no current FDA approved treatments for negative symptoms, which is a critical gap in our treatment of people with SRDs, since they are a major determinant of functional impairment.

Recently an SRD subgroup with high inflammation and elevated levels of anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA) of immunoglobulin G type (IgG) has been characterized. Negative symptom improvement has been previously observed with gluten removal in this subgroup in two small clinical trials. METHODS: We conducted a 5-week confirmatory double-blind placebo-controlled trial of a gluten free diet (GFD) versus gluten-containing diet (GCD) for negative symptoms in people with SRD who have elevated AGA IgG (NCT03183609). Participants were between the ages of 18-64 years, had baseline negative symptoms and a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Those included were screened for an AGA IgG >20 U, no serologic evidence of celiac disease, and stable antipsychotic treatment and dose. All participants were inpatients, received a GFD and were randomized to 30 grams of gluten or rice flour daily delivered in protein shakes. The Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS) Motivation and Pleasure (MAP) scale was the primary outcome measure. We also examined the CAINS Expressivity (EXP) scale, the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) and conducted regular side effect screening and laboratory measures for safety. FINDINGS: Between 2018 and 2024, we included 39 participants (N=21 GFD and N=18 GCD). There was a significant improvement over time in the CAINS MAP (treatment X time df=30.1, F=2.78, p=0.045) in the GFD compared to GCD, but no significant change in the CAINS EXP, the SANS, BPRS or MCCB. The diet was well tolerated; the most frequently occurring side effects were constipation (38.1% GFD, 33.3% GCD), sedation (33.3% GFD, 50% GCD), dry mouth (33.3% GFD, 33.3% GCD), headache (33.3% GFD, 27.8% GCD), and insomnia (33.3% GFD, 27.8% GCD). INTERPRETATION: This is the first large scale double-blind randomized clinical trial in SRD with AGA IgG+. This replication of smaller studies suggests that negative symptoms, particularly anhedonia and avolition may be improved. However, we did not replicate our previous finding of cognitive improvement and COVID-19 likely impacted the extent of improvement in negative symptoms due to quarantines and lockdowns. More work is needed to determine the mechanism of action of gluten removal in this subgroup with hopes of developing new treatment targets for motivational deficits of this illness. FUNDING: This project was funded by NIMH R01 R01MH113617 (DL Kelly PI)."

      "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of catalase (CAT) on the rheological properties of wheat gluten by analyzing CAT-induced structural changes in gluten proteins to uncover the mechanisms behind these modifications. The results showed that CAT significantly enhanced the storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G″) of gluten while reducing creep strain and recovery strain. The most pronounced effects were observed with the addition of 250 U/g CAT for 30 min. CAT facilitated the formation of larger molecular weight aggregates in gluten proteins and increased the content of disulfide bonds and β-sheets, reaching 11.42 μmol/g and 45.78 %, respectively, after treatment with 250 U/g CAT for 30 min. These structural changes reduced the hydrophobic regions of gluten, lowered gluten extractability, and enhanced the compactness and stability of the gluten network. These effects substantially influenced the rheological behavior of wheat gluten, offering new insights and practical guidance for improving gluten-based products using CAT.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The main treatment for Celiac Disease (CD) is the gluten-free diet (GFD). However, in some CD patients, iron deficiency anemia can be persistent despite a GFD. AIM: In this study, we aim to evaluate the prevalence of anemia in both adults and children with CD at the diagnosis and during the GFD. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study including both adults and children with CD, the demographic characteristics and hemoglobin, iron, folate and vitamin B12 levels were retrospectively retrieved from patients' medical records at the time of diagnosis (T0); after 3-5 years (T1) and after 8-10 years (T2) of GFD. RESULTS: 311 CD patients (184 adults and 127 pediatric patients) were included in the study. No difference was observed in the prevalence of anemia in the overall population after 3-5 years of GFD in both adult and pediatric patients compared to the diagnosis. At 8-10 years, in the adult patient's group, a significant reduction in the prevalence of anemia was observed (24% vs. 17.8% p = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the GFD and a very long observational period the diagnosis of anemia persists in 17.8% and 4.4% of adult and pediatric patients, respectively. The diagnostic delay (longer in adult patients) and a more pronounced ultrastructural mucosal injury could play a role in the persistence of anemia despite the GFD.",

      "abstract": "Methionine restriction has received some attention in recent years as a novel mode of dietary intervention. Our previous study found that methionine restriction could inhibit the celiac toxic effects of wheat gluten in an in vitro model. However, the role of methionine restriction in gluten-induced celiac intestinal damage remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore whether dietary methionine restriction could suppress the celiac toxic effects of gluten in an in vivo model, thereby mitigating intestine damage. This study systematically investigated the effects of dietary methionine restriction on celiac characteristic indicators such as symptoms, small intestine damage, and intestinal TG2 and IL-15 expression in a gluten-induced C57BL/6 mouse model. The availability of dietary methionine restriction in different ages (adolescent and adult) was also evaluated. Moreover, mouse cecum contents were assayed and co-analyzed for the metagenome of intestinal flora and target short-chain fatty acid metabolomics, with the goal of further exploring and elucidating critical pathways by which dietary methionine restriction plays a role. We discovered that dietary methionine restriction could effectively ameliorate the gluten-induced celiac-associated small intestine damage by modulating intestinal flora to inhibit butyric acid production. Specifically, dietary methionine restriction could inhibit butyric acid production with the help of s_CAG-485 sp002493045 and s_CAG-475 sp910577815, which in turn affected the mitochondrial function within the intestinal epithelial cells to assist in the repair of intestine damage. This study might provide new insights into modulating dietary patterns to mitigate intestinal damage in celiac disease and the production of novel gluten-free products.",

This review aims to provide the most recent insights in pathophysiological mechanisms and to summarize the evidence for a gluten- or wheat-free diet in IBS and NCGWS. RECENT FINDINGS: The exact role of gluten and wheat in IBS and NCGWS pathophysiological mechanisms remains complex. However, recent findings suggest a role for antigliadin antibodies to identify those IBS patients who may benefit from a gluten-free diet and low levels of fecal calprotectin to differentiate IBS and NCGWS. The importance of gut-brain interactions in self-reported gluten sensitive individuals was shown by a strong nocebo effect, although a role of gluten could not be excluded. Evidence for a gluten-free diet remains debatable in both conditions, whereas a wheat-free diet may have more potential, especially in NCGWS. SUMMARY: IBS and NCGWS are two closely related conditions with a complex and largely unrevealed pathophysiology. The role of gluten may have been overestimated in the past, but it is likely that certain wheat components, along with gut-brain interactions, play a role in both conditions.",

      "abstract": "Transamidation of gliadin under reducing conditions has shown promise in mitigating celiac disease-related gluten toxicity. However, comprehensive evaluation in both in vitro and in vivo models is crucial. This study investigated the effects of transamidated gliadin (GM) on celiac toxicity using Caco-2 cell monolayers, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), and a BALB/c mouse model. In cellular level, GM mitigated intestinal damage compared to unmodified gliadin and stimulated a less pronounced pro-inflammatory response, suggesting a reduced activation of the T-cell-mediated immune system. In vivo, the GM group displayed lower levels of pro-inflammatory factors and less pronounced Th1/Th2 imbalance compared to the unmodified gliadin group. Notably, the GM also improved the balance of the intestinal microbiome. In brief, GM exhibited significantly reduced celiac toxicity in both cellular and animal models that mimics the intestinal environment of celiac disease. These findings suggest that transamidation treatment holds potential as a safer alternative strategy to lower the toxicity of wheat gliadin/wheat flour, potentially paving the way for developing modified gluten-based foods with desirable texture or ingredients as a nutritional enhancer or structure improver, benefiting individuals with specific needs.",

When the ultrasonic power is 300 W, the protein polymerization can be promoted, thus improving the gluten network. The mechanical action and cavitation induced by ultrasound changed the water distribution of FXL dough and promoted the transition from weakly bound water to tightly bound water. The T21 value (tightly bound water relaxation time) was shortened from 0.25 to 0.16 and the A21 (tightly bound water content) was reduced from 6.35 to 5.18, an improvement of 22.6 %, at a power of 300 W. Ultrasound decreased the enthalpy of FXL dough, and increased the particle size and potential of gluten protein. The introduction of ultrasound increased the content of β-sheets structure (40.85) at 250 W. The microstructure of the FXL dough revealed that ultrasonic treatment induced a continuous tight membrane-like gluten network, while the application of 500 W ultrasonic power resulted in the exposure and depression of starch particles.",

This observational prospective study explores the in vitro osteoclastogenic potential of peripheral blood precursors originating from adult active (newly diagnosed and untreated) celiac disease patients (aCeD) and describes the longitudinal changes in osteoclastogenesis after long-term adherence to GFD. To find connections between in vitro observations and in vivo bone metabolism changes, serum levels of 25(OH)D3, PTH, bCTX, PINP, CRP, IL-6, RANKL and OPG were measured before and after GFD and levels of these markers were correlated with the rate of osteoclastogenesis in vitro. OPG and IL-6 showed associations with BMD and/or presence of OPN/OP. Patients after GFD (CeD-GFD) exhibited improved BMD and increased serum 25(OH)D3 levels, alongside reduced bCTX and PINP levels. Compared to healthy donors, aCeD osteoclast genesis in vitro was higher and, surprisingly, remained elevated even in CeD-GFD patients. Negative correlation was found between osteoclastogenesis rate and serum OPG in aCeD, while osteoclastogenesis rate positively correlated with PTH in CeD-GFD. These results highlight OPG as marker for risk of OPN/OP in CeD and suggest that improvement of BMD after GFD is a result of uncoupling between bone metabolism and osteoresorptive action of osteoclasts after GFD.",

This work presents the development of an electrochemical immunoplatform exhibiting many practical advantages including simplicity, reduced cost and high sensitivity for the screening of gluten-containing products. The methodology exploited the unique features offered by a recombinant antibody fragment with high affinity towards gliadin together with the use of magnetic microcarriers (MμCs) as scaffolds for the implementation of an indirect competitive immunoassay. Using amperometric transduction on disposable electrodes and the horseradish peroxidase/hydrogen peroxide/hydroquinone system, a dynamic range between 7.3 and 1982 ng mL-1 was obtained for gliadin standards, with a limit of detection of 1.4 ng mL-1. The developed immunoplatform was successfully employed for the analysis of a variety of processed foodstuffs, demonstrating the ability to discriminate between gluten-free and gluten-containing foods according to the legislated threshold (20 mg kg-1 of gluten). The agreement with the results provided by the R5-based ELISA and qPCR methods confirmed the suitability of the bioplatform as a competitive tool in terms of assay time (results in just 60 min after gliadin extraction) sensitivity and applicability, even at the point of need.",

      "abstract": "The determination of biomarkers is a significant field of analytical chemistry research under continuous evolution that contributes to enhance diagnostics and enable more personalized medicine. Celiac disease is a systemic autoimmune disorder caused by the ingestion of gluten (Glu) proteins found in various cereals. Currently, the only effective way to prevent and manage potential complications is through a strict gluten-free diet (GFD). However, both intentional and unintentional dietary transgressions can occur, often leading to persistent symptoms and ineffective treatment. In this scenario, the development of analytical strategies to detect biomarkers of gluten intake and monitor adherence to a GFD is of significant interest. Herein, we present an analytical strategy based on high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) combined with colorimetric detection to estimate 3,5-dihydroxycinnamic acid (3,5-DHCA) as selective biomarker of Glu intake in urine. The approach combined Fast Blue (FB)-doped polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane with colorimetric HPTLC (RP-C18) giving rise to a selective method to isolate 3,5-DHCA response in urine samples. Detection by visual inspection, image analysis, and spectroscopic response was evaluated and compared. Analytical parameters were estimated showing a good sensitivity (limit of detection (LOD) ≤ 0.8 mg L-1) and precision, relative standard deviation (RSD) values < 7%. Analysis of urine samples of celiac patients and control patients was performed, and recovery studies showed satisfactory values (R > 80%). The preliminary results indicated correlation between Glu intake and positive 3,5-DHCA responses. This study demonstrated that FB-doped PDMS membranes-HPTLC is a promising tool for detecting dietary transgressions to the GFD by visual inspection, and subsequent quantitative analysis by image analysis and spectroscopic techniques. Hence, the proposed analytical method contributes to the advance of knowledge about celiac disease, which still remains an important challenge to our society.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dietary peptides are increasingly linked to inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases, exemplified by coeliac disease. Coeliac disease is caused by an acquired immune response to proline- and glutamine-rich gluten peptides, which bottleneck proteolysis and provide substrates for immune recognition. Enzyme therapies aim to eliminate gluten immunogenic peptides as an adjunct to gluten-free diet. AIMS: To investigate overlooked aspects of enzyme development given difficulties in translating preclinical efficacy into clinical benefit. METHODS: We assessed mode-of-action, target organ and drug delivery in the context of digestive physiology and motility for gluten-digesting enzymes on the market or in development until 1 December 2024. RESULTS: Most enzymes were gastric endopeptidases specific for proline or glutamine residues. Gastric enzymes may achieve poor enzyme-substrate exposure due to limited mixing and rapid emptying of water-soluble particles. Moreover, endopeptidases cleave proteins/peptides into shorter peptides but do not systematically cleave protein into absorbable fractions. Natural digestive physiology provides thorough mixing at the intestinal brush border, which produces exopeptidases necessary to fully digest proline-rich peptides. Despite reduced activity in patients with coeliac disease, exopeptidases remain underexplored as therapeutic agents. Given limited substrate scope and end-to-end digestion, exopeptidases are ineffective as single agents, requiring functional combinations. Furthermore, vulnerability to gastric acid requires stabilisation or formulation for rapid enteric release. CONCLUSIONS: Enzymes should be stabilised throughout the gastrointestinal tract including the small intestine. Exopeptidases perform a critical function by systematically generating absorbable fractions, warranting future investigation as therapeutic agents. Sensitive and translational biomarkers are needed to better assess enzyme efficacy in real-meal conditions.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the potential effects of corn protein activity peptides (CPAPs) on inflammation response levels and gastrointestinal microbiota in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection mice. CPAPs significantly up-regulated the mRNA expression of the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 and down-regulated the mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory factors TGF-β, TLR4, MyD88, and NF-κB, indicating that CPAPs may antagonize H. pylori-induced inflammatory responses by inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathways. Through the intervention of CPAPs, H. pylori colonization in the stomach was significantly reduced. Additionally, the structural composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota improved, with an increase in abundance and diversity. These changes positively regulate gastrointestinal microbiota disorders in mice. In addition, the PICRUST function prediction of intestinal microbiota revealed that CPAPs may prevent or reduce metabolic disorders brought about by H. pylori, which improve biometabolic pathways by modulating intestinal microbiota composition. In conclusion, these findings suggest that CPAPs may prevent or mitigate metabolic disorders induced by H. pylori, offering theoretical support for the development of corn-protein-based functional foods.",

It presents with a spectrum of symptoms, including both gastrointestinal and extraintestinal manifestations, as well as neurological symptoms. A review of the literature indicates that 10-22% of patients with CeD present with neurological symptoms. The objective of this study is to assess the influence of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on brain bioelectrical activity and neurological symptoms in children with CeD. Methods: The study was conducted using a multidisciplinary approach, encompassing a comprehensive array of clinical data gathered alongside laboratory test results, questionnaires, and electroencephalogram (EEG) assessments. The study population included 85 children: 18 newly diagnosed cases of CeD patients (NDC), subsequently reassessed after 6 months on a GFD as a celiac disease on diet (CDD); 27 CeD patients on a GFD for over 12 months (CDD2); and 40 healthy individuals in the comparison group (CG). Results: It was observed that over half of the NDC group exhibited neurological symptoms, particularly headaches. Following a six-month period on a GFD, there was a notable reduction in symptom severity. In comparison to the CG, the NDC patient group exhibited a higher prevalence of abnormalities in EEG recordings (p = 0.032), including focal sharp waves or slow waves. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that a GFD has a positive impact on the neurological condition of children with CeD. The clinical improvements correspond with EEG normalization, which supports the hypothesis that dietary intervention plays a role in mitigating CeD-associated neurological dysfunction."

In situ generating injectable hydrogels, characterized by minimally invasive methods, encapsulating stability, and pH-responsive breakdown have emerged as viable delivery systems. Herein, we aim to explore a particular therapeutic modality involving the use of celecoxib-loaded GABA/wheat gluten‑sodium alginate (SA/WG-GABA+COX(40)) nanocarriers in enhancing apoptosis of OSCC (HSC-3 & SCC-25). Eventually, drug release profiles show that loaded COX and GABA demonstrated 96.04% and 98.1% at 7.2 pH. Interestingly, crucial experimental techniques like MTT assay, AO/EB staining, DAPI labeling for SCC-25, and HSC-3 displayed the highest cell lysis percentages of 86.5% and 93.3%. Notably, OSCC cell proliferation and migration and cell multiplications were limited with formulated WG/SA-GABA+COX(40) which was evident from In vitro ROS assay, flow cytometry, and JC-1 analysis. In vivo histology, blood serum biochemistry, and tumor examination in xenograft nude mice demonstrated that SA/WG-GABA+COX(40) mice reduced HSC-3 tumor cell proliferation. Downregulation of glutathione and activation of CCND2 signaling pathway caused HSC-3 OSCC cell death. Henceforth, present findings offer an advanced drug delivery method for targeted chemotherapy in treating OSCC.",

There is evidence suggesting that total plasma alkylresorcinol concentration may also be used as a biomarker for gluten intake in adults. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate if total alkylresorcinol concentration is a valid biomarker for gluten intake in young children. METHODS: Nonfasting plasma alkylresorcinol concentrations were analyzed by normal-phase ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in 65 children aged 18 mo included in a randomized controlled trial. The intervention group was following a gluten-free diet (n = 21, 31.3%), whereas the diet was unrestricted in the control group (n = 44, 65.7%). Alkylresorcinol concentrations in the 65 children were validated against simultaneously collected 3-d food records estimating total gluten intake. RESULTS: Gluten intake in controls was median 5.8 grams/d (IQR: 2.8-9.4, max 17.1) compared with 0.0 g/d (IQR: 0.0-0.0, max 0.7, P < 0.001) in the intervention group. In the control group, wheat accounted for mean 85% (SD: 0.1) of the gluten intake. The intervention group had lower alkylresorcinol levels (median: 7.2 nmol/L; IQR: 4.0-10.5) compared with controls (median: 269; IQR: 116-505 nmol/L, P < 0.001). The correlation between alkylresorcinol concentrations and gluten intake was ρ = 0.68 (P < 0.001). Alkylresorcinol concentrations increased by 35.7% [95% confidence interval (CI): 25.9, 46.2, P < 0.001] for every g/d increase of gluten intake. The Cohen's weighted kappa between quartiles of alkylresorcinol and gluten intake was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.59, 0.86). CONCLUSIONS: Alkylresorcinol concentrations increased with gluten intake in young nonfasting children. The findings suggest that alkylresorcinol concentrations may be a useful biomarker for gluten intake in young children. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03562221.",

This study aimed to validate the Hellenic version of the Celiac Disease Adherence Test (H-CDAT) to evaluate adherence levels and explore the impact of dietary adherence on health-related quality of life (HRQoL)-both of which have never been objectively assessed in Greek CD patients. METHODS: The study included 102 adult CD patients who completed H-CDAT, diet-related questions, and the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). RESULTS: H-CDAT demonstrated good psychometric properties and showed multiple strong correlations with HRQoL dimensions. H-CDAT adherence was Good in 38.2%, Moderate in 42.2%, and Poor in 19.6% of patients, despite their perception of effective adherence, with 51% never having visited a dietitian for guidance on a GFD. Patients scored significantly lower across most HRQoL dimensions compared to the general Greek population. When stratified into the three adherence categories, striking differences emerged between Good and Moderate adherence across both physical and mental health domains, highlighting that moderate adherence is not sufficient for optimal health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings emphasize the critical role of strict GFD adherence in improving overall health and underscore the importance of dietetic intervention for achieving optimal patient outcomes.",

OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on HbA1c levels in patients with both type 1 diabetes and CD. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, biochemical and clinical information was gathered from 174 children with T1DM from January 2013 to January 2019. RESULTS: We assessed 174 children with T1DM (93 girls and 81 boys). Celiac disease was diagnosed in 18 out of 174 cases (10.34%). Height and weight percentiles showed significant differences between children with CD and those without CD (P = 0.015 and P = 0.026, respectively). The average HbA1c in the celiac group was 8.61 ± 2.20 (95% CI: 5.1 - 12.1) prior to GFD therapy. HbA1c was assessed six and twelve months following the initiation of the GFD and was found to be 8.32 ± 1.46 (95% CI: 6 - 9.8) and 8.37 ± 1.67 (95% CI: 6.1 - 10.2), respectively. No significant change in HbA1c was observed before and after therapy (P = 0.501). CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic children with CD exhibit lower weight and height compared to those without CD. Gluten-free diet therapy in patients with CD did not affect HbA1c levels."

      "abstract": "Coeliac disease is an immune-mediated chronic enteropathy, with a prevalence of around 1% in the general population and occurring in genetically susceptible individuals after the ingestion of gluten proteins present in wheat, rye and barley. Currently, a strict lifelong gluten-free diet is the cornerstone of treatment of coeliac disease. However, maintaining strict dietary adherence is challenging for many patients, due to the high costs, the highly restrictive nature of the diet and the impact on patients' quality of life. Moreover, a tiny minority of coeliac patients can develop pre-malignant/malignant complications of coeliac disease, a group of conditions, that despite being rare, are still burdened by a poor prognosis due to the lack of effective therapies. Therefore, the development of pharmacological treatments as an alternative to or supportive of a gluten-free diet is still an unmet need. The identification of new pathogenetic targets in the last years has enabled the development of several candidates molecules, many of which have been investigated in phase 2/3 clinical trials. In this narrative review we aim to summarise the investigational therapies that have been evaluated in phase 2/3 trials and provide a critical overview on the latest advances in this field."

      "abstract": "Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease and its management is palliative. There is no specific dietary protocol for SS patients. A gluten-free diet has been tested in SS patients with celiac disease (CD) and indicated modest improvements. Whether gluten-free diets per sè could alleviate autoimmune inflammatory processes in the salivary glands of SS patients with associated CD or even in SS patients without CD is an interesting hypothesis and warrants clinical studies. Hypokalemia in SS patients is among the most frequent sequelae of renal tubular acidosis. Supplementation with potassium (K)-rich diets can reduce inflammation and oxidative stress. K level in CD patients is highly abnormal at diagnosis and gluten-free diets help to normalize its serum level in CD patients. Furthermore, treatment of severe cases of SS requires concomitant glucocorticoid therapy and K supplementation. Results of two separate clinical trials in (i) patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) -a disease with similar pathology to SS- indicated that the enhanced serum cortisol followed K supplementation, and in (ii) celiac patients, serum K levels were normalized after the administration of a gluten-free diet. We reviewed the literature extensively on this topic to propose a hypothesis to address this problem and suggest a novel potential for K-rich, gluten-free diets in SS patients. Based on causal associations, we propose that higher K absorption and cortisol secretion following gluten-free diets accompanied by K-rich diets in SS patients with low serum potassium levels, may confer a higher therapeutic potential. Clinical trials are needed to test this hypothesis."

Conversely, EDs may mask and complicate CD symptoms, leading to diagnostic delays and treatment challenges.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to map the digestion of gluten-derived immunogenic peptides along the GIT using the growing pig as a human adult model and actinidin as a model exogenous protease. METHODS: Entire male pigs 9 wk of age [n = 54, 19.3 ± 1.9 (mean ± SD) kg bodyweight] were fed whole wheat soda bread either with yellow kiwifruit (0 U protease actinidin activity/mL fresh juice) or green kiwifruit (27.0 U protease actinidin activity/mL fresh juice) for 8 d. Pigs were killed at 0, 20, 60, 120, and 300 min postprandially. Entire gastrointestinal contents were collected to determine the hydrolysis of wheat proteins in the stomach and the presence of immunogenic peptides along the GIT. Polynomial regression analysis was conducted to determine the treatment, time, and their interaction effects. RESULTS: In the stomach, the mean rate of digestion of wheat proteins was 0.08 ± 0.006% per minute (mean ± standard error), whereas the mean rate of reduction of immunogenic peptides (R5 epitopes) was 3.4 ± 0.1 mg/min. This resulted in a mean rate of 3.2 ± 0.7 mg/min of the R5 epitopes entering the small intestine. At 300 min postprandial, R5 epitopes reached the large intestine. All these values were influenced when the protease actinidin was present in the meal. For instance, actinidin doubled (P < 0.05) the rate of digestion of wheat proteins in the stomach and subsequently reduced the rate of R5 epitopes entering the small intestine (0.6 ± 0.4 mg/min) and the amount released (P < 0.05) into the large intestine. CONCLUSIONS: Digestion of gluten immunogenic peptides is limited along the GIT, but it can be enhanced by a simultaneous intake of proteases.",

      "abstract": "To elucidate the effect of transglutaminase (TG) on the rheological properties of wheat gluten, this study investigates the underlying mechanisms by analyzing changes in gluten structure. The results demonstrated that the TG-treated gluten samples had higher storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G″) compared to the control, conversely, creep and recovery strains followed an opposite trend. Notably, the most pronounced effects were observed with adding 2 U/g TG for 20-30 min. Size exclusion/reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography profiles revealed that the treatment with TG elevated the levels of glutenin subunits, alongside reduced α- and γ-gliadins, promoting gluten aggregation. Moreover, the extractability of gluten gradually decreased due to TG-induced oxidation of sulfhydryl groups, which formed new disulfide bonds and cross-linked products. This structural modification reduced surface hydrophobic regions and promoted the aggregation of low molecular weight proteins into larger molecular weight aggregates. Microstructural analysis further confirmed that TG enhanced gluten network stability through covalent cross-linking. Overall, this study demonstrates that TG enhances the rheological characteristics of wheat gluten by facilitating the formation of a more robust network structure, driven by cross-linking reactions and disulfide bond formation.",

The results indicated that the addition of these amino acids during microwave treatment significantly increased the cakes' specific volume by 49 %. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that cake crystallinity reached 56.23 % and 49.17 % when lysine and arginine were used, respectively. Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy showed confirmed the absence of new functional groups or chemical bonds under different treatments, but the absorbance ratio at 1047 cm-1 to 1022 cm-1 was higher in microwave-treated cakes with lysine compared to traditionally steamed cakes. Simulated digestion experiments demonstrated that microwave-treated cakes, especially with added amino acids, exhibited higher protein digestibility but lower starch digestibility. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy observations further showed that proteins formed a denser network structure around starch granules during in vitro digestion, suggesting improved protein functionality and structure in microwave-treated quinoa sponge cakes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In coeliac disease, the clinical role of the urinary gluten immunogenic peptide is unclear. It has been suggested it can be a non-invasive marker of villous atrophy. Therefore, we present the largest cross-sectional clinical data in patients with coeliac disease to establish the diagnostic accuracy of the urinary gluten immunogenic peptide in identifying villous atrophy. METHODS: Patients providing urinary gluten immunogenic peptide were identified between September 2018 and August 2023 at the National Health Service (NHS) England National Centre for Non-Responsive and Refractory CD. In our retrospective study, the results of the urinary gluten immunogenic peptide test collected within 7 days, self-reported adherence to a gluten free diet reported within 3 months, serology collected within 7 days (immunoglobulin A - tissue transglutaminase and endomysial antibody) and histology at the time of endoscopy were compared in individuals with coeliac disease who were either asymptomatic and undergoing remission biopsies (group 1), non-responsive coeliac disease (group 2) and refractory coeliac disease on immunosuppressive therapy (group 3). Associations between dichotomous variables were calculated using chi-squared test. RESULTS: In group 1 the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for detecting villous atrophy were 42.9%, 83.3.%, 64.3% and 67.6% respectively. In group 2 the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for detecting villous atrophy were 36.2%, 79.0%, 39.5% and 76.6% respectively. In group 3 the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for detecting villous atrophy were 56.3%, 70.6%, 73.0% and 53.3%. More patients on immunosuppression had a positive urinary gluten immunogenic peptide than those not on immunosuppression (43.3% vs 24.1%, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The urinary gluten immunogenic peptide does not have a role in identifying villous atrophy. Therefore, to assess for villous atrophy an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is still required.",

Urine testing for gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) is a new method to detect gluten exposure within the last 3-12 h. Our aims were to compare gluten-free dietary adherence between T1D + CeD and CeD individuals and evaluate urinary GIP testing in an outpatient setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This observational cross-sectional study included three adult groups: (1) T1D and CeD, (2) CeD only, and (3) T1D only. T1D participants were recruited from outpatient clinics, the CeD group via social media. One urine sample (12 pm-7 pm) was analyzed using a qualitative immunographic GIP test. CeD participants completed 'Celiac Dietary Adherence Test' (CDAT) and 'Celiac Symptom Index' (CSI) questionnaires. IgA anti-transglutaminase 2 (IgA-TG2) and IgG anti-deamidated gliadin (IgG-DGP) serology were also analyzed. RESULTS: 197 participants, mean (SD) age 43 (15) years, were included. Female percentages were: CeD: 90%, T1D + CeD: 64%, and T1D: 47%. Positive urinary GIP was found in 15% (14/96) of T1D + CeD and 0% (0/50) of CeD (p = 0.002). As expected, most T1D only participants had positive urinary GIP (86%, 44/51). CDAT and CSI scores did not differ between T1D + CeD and CeD groups. Positive IgA-TG2 and/or IgG-DGP levels were found in 12% of T1D + CeD and 6% of CeD participants (p = 0.38). CONCLUSIONS: A single GIP urine test revealed higher gluten exposure in T1D + CeD versus CeD only, questioning dietary adherence in this population. Urinary GIP tests can be useful for clinical follow-up.",

In this study, the high-soluble modified wheat gluten (M-WG) as an emulsifier in ice cream was investigated. Compared to monoglycerides (MG) and soy protein isolates (SPI), the ice cream emulsion prepared with M-WG exhibited smaller droplet sizes and a more consistent dispersion. And the M-WG exhibited same emulsifying capabilities as MG and SPI from perspectives of viscosity, storage modulus, and loss modulus of ice cream products. Additionally, the overrun and meltdown rates of ice cream made with M-WG were better than MG and SPI. Furthermore, ice cream made with M-WG exhibited good sensory characteristics (color and hardness). It suggested that the high-soluble M-WG has an excellent potential to be applied in ice cream as an emulsifier, thereby broadening the novel natural alternatives of chemical emulsifiers derived from plant-based proteins.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, the gluten-free diet (GFD) has become much more than the dietary treatment for celiac disease. Due to its presumed beneficial effects even in non-celiac subjects, it has become a new fashion statement and it is promoted by some healthcare professionals, social media and marketing strategists. On the other hand, regardless of a proper medical indication, a GFD may present side effects, such as poor palatability, high costs and socio-psychological adversities. Moreover, it can be an obstacle to correct clinical practice and may induce nutritional deficiency due to a low-quality diet. In addition, a GFD can trigger or exacerbate many irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like disorders in predisposed subjects: reactivity to dietary nickel, the increased consumption of FODMAP-rich foods and histamine intolerance seem to frequently play a relevant role. The possible intersections between high-risk foods in these categories of patients, as well as the possible overlaps among IBS-like disorders during GFD, are described. In conclusion, it is advisable to undergo a careful clinical evaluation by a gastroenterologist and a nutritionist (in some cases, also a psychotherapist) before starting and during a GFD, because both benefits and risks are possible. It is also important to take into account IBS-like disorders that can be exacerbated by a GFD and that are still underestimated today.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Individuals with celiac disease (CD) often report the persistence of gastrointestinal symptoms despite adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). A diet rich in fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) could cause symptoms in CD on a GFD, and conversely a low-FODMAP diet could positively influence the therapeutic management of CD and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). The aim of this review was to explore the hypothetical impact of the FODMAD diet and the low-FODMAP diet (LFD) in CD and gluten-related disorders. METHODS: A complete online search for FODMAP related to CD, NCGS, and the GFD was carried out using the Pubmed, Medline, and Cochrane databases. RESULTS: Indeed, an LFD could successfully provide symptom relief in GFD-treated CD patients. Fructans, typical components of FODMAPs, have been associated with digestive symptoms in NCGS, and an LFD could improve the clinical picture. According to some evidence, an LFD could also improve the psychological status both in celiac patients on a GFD and in NCGS. However, an LFD should not have a significant impact on gut microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: Recent evidence supports the role of FODMAP restriction in CD patients with persistent symptoms on a GFD and in decreasing gastrointestinal disturbances in NCGS, although the GFD still represents the first-line therapy.",

      "abstract": "Umami peptides have the ability to enhance food flavours and have potential health benefits. The objective of this study was to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the umami intensity, taste mechanism, and antioxidant activity of six umami peptides derived from wheat gluten hydrolysates (WGHs) and fermented WGHs. The e-tongue analysis demonstrated that the peptides exhibited a direct proportionality in terms of umami value and concentration, and were capable of enhancing the umami of commercially available condiments. The molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the peptides interacted with T1R1/T1R3 receptors via hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, ionic interactions, and water bridges, thereby producing umami. Furthermore, the DPPH, ABTS, hydroxyl radical-scavenging, and FRAP assays demonstrated that the six peptides exhibited antioxidant activity in vitro. Ultimately, the network pharmacology and molecular docking results indicated that AKT1, JUN, and CASP3 may serve as the core targets for the peptides in the treatment of oxidative diseases. In conclusion, this work offers novel insights into the use of bioactive umami peptides, emphasising their prospective applications in the food and health supplement industries."

Not everyone is able to adapt to the new eating style and may develop maladaptive behaviors. The objective was to evaluate the factors of adherence to the gluten-free diet in people with celiac disease in Paraguay in 2023. METHODOLOGY: We perform an observational, cross-sectional design in adolescent and adult subjects with celiac disease. A telematic questionnaire containing demographic and clinical data was applied. The adherence to the diet was evaluated with the Leffler questionnaire, eating attitudes and behaviors with the CD-FAB instrument, and family support with the family APGAR test. Descriptive and analytical statistics were applied with SPSS Statistics 25™ software. The research respected ethical aspects. RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 292 people. The median age was 33 years and predominated the female sex (85.3%). Good adherence to the gluten-free diet was detected in 151 (51.7%) people and good adaptation to it in 164 (56.2%). In 141 cases (48.3%) it was stated that they had family support. The analysis showed that prolonged time since diagnosis and having family support were significantly associated with adherence to the gluten-free diet (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In people with celiac disease, adherence to the gluten-free diet was related to a prolonged time since diagnosis and receiving family support. It is recommended to investigate the causes of maladaptive behaviors to the gluten-free diet.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Currently, the main treatment for celiac disease (CD) is the gluten-free diet (GFD). This observational cohort study investigated the impact of CD and 1 year of GFD on gut function and microbiome. METHODS: A total of 36 newly diagnosed patients and 36 healthy volunteers (HVs) were studied at baseline and at 12-month follow-up. Small bowel water content (SBWC), whole gut transit time (WGTT), and colon volumes were measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Stool sample DNA was subjected to shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Species-level abundances and gene functions, including CAZymes (carbohydrate active enzymes) were determined. RESULTS: SBWC was significantly higher in people with CD (157 ± 15 mL) vs (HVs 100 ± 12 mL) (P = .003). WGTT was delayed in people with CD (68 ± 8 hours) vs HVs (41 ± 5 hours) (P = .002). The differences reduced after 12 months of GFD but not significantly. Well-being in the CD group significantly improved after GFD but did not recover to control values. CD fecal microbiota showed a high abundance of proteolytic gene functions, associated with Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, and Peptostreptococcus. GFD significantly reduced Bifidobacteria and increased Blautia wexlerae. Microbiome composition correlated positively with WGTT, colonic volume, and Akkermansia municphilia but negatively with B wexerelae. Following GFD, the reduction in WGTT and colonic volume was significantly associated with increased abundance of B wexlerae. There were also significant alterations in CAZyme profiles, specifically starch- and arabinoxylan-degrading families. CONCLUSIONS: CD impacted gut function and microbiota. GFD ameliorated but did not reverse these effects, significantly reducing Bifidobacteria associated with reduced intake of resistant starch and arabinoxylan from wheat.

      "abstract": "Gluten-related disorders (GRD) include celiac disease (CD), non celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) and wheat allergy (WA), conditions that are associated with the ingestion of gluten-containing food. Gut microbiota composition and function may be involved in the pathogenesis of GRD. In untreated CD the microbiota is characterized by a reduction in beneficial microbes like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium and an increase in pathogenic ones such as Bacteroides and E. coli. Dysbiosis is a hallmark of CD, persists across various disease stages and is only partially corrected by a gluten-free diet. NCGS patients show a different microbial profile, with a notable decrease in microbial richness, and an increase of Ruminococcaceae and decrease of Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria. The increase of certain bacterial groups such as Clostridium and Anaerobacter, in contrast with the decline of Bacteroides and Clostridium XVIII, marks a distinctive microbial signature associated with allergic responses to food. Mechanisms linking the gut microbiota to the development of GRD include effects on the gut barrier function, microbiota-mediated immune response to gluten, and an impact of microbial metabolites on gluten digestion and tolerance. Although the gluten-free diet is the primary therapy of GRDs, treatment with probiotics may contribute to improve the natural history of these disorders, for instance by minimizing the damaging effects of gluten contamination and accelerating the catch-up growth at the beginning of the dietary treatment of CD. Additional high-quality trials are still needed to identify and standardize the use of probiotics/prebiotics in GRDs.",

Mainstay of treatment in celiac disease is total avoidance of gluten in diet whereas treatment in child with both the diseases will be Insulin therapy, exercise along with gluten free diet (GFD). There is dearth of literature regarding adherence to GFD and barriers for children with both T1DM and CD. METHODS: A questionnaire-based study was done at a tertiary care institute so as to compare the self-reported gluten adherence and the problems faced by children with dual diseases (TIDM and CD) and CD alone. Thirty children of age group 5-14 years each withType 1 DM and CD (T1DMCD group) and celiac disease (CD group) were selected consecutively. A questionnairewas filled by asking questions from either children (above 8 years) or parents (below 8 years) and the results were compiled, compared and further analysed. RESULTS: Baseline demographic parameters were comparable in both the groups. Gluten adherence was found to be worse in T1DMCD group as compared to CD group. Greater number of problems were experienced by children with both TIDM and CD as compared to children with CD alone (P < 0.05). Financial burden more so in T1DMCD group, unawareness about disease and benefits of GFD, less availability and social isolation were found to be the most significant barriers to diet adherence. CONCLUSION: As these children face dual diseases, they should be made more aware regarding benefits of GFD. Such information is valuable to primary care physicians for better management and rehabilitation of children suffering from these chronic diseases."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Current professional guidelines enable diagnosing pediatric Celiac Disease (CeD) without a biopsy, when tissue transglutaminase (TTG) IgA antibodies are >  × 10 the upper limit of normal (ULN) and anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA) are positive in a second sample. We compared baseline characteristics and serology normalization in children diagnosed with or without biopsies. A retrospective study of pediatric patients diagnosed with CeD during 2020: group A, no biopsy and group B, biopsy-based diagnosis. Baseline characteristics included demographics, anthropometrics, symptoms, family history, and celiac serology. Follow-up at 6-month intervals, up to 18 months, included dietary compliance, symptoms, and serology. Of 145 children diagnosed with CeD, 42 (29%) and 103 (71%) were from group A and B respectively. Mean age was 7.8 years (range 2.4-17.9 y), 91 (62.8%) females. Baseline symptoms or signs were present in 93 (64.1%) children, without significant difference between the groups. Baseline TTG levels were >  × 10 ULN in all patients in group A and 71 (68.9%) in group B. Among these patients, the rate of TTG decline during follow-up did not differ at any time point between patients diagnosed with and without biopsy, and between patients with and without symptoms. At the last follow-up visit, 24 (57%) children in group A and 46 (65%) in group B had TTG <  × 3 ULN without significant difference between the groups. CONCLUSION: Rate of TTG decline did not differ between CeD patients diagnosed with and without biopsy, suggesting that, at least in short term, no biopsy approach may not change patients' adherence and families' attitude towards treatment. WHAT IS KNOWN: • Based on current guidelines, there is a rise in the incidence of pediatric celiac disease (CeD) diagnosis without an intestinal biopsy. • There is insufficient data regarding patients' adherence to treatment, including pattern of serology decline, based on the method of CeD diagnosis. WHAT IS NEW: • Children with CeD have similar baseline characteristics, including presence or absence of symptoms, whether diagnosed with or without biopsies. • During 18-month follow-up, the rate of celiac serology decline, and the reported adherence to treatment, do not differ between patients diagnosed based on biopsy or no biopsy approaches.",

      "abstract": "A decade of research on gluten-related disorders (GRDs) is reviewed in this study, with a particular emphasis on celiac disease (CD) and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). GRDs are triggered by the ingestion of gluten and gluten-like proteins found in wheat, barley, and rye. These proteins lead to intestinal damage in celiac disease, an autoimmune condition characterized by villous atrophy and a variety of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms. More enigmatic and less understood, NCGS involves symptoms similar to CD but without the immunological reaction or intestinal damage. Recent years have seen advances in the understanding of GRDs, particularly in connection to how intestinal microbiota influences disease progression and patient outcomes. The gluten-free diet (GFD) is still the standard therapy recommended for GRDs despite significant challenges, as discussed in this article. Precise diagnostic methods, patient education and dietary counseling are critical for improving patients' quality of life. The purpose of this review is to provide a more clear and up-to-date understanding of GRDs, and to help further research on this important topic.",

GF foods purchased in shops are typically more expensive than gluten-containing equivalents. This study sought to understand how New Zealanders with CD obtain GF products and the changes associated with this. METHOD: Coeliac New Zealand members were asked to complete an anonymous electronic survey in June 2023. RESULTS: Although 24% of the 522 respondents had accessed GF foods on prescription in the past, only 2% currently used the service. One-third of the respondents were unaware of the service. Cost and limited product range were the key reasons for not accessing prescriptions. Most non-prescription GF foods were purchased from a supermarket, with 54% spending over $50 per week on GF foods. Most respondents (90%) would prefer a discount card to purchase GF products. Preferences regarding the prescription service would be to collect products from a local shop (84%) or a pharmacy (42%). CONCLUSION: This study indicates a very low uptake of GF products on prescription, with awareness, cost, product range and convenience limiting use of the service. Most respondents would prefer financial support for discounted GF products.",

      "abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder exacerbated by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals, leading to intestinal inflammation and damage. This chronic disease affects approximately 1% of the world's population and is a growing health challenge due to its increasing prevalence. The development of CD is a complex interaction between genetic predispositions and environmental factors, especially gluten, culminating in a dysregulated immune response. The only effective treatment at present is a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet. However, adherence to this diet is challenging and often incomplete, so research into alternative therapies has intensified. Recent advances in understanding the molecular and immunological aspects of CD have spearheaded the development of novel pharmacologic strategies that should provide more effective and manageable treatment options. This review examines the latest innovations in CD therapies. The focus is on drugs in advanced clinical phases and targeting specific signaling pathways critical to the disease pathogenesis. We discuss both quantitative strategies such as enzymatic degradation of gluten, and qualitative approaches including immunomodulation and induction of gluten tolerance. Innovative treatments currently under investigation include transglutaminase inhibitors, which prevent the modification of gluten peptides, and nanoparticle-based therapies to recalibrate the immune response. These new therapies not only promise to improve patient outcomes but are also expected to improve quality of life by reducing the burden of dietary restrictions. The integration of these new therapies could revolutionize the treatment of CD and shift the paradigm from strict dietary restrictions to a more flexible and patient-friendly therapeutic approach. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the future prospects of CD treatment and emphasizes the importance of continued research and multidisciplinary collaboration to integrate these advances into standard clinical practice.",

One major challenge for these individuals is dining out, as they must constantly avoid cross-contact with gluten, contend with a limited range of restaurant options, and often encounter unknowledgeable or misinformed staff. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational program designed to enhance the understanding of CD and gluten-free diet (GFD) among future catering staff, thereby improving the social experiences of individuals with CD. A 3-h theoretical and practical session was developed for professional cookery students, focusing on predefined competencies and learning outcomes related to GFD. The study involved a sample of 100 students from Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Following the intervention, students demonstrated increased knowledge regarding gluten content in foods and the application of GFD principles, including cross-contact prevention. However, during the practical activity, the gluten-free dish they prepared was not safe for CD patients to consume. Additionally, the students' perception of the difficulty in providing a GFD remained unchanged. Future sessions should emphasise the importance of interpreting food labels and practising cross-contact prevention. The strong interest in training hospitality students to promote social inclusion of CD patients highlights the need for more programmes to enhance their dining options and safety."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the primary treatment of celiac disease (CeD), a gluten-driven enteropathy. Concerns have been raised about increased exposure to arsenic from a GFD because rice, which naturally bioaccumulates arsenic, is commonly used as a substitute for gluten-containing grains such as wheat. We hypothesize that arsenic exposure increases in newly diagnosed children with CeD after they adopt a GFD. METHODS: This is a single-center prospective longitudinal cohort study of children (age 2-18 years) with elevated celiac serology who underwent a diagnostic endoscopy before initiation of a GFD between January and May 2022. The primary outcome was change in urinary arsenic concentration between endoscopy and after 6 months on a GFD. RESULTS: Of the 67 recruited participants, 50 had a biopsy diagnostic of CeD and were invited to continue the study. Thirty-five participants completed sample collection. Participants were from a middle-class, well-educated population that was predominantly White with presenting symptoms of abdominal pain (51%) and diarrhea (29%). After 6 months on a GFD, there was a significant increase in the median urinary arsenic concentration (3.3 µg/L vs 13.6 µg/L, P = 0.000004). In regression models, family history of CeD and Hispanic ethnicity were associated with having a higher urinary arsenic concentration after 6 months on a GFD. DISCUSSION: Children with newly diagnosed CeD have increased arsenic exposure shortly after transitioning to a GFD. While the arsenic levels were well below acutely toxic concentrations, the clinical impact of chronic exposure to mildly elevated arsenic levels is unknown.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease is a common autoimmune-like enteropathy caused by an aberrant response to incompletely digested dietary gluten. Gluten immunogenic peptides including the immunodominant 33-mer are thought to be resistant to proteolytic digestion by human gastrointestinal peptidases. We developed a novel enzyme therapy approach to support gluten peptide digestion using a combination of two tandem-acting exopeptidases, AMYNOPEP, that complement the intrinsic enzymatic activity of intestinal brush border enterocytes. METHODS: We evaluated the effects of AMYNOPEP supplementation on 33-mer degradation in vitro and in vivo. In a cross-over clinical study, healthy volunteers with no gastrointestinal disorders were given stable isotope (SI) labelled 33-mer peptides in the presence of varying peptide substrates and caloric loads, with and without AMYNOPEP. 33-mer degradation products (SI-labelled single amino acids) were measured in the blood plasma using LC-MS/MS. RESULTS: AMYNOPEP achieved rapid, complete amino-to-carboxyl terminal degradation of the 33-mer in vitro, generating single amino acids and dipeptides. In healthy volunteers, AMYNOPEP supplementation significantly increased 33-mer degradation and absorption of SI-labelled amino acids even in the presence of competing substrates. Specifically, we observed a 2.8-fold increase in the Cmax of stable isotope-labelled amino acids in the presence of wheat gluten. The absorption kinetics of labelled amino acids derived from 33-mer digestion with AMYNOPEP closely resembled that of SI-labelled X-Proline dipeptides administered without enzyme supplementation, highlighting the rapid hydrolytic activity of AMYNOPEP on polypeptides. CONCLUSIONS: AMYNOPEP achieved complete degradation of the 33-mer into single amino acids and dipeptides in vitro and significantly improved 33-mer degradation kinetics in healthy volunteers, as measured by labelled amino acid detection, warranting further investigation into the potential therapeutic benefits of exopeptidase combinations for patients with gluten-related health disorders including celiac disease.",

This scoping review explores the intricate relationship between CD and cardiovascular manifestations, aiming to understand the impact of gluten-free diets (GFD) on cardiac health. A comprehensive search resulted in four pertinent studies revealing structural and functional abnormalities in the cardiovascular system of untreated CD patients. Among patients who did not adhere to a GFD, electrocardiogram abnormalities such as prolonged QT intervals and increased predisposition to arrhythmias were noted. Studies identified a significant prevalence of CD in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy or myocarditis, suggesting a potential association. GFD and immunosuppression were shown to improve cardiac function and reduce arrhythmias in CD patients exhibiting cardiovascular manifestations. However, limitations such as small sample sizes and incongruous cohorts make it difficult to assess the direct impact of GFD interventions on cardiac health. Future research should prioritize larger, longitudinal studies to fully understand mechanisms and treatment strategies. This review emphasizes the intricate interplay between CD and cardiac health, emphasizing the importance of early detection, comprehensive management, and further research for optimal clinical outcomes."

To resolve this problem, herein, a synergistic co-strengthening strategy was designed. The negatively charged polysaccharide carrageenan (CG) was introduced into MP simultaneously with wheat gluten, followed by 120 °C thermal treatment for 30 min. A substantial enhancement in mechanical strength, up to four times greater (from 9.86 to 42.38 g·cm), was observed for MP gels, which even surpassed that subjected to conventional gelation processes at 90 °C (36.53 g·cm). Gels that were concurrently added with gluten and CG exhibited porous networks, uniform water distribution, and improved water holding capacity. Accordingly, over-aggregation behaviors of MP were restricted, as evidenced by their reduced particle sizes and polymer dispersity index. Other heat-induced protein deteriorations at 120 °C, i.e., changes of secondary structures and disulfide bonding conformations, were also alleviated. By varying the CG types, it was shown that the κ-CG/gluten-added MP achieved highest gel strength, while the ι-CG/gluten combination may better stabilize the moisture in gel networks. This study introduces a co-reinforcement paradigm and scientific insights to the quality improvement of ready-to-eat meat products.",

The effects of vinegar residue arabinoxylan (VRAX) on the secondary structures and microstructures of gluten proteins during freeze-thaw storage were studied, and the underlying mechanism governing these effects was clarified. RESULTS: The results revealed that VRAX improved the textural properties of gluten proteins, but had a negative impact on their viscoelasticity. Additionally, the addition of VRAX increased the number of disulfide bonds and also improved the freezing tolerance of the gluten proteins. It was found that the enthalpy of the gluten proteins decreased by 19.78% following VRAX addition. As a result of the use of VRAX, the freezing procedure resulted in reduced formation of ice crystals, protecting the gluten network structure and preserving the dough's elasticity. The network structure of gluten proteins after VRAX treatment was more ordered and integrated relative to that of frozen blank control gluten proteins.

      "abstract": "Commercial Brazilian wheat flour was subjected to extrusion, oven, and microwave treatments. The solubility, monomeric and polymeric proteins, and the glutenin and gliadin profiles of the gluten were analyzed. In addition, in vitro digestibility and response against potential celiac disease immune-stimulatory epitopes were investigated. All treatments resulted in low solubility of the polymeric and monomeric proteins. The amounts of insoluble proteins increased from 5.6% in control flour to approximately 10% for all (treatments), whereas soluble proteins decreased from 6.5% to less than 0.5% post treatment. In addition, the treatments affected glutenin and gliadin profiles. The amount of α/β-gliadin extracted decreased after all treatments, while that of γ-gliadin was unaffected. Finally, the potential celiac disease immune stimulatory epitopes decreased in oven and microwave treatment using the G12 ELISA, but no change was observed using the R5 antibody. However, the alteration of the gluten structure and complexity was not sufficient to render a product safe for consumption for individuals with celiac disease; the number of potential celiac disease immune-stimulatory epitopes remained high."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The only treatment for Celiac Disease (CeD), which affects about 1% of the population, is a gluten-free diet (GFD). Studies have indicated an association between the GFD, a diminished quality of life (QOL), and maladaptive eating patterns. This study aims to explore food avoidance behaviors in adults with CeD. METHODS: This cross-sectional study assessed 50 adults with biopsy-confirmed CeD who completed validated surveys evaluating demographics, psychological factors, QOL, eating pathology, and food avoidance. RESULTS: Overall CDQOL scores were good (mean: 62.7 out of 100). However, 58.0% of the participants self-elected to avoid one or more additional foods without diagnosed allergies or intolerances. Those avoiding one or more other foods had lower QOL scores (57.4 (23.2) vs. 70.2 (15.9)) compared to those only avoiding gluten (p = 0.034). The mean depression score (CESD) for the group avoiding foods beyond gluten was in the depressive range, unlike those avoiding only gluten (16.0 (4.9) vs. 13.6 (4.0), p = 0.078), with 77% of those avoiding more than gluten scoring above the CESD cut-off point of 15, indicating clinical depression. CONCLUSIONS: Over half of participants (58%) reported avoiding additional foods beyond the GFD, a behavior associated with decreased QOL and increased depression.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Common gastrointestinal disease irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is marked by symptoms like changed bowel habits, bloating, and stomach ache. A low-FODMAP combined gluten-free diet (LF-GFD) has been suggested as a possible therapy for IBS symptoms management. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to investigate whether a LF-GFD would help patients with IBS. METHODS: Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria from internet databases helped to identify clinical studies evaluating the intervention of LF-GFD in the treatment of IBS patients. Using measurements including the visual analog scale (VAS) for bloating and pain, the IBS symptom severity scale (IBS-SSS), and IBS quality of life (IBS-QoL), the main results evaluated were the efficacy of LF-GFD in reducing IBS symptoms. Furthermore assessed were the psychological impacts of LF-GFD utilizing the self- rating depression scale (SDS) and self- rating anxiety scale (SAS). RESULTS: A total of 437 patients (221 on LF-GFD diet and 216 on GFD) were involved in 4 randomized controlled trials and 4 cohort studies. The combined results indicated that LF-GFD reduced the VAS bloating ratings (RR = - 0.58, 95%CI - 0.92-0.23, P = 0.0010, I2 = 83%) and the VAS pain scores (RR = - 0.42, 95%CI - 0.66-0.19, P = 0.005, I2 = 58%). In addition, LF-GFD indicated a substantial enhancement in IBS-SSS scores (MD = - 1.42, 95%CI - 2.74-0.10, P = 0.03, I2 = 24%) and IBS-QoL ratings (MD = 3.75, 95%CI 0.98-6.53, P = 0.008, I2 = 33%). Moreover, the LF-GFD group showed a substantial drop in SDS (MD = - 2.56, 95%CI - 3.38-1.74, P < 0.00001, I2 = 65%) and SAS (MD = - 4.30, 95%CI - 6.53-2.24, P < 0.0001, I2 = 0%) scores compared to the GFD group. CONCLUSION: LF-GFD therapy significantly enhances clinical symptoms and reduces anxiety and depression in individuals diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome.",

      "abstract": "The development of a technological scheme for the production of cereal snacks based on the extrusion process with preliminary enzymatic treatment of wheat flour and the use of hydrolysate as a partial replacement for gluten-free raw materials is an urgent task. The use of gluten-free cereal snacks in the diet opens up new possibilities for dietary therapy in patients suffering from various manifestations of food allergy to gluten, making their diet more diverse and meeting their individual needs. The purpose of the research was to clinically evaluate the tolerance of gluten-free cereal snacks in children with PA to gluten. Material and methods. The study included 21 patients (male and female) aged 3 to 17 years with a diagnosed food allergy, including gluten. All children received gluten-free cereal snacks according to their age: children from 3 to 7 years old (n=11) received 50 g (176 kcal) daily, and children aged 8 to 17 years old (n=10) received 100 g (352 kcal) daily for 14 days, in addition to a non-specific hypoallergenic diet excluding highly allergenic foods. On the first day of the study, the patients or one of their parents evaluated the organoleptic properties of the presented product (taste, color, smell) using a 5-point scale (1 - very bad, 5 - excellent), according to a specially designed questionnaire. The assessment of clinical symptoms over time related to skin, gastrointestinal tract, and nervous system was conducted using a second questionnaire, where parents kept a daily «observation log» reflecting the child's well-being and condition, as well as adverse events associated with taking the product. Clinical safety parameters were assessed based on the dynamics of complete blood count and blood immunological parameters (total IgE, specific IgE, and IgG4 antibodies to the studied allergens) at the beginning and end of the consumption period. Results. Daily examinations and patient questionnaires revealed no adverse reactions to the product. No significant differences in body weight were observed at the end of the study (p>0.05). In the results of clinical and immunological blood analysis before and after consuming gluten-free cereal snacks, no significant deviations were observed in the form of an increase in eosinophil count, total IgE, allergen-specific IgE and IgG4 antibodies in peripheral blood. This suggests a favorable clinical safety profile of the proposed product. Conclusion. The study found that consumption of the new product (gluten-free cereal snacks) was well-tolerated by children aged 3 to 17 years with various manifestations of food allergy: no adverse effects of the product or exacerbations of the underlying disease were observed during the 14-day period of gluten-free cereal snack consumption. Therefore, the studied gluten-free cereal snacks can be recommended for children aged 3 to 17 years with various manifestations of gluten FA, in combination with a gluten free diet.",

      "abstract": "The study of gluten intolerance is a modern area of medical science. With the advent of new diagnostic capabilities and data on the forms of the disease, wide opportunities have opened up in optimizing the timing and invasiveness reducing of intervention during diagnosis and further monitoring of the child's health. However, despite all efforts, the basic method of treating all forms of gluten intolerance remains strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). It is known that GFD itself, as well as low adherence to its observance can lead to nutritional disorders. Therefore, the expansion of the diet at the expense of foods with high nutritional value will greatly contribute to the optimization of diet therapy and compensation for food restrictions. The purpose of the review was to evaluate the possibility of using amaranth products in a GFD to fill the need for nutrients in children with gluten intolerance. Material and methods. The search for literature data was carried out using PubMed, eLIBRARY, scholar.google platforms mainly over the last 5 years, using the keywords: gluten intolerance, children, amaranth, gluten-free diet. Results. An analysis of modern literary sources has shown that amaranth is a product of choice in diet therapy when following a GFD, since it is a pseudo-grain crop. The article presents data confirming the high nutritional value of amaranth due to the protein component and the features of the lipid fraction. The features of the amino acid composition and squalene content in comparison with other plant crops are discussed. The article contains information on the preservation of the beneficial properties of amaranth in finished foods, in particular, the addition of amaranth flour instead of corn starch increases the protein content by 32% and fiber by 152% in gluten-free bread without affecting the taste. The advantages of the chemical composition of amaranth are shown in comparison with other pseudo-cereals. The research results prove the effectiveness of using amaranth products in GFD to eliminate deficiency states in patients, normalize physical development in children with gluten intolerance, and increase patient adherence to the diet. Conclusion. The composition of amaranth and the available studies on the effectiveness of amaranth products consumption convincingly prove the advisability of using it in nutrition, especially under dietary restrictions or increased need for nutrients in childhood.",

      "abstract": "Gluten-free diets are characterized by lower nutritional quality. The use of green plantain flour in gluten-free formulations appears as an alternative to overcome this deficiency, considering that green plantains have a relevant content of bioactive compounds, dietary fiber, including resistant starch. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of the addition of native and modified by hydrothermal treatment green plantain whole flours in the form of gluten-free cupcakes. The density, yield, and microstructure of the dough, specific volume (SV), height, crumb analysis, color, texture, and sensory acceptability of the cupcakes were evaluated. Partial replacement (40%) of rice flour by native and modified flours produced darker, redder cupcakes, less yellowish and with less color intensity. Sensory analysis revealed higher acceptance for cupcakes with native and modified flours, compared to the control, for appearance, flavor, texture, aroma, and overall acceptance. The native flour was the most viable option, as the cupcake produced with it showed the best values for hardness and chewiness, without changing elasticity and SV, in addition to superior sensory acceptance than the control and similar to cupcakes with other modified flours. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Pursuing to meet the market demand for gluten-free products, with the cake being one of the most requested products in this market, and taking in account that green banana, from different cultivars, has gained interest for the production of flours. The production of flour and bakery products is of great interest to the food industry, not only because of its flavor and properties but also due to the economic and sustainable viability of producing whole green plantain flour with the potential for application, promoting diversification and innovation in the gluten-free functional products market.",

There is renewed interest in dietary changes to optimize treatment regimens, with a growing body of evidence suggesting beneficial effects with adherence to a gluten-free diet. This study compared the likelihood of achieving clinical response to biological treatment after 14-16 weeks in patients with CID with high versus low-to-medium gluten intake. Secondary outcomes of interest included changes in disease activity, health-related quality of life and C-reactive protein. The study was a multicentre prospective cohort of 193 participants with a CID diagnosis (i.e. Crohn's Disease, Ulcerative Colitis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Axial Spondyloarthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis or Psoriasis) who initiated biological treatment between 2017 and 2020. Participants were stratified based on their habitual gluten intake: the upper 33.3% (high gluten intake) and the remaining 66.6% (low-to-medium gluten intake). The proportion of patients achieving clinical response to biological treatment after 14-16 weeks was compared using logistic regression models. The median gluten intake differed significantly between groups (12.5 g/day vs. 5.9 g/day, standardized mean difference = 1.399). In total, 108 (56%) achieved clinical response to treatment, with no difference between 35 (55%) in the high gluten group and 73 (57%) in the medium-to-low gluten group (OR = 0.96 [0.51-1.79], p = 0.897). No differences were found with secondary outcomes. In conclusion, this study found no association between gluten intake and response to biological treatment in patients with CID.",

Totally 19 articles met the eligible criteria and were included. Pooled findings indicated that intervention with GFD has a significantly beneficial effect on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (WMD: 4.80 mg/dl, 95% CI: 2.09, 7.51, P = 0.001), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (WMD: -2.96 mmHg; 95% CI: -4.11, -1.81, P < 0.001), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (WMD: -0.40, mg/l, 95% CI: -0.67, -0.14, P = 0.002) levels.

Due to fortification rules excluding gluten-free products in the United States of America (U.S.A.), understanding the nutritional adequacy of a GFD is important for promoting optimal health among those with CeD. Cross-sectional examination of multiple 24 h dietary recalls from a study sample of 50 adults and 30 teens with CeD was used to determine nutritional adequacy and excesses according to U.S.A. recommendations. The results were compared with those of 15,777 adults and 2296 teens from a nationally representative sample not reporting CeD, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009-2014. Compared with NHANES, our study population was more at risk of low folate and carbohydrate (adults) consumption, and of excessive niacin and vitamin A (teens), as well as saturated and total fat consumption (adults). Overall, though, compared with NHANES, our study participants had similar nutrient concerns but fewer nutritional imbalances, with some notable exceptions. In addition to maintaining a GFD, individuals with CeD should be counseled to maintain a balanced diet and to pay attention to nutrient-dense foods. Special attention should be given to teens in providing dietary counseling to potentially mitigate the risk of future morbidity.",

      "abstract": "Celiac disease, a serious autoimmune disease, is triggered by the ingestion of gluten. It is associated with many gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms. The cornerstone of treatment is a strict gluten-free diet (GFD). This paper collected studies that were screened between the 15th and 25th of June 2024 and were searched for from many databases and registers, including PubMed, Medline, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Library, Europe PMC, and EBSCO Open Dissertations. We have included the 12 most relevant studies that examined the effects of GFD adherence among pediatric patients with celiac disease. Evidence suggests that a GFD caused notable improvements in liver function, growth metrics, and quality of life indices. Extraintestinal symptoms such as cardiac dysfunctions and obstructive sleep apnea also showed compelling improvement. We conclude that there are substantial advantages of a GFD in children with celiac disease and call for the need for personal nutritional support to address nutritional deficiencies and long-term studies and comprehensive strategies to optimize treatment outcomes and improve the quality of life for affected children."

      "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of aqueous ozone (AO) on the yield, molecular structure, and rheological properties of wheat gluten separated using the batter procedure. Employing strong gluten flour (SGF) and weak gluten flour (WGF), we demonstrate that AO pretreatment significantly enhances the yield and purity of separated starch and gluten. Surface hydrophobicity, free sulfhydryl groups, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman, and size exclusion-high-performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC) analyses were used to evaluate the effects of AO on the molecular structure of gluten. Our analysis reveals that low concentrations of AO induce specific modifications in gluten proteins. AO treatment increases cross-linking in glutenin macropolymer (GMP), reduces surface hydrophobicity, and stabilizes secondary and tertiary structures. These changes include an increase in β-sheet content by approximately 9% and a corresponding decrease in β-turn structures, leading to enhanced viscoelastic properties of the gluten. The research highlights AO's potential as a sustainable and efficient agent in wheat flour processing, offering advancements in both product quality and eco-friendly processing techniques. Future research should optimize AO treatment parameters and explore its effects on different cereal types further to enhance its applicability and benefits in food processing. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Our work substantially advances the existing knowledge on wheat flour processing by demonstrating the multifaceted benefits of AO pretreatment. We unveil significant improvements in the yield and purity of starch and gluten when compared to conventional separation methods. Moreover, our in-depth analysis of molecular changes induced by AO, including increased cross-linking, alterations in surface hydrophobicity, and modifications in glutenin macropolymer content, provides new insights into how AO affects the viscoelastic properties of gluten. This contribution is pivotal for the development of more efficient, sustainable, and eco-friendly wheat flour processing technologies.",

      "abstract": "Celiac disease is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease of the small bowel, and about 1% of the world's population is afflicted with celiac disease. To date, the most efficient treatment option is that the patient is required to strictly follow a gluten-free diet for their entire life, but it's difficult to adhere to and can lead to new nutritional imbalances, making it urgent to find novel nutritional interventions. Our aim was to explore the effects of nutritional intervention with quercetin on the celiac toxic effects of wheat gluten. This study systematically assessed the regulatory roles of quercetin on intestinal oxidative damage, immune response, inflammatory damage, and intestinal microflora dysbiosis in celiac disease by utilizing the established celiac in vitro and in vivo models induced by gluten. We discovered that quercetin could play a crucial role in intervening in celiac pathogenesis, not only owing to its antioxidant properties, but also because it modulates immune cell function and the intestinal microflora structure, particularly the regulation of Th1/Th2/Treg immune cell subpopulations and their functions, inhibition of the abundance of celiac disease marker flora such as Clostridium_celatum and Bacteroides_acidifaciens, and upregulation of the abundance of beneficial flora such as Butyricoccus_pullicaecorum and Bifidobacterium_longum, which ultimately worked together to ameliorate the celiac-related intestinal inflammation triggered by gluten. This study might provide new insights into the regulation of gut immunity and intestinal microflora homeostasis, as well as the potential application of quercetin in celiac disease.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of celiac disease (CeD) is increasing, yet it is still underdiagnosed, in part because of its heterogeneous presentation. Diagnostic criteria are evolving and management with strict adherence to a gluten-free diet is challenging for many. We aimed to characterize the clinical presentation of CeD among a large multicenter cohort of pediatric patients and to identify factors associated with gluten-free diet adherence. METHODS: Patients with CeD aged 0-18 years were recruited from 11 United States health centers. Parents completed surveys about gluten-free diet adherence and patient electronic health records were reviewed. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors associated with gluten exposure. RESULTS: Charts were reviewed for 460 children with a median age of 6.4 years. Abdominal pain was reported in 57% of the cohort, but diverse symptoms were identified. Parent surveys were completed for 455 participants. Sixty-five (14%) participants were at high risk for gluten exposure based on parental reports of weekly or daily gluten exposure or eating gluten by choice in the past year. Participants under the age of 5 years had a lower risk of gluten exposure, while participants without repeat serology testing 18 months after initial diagnosis were at higher risk of gluten exposure. CONCLUSIONS: In a large, multicenter cohort of pediatric CeD patients, clinical presentation is highly variable, necessitating a high index of suspicion to make a diagnosis. Parent surveys indicate that 14% of patients are at high risk of gluten exposure, with patient age and lack of close follow-up associated with gluten-free diet adherence.",

Limited education about the disease and a GFD is an attributing factor to inadequate adherence. Thus, our aim was to assess the current knowledge about a GFD and the clinical monitoring of adherence to the diet among CeD people and HCPs. Specific questionnaires were designed and distributed to assess the knowledge of CeD people (Q1 questionnaire) (n = 2437) and to analyze the follow-up of the disease from the perspective of patients (Q2 questionnaire) (n = 1294) and HCPs (Q3 questionnaire) (n = 346). Two-thirds of HCPs specialized in pediatric care, while one-third did so in adult care. In CeD people, general questions regarding food classification and cross-contamination are well understood. When patients have doubts, 51.4% reported using the Internet and social networks. Thus, it is crucial that resources like social media are reliable and provide valuable information. Q3 revealed the lack of time to follow up the diet after diagnosis (48% of HCPs allocate < 15 min), the interest in further training, and the need for a professional specialized in diets within the healthcare system. In conclusion, it is essential to enhance nutritional education to increase awareness of a GFD.",

      "abstract": "This systematic review aimed to find the tool that best predicts celiac individuals' adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). The Transparent Reporting of Multivariable Prediction Models for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD-SRMA) guideline was used for the construction and collection of data from eight scientific databases (PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, Web of Science, LIVIVO, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and Proquest) on 16 November 2023. The inclusion criteria were studies involving individuals with celiac disease (CD) who were over 18 years old and on a GFD for at least six months, using a questionnaire to predict adherence to a GFD, and comparing it with laboratory tests (serological tests, gluten immunogenic peptide-GIP, or biopsy). Review articles, book chapters, and studies without sufficient data were excluded. The Checklist for Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modeling Studies (CHARMS) was used for data collection from the selected primary studies, and their risk of bias and quality was assessed using the Prediction Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). The association between the GFD adherence determined by the tool and laboratory test was assessed using the phi contingency coefficient. The studies included in this review used four different tools to evaluate GFD adherence: BIAGI score, Coeliac Dietary Adherence Test (CDAT), self-report questions, and interviews. The comparison method most often used was biopsy (n = 19; 59.3%), followed by serology (n = 14; 43.7%) and gluten immunogenic peptides (GIPs) (n = 4; 12.5%). There were no significant differences between the interview, self-report, and BIAGI tools used to evaluate GFD adherence. These tools were better associated with GFD adherence than the CDAT. Considering their cost, application time, and prediction capacity, the self-report and BIAGI were the preferred tools for evaluating GFD adherence.",

      "abstract": "With breast cancer emerging as a pressing global health challenge, characterized by escalating incidence rates and geographical disparities, there is a critical need for innovative therapeutic strategies. This comprehensive research navigates the landscape of nanomedicine, specifically focusing on the potential of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), with magnetite (Fe3O4) taking center stage. MNPs, encapsulated in biocompatible polymers like silica known as magnetic silica nanoparticles (MSN), are augmented with phosphotungstate (PTA) for enhanced chemodynamic therapy (CDT). PTA is recognized for its dual role as a natural chelator and electron shuttle, expediting electron transfer from ferric (Fe3+) to ferrous (Fe2+) ions within nanoparticles. Additionally, protein-based charge-reversal nanocarriers like silk sericin and gluten are introduced to encapsulate (MSN-PTA) nanoparticles, offering a dynamic facet to drug delivery systems for potential revolutionization of breast cancer therapy. This study successfully formulates and characterizes protein-coated nanocapsules, specifically MSN-PTA-SER, and MSN-PTA-GLU, with optimal physicochemical attributes for drug delivery applications. The careful optimization of sericin and gluten concentrations results in finely tuned nanoparticles, showcasing uniform size, enhanced negative zeta potential, and remarkable stability. Various analyses, from Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-Ray diffraction analysis (XRD), and Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), provide insights into structural integrity and surface modifications. Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM) analysis underscores superparamagnetic behavior, positioning these nanocapsules as promising candidates for targeted drug delivery. In vitro evaluations demonstrate dose-dependent inhibition of cell viability in MCF-7 and Zr-75-1 breast cancer cells, emphasizing the therapeutic potential of MSN-PTA-SER and MSN-PTA-GLU. The interplay of surface charge and pH-dependent cellular uptake highlights the robust stability and versatility of these nanocarriers in tumor microenvironment, paving the way for advancements in targeted drug delivery and personalized nanomedicine. This comparative analysis explores the suitability of silk sericin and gluten, unraveling a promising avenue for the development of advanced, targeted, and efficient breast cancer treatments.",

Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disorder triggered by dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Although avoiding gluten can permit patients to live symptom-free, ongoing voluntary or involuntary exposure to gluten is common and associated with persistent villous atrophy in small bowel mucosa. As villous atrophy predisposes patients to life threatening complications, such as osteoporotic fractures or malignancies, therapeutic adjuncts to gluten-free diet become important to improve patients' quality of life and, if these adjuncts can be shown to improve villous atrophy, avoid complications. Oral administration of enzyme preparations, such as endopeptidases that digest gluten and mitigate its antigenicity to trigger inflammation, is one clinical strategy under investigation. The article is about the utility of one endopeptidase isolated from Aspergillus niger. We critique findings of this clinical trial and also summarize endopeptidase-based as well as other strategies and how they can complement gluten-free diet in the management of celiac disease.",

      "abstract": "Celiac disease - a prevalent food intolerance - requires strict adherence to a lifelong gluten-free (GF) diet as the only effective treatment. However, GF products often lack soluble fibre and have a high glycaemic index. Consequently, there is a pressing need in the food industry to develop GF products with improved nutritional profiles. In this context, the impact of incorporating orange peel flour (OPF) into muffins undergoing sourdough fermentation was examined, focusing on their technological, antioxidant, and nutritional characteristics. The functional properties of OPF were investigated using human colon carcinoma HCT8 cells as a model system. Treatment with OPF extract demonstrated a notable reduction in malignant cell viability and intracellular ROS levels, indicating potent antioxidant capabilities. Western blot analysis revealed significant alterations in key signalling pathways, including increased phosphorylation of NF-kB at serine 536 and reduced intracellular levels of caspase-3, alongside increased phosphorylation of RIPK3 and MLKL, suggesting potential involvement in necroptosis. OPF incorporation in muffins with sourdough increased antioxidant activity, reduced glycaemic index, and affected the volatile profile. Furthermore, based on simulated colonic fermentation, muffins with OPF showed a slight prebiotic effect, supported by the significant increase in bacillus-shaped lactic acid bacteria and Clostridia population. Overall, OPF-enriched muffins demonstrated considerable antioxidant effects and impacts on cell viability, underscoring their potential as functional ingredients in GF products. These findings signify the prospect of OPF enhancing the nutritional profiles and conferring health benefits of GF muffins.",

      "abstract": "Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent chronic disease characterized by the presence of endometriumlike tissue outside the uterus and is often associated with symptoms, such as dysmenorrhea, dysuria, dyschezia, chronic pelvic pain, and infertility. Moreover, women diagnosed with endometriosis can report gastrointestinal symptoms, including bloating, constipation or diarrhea, and abdominal cramping, which can be associated with irritable bowel syndrome and can result in the misdiagnosis of endometriosis as irritable bowel syndrome at first. Treatment usually involves hormonal therapy, pain management, surgery, and/or assisted reproductive techniques in case of infertility. Nonetheless, these treatment methods can be insufficient for alleviating symptoms or can have unacceptable side effects, leading to noncompliance. Therefore, women often apply self-management strategies, including dietary interventions. One of the diets frequently suggested as a tool to manage endometriosis-related symptoms on social media and patient forums is a gluten-free diet. Although a gluten-free diet has been proven effective in managing nonceliac wheat sensitivity or celiac disease, its effectiveness in endometriosis remains uncertain. The Nurses' Health Study II found it unlikely that gluten intake was a strong factor in endometriosis etiology and symptomatology. To the best of our knowledge, the most frequently cited and sole published intervention study on the efficacy of a gluten-free diet for endometriosis has several important limiting factors, including the absence of a control group. In addition, gluten consumption is highly susceptible to a placebo effect and a nocebo effect, where women might experience symptom relief after eliminating gluten and return of symptoms after they consume gluten again, solely because they believe that gluten is bad for them. Despite the inverse association between body mass index and endometriosis and between a gluten-free diet and increased body mass index, this is an association, and no causality was proven. In addition, other factors should be taken into consideration. Of note, a gluten-free diet is expensive, has limited availability, and has a significant effect on quality of life. Moreover, without proper dietary guidance, it may adversely affect the gastrointestinal microbiome. Therefore, scientifically substantiated advice regarding the use of a gluten-free diet for endometriosis-related symptoms is currently not available, and a gluten-free diet should be discouraged unless there is an additional diagnosis of nonceliac wheat sensitivity or celiac disease."

Upon extensive workup, positive findings were cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showing lymphocytic pleocytosis with oligoclonal bands, positive celiac disease autoantibodies in blood, a duodenal biopsy indicating lymphocytic infiltration, and positive anti-mGluR1 antibody titers in CSF. The patient was started on a strict gluten-free diet and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy for 5 days and showed mild consecutive improvements each day of treatment. He was discharged after 22 days, and was encouraged to continue gluten adherence, physical and speech therapy, and follow up with neuroimmunology. This report demonstrates that autoimmune encephalitis due to anti-mGluR1antibodies and gluten ataxia are both immune-mediated disorders that should be considered in acute cerebellar ataxia cases. By broadening the differential diagnosis and a comprehensive CSF analysis, identification of gluten ataxia and autoimmune encephalitis were beneficial in the management of this particular patient.",

      "abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten-containing food by genetically predisposed individuals. Hence, treatment of CD consists of permanent avoidance of wheat, rye, barley, and other gluten-containing foods. Lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) improves the symptoms of CD, but recent evidence suggests it is also associated with a higher risk for hepatic steatosis and the coexistence or emergence of other cardiometabolic risk factors. Moreover, a higher risk for liver steatosis is also reported by some authors as a potential extraintestinal complication of the CD itself. Recent nomenclature changes designate the association between hepatic steatosis and at least one of five cardiometabolic risk factors as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). An extended network of potentially causative factors underlying the association between MAFLD and CD, before and after dietary therapy is implemented, was recently described. The individualized treatment of these patients is less supported by evidence, with most of the current recommendations relying on empiric clinical judgment. This review focuses on the causative associations between CD and hepatic injury, either as an extraintestinal manifestation of CD or a side effect of GFD, also referring to potential therapeutic strategies for these individuals.",

The results demonstrated that HB addition increased the water absorption, weakened the extensibility, increased the storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G″), decreased tan δ (G\"/G') of dough. The textural and stress relaxation results showed that HB increased the hardness and elastic modulus (E2) of the dough, requiring more stress to compress the dough. Also, the increase in sulfhydryl and surface hydrophobicity all confirmed the addition of HB induced the deterioration of gluten network structure. Furthermore, HMT-HB improved farinograph quality number of flour, decreased tan δ of dough compared with HB. The E2, coefficient of viscosity (η) and hardness increased, while the relaxation time (τ) decreased with increasing HMT strength of HB, suggesting the formation of a tighter dough structure. The secondary structure and microstructure analyses revealed that the HMT could reduce the damage of HB to dough quality. These results indicated that HMT had the potential to enhance the interaction between starch and protein, leading to a denser dough matrix. This study facilitates the basic theory for the comprehensive utilization of HB in the food industry.",

Here, we elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the efficacy of the TG2 inhibitor ZED1227 by performing transcriptional analysis of duodenal biopsies from individuals with CeD on a long-term gluten-free diet before and after a 6-week gluten challenge combined with 100 mg per day ZED1227 or placebo. At the transcriptome level, orally administered ZED1227 effectively prevented gluten-induced intestinal damage and inflammation, providing molecular-level evidence that TG2 inhibition is an effective strategy for treating CeD. ZED1227 treatment preserved transcriptome signatures associated with mucosal morphology, inflammation, cell differentiation and nutrient absorption to the level of the gluten-free diet group. Nearly half of the gluten-induced gene expression changes in CeD were associated with the epithelial interferon-γ response. Moreover, data suggest that deamidated gluten-induced adaptive immunity is a sufficient step to set the stage for CeD pathogenesis. Our results, with the limited sample size, also suggest that individuals with CeD might benefit from an HLA-DQ2/HLA-DQ8 stratification based on gene doses to maximally eliminate the interferon-γ-induced mucosal damage triggered by gluten.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Globally, approximately 1.4% of people have celiac disease (CD), induced by gluten sensitivity. If left untreated, it causes small intestinal inflammation and villous atrophy, which can result in failure to thrive, anemia, osteoporosis, malabsorption, and even malignancy. The only treatment option available is a gluten-free diet (GFD). Few studies have looked at the role and perception of telehealth in relation to CD and selective nutrition both before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. AIM: Our goal was to screen and investigate the research conducted both before and after the COVID-19 pandemic concerning the utilization of telehealth applications and solutions in CD and other GFD-dependent circumstances. METHODS: We employed a narrative review approach to explore articles that were published in scholarly journals or organizations between the years 2000 and 2024. Only English-language publications were included. PubMed and Google Scholar searches were mainly conducted using the following keywords: telemedicine, telehealth, telecare, eHealth, m-health, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, celiac disease, and gluten-free diet (GFD). Manual searches of the references in the acquired literature were also carried out, along with the authors' own personal contributions of their knowledge and proficiency in this field. RESULTS: Only a few studies conducted prior to the COVID-19 outbreak examined the viewpoints and experiences of adult patients with CD with relation to in-person clinic visits, as well as other options such as telehealth. The majority of patients believed that phone consultations were appropriate and beneficial. Video conferencing and telemedicine became more popular during the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating the effectiveness of using these technologies for CD on a global basis. In recent years, urine assays for gluten identification have become accessible for use at home. These tests could be helpful for CD monitoring with telemedicine assistance. CONCLUSIONS: The extended knowledge gathered from the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to complement pre-COVID-19 data supporting the usefulness of telemedicine even after the emergent pandemic, encouraging its wider adoption in standard clinical practice. The monitoring and follow-up of CD patients and other GFD-dependent conditions can greatly benefit from telemedicine."

Non-celiac gluten sensitivity presents with symptoms similar to celiac disease with the ingestion of gluten or other components of wheat. In this article, we review challenges presented by a gluten free diet for the treatment of both disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Wheat is ubiquitous in the diet and medications/products. A registered dietitian is mandatory for patient education on the gluten free diet. Naturally gluten free foods provide a healthy diet for those with celiac disease. Whole grains labelled gluten free, including oats, are encouraged in the diet as refined grains may be deficient in fiber, protein, and micronutrients, particularly folate. Gluten contamination is the most common cause of persistent symptoms in celiac disease though shared equipment of food preparation may not be as large a problem as suspected. Most with celiac disease on a gluten free diet will fully recover and gain weight that poses a problem for those overweight to start. The gluten free diet may have a negative impact on quality of life for both celiac patients and their families. Those with hypervigilance of the gluten free diet and avoidance of dining out have the lowest quality of life. The gluten free diet is currently the only effective treatment for celiac disease. A registered dietitian is needed to educate patients on the complexity of the gluten free diet with a goal of healthy eating, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding disordered eating or diet hypervigilance; key to a good quality of life.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Gluten possesses unique properties that render it only partially digestible. Consequently, it exerts detrimental effects on a part of the worldwide population who are afflicted with celiac disease (1%) or related disorders (5%), particularly due to the potential for cross-contamination even when adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Finding solutions to break down gluten during digestion has a high nutritional and social impact. Here, a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled in vivo challenge investigated the gluten-degrading activity of a novel probiotic preparation comprising lactobacilli and their cytoplasmic extracts, Bacillus sp., and bacterial protease. In our clinical trial, we collected feces from 70 healthy volunteers at specific time intervals. Probiotic/placebo administration lasted 32 days, followed by 10 days of wash-out. After preliminary GFD to eliminate residual gluten from feces, increasing amounts of gluten (50 mg-10 g) were administered, each one for 4 consecutive days. Compared to placebo, the feces of volunteers fed with probiotics showed much lower amounts of residual gluten, mainly with increased intakes. Probiotics also regulate the intestinal microbial communities, improving the abundance of genera pivotal to maintaining homeostasis. Quantitative PCR confirmed that all probiotics persisted during the intervention, some also during wash-out. Probiotics promoted a fecal metabolome with potential immunomodulating activity, mainly related to derivatives of branched-chain amino acids and short-chain fatty acids. IMPORTANCE: The untapped potential of gluten-degrading bacteria and their application in addressing the recognized limitations of gluten-related disorder management and the ongoing risk of cross-contamination even when people follow a gluten-free diet (GFD) emphasizes the significance of the work. Because gluten, a common protein found in many cereals, must be strictly avoided to stop autoimmune reactions and related health problems, celiac disease and gluten sensitivity present difficult hurdles. However, because of the hidden presence of gluten in many food products and the constant danger of cross-contamination during food preparation and processing, total avoidance is frequently challenging. Our study presents a novel probiotic preparation suitable for people suffering from gluten-related disorders during GFD and for healthy individuals because it enhances gluten digestion and promotes gut microbiota functionality.",

To prevent the production of immunogenic gluten peptides, the stimulation of covalent-type protein-polyphenol interactions may be promising. In this study, gluten interacted with green tea extract (GTE) at pH 9 to promote the covalent-type gluten-polyphenol interactions, and the number of immunogenic gluten peptides, 19-mer, 26-mer, and 33-mer, was monitored after in vitro digestion. Treatment of gluten with GTE provided an increased antioxidant capacity, decreased amino group content, and increased thermal properties. More importantly, there was a remarkable (up to 73%) elimination of immunogenic gluten peptide release after the treatment of gluten with 2% GTE at 50 °C and pH 9 for 2 h. All of these confirmed that gluten was efficiently modified by GTE polyphenols under the stated conditions. These findings are important in developing new strategies for the development of gluten-free or low-gluten food products with reduced immunogenicity."

The effect of the molecular structure of extruded pregelatinization starch on the dough's rheological properties and the brown rice bread's quality was investigated. Extruded rice starch (ERS) was prepared with various added moisture contents of 20 % (ERS20), 30 % (ERS30), and 40 % (ERS40), respectively. ERS had smaller molecular weight and more short branched chains as the moisture content decreased. The dough elasticity and deformation resistance were improved with the ERS supplementation and in the order of ERS40 > ERS30 > ERS20 at the same level. Fortification with ERS improved the gluten-free brown rice bread quality. Compared to the control group, breadcrumbs supplemented with ERS20 at the 10 % level showed an increase in cell density from 17.87 cm-2 to 28.32 cm-2, a decrease in mean cell size from 1.22 mm2 to 0.81 mm2, and no significant change in cell area fraction. In addition, the specific volume increased from 1.50 cm3/g to 2.04 cm3/g, the hardness decreased from 14.34 N to 6.28 N, and the springiness increased from 0.56 to 0.74.

As the duration of starch debranching treatment increased from 0 to 8 h, the viscoelasticity of the gel containing debranched starch (DBS) improved. Compared with the gluten gel (G), the gel strength of the G + DBS (8 h) sample increased by 65.2 %. The degradation temperature of gluten was minimally affected by DBS, while the weight loss rate increased by 4.4 %. Furthermore, the α-helical structure of gluten decreased, concomitant with an increase in β-sheet content. Notably, DBS treated for 8 h exhibited more hydrogen bonds with the tyrosine of gluten and triggered disulfide bridge conformation to transition from g-g-g to t-g-g, thereby reducing the stability of the molecular conformation of gluten proteins, as evidenced by the decreased height and width of the molecular chains observed in atomic force microscopy images. Overall, the composite gel structure induced by DBS exhibited a more continuous and homogeneous owing to the improved compatibility between DBS and gluten proteins, favoring the formation of a robust gel. These findings provide valuable insights for utilizing DBS to enhance gluten gel properties.",

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on disease severity, quality of life, and inflammatory markers in patients with UC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this triple-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial, we evaluated the effect of a GFD on the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), fecal calprotectin, disease severity, and quality of life in patients with mild to moderate UC. Patients' quality of life and severity of symptoms were evaluated using the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) and Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI), respectively. Patients received this regimen for six weeks and were evaluated before and after the intervention. RESULTS: The mean age of patients (n = 26) was 39.31 years (standard deviation = 9.34). In both study groups, the mean ESR, CRP, IBDQ, and SCCAI showed no statistically significant improvement with the dietary intervention. Fecal calprotectin was increased in both groups without statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: We could not find any significant effect of GFD on inflammatory markers, quality of life, and disease severity among patients with mild to moderate UC. It is too early to suggest the gluten-free diet as a safe and beneficial regimen for UC patients. There is a need for further investigations with larger sample sizes and longer follow-ups as clinical trials and cohort studies to obtain more reliable results.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The human gut microbiota is composed of many viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Escherichia coli representatives are facultative anaerobic bacteria in the colon that play a crucial role in the metabolism of lactose, vitamin synthesis, and immune system modulation. E. coli forms a biofilm on the epithelial cell surface of the intestine that can be modified by diet compounds, i.e., gluten, xylitol, lactose, and probiotics. METHODS: In the present study, the impact of probiotic-derived Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG strain on non-pathogenic E. coli biofilm was examined. The mono- and multispecies biofilm was also treated with gluten, xylitol, and lactose. We used 96-well plates to obtain biofilm growth. Biofilm was stained using crystal violet. To evaluate the type of interaction in mono- and multispecies biofilm, a new formula was introduced: biofilm interaction ratio index (BIRI). To describe the impact of nutrients on biofilm formation, the biofilm formation impact ratio (BFIR) was calculated. RESULTS: The biofilms formed by both examined species are stronger than in monocultures. All the BIRI values were above 3.0. It was found that the monospecies biofilm of L. rhamnosus is strongly inhibited by gluten (84.5%) and the monospecies biofilm of E. coli by xylitol (85.5%). The mixed biofilm is inhibited by lactose (78.8%) and gluten (90.6%). CONCLUSION: The relations between bacteria in the mixed biofilm led to changes in biofilm formation by E. coli and L. rhamnosus GG. Probiotics might be helpful in rebuilding the gut microbiota after broad spectrum antibiotic therapy, but only if gluten and lactose are excluded from diet.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic immuno-mediated enteropathy caused by dietary gluten in genetically susceptible individuals carrying HLA (Human Leukocytes Antigen) genes that encode for DQ2.5 and DQ8 molecules. TRAFD1 (TRAF-type zinc finger domain 1) is a gene recently found associated with CD and defined as a master regulator of IFNγ signalling and of MHC class I antigen processing/presentation. There is no specific drug therapy and the only effective treatment is the gluten-free diet (GFD). The great majority of celiac patients when compliant with GFD have a complete remission of symptoms and recovery of gut mucosa architecture and function. Until now, very few studies have investigated molecular differences occurring in CD patients upon the GFD therapy. METHODS: We looked at the expression of both HLA DQ2.5 and TRAFD1 risk genes in adult patients with acute CD at the time of and in treated patients on GFD. Specifically, we measured by qPCR the HLA-DQ2.5 and TRAFD1 mRNAs on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from the two groups of patients. RESULTS: When we compared the HLA-DQ mRNA expression, we didn't find significant variation between the two groups of patients, thus indicating that GFD patients have the same capability to present gliadin antigens to cognate T cells as patients with active disease. Conversely, TRAFD1 was more expressed in PBMC from treated CD subjects. Notably, TRAFD1 transcripts significantly increased in the patients analyzed longitudinally during the GFD, indicating a role in the downregulation of gluten-induced inflammatory pathways. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that HLA-DQ2.5 and TRAFD1 molecules are two important mediators of anti-gluten immune response and inflammatory process."

Next-generation sequencing was used to amplify the 16S rRNA gene of bacteria and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of fungi. The GFD increased Chao1 fungal diversity after the intervention, while the fungal composition showed no changes. Bacterial diversity and composition remained stable, but a positive association between bacterial and fungal Chao1 diversity and a negative association between Dothideomycetes and Akkermansia were observed.

      "abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals, affecting 1.4% of the world population. CD induces an inflammatory reaction that compromises small intestine villi, leading to nutrient malabsorption, and gastro and extraintestinal manifestations. Although other treatment approaches are being studied, adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only effective intervention to date. Despite this, about 50% of patients experience persistent inflammation, often associated with unintentional gluten ingestion through contaminated food. There are regulations for labeling gluten-free foods which specify a limit of 20 mg/kg (20 ppm). The risks of gluten cross-contamination above that level are present throughout the whole food production chain, emphasizing the need for caution. This review explores studies that tested different procedures regarding the shared production of gluten-containing and gluten-free food, including the use of shared equipment and utensils. A literature review covering PubMed, Scielo, Web of Science, VHL and Scopus identified five relevant studies. The results indicate that shared environments and equipment may not significantly increase gluten cross-contamination if appropriate protocols are followed. Simultaneous cooking of gluten-containing and gluten-free pizzas in shared ovens has demonstrated a low risk of contamination. In general, shared kitchen utensils and equipment (spoon, ladle, colander, knife, fryer, toaster) in controlled experiments did not lead to significant contamination of samples. On the other hand, cooking gluten-free and gluten-containing pasta in shared water resulted in gluten levels above the established limit of 20 ppm. However, rinsing the pasta under running water for a few seconds was enough to reduce the gluten content of the samples to less than 20 ppm.",

      "abstract": "Gluten hypersensitivity is characterized by the production of IgE antibodies against specific wheat proteins (allergens) and a myriad of clinical allergic symptoms including life-threatening anaphylaxis. Currently, the only recommended treatment for gluten hypersensitivity is the complete avoidance of gluten. There have been extensive efforts to develop dietary-based novel therapeutics for combating this disorder. There were four objectives for this study: (i) to compile the current understanding of the mechanism of gluten hypersensitivity; (ii) to critically evaluate the outcome from preclinical testing of novel therapeutics in animal models; (iii) to determine the potential of novel dietary-based therapeutic approaches under development in humans; and (iv) to synthesize the outcomes from these studies and identify the gaps in research to inform future translational research. We used Google Scholar and PubMed databases with appropriate keywords to retrieve published papers. All material was thoroughly checked to obtain the relevant data to address the objectives. Our findings collectively demonstrate that there are at least five promising dietary-based therapeutic approaches for mitigating gluten hypersensitivity in development. Of these, two have advanced to a limited human clinical trial, and the others are at the preclinical testing level. Further translational research is expected to offer novel dietary-based therapeutic options for patients with gluten hypersensitivity in the future.",

      "abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder that produces inflammation in the gut mucosa, affecting nutrient digestion and absorption. CD affects 0.3% to 1.0% of the world's population and only 15% have a clinical diagnosis. The only effective treatment is a gluten-free diet. The objective of this study was to develop a dough for gluten-free pasta prepared with mixtures of flours from corn, amaranth, soy, and rice. According to the FAO standard of 1975, the resultant mixtures should have a protein content greater than 11.0% and a chemical rating of not less than 70. Three mixtures were obtained: corn‒soy (81-19), corn‒rice‒soy (48-37-15), and corn‒rice‒amaranth (49-32-14). To improve the handling of the pasta and its physical characteristics (sedimentation, degree of absorption, and cracked shaped pasta) compared to a control (commercial) gluten-free pasta, carboxymethylcellulose, an emulsifier (distilled monoglycerides), and egg albumin were added at concentrations of 0.3, 0.5, and 5.0%, respectively. The corn flour was pregelatinized, and the extrusion was repeated twice. The experimental pasta had a protein content of 14.0%, which was higher than the commercial pasta (4.5%), and a gluten content of less than 20 mg/kg which, according to the Codex Alimentarius International Food Standard (2015), it is considered gluten-free. The corn‒rice‒soy pasta obtained had an acceptance and liking similar to a commercial brand. This pasta may widen the gluten-free products commercially available to CD patients in Mexico, which nowadays is limited and expensive. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Raw materials available in our country were selected to promote their consumption and diversify the ingredients used in the production of gluten-free products. The pasta obtained presented a higher nutritional content than a commercial gluten-free pasta and was comparable to that of a pasta made with wheat.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) mechanisms are well described, but the aetiology is uncertain. Coeliac disease (CD), a gluten enteropathy with increased duodenal eosinophils overlaps with GORD. Functional dyspepsia is a condition where duodenal eosinophilia is featured, and a 6-fold increased risk of incident GORD has been observed. Perturbations of the duodenum can alter proximal gastric and oesophageal motor function. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the association between CD and GORD. METHODS: A systematic search of studies reporting the association of GORD and CD was conducted. CD was defined by combined serological and histological parameters. GORD was defined based on classical symptoms, oesophagitis (endoscopic or histologic) or abnormal 24-h pH monitoring; studies reporting oesophageal motility abnormalities linked with GORD were also included. Pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random-effects model. FINDINGS: 31 papers were included. Individuals with CD on a gluten containing diet were 3 times more likely to have GORD than controls (OR: 3.37, 95% CI: 2.09-5.44), and over 10 times more likely when compared to those on a gluten free diet (GFD) (OR: 10.20, 95% CI: 6.49-16.04). Endoscopic oesophagitis was significantly associated with CD (OR: 4.96; 95% CI: 2.22-11.06). One year of a GFD in CD and GORD was more efficacious in preventing GORD symptom relapse than treatment with 8 weeks of PPI in non-CD GORD patients (OR: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.08-0.36). Paediatric CD patients were more likely to develop GORD (OR: 3.29, 95% CI: 1.46-7.43), compared to adult CD patients (OR: 2.55, 95% CI: 1.65-3.93). INTERPRETATION: CD is strongly associated with GORD but there was high heterogeneity. More convincingly, a GFD substantially improves GORD symptoms, suggesting a role for duodenal inflammation and dietary antigens in the aetiology of a subset with GORD. Ruling out CD in patients with GORD may be beneficial. FUNDING: The study was supported by an Investigator Grant from the NHMRC to Dr. Talley."

Current treatment consists of strict adherence to a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) which is considered safe and effective in the large majority of patients. However, since adherence to a GFD is difficult and has a negative impact on quality of life, an increasing interest in other treatment options has emerged. Moreover, in some individuals a GFD is not sufficiently effective, necessitating alternative treatments. METHODS: By performing a systematic search, we constructed a detailed narrative review. Only treatment options considered relevant and conducted in a phase I, II or III clinical trial were included. RESULTS: Based on the pathophysiology of CD, four major therapeutic approaches can be distinguished: firstly, by focusing on intraluminal gluten detoxification before absorption occurs, secondly, by modulating intestinal permeability and preventing paracellular uptake, thirdly, by enhancing immunological tolerance to gluten and finally, by regulating gluten auto-immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant efforts, no treatment has yet completed a phase III clinical trial. Future studies will likely focus on the use of supplemental drugs in conjunction to a GFD, with ALV003 and ZED-1227 currently being the most promising therapeutic options.",

      "abstract": "Gluten is a well-known food allergen globally, and it can induce immune responses in celiac- and nonceliac gluten-sensitive patients. The gliadin proteins from gluten have a special amino acid sequence that make it hydrophobic. One way to deal with gluten allergies is to provide a gluten-free diet. The hydrophobic characteristic of gliadin makes gliadin detection more difficult. An analyst needs to use an organic solvent or multiple processes to denature gluten for extraction. Although organic solvents can rapidly extract gluten in a sample, organic solvent also denatures the antibody and induces false biotest results without buffer dilute, and the accuracy will reduce with buffer dilute. An ionic liquid (IL) is a highly modifiable green chemical organic salt. The imidazolium has a cationic structure and is modified with different lengths (C = 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 12) of carbon side chains with organic and inorganic anions [methanesulfonate (MSO), Cl-, F-, NO3-, HSO4-, and H2PO4-] to make different kinds of ILs for testing the solubility of gliadin. Different IL/water ratios were used to test the solubility of gluten. We measured the solubility of gliadin in different imidazolium ILs, and the kinetic curve of gliadin dissolved in 1% [C5DMIM][MSO]aq was conducted. We also used circular dichroism spectroscopy and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure the gliadin structure and the effect of binding with an antibody after 1% [C5DMIM][MSO]aq treatment. An 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4- nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) assay was used to test the toxicity of [C5DMIM][MSO]aq in N2a cells. In our research, 1% [C5DMIM][MSO]aq produced a good solubility of gluten, and it could dissolve more than 3000 ppm of gluten in 5 min. [C5DMIM][MSO]aq did not break down the gluten structure and did not restrict antibody binding to gluten, and more importantly, [C5DMIM][MSO] did not exhibit cell toxicity. In this report, we showed that [C5DMIM][MSO] could be a good extraction solution applied for gluten detection."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The gluten-free diet (GFD) has limitations, and there is intense research in the development of adjuvant therapies. AIM: To examine the effects of orally administered Aspergillus niger prolyl endopeptidase protease (AN-PEP) on inadvertent gluten exposure and symptom prevention in adult celiac disease (CeD) patients following their usual GFD. METHODS: This was an exploratory, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled CeD patients on a long-term GFD. After a 4-wk run-in period, patients were randomized to 4 wk of two AN-PEP capsules (GliadinX; AVI Research, LLC, United States) at each of three meals per day or placebo. Outcome endpoints were: (1) Average weekly stool gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) between the run-in and end of treatments and between AN-PEP and placebo; (2) celiac symptom index (CSI); (3) CeD-specific serology; and (4) quality of life. Stool samples were collected for GIP testing by ELISA every Tuesday and Friday during run-ins and treatments. RESULTS: Forty patients were randomized for the intention-to-treat analysis, and three were excluded from the per-protocol assessment. Overall, 628/640 (98.1%) stool samples were collected. GIP was undetectable (< 0.08 μg/g) in 65.6% of samples, and no differences between treatment arms were detected. Only 0.5% of samples had GIP concentrations sufficiently high (> 0.32 μg/g) to potentially cause mucosal damage. Median GIP concentration in the AN-PEP arm was 44.7% lower than in the run-in period. One-third of patients exhibiting GIP > 0.08 μg/g during run-in had lower or undetectable GIP after AN-PEP treatment. Compared with the run- in period, the proportion of symptomatic patients (CSI > 38) in the AN-PEP arm was significantly lower (P < 0.03). AN-PEP did not result in changes in specific serologies. CONCLUSION: This exploratory study conducted in a real-life setting revealed high adherence to the GFD. The AN-PEP treatment did not significantly reduce the overall GIP stool concentration. However, given the observation of a significantly lower prevalence of patients with severe symptoms in the AN-PEP arm, further clinical research is warranted.",

      "abstract": "A lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only treatment for celiac disease and other gluten-related disorders. Nevertheless, strict adherence to the GFD is often challenging due to concerns about social isolation, risk of gluten contaminations, high cost, poor quality and the taste of gluten-free products. Moreover, although the GFD is effective in achieving mucosal healing, it may lead to dietary imbalances due to nutrient deficiencies over a long period of time. To overcome these issues, several gluten-free wheat flours have been developed to create products that closely resemble their gluten-containing counterparts. Furthermore, given the critical importance of adhering to the GFD, it becomes essential to promote adherence and monitor possible voluntary or involuntary transgressions. Various methods, including clinical assessment, questionnaires, serology for celiac disease, duodenal biopsies and the detection of Gluten Immunogenic Peptides (GIPs) are employed for this purpose, but none are considered entirely satisfactory. Since adherence to the GFD poses challenges, alternative therapies should be implemented in the coming years to improve treatment efficacy and the quality of life of patients with celiac disease. The aim of this narrative review is to explore current knowledge of the GFD and investigate its future perspectives, focusing on technology advancements, follow-up strategies and insights into a rapidly changing future.",

      "abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune enteropathy and multifactorial disease caused by inappropriate immune responses to gluten in the small intestine. Weight loss, anemia, osteoporosis, arthritis, and hepatitis are among the extraintestinal manifestations of active CD. Currently, a strict lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only safe, effective, and available treatment. Despite the social burden, high expenses, and challenges of following a GFD, 2 to 5 percent of patients do not demonstrate clinical or pathophysiological improvement. Therefore, we need novel and alternative therapeutic approaches for patients. Innovative approaches encompass a broad spectrum of strategies, including enzymatic degradation of gluten, inhibition of intestinal permeability, modulation of the immune response, inhibition of the transglutaminase 2 (TG2) enzyme, blocking antigen presentation by HLA-DQ2/8, and induction of tolerance. Hence, this review is focused on comprehensive therapeutic strategies ranging from dietary approaches to novel methods such as antigen-based immunotherapy, cell and gene therapy, and the usage of nanoparticles for CD treatment.",

      "abstract": "The only proven treatment for celiac disease is adherence to a strict, lifelong, gluten-free diet. However, complete dietary gluten avoidance is challenging and a substantial number of patients do not respond fully, clinically, or histologically, despite their best efforts. As celiac disease is common and its central pathophysiology is well elucidated, it has become attractive for drug development to address the limitations of dietary treatment. Most efforts address nonresponsive celiac disease, defined as continued symptoms and/or signs of disease activity despite a gluten-free diet, and the more severe forms of refractory celiac disease, types I and II. An increasing spectrum of therapeutic approaches target defined mechanisms in celiac disease pathogenesis and some have advanced to current phase 2 and 3 clinical studies. We discuss these approaches in terms of potential efficiency, practicability, safety, and need, as defined by patients, regulatory authorities, health care providers, and payors.",
