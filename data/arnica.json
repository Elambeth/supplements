      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In view of enhancing secondary metabolites biosynthesis in Arnica montana through elicitation, comprehensive studies are needed to fully understand the molecular background of biosynthetic pathways in this species. Analysis of transcriptional changes via RT-qPCR technique might shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying plant reaction to elicitors. This study aimed to identify reference genes which are stably expressed in Arnica under methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, and yeast extract treatment to provide the basis for current and future gene expression studies in this important medicinal plant. RESULTS: The expression stability of nine candidate reference genes was evaluated using four widely used algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and ΔCt method). A comprehensive analysis of the obtained results showed that the most stably expressed pair of genes under elicitation conditions was ATP-synthase and ACT. The PP2A and TUBb were the pair of least stable candidates as they presented substantial variation in transcript levels in response to elicitor agents. For validation purposes, the transcriptional profile of PAL, 4CL and HQT genes was analyzed. Substantial induction of two of these biosynthetic genes was confirmed after methyl jasmonate treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The ATP-synthase in combination with ACT were identified as the best endogenous controls for RT-qPCR data normalization in elicitation studies of A. montana. The research outcomes shed light on transcriptional changes associated with arnica's response to elicitation and contribute to the understanding of secondary metabolism regulation in medicinal plants.",

      "abstract": "Arnica montana (AM), which belongs to the daisy family Asteraceae, has a longstanding traditional use in Europe and North America for pain and inflammation treatment. This study investigates the inhibitory effects of 'Arnica montana extract hydrogel patch (AHP)' on Carrageenan-induced paw edema and hot plate-induced pain models. AHP exhibited transdermal permeability without the occurrence of issues like crystal precipitation. This study employed two animal model assessments using AHP, in comparison with Arnicare Gel (AG), to evaluate anti-inflammatory and pain relief effects. AHP treatment for 2 days showed a decrease in paw edema thickness in mice as compared to vehicle or AG groups; Carrageenan-induced swelling increased maximally at 1 h with the AHP group demonstrating a higher reduction. Thus, the AHP group exhibited a lower ratio of right/left paw thickness and a superior reduction in swelling, supportive of its ability to diminish edema. A histological analysis showed that AHP treatment reduced inflammatory cell infiltration. Consistently, the mRNA levels of inflammatory markers (tnfa, il1b, and il6) were decreased to a greater extent than the AG group. Particularly, tnfa inhibition was better in the AHP group, and the levels of il1b and il6 transcripts showed ~80% and 40% lower. Likewise, AHP reduced pain scores in a hot plate-induced rat model, although AG failed to do so. Together, these results demonstrate that AHP has long-lasting inhibitory effects on fluid effusion and edema formation, the production of inflammatory mediators, and pain-sensation, supporting its anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving pharmacological effects."

PURPOSE: Topical agents can modulate inflammatory processes. The aim of the present study was to determine if topical application of arnica or mucopolysaccharide polysulfate (MPSP) reduces pain, trismus, and edema following the removal of impacted mandibular third molars. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single center randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted. The patients were randomized into three groups: the control group (standard therapy [ST]: antibiotic + nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs twice a day), the arnica group (arnica + ST), and the MPSP group (MPSP + ST). The patients' pain, trismus, and edema values were measured preoperatively and on postoperative days 1, 3, 5, and 10. Sex, age, and operation time were also included. Analyses included descriptive statistics, analysis of variance, post hoc tests, and determinations of intraclass correlation coefficients. Statistical significance was set at P < .05. RESULTS: Sixty patients with a mean age of 26.98 ± 10.88 years were included in the study; 55% were females and 45% were males. The mean operation time was 23.8 ± 3.27 minutes. According to the visual analogue scale scores (in centimeter units), the arnica and MPSP groups felt less pain than the control group until day 5 (0.6 ± 0.88, 3.75 ± 1.16, 4.75 ± 1.29, and 1.05 ± 1.10, respectively, for the arnica group; 0.35 ± 0.59, 3.25 ± 1.62, 5.0 ± 1.65, and 1.50 ± 1.32 for the MPSP group; and 1.30 ± 1.17, 5.75 ± 1.37, 7.05 ± 1.10, and 3.15 ± 1.53 for the control group; P < .05). The trismus was lower on days 1, 3, and 5 in the arnica group (-8.05 ± 2.82, -12.15 ± 3.1, and -2.15 ± 1.81, respectively) than in the control group (-12 ± 3.82, -15.65 ± 4.81, and -4±2.81, respectively) (P < .05). The edema was lower on days 1 and 3 in the MPSP group (0.95 ± 2.2 and 1.75 ± 3.7, respectively) than in the control group (2.45 ± 0.9 and 3.6 ± 0.8, respectively) (P < .05). Arnica and MPSP had similar pain-relieving action, but arnica was more effective at reducing trismus, while MPSP was more effective at reducing edema. CONCLUSIONS: Topical application of arnica or MPSP may have a beneficial effect on relieving pain 5 days after surgery, but arnica was also effective at reducing trismus, while MPSP was also effective at reducing edema. Both arnica and MPSP reduced postoperative sequelae.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lychnophora ericoides Mart, also known as the Brazilian arnica or fake arnica, belongs to the Asteraceae family. Leaves and roots are used in alcoholic and hydroalcoholic preparations for the treatment of wounds, inflammation, and pain. PURPOSE: The present study aimed to investigate the effects of L. ericoides ethanolic extract (EELE) on cutaneous wound healing and the mechanisms of action involved. METHODS: A total of 72 C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into four groups of six animals each. An excisional wound was made in the dorsal region of each mouse. The test groups were topically treated with the vehicle, a positive control commercial reference drug, EELE ointment (5%), and EELE ointment (10%). The treatments were applied over 14 days. The wound area was measured every two days to verify the wound closure kinetics. On days 3, 7, and 14 the wound tissue samples were processed for Hematoxylin and Eosin, Masson-Trichrome, and Toluidine blue staining. The expression of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components, the vascular growth factor-A (VEGF-A), the basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), and type I collagen genes were evaluated. Phytochemical analyses were performed using HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS/MS. RESULTS: The EELE (10%) significantly reduced the wound area compared to the treatments used for the other groups. Histological analysis demonstrated that wounds treated with L. ericoides for 14 days developed improved anatomical skin features, healed with hair follicles and sebaceous glands, increased collagen production and angiogenesis, and decreased the number of mast cells at the injury site. Real-time PCR data demonstrated that groups treated with EELE (10%) showed increased Type I collagen, VEGF-A, FGF-2, and AT1R and decreased ACE II and receptor MAS. The healing action of L. ericoides may be related to the presence of phenolic compounds, such as phenolic acids, chlorogenic acid derivatives, and C-glycoside flavonoids. CONCLUSION: Topical treatment with EELE increases important factors for wound healing: FGF, VEGF, collagen formation, and the expression of the proliferative axis of the renin-angiotensin system. For the first time, the present study shows the healing action of L. ericoides at the molecular level in an animal model. This process can be used as an alternative therapy for wound healing and the development of herbal therapy.",

An experimental rat incisional skin lesion was used for the study. This involved making an incisional lesion on the dorsum of the animals using a scalpel. Ninety-six animals were used divided into the following groups: control (C), microcurrent (MC); topical treatment with Arnica montana gel (ARN); the ARN + microcurrent (ARN + MC). Treatments were administered daily, and injured tissue samples were collected and processed on Days 2, 6 and 10 for dermis analyses. Myeloperoxidase levels were greater in control than in treatment groups on Days 2 and 6. F4/80 expression was similar among all treatment groups and greater than that in control on Day 2. On Day 6, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor was higher in the MC group than that in other groups, whereas transforming growth factor-β expression increased in the MC and ARN + MC groups on Day 10. The expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 was higher in the ARN + MC group when compared with other groups on Day 10. Expression levels of collagen I were increased in the ARN and ARN + MC groups when compared with control and MC groups on Day 6, while expression of collagen III was enhanced in MC, ARN, and ARN + MC groups when compared with the control. The protocol combining microcurrent with topical application of ARN reduces the inflammatory process, increases myofibroblasts proliferation and decreases the presence of macrophages in the dermis during skin repair in rats.",

      "abstract": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is classified as a neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organization. As the standard drugs for the treatment of this disease suffer from severe unwanted effects, new effective and safe therapeutic options are required. In our previous work, Arnica tincture showed promising antileishmanial effects in vitro and in vivo. For the potential treatment of human CL patients with Arnica tincture, data on the pharmacokinetic properties of the bioactive, antileishmanial compounds (the sesquiterpene lactone (STL) helenalin and its derivatives) are needed. Therefore, we studied the in vivo absorption of the bioactive compounds after the dermal application of Arnica tincture in rats. Moreover, we analyzed the blood plasma, urine, and feces of the animals by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS). Although the majority (84%) of the applied STLs (1.0 mg) were absorbed, the concentrations in the plasma, urine, and feces were below the limit of detection (0.3 ng/mL) in the samples for UHPLC-HRMS analysis. This result may be explained by extensive metabolism and slow permeation accompanied by the accumulation of STLs in the skin, as described in our previous work. Accordingly, the plasma concentration of STLs after the topical application of Arnica tincture was very far from a dose where toxicity could be expected. Additionally, tests for corrosive or irritant activity as well as acute and repeated-dose dermal toxicity did not show any positive results after the administration of the amounts of Arnica tincture that would be needed for the treatment of CL. Consequently, in the treatment of CL patients with Arnica tincture, no toxic effects are expected, other than the known sensitization potential of the STLs."

METHODS: 52 pediatric patients (aged 9 to 14 years) with signs and symptoms of dry eyes and allergic conjunctivitis were included in the study. Twenty-six patients were assigned to the Hyaluronic Acid 0.2%/ Arnica extract 0.1% group (Study Group) while 26 patients to the Hyaluronic Acid 0.2% group (Control Group). Clinical signs and symptoms were assessed at baseline and at week 4. The assessment plan included: slit-lamp examination, tear film break up time (TBUT), Schirmer's test and conjunctival hyperemia score. Ocular surface disease index (OSDI) score was used to evaluate subjective symptoms of dry eye disease. RESULTS: Both treatment groups showed improvements in the estimated clinical parameters after treatment. OSDI score was significantly lower in both treatment groups (Study group p = 0.02; Control group p = 0.04) at the end of the follow up period. Improvements in TBUT, Schirmer's test results and conjunctival hyperemia were statistically significant only in the Study group (p = 0.021; p = 0.03; p < 0.01 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings suggest that combined topical Hyaluronic Acid 0.2% and arnica extract 0.1% can be effective in reducing symptoms and signs of dry eye disease in children."

      "abstract": "Leishmaniasis may occur in three different clinical forms, namely, visceral, mucocutaneous and cutaneous, which are caused by different species of trypanosomatid protozoans of the genus Leishmania. Pentavalent antimonials are the leading treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis despite the hepatic, renal, and cardiac toxicity. In addition, the response of some Leishmania species to pentavalent antimonials is increasingly poorer, and therefore new and more potent therapeutic alternatives are needed. Arnica montana L., Asteraceae, is a traditional medicinal plant of Europe and preparations of its flowers are commonly used externally to treat disorders of the musculoskeletal system as well as superficial inflammatory conditions. Previous studies have shown that Arnica tincture (AT), an ethanolic extract prepared from the flowerheads of Arnica montana as well as isolated Arnica sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) have antileishmanial activity in vitro against L. donovani and L. infantum, as well as in vivo against L. braziliensis. In this work, we studied the in vitro cytotoxicity and antileishmanial activity of AT and STLs against both L. braziliensis and L. tropica. The in vivo therapeutic effect of AT was studied in hamsters with cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) caused by experimental infection with L. braziliensis and L. tropica. Furthermore, various semisolid Arnica preparations were also evaluated against L. braziliensis. The STLs and the AT possess a very high in vitro activity against both Leishmania species with median effective concentrations (EC50) ranging from 1.9 to 5.9 μg/mL. The AT was not cytotoxic for human tissue macrophages, skin fibroblasts, and hepatic cells. The therapeutic response of hamsters infected with L. braziliensis to the topical treatment with AT was 87.5% at a dose of 19.2 μg STL/2× day/60 d, 72.7% at doses of 19.2 μg STL/1× d/60 d and 67% at a dose of 38.4 μg STL/2× d/60 d. In turn, the therapeutic response in hamsters infected with L. tropica was 100% when treated at a dose of 19.2 μg STL/2× day/60 d and 71% at a dose of 38.4 μg STL/2× d/60 d. On the other hand, the effectiveness of treatment with glucantime administered intralesionally at a dose of 200 mg/every three days for 30 days was 62.5% for L. braziliensis and 37.5% for L. tropica infection. These results are promising and encourage the implementation of clinical trials with AT in CL patients as a first step to using AT as a drug against CL."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. Use of homeopathic medicines for the treatment of cancers has increased in the last several years. Arnica montana is an anti-inflammatory homeopathic medicine used in traumatic conditions and because of this property we performed investigations for its potential as a chemotherapeutic agent against breast cancer. METHODS: An ethanolic extract of Arnica montana (mother tincture, MT), prepared according to the Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia of India, was characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), followed by computational (in silico) analysis using molecular docking, to identify specific compounds that can bind and modulate the activity of key proteins involved in breast cancer survival and progression. To validate the in silico findings, in a controlled experiment breast cancer cells (MCF7) were treated in vitro with Arnica montana and the cytotoxic effects assessed by flowcytometry, fluorescence microscopy, scratch assay, clonogenic potential and gene expression analysis. RESULTS: Phytochemical characterization of ethanolic extract of Arn MT by GC-MS allowed identification of several compounds. Caryophyllene oxide and 7-hydroxycadalene were selected for molecular docking studies, based on their potential drug-like properties. These compounds displayed selective binding affinity to some of the recognized target proteins of breast cancer, which included estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), progesterone receptor (PR), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) and E-cadherin. In vitro studies revealed induction of apoptosis in MCF7 cells following treatment with Arn MT. Furthermore, treatment with Arn MT revealed its ability to inhibit migration and colony forming abilities of the cancer cells. CONCLUSION: Considering the apoptotic and anti-migratory effects of Arnica montana in breast cancer cells in vitro, there is a need for this medicine to be further validated in an in vivo model.",

      "abstract": "Arnica tincture is a traditional herbal medicine used to treat blunt injuries, e.g., bruises and squeezes. In addition, a potential new use in the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis is currently under investigation. Therefore, detailed information about the dermal absorption of the tincture and especially its bioactive constituents, sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) of the helenalin- and 11α,13-dihydrohelenalin type, is mandatory. Consequently, this article reports on dermal absorption studies of Arnica tincture using diffusion cells and porcine skin as well as two human skin samples with different permeability. The amounts of STLs on the skin surfaces, in skin extracts and in the receptor fluids were quantified by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS). It was found that Arnica STLs permeated into the receptor fluid already 4 h after the application, but the amount was rather low. Within 48 h, a maximum of 8.4%, 14.6% and 36.4% of STLs permeated through porcine skin, human skin A (trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) = 11.518 g·m-2·h-1) and the more permeable human skin B (TEWL = 17.271 g·m-2·h-1), respectively. The majority of STLs was absorbed (penetrated into the skin; 97.6%, 97.8% and 99.3%) after 48 h but a huge portion could not be extracted from skin and is expected to be irreversibly bound to skin proteins. To better visualize the analytes in different skin layers, a fluorescence-labeled STL, helenalin 3,4-dimethoxycinnamate, was synthesized. Fluorescence microscopic images depict an accumulation of the fluorescent derivative in the epidermis. For the treatment of local, cutaneous complaints, an enrichment of the bioactive substances in the skin may be considered beneficial."

      "abstract": "Arnica tincture is a herbal medicinal preparation with anti-inflammatory activity which is used traditionally for the topical treatment of blunt injuries as well as rheumatic muscle and joint complaints. Its main bioactive constituents are sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) of the helenalin and 11α,13-dihydrohelenalin types. Besides the mentioned activity, the tincture and its isolated STLs have antileishmanial activity. In a recent in vivo study, a treatment with Arnica tincture cured cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) in a golden hamster model. CL is a neglected tropical disease affecting more than two million people every year, for which new treatments are urgently needed. In order to use Arnica tincture on open CL lesions of human patients, it is important to know how the constituents are metabolized. Therefore, in vitro metabolism experiments with liver microsomes of different species (rat, pig and human) were performed with the Arnica STLs helenalin acetate and 11α,13-dihydrohelenalin acetate. Phase I and phase II metabolism experiments were performed, as well as a combination of both. Glutathione conjugation plays a major role in the metabolism of these STLs, as could be expected based on previous reports on their reactivity. Besides glutathione conjugates, several other metabolites were formed, e.g., water conjugates and hydroxides. Our results show for the first time a detailed picture of the metabolism of Arnica STLs. The fast and extensive formation of glutathione conjugates makes it unlikely that low absorbed levels of these compounds, as expected after dermal absorption from Arnica tincture, could be of toxicological concern."

Our aim was to perform a metaanalysis of clinical trials to assess efficacy of Arnica montana to reduce the inflammatory response after surgery. Method: We conducted a systematic review and metaanalysis, following a predefined protocol, of all studies on the use of homeopathic Arnica montana in surgery. We included all randomized and nonrandomized studies comparing homeopathic Arnica to a placebo or to another active comparator and calculated two quantitative metaanalyses and appropriate sensitivity analyses. We used \"Hegde's g,\" an effect size estimator which is equivalent to a standardized mean difference corrected for small sample bias. The PROSPERO registration number is CRD42020131300. Results: Twenty-three publications reported on 29 different comparisons. One study had to be excluded because no data could be extracted, leaving 28 comparisons. Eighteen comparisons used placebo, nine comparisons an active control, and in one case Arnica was compared to no treatment. The metaanalysis of the placebo-controlled trials yielded an overall effect size of Hedge's g = 0.18 (95% confidence interval -0.007/0.373; p = 0.059). Active comparator trials yielded a highly heterogeneous significant effect size of g = 0.26. This is mainly due to the large effect size of nonrandomized studies, which converges against zero in the randomized trials. Conclusion: Homeopathic Arnica has a small effect size over and against placebo in preventing excessive hematoma and other sequelae of surgeries. The effect is comparable to that of anti-inflammatory substances."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ovariohysterectomy (OH) is one of the most frequent elective surgical procedures in routine veterinary practice. Arnica montana is a well-known medicine in phytotherapy, with proven analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, healing, antioxidant and immunomodulatory activity. However, there is still a shortage of studies on the action and effects of the homeopathic formulation of the medicine on animals. The aim of this study was to evaluate analgesia with Arnica montana 30cH during the postoperative period after elective OH. METHODS: Thirty healthy female dogs, aged 1 to 3 years, weighing 7 to 14 kg, were selected at the Veterinary Hospital in Campo Mourão, Paraná, Brazil. The dogs underwent the surgical procedure with an anaesthetic protocol and analgesia that had the aim of maintaining the patient's wellbeing. After the procedure, they were randomly divided into three groups of 10. One group received Arnica montana 30cH; another received 5% hydroalcoholic solution; and the third group, 0.9% NaCl saline solution. All animals received four drops of the respective solution sublingually and under blinded conditions, every 10 minutes for 1 hour, after the inhalational anaesthetic had been withdrawn. The Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale was used to analyse the effect of therapy. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey test was used to evaluate the test data. Statistical differences were deemed significant when p ≤0.05. RESULTS: The Arnica montana 30cH group maintained analgesia on average for 17.8 ± 3.6 hours, whilst the hydroalcoholic solution group did so for 5.1 ± 1.2 hours and the saline solution group for 4.1 ± 0.9 hours (p ≤0.05). CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that Arnica montana 30cH presented a more significant analgesic effect than the control groups, thus indicating its potential for postoperative analgesia in dogs undergoing OH.",

In the absence of HS (experiment 1), the addition of Arnica montana to the IVM medium had a deleterious effect on the IVEP (cleavage and blastocyst rates) and the total cell number/blastocysts. On the other hand, ethanol (0.3%) increased IVEP in relation to the Control and Arnica montana treatments. However, in the presence of HS during IVM (experiment 2), the addition of ethanol or Arnica montana increased IVEP when compared to the HS treatment alone, and the Arnica montana treatment resulted in greater total cell number/blastocysts compared to the other treatments. In conclusion, this study showed for the first time that the negative or positive effect of Arnica montana 6 cH on IVEP depends on the culture condition (i.e., absence or presence of HS during IVM). On the other hand, ethanol showed beneficial and consistent results on IVEP regardless of exposure to HS.",

      "abstract": "Background: ultraviolet radiation types A and B (UV) (400-315nm and 315-280nm respectively) are the main components present in sunlight known to cause skin injuries. Arnica montana is a plant that has been widely studied for containing anti-inflammatory, healing and analgesic properties capable of preventing or ameliorating lesions. Here, we investigated the therapeutic effect of topical application of Arnica montana after UVB-induced cutaneous injuries in mice.Methods: mice were exposed to UVB radiation (Philips TL40W/12 RS lamp) in a period of 3 hours. After one hour of radiation exposure, the animals were treated with topical application of Arnica montana ointment (250 mg/g) in the ear. At the time of 16 hours after treatment, the parameters of edema, oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction were measured in the ear of mice.Results: our results demonstrated that topical treatment with Arnica montana reduced the UVB-induced inflammatory response as demonstrated by the reduction of ear edema, inhibition of myeloperoxidase activation, decrease of nuclear factor kappa B levels and reduction of proinflammatory cytokines levels, such as interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma. In addition, Arnica montana ameliorated oxidative damage mediated by UVB radiation, as demonstrated by the reduction of lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and increase of tissue antioxidant capacity and glutathione levels in the ear.Conclusion: we concluded that Arnica montana ointment is effective in alleviating the auricular inflammatory process and oxidative damage induced by acute UVB radiation, sustaining the traditional use of Arnica montana for the treatment of skin disorders.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Arnica and bromelain, two of the most widely recommended homeopathic medications to improve perioperative outcomes, have yet to be widely adopted by allopathic practitioners. A significant barrier to utilization of herbal medications by allopathic doctors is that the preparations and dosing regimens are not widely known or understood. The goal of this review was to critically analyze studies that have examined the perioperative efficacy of arnica and bromelain with a focus on treatment regimen and outcomes. METHODS: A triple database search was conducted with the keywords \"arnica,\" \"bromelain,\" and \"surgery.\" References for each identified article were analyzed for additional articles. Articles were analyzed for methodology, outcomes, and conclusion. Articles were excluded if they did not involve human subjects, were published before 1990, and if they were not available in English. Level of evidence was determined based on methodology. RESULTS: A total of 29 articles met inclusion criteria, with 20 and 9 in the arnica and bromelain treatment groups, respectively. There was marked heterogeneity with regard to surgical procedure, dosing regimen, outcomes measured, and results. Arnica seems to have a mitigating effect on ecchymosis, most notably following rhinoplasty and facelifts/facial procedures. Bromelain is well supported across numerous studies in reducing trismus, pain, and swelling following molar extractions. However, there was no effect demonstrated when evaluating topical arnica following blepharoplasty procedures. DISCUSSION: A systematic review of the literature demonstrates the potential for arnica and bromelain to improve perioperative outcomes including edema, ecchymosis, and pain control. Future studies are required to determine safety and efficacy of dosing and interactions with other medications. We hope this article stimulates surgeons to consider using these interventions to improve perioperative outcomes in the context of well-done studies with an objective analysis of results.",

      "abstract": "Mountain arnica Arnica montana L. is a source of several metabolite classes with diverse biological activities. The chemical composition of essential oil and its major volatile components in arnica may vary depending on the geographical region, environmental factors, and plant organ. The objective of this study was to characterize the chemical composition of essential oil derived from A. montana achenes and to investigate its effect on induction of apoptosis and autophagy in human anaplastic astrocytoma MOGGCCM and glioblastoma multiforme T98G cell lines. The chemical composition of essential oil extracted from the achenes was examined with the use of Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry GC-MS. Only 16 components of the essential oil obtained from the achenes of 3-year-old plants and 18 components in the essential oil obtained from the achenes of 4-year-old plants constituted ca. 94.14% and 96.38% of the total EO content, respectively. The main components in the EO from the arnica achenes were 2,5-dimethoxy-p-cymene (39.54 and 44.65%), cumene (13.24 and 10.71%), thymol methyl ether (8.66 and 8.63%), 2,6-diisopropylanisole (8.55 and 8.41%), decanal (7.31 and 6.28%), and 1,2,2,3-tetramethylcyclopent-3-enol (4.33 and 2.94%) in the 3- and 4-year-old plants, respectively. The essential oils were found to exert an anticancer effect by induction of cell death in anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme cells. The induction of apoptosis at a level of 25.7-32.7% facilitates the use of this secondary metabolite in further studies focused on the development of glioma therapy in the future. Probably, this component plays a key role in the anticancer activity against the MOGGCCM and T98G cell lines. The present study is the first report on the composition and anticancer activities of essential oil from A. montana achenes, and further studies are required to explore its potential for future medicinal purposes.",

Current treatments available are associated with multiple side effects and do not slow down the progression of the disease. Moreover, no such effective treatment is available to date in various systems of medicine to treat osteoarthritis. Curcumin and Arnica have shown evident clinical advances in the treatment of osteoarthritis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to design, optimize and characterize novel herbal transdermal patches of curcumin and Arnica montana using factorial design. METHODS: A multiple factorial design was employed to investigate the effect of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and jojoba oil on elongation and drug release. Transdermal patches were evaluated by FTIR, DSC, FESEM, ex vivo drug permeation, anti osteoarthritic activity and analgesic activity. RESULTS: Independent variables exhibited a significant effect on the physicochemical properties of the prepared formulations. The higher values of drug release and elongation were observed with the higher concentration of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and jojoba oil. Anti osteoarthritic activity was assessed by complete Freund's adjuvant arthritis model; using rats and analgesic activity by Eddy's hot plate method, using mice. Combination patch exhibited good anti osteoarthritic and analgesic activity as compare to individual drug patches. CONCLUSION: The design results revealed that the combination patch exhibited good physicochemical, anti osteoarthritic and analgesic activity for the treatment of osteoarthritis in animals. More plants and their combinations should be explored to get reliable, safe and effective formulations that can compete with synthetic drugs.",

The orthopedic evaluation of Shoulder Motion (SM) was also performed. The use of painkillers was reported as a number of doses needed. RESULTS: Age, gender distribution, Gartner type, main calcification size, baseline VAS (VAS-0) and degree of SM did not differ (p=NS) between Groups. After 3-day therapy, the reduction of pain in Group A (4.5±2.5) was superior to that observed in Group B (2.7±2.6) (p =0.03). The same result was observed in the improvement of SM in Group A (69.4±24.9) than in Group B (51.1±21.1) (p =0.015). No local or general adverse effects were noted. The number of doses of paracetamol was similar, but Group A patients used less ibuprofen (p =0.007). CONCLUSION: Local administration of the AC+AN+HL ointment mixture, which in our pilot study was superior to AC alone, could be safely suggested as an alternative uneventful treatment of patients with CPS.",

The animals were treated topically with a daily single dose of the preparation for 28 days. Subsequently, the healing process was monitored by recording the lesion size in intervals of 15 days up to day 90. As a result, Arnica tincture fully cured three out of five hamsters while one animal showed an improvement and another one suffered from a relapse. This result was slightly better than that obtained with the positive control, meglumine antimonate, which cured two of five hamsters while the other three showed a relapse after 90 days.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2012 to 2014, 53 women were randomly assigned to A. montana or placebo and were followed up for 5 days. The main end point was the reduction in blood and serum volumes collected in drainages. Secondary end points were duration of drainage, a self-evaluation of pain, and the presence of bruising or hematomas. RESULTS: The per-protocol analysis revealed a lower mean volume of blood and serum collected in drainages with A. montana (-94.40 ml; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 22.48-211.28; P = 0.11). A regression model including treatment, volume collected in the drainage on the day of surgery, and patient weight showed a statistically significant difference in favor of A. montana (-106.28 ml; 95% CI: 9.45-203.11; P = 0.03). Volumes collected on the day of surgery and the following days were significantly lower with A. montana at days 2 (P = 0.033) and 3 (P = 0.0223). Secondary end points have not revealed significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: A. montana 1000 K could reduce post-operative blood and seroma collection in women undergoing unilateral total mastectomy. Larger studies are needed with different dilutions of A. montana to further validate these data."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Heterotheca inuloides Cass. (Asteraceae) has been traditionally used to treat a wide range of diseases in Mexico in the treatment of rheumatism, topical skin inflammation, muscular pain colic, and other painful conditions associated with inflammatory processes, additionally has been used to treat dental diseases, and gastrointestinal disorders. This species has also been used for the treatment of cancer and diabetes. This review provides up-to-date information on the botanical characterization, traditional uses, chemical constituents, as well as the biolological activities of H. inuloides. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A literature search was conducted by analyzing the published scientific material. Information related to H. inuloides was collected from various primary information sources, including books, published articles in peer-reviewed journals, monographs, theses and government survey reports. The electronic search of bibliographic information was gathered from accepted scientific databases such as Scienfinder, ISI Web of Science, Scielo, LILACS, Redalyc, Pubmed, SCOPUS and Google Scholar. RESULTS: To date, more than 140 compounds have been identified from H. inuloides, including cadinane sesquiterpenes, flavonoids, phytosterols, triterpenes, benzoic acid derivatives, and other types of compounds. Many biological properties associated with H. inuloides. Many studies have shown that the extracts and some compounds isolated from this plant exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities such as antioxidant, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic, and chelating activities, as well as insecticidal and phytotoxic activity. To date, reports on the toxicity of H. inuloides are limited. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive analysis of the literature obtained through the above-mentioned sources conﬁrmed that ethnomedical uses of H. inuloides have been recorded in Mexico to treat rheumatism, pain, and conditions associated with inflammatory processes. Pharmacological studies have demonstrated the activity of certain compounds associated with the traditional use of the plant such as the anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activities of the species. The available literature showed that cadinene sesquiterpenes are the major bioactive components of H. inuloides with potential pharmacological activities. Further investigations are needed to fully understand the mode of action of the major active constituents.",

Arnica plant is considered a potential candidate material with high antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Therefore, in this study, a locally available Heterotheca inuloides, also known as Mexican arnica, was analyzed for the extraction of high-value compounds. Based on different pressure (P), temperature (T), and co-solvent (CoS), four treatments (T) were prepared. A maximum 7.13% yield was recovered from T2 (T = 60 °C, P = 10 MPa, CoS = 8 g/min), followed by 6.69% from T4 (T = 60 °C, P = 30 MPa, CoS = 4 g/min). Some bioactive sesquiterpenoids such as 7-hydroxycadalene, caryophyllene and δ-cadinene were identified in the extracts by GC/MS. The fatty acid profile revealed that the main components were palmitic acid (C16:0), followed by linoleic acid (C18:2ω6c), α-linolenic acid (C18:3ω3) and stearic acid (C18:0) differing in percent yield per treatment. Antibacterial activities were determined by the agar diffusion method, indicating that all the treatments exerted strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, C. albicans, and E. coli strains. The antioxidant capacity of the extracts was also measured by three in vitro assays, DPPH, TEAC and FRAP, using Trolox as a standard. Results showed high antioxidant capacity enabling pharmaceutical applications of Mexican arnica.",

Despite a high incidence of arnica use among upper blepharoplasty patients, evidence to support its treatment effect is lacking. The authors performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of arnica ointment after upper blepharoplasty. METHODS: One hundred thirty-six bilateral upper blepharoplasty patients were randomized between arnica ointment 10% and placebo ointment. In both study arms, one periorbital area was designated as the treatment side (either arnica or placebo ointment), and the contralateral side served as an untreated (no ointment) internal control. As the primary endpoint, the overall periorbital appearance as based on light photography and judged by a medical and nonmedical panel, was assessed after 3 days, 7 days, and 6 weeks. Secondary endpoints were swelling, ecchymosis, erythema, pain, and patient satisfaction with recovery and outcome. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between arnica and placebo in overall judgment of periorbital appearance 3 days, 7 days, and 6 weeks after surgery. Furthermore, swelling, ecchymosis, erythema, pain, and patient satisfaction with recovery and outcome did not differ between arnica and placebo. Postoperative outcome in untreated eyelids was not different from eyelids treated with either arnica or placebo on any of the studied outcome measures. CONCLUSION: The authors' study demonstrates that topical arnica ointment after upper blepharoplasty does not improve postoperative outcome. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, II.",

Ecchymosis and edema are common temporary postprocedure unwanted effects. Two botanically-derived products, arnica and bromelain, are used internationally by physicians to limit ecchymosis and edema that occur secondary to cosmetic, laser, and surgical skin procedures. OBJECTIVE: The authors review the published literature and provide evidence-based recommendations on arnica and bromelain for prevention and treatment of postprocedure ecchymosis and edema. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A search of the computerized bibliographic databases Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, and CINAHL was performed on March 23, 2015. The key terms used were \"arnica,\" and \"bromelain.\" RESULTS: This review contains clinical trials that evaluated prevention and/or treatment of postprocedure ecchymosis or edema with oral arnica (11), topical arnica (2), and oral bromelain (7). No studies on topical bromelain were found. Clinical trials on arnica and bromelain have demonstrated mixed results. Some randomized controlled trials reported improvement postprocedure with arnica (4/13) and bromelain (5/7). CONCLUSION: Based upon published studies, there is insufficient data to support use of arnica and bromelain post procedure, and the authors recommend additional research to determine the efficacy and safety of arnica and bromelain to prevent and/or treat ecchymosis and edema in patients.",

The presence of inflammatory cells in atherosclerotic plaques of patients with stable coronary disease indicates the possibility to act by inhibiting the inflammatory phenomenon with Arnica comp.-Heel® tablets reducing the risk of instability of the plaque and, consequently, improving the clinical outcome in patients with stable coronary disease. METHODS: Within this retrospective observational spontaneous clinical study 44 patients (31 males and 13 females) all presenting stable coronary artery disease were evaluated; 25 subjects were treated with only acetylsalicylic acid and/or clopidogrel in association with statins (standard therapeutic protocol) while for the other 18 subjects the standard therapeutic protocol was integrated with Arnica comp.-Heel® (one sublingual tablet/day). The primary outcome was to evaluate the incidence of acute coronary syndrome, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, or non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke. RESULTS: The evaluation of the primary outcome showed that in the group of patients (18) who received the standard therapeutic protocol plus Arnica comp.-Heel® only one cardiovascular event was registered (5.6%) while in the group treated only with standard therapy 4 events were recorded in 25 patients (16%). CONCLUSIONS: The treatment with Arnica comp.-Heel® (one tablet/day) in combination with standard therapies for secondary prevention is effective in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary artery disease.",

METHOD: One hundred eight patients were included in the study. Participants were randomized into three groups, all of whom had undergone rhinoplasty. Group 1 (n = 36) received postoperative arnica cream treatment, and group 2 (n = 36) received postoperative mucopolysaccharide polysulfate cream treatment. Group 3 (n = 36, control group) consisted of patients who received no postoperative local treatments. Patients were evaluated for 24 hours on days 2, 5, 7, and 10 after the operation. For the evaluation of postoperative edema and ecchymosis, a scale ranging from 0 to 4 was used, and the groups were compared. RESULTS: In groups 1 and 2, postoperative ecchymosis was significantly less than in the control group during postoperative days 1, 5, and 7 (p < 0.005). The regression of the edema was also more rapid in groups 1 and 2 than in the control group during evaluations on postoperative days 1, 5, and 7 (p < 0.005). Neither edema nor ecchymosis was significantly different between groups 1 and 2 (p > 0.005).

Based on this, the gastroprotective activity of S. chilensis methanolic extract was investigated. Besides, a phytochemical study allowed isolation of two flavonoids (quercitrin and afzelin). The gastroprotective effects were investigated in acute gastric ulcer models, and the antisecretory activity was assessed in vivo and in vitro. The adhered mucus levels, reduced glutathione (GSH) content and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were quantified in ulcerated tissues. The contribution of isolated compounds in extract effects was evaluated, and its doses were calculated according to its yield. To evaluate the in vivo healing properties of S. chilensis methanolic extract, a chronic gastric ulcer was induced in mice by 10 % acetic acid. Evaluation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels was also performed at the site of the acetic acid-induced gastric ulcer. In parallel, effects on cell viability and cell proliferation of fibroblasts (L929 cells) were determined by in vitro trials. Firstly, the S. chilensis methanolic extract (100 or 300 mg/kg) reduced the ulcer area induced by ethanol/HCl in mice when compared to the vehicle group. Moreover, the S. chilensis extract (300 mg/kg) prevented the mucus depletion, the increase in MPO activity and the decrease in the GSH levels in the ulcerated gastric tissue. The S. chilensis extract also was able to decrease the indomethacin-induced gastric ulcer in rats at a dose of 100 mg/kg. The antisecretory effect of the extract (100 mg/kg, intraduodenal (i.d.)) was confirmed by the reduction in the volume and acidity in parallel to an increase in the pH of gastric content. In addition, quercitrin (1.38 mg/kg, but not 0.46 mg/kg) and afzelin (0.026 and 0.078 mg/kg) decreased the ethanol/HCl-induced gastric ulcer. In this model, quercitrin (1.38 mg/kg) prevented the depletion of gastric GSH content and both quercitrin (1.38 mg/kg) and afzelin (0.078 mg/kg) reduced the MPO activity. These compounds also inhibited the H(+),K(+)-ATPase activity at a concentration of 1-100 μg/ml. In addition, the participation of quercitrin and afzelin in these effects also was confirmed. Furthermore, after 4 days of the treatment, an oral administration of S. chilensis methanolic extract (100 mg/kg) reduced the area of the gastric ulcer induced by acetic acid and the regeneration of the gastric mucosa was accompanied by a reduction in gastric TNF levels. The healing properties of the extract also were confirmed by enhancement of proliferation and coverage of scratched wounds in a fibroblast monolayer. Together, our results confirmed the gastroprotective effect of S. chilensis methanolic extract as well as its gastric healing potential and provided some support to the traditional use of S. chilensis for prevention and treatment of gastric lesions in complementation to its known anti-inflammatory properties.",

OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we searched for HSP70-inducers from a library of herbal extracts that have already been approved as quasi-pharmaceutical products in Japan. We selected an ethanol extract of Arnica montana (A. montana), based on its high HSP70-inducing activity and low cytotoxicity. METHODS: Cell viability was determined by MTT method and expression of HPS70 was monitored by immunoblotting analysis. RESULTS: From the extract, we purified and identified eight sesquiterpene lactones (AM1-8) as HSP70-inducers, among which AM-2 (helenalin 2-methylbutyrate) was selected due to its good HSP70-inducing properties and low cytotoxicity. Treatment of cultured mouse melanoma cells with AM-2 or A. montana extract up-regulated the expression of HSP70 in a dose-dependent manner. This treatment also activated heat shock factor-1, a transcription factor for hsp genes. Furthermore, pre-treatment of cells with AM-2 or A. montana extract decreased melanin production and expression and activity of tyrosinase. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that AM-2 and A. montana extract could be beneficial for use in hypopigmenting cosmetics as a consequence of their stimulatory effects on HSP70 expression.",

      "abstract": "Arnica montana L. is a high altitude perennial plant, indigenous to Europe, but it is not native in the flora of Serbia. Plantain introduction of A. montana began a few years ago in the Tara mountain region, Western Serbia (43°53'44.17″N 19°33'11.62″E, 1,008 m ASL). The mountainous climate in this region is characterized by 850 mm of precipitation per year and an average decade temperature range from 11 to 25°C in the vegetation period of May through September. The main soil type is dystric cambisol, exhibiting a slightly acidic reaction (pH 6.4). Seeds of A. montana cv. ARBO were obtained from the Agricultural Research Centre of Finland. Seedlings were produced in a greenhouse during the period March through April and planted in May 2008. Virescence symptoms were observed starting from May 2010. A. montana exhibited symptoms mainly on flowers, like green leaflike structures instead of flowers and proliferation of acillary buds. Later in the season, flowers were malformed and consequently failed to produce seeds. Plant material for analyses was collected during 2010 and 2011 from an experimental field located at Tara mountain. Total DNA was extracted from the leaf midveins of 14 symptomatic and six symptomless plants (3). Nested PCR was carried out with primers P1/P7 followed by P1/16S-Sr and R16F2n/R16R2 primers, resulting with the DNA fragments amplification of expected size: 1.8, 1.5, and 1.2 kb, respectively, in all symptomatic samples tested. No phytoplasmas were detected in symptomless samples. PCR products of 1.2 kb, obtained by R16F2n/R16R2 primers from symptomatic samples, were digested independently with four restriction enzymes (Alu I, Tru I, Hpa II and Hha I) and the RFLP patterns were compared with those of Stolbur (Stol), Aster Yellows (AY), Flavescence Doree-C (FD-C), Poinsettia Branch-Inducing (PoiBI) and Clover Yellow Edge (CYE) phytoplasmas (2). RFLP patterns from all symptomatic A. montana samples were identical to CYE pattern. Comparison of the 16S rDNA sequence of representative symptomatic sample Am4, deposited under accession number JX297491 in NCBI GenBank, with other phytoplasmas from the database revealed 99% identity with members of 16SrIII-B phytoplasma group: Clover yellow edge phytoplasma strain CYE (JQ944798.1), 'Euscelidius variegatus' phytoplasma strain AP-I (HQ589197.1), Clover phyllody phytoplasma strain CP (HQ589196.1), etc. In Serbia, phytoplasma belonging 16SrIII-B subgroup has been identified in Cirsium arvense (4) and pear plants (1). To our knowledge, this is the first report of a natural infection of A. montana by phytoplasma. Cultivation of A. montana provides the necessary raw material for medicament production. The flower heads are widely used for the topical treatment of bruises and sprains in phytopharmaceutical preparations.Taking into consideration that monoculture plantation growing of perennials favorites rapid spreading of infections, the present study tended to examine the potential threat of virescence, which could be the limiting factor of ex-situ conservation of this endangered plant by its cultivation.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Arnica montana L. and Artemisia absinthium L. (Asteraceae) are medicinal plants native to temperate regions of Europe, including Romania, traditionally used for treatment of skin wounds, bruises and contusions. In the present study, A. montana and A. absinthium ethanolic extracts were evaluated for their chemical composition, antioxidant activity and protective effect against H2O2-induced oxidative stress in a mouse fibroblast-like NCTC cell line. RESULTS: A. absinthium extract showed a higher antioxidant capacity than A. montana extract as Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, Oxygen radical absorbance capacity and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical-scavenging activity, in correlation with its flavonoids and phenolic acids content. Both plant extracts had significant effects on the growth of NCTC cells in the range of 10-100 mg/L A. montana and 10-500 mg/L A. absinthium. They also protected fibroblast cells against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative damage, at the same doses. The best protection was observed in cell pre-treatment with 10 mg/L A. montana and 10-300 mg/L A. absinthium, respectively, as determined by Neutral red and lactate dehydrogenase assays. In addition, cell pre-treatment with plant extracts, at these concentrations, prevented morphological changes induced by hydrogen peroxide. Flow-cytometry analysis showed that pre-treatment with A. montana and A. absinthium extracts restored the proportion of cells in each phase of the cell cycle. CONCLUSIONS: A. montana and A. absinthium extracts, rich in flavonoids and phenolic acids, showed a good antioxidant activity and cytoprotective effect against oxidative damage in fibroblast-like cells. These results provide scientific support for the traditional use of A. montana and A. absinthium in treatment of skin disorders."

DESIGN: The animals were randomly divided into six groups: (1) no intervention (control group); (2) microcurrent application (10 μA/2 min); (3) topical application of gel containing H. perforatum; (4) topical application of H. perforatum gel and microcurrent (10 μA/2 min); (5) topical application of gel containing A. montana; (6) topical application of A. montana gel and microcurrent (10 μA/2 min). Tissue samples were obtained on the 2nd, 6th and 10th days after injury and submitted to structural and morphometric analysis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Differences in wound healing were observed between treatments when compared to the control group. Microcurrent application alone or combined with H. perforatum gel or A. montana gel exerted significant effects on wound healing in this experimental model in all of the study parameters (P<0.05) when compared to the control group with positive effects seen regarding newly formed tissue, number of newly formed blood vessels and percentage of mature collagen fibers. The morphometric data confirmed the structural findings. In conclusion, application of H. perforatum or A. montana was effective on experimental wound healing when compared to control, but significant differences in the parameters studied were only observed when these treatments were combined with microcurrent application.",

(Asteraceae) are used macerated in water or ethanol to treat inflammation, pain, rheumatism, contusions, bruises and insect bites in Brazilian traditional medicine. In this study, anti-inflammatory activity of ethanol extract from aerial parts of L. trichocarpha and its ethyl acetate fraction was investigated. Sesquiterpene lactones, lychnopholide (Lyc) and eremantholide C (EreC), isolated of ethyl acetate fraction, were also assayed for in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity. Topical treatment with ointments containing ethanol extract, its ethyl acetate fraction and sesquiterpene lactones significantly reduced carrageenan-induced mice paw oedema. In vitro assays demonstrated that Lyc inhibited interferon -γ/lipopolysaccharide -stimulated nitric oxide (NO) production in J774A.1 macrophages and increased production of IL-10 anti-inflammatory cytokine. The reduction of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production by EreC was accompanied by an increased production of IL-10 in a concentration-dependent manner in J774A.1 macrophages. The anti-inflammatory effect of Lyc seems to involve the inhibition of production of NO and increased production of IL-10. The mechanism of the effect of EreC on the reduction of carrageenan-induced paw oedema may be attributed to inhibition of production of TNF-α and stimulation of IL-10 production. The results corroborate the use of ethanol extract from Lychnophora trichocarpha in folk medicine for anti-inflammatory action and indicate that the topical route is suitable for use.",

A homeopathic arnica patch (3X dilution according to the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States) was developed to alleviate pain symptoms in the back and neck muscles and joints. CASE PRESENTATION: The present case report describes the treatment outcome after administration of the arnica patch in a 55-year-old female patient with pain in the right hand and numbness in the fourth finger after cellulitis in the palmar area. The cellulitis was treated with antibiotics, but pain symptoms remained at 7 points on a 0-to-10-point visual analog scale (VAS) for pain despite intake of oral ibuprofen and oral and topical application of an arnica-containing complex homeopathic ointment. Ten arnica patches were dispensed to the patient. She cut the patch into strips to cover all painful areas of the hand and applied them at night. After 3 days, she reported a substantial decrease in pain symptoms (VAS = 1) and a marked decrease in numbness and in the size of a tender nodule on the third metacarpal area. Moreover, the patient was able to sleep through the night without being awakened by the pain. The symptoms declined further during the next 2 days. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates that after a relatively short period of time, the administration of the arnica patch on the hand provided a marked reduction of pain and recovery of functionality of the hand."

METHODS: E. coli were cultured to their log phase in a standard Luria-Bertani medium and then exposed to sublethal doses of UV irradiation at 25 and 50 J/m(2) for 22.5 and 45 s, respectively. The UV-exposed bacteria were then supplemented with either AM-30C (drug) or placebo (P-30C). The drug-treated and placebo-treated bacteria were subjected to assay for DNA damage and oxidative stress 90 min after UV exposure. Several protocols like comet assay, gel electrophoresis for DNA ladder and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and biomarker measurement like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were conducted. The mRNA expressions of the excision repair genes like ultraviolet repair uvrA, B and C genes (or also known as excision repair genes) were estimated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method. RESULTS: The UV-exposed bacteria showed DNA damage and oxidative stress, as revealed by an increase in ROS generation, and a decrease in SOD, CAT and GSH activities. As compared to placebo, the AM-30C-treated bacteria showed less DNA damage and oxidative stress as manifested by a decrease in ROS generation, and an increase in SOD, CAT and GSH activities. AM-30C also up-regulated the expression of repair genes as compared to the control. CONCLUSION: AM-30C helped repair the DNA damage through up-regulation of repair genes and also ameliorated the oxidative stress through the reduction of ROS generation and suitable modulation of anti-oxidative stress enzymes.",

The medication was applied 4-5 times daily for 10 days. Efficacy was assessed on day 3-4 by evaluating pain on motion on a visual analogue scale (VAS). Pain improvement in group A was significantly superior over groups B-D (t-test with unadjusted baseline values, P < 4 × 10(-7) and ANCOVA after adjustment, P < 5 × 10(-11)) and approximately corresponded to the cumulative effect of the single constituents (12.1, 7.5, and 18.7 mm VAS for A versus B, A versus C, and A versus D; 95% CI 8.0-16.2, 4.7-10.4, and 14.8-22.5 mm). The combination is justified by the additive effects of the single active constituents."

Because clinical investigations are lacking we wanted to investigate its efficacy in partial thickness burns. METHODS: Two individuals performed a self experiment: 4 experimental grade 2 burns (each 1 cm(2)) on the back were induced respectively with an erbium YAG-laser. Wounds were treated with Combudoron gel, Combudoron liquid, placebo gel or placebo liquid in each of the subjects in a standardized, single blind manner. Outcome parameters were the photo documented duration of wound healing and visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores. RESULTS: All 8 experimental burns were similar from size and depth at baseline. Eschars of the verum-treated burns fell off earlier than the placebo-treated burns (verum liquid: after 14 and 19 days compared to 17 and 27 days with placebo liquid. Verum gel: after 16 and 22 days compared to 18 and 28 days with placebo gel). Eschars of the liquid treated burns fell off earlier than of the gel treated burns. Pain scores were not applicable because they were low and differences between the lesions could not be discriminated on the back. CONCLUSION: Combudoron seems to have positive effects on healing of grade 2 laser induced burns which deserve further investigation.",

Histopathological and immunohistochemistry procedures were done in order to get a panel of inflammatory positive cells for CD3 (T lymphocytes), CD45RA (B lymphocytes), CD18 (beta 2 integrin), CD163 (ED2 protein), CD54 (ICAM-1), and MAC 387 (monocytes and macrophages). The statistical treatment of data included a posteriori classification of animals from each group (N = 20) in two subgroups presenting spontaneous precocious or late oedema. Animals that presented precocious oedema were less responsible to Arnica montana 6cH in relation to hemodynamic changes. Instead, rats that exhibited late oedema presented less intense oedema (P = .01), lower percentage of mast cell degranulation (P = .0001), and increase in lymphatic vessels diameter (P = .05). The data suggest an individually qualitative adjustment of inflammatory vascular events by Arnica montana 6cH."

The use of homeopathic preparations of Arnica montana, a flowering herb, has been advocated by physicians, patients, and manufacturers for reduction of postsurgical ecchymosis. The authors evaluate its efficacy after upper eyelid blepharoplasty. METHODS: A prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was performed in which patients were randomly assigned to the administration of homeopathic A. montana or placebo concurrent with unilateral upper eyelid blepharoplasty followed by contralateral treatment at least 1 month later. Ecchymosis was evaluated at days 3 and 7 by rank order of severity and measurement of surface area of observable ecchymosis. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in area of ecchymosis or rank order of ecchymosis severity for days 3 and 7 after treatment with A. montana versus placebo. Additionally, there was no difference in ease of recovery per patient report, and there was no difference in the rate of ecchymosis resolution. CONCLUSIONS: The authors find no evidence that homeopathic A. montana, as used in this study, is beneficial in the reduction or the resolution of ecchymosis after upper eyelid blepharoplasty.",

A homoeopathic combination of A. montana and Bryonia alba was used in aortic valve surgery to evaluate its effectiveness in reducing bleeding, inflammation, pain and myocardial ischaemia. METHODS: One day before surgery, 92 adult patients were randomly assigned to a double-blind parallel trial with either homoeopathic granules or a matching placebo until 4 days after surgery. The primary outcome was the volume of blood/liquid in the drains at their removal. The secondary outcomes included postoperative blood/liquid losses at 12 and 24 h as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), pain, temperature and plasma troponin Ic. RESULTS: At 12 h and 24 h after surgery, then at drain removal, blood losses in homoeopathy and placebo groups were not statistically significant (362 +/- 218, 520 +/- 269 and 640 +/- 297 ml vs. 456 +/- 440, 620 +/- 477 and 796 +/- 717 ml; P= 0.19, 0.23 and 0.35, respectively). The statistical modelling did not show significantly different patterns of CRP, troponin and body temperature changes or of pain perception. The number of transfused packed red cells was not significantly different either (P= 0.58). Two patients from each group died during the study period and the number of serious adverse events was not statistically different (six in homoeopathy vs. 10 in placebo groups; Fisher's exact test P= 0.41). CONCLUSIONS: In the study setting, there was no evidence of effects of A. montana and B. alba combination on bleeding, inflammation, pain or myocardial ischaemia.",

The efficacy of Arnica is presumed to be mainly due to its anti-inflammatory properties and inhibition of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Here we provide further insights into its molecular mode of action. Arnica preparations suppress MMP1 and MMP13 mRNA levels in bovine and human articular chondrocytes in a concentration-dependent manner and in a low concentration range. This suppression may be due to inhibition of DNA binding of the transcription factors AP-1 and NF-kappaB. Interestingly, sesquiterpene lactones present in the preparations were always more active than the pure compounds, demonstrating the advantage of using plant preparations.",

Forty Wistar male rats (300+/-50 g), of which the Tibialis Anterior muscle was surgically lesioned, were divided into four groups (n=10 each): control group received no treatment; the ultrasound group (US) was treated in pulsed mode with 1-MHz frequency, 0.5 W/cm(2) intensity (spatial and temporal average - SATA), duty cycle of 1:2 (2 ms on, 4 ms off, 50%), time of application 3 min per session, one session per day, for 3 days; the phonophoresis or ultrasound plus arnica (US+A) group was treated with arnica with the same US parameters plus arnica gel; and the arnica group (A) was submitted to massage with arnica gel, also for 3 min, once a day, for 3 days. Treatment started 24h after the surgical lesion. On the 4th day after lesion creation, animals were sacrificed and sections of the lesioned, inflamed muscle were removed for quantitative (mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cell count) and qualitative histological analysis. Collected data from the 4 groups were statistically analyzed and the significance level set at p<0.05. Results show higher mononuclear cell density in all three treated groups with no significant difference between them, but values were significantly different (p<0.0001) when compared to control group's. As to polymorphonuclear cell density, significant differences were found between control group (p=0.0134) and US, US+A and A groups; the arnica group presented lesser density of polymorphonuclear cells when compared (p=0.0134) to the other groups. No significant difference was found between US and US+A groups. While the massage with arnica gel proved to be an effective anti-inflammatory on acute muscle lesion in topic use, these results point to ineffectiveness of Arnica montana phonophoresis, US having seemingly checked or minimized its anti-inflammatory effect.",

A method has been developed for the extraction and HPLC-DAD analysis of the secondary metabolites of L. ericoides leaves. This analytical method was validated with 11 secondary metabolites chosen to represent the different classes and polarities of secondary metabolites occurring in L. ericoides leaves, and good responses were obtained for each validation parameter analyzed. The same HPLC analytical method was also employed for online secondary metabolite identification by HPLC-DAD-MS and HPLC-DAD-MS/MS, leading to the identification of di- C-glucosylflavones, coumaroylglucosylflavonols, flavone, flavanones, flavonols, chalcones, goyazensolide, and eremantholide-type sesquiterpene lactones and positional isomeric series of chlorogenic acids possessing caffeic and/or ferulic moieties.

METHODS: Randomised double blind, placebo controlled trial at a tertiary referral centre. 190 patients over the age of 18 undergoing tonsillectomy were randomised into intervention and control groups receiving either Arnica 30c or identical placebo, 2 tablets 6 times in the first post-operative day and then 2 tablets twice a day for the next 7 days. The primary outcome measure was the change in pain scores (visual analogue scale) recorded by the patient on a questionnaire over 14 days post-operatively; Secondary outcome measures were: analgesia consumption, visits to the GP or hospital, antibiotic usage, the day on which their swallowing returned to normal and the day on which they returned to work. RESULTS: 111 (58.4%) completed questionnaires were available for analysis. The Arnica group had a significantly larger drop in pain score from day 1 to day 14 (28.3) compared to the placebo group (23.8) with p < 0.05. The two groups did not differ significantly on analgesic consumption or any of the other secondary outcome measures (number of post-operative visits to GP, use of antibiotics and secondary haemorrhage readmissions).

PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome parameter was difference in knee circumference, defined as the ratio of circumference on day 1 (ART) or day 2 (CLR and AKJ) after surgery to baseline circumference. RESULTS: A total of 227 patients were enrolled in the ART (33% female, mean age 43.2 years;), 35 in the AKJ (71% female, 67.0 years), and 57 in the CLR trial (26% female; 33.4 years). The percentage of change in knee circumference was similar between the treatment groups for ART (group difference Delta=-0.25%, 95% CI: -0.85 to 0.41, p=0.204) and AKJ (Delta=-1.68%, -4.24 to 0.77, p=0.184) and showed homeopathic arnica to have a beneficial effect compared to placebo in CLR (Delta=-1.80%, -3.30 to -0.30, p=0.019). CONCLUSIONS: In all three trials, patients receiving homeopathic arnica showed a trend towards less postoperative swelling compared to patients receiving placebo. However, a significant difference in favour of homeopathic arnica was only found in the CLR trial.",

The anti-inflammatory activity is mainly attributed to their sesquiterpene lactones (SLs) from the helenalin and 11alpha,13-dihydrohelenalin type. To study the penetration kinetics of SLs in Arnica preparations, a stripping method with adhesive tape and pig skin as a model was used. For the determination of SLs in the stripped layers of the stratum corneum (SC), a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method was developed and validated. Thereby the amount of helenalin derivatives was calculated as helenalin isobutyrate, and 11alpha,13-dihydrohelenalin derivatives as 11alpha,13-dihydrohelenalin methacrylate. This GC-MSD method is suitable also to determine low amounts of SLs in Arnica preparations. The penetration behaviour of one gel preparation and two ointment preparations was investigated. The SLs of all preparations show a comparable penetration in and a permeation through the stratum corneum, the uppermost part of the skin. Interestingly, the gel preparation showed a decrease of the penetration rate over 4h, whereas the penetration rate of ointments kept constant over time. Moreover, we could demonstrate that the totally penetrated amount of SLs only depends on the kind of the formulation and of the SLs-content in the formulation but not on the SLs composition or on the used extraction agent.",

METHODS: Twenty-nine patients undergoing rhytidectomy at a tertiary care center were treated perioperatively with either homeopathic A. montana or placebo in a double-blind fashion. Postoperative photographs were analyzed using a novel computer model for color changes, and subjective assessments of postoperative ecchymosis were obtained. RESULTS: No subjective differences were noted between the treatment group and the control group, either by the patients or by the professional staff. No objective difference in the degree of color change was found. Patients receiving homeopathic A. montana were found to have a smaller area of ecchymosis on postoperative days 1, 5, 7, and 10. These differences were statistically significant (P<.05) only on postoperative days 1 (P<.005) and 7 (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: This computer model provides an efficient, objective, and reproducible means with which to assess perioperative color changes, both in terms of area and degree. Patients taking perioperative homeopathic A. montana exhibited less ecchymosis, and that difference was statistically significant (P<.05) on 2 of the 4 postoperative data points evaluated.",

METHODS: Twenty subjects completed a maximal eccentric exercise protocol with the non-dominate elbow flexors to induce delayed onset muscle soreness. Either Arnica or placebo tablets were administered in a random, double- blinded fashion immediately after exercise and at 24 hours and 72 hours after exercise. Before exercise, immediately post-exercise, and at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours post-exercise, assessments of delayed onset muscle soreness and muscle function included: 1) muscle soreness and functional impairment; 2) maximum voluntary contraction torque; 3) muscle swelling; and 4) range of motion tests to document spontaneous muscle shortening and muscle shortening ability. Blood samples drawn before exercise and at 24, 48, and 96 hours after exercise were used to measure muscle enzymes as indirect indices of muscle damage. RESULTS: Regardless of the intervention, the extent of delayed onset muscle soreness and elevations in muscle enzymes were similar on the days following the eccentric exercise protocol. The post-exercise time profiles of decreases in maximum voluntary contraction torque and muscle shortening ability and increases in muscle swelling and spontaneous muscle shortening were similar for each treatment intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study did not substantiate the clinical efficacy of Arnica at a high potency on moderating delayed onset muscle soreness and accompanying symptoms of muscle dysfunction. Despite the findings of this study, future investigations on the clinical efficacy of homeopathic interventions should consider incorporating research strategies that emphasize differential therapeutics for each patient rather than treating a specific disease or symptom complex, such as DOMS, with a single homeopathic remedy."

Sesquiterpene lactones (SLs) are mainly responsible for their anti-inflammatory activity. Here we have studied the penetration kinetics of Arnica tinctures prepared from dried Arnica flowers originating from different chemotypes as well as of their respective dominating SLs, helenalin isobutyrate and 11alpha,13-dihydrohelenalin acetate. Some alcoholic preparations of fresh Arnica flowers and an Arnica fresh plant gel were also included in the study. We used the stripping method with adhesive tape and pig skin as a model and determined the quantity of SLs in the stripped layers of the stratum corneum (SC). Thus, we observed the penetration into and permeation through this uppermost part of the skin. Whereas isolated SLs permeate through the SC only in a very small amount, permeation of SLs was much higher when they were present in the tinctures. Furthermore, differences of permeation were observed between helenalin and dihydrohelenalin derivatives. Permeation through the SC could be determined for the tested Arnica preparations of fresh Arnica flowers with two preparations showing the best penetration behaviour of all the tested substances. Moreover, the effects of incubation time as well as of repeated applications were investigated with one preparation. Altogether, this study shows that a sufficient amount of SLs might permeate the skin barrier by using Arnica preparations to exert anti-inflammatory effects and that the topical use of plant preparations may be advantageous compared to the isolated compounds.",

OBJECTIVE: In this pilot study the efficacy and safety of ARNICA D12 in patients following varicose vein surgery were investigated. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial according to ICH GCP guidelines. SETTING: The study was conducted by a surgeon at the Angiosurgical Clinic, Berlin- Buch. INTERVENTION: After randomized allocation, 60 patients received either ARNICA D12 or placebo. Start of medication occurred the evening before operation with 5 globules. On the operation day one preoperative and hourly postoperative dosages after awakening were given. On days 2-14 of the study 5 globules 3 times a day were given. OUTCOME CRITERIA: Surface (in cm(2) and using a three-point verbal rating scale) and intensity of hematomas induced by operation, complications of wound healing, and intensity of pain (five-point verbal rating scale) as well as efficacy and safety of the study medication were assessed. RESULTS: Hematoma surface was reduced (from day 7 to day 14) under ARNICA by 75.5% and under placebo by 71.5% (p = 0.4726). The comparison of hematoma surface (small, medium, large) using the verbal rating scale yielded a value of p = 0.1260. Pain score decreased by 1.0 +/- 2.2 points under ARNICA and 0.3 +/- 0.8 points under placebo (p = 0.1977). Remission or improvement of pain was observed in 43.3% of patients in the ARNICA group and in 27.6% of patients in the placebo group. Tolerability was rated as very good in all cases. CONCLUSION: The results of this pilot study showed a trend towards a beneficial effect of ARNICA D12 with regard to reduction of hematoma and pain during the postoperative course. For a statistically significant proof of efficacy of ARNICA D12 in patients following varicose vein surgery a larger sample size is necessary.",

Five pills of Arnica D30 or placebo were given morning and evening. Treatment started on the evening before the marathon and continued on day of the race and the three following days. The runners assessed muscular soreness on a visual analogue scale. Muscle enzymes, electrolytes and creatinine were measured before and after the marathon. RESULTS: Muscle soreness immediately after the marathon run was lower in the Arnica group than in the placebo group (P = 0.04). Cell damage measured by enzymes was similar in the Arnica and the placebo group.

      "abstract": "Homeopathic arnica is widely believed to control bruising, reduce swelling and promote recovery after local trauma; many patients therefore take it perioperatively. To determine whether this treatment has any effect, we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial with three parallel arms. 64 adults undergoing elective surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome were randomized to take three tablets daily of homeopathic arnica 30C or 6C or placebo for seven days before surgery and fourteen days after surgery. Primary outcome measures were pain (short form McGill Pain Questionnaire) and bruising (colour separation analysis) at four days after surgery. Secondary outcome measures were swelling (wrist circumference) and use of analgesic medication (patient diary). 62 patients could be included in the intention-to-treat analysis. There were no group differences on the primary outcome measures of pain (P=0.79) and bruising (P=0.45) at day four. Swelling and use of analgesic medication also did not differ between arnica and placebo groups. Adverse events were reported by 2 patients in the arnica 6C group, 3 in the placebo group and 4 in the arnica 30C group. The results of this trial do not suggest that homeopathic arnica has an advantage over placebo in reducing postoperative pain, bruising and swelling in patients undergoing elective hand surgery.",

Scores on the pain, stiffness, and function subscales also showed significant reductions at these timepoints. The overall local adverse-event rate of 7.6% included only one allergic reaction. Sixty-nine patients (87%) rated the tolerability of the gel as \"good\" or \"fairly good,\" and 76% would use it again. Topical application of Arnica montana gel for 6 weeks was a safe, well-tolerated, and effective treatment of mild to moderate OA of the knee.",

OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of topical arnica in the prevention and resolution of laser-induced bruising. METHODS: Nineteen patients with facial telangiectases were enrolled in this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study and were divided into pretreatment and posttreatment groups. The pretreatment group applied arnica with vehicle to one side of the face and vehicle alone to the other side of the face twice a day for 2 weeks prior to laser treatment. The posttreatment group followed the same procedure for 2 weeks after laser treatment. On day 0, all patients were treated for facial telangiectases using a 585 nm pulsed dye laser. Bruising was assessed using a visual analog scale on days 0, 3, 7, 10, 14, and 17 by the patient and the physician. In addition, photographs taken at each of the follow-up visits were later assessed by a second physician using the visual analog scale. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the mean scores of arnica and vehicle (P = 0.496) and the mean scores of arnica and vehicle (P = 0.359) in the pretreatment and posttreatment groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: No significant difference was found between topical arnica and vehicle in the prevention or resolution of bruising.",

INTERVENTION: Homeopathic Arnica tablets and herbal Arnica ointment compared to placebos. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Grip strength, wrist circumference, and perceived pain measured 1 and 2 weeks after surgery. RESULTS: No difference in grip strength or wrist circumference was found between the 2 groups. However, there was a significant reduction in pain experienced after 2 weeks in the Arnica-treated group (P<.03). CONCLUSIONS: The role of homeopathic and herbal agents for recovery after surgery merits further investigation.",

The effects of arnica C30 on pain and postoperative recovery after total abdominal hysterectomy were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, controlled study. Of 93 women entered into the study, 20 did not complete protocol treatment: nine were excluded because they failed to comply with the protocol, nine had their operations cancelled or changed within 24 h and two had to be withdrawn because of the recurrence of previously chronic painful conditions. Those who did not complete protocol treatment were equally divided between the arnica (nine patients) and placebo groups (11 patients). 73 patients completed the study, of whom 35 received placebo and 38 received arnica C30. The placebo group had a greater median age and the arnica group had slightly longer operations; nevertheless, no significant difference between the two groups could be demonstrated. We conclude that arnica in homoeopathic potency had no effect on postoperative recovery in the context of our study.",

Contact allergy of the delayed type to Arnica tincture could be proven by patch testing. Early diagnosis and treatment prevented exacerbation and spreading of the disease. In view of the wide use of Arnica preparations, particularly for self-medication, and the notable sensitizing potential, Arnica tincture should be a regular component of patch test series, at least when drug allergy is suspected."

      "abstract": "The effects of atmospheric NH3 and SO2 separately and in combination on the growth and competitive ability of three species of the Violion caninae alliance were investigated. Growth and nutrient concentrations of Viola canina and Arnica montana in mixed culture with Agrostis capillaris were examined in relation to that in monoculture. Seedlings were transplanted into heathland topsoil in pots and placed in open-top chambers for 9 months from autumn to summer, where they were exposed to ambient air, 90 μ m-3 SO2 , 50 μg m-3 NH3 and to the combination of NH2 and SO2 . In the NH3 + SO2 treatment, a more-than-additive increase in nitrogen and sulphur concentrations was observed indicating co-deposition. NH3 influenced the nutritional status of V. canina the most, increasing the nitrogen, phosphorus, and magnesium concentrations and reducing those of potassium and calcium. NH3 fumigation significantly stimulated shoot growth of all three species and root growth of A. capillaris, while SO2 reduced only the root growth of A. capillaris. The relative yield of V. canina was reduced by 20-30% in the presence of the air pollutants. The relative yield of A. montana was stimulated by 30-40% in treatments including SO2 compared with that in ambient air or NH3 alone. The competitive ability of both dicotyledons in mixed culture with A. capillaris was strongly reduced by NH3 and was unaffected by SO2 . The consequences of exposure to NH3 and SO2 for the survival and maintenance of threatened species in heathland vegetation are discussed."

From the literature more than 35 references with more than 100 cases of contact dermatitis could be cited, completed by four own cases. In most cases sensitization was induced by self treatment with tincture of Arnica, whereas occupational contact dermatitis in drug sellers of pharmacists is rare. Chemical and animal experimental investigations corroborated the high sensitizing capacity of Arnica montana L. and near related Arnica species. The low toxic threshold often causes also primary toxic skin reactions. The sesquiterpene lactones helenalin, its acetate and methacrylate have been proved to be the primary sensitizers. As more Arnica-containing drugs are entering the market it is proposed to include Arnica again in the standard test series.",
