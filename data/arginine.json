      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapy may be a future treatment for myocardial infarction (MI). However, few studies have assessed the therapeutic efficacy of adipose tissue-derived MSCs (ADSCs) obtained from elderly patients in comparison to that of bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs) from the same elderly patients. The metabolomics results revealed a significantly higher L-arginine excretion from aged ADSCs vs BMSCs in hypoxic conditions. This was hypothesized as the possible mechanism that ADSCs showed an improved angiogenic capacity and enhanced the therapeutic effect on ischemic heart diseases. AIM: To investigate the role of L-arginine in enhancing angiogenesis and cardiac protection by comparing ADSCs and BMSCs in hypoxic conditions for MI therapy. METHODS: Metabolomic profiling of supernatants from ADSCs and BMSCs under hypoxic conditions were performed. Then, arginine succinate lyase (ASL) overexpression and short hairpin RNA plasmid were prepared and transfected into BMSCs. Subsequently, in vitro wound healing and Matrigel tube formation assays were used to verify the proangiogenetic effects of ADSC positive control, BMSCs, BMSCs ASL short hairpin RNA, BMSCs ASL overexpressed, and BMSC negative control on cocultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. All sample sizes, which were determined to meet the statistical requirements and be greater than 3, were established on the basis of previously established literature standards. The protein levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor, etc. were detected. In vivo, the five types of cells were transplanted into the infarcted area of MI rat models, and the therapeutic effects of the transplanted cells were evaluated by echocardiography on cardiac function and by Masson's staining/terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated nick end labeling assay/immunofluorescence detection on the infarcted area. RESULTS: Metabolomic analysis showed that L-arginine was increased. Using ASL gene transfection, we upregulated the production of L-arginine in aged patient-derived BMSCs in vitro, which in turn enhanced mitogen activated protein kinase and VEGF receptor 2 protein expression, VEGF and basic fibroblast growth factor secretion, and inductive angiogenesis to levels comparable to donor-matched ADSCs. After the cell transplantation in vivo, the modified BMSCs as well as ADSCs exhibited decreased apoptotic cells, enhanced vessel formation, reduced scar size, and improved cardiac function in the MI rat model. The therapeutic efficacy decreased by inhibiting L-arginine synthesis. CONCLUSION: L-arginine is important for inducing therapeutic angiogenesis for ADSCs and BMSCs in hypoxic conditions. ADSCs have higher L-arginine secretion, which leads to better angiogenesis induction and cardiac protection. ADSC transplantation is a promising autologous cell therapy strategy in the context of the present aging society."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines suggest adding arginine vasopressin (AVP) when norepinephrine (NE) doses reach 0.25-0.50 µg/kg/min in septic shock patients. However, relying solely on a NE threshold has limitations, as other factors may be valuable in guiding AVP therapy during septic shock. Therefore, we aimed to identify additional patient characteristics associated with AVP hemodynamic responsiveness. METHODS: A multicenter, prospective, observational study was conducted among adult ICU patients who met the predefined criteria for septic shock (not reaching the individual target mean arterial pressure despite adequate fluid resuscitation and NE base dose > 0.25 µg/kg/min) and received AVP therapy. AVP hemodynamic responsiveness was the primary study outcome, defined as stabilization or decrease of NE infusion rate two hours after initiating AVP. Secondary outcomes included shock duration and rebound hypotension following termination of AVP infusion. Univariate and multivariable regression analyses were performed to detect associations between characteristics and outcomes. RESULTS: Between May 2020 and October 2023, 200 septic shock patients originating from 11 different ICUs were included. Of these, 153 (79%) met the definition for AVP hemodynamic responsiveness. Obesity and hyperlactatemia was negatively associated with AVP-response (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] 0.30, 95%CI 0.14-0.65 and aOR 0.86, 95%CI 0.75-0.99, respectively), while a NE infusion rate ≥ 0.30 µg/kg/min showed positive odds of AVP response (aOR 2.33, 95%CI 1.06-5.14). Incidence of new-onset atrial fibrillation was lower in AVP responders than non-responders (4% vs. 14%, p = 0.013). Higher body mass index (BMI) , NE infusion rate and duration prior to AVP initiation was associated with longer shock duration (aOR 1.06, 95%CI 1.02-1.11, aOR 1.12, 95%CI 1.01-1.25, and 1.01 95% CI 1.00-1.03, respectively), while higher pH associated with lower likelihood of prolonged shock (aOR 0.80, 95%CI 0.64-0.99). Rebound hypotension occurred in 9% when AVP was terminated, and AVP duration > 24 h was negatively associated with rebound hypotension (OR 0.22, 95%CI 0.05-0.85). CONCLUSIONS: Arterial lactate, pH, BMI, and NE duration and dose were associated with AVP responsiveness and shock duration during septic shock, and rebound hypotension occurred in 9% during recovery. Our findings suggest that beyond NE thresholds, specific factors could be considered to optimize adjunctive AVP therapy in septic shock patients."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Distinguishing arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) from primary polydipsia is challenging. There is no validated initial laboratory assessment or diagnostic score to rule-in or rule-out arginine vasopressin deficiency during the first consultation. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic potential of basal laboratory parameters and to develop a practical diagnostic score. METHODS: Data from two international multicentre studies of patients with arginine vasopressin deficiency and primary polydipsia undergoing the hypertonic saline test were used to evaluate the diagnostic potential of basal laboratory tests and to develop a score incorporating laboratory results, symptoms, and medical history. CODDI was a non-randomised, controlled, diagnostic, international, multicentre non-inferiority study in 11 tertiary medical centres in Switzerland, Germany, and Brazil. CARGOx was a randomised, controlled, cross-over, diagnostic, international, multicentre non-inferiority study across seven tertiary medical centres in Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, the UK, and Brazil. Participants were adult patients with polydipsia (>3 L per day) and hypotonic polyuria (>50 mL/kg bodyweight in 24 h and urine osmolality <800 mOsm/kg) and adult patients with a previous diagnosis of arginine vasopressin deficiency. Data were derived from the initial consultation and a basal laboratory test. For each laboratory parameter, the cutoffs resulting in the highest specificity at 100% sensitivity and the highest sensitivity at 100% specificity were identified. For the diagnostic score, the overall best cutoff, high-sensitivity cutoff (≥95% sensitivity), and high-specificity cutoff (≥95% specificity) were identified. Each cutoff was derived from the first study (development), and their performance was determined in the second study (validation). The final score included the sum of: basal plasma sodium multiplied by plasma osmolality, divided by 100; -50 points for plasma copeptin more than 4·9 pmol/L; +30 points for nycturia (≥3 times per night) or +20 points for nycturia (2 times per night); +20 points for sudden polyuria or polydipsia onset; +30 points for drinking more than 1 L per night; +50 points for anterior pituitary dysfunction and +50 points for pituitary surgery history. The diagnostic performance in predicting arginine vasopressin deficiency was examined by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) and by sensitivity and specificity. The studies were registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01940614 and NCT03572166). FINDINGS: 299 patients who underwent the hypertonic saline test from July 1, 2013, to Sept 30, 2022 were included in this analysis. 141 patients were in the development cohort (59 [42%] had arginine vasopressin deficiency; 82 [58%] had primary polydipsia) and 158 patients were in the validation cohort (69 [44%] had arginine vasopressin deficiency; 89 [56%] had primary polydipsia). In the development cohort, the median age of patients with arginine vasopressin deficiency was 45 years (IQR 33-53), with 38 (64%) of 59 being female and 21 (36%) male, compared with a median age of 32 years (IQR 24-44) and 55 (67%) of 82 being female and 27 (33%) male in the group of patients with primary polydipsia. In the validation cohort, patients with arginine vasopressin deficiency had a median age of 42 years (IQR 32-54), with 38 (55%) of 69 being female and 31 (45%) male, compared with a median age of 37 years (IQR 28-50) and 68 (76%) of 89 being female and 21 (24%) male for patients with primary polydipsia. In the validation cohort, basal plasma sodium of more than 145 mmol/L identified arginine vasopressin deficiency with 100% specificity (95% CI 61-100), whereas primary polydipsia was identified by sodium less than 135 mmol/L with 100% specificity (34-100) and by copeptin more than 5·6 pmol/L with 100% specificity (74-100). In the validation cohort, the clinical score had an AUC of 91% (87-96), a cutoff of more than 441 points provided an overall accuracy of 86% (80-91) for diagnosing arginine vasopressin deficiency. In the validation cohort, the high-specificity cutoff of less than 415 points had 93% specificity (87-99) for diagnosing primary polydipsia, and the high-specificity cutoff of more than 461 points had 93% specificity (88-98) for diagnosing arginine vasopressin deficiency. This stepwise approach enabled diagnosis in 223 (75%) of 299 patients. INTERPRETATION: We introduce a stepwise diagnostic approach, starting with basal laboratory tests and rule-in and rule-out criteria for immediate treatment. For intermediate cases, the novel score aids in identifying arginine vasopressin deficiency or primary polydipsia with high accuracy. This approach could lead to shortening the diagnostic timeline and reducing dependence on stimulation or dynamic tests. FUNDING: Swiss National Science Foundation.

      "abstract": "The early recognition of ifosfamide-related renal dysfunction, including arginine vasopressin resistance (previously referred to as diabetes insipidus), which is characterized by polyuria due to the inability of the collecting duct to concentrate urine, as well as direct proximal tubular injury, which is characterized by numerous metabolic disturbances including hypophosphatemia, metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, and glucosuria, is paramount to timely initiation of treatment and titration of desmopressin. In this report, we present a case of a 42-year-old female with a history of spindle cell carcinoma of the left thigh, who was referred to the inpatient nephrology consult service for acute kidney injury, polyuria, and metabolic derangements following her sixth cycle of doxorubicin-ifosfamide chemotherapy. The patient was treated with supratherapeutic doses of desmopressin, with successful improvement of her polyuria. We review the pathophysiology of different forms of ifosfamide-associated nephrotoxicity, including arginine vasopressin resistance, the challenges of diagnosing arginine vasopressin disorders, and the utility of desmopressin in the management of arginine vasopressin resistance. This case also highlights the clinical implications of using copeptin in the diagnosis of arginine vasopressin resistance, leading to effective treatment and improving patient outcomes."

      "abstract": "Distinct clinical phenotypes of periodontitis are associated with specific microbiome profiles and diverse inflammatory conditions. Current drug delivery systems face challenges in precisely modulating this dynamic microenvironment. Effective inhibition of bone resorption can only be achieved through a strategic response to bacterial infections and inflammation within the periodontal pocket, followed by prompt treatment tailored to disease severity. In this study, tannic acid (TA) is loaded into hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (HMSNs) that are functionalized with positively charged polyarginines (R8) and negatively charged human serum albumin (HSA). These HMSNs-R8@TA-HSA (HRT) nanoparticles are then encapsulated within an injectable Nap-Gly-Phe-Phe-Tyr-OH (NapGFFY) hydrogel (NHRT). The intermediate linker R8 can interact with both arginine gingipain A (RgpA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which serve as markers of bacterial infections and inflammation, respectively. HSA, arginine, TA, and nitric oxide are differentially released from the hydrogel in response to varying concentrations of RgpA and ROS, demonstrating excellent antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. This smart RgpA/ROS dual-responsive and injectable hydrogel with multifunctional therapy provides new prospects for the management of periodontitis."

      "abstract": "We present a prospective randomized, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous arginine in patients 3-21 years hospitalized with sickle cell disease vaso-occlusive pain episodes (SCD-VOE) at two tertiary-care children's hospitals. Participants were randomized into 1 of 3 arms: Standard-dose (SD; 100 mg/kg/dose) every 8 h, Loading-dose (200 mg/kg followed by SD), or Placebo. The primary outcome was total parenteral opioid use (TPO). Secondary outcomes included time-to-crisis-resolution, pain scores, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), arginine bioavailability, and biomarkers of oxidative stress/mitochondrial function. Of 1548 patients screened, 108 were randomized (36 per study-arm; mean 12.6 ± 3.8 years, 52% female, and 65% hemoglobin-SS). This study did not meet its primary endpoint. TPO, time-to-crisis-resolution, pain scores, and PROs at discharge were similar across arms. Post hoc sensitivity analyses of children 5-16 years old demonstrated nearly double TPO utilization in those receiving placebo versus arginine (n = 87, p = 0.056), achieving significance in patients with plasma arginine < 60 μM. Arginine was low at presentation in 79% of patients (mean 50 ± 28 μM), and increased with arginine therapy (p < 0.001). Arginine bioavailability at VOE presentation inversely correlated with time-to-crisis-resolution (r = -0.39, p = 0.01) after placebo, an association eliminated by arginine supplementation (r = -0.04, p = 0.70). A dose-dependent increase in platelet-mitochondrial activity occurred after arginine versus no change after placebo (p < 0.001); plasma protein-carbonyl levels, a measure of oxidative stress, decreased after arginine therapy (p < 0.001) but increased in the placebo group (p = 0.02). SCD-VOE is associated with an acquired arginine deficiency that correlates with worse clinical outcomes. Arginine improved mitochondrial function and decreased oxidative stress compared to placebo, with clinically relevant opioid-sparing becoming significant in children with the lowest arginine concentration.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Arginine auxotrophy has been reported in a subset of cancers with inherently defective de novo arginine synthesis. However, the use of arginine deprivation therapy seems to be unequally effective, partially owing to the resistance acquired by cancer cells. Study of underlying factors involved in this response thus becomes of utmost importance. Meanwhile, the function of etoposide-induced 2.4 homolog (EI24) in cancer metabolism, and specifically in arginine metabolism, remains unknown. METHODS: EI24 was overexpressed in cancer cells using a doxycycline-inducible system or adenovirus transduction, while siRNA was used to knockdown EI24. Amino acid(s) deprivation medium was exploited with a cell viability assay to check the reliance of cancer cell survival on arginine. Protein expression and activation were examined through western blot and co-immunoprecipitation blot. Furthermore, global and specific protein translation were assessed through the SUnSET assay and polysome fractionation analysis. Gene expression and arginine level were downloaded from public cancer datasets for in silico validation including gene set enrichment and survival analysis to objectively evaluate the association between EI24 and arginine metabolism. RESULTS: EI24 promoted cancer survival under arginine starvation. Mechanistically, EI24 replenished translation of argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1) by inducing the inactive S-nitrosylated form of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), leading to release of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) axis. This tumor-promoting action of EI24 could be found in multiple ASS1-deficient cancer cells regardless of p53 status. Furthermore, expression of EI24 was linked to enrichment of arginine metabolism pathway as well as poor survival of patients with cancer across various cancer types, suggesting its role in cancer resistance to arginine deprivation. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to report the role of EI24 in promoting cancer survival via translational regulation of the metabolic enzyme ASS1, thus paving a route for further investigation into the link between EI24 and cancer metabolism.",

      "abstract": "Among the type I Protein Arginine Methyltransferases (PRMTs), PRMT1 plays a predominant part in catalyzing asymmetric dimethylation of arginine residues on histone or nonhistone substrates. PRMT1 level is abnormally elevated in numerous cancer cell types and inflammation diseases. Compared to the enzymatic functions of PRMT1, its nonenzymatic functions are shortly investigated in diseases. Previous study has confirmed that the stability of orphan receptor TR3, a binding partner of PRMT1, is closely regulated by PRMT1, but the effect is independent of PRMT1's methyltransferase activity, but depends on the physical binding of PRMT1. To date, multiple inhibitors targeting methyltransferase enzymatic activity of PRMT1 are developed, but all of them lack selectivity for PRMT1. Among them, only GSK3368715 advanced to clinical trials but was discontinued in phase I due to inadequate efficacy and thrombosis toxicity. Currently, small molecule degraders are gaining significant attention due to their advantages in efficacy and selectivity in therapeutic applications. Presumably, a potent and selective PRMT1 degrader could serve as a valuable alternative in the treatment of PRMT1-driven diseases and act as an instrumental tool in uncovering additional nonenzymatic functions of PRMT1. To date, however, the development of a PRMT1 degrader remains a challenge, with no such agents reported. In this study, we present the design, synthesis and characterization of CM112 (compound 12), a first-in-class PRMT1 degrader, designed by tethering adamantane to MS023, a type I PRMTs pan inhibitor, via a 5-PEG linker. CM112 demonstrates a concentration- and time-dependent ability to induce PRMT1 degradation in various solid cancer cell lines. Additionally, CM112 shows high selectivity for PRMT1 degradation, without causing degradation of other type I PRMTs (PRMT3/4/6), although it retains potent inhibitory effects on their enzymatic activity. Pharmacokinetics studies indicated that CM112 possesses favorable bioavailability in mice. Notably, as anticipated, CM112 could target PRMT1's nonenzymatic function by downregulating the stability of the orphan receptor TR3, an effect not observed with the PRMT1 inhibitor MS023, that is in consistence with the previous findings. Taken together, CM112 represents a valuable tool for elucidating the unknown, methyltransferase-independent roles of PRMT1 in disease progression and pave the way for developing more potent and drug like PRMT1 degraders in future."

Studies suggest it may improve gut barrier function and reduce inflammation in conditions such as colitis or sepsis. However, its specific efficacy in diabetic enteropathy (a complication of diabetes involving intestinal dysfunction, inflammation, and neuropathy) is less studied. To verify whether L-arginine and silkworm pupae components have a role in the treatment of diabetic enteropathy via the regulation of other cytokines and suppression of CD4+ T lymphocyte proliferation, a special medical-purpose formula containing both of these components was tested. For the first time, we have integrated L-arginine and silkworm pupae protein into enteral nutrition formulations for testing its anti-inflammatory potential. We have found that these formulations can improve the characteristics of diabetic intestinal inflammation through nutrient-modulating effects and nutritional efficacy. In addition, L-arginine (L-arginine, L-arg) enhances the immunomodulatory effects of special medical purpose formulas for diabetes mellitus. We utilized an oxidative stress model of small intestinal epithelial cells induced by high glucose and an inflammation model of the small intestine triggered by lipopolysaccharide in mice. The aim was to further investigate the protective effects of L-arginine and enteral nutritional preparations derived from silkworm pupae protein components on the intestinal tract.

      "abstract": "Background Chronic high-fat diets (HFDs) lead to an imbalance of calcium homeostasis in cardiomyocytes, which contributes to the development of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, dilated cardiomyopathy, and other cardiovascular diseases. Aloe-emodin (AE) is an anthraquinone component isolated from aloe, rhubarb, and cassia seed, having cardiovascular protective, hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and other pharmacological effects. Objective This study aimed to explore the specific role of AE in obesity/hyperlipidemia-induced myocardial intracellular calcium homeostasis imbalance. Methods Wistar rats (male, 220 ± 20 g) were fed HFD for four weeks and AE (100 mg/kg) was administrated for six weeks after confirmation of the HFD model. Serum lipids, reactive oxygen species levels, malondialdehyde levels, and superoxide dismutase levels were measured by commercial biochemical kits. Electrocardiograms of rats were recorded with the BL-420F biological function experimental system. Calcium transients and resting intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were determined by the Langendorff-perfused heart model. Protein levels of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), and cardiac Ca2+ handling proteins were evaluated by western blot analysis. Results HFD-induced hearts exhibited a reduced amplitude of Ca2+ transients and increased resting levels of [Ca2+] in the heart; AE treatment significantly improved these parameters. Furthermore, the HFD-induced heart showed downregulation of PRMT1, upregulation of CaMKII, and abnormalities in the levels of Ca2+ handling proteins. All these deleterious changes were significantly suppressed by the AE treatment. Moreover, AE treatment prevented palmitic acid (PA)-induced calcium overload in H9C2 cells; this effect was reduced by the application of an inhibitor of PRMT1. Conclusion Taken together, this study demonstrates that AE could alleviate HFD/PA-induced myocardial intracellular calcium homeostasis imbalance via the PRMT1/CaMKII signaling pathway."

      "abstract": "L-arginine induces the expression of utrophin in skeletal muscle cells, so it has been proposed as a pharmacological treatment to attenuate the symptoms of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). On the other hand, it has been described that one of the pathways that participates in the expression of utrophin in muscle is the Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1)/ErbB receptors pathway. Several studies have postulated that disintegrin and metalloprotease-17 (ADAM17) causes the proteolytic processing of NRG of transmembrane, allowing the release of NRG to the medium, which when joining its ErbB receptor activates the signaling pathway that triggers utrophin transcription. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of L-arginine in the activation of NRG-1/ErbB pathway and utrophin mRNA levels in C2C12 cells, and the participation of ADAM17 in this process. Our results indicate that L-arginine induces phosphorylation of ErbB2 and increases utrophin mRNA levels in C2C12 myotubes, with a maximum increase of 2-fold at 4 h post-stimulation. This effect is not observed when the myotubes are stimulated in the presence of GM6001 (general metalloprotease inhibitor) or PD-158780 (specific inhibitor of ErbB receptor phosphorylation). Experiments performed by flow cytometry suggest that L-arginine stimulates ADAM17 activation in our study model. Furthermore, immunofluorescence analysis supports our findings that L-arginine stimulates ADAM17 increase in treated myotubes. However, our results using pharmacological inhibitors suggest that ADAM17 does not participate in utrophin expression in C2C12 cells treated with L-arginine. The results obtained help to clarify the mechanism of action of L-arginine in the expression of utrophin in muscle cells, which will contribute to the design of new therapeutic strategies in pathologies such as DMD."

Glycosylation of proteins is very common in physiological and biochemical processes and can modulate the interaction of proteins with their target. In this study, eight glycosyl groups were used to modify the arginine of melittin at sites 22 and/or 24, and single and double arginine N-glycosylated peptides were designed and synthesized. Among the acquired 24 glycopeptides, MLT-1c, MLT-3c, MLT-1f, MLT-3f, MLT-1g, and MLT-3h were found to possess higher helicity, while MLT-3c, MLT-3f and MLT-3h showed dramatically reduced hemolytic activity, especially MLT-3c, whose HC50 value is 199.3 μM. MLT-1a, MLT-3a and MLT-2c exhibited improved inhibitory activity against Puzza streptococcus, and the MIC was 4 μg mL-1. MLT-1e and MLT-2g have the strongest tolerance to trypsase, and MLT-3c has the highest therapeutic index. In general, rhamnosyl-modified melittin MLT-3c could be a potent agent for antibacterial and antitumor therapy with high stability and low hemolytic side effects."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Placental accreta spectrum (PAS) is a collective term for a range of pregnancy complications caused by abnormal placental implantation, posing a threat to the lives of both the mother and the fetus. This study aimed to screen for placental marker metabolites of PAS and assess the effect of L-Arginine on trophoblast invasion. METHODS: Placental tissues were collected from a total of 15 pregnant women, including 10 women diagnosed with PAS and 5 women with normal pregnancies. Histological staining was used to characterize pathological changes in the placenta. The changes in endogenous placental metabolites by LC-MS/MS. Subsequently, the role of marker metabolite L-Arginine on HTR-8/Svneo invasion was explored, and protein transcription and expression levels of GPRC6A/PI3K/AKT/MMP2/MMP9 were determined by RT-qPCR and western blot. RESULTS: The placentas of PAS patients were mostly infiltrative invasion, with active proliferation and inhibited apoptosis of trophoblast cells. By LC-MS/MS, we identified 13 significantly different metabolites between healthy and PAS pregnant women's placenta tissue. Among them, placental concentrations of L-Arginine were significantly higher in PAS pregnant women than in controls. In vitro, L-Arginine promoted the proliferation and migration of HTR8/SVneo cells and upregulated the transcription and expression of proteins related to the GPRC6A/PI3K/AKT pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that L-Arginine may promote trophoblast invasion and migration in placental implantation by upregulating the GPRC6A/PI3K/AKT pathway. This provides a new basis for screening appropriate metabolic markers for PAS, thus contributing to the prevention and treatment of PAS.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia, the age-related decline in muscle mass and function, poses a major health risk to the elderly population. Although dietary advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) have been implicated in worsening sarcopenia, the precise molecular mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS: A sarcopenia animal model was established by feeding a high AGE diet to C57BL/6 mice. Muscle function and mass were assessed using grip strength tests, and rotarod tests. Proteomic analysis was used to identify differentially expressed proteins. Immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and co-immunoprecipitation were employed to investigate protein interactions both in vivo and in vitro. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR and Western blotting were conducted to measure gene and protein expression levels. RESULTS: Our results revealed that dietary AGEs accelerated the onset of sarcopenia in mice by triggering apoptosis. Proteomic analysis showed a marked upregulation of protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) in the muscle tissues of mice fed a high AGE diet. PRMT1 mediated the arginine methylation of CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 3 (CRTC3) at the R534 site within its transactivation domain, leading to CRTC3 activation. The activated CRTC3, together with Forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a), transactivated the BAX (BCL2 associated X) gene, initiating Bax downstream signaling, promoting apoptosis in muscle cells, and contributing to muscle atrophy. Inhibition of PRMT1 prevented CRTC3 methylation and suppressed Bax-mediated apoptotic signaling in vitro. Moreover, in vivo treatment with PRMT1 and Bax inhibitors significantly attenuated AGE-induced sarcopenia in mice. CONCLUSION: PRMT1-mediated CRTC3 arginine methylation plays a critical role in AGE-induced sarcopenia and suggests potential therapeutic targets for preventing sarcopenia progression.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in cancer therapy have underscored the importance of targeting specific metabolic pathways. In this study, we propose a precision nutrition approach aimed at lysosomal function in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Using patient-derived GBM cells, we identify lysosomal activity as a unique metabolic biomarker of tumorigenesis, controlling the efficacy of temozolomide (TMZ), a standard GBM therapy. Employing combined analyses of clinical patient samples and xenograft models, we further elucidate the pivotal role of Transcription Factor Binding To IGHM Enhancer 3 (TFE3), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, in modulating malignant properties, particularly TMZ tolerance, by regulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α)-mediated mitochondrial activity. Notably, we find that lysine protects GBM cells from lysosomal stress by counteracting arginine's effects on nitric oxide production. The lysine restriction mimetic, homoarginine administration, significantly enhances the efficacy of anticancer therapies through lysosomal dysfunction. This study underscores the critical role of lysosomal function modulated by amino acid metabolism in GBM pathogenesis and treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Historically, the management of atherosclerosis was focused on decreasing lipid profile levels; however, recent evidence demonstrated that platelets and leukocytes play an important role in forming and exacerbating atherosclerosis. L-arginine (L-Arg), a precursor to nitric oxide (NO), plays a critical role in modulating oxidative stress and influencing platelet-leukocyte recruitment and has been extensively addressed in the context of CVD. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to perform a comprehensive literature review on l-Arg metabolism in the causative pathway of atherosclerosis compared to conventional treatment and it as a putative therapeutic approach. RESULTS: L-Arg supplementation has shown promising effects on NO production, improving endothelial function and reducing oxidative stress in preclinical models. Clinical studies have indicated moderate improvements in vascular health markers, including reductions in inflammation and oxidative stress, although results have varied across studies. The potential of l-Arg to modify platelet-leukocyte recruitment and slow the progression of atherosclerotic plaque development has been observed in certain studies. However, these benefits remain inconsistent, and more robust clinical trials are needed to confirm its effectiveness. Additionally, while l-Arg appears to be relatively safe, some studies reported mild gastrointestinal discomfort as a common side effect. CONCLUSION: l-Arg holds potential as a complementary or alternative treatment for atherosclerosis, particularly in improving endothelial function and reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. However, the variability in clinical outcomes and the lack of long-term data required further investigation into assessing therapeutic benefits. Future studies should focus on determining optimal dosing regimens, evaluating their long-term safety, and assessing their potential in combination with other therapies to enhance cardiovascular outcomes."

      "abstract": "Arginine deprivation has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy in cancer treatment due to the auxotrophy of certain tumors. Many cancers, such as pancreatic, colorectal, and hepatocellular carcinoma, exhibit downregulated argininosuccinate synthetase, making them reliant on external arginine sources. This dependency allows targeted therapies that deplete arginine, inhibiting tumor growth while sparing normal cells. Arginine is crucial for various cellular processes, including protein synthesis and immune function. Its deprivation affects both tumor metabolism and immune responses, potentially enhancing cancer therapy. Studies have explored using enzymes like arginine deiminase and arginase, often modified for increased stability and reduced immunogenicity, to effectively lower arginine levels in the tumor microenvironment. These approaches show promise, particularly in tumors with low argininosuccinate synthetase expression. However, the impact on immune cells and the potential for resistance highlight the need for further research. Combining arginine deprivation with other treatments might improve outcomes, offering a novel approach to combat arginine-dependent cancers.",

Serum nitric oxide concentration significantly decreased in rats that received L-NAME alone, while co-treatment with MO and Lisinopril showed a significant increase in nitric oxide levels. Co-treatment with MO and Lisinopril significantly reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations in the cardiac and renal tissues, whereas L-NAME alone caused a significant increase in MDA concentration. The expressions of cardiac and renal caspase-3 significantly increased in L-NAME alone treated rats, while co-treatments with MO and Lisinopril significantly reduced the expressions of caspase-3. In conclusion, co-treatment with MO effectively reduced arterial pressure and indices of hypertension in rats, mitigated the oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by L-NAME.

Serum nitric oxide concentration significantly decreased in rats that received L-NAME alone, while co-treatment with MO and Lisinopril showed a significant increase in nitric oxide levels. Co-treatment with MO and Lisinopril significantly reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations in the cardiac and renal tissues, whereas L-NAME alone caused a significant increase in MDA concentration. The expressions of cardiac and renal caspase-3 significantly increased in L-NAME alone treated rats, while co-treatments with MO and Lisinopril significantly reduced the expressions of caspase-3. In conclusion, co-treatment with MO effectively reduced arterial pressure and indices of hypertension in rats, mitigated the oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by L-NAME. Therefore, the inclusion of MO seeds in hypertension management may serve as an effective remedy. Keywords: Moringa oliefera, L-NAME, Hypertension, Oxidative Stress, Nitric oxide.",

This study aims to evaluate its potential for enhancing diabetic wound repair through combined ionic crosslinking and bioactive component synergy. The hydrogel demonstrates exceptional swelling properties conducive to the absorption of wound exudate. Furthermore, it exhibits remarkable antibacterial and antioxidant activities. The ASASG hydrogel shows good biocompatibility, facilitates hemostasis and promotes the migration of NIH 3 T3 fibroblasts. Animal studies have revealed that ASASG hydrogel significantly enhances wound healing, accelerates re-epithelialization, and fosters collagen deposition in diabetic rats. Furthermore, ASASG hydrogels mitigated inflammatory cell infiltration by down-regulating IL-6 expression and concurrently up-regulating TGF-β expression. Notably, ASASG hydrogels also stimulate angiogenesis by enhancing the expressions of VEGF and bFGF. Therefore, the use of ASASG hydrogel in the treatment of diabetic wounds is a possible therapeutic approach."

      "abstract": "Uncontrolled hypertension is a primary contributor to tissue damage in multiple organs, including the heart and kidneys. In this study, we explored the protective roles of L-arginine in a mineralocorticoid-induced rat model of hypertension. To induce hypertension and subsequent organ damage, rats were nephrectomized unilaterally and fed with the mineralocorticoid fludrocortisone acetate and dietary salt (FCA-Salt). These rats were treated with L-arginine for 28 days, and subsequent tests were performed. Biochemical analysis revealed the increased level of inflammation and oxidative stress biomarkers in the plasma, heart, and kidney of the FCA-salt-treated rats. L-arginine treatment decreased the oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde (MDA) by 18 %, 22 %, and 18 % in the heart, kidney, and plasma, respectively. L-arginine also attenuated the advanced oxidative protein products (AOPP). The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) increased by 62 %, 45 %, and 16 % in the heart, kidney, and plasma, respectively, in the L-arginine-treated animals compared to the FCA-Salt group. Significant augmentation was also revealed for the nitric oxide (NO), catalase (CAT), and reduced glutathione (GSH). The plasma levels of the kidney function biomarkers uric acid and creatinine were significantly improved after L-arginine treatment. Furthermore, L-arginine remarkably reduced the elevated plasma cytokines IL-1β, IL-17A, TNF-α, and TGF-β1 in FCA-salt-induced hypertensive rats. Histopathological data showed a reduction in fibrosis and tissue damage by L-arginine in the FCA-salt-treated group. We propose that L-arginine could be an effective agent in preventing cardiac and renal dysfunction in hypertensive rats.",

      "abstract": "L-arginine limits proliferation in highly proliferative tissues. It is a substrate for nitric oxide synthases, arginases; its methylation by protein-L-arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) leads to asymmetric (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA). We measured L-arginine and its metabolites L-ornithine, L-citrulline, ADMA, and SDMA in a prospective cohort of 243 women with primary breast cancer (BC) and their associations with mortality and disease recurrence during 88 (IQR, 82-93) months of follow-up. We quantified these metabolites and expression of genes involved in L-arginine metabolic pathways in MCF-7, BT-474, SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 cells representing ER-positive, HER2-positive, and triple-negative BC compared to MCF-12 A cells. Plasma L-arginine and ADMA concentrations were elevated in 47 patients with recurrent disease and in 34 non-survivors. ADMA was significantly associated with mortality and recurrent disease in Luminal A patients; low L-citrulline was significantly associated with survival in triple-negative BC. In all BC cells except MCF-7, DDAH1 and DDAH2 expression was higher than in MCF-12 A (DDAH1: 32-44 fold, DDAH2: 1.7-4.2 fold; p < 0.05). By contrast, MCF-7 cells showed low DDAH1 and DDAH2, but high PRMT4 and PRMT6 expression and high L-arginine content. BT-474 and MDA-MB-468 cells showed high ARG2 expression and high L-ornithine concentrations, and MDA-MB-468 cells had the highest L-citrulline/L-arginine ratio. In conclusion, regulation of L-arginine metabolic pathways shows a complex and differential pattern between BC subtypes. ADMA is a prognostic biomarker in Luminal A patients; its metabolizing enzyme, DDAH, is highly overexpressed in BC cells. Thus, fingerprinting of L-arginine metabolism may offer novel personalized treatment options within BC subtypes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is significant interest in NO pathway modulators, specifically type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDE5is), to treat patients with a Fontan circulation. Trials, however, have had mixed results. The relationship between the NO pathway and clinical status in patients with Fontan circulation is a significant knowledge gap. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed targeted metabolomic analysis using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry to quantify plasma NO pathway metabolite concentrations from 2 well-characterized populations of patients with Fontan circulation: the Boston Adult Congenital Heart Disease Biobank and Fontan Udenafil Exercise Longitudinal studies. We investigated associations between NO metabolite concentrations and clinical outcomes, exercise capacity, and response to PDE5is. Increased plasma concentration of asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA), an inhibitor of NO production, was associated with risk for hospitalization or death. Increased ADMA and symmetric dimethyl arginine (another inhibitor of NO production) concentrations were associated with decreased baseline exercise capacity among patients with Fontan circulation with <90% predicted peak oxygen uptake, and change in ADMA and symmetric dimethyl arginine concentrations were predictive of change in exercise capacity over time. Treatment with the PDE5i udenafil uncoupled this association. Finally, baseline ADMA and symmetric dimethyl arginine concentrations predicted response to PDE5is among patients with subnormal peak oxygen uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma concentrations of metabolites that inhibit NO flux are associated with negative clinical outcomes and worse exercise capacity. Moreover, metabolite shifts over time associated with increased NO flux are associated with improved exercise capacity. In patients with a Fontan circulation, the NO pathway modulators ADMA and symmetric dimethyl arginine may be useful as biomarkers of clinical status and predictive of response to PDE5is.",

However, the molecular mechanism of airway dysfunction underlying OA has not yet been fully elucidated. The effects of microbiomes on arginine metabolism in relation to lung functions and a novel method for delivering arginine to lung tissue based on arginine-loaded red blood cell (RBC)-derived nanovesicles (NVs) (NVArg) will be investigated. Materials and Methods: Inflammatory status, amino acid profiles, and microbial diversity were evaluated in 20 adult patients with OA compared to 30 adult patients with non-OA (NOA) and 10 healthy control (HC) groups. Changes in gut or lung microbial composition that altered arginine metabolism in relation to airway inflammation were investigated in an OA mouse model in vivo. Additionally, this study evaluated the delivery of arginine to lung tissue utilizing NVArg in vivo and in vitro. Results: Significantly increased Bacteroides abundance but decreased serum arginine concentration with lower forced exhaled volume at 1 s (FEV1) (%) was noted in the OA group compared to the NOA and HC groups. In mouse experiments, when OA mice were given living bacteria from normal control (NC) mice, lung arginine concentration and airway resistance were restored. However, the administration of arginine or its metabolite (citrulline) did not increase the arginine levels in the lung tissues. We therefore created NVArg, which successfully delivered arginine into the cytoplasm of the airway epithelial cell line in vitro. Oral administration of NVArg for OA mice significantly induced the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) pathways in airway epithelial cells, which reduced airway resistance and inflammation. Conclusion: These findings suggest that microbiomes contribute to airway dysfunction by regulating arginine metabolism, whereas NVArg treatment may be a potential option for managing OA.",

Eliminating the proliferation of bacteria plays a crucial role in promoting the healing of diabetic wounds. Under near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation, l-arginine (L-Arg) -modified natural product puerarin (Pue)-derived carbon nanoparticles (l-Arg-CNP) not only exhibited excellent photothermal effects but also produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) to react with l-Arg for producing Nitric Oxide (NO), thus contributing to a synergistic antibacterial therapy in diabetic wound. At the same time, l-Arg-CNP retained Pue's original characteristics to promote cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Following the loading of l-Arg-CNP into microneedle patches (l-Arg-CNP@MN), it can deliver them into the deeper wound, effectively killing bacteria, reducing inflammatory infiltration, and promoting neovascularization at the wound site. It offers an effective therapeutic strategy for treating diabetic wound healing.",

METHODS: Huh7 and HepG2 cells treated with NaAsO2 were assessed for cell viability, pyroptosis, migration, and invasion after undergoing lentiviral transfection. An orthotopic liver tumor model was established and divided into a model group and a treatment group. Proteins associated with QRICH1, PRMT1, cGAS-STING, and the classical pyroptosis pathway were quantified using Western blotting. The intracellular expression and localization of PRMT1 and NLRP3 in HCC were analyzed through cellular immunofluorescence. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) was performed to examine the protein interactions between PRMT1 and cGAS, as well as between STING and NLRP3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was used to confirm QRICH1 enrichment in the PRMT1 promoter region. RESULTS: NaAsO2 treatment significantly inhibited the proliferation of Huh7 and HepG2 cells and effectively blocked their migration and invasion capabilities, while promoting cellular pyroptosis. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction(QRCR) and ChIP assays confirmed that NaAsO2 regulates PRMT1 expression by down-regulate QRICH1 binding in the PRMT1 promoter region. Additionally, NaAsO2 decreased the expression of the QRICH1-PRMT1 complex and upregulated the cGAS-STING signaling pathway, activating the downstream NLRP3-dependent classical pyroptosis pathway. Overexpression of QRICH1 reversed these effects. CONCLUSION: NaAsO2 inhibits the expression of the QRICH1-PRMT1 axis, activates cGAS-STING signaling pathway transduction, and induces pyroptosis in HCC cells, thereby increasing the infiltration of immune cells in liver cancer tissues."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a global health challenge. Arginine metabolism is central to immune responses, regulating nitric oxide (NO) production via inducible NO synthase (Nos2) and competing pathways mediated by arginases (Arg1 and Arg2). This study examines the impact of arginine supplementation and arginase inhibition during the acute phase of Mtb infection in mouse lungs, focusing on immune function, lung pathology, and mitochondrial function. Arginine supplementation enhanced Nos2 expression, promoted mitophagy, and supported angiogenesis and/or tissue repair by upregulating Vegfa. These mechanisms synergized to balance pro-inflammatory responses with tissue repair, improving immune defense while mitigating lung damage. In contrast, arginase inhibition disrupted Vegfa-mediated immune homeostasis, and impaired mitophagy, leading to exacerbated lung pathology. These findings underscore the complementary roles of Nos2 and arginase-mediated pathways in maintaining immune equilibrium during Mtb infection. Our results highlight arginine supplementation as a promising host-directed therapy for TB, capable of enhancing protective immunity and facilitating tissue repair. Conversely, caution is warranted for strategies targeting arginase due to potential adverse effects on inflammation resolution and mitochondrial quality control. Future studies should explore the long-term efficacy of arginine-based therapies and their integration with existing antibiotic regimens for optimal TB management.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) results from impaired hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal secretion of arginine vasopressin and leads to hypotonic polyuria and polydipsia. Common causes of arginine vasopressin deficiency include head trauma, pituitary surgery, neoplasms, and inflammatory stalk lesions; however, 25% to 50% of cases are idiopathic. Hypercalcemia can result in arginine vasopressin resistance (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus) and is an important differential in the evaluation of patients with hypotonic polyuria-polydipsia syndrome. CASE REPORT: A 32-year-old male presented with polyuria (24-hour urine output of 144 mL/kg), polydipsia (24-hour fluid intake of 130 mL/kg), and nocturia of 6 months' duration. Baseline investigations revealed normal liver, renal, serum potassium, and blood glucose levels. After overnight dehydration, serum osmolality increased to 317 mOsm/kg, while urine osmolality remained inappropriately low at 156 mOsm/kg. Mild hypercalcemia (serum calcium of 11.1 mg/dL) was noted. Upon arginine vasopressin challenge, urine osmolality increased by nearly 300%, suggesting complete arginine vasopressin deficiency. Evaluation for secondary causes was unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary revealed a normal anterior pituitary and pituitary stalk with an absent posterior pituitary bright spot. Idiopathic arginine vasopressin deficiency was diagnosed. The patient responded to oral desmopressin replacement, and normocalcemia was documented in multiple samples repeated when the patient was in a hydrated state. CONCLUSION: Patients with arginine vasopressin deficiency can manifest concomitant mild and reversible dehydration-related hypercalcemia. A brisk increase in urine osmolality following subcutaneous arginine vasopressin injection and normal serum calcium levels after desmopressin therapy can establish that hypercalcemia is the effect and not the cause of the primary disorder."

      "abstract": "The success of endodontic treatments can be significantly impaired by persistent microbial pathogens, especially Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) and Candida albicans (C. albicans). The aim of this study was to investigate how the incorporation of chitosan nanoparticles (CsNPs) and arginine (Arg) can enhance the antimicrobial and antibiofilm efficacy of AH Plus, a widely used epoxy resin-based root canal sealer. The CsNPs were synthesized by ionotropic gelation and assessed for their size, morphology, chemical structure, and cytotoxicity. The antimicrobial effectiveness of the modified sealers was evaluated against E. faecalis and C. albicans by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration, minimum bactericidal concentration, minimum fungicidal concentration, and agar diffusion method. Additionally, antibiofilm activity was assessed using a microtiter plate assay. Characterization of the CsNPs revealed an average size of 144 ± 12.8 nm by scanning electron microscopy and 182.4 nm by dynamic light scattering with a zeta capacitance of +49.2 mV. CsNPs maintained more than 68% cell viability at 625 μg/mL after 24 and 48 hours. Adding CsNPs and Arg significantly enhanced the impact of AH Plus sealer on antimicrobial and antibiofilm, especially at elevated additive concentrations. This study suggests that AH Plus sealers containing CsNPs and Arg may offer a promising approach to enhance endodontic treatment outcomes by efficiently combating resistant root canal infections."

      "abstract": "IgG4-related diseases are fibroinflammatory disorders affecting multiple organs, with autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) being a common manifestation. Steroid therapy is effective in inducing remission but has complex effects on glucose metabolism. Diabetes occurs in 40% to 80% of AIP patients, and steroids can worsen glucose tolerance, although some studies suggest they may improve pancreatic endocrine function. An 81-year-old man with elevated IgG4 levels and imaging findings consistent with AIP initially declined treatment. His condition worsened, leading to poor glycemic management and referral to our hospital. Imaging confirmed AIP and tests showed impaired insulin and glucagon secretion. He was diagnosed with pancreatic diabetes secondary to IgG4-related AIP. Initially, intensive insulin therapy was administered, but within 3 months, both insulin and glucagon secretion declined significantly in the arginine-stimulation test, necessitating steroid therapy with prednisolone (35 mg/day) for the AIP. The high dose of steroid treatment enhanced both insulin and glucagon secretion capacities but gradually declined with dose tapering. On the other hand, although steroid therapy poses a temporary risk of hyperglycemia, it likely prevented further deterioration of pancreatic endocrine function."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Arginine metabolism in tumors is often shunted into the pathway producing pro-tumor and immune suppressive polyamines (PAs), while downmodulating the alternative nitric oxide (NO) synthesis pathway. Aiming to correct arginine metabolism in tumors, arginine deprivation therapy and inhibitors of PA synthesis have been developed. Despite some therapeutic advantages, these approaches have often yielded severe side effects, making it necessary to explore an alternative strategy. We previously reported that supplementing sepiapterin (SEP), the endogenous precursor of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4, the essential NO synthase cofactor), could correct arginine metabolism in tumor cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and induce their metabolic and phenotypic reprogramming. We saw that oral SEP treatment effectively suppressed the growth of HER2-positive mammary tumors in animals. SEP also has no reported dose-dependent toxicity in clinical trials for metabolic disorders. In the present study, we tested our hypothesis that a long-term administration of SEP to individuals susceptible to HER2-positive mammary tumor would protect them against tumor occurrence. METHODS: We administered SEP, in comparison to control DMSO, to MMTV-neu mice susceptible to HER2-positive mammary tumors for 8 months starting at their pre-pubertal stage. We monitored tumor onsets to determine the rate of tumor-free survival. After 8 months of treatment, we grouped animals into DMSO treatment with or without tumors and SEP treatment with or without tumors. We analyzed blood metabolites, PBMC, and bone marrow of DMSO vs. SEP treated animals. RESULTS: We found that a long-term use of SEP in animals susceptible to HER2-positive mammary tumors effectively suppressed tumor occurrence. These SEP-treated animals had undergone reprogramming of the systemic metabolism and immunity, elevating total T cell counts in the circulation and bone marrow. Given that bone marrow-resident T cells are mostly memory T cells, it is plausible that chronic SEP treatment promoted memory T cell formation, leading to a potent tumor prevention. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the possible roles of the SEP/BH4/NO axis in promoting memory T cell formation and its potential therapeutic utility for preventing HER2-positive breast cancer."

One of the first clinical signs in patients with COPD is reduced physical ability, which is usually attributed to reduced lung function, although a significant role is played by a disorder of the musculoskeletal system. The aim of the study was to examine differences in fitness and locomotor status between smokers and non-smokers, as well as the effect of oral administration of L-arginine on the strength of the quadriceps depending on smoking status. The study included 164 subjects, 84 non-smokers and 81 smokers not diagnosed with COPD. All subjects completed CAT and IPAQ questionnaires, and performed spirometry, 6-minute walking test and quadriceps strength testing without therapy and after oral administration of 500 mg L-arginine. The results showed that the increase in quadriceps strength after oral administration of L-arginine was not dependent on smoking status but was more pronounced in smokers who started smoking at an earlier age and who smoked more cigarettes, as well as a generally higher physical activity of non-smokers. These results could become relevant for recognizing the development of skeletal musculature hypotonus and hypotrophy in smokers who are prone to develop COPD.",

      "abstract": "Keloid is characterised by the reprogramming of cellular metabolism, wherein keloid cells adapt their metabolic pathways to meet the demands for energy and biosynthetic precursors. Investigating the intricate relationship between cellular metabolism and the biological behaviour of keloid holds the potential to yield novel therapeutic strategies for keloid. To elucidate the molecular alterations and potential underlying regulatory mechanisms in keloids, we created comprehensive metabolic profiling at the pathway level by analysing metabolomic, transcriptomic and single-cell RNA-sequencing data from keloids and adjacent skin. Viability assay and clonogenic assay were performed to validate the function of the metabolic pathway(s) in primary keloid fibroblast cells. Integrated analysis revealed an upregulation of arginine and proline metabolism in keloids. According to single-cell RNA-seq data, elevated expression of genes related to arginine and proline metabolism, such as P4HA3, P4HA2, P4HA1, PYCR1, OAT and ASS1, was predominately highly expressed in fibroblast-2. Fibroblast-2 displayed more obvious phenotypes of mesenchymal fibroblast. Critical genes from integrated analysis including P4HA3, P4HA2, P4HA1, PYCR1 and AZIN2, and metabolites including fumaric acid and 2-oxo-5-amino-pentanoic acid showed prognostic relevance with disease-free survival of keloid. Additionally, an In vitro study showed that arginine deprivation therapy (ADT) inhibited and radiosensitised the proliferation of keloid-derived fibroblasts. In conclusion, our thorough multiomics study deepens our understanding of the link between arginine and proline metabolism and keloid proliferation and radiosensitivity. Elevated activity of arginine and proline metabolism in mesenchymal fibroblasts may be a potential therapeutic pathway for keloid.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The emergence of immunotherapy has revolutionized the paradigm of cancer treatment with immune checkpoint blockades (ICB) in solid cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, only a small subset of CRC patients harboring deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) benefits from ICB therapy. A very limited response to ICB therapy has been achieved in MMR-proficient CRC, representing a significant challenge limiting the clinical application of immunotherapy. MMR is the critical DNA repair pathway that maintains genomic integrity by correcting DNA mismatches, which is mediated by the MutSα or MutSβ complex consisting of MSH2 with MSH6 and MSH3, respectively. Given that MMR status directs effective immune response, we sought to determine whether targeting MMR capacity boosts ICB efficacy. METHODS: Azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS)-induced CRC and xenograft model were used to evaluate the function of PRMT6 and response to PRMT6 inhibitor EPZ020411 and combination therapy of PD1 and EPZ020411. Biochemical assays were performed to elucidate the underlying mechanism of PRMT6-mediated MSH2 methylation and immune evasion. RESULTS: We have identified PRMT6 as a crucial regulator of MMR capacity via MSH2 dimethylation at R171 and R219. Such a modification abrogates its MMR capacity and prevents the recruitment of MSH3 and MSH6. PRMT6 loss or inhibition triggers cytosolic DNA accumulation and cGAS-STING signaling activation, leading to enhanced immune response in PRMT6-deficient colon tumors or xenografts. Pharmacological inhibition of PRMT6 using EPZ020411 promotes mutagenesis and destabilizes MutSα or MutSβ assembly, and prolonged EPZ020411 exposure maintains an MSI-like phenotype in microsatellite stability (MSS) cells. EPZ020411 treatment sensitizes ICB efficacy of MSS cells, but not MSI cells in vivo. Similar effects have been observed in MSS colon tumors induced by AOM/DSS. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a preclinical proof of concept to overcome resistance to immunotherapy by targeting PRMT6 in CRC with MSS.",

This study introduces a novel antifungal agent such as Curcumin@Graphene Oxide/Chitosan/Arginine nanocomposite hydrogel (Cur@GO/CS/Arg), targeting Candida albicans, a primary cause of periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs). The hydrogel exhibited remarkable antifungal efficacy, characterized by a 17 mm inhibition zone, a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1.25 mg/ml, and a minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of 2.5 mg/ml, confirming its fungicidal properties based on the tolerance ratio. Additionally, it significantly reduced biofilm formation, highlighting its potent antifungal action. Furthermore, it demonstrated excellent biosafety, as evidenced by a minimal hemolytic effect at 50 μg/ml. These findings underscore the synergistic interactions among curcumin, graphene oxide, chitosan, and arginine, which enhance antifungal activity. This study offers a promising strategy for managing Candida albicans-associated PJIs, enabling safer and more effective treatment."

      "abstract": "We previously observed elevated plasma levels of citrulline and arginine in diabetic retinopathy patients compared to diabetic controls. We tested our hypothesis that citrulline plus arginine induces angiogenesis and increases permeability in retinal endothelial cells. Human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) were treated with citrulline, arginine, or citrulline + arginine, and angiogenesis was measured with cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation assays. Permeability was measured in HRMEC monolayers via trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and FITC-labeled dextran. We also measured arginase activity, arginase-1 and arginase-2 expression, protein expression and phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and nitric oxide (NO) production. Citrulline + arginine induced endothelial cell proliferation (p = 0.018), migration (p = 0.011), and tube formation (p = 0.0042). Citrulline + arginine also increased FITC-dextran flow-through (p = 1.5 × 10-5) and decreased TEER (p = 0.010). Citrulline + arginine had no effect on arginase activity, but it increased eNOS (p = 6.3 × 10-4) and phosphorylated eNOS (p = 0.029), as well as NO production (p = 0.025). Inhibiting eNOS prevented the increase in NO (p = 0.0092), inhibited citrulline + arginine-induced cell migration (p = 0.0080) and tube formation (p = 0.0092), and blocked citrulline + arginine-related alterations in FITC-dextran flow-through (p = 3.6 × 10-4) and TEER (p = 3.9 × 10-4). These data suggest that citrulline + arginine treatment induces angiogenesis and increases permeability in retinal endothelial cells by activating eNOS and increasing NO production.",

We analyzed prevalence, genetic, biochemical, and pituitary imaging features associated with arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D), one of the most common endocrinopathies in ECD. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study of 61 subjects with ECD was conducted at a clinical research center from January 2011 to December 2018, with molecular genetics, baseline biochemical and pituitary endocrine function studies, and dedicated pituitary MRI (or CT) studies. AVP-D and anterior pituitary endocrinopathies (hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, adrenal insufficiency and panhypopituitarism) were assessed. Students' t-tests, nonparametric tests, Fisher's exact tests, and logistic regression were employed for analysis. RESULTS: In total, 22 out of 61 subjects (36%; 19 males and 3 females) had AVP-D; 18 subjects with AVP-D were in active treatment with desmopressin. Those with versus without AVP-D were younger [mean (±SD): 50.00 (±10.45) vs. 56.72 (±10.45) years], had higher prevalence of BRAF V600E pathogenic variants [68% vs. 43%], lower IGF-1 [mean (±SD): 137.05 (±67.97) vs. 175.92 (±61.89) ng/mL], lower urine osmolality [416.00 (250.00-690.00) vs. 644.50 (538.75-757.75)) mOsm/kg], and a higher burden of central hypogonadism [81.82% vs. 36.00%], central hypothyroidism [23% vs. 2.5%], panhypopituitarism [41% vs. 0%], anterior pituitary endocrine deficits, absent posterior pituitary bright spots [63.64% vs. 20.51%], and abnormal pituitary imaging. In adjusted models, [OR (95%CI)] BRAF V600E mutation [7.38 (1.84-39.01)], central hypogonadism [6.193 (1.44-34.80)], primary hypothyroidism [13.89 (1.401-406.5)], absent posterior pituitary bright spot [12.84 (3.275-65.04)], and abnormal pituitary imaging [10.60 (2.844-48.29)] were associated with higher odds of having AVP-D. CONCLUSIONS: AVP-D is common in ECD and accompanied by a higher burden of pituitary endocrinopathies, BRAF V600E pathogenic variants, abnormal pituitary imaging, and absent posterior pituitary bright spots."

Therefore, scavenging ROS to alleviate inflammation and promote bone regeneration are promising strategies to treat periodontitis. In this study, L-arginine (L-Arg) was used to modify mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG), forming L-Arg modified MBG (MBG@L-Arg), which showed effective ROS-scavenging and NO release properties in cells, and realize the protection and restoration of cell's activity in ROS-rich microenvironment. Furthermore, MBG@L-Arg can induce macrophage polarization from M1 to M2 phenotype, and promote the osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells and human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs). MBG@L-Arg also regulated anti-inflammatory and antioxidant systems by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway and activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Besides, NO-PKG signaling pathway was also activated, further promoting bone regeneration. The in vivo results demonstrated that MBG@L-Arg can efficiently inhibit inflammation-induced tissue destruction and promote osteogenesis regeneration. The quantitative bone loss in MBG@L-Arg group was 1.03 ± 0.05 mm, significantly lower than that of the periodontitis group (1.47 ± 0.13 mm), implying that MBG@L-Arg can work as multifunctional materials for periodontal tissue regeneration."

      "abstract": "The activation of ferroptosis has shown great potential for cancer therapy from an unconventional perspective, but revealing the mechanisms underlying the suppression of tumour-intrinsic ferroptosis to promote tumorigenesis remains a challenging task. Here we report that methionine is metabolized into S-adenosylmethionine, which functions as a methyl-group donor to trigger symmetric dimethylation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) at the conserved arginine 152 (R152) residue, along with a prolonged GPX4 half-life. Inhibition of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), which catalyses GPX4 methylation, decreases GPX4 protein levels by impeding GPX4 methylation and increasing ferroptosis inducer sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. This methylation prevents Cullin1-FBW7 E3 ligase binding to GPX4, thereby abrogating the ubiquitination-mediated GPX4 degradation. Notably, combining PRMT5 inhibitor treatment with ferroptotic therapies markedly suppresses tumour progression in mouse tumour models. In addition, the levels of GPX4 are negatively correlated with the levels of FBW7 and a poor prognosis in patients with human carcinoma. In summary, we found that PRMT5 functions as a target for improving cancer therapy efficacy, by acting to reduce the counteraction of ferroptosis by tumour cells by means of PRMT5-enhanced GPX4 stability.",

      "abstract": "Arginine plays a critical role in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. We find that arginine catabolism is reduced in the intestinal microbiota of patients with CRC but increased in tumor tissue. We further verify that Escherichia coli can consume arginine via the arginine succinyltransferase (AST) pathway, and gavaging mice with the AST-deficient E. coli Nissle 1917 (ΔacEcN) can inhibit arginine catabolism of the intestinal microbiota, thereby increasing the arginine concentration in the colon. In the azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced CRC mouse model, reduced arginine catabolism in the intestinal microbiota increases the arginine concentration in the tumor microenvironment, thereby activating the nitric oxide (NO) synthesis pathway and polyamine synthesis pathway in tumor tissues, stimulating angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment, inducing M2 macrophage polarization, and activating the Wingless/Integrated (Wnt)/β-catenin pathway, ultimately accelerating CRC progression. This study reveals that intestinal microbiota can affect CRC progression through arginine catabolism, providing a potential target for the prevention and therapy of CRC.",

      "abstract": "Chronic pancreatitis (CP), a progressive inflammatory disease characterized by pancreatic tissue destruction and fibrosis, is considered a challenging health burden due to insufficiencies of current management procedures. Autophagy impairment has emerged as a major triggering event in pancreatitis, raising interest in exploring the potential of targeting autophagy as a possible interventional strategy. This study aimed to evaluate the possible ameliorative effect of two autophagy modulators, simvastatin and eugenol, on CP-related perturbations in an arginine-induced rat model. Repeated l-arginine administration (5 g/kg divided into 2 doses with a 1 h interval, given intraperitoneally every 3rd day for a total of 10 times) provoked CP features, demonstrated by acinar damage, oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis. Arginine-triggered pancreatitis was accompanied by hampered pancreatic autophagic flux, evidenced by overexpression of pancreatic p62 and LC3-Ⅱ and downregulation of pancreatic AMPK and LAMP-1 mRNA expression. Treatment with simvastatin (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally 24 h, before each arginine dose) and eugenol (50 mg/kg/day orally for 30 days) achieved significant anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic effects, and reversed the arginine-instigated autophagic blockade, with superior ameliorative effects attained by eugenol. Altogether, simvastatin and eugenol provide a promising interventional approach for CP, at least partly, by restoring the impaired autophagic flux associated with CP.",

We here investigated the effects of exogenous L-arginine on cardiac pathology and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and dynamics in DahlS.Z-Leprfa/Leprfa (DS/obese) rats, a model of metabolic syndrome (MetS). DS/obese rats and their lean homozygous littermate (DahlS.Z-Lepr+/Lepr+, or DS/lean) controls were provided with drinking water containing 0.50% L-arginine-HCl or 0.85% L-alanine (isonitrogenous control) from 13 to 17 weeks of age. L-Arginine supplementation markedly alleviated hypertension without affecting cardiac injury in MetS rats. It also attenuated the increase in ROS production apparent in cardiac mitochondria isolated from MetS rats as well as suppressed the associated upregulation of Nox4 mRNA and protein in the heart. Furthermore, L-arginine reversed the decrease in the size of cardiac mitochondria as well as changes in the expression of DRP1 and OPA1 proteins apparent in the L-alanine-treated MetS rat heart. Cardiac arginase II gene expression and arginase activity were increased by L-arginine treatment in MetS rats but not CONT rats. L-Arginine supplementation thus ameliorated hypertension and cardiac mitochondrial abnormalities in MetS rats, with the lack of a cardioprotective effect possibly being due to increased arginase activity.",

      "abstract": "Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) is an enzyme that modifies proteins by converting positively charged arginine residues to neutral citrulline residues. This process, termed citrullination, has been known to trigger NETosis, a neutrophil cell death pathway involving the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Abnormal PAD4 activity and protein citrullination have been linked to various diseases, including those affecting the central nervous system. Herein we investigated the profile of PAD4 expression in an animal model of stroke induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). PAD4 levels were significantly elevated in the ischemic core and penumbra of the affected hemisphere at 3-6 and 6-48 h post-MCAO, respectively. Notably, NETosis induction, indicated by the upregulation of CitH3 (citrullinated histone H3, a NETosis marker), was observed between 48 and 96 h post-MCAO, peaking at 96 h. While PAD4 was present in most brain cell types of sham controls, strong PAD4 induction was primarily observed in neurons during the peak PAD4 induction period (12-24 h post-MCAO). Importantly, intranasal administration of the PAD4 inhibitor BB-Cl-amidine (BBCA) significantly reduced infarct volume and improved neurological and functional outcomes at 24 h post-MCAO, demonstrating a strong protective effect of PAD4 inhibition in ischemic stroke. Staining with an antibody that recognizing citrullinated proteins (F95) revealed an accumulation of these proteins, especially degenerating neurons, however, BBCA treatment significantly suppressed this accumulation in dying neurons. These findings indicate that PAD4-mediated protein citrullination in neurons plays a critical role in promoting ischemic brain damage. Furthermore, delayed administration of BBCA (at 48/72 h post-MCAO) suppresses the NETosis induction observed at 96 h post-MCAO, potentially ameliorating repair processes such as blood vessel regeneration. Collectively, these findings suggest a complex role of PAD4 in cerebral ischemia, with neuroprotective effects (NETosis-independent function) during the acute to subacute period and NETosis-suppressive effects at later time points.",

      "abstract": "l-Amino acid oxidases (LAAO) deaminate amino acids to α-keto acids and generate hydrogen peroxide, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) with potential value for cancer therapy. We recombinantly expressed the LAAO from Aplysia punctata, called APIT (Cuvier 1803). The resulting wild-type APIT (APITwt) was conjugated to polyethylene glycol (APIT-PEG). Furthermore, an APIT mutant with an affibody targeting the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; zHER2-APIT) was genetically engineered resulting in a binding affinity KD of ∼ 2.2 nM to the HER2 receptor ectodomain. Further, we evaluated if the APIT and tumor-targeted APIT can be used as an APIT-drug conjugate by covalently amidating the lysine residues on the protein surface. However, for the HER2-targeted APIT, the affibody contains lysines as well, and amidation of these lysines could have impaired the affibody's affinity to the HER2 receptor. Therefore, we designed a lysine-free variant of the tumor-targeting part of zHER2-APIT using an in silico mutation analysis, suggesting the replacement of the lysines of the affibody by arginine or alanine. This new variant is referred to as zHER2(K-del)-APIT. To simulate a covalent drug loading to APIT and the targeting constructs, we attached biotin by amidation. Biotin-zHER2(K-del)-APIT successfully allowed binding to HER2-positive but not HER2-negative cells in vitro. The biodistribution of these novel constructs was tested in xenografted mice with a HER2-positive and negative tumor in each animal. The zHER2(K-del)-APIT lost its ability to target HER2-positive tumors despite the in vitro data suggesting otherwise. The zHER2-APIT accumulated within the HER2-positive tumors but not in the negative tumors. APIT-PEG had increased uptake in HER2-positive and negative tumors compared to APITwt, which can be attributed to a prolonged serum half-life achieved by PEGylation, due to the absence of any tumor-targeting effect. These biodistribution studies point to HER2-targeting LAAOs for cancer therapy and PEGylation increasing tumor accumulation.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Sepsis-induced lung injury represents a clinical syndrome encompassing various forms of acute respiratory failure. Understanding the mechanisms underlying its development is critical for identifying promising therapeutic targets. METHODS: In this study, both in vitro and in vivo models of septic lung injury were established using a mouse model and the human lung microvascular endothelial cell line HULEC-5a. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting were utilized to measure messenger RNA and protein expression levels. Flow cytometry was employed to assess pyroptosis, and coimmunoprecipitation was used to detect protein-protein interactions. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to evaluate the pathological changes in lung tissues. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that Sirtuin 5 expression was significantly downregulated in the blood of patients with septic lung injury, as well as in mice and HULEC-5a cells treated with lipopolysaccharide. SIRT5 suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced pyroptosis in HULEC-5a cells and septic lung injury in mice. Mechanistically, SIRT5 was shown to directly bind to Serine-Arginine Protein Kinase 1 (SRPK1) and desuccinylate it at lysine residues K588 and K598, thereby reducing its protein stability. Rescue experiments further confirmed that SIRT5 exerts its protective effects against septic lung injury through regulation of SRPK1. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings suggested that the SIRT5/SRPK1 signaling pathway may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of septic lung injury.",

Following bonding and composite build-up procedures, each group was subdivided into; the non-aged subgroup, where the μTBS was measured immediately, and the aged subgroup, where the specimens were thermo-cycled before μTBS. Resin-dentin sticks were prepared for μTBS testing. The failure mode distribution was analyzed. The resin-dentin interface was investigated using Field-emission scanning electron microscopy. A two-way ANOVA was utilized, followed by Tukey's post hoc test. Results before thermo-cycling, group 1 had the highest μTBS mean value followed by groups 2 and 4 without a significant difference.

METHODS: 7 healthy, mixed hound dogs were nausea scored using videotaped observations, and concentrations of ACTH, cortisol, AVP, ghrelin, 5-HIAA, and SP were measured in blood at baseline, after 0.5 mg/kg, IM, morphine administration, and following administration of the treatment drug. Data collection occurred from October 20 through November 24, 2023. Treatments were saline 0.1 mL/kg (S) and propofol 0.5 mg/kg (P1), 1.0 mg/kg (P2), and 1.5 mg/kg (P3) administered IV 20 minutes after morphine administration using a randomized, crossover design with a 7-day washout between treatments. RESULTS: Nausea scores increased at 5 minutes and over time in all treatments. Adrenocorticotropic hormone concentrations were lower in P2 versus P1, P2 versus S, and P3 versus S at the 50-minute time point. At 50 minutes, cortisol concentrations were lower in P3 versus S, P2 versus S, and P3 versus P1. There were no statistically significant differences in AVP, ghrelin, 5-HIAA, or SP concentrations between treatments or over time. CONCLUSIONS: AVP, ghrelin, 5-HIAA, and SP did not correlate with nausea signs in dogs. Additionally, propofol, at the subhypnotic doses administered, did not significantly decrease signs of nausea.

Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent way of cell death associated with abnormal intracellular lipid metabolism. Celastrol (Cel) has the ability to inhibit the progression of HCC by regulating multiple signaling pathways and induce ferroptosis. However, Cel exists the limitations of low water solubility, low oral bioavailability, and high organ toxicity. Cel was encapsulated in polyethylene glycol-based liposomes modified with L-arginine (Cel@Lip-Arg). Cel@Lip-Arg has a uniform size distribution (∼100 nm), high drug loading (80 %), and excellent ability to target liver cancer cells. In vitro experiments demonstrated that Cel@Lip-Arg considerably suppressed the activity of HuH7 (hepatoma) cells but had a negligible effect on L02 (normal) cells. Cel@Lip-Arg induced ferroptosis in hepatoma cells by promoting transferrin receptor expression, inhibiting system xc- and glutathione peroxidase 4, and favoring intracellular peroxide accumulation. In vivo experiments revealed that Cel@Lip-Arg plays a therapeutic role by inducing ferroptosis. Compared to Cel, Cel@Lip-Arg had a higher anti-hepatoma activity and effectively reduced the toxicity of Cel in mice. Cel@Lip-Arg-induced ferroptosis was concluded to be an attractive strategy for the precise treatment of HCC.",

Due to their significant roles in these processes, PRMTs have emerged as promising therapeutic targets in cancer. Among all cancer types, breast cancer has been the most extensively studied in relation to PRMTs dysregulation. Previous studies have reported that several PRMTs are overexpressed in breast cancer and play critical roles in tumor growth, metastasis, and the maintenance of breast cancer stem cells. Moreover, an increasing number of PRMT inhibitors are undergoing clinical trials for breast cancer treatment, demonstrating significant progress. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the biological functions of PRMTs in breast cancer and to summarize the latest clinical developments of PRMT inhibitors for cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) poses a significant threat to global public health, prompting the exploration of alternative strategies to mitigate its virulence. This study investigates the impact of subminimum inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of rifampicin on MRSA virulence, aiming to provide insights for optimizing antibiotic treatment strategies. METHODS: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blot analysis were used to assess α-hemolysin expression. Transcriptomic sequencing and RT-qPCR analyzed gene expression changes in MRSA treated with sub-MICs of rifampicin. Mutant strains (ΔsaeR and ΔargGH) were constructed to validate the roles of the SaeRS system and arginine metabolism. Thermal shift assays evaluated the interaction between L-arginine and SaeR protein. In vivo murine models and Galleria mellonella infection models were used to assess the anti-virulence effects of rifampicin. RESULTS: Our findings reveal that sub-MICs of rifampicin significantly reduce the expression of MRSA α-hemolysin. Transcriptomic sequencing and RT-qPCR analysis suggest a dual-pathway mechanism, wherein rifampicin suppresses virulence by indirectly inhibiting the SaeRS two-component system and disrupting arginine metabolism-related pathways. The construction of a saeR knockout mutant (ΔsaeR) and an arginine biosynthesis deficient mutant (ΔargGH) further supports this mechanism. Notably, exogenous l-arginine supplementation reverses rifampicin's inhibitory effect on α-hemolysin expression, underscoring the pivotal role of l-arginine metabolism in MRSA virulence regulation. Thermal shift assays demonstrate a direct interaction between l-arginine and SaeR protein, elucidating the intricate interplay between metabolic pathways and virulence regulation. In vivo studies confirm that sub-MICs of rifampicin attenuate the severity of skin abscesses in a murine model, improve survival rates in bloodstream infection models, and mitigate inflammation in both skin and lung tissues. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential of rifampicin as an anti-virulence agent and pave the way for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies targeting MRSA infections.",

Pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 offers a promising treatment strategy for inflammatory conditions, although no medications targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome are currently available. This study demonstrates that clioquinol (CQ), a clinical drug with chelating properties, effectively inhibits NLRP3 activation, resulting in reduced cytokine secretion and cell pyroptosis in both human and mouse macrophages, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.478 μM. Additionally, CQ mitigates experimental acute peritonitis, gouty arthritis, sepsis, and colitis by lowering serum levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Mechanistically, CQ covalently binds to Arginine 335 (R335) in the NACHT domain, inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and blocking the interaction between NLRP3 and its component protein. Collectively, this study identifies CQ as an effective natural NLRP3 inhibitor and a potential therapeutic agent for NLRP3-driven diseases."

Previous studies indicated that GLS2 plays a key role in promoting ferroptosis. However, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show, there were elevated ferroptosis and increased expression levels of protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), early growth response 1 (EGR1), and glutaminase 2 (GLS2) in both in vitro and in vivo ALI models. Additionally, EGR1 was found to induce the transcription of GLS2, thereby promoting ferroptosis. We also discovered that the protein level of EGR1 was increased through enhanced stability, facilitated by PRMT1-mediated arginine methylation, and reduced ubiquitination degradation regulated by neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 4 like (NEDD4L). The in vivo results confirmed that the knockdown of PRMT1 suppressed ferroptosis via the EGR1/GLS2 axis. Our findings suggest that PRMT1-mediated stabilization of EGR1 promoted sepsis induced ALI via GLS2, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting PRMT1 or EGR1 in the treatment of sepsis-induced ALI.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1) silencing in carcinomas and sarcomas leads to a dependence on extracellular arginine for survival. Arginine deprivation therapies, such as PEGylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20), have shown limited effectiveness, which may be due to underlying mechanisms that inhibit apoptosis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The effects of ADI-PEG20 on cell-cycle regulation, apoptosis, and BCL-XL-mediated survival pathways in ASS1-deficient cancer cells were determined. The mechanism of cell death protection was determined by assessing caspase and PARP cleavage, CDK2 activity, MCL1 expression, and the interactions among BCL-XL, BAX, and BAK. In vitro synergy was determined, and in vivo efficacy was modeled. RESULTS: Treatment with ADI-PEG20 led to reduced CDK2 activity and inhibited cell-cycle progression but did not induce significant cell death. BCL-XL was found to bind to BAX and BAK, preventing the initiation of apoptosis despite arginine starvation. Inhibition of BCL-XL allowed proapoptotic BAX and BAK to initiate the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, leading to increased cell death. This was found to be synergistic in vitro and efficacious in combination in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: The study identifies BCL-XL as a key factor limiting the efficacy of arginine starvation therapies. Combining BCL-XL inhibitors with arginine deprivation strategies may overcome this resistance and enhance therapeutic outcomes. These findings provide a strong preclinical rationale for testing this combination approach in phase 1 clinical trials for ASS1-deficient cancers.",

In this study, we report the discovery of ionic arginine-rich peptides to disrupt the pathogenic galectin-10 (gal-10) crystallization, where the aberrant deposition of gal-10 crystals in airways causes the activation of IL-1β-dependent inflammation and the stimulation of epithelial cells to produce TNF-α. Gal-10 crystals show susceptibility to pH changes and charged residue substitutions at the protein packing interfaces, manifesting the role of charge-charge attractions across protein-protein interaction interfaces in governing gal-10 crystallization. To dissolve the gal-10 crystal, the ionic peptides R9 and R12Y8 were identified to eliminate the interprotein charge-charge interactions. The efficacy of R12Y8 in mitigating the gal-10 crystallopathy in vivo was assessed in a crystal-induced lung inflammation mice model. The mice intratracheally administrated by R12Y8 exhibited a downregulated release of proinflammatory cytokines and reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lungs. Our study demonstrates that the pathogenic gal-10 crystallization is readily eliminated by R-rich peptides, which may display translational potentials for the treatment of gal-10 crystallopathy.",

In this study, PR20 was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) to track its cellular localization. Several cell lines demonstrated survival under PR20 treatment by sequestering PR20 in the cytoplasm. Treatment with JQ-1 or Ivermectin (Iver) translocated PR20 into the nucleus, leading to cell death. Mechanistically, KPNA2/KPNB1 interacted with PR20 in the cytoplasm and hindered PR20 from entering the cell nucleus. Genetic silencing of KPNA2/KPNB1 converted PR20-resistant cells into PR20-sensitive cells. Treatment with JQ1 significantly reduced the protein levels of KPNA2/KPNB1, allowing PR20 to enter the nucleus. Overexpression of KPNA2 or KPNB1 effectively blocked cell death induced by co-treatment with JQ-1 and PR20.

Empirical evidence indicates that the metabolic processes of cancerous and healthy cells can significantly impact immune responses and the fate of tumors. Arginine, a multifaceted amino acid, assumes a crucial and paradoxical role in various metabolic pathways, as certain tumors exhibit arginine auxotrophy while others do not. Notably, CRC is classified as arginine non-auxotrophic, possessing the ability to synthesize arginine from citrulline. Systemic arginine deprivation and the inhibition of arginine uptake represent two prevalent therapeutic strategies in oncological treatment. However, given the divergent behaviors of tumors concerning the metabolism and synthesis of arginine, one of these therapeutic approaches-namely systemic arginine deprivation-does not apply to CRC. This review elucidates the characteristics of arginine uptake inhibition and systemic arginine deprivation alongside their respective benefits and limitations in CRC. Furthermore, the involvement of arginine in immunotherapeutic strategies is examined in light of the most recent discoveries on various human malignancies.",

In contrast, mice supplemented with oyster powder demonstrated elevated numbers of immune cells in the spleen and small intestine, as well as enhanced serum production of IL-1β, IL-2, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. Furthermore, oyster consumption improved the composition of the gut microbiota by promoting beneficial bacteria and inhibiting harmful ones.

      "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the effects of different arginine (Arg) to lysine (Lys) ratios on feed intake, nutrient digestibility, growth performance, carcass characteristics, and antibody titers of Newcastle disease (ND) and infectious bronchitis (IB) disease in broilers during 35 days of trial. For this purpose, a total of 816 day-old broiler birds having an average weight of 38 ± 3 g were divided into six dietary treatments in such a way that each treatment had eight replicates and each replicate had 17 birds. The treatments were 0.95 (1.19/1.25, 1.12/1.18, and 1.05/1.1), 1 (1.25/1.25, 1.18/1.18, and 1.1/1.1), 1.05 (1.31/1.25, 1.24/1.18, and 1.17/1.1), 1.10 (1.38/1.25, 1.30/1.18, and 1.23/1.1), 1.15 (1.44/1.25, 1.36/1.18, and 1.28/1.1), and 1.20 (1.50/1.25, 1.42/1.18, and 1.34/1.1) Arg/Lys divided into different amounts according to the nutritional needs of starter, grower, and finisher diets, respectively. The results showed that in the finisher phase, the FI was influenced cubically, while in the overall period, a quadratic effect was observed for the FI (p < 0.05). The results of BWG showed that BWG was linearly increased in birds given different Arg/Lys in the grower, finisher, and overall period (p < 0.05). The results also showed that during the grower, finisher, and overall phases, the body weight gain (BWG) was better in birds fed with 1.05 and 1.10 Arg/Lys (p < 0.05). Furthermore, a better feed conversion ratio (FCR) was shown in the starter and grower phases at 1.10 and 1.15 Arg/Lys (p < 0.05). The results of nutrient digestibility explored showed that the experimental treatments had a better effect (p < 0.05) on dry matter and crude fat digestibility in birds fed with 1.19/1.25, 1.12/1.18, and 1.05/1.1 and 1.25/1.25, 1.18/1.18, and 1.1/1.1 Arg/Lys in their diets while the crude protein digestibility remained unaffected with different treatments (p > 0.05). The treatments had no effect (p > 0.05) on relative organ weights, immune organs, and carcass characteristics. However, higher titers of ND and IBD were observed in birds fed with Arg/Lys of 1.38/1.25, 1.30/1.18, and 1.23/1.1 and 1.50/1.25, 1.42/1.18, and 1.34/1.1 in their diets (p < 0.05). Based on the results of the current study, it is concluded that the inclusion levels of 1.38/1.25, 1.30/1.18, and 1.23/1.1, and 1.44/1.25, 1.36/1.18, and 1.28/1.1 Arg/Lys resulted in better growth performance and immune response in the broiler birds, respectively. Therefore, adjusting the levels of Arg/Lys in feed is recommended to enhance broilers' growth performance and immune response."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The role of α-synuclein (α-syn) pathology in Parkinson's disease (PD) is well established; however, effective therapies remain elusive. Two mechanisms central to PD neurodegeneration are the intracellular aggregation of misfolded α-syn and the uptake of α-syn aggregates into neurons. Cationic arginine-rich peptides (CARPs) are an emerging class of molecule with multiple neuroprotective mechanisms of action, including protein stabilisation. This study characterised both intracellular α-syn aggregation and α-syn uptake in cortical neurons in vitro. Thereafter, this study examined the therapeutic potential of the neuroprotective CARP, R18D (18-mer of D-arginine), to prevent the aforementioned PD pathogenic processes through a cell-free thioflavin-T (ThT) assay and in cortical neurons. METHODS: To induce intracellular α-syn aggregation, rat primary cortical neurons were exposed to α-syn seed (0.14 μM) for 2 h to allow uptake of the protein, followed by R18D treatment (0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 μM), and a subsequent measurement of α-syn aggregates 48 h later using a homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay. To assess neuronal uptake, α-syn seeds were covalently labelled with an Alexa-Fluor 488 fluorescent tag, pre-incubated with R18D (0.125, 0.25, 0.5 μM), and then exposed to cortical neurons for 24 h and assessed via confocal microscopy. RESULTS: It was demonstrated that R18D significantly reduced both intracellular α-syn aggregation and α-syn seed uptake in neurons by 37.8% and 77.7%, respectively. Also, R18D reduced the aggregation of α-syn monomers in the cell-free assay. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of R18D to inhibit key α-syn pathological processes and PD progression."

      "abstract": "The amino acid l-arginine (Arg) plays important roles in multiple metabolic and physiological processes, and changes in its concentration have been implicated in pathological processes. While it is important to measure Arg levels in biological systems directly and in real-time, existing Arg sensors respond to l-ornithine or l-lysine. Here we report ArgS1, a new Arg sensor. It showed a concentration-dependent increase in the ratio Ex488/405 for Arg with an apparent affinity of ∼64 μM and with a dynamic range (ΔR/R0) of 3. ArgS1 responds to Arg in both the cytoplasm and the subcellular organelles. ArgS1 monitored Arg levels in MDA-MB-231 cells, a breast cancer cell line deficient in a key enzyme for Arg synthesis (arginino-succinate synthetase1, ASS1) and amenable to Arg depletion therapy. We found that Arg levels in MDA-MB-231 cells decreased after depletion of extracellular Arg with a concomitant decline in cell viability. When ASS1 was overexpressed in the cells, Arg levels increased and cell viability was also enhanced. Thus, ArgS1 is an effective tool for real-time monitoring of Arg in human cells over a dynamic range of physiological and pathological relevance.",

We report a woman in her 20s who demonstrated severe polyuria (11-12 L/day) on submitting a 24-hour urine sample for analysis. She subsequently mentioned having had polyuria and polydipsia for 10 years after an Epstein-Barr virus infection. A water deprivation test with copeptin measurement confirmed arginine vasopressin deficiency. Treatment with desmopressin transformed her life. Further investigation revealed possible concurrent subclinical mixed connective tissue disease. We suspect Epstein-Barr virus infection to be the cause of the arginine vasopressin deficiency and possibly the trigger for the subclinical mixed connective tissue disease.

The importance of PRMTs in the incidence and progression of a wide range of diseases, particularly cancers, such as breast, liver, lung, colorectal cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia is increasingly recognized. This underscores the critical need for the development of effective PRMT inhibitors as therapeutic intervention. The field of PRMT inhibitors is in the rapidly growing phase and it is necessary to conduct a summative review of how the so-far developed inhibitors impact PRMT functions and cellular physiology. Our review aims to summarize molecular action mechanisms of these PRMT inhibitors and particularly elaborate their triggered biomedical effects. We describe the cellular phenotype consequences of select PRMT inhibitors across various disease models, thereby providing an understanding of the pharmacological mechanisms underpinning PRMT inhibition. The promising effects of PRMT5 inhibitors in targeted therapy of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase-deleted cancers are particularly highlighted. At last, we provide a perspective on the challenges and further opportunities of developing and applying novel PRMT inhibitors for clinical advancement.",

Thirty-two broiler breeder roosters of the Arian breed were kept at 50 wk of age after a 12-wk acclimatization period. The birds were divided into four treatments and eight replicates in a completely randomized design. Treatments included (1) control (CON), 2) diet supplemented with 150 mg LC per kg diet, (3) diet supplemented with 500 mg L-Arg per kg diet, and (4) diet supplemented with 75 mg LC + 250 mg L-Arg. The use of LC in the roosters' diet increased the concentration, percentages of total mobility, progressive motility, curvilinear velocity and straight line velocity compared to the CON and L-Arg treatment (P < 0.05). The percentage of apoptosis was lower in the LC, L-Arg + LC and L-Arg groups than in the CON group (P < 0.05). In general, LC and the mixture of LC and L-Arg probably improve the sperm quality of aged cockerels through the supply of adenosine triphosphate, antioxidant effects, and the synthesis of nitric oxide.",

Herein, dual ratiometric fluorescence sensors were prepared with the blue emission of levorotatory/dextrorotatory carbon dots (CDs) and the red emission of porphyrin (L/D-CDs-PP) for the sensitive and portable detection of Arg. Interestingly, L-CDs-PP and D-CDs-PP displayed not only the dual emission peaks at 493 and 650 nm but also different response modes to Arg; thus, they could serve as dual ratiometric fluorescence sensors to achieve the accurate and reliable detection of Arg, with the detection limit of 23.87 μM for L-CDs-PP and 2.39 μM for D-CDs-PP. Importantly, the solid-state sensors successfully achieved dual-mode visual and portable detection of Arg with the support of a smartphone platform. In addition, L-CDs-PP and D-CDs-PP exhibited excellent biocompatibility and cell imaging capabilities, and they could achieve the detection of Arg in cells and biological samples of urine and rat plasma. Therefore, the dual ratiometric fluorescence sensors exhibited broad application prospects in the fields of analytical sensing, biological imaging, and medical diagnosis.",

However, whether L-arginine can prevent or only treat pre-eclampsia, and thus the target population and timing of initiation, remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of L-arginine and L-citrulline (precursor of L-arginine) on the prevention and treatment of pre-eclampsia. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Global Index Medicus and the Cochrane Library were searched through 7 February 2024. SELECTION CRITERIA: Trials administering L-arginine or L-citrulline to pregnant women, with the comparison group receiving placebo or standard care, were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Meta-analyses were conducted separately for prevention or treatment trials, using random-effects models. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (2028 women) and three non-randomised trials (189 women) were included. The risk of bias was 'high' in eight RCTs and showed 'some concerns' in 12. In prevention trials, L-arginine was associated with a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia (relative risk [RR] 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35, 0.78; low-certainty evidence, four trials) and severe pre-eclampsia (RR 0.23; 95% CI, 0.09, 0.55; low-certainty evidence, three trials). In treatment trials, L-arginine may reduce mean systolic blood pressure (MD -5.64 mmHg; 95% CI, -10.66, -0.62; very low-certainty evidence, three trials) and fetal growth restriction (RR 0.46; 95% CI, 0.26, 0.81; low-certainty evidence, two trials). Only one study (36 women) examined L-citrulline and reported no effect on pre-eclampsia or blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: L-arginine may be promising for pre-eclampsia prevention and treatment, but findings should be interpreted cautiously. More trials are needed to determine the optimal dose and time to commence supplementation and support clinical decision-making.",

This study introduces a method for creating Tiotropium-bromide liposomal inhalation dry powder, termed \"Trojan-particles,\" utilizing thin-film hydration and spray-drying with lactose-arginine carriers. Encapsulating tiotropium-bromide in nanoliposomes enhances lung treatment via liposomes' unique features. This formulation was examined through in vitro-3D-printing and in silico-CFD analysis. Nanoliposomes and powder were evaluated for physicochemical attributes, aerosolization, encapsulation-efficiency (EE%), and release. Both liposomes (90 nm) and powder particles (3 µm) were spherical. Liposomes had an EE% over 95 % and a zeta-potential of -28.3 mV. The optimal formulation was tested in vitro at 30, 60, and 90 L/min using a 3D-printed airway replica. CFD analysis evaluated particle deposition in steady and realistic inhalation with monodisperse and polydisperse particles. Based on realistic airway geometry, model utilized k-ω-SST turbulence model for the continuous phase and Lagrangian-DEM for the discrete phase, analyzed through ANSYS Fluent. The 20 %-arginine nanoliposomal-tiotropium formulation outperformed others due to arginine's dispersibility and therapeutic benefits, including nitric oxide conversion. The formulation competes with commercial dry powders due to its chemical, biochemical advantages, and Trojan-based physical traits, reducing exhalation risk. Simulation data aligned with experimental findings, showing that higher inhalation flows increase particle deposition in airways due to greater inertia and turbulence. At 60 L/min, the polydisperse model matched experimental data better than the monodisperse model. Alongside improving dry powder performance via a nanoliposomal formulation, this research highlights the development of a novel CFD method for their assessment.",

      "abstract": "Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) plays a vital role in fibrosis of various organs. However, the underlying mechanism of BRD4 in renal fibrosis remains unclear. To construct in vitro and in vivo models of renal fibrosis, TCMK-1 cells were subjected to TGF-β1 treatment and mice were subjected to UUO surgery and adenine induction. IP assay was used for arginine asymmetric dimethylation (ADMA) level, ubiquitination degradation of Snail, and acetylation level of Snail test. Co-IP was used to validate the interactions of BRD4, protein arginine methyltransferase-1 (PRMT1), and Snail. HE staining and Masson staining were used for morphological examination of renal tissue. BRD4 was abnormally overexpressed during renal fibrosis. TGF-β1-induced fibrosis and partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (pEMT) could be inhibited by BRD4 silencing. PRMT1 mediated ADMA level of BRD4 to enhance BRD4 phosphorylation and its protein stability. Snail protein degradation was attenuated by BRD4 overexpression in an acetylation-dependent manner in TCMK-1 cells. Furthermore, PRMT1 inhibitor abolished BRD4 overexpression-induced fibrosis and pEMT in TGF-β1-treated TCMK-1 cells and Snail overexpression reversed BRD4 silencing-induced inhibition of fibrosis and pEMT. What's more, the reduction of BRD4 arginine methylation inhibited BRD4 phosphorylation and Snail expression to alleviate renal fibrosis in UUO surgery and adenine induction mice. Collectively, PRMT1-mediated BRD4 arginine methylation and phosphorylation promoted pEMT and renal fibrosis through regulation of Snail expression.",

However, effective nutritional interventions have not been adequately established. Research in ALS model mice has shown that L-arginine can prolong survival; however, no human intervention studies have been conducted. We conducted a single-center, single-arm, prospective, open-label, and comparative trial to assess the safety and tolerability of L-arginine hydrochloride in ALS patients. ALS patients were administered 15 g/day L-arginine hydrochloride for 90 days. The primary outcome of safety was evaluated on days 45 and 90. The secondary outcome of efficacy was evaluated by measuring nutritional status, ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) scores, and the occurrence of events such as the initiation of tracheostomy positive pressure ventilation (TPPV) and death. The study included 20 patients (40% female; mean age, 62.0 ± 6.9 years; median disease duration, 1.9 years). Six participants (30%) experienced treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), including elevated creatine kinase levels, liver function test abnormalities, glucose tolerance issues, hyperammonemia, anorexia, dysgeusia, and vasculitis. No serious TEAEs were associated with L-arginine hydrochloride. Over the course of three months, the average changes in body weight, body mass index, and the ALSFRS score were - 0.37 kg, -1.1 kg/m2, and - 1.7 points, respectively. There were no events requiring TPPV initiation or deaths. This study demonstrated that the oral administration of L-arginine hydrochloride over three months was well tolerated by ALS patients, with no serious TEAEs or deaths attributed to the study drug.Trial Registration number: Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCTs061230001), first registered 11/04/2023.",

To characterize the anti-pigmenting effects of a newly designed derivative ascorbyl glucoside-arginine complex (AGAC) on SLs, lotions with or without 28% AGAC were applied twice daily for 24 weeks in a double-blind half-face study of 27 Japanese females with SLs. The pigmentation scores and skin colors of previously selected SLs on the right and left sides of the faces of the subjects were evaluated using a photo-scale, a color difference meter and a Mexameter. Treatment with the test lotion elicited a significant decrease in pigmentation scores at 24 weeks compared to week 0, with a significant decrease in pigmentation scores at 24 weeks compared to the placebo lotion. In the test lotion-treated SLs, the lightness (L) and melanin index (MI) values that reflect the pigmentation level significantly increased and decreased, respectively, at 12 and 24 weeks of treatment compared to week 0. Comparisons of increased L values or decreased MI values between the test and placebo lotion-treated SLs demonstrated that the test lotion-treated SLs had significantly higher increased L or decreased MI values than the placebo lotion-treated SLs both at 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. The sum of our results strongly indicates that AGAC is distinctly effective in ameliorating the hyperpigmentation levels of SLs at a level visibly recognizable by the subjects, without any hypo-pigmenting effects or skin problems.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: In older patients undergoing cardiac surgery, physical function is a critical determinant of postoperative outcomes. Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation has been shown to promote muscle protein anabolism and inhibit catabolism, thereby preventing muscle weakness. However, its efficacy in older patients undergoing cardiac surgery remains unknown. This study aimed to examine the effects of preoperative HMB supplementation on postoperative physical function and complications in this population. METHODS: In this single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial, patients aged ≥65 years scheduled for cardiac surgery were randomized to receive HMB supplementation or no nutritional intervention. The HMB group received HMB 1200 mg, l-glutamine 7000 mg, and l-arginine 7000 mg, once or twice daily, for at least 2 weeks before surgery. Evaluations were performed at baseline and before and after surgery. The primary outcome was the 6-min walking distance (6MWD) before and after surgery. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of complications, muscle mass and strength, physical performance, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Forty-four patients with a mean age of 72.5 years (women, 38 %) were randomized to the HMB (n = 22) or control (n = 22) group. Compared with the control group, the HMB group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the 6MWD both at the pre-surgery (448.0 ± 73.5 m vs. 375.5 ± 58.8 m; P = 0.01) and post-surgery time points (428.9 ± 76.4 m vs. 304.5 ± 52.3 m; P = 0.001). Muscle strength and physical performance also showed significant improvements in the HMB group. However, no significant difference in muscle mass was observed between the groups at any time point. The HMB group had a shorter hospital length of stay compared with that of the control group (16.1 ± 3.8 days vs. 20.4 ± 7.6 days, P = 0.03), and no adverse events were observed with the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative HMB supplementation in older adults undergoing cardiac surgery resulted in significant improvements in postoperative exercise capacity and physical function, along with a reduction in the length of hospital stay, without affecting muscle mass.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Therapeutic advancements for the polyglutamine diseases, particularly spinocerebellar degeneration, are eagerly awaited. We evaluated the safety, tolerability, and therapeutic effects of L-arginine, which inhibits the conformational change and aggregation of polyglutamine proteins, in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6). METHODS: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial (clinical trial ID: AJA030-002, registration number: jRCT2031200135) was performed on 40 genetically confirmed SCA6 patients enrolled between September 1, 2020, and September 30, 2021. The main inclusion criteria were as follows: SCA6 diagnosed by genetic testing, 20 years of age or older, Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) \"walking\" score of at least one point, and SARA \"total\" score of at least 10 points, and ability to walk 10 m or more with or without an assistive device. The investigational drug was administered orally at 0.50 g/kg/day (L-arginine group: L-arginine 0.38 g/kg/day; placebo group: L-arginine 0.0 g/kg/day) for 48 weeks. Subjects who consented to participate were assigned a subject identification code, and were allocated 1:1 to the L-arginine or the placebo group, according to a predetermined allocation chart. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in total Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) score from baseline to 48 weeks. The secondary endpoints were 1) SARA walking + standing score, 2) each of the eight SARA scales at 0, 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48 weeks, and 3) TUGT, BDI-II, CGI, PGI-I, and SF-8. FINDINGS: Forty patients received the investigational drug, and 37 completed the study (L-arginine group: 18; placebo group: 19). The mean medication adherence rate was 97.2% in the l-arginine group. Regarding the primary endpoint, the difference between the L-arginine group and the placebo group was -1.52 (95% CI: -3.10 to 0.06, P = 0.0582). As the secondary endpoints, the change of SARA total score from baseline was greater in the L-arginine group than in the placebo group at all assessment time points, but the differences were not significant. Two serious (required hospitalization) adverse reactions occurred in the L-arginine group, including one case of pneumonia (severe, death) and one case of abnormal liver function (moderate, recovery). INTERPRETATION: L-arginine treatment resulted in an improvement tendency in SARA total score of SCA6 patients. Our results suggest that a phase 3 study of L-arginine for SCA6, with a 48-week observation period and change in total SARA score as the primary endpoint, may be feasible for further analyzing the therapeutic effect of L-arginine. However, careful consideration of statistical power and sample size is necessary. FUNDING: Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development and Health Labour Sciences Research Grant, Japan."

      "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) involves persistent inflammation in the colon and rectum, with excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. This ROS buildup damages colonic epithelial cells and disrupts intestinal flora, worsening disease progression. Current antioxidant therapies are limited due to their instability in the gut and lack of targeting, hindering precise intervention at the lesion site. This study prepares an L-Arginine-modified selenium nanozyme (Se-CA) for the targeted oral treatment of UC. Se-CA specifically targets M1-type macrophages at sites of inflammation by binding to cationic amino acid transporter protein 2 on the surface of M1-type macrophages. In vitro studies show that Se-CA scavenges reactive ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in artificial gastric acid and intestinal fluids, and inhibits iron death in intestinal epithelial cells. In mice model of ulcerative colitis, oral administration of Se-CA is effective in the treatment of colitis through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, inhibition of iron death and regulation of intestinal flora. In conclusion, this work provides new insights into the targeted oral treatment of UC.",

      "abstract": "Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are enriched in certain miRNAs, impacting the progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The mechanisms involved in the selective sEV miRNA enrichment remain to be elucidated. We recently reported that Serine/Arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1) regulates selective sEV miRNA enrichment in PDAC cells. SRSF1 is an onco-protein that is overexpressed in PDAC, and its function is dictated by posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation and arginine methylation. The objective of this study was to examine the role of phosphorylation and arginine methylation in SRSF1-mediated sEV miRNA enrichment in PDAC cells. Treatment of PDAC cells with the protein arginine methyltransferase inhibitors AMI-5 and EPZ015666, but not with the phosphorylation inhibitor SRPIN340, selectively enhanced the level of sEV miR-1246, a miRNA known to be highly enriched in PDAC sEVs. Consistently, overexpression of the mutant SRSF1 with the three arginine residues R93, R97, and R109 being replaced with lysinaugmented sEV miR-1246 levels in both wild-type and SRSF1-knockdown PANC-1 cells. Interestingly, the binding of SRSF1 to miR-1246 was significantly reduced in PDAC cells overexpressing the mutant SRSF1, which was further confirmed using purified wild-type and the mutant SRSF1 proteins. We demonstrate that arginine demethylation of SRSF1 reduces SRSF1-miRNA binding in PDAC cells and enhances selective sEV miRNA enrichment, providing novel insight into SRSF1-mediated sEV miRNA enrichment in PDAC cells and opening up new avenues of investigation on the biology and function of extracellular vesicles in PDAC.",

Approximately 50% of mesotheliomas do not express argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1), the rate-limiting enzyme in arginine biosynthesis, making arginine depletion with pegylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20) an attractive therapeutic strategy. We investigated whether combinatory treatment composed of ADI-PEG20 and polyamine inhibitors constitutes a promising novel therapeutic strategy to overcome ADI-PEG20 resistance in mesothelioma patients. Treatment of ADI-PEG20-resistant cell lines with a range of different polyamine inhibitors demonstrated that ADI-PEG20-resistant cell lines were highly sensitive to the spermidine-analog GC7. We observed a synergistic effect of GC7 and ADI-PEG20 in both ADI-PEG20-sensitive and ADI-PEG20-resistant cell lines. Metabolomic analysis revealed that sensitivity to GC7 is due to inhibition of the Tricarboxylic (TCA) cycle. Significantly, combination of GC7 and ADI-PEG20 prevented the emergence of resistant cells in vitro. Taken together, we have identified the therapeutic potential of combinatorial treatment of ADI-PEG20 with GC7 for mesothelioma management."

      "abstract": "Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) arises from dysregulated wound healing, leading to excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and impaired lung function. Macrophages exhibit high plasticity, polarizing to pro-inflammatory M1 during early inflammation and anti-inflammatory, fibrosis-inducing M2 during later stages of PF. Additionally, neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) release mediated by peptidyl arginine deiminase (PAD-4), also play a key role in PF progression. PAD-4 inhibitor chloro-amidine (CLA) has shown anti-fibrotic effects in bleomycin (BLM) induced PF mouse model in our earlier study. Here, we have demonstrated that CLA also exhibited inhibition of macrophage polarisation in in-vitro in THP-1 monocytes and in-vivo in BLM induced PF. THP-1 monocytes were exposed to NETs isolated from phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) stimulated and PMA plus CLA treated differentiated HL-60 (dHL-60) cells. Monocytes exposed to stimulated NETs resulted in increased oxidative stress, disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential and increased M1 and M2 macrophage markers. These alterations were abrogated in THP-1 cells upon exposure to CLA treated NETs. Further, CLA treatment in BLM induced mice improved abnormal BALF, biochemical, and histological parameters in line with our previous findings. Additionally, CLA also reduced M1 and M2 markers time-dependently, as shown by immunofluorescence (IF), western blot, and RT-PCR analysis. CLA treatment led to decreased expression of PAD-4, M1-related pro-inflammatory cytokines and M2-related pro-fibrotic cytokines and mediators, as confirmed by western blot and ELISA analysis. Thus, it is established that inhibition of PAD-4 lead to mitigation of macrophage polarisation and a combined anti-fibrotic effect is achieved which can be explored further.",

      "abstract": "Salinity stress disrupts water uptake and nutrient absorption, causing reduced photosynthesis, stunted growth, and decreased crop yields in plants. The use of indole acetic acid (IAA), arginine (AN), and mango fruit waste biochar (MFWB) can be effective methods to overcome this problem. Indole acetic acid (IAA) is a natural auxin hormone that aids cell elongation and division, thereby increasing plant height and branching. L-arginine, an amino acid, is crucial for plant defense mechanisms, forming proline, polyamines, and nitric oxide, which regulate biological activities and prevent oxidative damage. Mango fruit waste biochar enhances soil fertility and water retention, thereby enhancing fruit development and yield. This study investigates the effects of combining IAA and AN as amendments to fenugreek, with and without MFWB. Four treatments (control, 2mM IAA, 250 mg/L AN, and 250 mg/L AN + 2mM IAA) study were conducted in four replications using a completely randomized design. Results demonstrate that the 250 mg/L AN + 2mM IAA with MFWB treatment led to a significant rise in fenugreek plant length (30.26%), plant fresh weight (36.37%), and plant dry weight (15.78%) over the control under salinity stress. There was a notable increase in chlorophyll a (5.13%), chlorophyll b (14.06%), total chlorophyll (7.79%), and shoot N, P, K from the control under salinity stress also showing the potential of 250 mg/L AN + 2mM IAA with MFWB. In conclusion, applying 250 mg/L AN + 2mM IAA with MFWB is a strategy for alleviating salinity stress in fenugreeks.",

Methionine participates in cellular processes by converting to methyl donor for the methylation of DNA, RNA and protein. However, it remains unclear whether methionine affects drug resistance by influencing YAP activity. In this study, we report that methionine deprivation remarkably suppresses the transcriptional activity of YAP-TEAD in cancer cells. Methionine promotes PRMT1-catalyzed asymmetric dimethylation at R124 of YAP (YAP R124me2a). Mimicking of YAP methylation abolishes the reduction effect of methionine-restricted diet on YAP-induced drug resistance. YAP activates the transcription of SLC43A2, the methionine transporter, to increase methionine uptake in cancer cells. Knockdown of SLC43A2 decreases the level of YAP R124me2a. BCH, the inhibitor of SLC43A2, sensitizes tumors to anticancer drugs. Thus, our results unravel the positive feedback between YAP R124 methylation and SLC43A2 that contributes to anticancer drug resistance. Disrupting this positive feedback could be a potential strategy for cancer therapy.",

METHODS: M - 1 cells were stimulated with desmopressin (dDAVP) and Ang II, followed by treatment with tolvaptan and losartan. The expression and protein levels of V2R, AT1R, AQP2, and p-S256AQP2 were measured via ELISA, western blotting, RT-qPCR, and immunofluorescence. Molecular docking was employed to assess the interaction affinities between Ang II, losartan, and V2R, as well as dDAVP, tolvaptan, and AT1R. RESULTS: dDAVP stimulation significantly upregulated the expression of V2R, AQP2, and p-S256AQP2 in M - 1 cells. Ang II stimulation also resulted in significant increases in AT1R, AQP2, p-S256AQP2 expression. Interestingly, we found that dDAVP could stimulate the expression of AT1R, and Ang II could stimulate the expression of V2R. Following tolvaptan treatment, the expression levels of V2R, AQP2, p-S256AQP2, and AT1R were significantly reduced. Similarly, losartan treatment led to a marked decrease in AT1R, AQP2, p-S256AQP2, and V2R expression. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the binding interactions between Ang II and losartan with V2R, as well as between dDAVP and tolvaptan with AT1R. CONCLUSION: AVP and Ang II collaboratively regulate the expression of V2R and AT1R in M - 1 cells, influencing AQP2 expression.",

Subsequently, we summarized the PRMT inhibitors in clinical trials and the co-crystal structural of PRMT7 inhibitors. Moreover, we also focus on recent progress in the design and development of modulators targeting PRMT7, including isoform-selective and non-selective PRMT7 inhibitors, and the dual-target inhibitors based on PRMT7, from the perspectives of rational design, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and the clinical status of these modulators.

By utilizing a scaffold hopping strategy, a novel series of 3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-1(2H)-one derivatives were designed and synthesized. Through a systematic SAR study, D3 demonstrated excellent PRMT5 inhibitory activity, potent antiproliferative activity against Z-138, favorable pharmacokinetic profiles, and low hERG toxicity. Molecular docking, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) study indicated that D3 was tightly interacted with PRMT5. Meanwhile, D3 exhibited high selectivity against PRMT5, which could inhibit the growth of various cancer cells, induce apoptosis, and arrest the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase. Additionally, D3 possessed excellent antitumor efficacy in Z-138 xenograft models, low toxicity in vivo, and acceptable drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK) profiles in vitro. Therefore, D3 can be developed as a promising candidate for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).",

      "abstract": "In patients with type II diabetes, the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DC) is associated with a high risk of mortality. Left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, and exercise intolerance are the first signs of DC. The underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated, and there is an urgent need for specific biomarkers and molecular targets for early diagnosis and treatment. Mitochondrial alterations play a key role in the development of DC, and microRNAs regulating mitochondrial function are emerging as potential biomarkers of metabolic stress in DC. L-Arginine (Arg) supplementation has been shown to be an effective strategy for improving mitochondrial function and energetics, with a significant impact on physical performance. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects of Arg supplementation on cardiac mitochondrial function, DC development, and relative phenotypes including exercise intolerance. We used db/db mice as a model of type II diabetes, chronically treated with Arg (1 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks. Arg-treated db/db mice showed preserved diastolic function and left ventricular morphology compared with untreated diabetic mice. Arg supplementation also improved exercise tolerance and the propensity to physical activity. Mitochondrial respiration was significantly increased in cardiomyocytes isolated from treated db/db mice, as well as in diabetic cardiomyocytes treated with Arg in vitro. The improvement of cardiac mitochondrial function in db/db + Arg mice was associated with an increase in PGC-1-alpha levels, mitochondrial biogenesis, recycling, and antioxidant capacity. Arg treatment prevented the accumulation of circulating and cardiac miR-143 in db/db mice, which is an index of metabolic stress and activation of mitochondrial damage mechanisms. In conclusion, Arg supplementation is effective in preventing the development of DC, preserving diastolic function and exercise tolerance by improving mitochondrial fitness and homeostasis. Additionally, miR-143 could potentially be employed to monitor cardiac metabolic stress and the effects of Arg treatment in diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Cancer treatments have continued to improve tremendously over the past decade, but therapy resistance is still a common, major factor encountered by patients diagnosed with cancer. Chemoresistance arises due to various circumstances and among these causes, increasing evidence has shown that enzymes referred to as protein methyltransferases (PMTs) play a significant role in the development of chemoresistance in various cancers. These enzymes are responsible for the methylation of different amino acids, particularly lysine and arginine, via protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs) and protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs), respectively. Various PMTs have been identified to be dysregulated in the development of cancer and chemoresistance. Nonetheless, the functional role of these PMTs in the development of chemoresistance is poorly characterised. This advocates the need for innovative approaches and technologies suitable for better characterisation of these PMTs and their potential clinical inhibitors. In the case of a handful of PMTs, inhibitory small molecules which can function as anticancer drugs have been developed and have also entered clinical trials. Considering all this, PMTs have become a promising and valuable target in cancer chemoresistance related research. This review will give a small introduction on the different PKMTs and PRMTs families which are dysregulated in different cancers and the known proteins targeted by the respective enzymes. The focus will then shift towards PMTs known to be involved in chemoresistance development and the inhibitors developed against these, together with their mode of action. Lastly, the current obstacles and future perspectives of PMT inhibitors in cancer chemoresistance will be discussed."

The aim of this study was to analyze the frequency of AVP-D in organ donors, its treatment, as well as the impact of AVP-D on hemodynamics and renal function. Methods: This single-center, retrospective study included 63 organ donors treated between 2017 and 2022. We used standard criteria to examine the incidence of AVP-D and the KDIGO criteria to determine the rate of acute kidney injury (AKI). Results: AVP-D occurred in 79% of the examined organ donors, of which 94% received desmopressin. Overall, 30% of organ donors developed AKI. AKI was present in 77% of donors who did not meet AVP-D criteria and in only 18% of donors with AVP-D (p < 0.001). Mean arterial blood pressure did not differ between organ donors with and without AVP-D or with and without desmopressin therapy. In organ donors with AVP-D, norepinephrine requirement in the period 24 h prior to AVP-D diagnosis was lower than 24 h afterwards (p = 0.03). AVP-D diagnosis was associated with a higher rate of kidney transplantation compared to cases without AVP-D diagnosis (88% vs. 54%, p = 0.01). Conclusions: AVP-D is common among brain death organ donors and may remain undiagnosed in cases with previous kidney injury. These observations highlight the importance of recognizing AVP-D and administering appropriate therapy in potential organ donors to prevent AKI."

However, the increased tumor hypoxia and acidification will lead to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) featuring exhausted T cells, limiting the effectiveness of subsequent therapies following TACE. Herein, a stable water-in-oil lipiodol Pickering emulsion by employing calcium phosphate nanoparticles (CaP NPs) as stabilizers is developed and used to encapsulate L-arginine (L-Arg), which is known for its ability to modulate T-cell metabolism. The obtained L-Arg-loaded CaP-stabilized lipiodol Pickering emulsion (L-Arg@CaPL) with great emulsion stability can not only neutralize the tumor acidity via reaction of CaP NPs with protons but also enable the release of L-Arg, thereby synergistically promoting the reinvigoration of exhausted CD8+ T cells and effectively reversing tumor immunosuppression. As a result, TACE therapy with L-Arg@CaPL shows greatly improved therapeutic responses as demonstrated in an orthotopic liver tumor model in rats. This study highlights an effective yet simple nanoparticle-stabilized Pickering emulsion strategy to promote TACE therapy via modulation of the immunosuppressive TME, presenting great potential for clinical translation.",

      "abstract": "Peri-implantitis, caused by bacterial biofilm on dental implants, leads to bone loss and tissue inflammation, ultimately causing oral health decline. Traditional methods to remove biofilm are ineffective in promoting reosseointegration on implant surfaces. This phenomenon can be attributed to two factors: incomplete removal of biofilm from hard-to-reach areas and alterations in the physicochemical properties of implant surfaces caused by decontamination procedures. To address this problem, we developed D-arginine-loaded chitooligosaccharide-capped pH-responsive mesoporous silica nanoparticles (Dar@MSN-COS) for improving the efficacy of decontamination of Water Jet (WJ). Dar@MSN-COS particles exhibit a targeted approach towards the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) in order to disrupt the biofilm, and possess the capability to infiltrate confined areas between implant screws. Following this, the WJ treatment effectively removed residual biofilm and demonstrated improved cleaning efficacy. Furthermore, the decontamination of the Dar@MSN-COS combination with WJ promotes effective cell cytocompatibility on the titanium surface. The results of mechanistic experiments indicate that Dar@MSN-COS may act on biofilms by releasing a significant quantity of reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting it as a key contributing factor. In summary, our novel therapeutic protocol shows promise as an alternative solution for addressing the clinically complex aspects of peri-implantitis.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hand-foot-skin reaction (HFSR) is the most common side effect of multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). Sarcopenia has been reported to be a poor prognostic factor for HCC. Here, we performed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the efficacy of a β-hydroxy-β-methyl butyrate/l-arginine/l-glutamine (HMB/Arg/Gln) beverage and locomotion training as supportive care in the treatment of uHCC with lenvatinib. METHODS: A total of 20 patients were enrolled from the jRCTs031190252 trial in this pilot study. HFSR was the primary endpoint, and other adverse events and skeletal muscle index at the third lumbar level (L3-SMI) were secondary endpoints. RESULTS: Twelve patients had albumin-bilirubin grade 1, and eight had grade 2. No difference in HFSR was observed. Although interesting differences were observed in the secondary endpoints, a slight retention of L3-SMI values in the intervention group compared with that in the control group was observed (96.5 % vs. 89.9 %, p = 0.407). CONCLUSION: Although the HMB/Arg/Gln beverage and locomotion training did not reduce adverse events caused by lenvatinib, they might be useful in maintaining skeletal muscle mass. Further validation studies with a larger number of patients are warranted.",

      "abstract": "Arginine vasopressin (AVP) has disparate impacts on immune responses by divergent receptors on cells including DCs. This study was conducted with the aim of investigating the impact of AVP on the maturation and expression of the inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules in tolerogenic monocyte-derived DCs. CD14 marker was used to separate monocytes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by MACS method. To differentiate monocytes from DCs, we utilized GM-CSF and IL-4 cytokines. Tolerogenic DCs were generated using vitamin D3 and dexamethasone. We added LPS and AVP to the culture medium on day 6 after incubation of DCs at 37 °C. Finally, we assessed the surface molecules by flow cytometry and used real-time PCR to evaluate the expression of genes related to the inhibitory immune checkpoints. Based on the obtained data, AVP increased the expression of CD11c (P ≤ 0.0001), HLA-DR (P ≤ 0.01), and CD86 (P ≤ 0.01) in AVP-mDCs. Also, the expression of all the immune checkpoint genes including CTLA-4 (P ≤ 0.001), BTLA (P ≤ 0.001), PDL-1 (P ≤ 0.05), B7H7 (P ≤ 0.001), LAG3 (P ≤ 0.01), and VISTA (P ≤ 0.001) in AVP-mDCs was increased in comparison to the control group. Vasopressin caused the generation of mature and tolerogenic DCs. Our data may help to consider AVP-mDCs to take part in autoimmune disease therapy, transplanted tissue rejection impedance, and allergies.",

We aimed to investigate the relationship between resistance to aminoglycosides and the MexXY-OprM expression level in P. aeruginosa clinical isolates without and after treatment with curcumin and/or phenylalanine-arginine-beta-naphthylamide (PAβN) as the efflux pump inhibitors. METHODS: We collected 100 clinical isolates from hospitalized patients. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of aminoglycosides were determined by the micro-broth dilution method in the presence and absence of PAβN and/or curcumin. Then, real-time PCR was used to determine the expression level of the MexXY-OprM efflux pump. RESULTS: In this study, 34%, 35%, 10%, 38%, 43%, 42%, and 39% of the clinical isolates were resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, netilmicin, spectinomycin, kanamycin, and streptomycin, respectively. Also, 45% of the isolates showed an overexpression of the mexY gene, while 31 (68.88%) isolates exhibited a 2-3-fold overexpression, and 14 (31.11%) isolates had a more than threefold overexpression of the mexY gene. However, 4 (8.88%) isolates showed a ≥ 10-fold overexpression of this gene. The combination of PAβN with spectinomycin, netilmicin, streptomycin, and kanamycin exhibited a reduced MIC range of these aminoglycosides in 93.02%, 86.8%, 76.9%, and 71.4% of resistant isolates, respectively. Additionally, all gentamicin-, tobramycin-, kanamycin-, streptomycin-, and netilmicin-resistant isolates showed a decreased MIC range in combination with curcumin. The most synergistic effect of curcumin and PAβN was observed in combination with spectinomycin, while the least synergistic effect was detected with kanamycin. CONCLUSION: Curcumin can be a significant efflux inhibitor as an adjuvant in combination with aminoglycosides for successful treatment of patients infected by P. aeruginosa overexpressing the MexXY-OprM efflux pump."

      "abstract": "Acute Lung Injury/Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ALI/ARDS) with clinical manifestations of respiratory distress and hypoxemia remains a significant cause of respiratory failure, boasting a persistently high incidence and mortality rate. Given the central role of M1 macrophages in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI), this study utilized the anti-inflammatory agent curcumin as a model drug. l-arginine (L-Arg) was employed as a targeting ligand, and chitosan was initially modified with l-arginine. Subsequently, it was utilized as a surface modifier to prepare inhalable nano-crystals loaded with curcumin (Arg-CS-Cur), aiming for specific targeting of pulmonary M1 macrophages. Compared with unmodified chitosan-curcumin nanocrystals (CS-Cur), Arg-CS-Cur exhibited higher uptake in vitro by M1 macrophages, as evidenced by flow cytometry showing the highest fluorescence intensity in the Arg-CS-Cur group (P < 0.01). In vivo accumulation was greater in inflamed lung tissues, as indicated by small animal imaging demonstrating higher lung fluorescence intensity in the DiR-Arg-CS-Cur group compared to the DiR-CS-Cur group in the rat ALI model (P < 0.05), peaking at 12 h. Moreover, Arg-CS-Cur demonstrated enhanced therapeutic effects in both LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells and ALI rat models. Specifically, treatment with Arg-CS-Cur significantly suppressed NO release and levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in RAW264.7 cells (p < 0.01), while in ALI rat models, expression levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in lung tissues were significantly lower than those in the model group (P < 0.01). Furthermore, lung tissue damage was significantly reduced, with histological scores significantly lower than those in the CS-Cur group (P < 0.01). In conclusion, these findings underscore the targeting potential of l-arginine-modified nanocrystals, which effectively enhance curcumin concentration in inflammatory environments by selectively targeting M1 macrophages. This study thus introduces novel perspectives and theoretical support for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions for acute inflammatory lung diseases, including ALI/ARDS.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) disrupts oxygen transport due to the abnormal shape and rigidity of red blood cells, leading to hemolysis. Hemolysis, a major co-morbidity in SCD, is indicated by elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Arginine depletion, which is essential for nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, contributes to various complications in SCD. L-arginine supplementation may increase NO levels and reduce oxidative stress. Research on its benefits in SCD, which is prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, is limited. This study evaluates the effect of arginine supplementation on LDH levels in patients with steady state SCD. METHODS: In a retrospective study, we evaluated the effect of arginine supplementation on LDH levels in a cohort of 31 patients. We divided the study into three phases: pre-HU treatment, HU treatment, and combined HU and arginine supplementation. RESULTS: The cohort had a median age of 12 years, ranging from 2 to 43 years. Throughout all three phases of the study, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were consistently above the established normal ranges, with elevations of 216.7%, 220.3% and 176.6% above the normative values for baseline, Phase 1 (HU) and Phase 2 (HU + Arg), respectively. Specifically, LDH levels were 649.7 ± 364.2 U/L in Baseline Phase, 661.6 ± 367 U/L in Phase 1, and 529.9 ± 346.3 U/L in Phase 2. When comparing these discrete study intervals, it is noteworthy that LDH levels were significantly lower in Phase 2 compared to the previous phases (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Preliminary findings revealed a significant lower LDH levels among sickle cell patients receiving combined arginine supplementation and hydroxyurea (HU). Although these findings are promising, their credibility and applicability require further and more extensive research."

      "abstract": "Eosinophils play a featured role among inflammatory cells participating in the onset and development of asthma. Activated eosinophils release several cytotoxic granular proteins, such as major basic protein (MBP), posing a significant threat to airway epithelium. Ferroptosis, a novel form of cell death, is gaining recognition for its involvement in asthma pathogenesis, though the specific mechanisms remain largely unknown. Herein, we revealed that poly-l-arginine (PLA), an MBP mimic, induced ferroptosis in airway epithelium by downregulating γ-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein-like 1 (GABARAPL1). Reduced GABARAPL1 expression was further confirmed in ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma mice and PLA-treated human airway organoids (hAOs). Mechanistically, PLA activated mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, inhibiting pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 1 (PBX1), which in turn leads to transcriptional downregulation of GABARAPL1. Furthermore, MBP extracted from eosinophils, similar to PLA, induced ferroptosis in airway epithelial cells, as well as modulating mTORC1/PBX1/GABARAPL1 pathway. Finally, Ferrostatin-1 treatment or GABARAPL1 overexpression alleviated ferroptosis and airway inflammation in asthmatic mice. Overall, our findings highlight the cell communication between eosinophils and airway epithelial cells. MBP modulates the mTORC1/PBX1/GABARAPL1 axis, thereby serving as a significant contributor to ferroptosis in airway epithelium and airway inflammation. This suggests that suppressing ferroptosis in airway epithelium or targeting eosinophils and MBP could lead to novel therapeutic strategies for asthma management.",

ABSTRACT: MeCP2 is a gene located on the X chromosome and the main pathogenic gene responsible for Rett syndrome, which mainly occurs in females. Herein, we identified a male patient with a novel MeCP2 p.Lys254* variant through whole-exome sequencing, although both parents are wild type. Upon birth, the patient presented with typical symptoms, such as abnormal electroencephalogram, immature sleep rhythm, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, pulmonary fluid accumulation, horizontal fissures in the lungs, hypoventilation, and other symptoms. Period of breathing support, but also found that the boy had a heart defect and horizontal fissure in the lungs. Our discovery of a new spontaneous MeCP2 nonsense mutation enriches the understanding of Rett syndrome and provides a reference for its early diagnosis and treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To explore the therapeutic role of arginine vasopressin (AVP) and its possible mechanisms in autism. METHODS: Mid-trimester pregnant rats treated with valproate on embryonic day 12.5 and their offspring were selected as autism model. The autism rats were randomly assigned to autism group and AVP treatment group that given AVP by inhalation per day from postnatal days 21 to 42. The changes in social behavior and the hippocampus transcriptome were compared, and the hub genes were confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Mendelian randomization (MR). RESULTS: 403 genes were found to be differentially expressed in the autism model, with the majority of these genes being involved in oligodendrocyte development and myelination. Only 11 genes associated with myelination exhibited statistically significant alterations following AVP treatment when compared to the autism group. Gene set enrichment, expression patterns, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) analysis consistently indicated that the biological processes of oligodendrocyte development and myelination were markedly enriched in the autism group and exhibited improvement following treatment. The variation trend of various nerve cells demonstrated a notable increase in the proportion of oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells in the autism group, which subsequently exhibited a significant decline following treatment. Five hub genes (MBP, PLIP, CNP, GFAP, and TAOK1) were verified by qPCR. Finally, MR studies have confirmed a causal relationship between hippocampal myelination-related gene expression and the risk of autism. CONCLUSIONS: AVP could markedly enhance social interaction abilities in the autism rat model, possibly due to the significantly improved hippocampus oligodendrocytes development and myelination.",

Despite their significant potential, integrin-targeted therapies have faced substantial challenges in clinical trials, including variable efficacy and unmet high expectations. Nevertheless, the consistent expression of integrins on tumor and stromal cells underscores their ongoing relevance and potential. Traditional RGD-based imaging and therapeutic agents have faced limitations, such as inconsistent target expression and rapid systemic clearance, which have reduced their effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, recent research has focused on advancing RGD-based strategies and exploring innovative solutions. This review offers a thorough analysis of the latest developments in the RGD-integrin field, with a particular focus on addressing previous limitations. It delves into new dual-targeting approaches and cutting-edge RGD-based agents designed to improve both tumor diagnosis and therapeutic outcomes. By examining these advancements, this review illuminates new pathways for enhancing the specificity and efficacy of integrin-targeted therapies, paving the way for more effective cancer diagnosis and treatment strategies."

It bears the risk of hyponatraemia with potential severe long-term sequelae, but data on hyponatraemia as a side effect of continuous vasopressin infusion for paediatric intensive care patients is scarce. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis performed at a tertiary care paediatric intensive care unit with 2000 annual admissions, patients were included if they were treated with intravenous vasopressin between 2016 and 2022. Baseline sodium concentrations, lowest sodium concentrations during arginine vasopressin treatment, and time to lowest sodium concentration (nadir) were derived. RESULTS: In total, 170 patients with a median age of 4 months [interquartile range, IQR, 0-33] were included, 92.4% underwent surgery, and 28.8% died. Median arginine vasopressin dose rate was 0.027 IU/kg/h [0.019-0.036] and arginine vasopressin was started 3.2 [0-26] h after intensive care admission. Median arginine vasopressin application duration was 13.6 h [6.2-32.6]. Baseline sodium was 141 mmol/L [138-145], and lowest median sodium during arginine vasopressin infusion was 137 mmol/L [132-141] (nadir at 8.4 h [1.0-28.1] after arginine vasopressin start). Hyponatraemia (<135 mmol/L) occurred in 38.2% of patients during AVP treatment, and physicians administered a median of 10.2 mmol/kg/d [6.2-16.4] sodium during arginine vasopressin therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Under arginine vasopressin infusion, hyponatraemia was common, although high daily doses of sodium were administered to keep the serum values in physiologic ranges. This emphasises the need for close electrolyte monitoring and sodium substitution in children and adolescents under arginine vasopressin treatment to avoid hyponatraemia and related sequelae."

      "abstract": "Metal-containing dyes in the textile industry release heavy metal ions into wastewater, posing significant environmental risks and complicating treatment processes. Among various removal methods, chemical adsorption through functional groups that form stable complexes is one of the most effective. Tannic acid (TA), renowned for its strong chelation of metal ions via phenolic hydroxyl groups, faces challenges in operation and recycling in its powdered form. Electrospun polyamide 6 (PA6) nanofiber membranes, characterized by high surface area and structural stability, offer a promising platform. However, achieving an optimal TA loading remains a technical hurdle for industrial applications. To address this, we developed an arginine (l-Arg) bridging strategy to enhance the TA loading on PA6 nanofibers. Additionally, we implemented an NH3 escape foaming technique to increase membrane porosity by 20% and quadruple pore size, enhancing surface roughness and resulting in a 70% increase in TA loading. The optimized adsorbent demonstrated the effective removal of various heavy metal ions, achieving over 95% removal efficiency for five different metals. Even after five adsorption-desorption cycles, the membrane retained over 92% efficiency, translating to a treatment capacity of 12.5 tons of wastewater per kilogram of foaming fiber, underscoring its potential for practical wastewater treatment applications."

      "abstract": "Black spot, one of the major diseases of kiwifruit, is caused by Alternaria alternata. A comprehensive investigation into its pathogenicity mechanism is imperative in order to propose a targeted and effective control strategy. The effect of L-arginine on the pathogenicity of A. alternata and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. The results showed that treatment with 5 mM L-1 of L-arginine promoted spore germination and increased the colony diameter and lesion diameter of A. alternata in vivo and in vitro, which were 23.1% and 9.3% higher than that of the control, respectively. Exogenous L-arginine treatment also induced endogenous L-arginine and nitric oxide (NO) accumulation by activating nitric oxide synthase (NOS), arginine decarboxylase (ADC) and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). In addition, exogenous L-arginine triggered an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels by activating the activity and inducing gene expression upregulation of NADPH oxidase. The hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide anion (O2.-) levels were 15.9% and 2.2 times higher, respectively, than in the control group on the second day of L-arginine treatment. Meanwhile, antioxidant enzyme activities and gene expression levels were enhanced, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and glutathione reductase (GR). In addition, exogenous L-arginine stimulated cell wall-degrading enzymes in vivo and in vitro by activating gene expression. These results suggested that exogenous L-arginine promoted the pathogenicity of A. alternata by inducing the accumulation of polyamines, NO, and ROS, and by activating systems of antioxidants and cell wall-degrading enzymes. The present study not only revealed the mechanism by which low concentrations of L-arginine increase the pathogenicity of A. alternata, but also provided a theoretical basis for the exclusive and precise targeting of A. alternata in kiwifruit."
