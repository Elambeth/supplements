      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIM: Patients with an ileostomy are at increased risk of dehydration and sodium depletion. Treatments recommended may include oral rehydration solutions (ORS). We aimed to investigate if protein type or protein hydrolysation affects absorption from iso-osmolar ORS in patients with an ileostomy. METHODS: This was a randomised, double-blinded, active comparator-controlled 3 × 3 crossover intervention study. We developed three protein-based ORS with whey protein isolate, caseinate or whey protein hydrolysate. The solutions contained 40-48 g protein/L, 34-45 mmol sodium/L and had an osmolality of 248-270 mOsm/kg. The patients ingested 500 mL/d. The study consisted of three 4-week periods with a >2-week washout between each intervention. The primary outcome was wet-weight ileostomy output. Ileostomy output and urine were collected for a 24-h period before and after each intervention. Additionally, blood sampling, dietary records, muscle-strength tests, bioimpedance analyses, questionnaires and psychometric tests were conducted. RESULTS: We included 14 patients, of whom 13 completed at least one intervention. Ten patients completed all three interventions. Wet-weight ileostomy output did not change following either of the three interventions and did not differ between interventions (p = 0.38). A cluster of statistically significant improvements related to absorption was observed following the intake of whey protein isolate ORS, including decreased faecal losses of energy (-365 kJ/d, 95% confidence interval (CI), -643 to -87, p = 0.012), potassium (-7.8 mmol/L, 95%CI, -12.0 to -3.6, p = 0.001), magnesium (-4.0 mmol/L, 95%CI, -7.4 to -0.7, p = 0.020), improved plasma aldosterone (-4674 pmol/L 95%CI, -8536 to -812, p = 0.019), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (2.8 mL/min/1.73 m2, 95%CI, 0.3 to 5.4, p = 0.03) and CO2 (1.7 mmol/L 95%CI, 0.1 to 3.3, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Ingestion of 500 mL/d of iso-osmolar solutions containing either whey protein isolate, caseinate or whey protein hydrolysate for four weeks resulted in unchanged and comparable ileostomy outputs in patients with an ileostomy. Following whey protein isolate ORS, we observed discrete improvements in a series of absorption proxies in both faeces and blood, indicating increased absorption. The protein-based ORS were safe and well-tolerated. Treatments should be tailored to each patient, and future studies are warranted to explore treatment-effect heterogeneity and whether different compositions or doses of ORS can improve absorption and nutritional status in patients with an ileostomy.

      "abstract": "Quantifying the water and mineral losses in feces is essential to determine the optimal composition of oral rehydration solutions (ORS) for diarrheic animals. In a randomized complete block design, this study evaluated water, mineral, and blood acid-base balance of calves with naturally occurring diarrhea receiving ORS or a placebo. On d 0, 45 calves (age: 18 ± 3.2 d; mean ± SD) were selected based on the presence of visual signs of diarrhea, such as dirty tail or wet feces, along with clinical symptoms evaluated by measuring the skin turgor and the degree of enophthalmos. On d 1, calves were divided into blocks of 3 animals based on blood base excess (BE) measured at 0900 h, and within each block, calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments (15 calves per treatment) including (1) a hypertonic ORS (HYPER; Na+ = 110 mmol/L; 370 mOsm/kg; strong ion difference [SID] = 60 mEq/L), (2) a hypotonic ORS with low Na+ (HYPO; Na+ = 77 mmol/L; 278 mOsm/kg; SID = 71 mEq/L), and (3) a placebo consisting of lukewarm water with 5 g/L of whey powder (CON). Milk replacer (MR) was fed through teat buckets twice daily at 0630 h and 1700 h in 2 equally sized meals of 2.5 L from d 1 to 3 and of 3.0 L on d 4 and 5. Treatments consisting of 2.0 L lukewarm solutions were administered between milk meals from d 1 to 3 at 1200 h and 2030 h through teat buckets. Refusals of MR and treatments were recorded daily, and blood samples were collected from the jugular vein once daily at arrival in the afternoon of d 0 and at 0900 h from d 1 to 5 after arrival. Urine and feces were collected quantitatively over a 48-h period from 1200 h on d 1 to 1200 h on d 3, and a representative sample of each 24-h period was stored. In addition, the volume of extracellular fluid was evaluated on d 2 by postprandial sampling over a 4-h period relative to the injection of sodium thiosulfate at 1300 h. Total daily fluid intake (MR, treatment, and water) from d 1 to 3 was greater in HYPER (LSM ± SEM; 8.9 ± 0.36 L/d) and HYPO (7.8 ± 0.34 L/d) than in CON (6.6 ± 0.34 L/d). This resulted in a greater water balance (water intake - fluid output in urine and feces) in calves receiving ORS (59.6 ± 6.28 g/kg BW per 24 h vs. 39.6 ± 6.08 g/kg BW per 24 h). Fecal Na+ losses were greater in HYPER than in the other treatments (81 ± 12.0 mg/kg BW per 24 h vs. 24 ± 11.8 mg/kg BW per 24 h). Blood pH was higher in HYPO (7.41 ± 0.016) than CON (7.35 ± 0.016) over the 5 monitoring days, whereas HYPER (7.37 ± 0.017) did not differ with other treatments. In this experimental model, diarrheic calves were likely unable to absorb the high Na+ load from HYPER, resulting in greater Na+ losses in feces, which might have impaired the alkalinizing capacity of HYPER. In contrast, HYPO significantly sustained blood acid-base balance compared with CON, whereas HYPER did not. This suggests that low tonicity ORS with a high SID are more suitable for diarrheic calves.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A historical turning point occurred in the treatment of diarrhea when it was discovered that glucose could enhance intestinal sodium and water absorption. Adding glucose to salt water (oral rehydration solution, ORS) more efficiently replaced intestinal water and salt losses. AIM: Provide a novel hypothesis to explain why mainstream use of ORS has been strongly recommended, but weakly adopted. METHODS: Traditional (absorptive) and novel (secretory) physiological functions of glucose in an ORS were reviewed. RESULTS: Small amounts of glucose can stimulate both intestinal absorption and secretion. Glucose can exacerbate a net secretory state and may aggravate pathogen-induced diarrhea, particularly for pathogens that affect glucose transport. CONCLUSION: A hypothesis is made to explain why glucose-based ORS does not appreciably reduce diarrheal stool volume and why modern food science initiatives should focus on ORS formulations that replace water and electrolytes while also reducing stool volume and duration of diarrhea.",

      "abstract": "Recommendations for composition of oral rehydration solutions (ORS) for calves, particularly concerning Na+ , glucose, and their combined effect on tonicity, are not in line with guidelines for humans. Thus, this study aimed to determine the effect of ORS tonicity on water, mineral and acid-base balance. Seventy-two calves were selected based on the severity of dehydration and blood base excess (BE) on day 0. Five calves that did not develop diarrhoea were removed post-inclusion from the study. Calves were allocated to blocks of four animals based on blood BE on day 1. Within each block, calves were randomly assigned to one of four treatments: (a) hypotonic ORS with low Na+ and lactose (HYPO); (b) isotonic ORS with low Na+ and glucose (ISO); (c) hypertonic ORS with high Na+ and glucose (HYPER); and (d) control consisting of warm water including 5 g/L of whey powder (CON). Treatments were administered twice daily over a 3-day period, in which calves were offered 2.0 L of treatment at 1300 and 2100 hr. Calves were fed 2.5 L of milk replacer at 0700 and 1630 hr from day 1 to 3 and 3.0 L from day 4 to 5, and had access to water. Calves were monitored for 5 days in which measurements included intakes, BW, blood sampling and collection of faeces on day 1 and urine from day 1 to 3. All ORS treatments maintained normal serum Na+ , whereas CON did not. Calves in the HYPER group had lower blood pH and greater faecal Na+ losses than HYPO and ISO. Plasma expansion relative to baseline was higher in low tonicity ORS (+4.8%) when compared with CON (+1.0%). Urine osmolality was 30% higher in HYPER calves. In this experiment, low tonicity ORS were more effective at restoring water, mineral and acid-base balance than the hypertonic ORS.",

However, it is unclear how many ORS products comply with current World Health Organization (WHO) osmolality guidelines and the osmotic shelf-life stability is not known. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to examine the within and between ORS product osmolality variation in both pre-mixed and reconstituted powders. Additionally, the osmotic stability was examined over time. The osmolality of five different pre-mixed solutions and six powdered ORS products were measured. Pre-mixed solutions were stored at room temperatures and elevated temperatures (31 °C) for two months to examine osmotic shelf stability. Results demonstrated that only one pre-mixed ORS product was in compliance with the current guidelines both before and after the prolonged storage. Five of the six powdered ORS products were in compliance with minimal inter-packet variation observed within the given formulations. This investigation demonstrates that many commercially available pre-mixed ORS products do not currently adhere to the WHO recommended osmolality guidelines. Additionally, due to the presence of particular sugars and possibly other ingredients, the shelf-life stability of osmolality for certain ORS products may be questioned. These findings should be carefully considered in the design of future ORS products.",

Oral rehydration solutions (ORSs) have the ability to supplement or reduce HPN dependence. However, ORSs have suffered from poor taste profiles, making long-term consumption and compliance unlikely. The goal of the current study was to assess the taste and compliance of 2 ORSs among patients with SBS requiring HPN. METHODS: All participants with SBS receiving HPN with anticipated duration >3 months were offered enrollment: 31 participants met inclusion criteria; 3 declined enrollment; and 28 were randomized to receive a modified World Health Organization ORS (group A) or a commercially available ORS (DripDrop; group B). RESULTS: Six participants dropped out shortly after randomization (3 in each group) due to poor taste or intolerance. An additional 3 (1 in group A and 2 in group B) discontinued the ORS before the end of the study at 6 months. At the end of the study, 19 remained. The mean taste rating given by the participants was, on a scale of 1-10, 7.3 ± 1.9 for group A and 7.6 ± 1.6 for group B ( P = .61). The mean number of days that ORSs were consumed each week was 6.0 ± 1.3 for group A and 6.6 ± 1 days for group B ( P = .06). CONCLUSION: Taste rating was not different for both ORSs; however, a significant number of participants did not complete the study.",

METHODS: From July to September 2008, in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with formal health care providers; open-ended interviews were conducted with informal health care providers; and focus group discussions and pile sorting were carried out with community caregivers. RESULT: The study participants attributed episodes of diarrhea in children to culturally recognized or folk ailments (empacho, cuajo, and varillas) that are primarily treated by traditional healers. There were knowledge deficits about 1) dehydration as a manifestation of diarrhea, and 2) management of dehydration, including the use of ORS and the need to continue feedings during diarrheal episodes. Caregivers perceived bottled/ready-made ORS products and the more expensive over-the-counter antidiarrheal medications as superior to ORS packets in the treatment of diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS: In Guatemala, folk etiologies of disease differ from those of the biomedical establishment and influence the decisions made by caregivers when treating ill children, including those related to the use of ORS. Public health campaigns addressing the treatment and management of diarrheal diseases in Santa Rosa should recognize the ailments known as empacho, cuajo, and varillas and target them for ORS use by community caregivers as well as health care providers in both the formal and informal health sectors.",

Rehydration constitutes the primary treatment of the systemic effects of burns and is a major factor in patient recovery. The standard of care for the replenishment of fluid and electrolyte losses in burn injury remains intravenous fluid therapy, but oral rehydration solution therapy (ORST) demonstrates beneficial utility in saving the lives of burn patients when they are applied in the acute phase of burn injuries, especially when intravenous rehydration is unavailable or inaccessible. Advantages of ORST as compared to intravenous therapy include availability, ease of administration in the field, low risk of infections and complications, low cost, and no requirement for accessory or specialized equipment. These benefits position ORST very attractively for the provision of interim first aid until definitive medical assistance arrives. Extensive and comprehensive investigation may be warranted to elucidate, account for and quantify individual burn patient biochemical variables toward the potential realization of such an \"omniuse\" oral rehydration solution for the benefit of burn injuries worldwide."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diarrheal disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children under five. Although oral rehydration solution (ORS) has tremendous therapeutic benefits, coverage of and demand for this product have remained low in many developing countries. This study surveyed caregivers and health care providers in India and Kenya to gather information about perceptions and use of various diarrhea treatments, assess reasons for low ORS use, and identify opportunities for expanding ORS use. METHODS: The project team conducted two rounds of semi-structured, quantitative surveys with more than 2000 caregivers in India and Kenya in 2012. A complementary survey covered more than 500 pharmacy staff and health care workers in both countries. In Kenya, the team also surveyed rural pharmacies to gather pricing and sales data. RESULTS: Although caregivers generally had very positive perceptions of ORS, they typically ranked antibiotics ahead of ORS as the strongest medicine for diarrhea (in India 62% ranked antibiotics first and 23% ranked ORS first, n = 404; in Kenya results were 55% and 29%, n = 401). Many caregivers had misconceptions about the purpose and effectiveness of various treatments. For example, most caregivers who gave ORS at last episode expected it to stop their child's diarrhea (65% in India, n = 190; 73% in Kenya, n = 154). There were noteworthy differences between India and Kenya in the selection and sourcing of treatments. Much of the money spent by families during the last episode of diarrhea was for inappropriate treatments. This was especially true in India, where rural households typically spent US$ 2.29 (median for the 79% of rural households that paid for health care services or treatments, n = 199) with most of this going to pay fees of private health workers and/or for antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers' primary treatment goal is to stop diarrhea, and many believe that antibiotics or ORS will accomplish this goal. Inappropriate treatment - and especially overuse of antibiotics - is common. Satisfaction with ORS is high, but dosing is a challenge for caregivers. The results provide valuable insight into treatment behaviors and suggest significant opportunities to enhance use of ORS in developing countries."

SETTING: Emergency department of a tertiary care pediatric hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-six children aged 5 to 10 years with concerns unrelated to the gastrointestinal tract. Intervention Each participant consumed as much of each solution as they desired during a 15-minute period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was each child's rating of taste as measured on a 100-mm visual analog scale (worst taste, 0 mm; best taste, 100 mm). Secondary outcome measures were volume consumed, willingness to consume each liquid again, and the most favored liquid. RESULTS: All enrolled patients completed all 3 study periods. A significant carryover effect was detected for taste scores (P=.03), which were significantly different with and without adjustment for the carryover effect (P<.001). Unadjusted values were 65 mm for Pedialyte, 58 mm for Pediatric Electrolyte, and 23 mm for Enfalyte. Differences in mean volume consumed were not significant (Enfalyte, 15 mL; Pediatric Electrolyte, 17 mL; and Pedialyte, 22 mL [P=.44]). The proportion of children who would drink each solution in the future varied significantly between Enfalyte and Pediatric Electrolyte (odds ratio, 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.46) and between Enfalyte and Pedialyte (0.38; 0.25-0.57). There were differences in the identification of the best-tasting solution, with Pedialyte selected by 35 of 66 children (53%), Pediatric Electrolyte by 26 of 66 children (39%), and Enfalyte by 5 of 66 children (8%) (P<.001). CONCLUSION: Sucralose-sweetened oral rehydration solutions (Pedialyte and Pediatric Electrolyte) were significantly more palatable than was a comparable rice-based solution (Enfalyte).

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Patient adherence to therapeutic regimens is extremely important to successful treatment. Among paediatric patients medication palatability of oral solutions is essential for patient acceptance, therapeutic compliance and successful outcome. The objective was to assess the palatability of different oral rehydration solutions (ORS), which flavour the children preferred and the relationship between the tastes of the child and the flavour chosen. They had been asked previously about their likings. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Randomised, multicentre, single blind clinical trial. A total of 116 children tasted four solutions, two at a time, and scored each flavour as really good, good, bad or really bad, and in each of the two tastings chose their preferred choice. RESULTS: The flavours that children preferred were cola (rated as good or really good by 87.9%) and strawberry (62.1%). In 97 of tastings, the flavour of choice was cola and in 62 strawberry, fruit in 26 and in 39 the neutral taste. There was an association between children who liked cola drinks and preferred the ORS cola flavoured (aOR: 10.3; 95%CI: 3.1-34.6). No relationship was found between children who preferred the strawberry flavoured ORS and their likings. Of the 7 children who did not like either cola drinks or strawberry sweets, 5 preferred the neutral solution. CONCLUSIONS: There are large variations in the acceptance of different flavours of ORS. Asking for children's tastes can lead towards the acceptance of the solutions.",

      "abstract": "The use of oral rehydration solution (ORS) has revolutionized the management of acute diarrhea. The implementation of the standard World Health Organization ORS (WHO-ORS) has resulted in decreased mortality associated with acute diarrheal illnesses in children, although in general stool volume and diarrhea durations are not reduced. Decreased morbidity and mortality have occurred because of improved hydration status. Decreased morbidity has also been described in adults who used this therapy. Various modifications to the standard ORS have been derived. These modifications have included hypo-osmolar or hyperosmolar solutions, use of rice-based ORS, zinc supplementation, and the use of amino acids, including glycine, alanine, and glutamine. Some of these variations have been successful, some have not, and others are still under investigation. ORS has been used for travelers' diarrhea and to decrease intravenous (IV) fluid requirements in patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS) who require parenteral nutrition (PN). This paper reviews the standard WHO-ORS and its mechanism of action, followed by more contemporary reduced osmolarity ORS and rice-based ORS in non-cholera diarrhea. Various modifications to improve ORS are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of oral rehydration solutions (ORS) on milk clotting, abomasal pH, electrolyte concentrations, and osmolality, as well as on the acid-base status in blood of suckling calves, as treatment with ORS is the most common therapy of diarrhea in calves to correct dehydration and metabolic acidosis. Oral rehydration solutions are suspected to inhibit abomasal clotting of milk; however, it is recommended to continue feeding cow's milk or milk replacer (MR) to diarrheic calves to prevent body weight losses. Three calves with abomasal cannulas were fed MR, MR-ORS mixtures, or water-ORS mixtures, respectively. Samples of abomasal fluid were taken before and after feeding at various time points, and pH, electrolyte concentrations, and osmolality were measured. The interference of ORS with milk clotting was examined in vivo and in vitro. To evaluate the effects of ORS on systemic acid-base status, the Stewart variables strong ion difference ([SID]), acid total ([A(tot)]), and partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) were quantified in venous blood samples drawn before and after feeding. Calves reached higher abomasal pH values when fed with MR-ORS mixtures than when fed MR. Preprandial pH values were re-established after 4 to 6 h. Oral rehydration solutions prepared in water increased the abomasal fluid pH only for 1 to 2 h. Oral rehydration solutions with high [SID(3)] ([Na(+)] + [K(+)] - [Cl(-)]) values produced significantly higher abomasal pH values and area under the curve data of the pH time course. Caseinomacropeptide, an indicator of successful enzymatic milk clotting, could be identified in every sample of abomasal fluid after feeding MR-ORS mixtures. The MR-ORS mixtures with [SID(3)] values > or =92 mmol/L increased serum [SID(3)] but did not change venous blood pH. Oral rehydration solutions do not interfere with milk clotting in the abomasum and can, therefore, be administered with milk. In this study, MR-ORS mixtures with high [SID(3)] values caused an increase of serum [SID(3)] in healthy suckling calves and may be an effective treatment for metabolic acidosis in calves suffering from diarrhea.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Assess the safety of rapid intravenous rehydration of severely malnourished children and compare the efficacy of 3 formulations of oral rehydration salts solutions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A group of 175 severely malnourished children of either sex (weight/length <70% of National Center for Health Statistics median), ages 6 to 36 months with cholera, were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 oral rehydration solutions (ORSs): glucose-ORS (n=58), glucose-ORS plus 50 g/L of amylase-resistant starch (n=59), or rice-ORS (n=58). Severely dehydrated children at enrollment were administered 100 mL/kg of an intravenous solution for 4 to 6 hours before randomisation, and those with some dehydration were randomised on enrollment. The electrolytes of the 3 ORSs were identical. In acute and convalescence phases, treatment was similar other than the nature of the ORSs. RESULTS: Intravenous fluid (mean) administered to 149 study children was 103 mL/kg (95% confidence interval [CI] 96-109), and all were rehydrated within 6 hours. None of them developed overhydration or heart failure. During the first 24 hours, stool output (31%; 95% CI 14%-42%; P=0.004) and the ORS intake (26%; 95% CI 12%-37%; P=0.002) of children receiving rice-ORS were significantly less compared with children receiving glucose-ORS. The mean duration of diarrhoea in all children (66 hours; 95% CI 62-71), and time to attain 80% of median weight/length (7.15+/-2.81 days) were not different. CONCLUSIONS: Dehydration in severely malnourished children can safely be corrected within 6 hours. All study ORSs were equally efficient in correcting dehydration. Rice-ORS significantly reduced the stool output and ORS intake, confirming previous reports.",

Six male Holstein-Friesian calves with abomasal cannulae, 5 to 13 d of age, were used in a crossover design. Calves were fed 2 L of cow's milk alone, milk with an ORT solution containing a low bicarbonate concentration (25 mmol/L), acetate (12 mmol/L), citrate (12 mmol/L), and glycine (7 mmol/L; group BACG), or milk with an ORT solution containing formate (58 mmol/L) and acetate (15 mmol/L) in randomized order. Clotting of milk was assessed in vivo and in vitro. Abomasal luminal pH was monitored continuously. Abomasal emptying rates were determined by using the change in abomasal luminal pH, acetaminophen absorption, and glucose absorption. The addition of a BACG-ORT solution to cow's milk increased in vitro clotting time by approximately 6 min. All 3 test solutions clotted in vivo by 15 min after the beginning of suckling. The addition of a BACG-ORT solution to cow's milk increased the pH of cow's milk and abomasal fluid by approximately 0.3 pH units. The addition of a BACG-ORT or a formate and acetate-ORT solution to cow's milk increased solution osmolality and slowed the rate of abomasal emptying. We concluded that the addition of BACG-ORT solution to cow's milk did not affect milk clotting in vivo. Recommendations based on the results of in vitro studies that bicarbonate- or citrate-containing ORT solutions should not be fed concurrently with cow's milk do not appear to be relevant to in vivo conditions when 2 L of a low-bicarbonate (25 mmol/L), low-citrate (12 mmol/L) ORT solution is fed.",

Breast feeding should be continued if going on. In cases of bottle feeding, milk should be reintroduced after a few hours of rehydration.

Successful oral rehydration therapy involves early use of ORS with maintenance or timely resumption of regular feeding. Since the inception of the oral rehydration approach more than three decades ago, the widespread use of ORS solutions has revolutionized the management and outcomes of acute gastroenteritis in children and adults. The efficacy of the World Health Organization ORS solution and of commercial ORS formulations has been enhanced by reducing osmolarity. Newer formulations of ORS are under active investigation, with promise of added benefits, including promotion of intestinal healing. This article reviews fluid and electrolyte transport in the gastrointestinal tract, the pathophysiologic mechanisms of acute diarrhea, and the basis and formulation of current and newer ORS solutions.

      "abstract": "Zinc has been recognized as an antioxidant with potential for chronic and acute effects. Oxidative damage produced by free radicals, including nitric oxide (NO), is responsible for certain types of intestinal malabsorption syndromes and diarrhea. Under physiologic or mildly stimulatory conditions for NO synthesis, the small intestine characteristically is in a proabsorptive state; however, an excessive production of NO triggers formation of cyclic nucleotides, which cause secretion and malabsorption. In this study, we hypothesized that low-molecular-weight, soluble zinc chelates could modulate the effects of induced NO excess on the small intestine. In vitro experiments demonstrated that zinc-citrate or zinc-histidine at > or =0.66 mM, as well as a known NO scavenger, 2-[carboxyphenyl]-4,4,4,4-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide, at 2 microM, were effective at removing chemically generated NO. In vivo jejunal perfusions, conducted in healthy rats under anesthesia, showed that c-PTIO reduced the proabsorptive effects produced by 1 mM L-arginine, the precursor of NO. In a standard oral rehydration solution, 1 mM zinc-citrate partially reversed the antiabsorptive effects on potassium caused by an excess of NO generated from 20 mM L-arginine but did not alter sodium or water absorption. The data are consistent with the view that soluble zinc compounds incorporated into an oral rehydration solution may deserve further attention as a means to scavenge NO with fluids used for the treatment of chronic or acute diarrhea, especially in malnourished children who are often zinc deficient.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Zinc deficiency is associated with chronic diarrhea. This condition is generally linked to an overproduction of nitric oxide (NO), which induces secretion and cellular damage as a free radical. Use of oral rehydration solutions (ORS) is an important part of diarrhea treatment, especially early in infancy and for patients with cholera. The presence of zinc in an ORS could be a positive factor in recovery from diarrheal disease. OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to determine whether zinc added to an ORS could regulate the synthesis of NO metabolites in the lumen of zinc deficient rat intestine, acting as a gastrointestinal protector and thus accelerating normalization of intestinal function and zinc status. METHODS: The effects of zinc on NO metabolism were studied in young male rats fed a zinc deficient diet for three weeks to mimic the condition of patients with recurrent diarrheal episodes. During the fourth week of the zinc deficient feedings, experimental diarrhea was induced using cathartics (magnesium citrate plus phenolphthalein) that exacerbate NO production. A standard ORS with or without 1 mM zinc was given to the rats for the last two days. A control group received a zinc sufficient diet. Rats were killed at each stage. Intestinal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) was assayed, cecal fluid contents were analyzed for nitrates and nitrites, intestinal histology was examined, and activation of nuclear factor NF-kappaB DNA binding activity was determined. RESULTS: Rats fed the zinc-deficient diet for three weeks gained less weight than rats fed a normal zinc content diet and had a lower plasma zinc than controls (51.6 +/- 5.4 [n = 101 vs. 143.6 +/- 7.2 microg/dL [n = 11], p < 0.05). Recovery with ORS+Zn resulted in a higher plasma zinc than with the ORS-Zn (ORS+Zn: 186.5 +/- 12.2; ORS-Zn: 57.5 +/- 6.6 microg/dL, p < 0.05). The zinc-deficient diet did not alter mucosal NOS, as compared to the values of rats fed a normal diet. However, those animals which received five days of cathartic fluids had a small intestinal NOS higher than that of all other groups. Either ORS+Zn or ORS-Zn normalized NOS activity, regardless of cathartic treatment. The rats fed the zinc deficient diet had generally a higher content of NO metabolites in the cecum than rats fed a normal diet. After recovery with either type of ORS, rats given the cathartic remained with higher cecal NO metabolite concentrations than rats that had no induced diarrhea. After recovery with ORS+Zn, intestinal villi showed significant expansion of the lamina propria, an indication of greater absorption of fluid, while with ORS-Zn this was not present. Small intestinal homogenates of rats recovering with ORS+Zn had a decreased NF-kappaB DNA binding activity than tissues from rats consuming ORS-Zn. CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with the hypothesis that addition of Zn to an ORS may contribute to improving the physiologic status of the small intestine and potentially reduce the risks of recurrent diarrhea episodes.",

In total, 120 children were evaluated for the study, of whom 58 patients were positive for Vibrio cholerae and were included in the study. Of these 58 cases, 19 received rice-based hypo-osmolar ORS, 20 received WHO-ORS and 19 received glucose-based hypo-osmolar ORS. The clinical characteristics (age, preadmission duration of diarrhoea, frequency of stool before admission, incidence of vomiting, body weight and volume of initial fluid requirement) were comparable in the three treatment groups. All patients received tetracycline in a dose of 50 mg/kg/d of body weight in 4 divided doses for 3 d. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received rice-based hypo-osmolar ORS had subsequently reduced (p < 0.05) stool output, ORS consumption and diarrhoea duration than the patients who received either WHO-ORS or glucose-based hypo-osmolar ORS.",

Conflicting or anecdotal results obtained thus far could be clarified with a standardized preparation tested under well-controlled laboratory conditions. METHODS: A modified commercial tapioca starch was tested. Textra (National Starch and Chemical Co. Bridgewater, NJ, U.S.A.) added at 0, 5 or 10 g/l to an oral rehydration solution with 90 mM sodium and 111 mM glucose, in 30 rats malnourished by a protein-deficient diet for 3 weeks and in 26 well-fed control animals, using a one-pass jejunal perfusion. RESULTS: In protein-deficient rats, Textra stimulated sodium absorption at 5 and 10 g/l (mean +/- SEM); 0 g/l Textra: 160 +/- 13 nmol/min x cm; 5 g/l Textra: 406 +/- 31 (p < 0.0001); and 10 g/l Textra 230 +/- 27 (p < 0.02). Potassium absorption was comparably increased. Textra also improved net water absorption and the water influx:efflux ratio. Glucose absorption was increased only at 10 g/l Textra. In control rats, Textra improved sodium and net water absorption at 5 g/l, but not at 10 g/l Textra; but the influx:efflux ratio and potassium absorption were unaltered. CONCLUSIONS: These data, obtained in normal and protein-deficient rats, support the view that modified starch is a potentially useful, energy-rich additive for oral rehydration solution, which does not introduce an osmotic penalty.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Parents may be deterred from obtaining commercial oral rehydration solutions (ORS) for their young children with acute diarrheal disease because of its availability and/or cost, especially if they are poor. We conducted a randomized clinical trial to determine 1) whether low-income parents could safely mix and administer cereal-based ORS (CBORS) both from ingredients commonly found in the home and from a premixed packet; 2) whether these CBORS were as effective in maintaining hydration as commercial glucose-based ORS; and 3) whether CBORS were more effective in reducing severity and duration of illness. METHODS: Children 4 to 36 months of age discharged from emergency departments and health centers with acute diarrheal disease were randomized to receive either homemade CBORS, reconstituted packet CBORS, or Pedialyte. A study nurse saw the child at home each day until the illness resolved, and obtained capillary blood for serum sodium at enrollment and at 24 to 48 hours; a sample of CBORS for sodium concentration; stool for pathogen analysis; and daily fluid intake, stool frequency, and weight. RESULTS: A total of 232 children were enrolled, of whom 203 (88%) completed the study. Two parents (3%) in the homemade CBORS group and one parent (1%) in the packet CBORS group made mixing errors resulting in a high sodium concentration (>100 mEq/L); their children refused the solution and had normal serum sodium values. Mean CBORS sodium concentration for the remainder of the homemade CBORS group was 60 +/- 10 mEq/L, and for the packet CBORS group, 54 +/- 13. Eighteen children (11%) had abnormal serum sodium values at presentation, which returned to normal in all groups in most cases. Three children (4.5%) in the homemade CBORS group, 4 (6%) in the packet CBORS group, and 1 child (1.4%) in the Pedialyte group failed therapy. Children refused to take homemade CBORS and packet CBORS (43% and 32%, respectively) more often than Pedialyte (9%), and those in the CBORS groups tended to take less ORS and total fluids. There were no significant differences among the three groups in incidence of daily vomiting or stooling, duration of diarrhea, or weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: CBORS do not offer a clinically significant advantage over glucose-based ORS. Homemade CBORS represent a treatment option in carefully selected cases, but it is not the safest alternative for regular clinical use.",

Additionally, it is determined if presenting rice-based ORS as a solution that would help stop diarrhoea (Oresol-K) enhanced its acceptability. A total of 437 non-dehydrated children aged less than five years presenting to health centres with acute diarrhoea were randomly assigned to the three ORS groups. Acceptability was determined by the amounts of ORS consumed at home by children still with diarrhoea on 24- or 48-hour follow-up. The amounts of ORS consumed by children given Oresol-R (54 [95% CL 38-70] mL/kg/24 h) and Oresol-F (47 [24-70]) were similar to the amount of Oresol-G (44 [32-56]). ORS consumption was not affected by the child's age, nutritional status, feeding before the episode, duration of diarrhoea at health centre visit, maternal education and previous ORS use. Informing the caretaker that rice-based ORS would help stop diarrhoea did not lead to increased consumption of the solution (Oresol-R 54 [38-70] mL/kg/24 h; Oresol-K 50 [32-68]). Solution preparation was likewise similar among the treatment groups. Reactions to the different ORS types were generally favourable but did not differ between the groups.",

      "abstract": "Previously we reported that standard oral rehydration salts (ORS) solution is not as effective as a reduced-osmolarity glucose-based ORS for the treatment of children with acute noncholera diarrhoea: with standard ORS the diarrhoea lasts longer, stool output is greater, serum sodium is higher, and there is more need for supplemental intravenous infusion. We studied a reduced-osmolarity maltodextrin (MD)-based ORS to determine whether it had similar benefits, and also the effect of sugar malabsorption on the efficacy of standard and MD-based ORS. A total of 90 boys aged 3-24 months with acute noncholera diarrhoea and moderate dehydration were randomly assigned to either standard ORS (glucose 20 g/l, osmolarity 311 mmol/l) or MD-ORS (MD 50 g/l, osmolarity 227 mmol/l). There were no differences in treatment results. Some 46% of subjects had a high total stool output (> 300 g/kg), which was unrelated to the type of ORS given. High stool output was significantly associated with a longer duration of diarrhoea (33 vs. 15 hours; P < 0.001), a persistently elevated serum sodium (149 vs. 144 mmol/l at 24 h; P < 0.02), the need for intravenous infusion (11/41 vs. 0/48; P < 0.002), and an increase in faecal reducing substances (10.8 vs. 3.4 g/l at 24 h; P < 0.001). We conclude that some children given standard ORS develop osmotic diarrhoea owing to the combined effect of transient sugar malabsorption and slight hypertonicity of the ORS. Earlier studies show that this adverse outcome can largely be avoided when extra water is given in reduced-osmolarity glucose-based ORS. Reduced osmolarity has no benefit, however, when glucose is replaced by maltodextrin, probably because the sugars released by hydrolysis of MD, when malabsorbed, raise the intraluminal osmolarity to equal or exceed that of standard ORS. Thus, reduced-osmolarity glucose-based ORS is superior to both standard ORS and reduced-osmolarity solutions based on maltodextrin and probably other complex carbohydrates. Studies are in progress to define the optimal formulation of reduced-osmolarity glucose-based ORS.",

SUBJECTS: One hundred twenty male infants, > 1 month and < 1 year of age, with acute non-cholera diarrhea and dehydration were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups. METHODS: Patients were kept in a metabolic unit where body weight, ORS, water and food intake, as well as stool, urine and vomitus output were recorded at 6-hour intervals. Laboratory evaluation, including blood gases and electrolytes, were monitored during hospitalization. RESULTS: Diarrheal stool output, duration of diarrhea and volume of ORS required to achieve and maintain hydration was not significantly different between the treatment groups. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that a glutamine-based ORS did not provide any additional therapeutic advantage over the standard WHO-ORS during treatment of dehydration in infants with acute non-cholera diarrhea.",

It also attempted to test the importance of individual and contextual factors--especially mothers' knowledge--in explaining the administration of oral rehydration solutions. Data about the treatment of an episode of child diarrhea within the last three months were collected from large samples of mothers in seven sites in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The results showed that oral rehydration solutions were given in smaller volumes and for shorter periods of time than recommended. The majority of children received at least a glass (200-250 ml) of solution on the first day, but few received more than that. Daily administration of packet-based solutions or of sugar-salt solutions (promoted in two of the countries) during diarrhea was generally quite low, ranging from 16 to 60% of cases given an oral rehydration solution. However, in four out of six sites, at least half of the children with diarrhea for more than one day were given an oral rehydration solution for more than one day. The majority of children were given some form of other fluids (e.g. more water, special teas, or continued breastfeeding), but their value in preventing dehydration was not clear because the volume of other fluids given could not be assessed. Few of the hypothesized predictors of administration explained the variation in volume or duration of ORS/SSS administration within any specific country or across sites. The research points to the need for more information on the decision process used by mothers when treating their children's diarrhea and on outside factors influencing this process.",

Oral rehydration therapy, initially using glucose-based solutions and more recently cereal-based solutions, prevents complications and death from dehydration. These experiments compared the effect of these two rehydration solutions and a mixed meal on jejunal water and ionic transport. Five dogs had 25-cm proximal jejunal Thiry-Vella fistulae constructed. Following recovery, jejunal absorption studies (N = 40) were performed using an isotonic electrolyte solution containing [14C]PEG to calculate net fluxes of water, sodium, and chloride. Each study consisted of a 1-hr basal period, followed by a 3-hr experimental period. Each animal was randomly studied in each of four study groups: control, mixed meal, glucose-based and cereal-based rehydration solution. In the mixed meal, glucose-based, and cereal-based solution groups there were significant increases (P < 0.0001) in jejunal Thiry-Vella fistula water and ion absorption following the stimuli, in the absence of direct luminal nutrient contact with the Thiry-Vella fistula. There were no differences between the observed responses to the glucose-based or cereal-based rehydration solutions. Glucose-based and cereal-based rehydration solutions were equally effective in stimulating jejunal absorption of water and electrolytes, but less effective than a mixed meal. Both food and oral rehydration solutions appear to increase jejunal absorption partially via a neurohumoral mechanism that is independent of luminal nutrient contact with the Thiry-Vella fistula.",

Analysis of data indicated that Gastrolyte therapy resulted in significantly fewer episodes and volume of vomiting over all time periods in comparison to Glucolyte and significantly less stool volume during the first 8 h and in the 0-24 h period. The differences between treatments in degree of dehydration at each follow-up period, duration of diarrhoea, and duration of hospital stay were not significant. No adverse drug reactions occurred.

Our studies suggest that defined short-chain glucose polymers (2 to 9 glucose units) are hydrolyzed and absorbed faster than isocaloric solutions of D-glucose in the small intestine of the rat. Glucose polymers, primarily from rice-based solutions, have been shown to be as effective as glucose-based solutions. They offer additional advantages in reducing the amount and duration of diarrhea with lesser volumes of solution, thereby reducing the costs of treatment. Rice-based solutions provide high caloric density and increase the absorption of sodium without an osmotic overload. The result is increased net absorption of glucose, sodium, and water. Glucose polymers from rice or other starches in oral rehydration solutions may be effective, inexpensive, easily used, and safe treatments for acute diarrhea.",

Perfusion of the intestine with a standard cleansing solution (solution I, sodium 125, potassium 10, bicarbonate 20, sulphate 40, mannitol 80 mmol/l; 275 mOsm/kg) confirmed published data on minimal water and sodium absorption. Experimental solution VI produced maximum water absorption (mean (SE) +1660.0 (29.8) ml/h) significantly greater than solution II (+1195.3 (79.5) ml/h), III (+534.7 (140.3) ml/h), IV (+1498.0 (42.7) ml/h), and V (+1327.7 (24.4) ml/h; p less than 0.05). Sodium absorption was significantly greater with solution II (+97.4 (7.9) mmol/h) compared to VI (+43.3 (7.8) mmol/h; p less than 0.01) but not compared to IV (+67.2 (13.0) mmol/h). A hypotonic oral rehydration solution such as solution VI may provide optimal replacement treatment for patients with acute diarrhoea.",

      "abstract": "A total of 186 infants, suffering from acute diarrhea were studied and divided into two groups: 84 children were placed in group A and given the ORS recommended by the World Health Organization which contains sodium and glucose at concentrations of 60 and 90 mmol/L respectively and an osmolality of 311 mOsm/kg (mmol/kg) (ORS-90). Group B included 82 children who received an ORS containing sodium and glucose at concentrations of 60 and 90 mmol/L respectively and with an osmolality of 240 mOsm/kg (mmol/kg) (ORS-60). Seven belonging to group A (8.3%) required intravenous rehydration due to the severity of the diarrhea (three cases), persistent vomiting (three cases) and paralytic ileus (one case), while only two cases belonging to group B (2.5%) required intravenous rehydration due to severe losses through feces (one case) and another due to paralytic ileus (one case). No differences were observed due to the variations in sodium concentrations among either of the groups of patients, whether that be in the natremias when admitted or once rehydrated, with a general tendency towards the correction of the hypernatremia or hyponatremia seen during admittance with both types of ORS. A similar situation was observed with the variations in serum potassium. The results obtained from this study show the different advantages of using an ORS with lesser sodium and glucose concentrations as well as minor osmolality with those from using the solution recommended by the World Health Organization, when a lesser index of failures is observed in the treatment of children with acute diarrhea with oral rehydration therapy. Yet before widely recommending its' use, it should be demonstrated that the new ORS induces lesser losses through feces during the rehydrating period in children dehydrated due to acute diarrhea.",

      "abstract": "An open-label inpatient study is in progress to compare the efficacy and safety of two oral rehydration solutions in children and infants with acute diarrhea and mild to moderate dehydration. One solution (ORS-60) contains 60 mmol/L of sodium and 1.8% glucose, with a total osmolality of 240 mosm/kg; the other (ORS-26) contains 26 mmol/L of sodium, 2.7% glucose, and 3.6% sucrose, with a total osmolality of 340 mosm/kg. An outcome analysis of 28 children with gastroenteritis indicated that ORS-60 (n = 13) reduced stool volume during the first eight hours after admission to a significantly greater (P less than 0.05) extent than did ORS-26 (n = 15). Diarrhea had ceased by 24 hours in 64% of ORS-60 patients but in only 31% of ORS-26 patients, and the patients' clinical condition was improved at eight hours in 84% of ORS-60 patients versus 60% of ORS-26 patients. Differences between treatments in degree of dehydration at each follow-up point, total duration of diarrhea, and duration of hospital stay were not detected. No adverse drug reactions occurred. Four patients received intravenous rehydration therapy, but none was considered a treatment failure. We conclude that the lower osmolar solution, ORS-60, conferred earlier recovery and reduced continuing fluid losses in the management of gastroenteritis.",

      "abstract": "Ideas about the optimal composition of oral rehydration solutions (ORS) continue to evolve. A controlled clinical trial is the only way to determine whether a new ORS is superior to an established solution, but attempts have been made to prescreen new ORS in a variety of animal models, most of which involve intestinal perfusion. Most of the work has been performed in the healthy small intestine of rats, either in short segments or in its entirety, or in the diseased small intestine that has been infected with rotavirus or exposed to cholera toxin to induce a secretory state. Despite the marked pathophysiologic differences between these models, the qualitative findings using new and established ORS have been remarkably similar. Overall, these animal models have emphasized the potential benefit of using a hypotonic ORS (osmolality, 240 mosm/kg or less). The optimal sodium concentration has been found to be 50 to 60 mmol/L, and the optimal glucose concentration 90 to 111 mmol/L. These models have also been satisfactorily used to examine the value of glucose polymer and food-based ORS. The findings suggest that for a given substrate load initial osmolality is probably the chief determinant of water absorption, which is substantially greater from the more hypotonic solutions. Results from animal experiments must be interpreted with caution because of their physiologic limitations. Nevertheless, they have provided insight into the physiology of oral rehydration therapy and may be useful in identifying ORS for evaluation by clinical trial.",

      "abstract": "Two oral rehydration solutions (ORS 1 and ORS 2) were evaluated in isolated intestinal loops of anaesthetised calves, in an experimental model of dehydration in the calf, in calves with experimentally induced diarrhoea and in 164 calves with clinical diarrhoea. The studies in isolated intestinal loops indicated that water absorption was significantly greater from ORS 2 than from ORS 1. After the intraperitoneal administration of hypertonic mannitol combined with intravenous diuretics, the plasma volume of calves was reduced by about 30 per cent, and was more rapidly expanded after treatment with ORS 2 than ORS 1. The plasma volume remained significantly reduced (P less than 0.01) three hours after dosing with ORS 1 whereas after treatment with ORS 2 it was not significantly different from the initial value. Acidosis was corrected to a significantly (P less than 0.01) greater extent after treatment with ORS 2, and peripheral perfusion also returned to normal more rapidly in calves given ORS 2. In newly purchased calves in which diarrhoea was induced experimentally with an E coli challenge, base deficit and diarrhoea were corrected more rapidly in the calves receiving ORS 2. When the solutions were tested in the treatment of 164 clinical cases of diarrhoea and dehydration there was no statistically significant difference in mortality between the formulations, although the overall mortality was 4.8 per cent in the calves treated with ORS 2, compared with 8.6 per cent in the calves treated with ORS 1. It was concluded that ORS 2 performed better than ORS 1 especially in the expansion of plasma volume and the correction of acidosis.",

Six patients who received rice powder electrolyte solution and seven who received glucose electrolyte solution re-attended for a repeat study with the same test meal 16 days later, when fully recovered from cholera. No differences in gastric emptying patterns of the two electrolyte solutions were observed, either in the acute or in the recovered patients. Similarly, gastric emptying of both solutions was rapid during acute cholera and comparable to that observed in recovered patients. This study indicates that gastric emptying is not impaired in acute cholera and that the rate of emptying of oral rehydration solutions is adequate to account for their observed clinical efficacy in fast purging patients with acute cholera.",

The clinical outcome, including ORS intake, prevention of dehydration, rehydration, and duration of hospital stay was similar in the three treatment groups. All initial electrolyte abnormalities were corrected; no child developed hypernatraemia or hyponatraemia. At 24 h, the mean serum urea was higher in those who received the ORS containing glycine than in other groups, and it had not fallen significantly since admission. Eighteen per cent of children had carbohydrate intolerance: four children with greater than or equal to 2% reducing substances in their stool had all received ORS with a high glucose content and had numerous watery green stools containing rotavirus. All ORS solutions were safe and effective for rehydration and correction of biochemical abnormalities, however carbohydrate intolerance was more prevalent in children who received the ORS with a high glucose content.",

An evaluation study based on over 7000 households enabled different usage rates to be calculated for four different diarrhoea types. The overall usage of LGS for all diarrhoea episodes was around 5-10% but for what the people called 'Severe Diarrhoeas' or cholera it was found to be between 25% and 52%.

      "abstract": "For patients suffering from mild to moderate dehydration, oral rehydration therapy has proved a simple and efficacious treatment. There remains, however, a need to develop improved oral rehydration solutions (ORS), and suitable experimental models are required to develop and assess new formulations. The ideal model for such investigations would take into account rates of gastric emptying, influx and efflux of water and solutes in the intestine, and the consequent changes in body composition. As no such definitive model is currently available, a variety of techniques are used to examine parts of the process of intestinal absorption. Clinical studies which assess the recovery of dehydrated patients during therapy using different ORS will ultimately evaluate the efficacy of treatment. However, ethical considerations, the relative insensitivity of this technique and the exacting nature of such studies make this approach unsuitable for the development of specific ORS. Gastric emptying of solutions can be determined by a variety of techniques, among which the radioactive tracer method offers the advantage of having no direct effect on the emptying rate, giving almost continuous measurement and allowing the use of relatively small volumes of fluids. Perfusion techniques allow measurement of the net flux of water and solute in predetermined sections of the intact human intestine. Measurement of the rate of accumulation in the circulation of orally ingested tracer molecules for water and solutes can estimate unidirectional flux. This method allows for the rates of gastric emptying and intestinal absorption of the test substance, but the rate of efflux of the tracer from the vascular space must be known to calculate net uptake. Each of these models has limitations, and care must be taken in interpreting the results in a clinical context. However, their use in the development of improved formulations is well established.",

      "abstract": "Controversy continues regarding the ideal composition of glucose/electrolyte solutions used for oral rehydration of infants and children with acute diarrhea. We have used cholera toxin-treated rat small intestine as a model of secretory diarrhea to assess the efficacy of oral rehydration solutions by intestinal perfusion. All solutions tested reversed net water secretion but a hypotonic bicarbonate-free solution was more effective than other solutions, including the World Health Organization oral rehydration solution (p less than 0.003). Net sodium secretion persisted with all solutions tested but there was a significant linear relationship between sodium concentration of the solution perfused and net sodium transport (r = 0.75, p less than 0.05). Cholera toxin treatment alone and in combination with perfusion of oral rehydration solutions significantly reduced plasma sodium concentration and osmolality (p less than 0.05), the effects being most marked with low sodium solutions. Although direct parallelism between observations in this animal model of secretory diarrhea and human diarrheal disease has not been established as yet, the model may be useful in assessing clinical efficacy of new oral rehydration solutions and in systematic analysis of the relative benefits of their individual components.",

Oral therapy was given until clinical signs of hydration status were normal. During the 48-hour trial, the following laboratory data were collected: blood gases, serum electrolytes, glucose, urea, and creatinine values and sodium and potassium concentrations in stool and urine; serial weights and clinical signs were also reported. Six of the 62 infants, three in each group, required intravenous fluids because of high stool output. Results of clinical outcome and normalization of altered serum electrolyte values were similar in both groups. During the 48-hour trial, eight patients in group A and four in group B had mild, asymptomatic hypernatremia.

The patients receiving ORS60-Gly110 had poor weight gain and increased stool and urine volumes after rehydration compared with the other two groups. The patients receiving ORS60-Gly60 had similar stool and urine volumes as those receiving standard ORS60. It is concluded that excess glycine in relation to sodium in an ORS may lead to osmotic diarrhoea, and a high amount of absorbed glycine may result in osmotic diuresis with poor net rehydration. Altogether, the present study failed to find any improvement ('Super-ORS') by addition of glycine to an ORS containing 60 mmol/l of sodium.",

A controlled, randomized study was thus conducted in 65 young infants hospitalized with acute noncholera dehydrating diarrhea. The study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of the standard WHO oral glucose-electrolyte solution containing 90 mmol of sodium per liter (Group A: 22 infants) with that of an oral glucose-electrolyte solution containing 60 mmol of sodium per liter (Group B: 22 infants) and with standard intravenous therapy (Group C: 21 infants). Among the 44 infants in Groups A and B, none required intravenous therapy. Dehydration, acidosis, and initial hyponatremia or hypokalemia were corrected with equal efficacy in all the three groups. In the critical first 8 h, the mean sodium absorption was significantly higher (p less than 0.01) in Group A. This resulted in hypernatremia (50%), periorbital edema (50%), mild pedal edema (27%), excessive irritability, and convulsions (4.5%). The mean serum sodium levels at 8, 24, and even 48 h were significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than those in Groups B and C. It is concluded that glucose-electrolyte oral solution containing 60 mmol of sodium per liter is as safe and effective as intravenous rehydration for the treatment of noncholera neonatal and early infantile diarrhea, while the standard WHO solution carries a significant risk of hypernatremia under similar conditions.",

Inocula of 10(5) unwashed organisms from broth culture were rapidly killed in ORS made with chlorinated tap water and increased by 1.5-2 log10 in ORS in triple-distilled laboratory water. When media constituents were first removed by washing, one strain failed to grow in ORS-distilled water, but multiplied to a level of 10(6) organisms/ml in ORS in water obtained from a rural village in the highlands of Guatemala. Multiplication of organisms in ORS depends on the presence of a nitrogen source. These limited data support current guidelines for preparation and use of ORS in the field employing available drinking water, as bacterial growth is restricted by the nitrogen content of the water.",

Several trials have shown that the solution proposed by the WHO for developing countries containing inter alia 90 mmol/l of sodium and 111 mmol/l of glucose is safe for short term oral rehydration. When used in this manner there is no risk for development of hypernatraemia. The surplus base of the solution is not essential and, furthermore, other anions e.g. acetate may be substitute for bicarbonate. Other modifications of the WHO formula have also been successfully tried, e.g. sucrose 4% (117 mmol/l) instead of glucose 2% (111 mmol/l). A somewhat lower concentration of sucrose may, however, prove to be better. Most acute childhood diarrhoeas are not mediated by enterotoxin and thus not of the secretory type, but temporary malabsorption is common. Therefore, the amount of carbohydrate in oral sugar-electrolyte mixtures should be limited. Osmotic diarrhoea due to carbohydrate malabsorption is a more likely cause of hypernatraemia in dehydrated children than too much dietary sodium. In developed countries prepacked oral sugar-electrolyte mixtures are mainly designed for moderately sick children treated at home. There is no reason to raise the carbohydrate content of these mixtures above that of the WHO formula, but the sodium content must be lower. For most situations in home treatment 50 mmol/l of sodium will be adequate.",

To formulate judicious recommendations for preparation and storage of such solutions, we assessed the capability of recognized bacterial enteropathogens to survive and proliferate in solutions made either with sterile distilled or river water collected in two developing countries. Shigella flexneri, an enteropathogen typically transmitted by faecal/oral contact rather than by water or food, survived very poorly. In contrast, Vibrio cholerae and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, pathogens classically associated with transmission by food and water, reached concentrations of 103-104 per ml by 12 h and 104-106 by 24 h after inoculation of solutions made with river water and somewhat lower concentrations in distilled water. This potential exposure to bacteria must be considered in the context of the field situation where children are already ingesting high levels of bacteria in drinking water and food and where the oral rehydration solution would probably add little to their exposure. Although it is probably wise to prepare solutions fresh each day with water as free from faecal pollution as possible, in situations where lack of fuel to boil water or scarce supply of glucose/electrolyte packets preclude compliance with these recommendations prompt administration of oral rehydration solutions to infants with diarrhoea should nevertheless proceed.",

      "abstract": "In a randomized double-blind trial, infants with mild or moderate diarrhoeal dehydration were rehydrated orally either with a simple solution containing table sugar and salt (without potassium or bicarbonate) or with a complete glucose/electrolyte formula. All 32 given glucose/electrolyte solution and 27 (93%) of 29 infants given sugar/salt were successfully rehydrated with similar improvement in metabolic acidosis and rapidity of rehydration. The drawbacks to oral therapy with simple sugar/salt solution were the frequent development of hypokalaemia and greater volume of vomiting during treatment. Carefully prepared sugar/salt solution, if accompanied by adequate potassium supplementation, may be used as an alternative to the preferred glucose/electrolyte formula when the latter is unavailable.",
