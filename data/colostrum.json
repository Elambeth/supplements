      "abstract": "This study evaluated the effects of a botanical supplement (a formulated proprietary blend of turmeric, capsicum, and black pepper oleoresin in a fat carrier; PHYT), fed pre- and post-calving, on colostrum and milk yield and the quality, passive transfer of immunity, and performance of cow-calf pairs. Twenty-three (BW = 532 ± 9.13 kg; age 36 mo) crossbred Angus cows were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: (1) not supplemented (CON, n = 7); (2) supplemented with 250 mg/head/day (PHYT250, n = 8); or (3) supplemented with 500 mg/head/day (PHYT500, n = 8) of the botanical supplement. The cows were individually fed the supplement from 30 days (±6 days) pre-calving to 60 days post-calving. Colostrum was collected on d 0 (pre-suckling), and d 1, d 2, and d 3 post-calving. The total milk from all quarters was collected 45 and 90 d post-calving and at weaning. Colostrum and milk volumes were recorded, and samples were analyzed for percentages of fat, protein, milk urea nitrogen, other solids, and lactose. Colostrum samples were analyzed for concentrations of IgG, IgA, and IgM, and milk samples were analyzed for IgG concentration using radial immunodiffusion. Blood samples were collected from dams and calves, and serum was analyzed for concentrations of IgG (cows and calves) and IgA (calves). Cow and calf BW were measured periodically until weaning. Supplementation with PHYT linearly increased fat in colostrum (CON = 3.29, PHIT250 = 4.23, and PHYT500 = 4.17 ± 0.77%; p = 0.05) and IgA in calf serum (96.91, 151.69, and 183.42 ± 29.78 mg/dL for CON, PHYT250, and PHYT500, respectively; p = 0.04) and tended to linearly increase concentrations of fat in milk (CON = 3.84, PHYT250 = 4.05, and PHYT500 = 4.71 ± 1.04%; p = 0.07), IgG in calf serum (2082.31; 2196.29; and 2577.78 ± 213.08 mg/dL for CON, PHYT250, and PHYT500, respectively; p = 0.09), and IgM in colostrum (CON = 179.04; PHYT250 = 170.79; PHYT500 = 218.30 ± 16.08 mg/dL; p = 0.09). A quadratic response was observed for calf ADG (p = 0.03), where CON (0.99 ± 0.03 kg/d) was less than PHYT250 (1.10 ± 0.03 kg/d), and intermediate values were observed for PHYT500 (1.01 ± 0.03 kg/d). In summary, supplementation with PHYT led to a linear increase in colostrum fat and IgA levels in calf serum. Additionally, supplementation tended to linearly elevate fat concentrations in milk, IgG levels in calf serum, and IgM levels in colostrum. Our results suggest that supplementing beef cows in late gestation and early lactation with 250 or 500 mg/head/d of PHYT improves colostrum quality and calf health and performance. Further investigation is needed to determine both the biological significance and the economic benefits of botanical additives in beef production."

      "abstract": "Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), characterized by severe fatty liver-associated inflammation and hepatocellular damage, is a major precursor to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. While the exact pathogenesis of NASH remains unclear, gut microbiota dysbiosis has been implicated as a key factor contributing to endotoxin translocation and chronic liver inflammation. Recent studies have highlighted the therapeutic potential of bovine colostrum-derived extracellular vesicles (BCEVs) in modulating gut microbiota and enhancing gut barrier function, but their effects on NASH remain largely unexplored. To investigate the potential protective effects of BCEVs against NASH, 8-wk-old mice were fed a NASH-inducing diet for 3 wks while concurrently receiving oral BCEV administration. BCEV treatment markedly ameliorated hepatic steatosis, fibrosis, and inflammation. Transcriptomic analyses demonstrated a notable reduction in lipid metabolism, bacterial response, and inflammatory pathways in the intestine, as well as reduced expression of inflammation- and fibrosis-related pathways in the liver. Gut microbiota profiling revealed an increased abundance of Akkermansia, accompanied by enhanced cholesterol excretion. Furthermore, BCEV treatment promoted the production of tight junction proteins and mucin in the gut, reinforcing intestinal barrier integrity. These findings suggest that BCEVs promote the proliferation of Akkermansia, which in turn prevents endotoxin translocation to the liver. This reduction in endotoxin leakage alleviates hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Overall, this study highlights the therapeutic potential of BCEVs as a novel strategy for managing NASH by targeting the gut-liver axis through the modulation of gut microbiota and barrier function."

      "abstract": "Sows and piglets face heightened oxidative stress during gestation and lactation, yet strategies to simultaneously mitigate these challenges remain underexplored. This study investigated the effects of β-carotene and superoxide dismutase (SOD) supplementation on 140 Landrace × Yorkshire sows (parity 3-5) randomly assigned to (1) a control; (2) long-term low-dose treatment (25 mg/kg β-carotene, 4 mg/kg SOD, or both) throughout gestation-lactation; or (3) short-term high-dose treatment (100 mg/kg β-carotene, 14 mg/kg SOD, or both) administered 7 days pre/post-weaning and farrowing. Our data indicate that the antioxidants enhanced the productive performance of both sows and piglets, with the most pronounced effect observed in the long-term, low-dose combined administration of β-carotene and SOD. The composite antioxidants significantly improved the systemic antioxidant capacity in sows, while concurrently reducing the cortisol and lipopolysaccharide concentrations in the serum. This enhancement contributed to elevations in serum progesterone and prolactin levels at day 40 of gestation and farrowing, respectively, ultimately increasing the number of weaned piglets and decreasing the backfat loss. In addition, the compound antioxidants improved the serum antioxidant indices of piglets, increased the growth hormone concentrations, and improved the litter weight gain. Mechanistically, the placental upregulation of CAT, GPX1, and GLUT3, alongside Claudin1, Occludin, and ZO-1 expression, underpinned improved nutrient transport and barrier function. These findings demonstrate that β-carotene and SOD synergistically transfer antioxidant capacity via placental and colostrum pathways, offering a viable strategy for integrated sow-piglet management."

      "abstract": "Colostrum quality is influenced by multiple factors, including its microbial load, which is determined by the cleanliness of collection and storage conditions. Additionally, the dam's diet and immune status play a crucial role in shaping colostrum quality by affecting immunoglobulin (IgG) concentrations. While many factors contribute to colostrum quality, this study will specifically use IgG content as the primary measure of quality. It is well established that feeding low-quality colostrum negatively affects calf health and growth, while feeding good-quality colostrum leads to better outcomes. However, it remains unclear if feeding colostrum above the recommended quality threshold offers additional benefits for calf health and growth. This study compared the effects of adequate versus high-quality colostrum on dairy heifer calf growth, health, and the development of the fecal microbiome during the first 15 weeks of life. We also measured the levels of apparent efficacy of absorption of IgG in both groups. Colostrum quality was initially determined and measured before feeding using a Brix refractometer (only feeding a minimum of 21% Brix); 93 heifer calves were assigned to treatment based on this data. Subsequently, laboratory analyses were conducted using radial immunodiffusion assays to measure the exact IgG levels in the colostrum; 72 calves were selected for continuation in the experiment based on the highest (n = 36) and lowest (n = 36) IgG levels in the colostrum. For these 72 calves, laboratory analyses were conducted using radial immunodiffusion assays to measure the exact IgG levels in the colostrum at the point of feeding and in the calf serum at 24 h post-feeding. To ensure a fair comparison, the groups were balanced for calf birthweight, breed, and dam parity. Serum IgG at 24 h, weight, and health data were analyzed in SAS using linear mixed models and logistic regression. Alpha and β diversity were analyzed using R with ANOVA, PERMANOVA, and Benjamini-Hochberg p-value adjustments. Calves fed colostrum with a high IgG content (123.0 mg/ml IgG) exhibited higher rates of passive transfer compared with those fed adequate-quality colostrum (85.2 mg/ml IgG). Both groups had passive transfer rates > 23 mg/ml IgG. Health outcomes were similar between the 2 groups, and average daily gain during the pre-weaning period was comparable, with calves gaining an average of 0.62 kg per day. Measures of α and β diversity in the fecal microbiome showed similar development in both groups. Apparent absorption efficacy was lower in calves fed high-quality colostrum (24.9%) compared with those fed adequate-quality colostrum (29.3%). The findings of this study support current recommendations for colostrum quality and suggest that calves may have a limited capacity to absorb higher concentrations of IgG. While feeding higher-quality colostrum did not lead to significant improvements in growth, health, or microbiome diversity, it demonstrated that adequate-quality colostrum can be equally effective when combined with best practice management. Further research is needed to better understand the relationships between immunoglobulin absorption efficiency, calf health, microbiome development, and growth performance."

METHODOLOGY: The systematic review was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis guidelines 2020. Full-text articles such as randomized control trials, cohort prospective studies, and pilot studies were identified from the following databases: PubMed, Web of Science, ProQuest, Clinicaltrial.gov, and Cochrane. After assessing for inclusion and exclusion criteria, eight studies were finally included and assessed for quality using the Effective Public Health Practice Project scale. RESULTS: Some studies reported a positive impact of BC on the duration and frequency of diarrheal infection in children, but the overall clinical benefits of BC in the gut health of children remain inconclusive. The studies were heterogeneous with regard to methodology, dose, form of BC used, and outcomes studied; hence, a meta-analysis could not be performed in terms of outcomes assessed. CONCLUSION: No conclusion can be drawn regarding the clinical benefits of BC in the gut health of children. Further studies are needed in the pediatric population using BC as an intervention for a variety of gastro-intestinal problems."

      "abstract": "Casein presence in colostrum may affect the absorption of immunoglobulins in neonate dairy calves. This randomized controlled trial investigated the effect of casein presence in colostrum replacer on serum IgG dynamics on calves. Seventy-one calves (BW: 45.3 ± 5.9 kg) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 colostrum treatments: colostrum replacer with casein addition to match the maternal colostrum (CR+C; n = 23; 85 g/L of IgG; Premolac Plus, Zinpro; 95 g/L of casein); colostrum replacer without casein addition (CR-C; n = 23; 85 g/L of IgG; Premolac Plus, Zinpro); and maternal colostrum (MC; n = 25; 85 g/L of IgG). Dystocia scores were recorded, and 3 h after birth, calves received 3.7 L of solution via tube feeding. Blood samples and calf vigor assessments were conducted at colostrum feeding (0 h) and 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h after colostrum feeding. Serum was analyzed for IgG concentration (g/L) and serum total protein (g/dL; STP). In addition, apparent efficiency of absorption of IgG (%; AEA), maximum IgG concentration (g/L; Cmax), time to maximum IgG concentration (h; Tmax), IgG area under the curve (g/L × h; AUC), and the apparent IgG persistency (%; AIP) were calculated. An ordinal logistic model was used to evaluate the odds of treatment improving a calf's vigor category from colostrum feeding (3 h of age) to 72 h after colostrum feeding. Vigor score was categorized as abnormal (≤4), average (5), or alert (≥6), with hour as a fixed effect. Mixed linear models were used to evaluate the effect of colostrum treatments on serum IgG, STP, AEA, Cmax, Tmax, AIP, and AUC, with time, dystocia score, calf sex, BW, and a treatment by time interaction as fixed effects. Calf vigor scores were not influenced by colostrum treatments. Treatment and time interaction affected serum IgG and STP levels after colostrum feeding. Serum IgG was lower for CR with casein addition (CR+C- compared with CR-C-treated calves) from 6 to 72 h. No difference was observed for serum IgG between CR+C- and MC-treated calves, regardless of time. Additionally, treatment affected AEA, with CR+C-treated calves exhibiting reduced AEA compared with CR-C calves (CR-C = 36.7 ± 2.0%, CR+C = 27.4 ± 2.1%, MC = 31.3 ± 2.1%). Treatment affected the Cmax, with CR+C-treated calves exhibiting reduced Cmax compared with CR-C and MC calves (CR-C = 29.5 ± 1.3 g/L, CR+C = 21.1 ± 1.3 g/L, MC = 26.2 ± 1.4 g/L). No differences were observed between treatments for Tmax and AIP. The AUC was lower for CR+C- compared with CR-C- and MC-treated calves (CR-C = 2,641.2 ± 117.5 g/L × h, CR+C = 1,719.3 ± 120.6 g/L × h, MC = 2,197.5 ± 124.4 g/L × h). For STP, no differences were observed between CR+C- and CR-C-treated calves (from 6 to 72 h). However, calves fed CR+C and CR-C displayed lower STP levels compared with MC-treated calves (from 12 to 24 h). These findings suggest that casein presence in colostrum replacer influences calf serum IgG concentration, STP levels, and AEA in neonatal calves."

This study investigates the effects of E. gracilis supplementation during late gestation and lactation on sow colostrum and milk biomolecular profiles. Sixty-one crossbred sows (Landrace × Yorkshire) were assigned to a standard diet (CON; n = 30) or the CON diet supplemented with 1 g/sow/day of E. gracilis (TRT; n = 31) from day 85 of gestation until day 21 of lactation. Sow performance, including litter size and weight, was recorded from birth to day 21 of age. Colostrum samples (n = 20; 10 sows/group) were collected within 1 h of farrowing, and milk samples were collected from the same sows on days 3 and 10 of lactation to assess alterations in non-volatile polar metabolites (NVM), fatty acids (FA), and associated metabolic pathways. On average, the litter size at birth was 14.2 ± 2.5 piglets/litter, with no effect of dietary treatment from birth to day 21 of lactation (P > 0.05). However, piglets suckled by TRT sows tended to have higher average daily gain from birth to day 21 of age than those suckled CON sows (191.0 ± 6.7 vs. 173.6 ± 6.8 g/day, P = 0.073). Chemometric analysis revealed distinct NVM and FA profiles between the groups, particularly in the colostrum. Although E. gracilis supplementation influenced the contents of multiple metabolites, focus has been given to those that have direct impact on piglet development, including increased colostrum leucine (P = 0.001), threonine (P < 0.001), and N-acetylglucosamine (P = 0.002), enhancing colostrum quality and immunomodulatory potential. Elevated colostrum gamma-linolenic acid (P = 0.047) and arachidonic acid (P = 0.019) levels suggested enhanced immune development. Pathways associated with amino sugars and nucleotide sugars and glucose-related metabolism in colostrum were also modulated. These findings suggest E. gracilis-derived β-glucan as a potential dietary supplement for enhancing sow colostrum quality and piglet growth."

Our objective was to assess the effect of OCC on the risk of LOS and mortality in VLBW premature neonates.MethodsA single-center randomized clinical trial was conducted on 65 VLBW preterm neonates. The intervention was oral care administrated every 6 hours, starting in the first 24 hours of life and lasting for 5 days, using either own mother's colostrum (colostrum group) or sterile water (placebo group).ResultsNeonates in the colostrum group were significantly less likely to have LOS (62.5% vs 93.9%, RR = 0.66, p = 0.002), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) (21.9% vs 48.5%, RR = 0.45, p = 0.025), feeding intolerance (56.3% vs 84.3%, RR = 0.66, p = 0.01), and mortality (18.8% vs 57.6%, RR = 0.3, p = 0.001). The time to start enteral nutrition in the colostrum group was shorter (p = 0.04) than in the placebo group. In multivariate analysis, OCC decreased the risk of LOS (OR = 0.12, p = 0.01) and death (OR = 0.14, p = 0.004). Moreover, OCC practice was associated with a faster time to regain birth weight (p = 0.027) and a shorter duration of hospitalization (p = 0.04) in surviving preterm infants.ConclusionOCC is a simple and safe practice that may yield a significant impact in reducing the risk of LOS, VAP, feeding intolerance, and mortality; can shorten time to start enteral feeding with faster regain to birth weight; and can shorten the length of hospital stay in VLBW preterm infants.",

METHODS: A computer-based search was conducted in databases including China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, Weipu Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Service System, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL for randomized controlled trials regarding the application of COIT in VLBW infants published from the establishment of the database to February 2024. Meta analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. RESULTS: A total of 14 randomized controlled trials were included, involving 1 386 VLBW infants, with 690 in the COIT group and 696 in the control group. The results showed that COIT significantly reduced the incidence of clinical late-onset sepsis (LOS) (RR=0.75, 95%CI: 0.64-0.88, P<0.001), the incidence of blood culture-proven LOS (RR=0.72, 95%CI: 0.57-0.92, P=0.008), mortality rate (RR=0.70, 95%CI: 0.52-0.95, P=0.020), the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (RR=0.65, 95%CI: 0.46-0.92, P=0.020), and the incidence of feeding intolerance (RR=0.49, 95%CI: 0.29-0.80, P=0.004). It also shortened the time to achieve full enteral nutrition (MD=-2.13, 95%CI: -4.03 to -0.23, P=0.030).

      "abstract": "Enriching low- or moderate-quality maternal colostrum (MC) by directly adding dry commercial colostrum replacement (CR) powder into MC is convenient, but it is unknown whether this may increase osmolality of the CR-MC mixture to levels that could potentially interfere with gut motility and calf health. Conversely, first reconstituting CR in water before mixing into MC should not increase osmolality but will result in a greater final volume to deliver to the calf. Our major objective was to describe the effect of either mixing dry unreconstituted CR powder directly into moderate-quality MC, or first reconstituting CR with water before mixing into moderate-quality MC, compared with feeding unenriched moderate- or high-quality MC, on calf serum IgG levels at 24 h. Secondary objectives were to investigate the effect of colostrum treatments on calf behavior during and shortly after colostrum feeding, and on appetite, health, and growth during the 3 d following birth. The study was conducted on a large commercial dairy in Minnesota. Each day, study technicians used a Brix refractometer to create 1 batch of moderate-quality MC (MC60; target ≈60 g/L IgG) and 1 batch of high-quality MC (MC90; target ≈90 g/L IgG). Following heat-treatment, MC60 and MC90 colostrum were frozen in 3-L or 3.8-L aliquots, intended to feed small and large calves, respectively. Eligible newborn calves were randomized to 1 of 4 colostrum treatments (33/group) delivered by esophageal tube feeder within 2 h of birth: moderate-quality MC (MC60), high-quality MC (MC90), dry CR powder mixed directly into moderate-quality MC (CR-MC60), or CR reconstituted in water before mixing into moderate-quality MC (CR-H2O-MC60). Total IgG dose fed was adjusted for small and large calves, respectively, with the goal being for the 2 CR-enriched groups to match the total IgG dose delivered to the MC90 group. Calf behavior was recorded via video during colostrum feeding and for 1 h following colostrum delivery in a subset of calves. Blood was collected from all calves at 24 h to measure serum IgG (g/L). Appetite and health scores were recorded daily for 3 d following enrollment, and calves were reweighed on d 3. Ranked from lowest to highest, mean serum IgG levels were 34.2 ± 1.2, 36.5 ± 1.2, 38.1 ± 1.1, and 40.4 ± 1.2 g/L in the MC60, CR-H2O-MC60, CR-MC60, and MC90 groups, respectively, with levels in both the MC90 and CR-MC60 groups statistically exceeding those in the MC60 group, and levels in the MC90 group statistically exceeding those in the CR-H2O-MC60 group. Neither approach to enriching moderate-quality MC negatively affected calf behavior, appetite, health, or growth in the first 3 d following enrollment. Results suggest that the commercial CR product studied may be safely added directly (dry) into moderate-quality MC to improve calf serum IgG levels. Caution should be used before generalizing study findings to other commercial CR products.",

      "abstract": "Adipokines related to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are an emerging area of interest. The aim of this study was to evaluate the associations between GDM and adipokine levels in human milk. This was an observational cohort study targeting mothers with gestational diabetes, which evaluated the association of maternal hyperglycemia severity, classified as GDM-G1 (diet treatment) and GDM-G2 (insulin treatment), with colostral adipokines involved in pro- and anti-inflammatory processes. Colostrum was collected from hyperglycemic (N = 34) and normoglycemic (N = 26) mothers, and adipokine levels were determined by immunoenzymatic assay. Among anti-inflammatory adipokines, only for irisin and vaspin, but not for obestatin and adropin, were significantly different levels noted between the GDM-G1, GDM-G2 and non-GDM cohorts. Colostrum of the GDM-G2 subgroup contained more vaspin (4.77 ng/mL) than that of normoglycemic mothers (3.12 ng/mL) and more irisin (26.95 μg/mL) than in the GDM-G1 subgroup (17.59 μg/mL). The levels of pro-inflammatory adipokines, namely, dermcidin, chemerin and visfatin, were at similar levels irrespective of maternal glycemia. Moreover, irisin showed a negative correlation with dermcidin in GDM-G2 and non-GDM cohorts. Associations were observed between colostral irisin and maternal preconception BMI, dermcidin and gestational age, and vaspin and maternal age. This study provides evidence that the way of restoring glucose homeostasis in pregnant women has an impact on the anti-inflammatory adipokines irisin and vaspin, but not on obestatin and adropin. GDM, regardless of severity, did not influence the colostral pro-inflammatory adipokines visfatin, chemerin and dermcidin.",

Angus-based heifers (n = 31, Exp. 1; n = 14, Exp. 2) were fed a basal diet (CON) or were fed a basal diet plus a vitamin and mineral supplement (VTM) from breeding (Exp. 1) or 60 d pre-breeding (Exp. 2) through calving. Colostrum was collected at calving, and serum was collected from calves 24 h after colostrum consumption to evaluate passive transfer. Serum was collected from calves in Exp. 1 to determine serum titers in response to vaccination at birth, pasture turn out, weaning, and 14 d after vaccination. Concentrations of IgG, IgM, or IgA in colostrum or in calf serum at 24 h were not impacted by dam treatment (p ≥ 0.21); however, concentrations of Ig in calf serum at 24 h were greater (p ≤ 0.01) in calves receiving maternal colostrum than those receiving a colostrum replacer. Calves born to VTM heifers had greater antibody titers at birth, pasture turn out, and weaning for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), bovine viral diarrhea virus type 2 (BVD-2), and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), respectively. Our results suggest that the programming of immune function in calves via prenatal nutrition appears to extend postnatally in CON and VTM offspring."

      "abstract": "The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the transference of passive immunity (TPI) and growth achieved by calves born to dams with low or high SCC at dry-off and fed with colostrum from cows with low or high SCC at dry-off. Forty multiparous (3.2 lactations; SD = 1.1), dry, and pregnant Holstein cows were used. The cows were separated into 2 groups based on the SCC in the last 3 monthly records before dry-off. An SCC of 200,000 cells/mL was used as the cut-off point to categorize cows with or without mastitis at dry-off, and 2 groups of 20 cows each were formed: L-cow cows (last 3 SCC before dry-off less than 200,000 cells/mL) and H-cow cows (last 3 SCC before dry-off greater than 200,000 cells/mL). At calving, 40 calves were obtained (20 calves born to L-cow cows [L-calf], and 20 calves born to H-cow cows [H-calf]; females = 21 and males = 19), and 40 colostrum units (20 from L-cow cows [L-col]; and 20 from H-cow cows [H-col]). The experimental design was a 2 × 2 factorial, with 2 factors and 2 levels within each factor (type of calf: L-calf and H-calf, and type of colostrum: L-col and H-col), determining 4 treatments (n = 10 per treatment): L-calfxL-col (L-calf fed with L-col); L-calfxH-col (L-calf fed with H-col); H-calfxL-col (H-calf fed with L-col); and H-calfxH-col (H-calf fed with H-col). Male and female calves were homogeneously distributed within each treatment. All calves received 4 L of colostrum, L-col or H-col depending on the assigned treatment, with an oro-esophageal tube within 3 h after birth. Yield, chemical composition and IgG were determined. The TPI and the apparent efficiency of IgG absorption (AEA) were also determined. Nutrient intake and body growth and development traits of the calves (BW, heart girth, and withers height) were determined in the first 30 d of life. The colostrum produced by L-cow presented a lower SCC compared with H-cow. Colostrum protein yield of L-cow was 0.21 kg higher than H-cow, and colostrum of L-cow had 24% higher IgG concentration. The TPI was not affected by the interaction calf type × colostrum type, and there was no effect of the colostrum type on the level TPI and AEA achieved by calves. However, an effect of calf type on TPI and AEA achieved was observed, as L-calf achieved greater TPI than H-calf (28.8 and 22.8 g IgG/L, respectively; SEM = 1.5), and L-calf presented a higher AEA than H-calf (30.0% and 24.5%, respectively; SEM = 1.4). The BW, heart girth, and withers height were not affected by calf type, colostrum type, or by the interaction calf type × colostrum type. We concluded that cows with high SCC at dry-off produced colostrum with higher SCC and lower IgG concentrations, but when ingested by calves it did not affect TPI, feed intake, growth, or development. Calves born to cows with high SCC at dry-off presented a lower AEA of IgG, which translated into a lower serum concentration of IgG, irrespective of type of colostrum that was fed.",

      "abstract": "The microbiome plays a crucial role in the calves' early stages of life. Several management practices can be considered to enhance the development and composition of the microbiome in calves. However, their social acceptance is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the public acceptance of innovative microbiome management practices aimed at improving the health and welfare of calves and to assess the factors influencing these levels of acceptance. Data used in the analysis were obtained from an online survey conducted in July 2023. The final sample consists of 3 220 citizens from four EU countries (Finland = 813, France = 803, Ireland = 801 and Poland = 803). Participants were asked to assess four management practices designed to improve calves' health and welfare: (1) using colostrum, (2) providing mix probiotics powder, (3) providing probiotics as yogurt or kefir and (4) prolonged cow-calf contact. Participants were provided with different levels of information: one group received only a short description of the intervention, while the other group received both the intervention description and information on aspects such as potential costs and environmental impact of the intervention. Participants were asked to rate the acceptance on a standardised scale ranging from 1 to 5, with 1 indicating \"strongly agree\" and 5 indicating \"strongly disagree\". Additionally, the participants were questioned about their socio-demographic background (e.g. age, education). They were also asked to provide their perspectives on various dimensions concerning familiarity with farming and microbiome, food safety, environmental awareness, cost consideration, and cultural perspective of consuming dairy products. Obtained data were analysed using the ordinary least squares regression model. The findings reveal that prolonged cow-calf contact was the most acceptable measure among tested interventions in all countries (79% of responders agreed or strongly agreed). Attitudinal and socio-economic variables were found to have a differential effect across the studied management strategies. For instance, individuals with greater familiarity with farming systems and microbiomes were more inclined to accept all four interventions, while women, compared to men, showed higher acceptance of prolonged cow-calf contact. Results also indicate that the provision of additional information to the participants was associated with a decrease in the acceptance of the measures. In conclusion, the public's perceptions regarding microbiome management strategies in dairy calves are shaped by complex factors. Also, our discussion emphasises the importance of clarity and transparency of messages, ethical dissemination of scientific knowledge, and the necessity for balanced and coherent communication.",

The primary purpose of this study was to investigate whether modified ultra-filtrated colostrum (UC) and hydrolyzed whey (W) products or their combinations with other natural products with reported immunomodulatory properties will stimulate NK cell cytotoxic activity by activation of granzyme B and IFN-γ production. METHODS: The ability of study products to stimulate the cytotoxic activity of human-purified CD56+ NK cells and the production of granzyme B and IFN-γ by activated NK cells was evaluated in the cytotoxic assay. RESULTS: All study products significantly increased NK-cell cytotoxic activity at an E: T ratio of 20:1. Treatment of cells with UC had a maximal cytotoxic effect at the minimal dose of 10 µg/ml, which exceeded the cytotoxic activity of IL-2. In contrast, the addition of egg yolk (CE) or CE + botanical blend (CEB) to UC resulted in a dose-dependent cytotoxic response with a maximal response at 1000 µg/ml. The maximal activity of blend products was comparable to UC activity. W exerted minimal stimulatory activity on NK cells. The magnitude of granzyme B and IFN-γ production was closely associated with the cytotoxic activity of NK cells stimulated with the study products. CONCLUSIONS: All study products demonstrated stimulatory activity on NK cells, with UC having a maximal effect on NK cell cytotoxicity. The study products can be used as dietary supplements to support NK cell activity in healthy individuals."

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of photoperiod during the dry period on subsequent colostrum and milk production in Holstein and Jersey cattle. Holstein and Jersey cows (n = 33) were dried off 60 d before their due date and randomly assigned to SDPP (Holstein, n = 9; Jersey, n = 8) or LDPP (Holstein, n = 8; Jersey, n = 8) until calving. Cows were weighed at the time of enrollment (d 0) and were housed in an enclosed barn at 20°C and exposed to 250 to 450 lx during periods of light and <10 lx during periods of darkness. At calving, colostrum volume was weighed and tested for relative protein concentration with a Brix refractometer and a sample was collected for component analysis (fat, protein, lactose, SNF) via infrared spectroscopy, as well as IgA, IgG, IgG1, IgM, lactoferrin, and SCS analysis. After calving, cows were returned to the freestall barn and exposed to ambient photoperiod and temperature. Milk production data were collected for 15 wk postcalving. Data were analyzed using PROC MIXED in SAS (SAS 9.4; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) with treatment, breed, and d 0 weight as fixed effects. PROC MIXED with repeated measures was used to evaluate the relationship of day length and breed with mature milk volume, fat, and protein production. Random effects included replicate, lactation number, genetic inbreeding percentage, previous lactation mature equivalent 305-d protein production, and calf sex. For colostrum, Brix score, colostral protein, fat, IgA, and IgM were increased in Jersey cows compared with Holstein cows. Total colostrum weight, SNF, lactose, lactoferrin, IgG, IgG1, and SCS did not differ by breed or treatment. Postcalving, ECM production was increased in Holstein cows compared with Jersey cows but unaffected by photoperiod treatment. Conversely, milk protein percentage was increased for Jersey cows relative to Holstein cows but was unaffected by photoperiod treatment. Milk fat increased in LDPP Holstein cows compared with SDPP Jersey cows during the first week of lactation, which is likely due to the transition from colostrum to mature milk production. Overall, photoperiod did not affect colostrum production, but differences by breed were detected. Photoperiod during the dry period did not affect mature milk production or protein, but milk fat percentage was affected by photoperiod × breed. Therefore, altered lighting during the dry period does not unfavorably affect colostrum or milk production in Jersey or Holstein cows.",

Two natural-based products of interest are chicken egg and bovine colostrum (the milk produced in the first few days following calving). Both products are rich in immunoglobulins, antimicrobial peptides, growth factors, and macro- and micro-nutrients. In vitro, in vivo, and a limited number of clinical studies suggest therapeutic benefits of both components given alone and together. Combination therapy is of particular interest, as preclinical studies suggest synergistic effects on growth, repair, and gut protection, including microbiome-induced damage. This article describes the main constituents of egg and bovine colostrum, studies of their use alone and together for a wide range of conditions, highlights areas requiring further research, and describes novel indications such as GLP-1-associated gut symptoms.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The oropharyngeal administration of colostrum (OAC) in neonates has several benefits. PURPOSE: To investigate the short-term outcomes of OAC in preterm neonates. METHODS: We performed this 2-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial at a tertiary neonatal center in Iran in 2021-2023. The intervention and control arms received 0.2 mL of their mother's colostrum or distilled water via oropharyngeal administration every 6 hours for 3 days starting from birth until 72 hours of age. The main study outcomes were neonatal death, the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), length of hospital stay, and period to full enteral feeding. A regression analysis was used to adjust for possible confounders. RESULTS: A total of 126 neonates (mean gestational age, 30.05 weeks) were randomized to the intervention and placebo groups (n=63 each) and had a mean±standard deviation weight of 1,247±193 g versus 1,156±215 g (P=0.013) and 1- and 5-min Apgar scores of 6.35 versus 5.38 (P=0.003) and 7.84 versus 7.13 (P=0.001), respectively. The mortality rate was 12.7% in the intervention group versus 14.3% in the placebo group (P=0.794). The necrotizing enterocolitis rate was significantly lower in the intervention versus placebo arm (11.1% vs. 28.6%, respectively, P=0.010), as was the clinically suspected sepsis rate (15.9% vs. 39.7%, respectively, P=0.004). The ROP and bronchopulmonary dysplasia rates did not differ significantly between groups after the adjustment for confounders. The mean length of hospital stay was shorter in the intervention group (26.1 days vs. 37.32 days, P=0.023). Moreover, the mean duration of antibiotic therapy and period to full feeding were significantly shorter in the intervention group. CONCLUSION: OAC could effectively decrease the incidence of complications in preterm infants and facilitate earlier patient discharge."

Cells were treated with BCFM in the presence or absence of alpha-MSH and co-cultured for 24, 48, and 72 h. The treatment of B16F1 cells with alpha-MSH resulted in the darkening of the color of the cells and induction of melanin synthesis. In addition, the expression levels of MC1R and cAMP, as well as phosphorylation levels of CREB and PKA, were increased by alpha-MSH treatment. However, concomitant treatment with BCFM resulted in a significant decrease in these factors and phosphorylated MITF. At the same time, the expressive amount of TRP-1 and tyrosinase was also decreased in B16F1 cells. These results demonstrate the potential of BCFM for the prevention of melanogenesis progression via the regulation of the MC1R-cAMP signaling pathway in alpha-MSH-induced B16F1 cells. The administration of BCFM suppressed the expression of TRP-1 and/or tyrosinase by regulating the CREB/MITF signaling pathways in the B16F1 cells. We propose that hydrolyzed cow colostrum extract (BCFM) is suitable for use as a novel active agent for skin whitening or pharmaceutical applications."

      "abstract": "Bovine mastitis is an infectious disease that causes substantial economic losses to the dairy industry worldwide. Current antibiotic therapy faces issues of antibiotic misuse and antimicrobial resistance, which has aroused concerns for both veterinary and human medicine. Thus, this study explored the potential of Colo EVs (bovine colostrum-derived extracellular vesicles) to address mastitis. Using LPS-induced murine mammary epithelial cells (HC11), mouse monocyte macrophages (RAW 264.7), and a murine mastitis model with BALB/C mice, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of Colo EVs, in vivo and in vitro. Colo EVs had favorable biosafety profiles, promoting cell proliferation and migration without inducing pathological changes after injection into murine mammary glands. In LPS-induced murine mastitis, Colo EVs significantly reduced inflammation, improved inflammatory scores, and preserved tight junction proteins while protecting milk production. Additionally, in vitro experiments demonstrated that Colo EVs downregulated inflammatory cytokine expression, reduced inflammatory markers, and attenuated NF-κB pathway activation. In summary, we inferred that Colo EVs have promise as a therapeutic approach for mastitis treatment, owing to their anti-inflammatory properties, potentially mediated through the NF-κB signaling pathway modulation.",

      "abstract": "Minerals are supplemented routinely to dairy cows during the dry period to prevent metabolic issues postpartum. However, limited information exists on the impacts of mineral supplementation on colostrum carotenoids. This study aimed to determine the effects of prepartum supplementation with three micro-nutrients; inorganic selenium (INORG), organic selenium (ORG) or rumen-protected choline (RPC) on the carotenoid content of bovine colostrum and transition milk (TM) from pasture-based dairy cows. A total of 57 (12 primiparous and 45 multiparous) Holstein-Friesian (HF) and HF × Jersey (JEX) cows were supplemented daily for 49 ± 12.9 d before calving. Colostrum samples were collected from all cows immediately postpartum and TM one to five (TM1-TM5) were collected from a sub-set of 15 cows (five per treatment group) at each consecutive milking postpartum. Carotenoid concentration was determined using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography - diode array detection (UHPLC-DAD). With the use of transmittance, the colour index and colour parameters a*, b* and L* were used to determine colour variations over this period. Prepartum supplementation did not have a significant effect on colostrum β-carotene concentration or colour. Positive correlations between β-carotene and colour parameter b* (R2 = 0.671; P < 0.001) and β-carotene and colour index (R2 = 0.560; P < 0.001) were observed. Concentrations of β-carotene were highest in colostrum (1.34 μg/g) and decreased significantly with each milking postpartum (TM5 0.31 μg/g). Breed had a significant effect on colostrum colour with JEX animals producing a greater b* colostrum than HF animals (P = 0.030). Primiparous animals produced colostrum with the weakest colour compared to second or ≥third parity animals (P = 0.042). Despite statistical increases in the b* parameter in colostrum from JEX cows and multiparous cows, β-carotene concentrations did not significantly increase suggesting that other factors may influence colostrum colour. The b* parameter may be used as an indicator for estimating carotenoid concentrations in colostrum and TM, particularly when assessed via transmittance spectroscopy."

METHOD: Approximately 2 L of first milking colostrum was collected from 10 farms in the Waikato region. Following mixing, it was split into five 400-mL sub-samples and allocated randomly to a control (two sub-samples), or treatment with yoghurt, potassium sorbate, or citric acid preservative. Throughout the trial samples remained in the laboratory at ambient temperature with the lids slightly ajar, and were stirred daily for 15-30 seconds using a sterile spatula. Sub-samples were tested on Days 0, 7 and 14. On Days 0 and 14 aerobic bacteria (by aerobic plate count (APC)), Lactobacillus spp., coliforms and Streptococcus thermophilus counts, pH, Brix percentage, protein, fat and anhydrous lactose were measured. On Day 7 only bacterial counts were completed.The data were analysed using non-parametric clustered bootstrap sampling to estimate the effect of treatment, time, and their interaction on the outcome variables. RESULTS: Compared to control samples, on Day 7 the APC for potassium sorbate (1.0 (90% CI = 0.6-1.6) × 108 cfu/mL) was approximately seven-fold lower than for yoghurt (7.3 (90% CI = 4.1-11) × 108 cfu/mL), and approximately three-fold lower than citric acid (3.2 (90% CI = 0.2-4.3) × 108 cfu/mL) remaining low to Day 14. All preservatives reduced coliform growth compared to control samples at Day 7 but growth was lower for potassium sorbate than the other preservatives. For Lactobacillus spp., at Day 7, samples with yoghurt preservative had greater counts than the other two preservatives. Potassium sorbate reduced growth of S. thermophilus compared to the other treatments, especially at Day 7, with 7-10 times fewer S. thermophilus per mL compared to the other three groups. All groups showed an obvious acidification over time, with very little variation within days and treatment groups. There was no evidence for change in fat or protein percentage over time regardless of treatment. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Aerobic and coliform bacteria proliferate extensively in unpreserved colostrum. All preservatives decreased coliform counts compared to un-preserved colostrum, but potassium sorbate was more effective at decreasing both coliforms and aerobic bacteria than either yoghurt or citric acid.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of dietary energy levels during late gestation on mineral content in the plasma, colostrum, and milk of jennies postpartum. Twenty-four pregnant multiparous DeZhou jennies, aged 6.0  ±  0.1 years, with a body weight of 292  ±  33 kg, an average parity number of 2.7  ±  0.1, and similar expected dates of confinement (74  ±  4 days), were randomly allocated to three groups and fed three diets: high energy (12.54 MJ/kg, HE), medium energy (12.03 MJ/kg, ME), and low energy (11.39 MJ/kg, LE). Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein of each jenny at time points of 0 h, 24 h, 48 h, 5 d, 7 d, and 14 d after parturition. Additionally, milk samples were collected through manual milking, and an analysis of the mineral content was conducted. The results showed that compared with HE, both ME and LE significantly increased the levels of calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), zinc (Zn), selenium (Se), molybdenum (Mo), and cobalt (Co) in the plasma and Ca, P, magnesium (Mg), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), Zn, selenium (Se), molybdenum (Mo), and Co in the milk of jennies postpartum (p < 0.05); ME also increased the levels of potassium (K), iron (Fe), and Mn in plasma and K and Fe in milk (p < 0.05). The levels of Ca, K, Mg, P, Fe, Cu, Mn, Co, Se, Zn, and Mo in plasma and milk gradually decreased with increasing postpartum time. Their contents were the highest at 0 h postpartum, rapidly decreased after 24 h postpartum, and declined to the lowest on day 14 postpartum. The interaction between dietary energy level and postpartum time showed that although the concentrations of the minerals Ca, P, K, Mg, Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn, Co, Se, and Mo decreased in jennies' plasma and milk in the treatment groups with different energy levels as postpartum time increased, the pattern of change was also influenced by dietary energy level. The influence of dietary energy level in late gestation on the mineral content of milk and plasma during the postpartum colostrum phase was higher than that during the milk phase. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that, under the current experimental conditions, the mineral content of the colostrum, milk, and plasma of jennies after parturition was dependent on the dietary energy level during late gestation."

      "abstract": "The prepartum diet as well as individual metabolic status of the cow influences colostrum parameters. The objectives of this study were to (1) investigate the effect of increasing prepartum dietary MP supply on colostrum yield, composition, and IgG concentration, and (2) identify prepartum metabolic indicators associated with these outcomes. Multiparous Holstein cows (n = 96) were blocked by expected calving date and randomly assigned to 1 of 2 prepartum diets formulated to contain a control (85 g of MP/kg of DM; 1,175 g of MP/d) or high (HI; 113 g of MP/kg DM; 1,603 g of MP/d) level of MP starting at 28 d before expected calving. Both prepartum diets were formulated to supply Met and Lys at an equal amount of 1.24 and 3.84 g/Mcal ME, respectively. Metabolic indicators were determined in serum (albumin, glutamate dehydrogenase, cholesterol, aspartate transaminase, total protein, total bilirubin, and IgG) or plasma (Ca, glucose, fatty acids, BHB, and urea nitrogen) twice weekly in a subset of cows (n = 60). Colostrum was harvested at 3.6 ± 2.4 h from calving and yield as well as concentrations of IgG, fat, protein, and Ca were determined. Cows were retrospectively grouped based on the typical volume of colostrum needed for 2 colostrum meals (<6 or ≥6 kg), IgG concentration (<100 or ≥100 g/L), as well as the median concentrations of fat (<4.4% or ≥4.4%), protein (<16.5% or ≥16.5%), Ca (<0.21% or ≥0.21%), and total colostrum ME (<8.65 or ≥8.65 Mcal). Data were analyzed using mixed effects ANOVA, with repeated measures where applicable. Feeding HI tended to increase colostrum yield in cows entering parity 2 (9.4 vs. 7.2 ± 0.9 kg), but treatment did not affect yield from cows entering parity ≥3 (5.1 vs. 6.4 ± 1.0 kg). Supply of MP did not affect concentrations of IgG, fat, protein, or Ca. Cows that produced ≥6 kg versus those producing <6 kg of colostrum had lower plasma concentrations of glucose. Metabolic indicators were not associated with IgG group. Colostrum fat ≥4.4% was associated with cows having lower prepartum concentrations of glucose, total protein, albumin, and aspartate transaminase activity. Colostrum protein ≥16.5% was associated with lower circulating serum IgG and elevated cholesterol. Elevated glucose as well as lower cholesterol and BHB concentrations were associated with colostrum Ca ≥0.21%. Further, higher albumin and fatty acids as well as lower glucose concentrations were associated with a greater colostrum energy output. In conclusion, increasing prepartum MP supply tended to increase colostrum yield in cows entering parity 2, but did not affect the composition or IgG concentration. The observed associations between metabolic indicators and colostrum parameters suggest that slight adjustment in metabolism during late gestation might be necessary to support colostrogenesis, but the causality of these relationships should be considered.",

The present study compared the composition and selected biological properties of colostrum from Polish sheep (colostrum 1) and Swiss sheep (colostrum 2), particularly those that can affect healthy or diseased skin. The antioxidant activity of the colostrums was measured using ABTS and DPPH assays. The effect on the proliferation of human skin fibroblasts, neonatal epidermal keratinocytes, and human diabetic fibroblast (dHF) cells isolated from diabetic foot ulcers was also assayed in vitro by MTT and Presto Blue tests, respectively. The colostrum simulated dHF cell proliferation by up to 115.4%. The highest used concentration of colostrum 1 stimulated normal fibroblast proliferation by 191.2% (24 h) and 222.2% (48 h). Both colostrums inhibited epidermal keratinocyte viability. The influence of the colostrums on the expression of genes related to proliferation (Ki67) and immune response (IL-6, PTGS-2, TSG-6) in dHF cells were compared. Colostrum 1 increased the rate of wound closure (scar test). Analysis of total fat, protein and fatty acid content found the Polish colostrum to be a richer source of fat than the Swiss colostrum, which contained a larger amount of protein. Both colostrums exhibit properties that suggest they could be effective components in cosmetic or medicinal formulations for skin care, especially supporting its regeneration, rejuvenation, and wound healing.",

      "abstract": "Recently, much interest has been raised for the characterization of signaling molecules carried by extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are particularly enriched in milk (mEVs). Such interest is linked to the capability of EVs to cross biological barriers, resist acidification in the gastric environment, and exert modulation of the immune system, mainly through their microRNA (miRNA) content. We characterized the small-RNA cargo of colostrum EVs (colosEVs) and mEVs from Italian Mediterranean buffalo through next generation sequencing. Colostrum (first milking after birth) and milk (day 50 of lactation) were sampled from seven subjects from five farms. ColosEVs and mEVs were subjected to morphological characterization, followed by high-depth sequencing of small RNA libraries produced from total RNA. The main difference was the amount of EV in the two samples, with colostrum showing 10 to 100-fold higher content than milk. For both matrices, miRNA was the most abundant RNA species (95% for colosEVs and 96% for mEVs) and three lists were identified: colosEV-specific, mEV-specific and shared most expressed. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on miRNA targets highlighted many terms related to the epigenetic, transcriptional and translational regulations across the three lists, with a higher number of enriched terms for colosEV-specific miRNAs. Terms specific to colosEVs were related to \"cell differentiation\" and \"microvillus assembly\", while for mEV \"cardiac and blood vessel development\" and \"mitochondria\" emergerd. Immune modulation terms were found for both sample-specific miRNAs. Overall, both matrices carry a similar molecular message in terms of biological processes potentially modulated into receiving cells, but there is significant difference in the abundance, with colostrum containing much more EVs than milk. Moreover, colosEVs carry molecules involved in signal transduction, cell cycle and immune response, as for mEVs and EVs of other previously characterized species, but with a special enrichment for miRNAs with epigenetic regulation capacities. These beneficial characteristics of colosEVs and mEVs are essential for the calf and could also be exploited for the therapeutic purposes in humans, although further studies are necessary to measure the sanitization treatment impact on EV conservation, especially in buffalo where milk is consumed almost exclusively after processing.",

      "abstract": "A newborn female, Holstein calf weighing approximately 38.5 kg developed severe, persistent colic caused by a large colostrum curd located within the calf's abomasum. Based upon 10% body weight, the calf had been fed 4 liters (L) of first-milking colostrum approximately 30 min after birth and an additional 2 L of first-milking colostrum 6 h after the first feeding. Both the first and second feedings used an esophageal tube feeder to deliver the colostrum. Colic developed shortly after the second colostrum feeding. The affected calf did not respond to on-farm supportive medical therapy and was humanely euthanized by a penetrating captive bolt approximately 22 h after the onset of colic. This on-farm colostrum feeding protocol is routinely observed in the current dairy industry. This case demonstrates calves that are fed large volumes of colostrum during a relatively short window of time may develop a large, firm colostrum curd within the abomasum that causes abdominal distension, colic, and occasional death. There is an urgent need for prospective analytical studies that determine the optimal immunoglobulin mass (g/L) and the ideal volume of colostrum fed to newborn calves for both the first and second colostrum feedings within the most beneficial time frame. Guidelines should be developed that minimize complications that adversely affect calf health and well-being while ensuring the successful transfer of passive immunity."

The hypothesis is that BOV-COL supplementation as an add-on treatment results in favorable alternations in selected blood inflammatory markers or neurotransmitters, leading to better depression treatment outcomes compared with placebo (PLA). METHODS: Patients with a Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 score ≥60 points were enrolled. Twenty-nine participants (n=18 in the BOV-COL group and n=11 in the PLA group) completed the protocol. RESULTS: The mean Beck Depression Inventory-II score was significantly reduced after supplementation in both groups. However, the mean 17-point Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score was decreased in the BOV-COL group, but not in the PLA group. In the BOV-COL group, there was a reduction in interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-10, the IL-6:IL-10 ratio, IL-17, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), while in the PLA group only IL-6 decreased. Favorable alternations in the total count and differentials of white blood cell subsets were more pronounced in the BOV-COL. There were no changes in neurotransmitter concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: BOV-COL supplementation is a promising add-on therapy in patients with depression and SUD."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) and hyocholic acids (HCA) during late gestation and lactation on reproductive performance, colostrum quality, antioxidant capacity and gut microbiota in multiparous sows. METHODS: A total of 60 healthy multiparous cross-bred sows (Landrace × Yorkshire) were randomly fed 4 groups diets as follows: the basal diets (CTRL group), or the basal diets containing only 600 mg/kg GOS (GOS group), 600 mg/kg GOS + 100 mg/kg HCA (GOS + Low HCA group), and 600 mg/kg + 200 mg/kg HCA (GOS + High HCA group) from d 85 of gestation to weaning. Multiple parameters of sows were determined. RESULTS: There was a trend of shortening the labor process of sows (p = 0.07) in the GOS group and GOS + Low/High HCA group. Compared with the CTRL group, the GOS + Low/High HCA group increased the average piglets weight at birth (p < 0.05), and increased the IgA concentration of colostrum (p < 0.05). In addition, serum triglyceride (TG) concentration was lower (p < 0.05), and serum total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) was higher (p < 0.05) in the GOS and GOS + Low/High HCA groups than in the CTRL group at farrowing. Serum catalase (CAT) activities was higher in the GOS and GOS + High HCA groups than in the CTRL group at farrowing. The 16S rRNA analysis showed that GOS combination with high-dose HCA shaped the composition of gut microbiota in different reproductive stages (d 107 of gestation, G107; d 0 of lactation, L0; d 7 of lactation, L7). At the phylum level, the relative abundance of Bacteroidota and Desulfobacterota in G107, Bacteroidota, and Proteobacteria in L0, and Planctomycetota in L7 was increased in GOS + High HCA group (p < 0.05). Spearman correlation analysis showed that Streptococcus was positively correlated with the serum TG but negatively correlated with the average piglets weight at birth (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This investigation demonstrated that the administration of galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) in conjunction with hyocholic acids (HCA), to sows with nutrient restrictions during late gestation and lactation, further improved their antioxidant capacity and milk quality. The observed beneficial effects of GOS + HCA supplementation could potentially be linked to an improvement in gut microbiota disorders of the sows."

      "abstract": "Assistance during calving and cesarean section (C-section) are important risk factors for the failure of transfer of passive immunity (FTPI) in beef calves, which increases the risk of morbidity and mortality in beef calves during the preweaning period. Colostrum replacement recommendations for beef calves, and especially for those delivered by C-section, are unavailable. The objective of this study was to determine whether or not colostrum replacement or supplementation with a commercially available product could increase serum IgG concentrations in beef calves delivered by elective C-section, compared to beef calves that nursed colostrum naturally. An elective C-section was performed in 32 pregnant beef cows and first-calf heifers. Immediately after delivery, newborn calves were randomly assigned to one of three different treatment groups. Group A calves (n = 7) were fed one packet of a commercial colostrum replacer (CR) product providing 60 g of IgG within 30 min of life. A second packet of the same CR was fed at 6 h of life. Group B calves (n = 13) were fed the same CR at the same frequency as group A; however, these calves were reunited with their dams after the second CR feeding to allow additional nursing of maternal colostrum. Group C calves (n = 12) were united with their dams immediately after surgery without colostrum intervention. Serum IgG levels at 48 h of life were greater in group C calves and in calves born to multiparous cows. Based on the results of this study, neither colostrum replacement nor supplementation result in higher serum IgG concentrations in beef calves delivered by elective C-section compared with natural nursing."

      "abstract": "Lactoferrin (Lf), a multifunctional cationic glycoprotein extracted from milk or colostrum, is able to chelate two ferric ions per molecule, inhibit the formation of reactive oxygen species, interact with the anionic components of bacteria or host cells, and enter inside host cell nucleus, thereby exerting antibacterial, anti-invasive, and anti-inflammatory activities. By virtue of Lf presence, bovine colostrum is expected to perform analogous functions to pure Lf, along with additional activities attributable to other bioactive constituents. The present research aims to compare the antibacterial, anti-invasive, and anti-inflammatory activities of bovine Lf purified from milk (mbLf) and colostrum (cbLf) in comparison to those exhibited by whole bovine colostrum (wbc). The results demonstrated a major efficacy of mbLf in inhibiting pathogenic bacteria and in exerting anti-invasive and anti-survival activities with respect to cbLf and wbc. Furthermore, mbLf lowered IL-6 levels to those of uninfected cells, while a less evident decrease was observed upon cbLf treatment. Conversely, wbc managed to slightly lower IL-6 levels compared to those synthesized by infected cells. These data demonstrate that, to obtain maximum effectiveness in such activities, Lf should be formulated/used without addition of other substances and should be sourced from bovine milk rather than colostrum.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: For very preterm infants, human milk is often fortified with formula products based on processed bovine milk. Intact bovine colostrum (BC), rich in anti-inflammatory milk factors, is considered an alternative. We investigated if BC affects anti-inflammatory/TH2 immunity and infection risk in very preterm infants. METHODS: For a secondary analysis of a multicenter, randomized controlled trial (NCT03537365), very preterm infants (26-31 weeks gestation, 23% small for gestational age, SGA) were randomized to receive BC (ColoDan, Biofiber, Denmark, n = 113) or conventional fortifier (PreNAN, Nestlé, Switzerland, n = 116). Infection was defined as antibiotic treatment for five or more consecutive days and 29 cytokines/chemokines were measured in plasma before and after start of fortification. RESULTS: In general, infection risk after start of fortification was associated with low gestational age, SGA status and antibiotics use prior to fortification. Adjusted for confounders, infants fortified with BC showed more infection episodes (20 vs 12%, P < 0.05) and higher cumulative infection risk (hazard ratio, HR 1.9, P = 0.06), particularly for SGA infants (HR 3.6, P < 0.05). Additionally, BC-fortified infants had higher levels of TH2-related cytokines/chemokines (IL-10, MDC, MCP4) and reduced levels of cytokines related to TH1/TH17-responses (IL-15, IL-17, GM-CSF). The differences were most pronounced in SGA infants, displaying higher levels of TH2-related IL-4, IL-6, and IL-13, and lower interferon-γ and IL-1α levels in the BC group. CONCLUSION: Infants fortified with BC displayed a delayed shift from TH2- to TH1-biased systemic immunity, notably in SGA infants, possibly influenced by multiple confounding factors, alongside elevated antibiotic use, suggesting increased susceptibility to infection.",

Twelve Japanese Black female cows were fed concentrate feed without (CON; n = 6) or with (BUTY; n = 6) sodium butyrate supplementation at 1.1% of dietary dry matter from -60 d relative to the expected parturition date to 4 d after parturition.

In addition, plasma GLP-1 concentration was higher for the BUTY than for the CON at 3 d after calving (P < 0.05). This study showed for the first time that GLP-1 is present in the colostrum of Japanese Black cows at higher concentrations as compared to in plasma (P < 0.01). On the other hand, no treatment effect was observed for concentrations of metabolite and hormone in colostrum and transition milk. In summary, feeding beef cows with sodium butyrate during the late gestation and early post-partum period likely increases plasma GLP-1 concentrations post-partum without affecting the components of colostrum and transition milk.",

The colostrum supplementation was the previously frozen colostrum added to the milk replacer from day 2-5 given to 39 calves, and 36 Control calves received a milk-derived supplement. There was no significant difference in preweaning weight gain between the treatment groups. Serum samples collected on days 2, 7, 14, and 21 indicated that total and antigen-specific IgG levels against rotavirus, coronavirus, and E. coli F5 were not significantly different between the treatment groups. Fecal samples taken on days 7, 14, and 21 were all negative for coronavirus and E. coli F5, whereas there were low levels of Cryptosporidia and a trend for low levels of rotavirus on day 14 in colostrum-supplemented compared to Control calves. Respiratory clinical signs, depressed attitude and body temperature tended to be reduced in colostrum-supplemented compared to Control calves. This study shows that, even in calves with good colostrum status and high plane of nutrition, there can be benefits of post-closure colostrum supplementation including reduced Cryptosporidia and rotavirus shedding and reduced respiratory disease."

For this experiment, 65 calves were enrolled and housed individually until 70 d of age. Calves were fed milk replacer (150 g/L) 3 times daily with 9, 10.5, 11.25, and 12 L/d offered from d 1 to 7, 8 to 14, 15 to 21, 22 to 56, respectively. Calves were weaned over 8 d from d 57 to 64, receiving a total of 7.8 L in 2 meals per day from d 57 to 60 and 3.8 L/d in 1 feeding from d 61 to 64. At d 57, calves were blocked by birth weight and randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatments, equal in ME, which were fed once daily during weaning from d 57 to 64: control (CON; n = 31 calves): 3.8 L of milk replacer (150 g/L) fed by nipple bottle, or colostrum supplementation (COL; n = 34): a mixture of 1 L of bovine colostrum replacer (125 g/L) and 3 L of milk replacer (150 g/L) with 3.8 L of of the mixture fed by nipple bottle. Serum IgG was measured within 48 h of birth and BW was taken at d 0, 57, 60, 64, 70, 77, and 84. Starter intake and bovine respiratory disease (BRD) score were measured daily from d 50 to 70, and fecal consistency was examined daily from d 56 to 70. Serum BHB and lung consolidation were evaluated at d 57, 64, and 70, and intestinal permeability was assessed by recovery of chromium-EDTA, lactulose, and d-mannitol from plasma after oral administration at d 56 and 65. Body weight had no difference between treatment groups at the start of weaning, but COL were 2.79 kg (95% CI: 0.90-4.68) and 2.76 kg (95% CI: 0.86-4.65) heavier than CON at d 77 and 84, respectively. Additionally, COL tended to gain 100.00 g/d more than CON calves (95% CI: -10.41-207.13) from d 57 to 84. No differences were observed in any of the other variables measured. Supplementation of bovine colostrum replacer during weaning may improve weight gain, but the mechanism of action is not clear.",

Recent studies have found that bovine milk exosomes can improve intestinal mucosal health by delivering microRNA (miRNA), but the mechanism of action is so far unknown. In the present study, we analyzed the differential expression profiles of miRNA in colostrum and mature milk exosomes using high-throughput sequencing, based on the demonstration that colostrum exosomes inhibit the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced intestinal epithelial NF-κB inflammatory pathway better than mature milk exosomes. The bta-miR-30a-5p, which is specifically highly expressed in colostrum, was screened, and its predicted target gene TRAM was found to be closely related to the NF-κB signaling pathway by functional enrichment analysis. Further, we used gene overexpression and silencing techniques and found that the bta-miR-30a-5p transfection treatment was confirmed to inhibit LPS-induced NF-κB signaling pathway activation and downstream pro-inflammatory factor expression, while the expression of its potential target gene, TRAM, was also suppressed. It is hypothesized that the high expression of bta-miR-30a-5p in colostrum, which targets TRAM to inhibit the downstream NF-κB inflammatory pathway, may be one of the molecular mechanisms responsible for its superior effect on resisting inflammatory attack compared to mature milk."

Colostrum-derived Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus Probio-M9 (Probio-M9) has shown a protective effect in a colitis-associated cancer (CAC) model, but detailed metagenomic analysis had not been performed. Here, we investigated the preventive effects of the probiotic Probio-M9 on CAC-model mice, tracking the microbiota. Feces were obtained at four time points for evaluation of gut microbiota. The effect of Probio-M9 on tight junction protein expression was evaluated in co-cultured Caco-2 cells. Probio-M9 treatment decreased the number of tumors as well as stool consistency score, spleen weight, inflammatory score, and macrophage expression in the CAC model. Probio-M9 accelerated the recovery of the structure, composition, and function of the intestinal microbiota destroyed by azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) by regulating key bacteria (including Lactobacillus murinus, Muribaculaceae bacterium DSM 103720, Muribaculum intestinale, and Lachnospiraceae bacterium A4) and pathways from immediately after administration until the end of the experiment. Probio-M9 co-culture protected against lipopolysaccharide-induced impairment of tight junctions in Caco-2 cells. This study provides valuable insight into the role of Probio-M9 in correcting gut microbiota defects associated with inflammatory bowel disease carcinogenesis and may have clinical application in the treatment of inflammatory carcinogenesis."

      "abstract": "This study investigated how dietary fiber supplementation during the transition period in sows affects constipation, farrowing duration, colostrum production, milk yield, and pre-weaning piglet mortality in the free-farrowing system. A total of 92 Landrace × Yorkshire sows and their 1272 offspring were included in the study. Sows were divided into two groups by parity: control (n = 41) and treatment (n = 51). The control group was fed a standard lactation diet 7 days before farrowing, whereas the treatment group received the same diet with 75 g/day of a dietary fiber supplement. The dietary fiber content analyses were 4.30% and 5.53% in the control and treatment groups, respectively. Sows were fed with 3.89 ± 0.92 kg per day with a diet containing 17.8% crude protein, 3732 kcal/kg of metabolizable energy, and 1.1% lysine. Parameters including farrowing duration, litter characteristics, and the fecal condition of sows were measured. Piglet mortality rates were recorded at 3, 7, and 21 days of lactation. Sows had an average farrowing duration of 216 ± 159 min, with litter sizes of 13.8 ± 4.2 piglets per litter, and a 7.4% stillbirth rate. The treatment group showed a lower constipation rate compared to the control group (17.6% vs. 46.3%, p = 0.003). Farrowing duration did not significantly differ between groups, but the treatment group experienced a 43.6 min shorter duration. In sows with litter sizes of ≥16 piglets per litter, the farrowing duration for sows in the treatment group tended to be shorter than that of the control groups (202.0 ± 37.9 vs. 287.5 ± 41.3 min, p = 0.115). The mean colostrum intake of piglets in the control and treatment groups averaged 424.0 ± 13.7 g and 421.8 ± 12.6 g, respectively (p = 0.908). Likewise, the milk production of sows from Days 3 to 10 and from Days 10 to 17 of lactation in the treatment group (7.34 ± 0.27 and 8.76 ± 0.43 kg/day, respectively) did not differ from that of the control group (7.85 ± 0.30 and 9.55 ± 0.47 kg/day, respectively, p > 0.05). Pre-weaning piglet mortality was slightly lower in the treatment group (13.4% vs. 17.3%, p = 0.085). Across groups, piglet mortality rates within 3, 7, and 21 days were 10.3%, 11.9%, and 15.4%, respectively. Piglets with a ≤200 g colostrum intake had a higher pre-weaning mortality compared to those with a higher intake (p < 0.05), except for the 201-300 g intake (p = 0.472). In conclusion, introducing dietary fiber to sows during the transition period reduced constipation and tended to decrease farrowing duration, especially in sows with large litters. Additionally, it lowered pre-weaning piglet mortality by 3.9% in the free-farrowing system. Nonetheless, providing sows with a 75 g/day dietary fiber supplement for only 7 days before farrowing was not enough to enhance colostrum and milk production, nor did it lead to an increase in piglet colostrum consumption."

      "abstract": "The growing number of antibiotic resistance genes is putting a strain on the ecosystem and harming human health. In addition, consumers have developed a cautious attitude towards chemical preservatives. Colostrum and milk are excellent sources of antibacterial components that help to strengthen the immunity of the offspring and accelerate the maturation of the immune system. It is possible to study these important defenses of milk and colostrum, such as lactoferrin, lysozyme, immunoglobulins, oligosaccharides, etc., as biotherapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of numerous infections caused by microbes. Each of these components has different mechanisms and interactions in various places. The compound's mechanisms of action determine where the antibacterial activity appears. The activation of the antibacterial activity of milk and colostrum compounds can start in the infant's mouth during lactation and continue in the gastrointestinal regions. These antibacterial properties possess potential for therapeutic uses. In order to discover new perspectives and methods for the treatment of bacterial infections, additional investigations of the mechanisms of action and potential complexes are required."

      "abstract": "Rabbits, pivotal in the EU as livestock, pets, and experimental animals, face bacterial infection challenges, prompting a quest for alternatives to curb antibiotic resistance. Bovine colostrum (BC), rich in immunoregulatory compounds, antimicrobial peptides, and growth factors, is explored for disease treatment and prevention. This study assesses BC diet supplementation effects on rabbit intestines, examining gene expression. Thirty female New Zealand White rabbits at weaning (35 days) were divided into three experimental groups: control (commercial feed), 2.5% BC, and 5% BC. The diets were administered until slaughtering (81 days). BC-upregulated genes in the jejunum included IL-8, TGF-β, and CTNN-β1 at 5% BC, while PLVAP at 2.5% BC. Antioxidant-related genes (SOD1, GSR) were downregulated in the cecum and colon with 2.5% BC. BC 5% promoted IL-8 in the jejunum, fostering inflammation and immune cell migration. It also induced genes regulating inflammatory responses (TGF-β) and gastrointestinal permeability (CTNN-β1). BC 5% enhanced antioxidant activity in the cecum and colon, but no significant impact on anti-myxo antibody production was observed. These results suggest that BC has significant effects on the rabbit gastrointestinal tract's inflammatory and antioxidant response, but further research is required to fully understand its histological and physiological impact."

      "abstract": "Calf management and health are essential for setting up the foundation of a productive cow. The objectives of this study were to estimate the impact of preweaning practices on milk production parameters while accounting for an animal's genetic potential in New Brunswick, Canada. A retrospective cohort study was performed on 220 heifer calves from eight herds born in 2014-2015. Preweaning practices and health data were recorded by producers and reviewed by the herd veterinarian for each calf. The herd veterinarian also visited the farms to collect serum samples from calves and frozen colostrum samples. The production outcomes assessed were milk, protein and fat yields, standardized to 305 d for the first lactation (L1) and a combined group of lactations two and three (L2 + 3). The genomic potential was determined as genomic parent averages (GPA) for the associated production parameters. Analysis was performed with multivariable linear (L1) and linear mixed (L2 + 3) regression models. In L1, for every 1.0 kg increase in weaning weight, milk, protein, and fat yield increased by 25.5, 0.82, and 1.01 kg, respectively (P < 0.006). Colostrum feeding time (CFT) positively impacted L1 milk and protein production, with feeding between 1-2 h of life producing the greatest estimates of 626 kg of milk and 18.2 kg of protein yield (P < 0.007), compared to earlier or later CFT. Fat yield production was decreased by 80.5 kg (P < 0.006) in L1 when evaluating animals that developed a preweaning disease and were not treated with antibiotics compared to healthy untreated animals. Impacts on L2 + 3 were similar across all production outcomes, with a positive interaction effect of CFT and weaning weight. Compared to CFT < 1 h, the later CFT groups of 1-2 h and > 2 h produced greater yield outcomes of 68.2 to 72.6 kg for milk (P < 0.006), 2.06 to 2.15 kg for protein (P < 0.005), and 1.8 to 1.9 kg for fat (P < 0.045) for every 1 kg increase of weaning weight, respectively. The fit of all models was significantly improved with the inclusion of GPA. These results indicate that colostrum management and preweaning health measures impacted production parameters as adults. The inclusion of GPA significantly improved the accuracy of the models, indicating that this can be an important parameter to include in future studies.",

This study aimed to determine short-term outcomes of early oral colostrum administration in VLBW neonates. METHODS: This open-label randomized controlled trial was conducted on VLBW neonates admitted to Mahdieh Hospital, Tehran, Iran, between February and December 2022. According to the protocol, all eligible neonates were randomized evenly to the intervention group, which received oral colostrum (OC), and the control group, which received no OC. Finally, short-term outcomes of early OC administration were compared between groups using the independent-samples t test, chi-square, and Fisher exact tests. RESULTS: Of 80 randomized neonates, 37 and 39 from the intervention and control groups entered the final analysis, respectively. Neonates in the intervention and control groups did not significantly differ in terms of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) infection (P = 0.728), sepsis (P = 0.904), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) (P > 0.999), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (P = 0.141), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (P = 0.923), and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (P = 0.633). Furthermore, there was no significant difference between groups considering the time to reach 120 cc/kg feeds (P = 0.557), time to reach birth weight (P = 0.157), length of hospitalization (P = 0.532), and mortality rate (P = 0.628). CONCLUSION: The results of our study revealed that despite safety, early OC administration did not improve any of the short-term outcomes in VLBW neonates."

      "abstract": "Diabetes is a metabolic illness marked by elevated levels of glucose in the bloodstream due to the inadequate production or use of insulin in the body. Diabetes can result in a range of consequences, with the most prevalent being cardiovascular disease, renal failure, vision loss, and limb removal. Natural compounds isolated from different sources, like colostrum, are the most important compounds for the treatment of diabetes. Colostrum is a form of lactation produced by mammals in the first days after giving birth to their offspring, having a rich source of constituents and showing multipharmacological properties. This review was prepared on the basis of a variety of authoritative search databases, including Google Scholar, Scopus, and PubMed. In addition, the publications and other online sources were also included. In the literature search, the terms \"colostrum,\" \"diabetes,\" \"uses,\" \"management,\" \"constituent,\" \"composition,\" \"alternative sources,\" \"mechanism of action,\" \"preclinical,\" \"clinical,\" \"marketed formulations,\" and \"patents\" were utilized as keywords and collected from last two decades. Colostrum has been utilized as a treatment for a wide variety of illnesses due to its active constituents. A variety of colostrums are available in the market, like goat colostrum, porcine colostrum, sheep colostrum, human colostrum and many more. They have the full potential of nutrients like minerals, vitamins, lactose, essential enzymes, proteins and high concentrations of immunoproteins. Mostly, the colostrums are used for treating diabetes and its complications. Preclinical and clinical studies of metabolic syndrome, especially on diabetes and its complications, were also reported at the National and International levels, which evidently prove that the use of colostrums in the long term can be beneficial for various ailments associated with diabetes. In general, the findings of this review indicate that supplementation with colostrum may hold promise as a novel therapeutic intervention for people who have diabetes and its complications; however, additional research is required to fully understand its mechanisms of action and determine the best possible dosage as well as the time period of supplementation.",

In this view, dairy fractions have attracted great scientific interest, due to their high content of bioactive compounds. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antiviral activity of whey and buttermilk enriched in proteins from hyperimmune bovine colostrum (HBC) against rotavirus. The enriched fractions were spray-dried and subsequently tested for their neutralizing activity against the bovine rotavirus WC3 strain in vitro, using differentiated Caco-2/TC7 cells. The highest antirotaviral activity was observed when whey and buttermilk were enriched in purified immunoglobulin G (IgG), showing complete rotavirus neutralization at concentrations of 3 and 6 mg mL-1 for whey and buttermilk, respectively. Additionally, the use of a crude immunoglobulin fraction also gave satisfactory results. The inhibitory activities of all samples significantly decreased after the application of heat, except for the IgG-enriched buttermilk which showed a slight increase of activity following the application of short-time treatments (75 or 85 °C for 20 s). This sample also showed a significant increase of activity (13%) after the application of low-intensity high hydrostatic pressure treatment (400 MPa for 5 min). The maximum loss of bioactivity was observed at 600 MPa for 10 min (31 and 20% for whey- and buttermilk-based formulas, respectively). This study provides relevant information on the potential of whey, buttermilk, and HBC to be part of functional products as complementary strategies to combat rotavirus infections.",

      "abstract": "Various studies have shown that oropharyngeal colostrum application (OPCA) is beneficial to preterm neonates. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess whether OPCA reduces the incidence of culture-proven neonatal sepsis in preterm neonates. Randomized controlled trials comparing OPCA with placebo or standard care in preterm neonates were included. Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Scopus, and CENTRAL were searched for studies published up to June 15, 2023. We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, version 2, for risk of bias assessment, the random-effects model (RevMan 5.4) for meta-analysis, and Gradepro software for assessing the certainty of evidence. Twenty-one studies involving 2393 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Four studies had a low risk of bias, whereas seven had a high risk. Oropharyngeal colostrum significantly reduced the incidence of culture-proven sepsis (18 studies, 1990 neonates, risk ratio [RR]: 0.78, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.65, 0.94), mortality (18 studies, 2117 neonates, RR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.59, 0.90), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) (17 studies, 1692 neonates, RR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.82), feeding intolerance episodes (four studies, 445 neonates, RR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.38, 0.92), and the time to full enteral feeding (19 studies, 2142 neonates, mean difference: -2 to 21 days, 95% CI: -3.44, -0.99 days). There was no reduction in intraventricular hemorrhage, retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, neurodevelopmental abnormalities, hospital stay duration, time to full oral feeding, weight at discharge, pneumonia, and duration of antibiotic therapy. The certainty of the evidence was high for the outcomes of culture-positive sepsis and mortality, moderate for NEC, low for time to full enteral feeding, and very low for feeding intolerance. OPCA reduces culture-positive sepsis and mortality (high certainty), NEC (moderate certainty), and time to full enteral feeding (low certainty) in preterm neonates. However, scarcity of data from extremely premature infants limits the generalizability of these results to this population.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effect of Andrographis paniculata (A. paniculata) supplementation in sow diets before and after farrowing on the sow and piglets' performances during early postpartum period and on sows' backfat and longissimus muscle losses during lactation. METHODS: Seventy Landrace×Yorkshire sows and their offspring (1,186 piglets) were distributed into three groups: control (n = 31), treatment-250 (n = 18), and treatment-1000 (n = 21). From 110.2±0.7 days of gestation until farrowing (5.8 days) and throughout the lactation period (25.2 days), sows in the control group were given the conventional lactation diet, while sows in the treatment-250 and treatment-1000 groups received supplements of 250 ppm and 1,000 ppm of A. paniculata, respectively. RESULTS: In sows with parity 3-5, piglets from the treatment-1000 group had higher colostrum intake than the control and treatment-250 groups (p<0.05), but not in sows with parity 6-9. Colostrum immunoglobulin G (IgG) increased in treated sows versus controls for parity 6-9 (p<0.05), but was consistent for parity 3-5. Piglet performance until day 3 postnatal was similar across groups (p>0.05). Treatment-250 sows had higher feed intake post-farrowing than treatment-1000 sows (p<0.05). Longissimus loss was less in both treatment groups than control (p<0.05), but backfat loss was similar across groups (p>0.05). Post-partum complications were consistent across groups (p>0.05). Farrowing duration and piglet birth intervals in sows with parity 6-9 were prolonged in the treatment-1000 group. CONCLUSION: Supplementing with 1,000 ppm A. paniculata for 5.8 days pre-farrowing and 25.2 days post-farrowing enhanced sow colostrum IgG and piglet colostrum intake, while also reducing longissimus loss in sows. However, for sows of parity 6-9, this supplementation led to prolonged farrowing, increased intervals between piglet births, increased stillbirth, and reduced piglet birth weight. These effects should be considered when using A. paniculata supplementation."

Because of the individual and seasonal variability in colostrum yield and composition, maintaining an adequate supply of high-quality colostrum year-round remains a challenge for commercial dairy producers. In this narrative review, we described the individual, seasonal, and herd-level variability of colostrum production and summarized the association between individual animal factors such as parity, sex of the calf, calf birth weight, as well as indicators of the cow's metabolic status and the yield and composition of colostrum. Further, we reviewed the current knowledge on the influence of prepartum nutrition and management strategies on colostrum production. Research on the metabolizable energy and protein supplied in the prepartum diet as well as on the inclusion and source of vitamins, minerals, and feed additives suggests prepartum nutrition influences the yield, quality, and composition of colostrum. Furthermore, the prepartum environment and dry period length remain influential factors in the production of colostrum. However, additional research is needed to understand the mechanisms by which prepartum nutrition and management affect colostrum production. Finally, time from calving to colostrum harvest and oxytocin administration as well as the current knowledge on the effect of heat treatment and colostrum storage strategies on colostral components were discussed. To conclude, we identify critical gaps in knowledge for future focus of investigation in colostrum research.",

The present study determined the effect of sow feed levels during the transition period on colostrum yield, colostrum immunoglobulin (Ig) G, colostrum intake of piglets, farrowing duration, proportion of stillborn piglets per litter (SB) and the incidence of farrowing assistance in highly prolific sows. A total of 114 Landrace × Yorkshire crossbred sows and their offspring (n = 2 072) were included in the experiment. Sows were assigned to different feed supply levels from entry to farrowing at 110 days of gestation until farrowing based on their parity number. Three feed-level groups were the control group who received 3.0 kg/day of lactation feed (n = 40), treatment 1 group who received 3.6 kg/day of gestation feed (n = 39) and treatment 2 group who received 4.0 kg/day of lactation feed (n = 35). Colostrum samples (5 ml) were obtained from the sows within 3 h after the onset of farrowing for IgG assay. Piglets were weighed immediately after birth and then again 17-24 h later to estimate their colostrum intake. Colostrum yield was determined by aggregating the colostrum intake of piglets within the litter. The total number of piglets born, SB and farrowing duration were 18.2 ± 3.8, 7.5% and 259.1 ± 138.1 min, respectively. Among these sows, 28.9% experienced a farrowing duration exceeding 300 min and 50.9% required assistance during farrowing. Interestingly, piglets in the treatment 2 group demonstrated a greater colostrum intake (403.1 ± 14.9 g) compared to the control group (360.6 ± 15.1 g, P = 0.046) and the treatment 1 group (361.0 ± 12.9 g, P = 0.033). On average, colostrum yield of sows in the treatment 2 group tended to be higher than in the control group (+0.5 kg, P = 0.081), but did not differ from the treatment 1 group (+0.3 kg, P = 0.191). No significant differences in farrowing duration, SB, farrowing assistance, or colostrum IgG concentration were found across various feed-level groups (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the study showed that raising lactation feed by 1.0 kg/day prefarrowing increased piglet colostrum intake and tended to boost sow colostrum production, without significantly affecting farrowing duration, stillbirth rates, or need for assistance.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Quantify the minimum individual cow colostral immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration required for pooling to achieve adequate transfer of passive immunity in calves. ANIMALS: 201 Jersey cows. METHODS: Colostrum was collected from 28 pools and heat treated before being fed to calves or stored. Parity, total number of cows contributing to the pool, individual cow colostral volume contributions, and total volume of each colostrum pool were recorded. Colostrum IgG concentrations in individual and pooled (pre- and post-heat treatment) samples were analyzed by radial immunodiffusion and Brix refractometry. Colostral IgG concentration of ≥ 50g/L was considered the current recommended dairy industry standard for acceptable colostrum quality. Multivariable models were performed to determine factors affecting pooled colostral IgG concentrations. The minimum colostral IgG concentration required for pooling to achieve the recommended total mass of at least 200g IgG to be fed to a calf was calculated. RESULTS: Total pool volume and the number of cows contributing to the pool were significant factors affecting IgG concentration. Colostrum pools from ≤ 7 cows, with a minimum pool IgG concentration of 70.4 g/L (22.9% Brix) or colostrum pool volume ≤ 40 L, with a minimum pool IgG concentration of 66.2 g/L (21.8% Brix) achieved the recommended total mass of at least 200g IgG in 4L of colostrum. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: When feeding pooled colostrum, IgG concentrations higher than the industry standard of 50 g/L is recommended to reduce the risk of failure of transfer of passive immunity in calves.",

      "abstract": "In the modern swine industry, inflammation and pain in sows after farrowing represent a crucial animal welfare concern. Cannabis sativa, a medicinal plant, has analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties and is rich in fibre. The objective of this study is to examine the impacts of supplementing sows with Cannabis sativa byproducts during transition periods (7 days before and after farrowing) on various aspects including postpartum behaviour, feed intake, constipation, farrowing duration, colostrum yield and piglet performance. The experiment involved a total of 100 Landrace × Yorkshire sows. The sows were distributed according to parity numbers into two groups, i.e., control (n = 54) and treatment (n = 46). The control group was provided with a lactation diet at 3.0-3.5 kg per day for a period of 7 days before and after farrowing. The treatment groups received the same quantity of the diet but with an additional supplementation of 150 g/d of Cannabis sativa byproduct. The byproduct was analysed and contained 0.24 % (w/w) cannabidiol (CBD), resulting in a daily intake of 360 mg of CBD per sow. The conventional lactational diet had a dietary fibre content of 4.3 %, whereas the diet supplemented with Cannabis sativa byproduct had a higher dietary fibre content of 16.9 %. Video cameras were used to observe and document the behaviour of sows within the initial 24 h after farrowing. The duration in which sows engaged in activities such as sleeping, sitting, standing, feeding and nursing their piglets was quantified. Additionally, the rectal temperature of the sows was measured, and a temperature equal to or exceeding 39.5 °C was considered indicative of fever. The faecal score of the sows was assessed, and a faecal score of ≤2 was classified as constipation. On the third day postpartum, the proportion of sows with fever in the treatment group was lower than that in the control group (20.0 % and 38.9 % respectively, P = 0.051). Sows receiving supplementation with Cannabis sativa byproducts exhibited increased durations of standing and feeding compared to those in the control group (P < 0.05). Notably, overall, sows without constipation issues spent more time consuming feed than those experiencing constipation (P = 0.006). The prevalence of constipation was significantly lower in the treatment group compared to the control group (17.4 % and 81.5 %, respectively, P < 0.001). Furthermore, the postpartum sows demonstrated increased feed intake following supplementation with Cannabis sativa byproducts (P < 0.05). Sow colostrum yield, piglet colostrum intake, piglet mortality and other piglet traits did not differ between the control and treatment groups (P > 0.05). In conclusion, supplementing Cannabis sativa byproducts during the transition periods in peri-parturient sows under tropical conditions resulted in a reduction in constipation issues and improved sow activities, such as increased time spent standing and consuming feed within the first 24 h postpartum.",

      "abstract": "Infectious diarrhea is a World Health Organization public health priority area due to the lack of effective vaccines and an accelerating global antimicrobial resistance crisis. New strategies are urgently needed such as immunoprophylactic for prevention of diarrheal diseases. Hyperimmune bovine colostrum (HBC) is an established and effective prophylactic for infectious diarrhea. The commercial HBC product, Travelan® (Immuron Ltd, Australia) targets multiple strains of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is highly effective in preventing diarrhea in human clinical studies. Although Travelan® targets ETEC, preliminary studies suggested cross-reactivity with other Gram-negative enteric pathogens including Shigella and Salmonella species. For this study we selected an invasive diarrheal/dysentery-causing enteric pathogen, Shigella, to evaluate the effectiveness of Travelan®, both in vitro and in vivo. Here we demonstrate broad cross-reactivity of Travelan® with all four Shigella spp. (S. flexneri, S. sonnei, S. dysenteriae and S. boydii) and important virulence factor Shigella antigens. Naïve juvenile rhesus macaques (NJRM) were randomized, 8 dosed with Travelan® and 4 with a placebo intragastrically twice daily over 6 days. All NJRM were challenged with S. flexneri 2a strain 2457T on the 4th day of treatment and monitored for diarrheal symptoms. All placebo-treated NJRM displayed acute dysentery symptoms within 24-36 hours of challenge. Two Travelan®-treated NJRM displayed dysentery symptoms and six animals remained healthy and symptom-free post challenge; resulting in 75% efficacy of prevention of shigellosis (p = 0.014). These results strongly indicate that Travelan® is functionally cross-reactive and an effective prophylactic for shigellosis. This has positive implications for the prophylactic use of Travelan® for protection against both ETEC and Shigella spp. diarrheal infections. Future refinement and expansion of pathogens recognized by HBC including Travelan® could revolutionize current management of gastrointestinal infections and outbreaks in travelers' including military, peacekeepers, humanitarian workers and in populations living in endemic regions of the world.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Patients with femur fracture after surgery are at risk of malnutrition, weight loss, disability, and mobility complications. In the present study the role of colostrum supplementation on physical disability, and some nutritional variables after surgery has been investigated. RESEARCH METHODS & PROCEDURES: Patients were randomly assigned to two groups. The intervention group received 45 g colostrum and the control group received 15 g whey protein daily for 21 days (each containing 12 g of protein). The trend comparison during 30 days of variables including weight, appetite, serum albumin level, hemoglobin and lymphocytes between the two groups was modeled with the generalized estimation equation. Moreover, the trend comparison during 90 days of Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) between the two groups was calculated. RESULTS: The basic characteristics were the same between the two groups (colostrum, n = 46; control, n = 48). Protein intake was the same in both groups during the study period. There was a significant difference in weight gain (ß = 0.32, 95 % CI: 0.09-0.54; P = 0.005) within 30 days after operation between the colostrum and control groups in favor of the increase in the colostrum group. Compared to the control group, patients in the colostrum group had a 0.31 score more appetite (P < 0.001), 0.17 g/dL higher serum albumin level (P = 0.001), 0.5 mg/dL higher hemoglobin level and 440 more blood lymphocytes (P < 0.001) during the 30 days of intervention. Regarding physical function disability, patients in the colostrum group had about 4 ODI scores lower than the control group during the study period. CONCLUSION: Colostrum supplement can increase appetite, hemoglobin, serum albumin level and the number of blood lymphocytes more than the control group. It can also accelerate weight gain and physical performance after surgery.",

Two groups of six kids were treated with the extract. One group received three supplies of colostrum from does naturally positive for SRLV, treated with the ethyl acetate fraction of M. azedarach (EAF-MA) for three days, while the other group consumed milk from does also carrying the virus with the respective extract twice a day for five days. After undergoing treatment, all animals began to receive thermized milk until weaning (60 days) and were monitored for six months using nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) and western blot (WB) tests. The study revealed cumulative percentages of positive animals in WB or nPCR in the milk group of 66.66% on the seventh day, 83.33% in the following week, and 100% at 120 days, while the colostrum group showed values of 66.66% at 14 days, 83.33% at 90 days, and 100% at 120 days. Variation and intermittency were observed in viral detection, but all animals tested positive in WB or nPCR at some point. A potential delay in infection was observed, which was more significant in the colostrum group. The need for the combination of serological and molecular tests for a more efficient detection of the disease is also emphasized.",

      "abstract": "Ornidazole is frequently used for the prevention and treatment of anaerobic infections after caesarean section. There is still a lack of data on the excretion of ornidazole in breast milk. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the transfer of ornidazole into colostrum and to assess the risk of infant exposure to the drug via breast milk. Population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted using datasets of plasma and milk concentrations obtained from 77 breastfeeding women to examine the excretion kinetics of ornidazole. Various factors that may affect the excretion of ornidazole were investigated. The final model was then used to simulate ornidazole concentration-time profiles in both plasma and milk. The drug exposure in body fluids and the potential risk for breastfeeding were assessed based on the safety threshold. Plasma ornidazole concentration data could be described well by a one-compartment model, and concentrations in breast milk were linked to this model using an estimated milk-to-plasma concentration ratio (MPRcon). Significant variables that influenced drug exposure and MPRcon were identified as total bilirubin levels (TBIL) and postnatal sampling time, respectively. Simulations showed that women with abnormal liver function (TBIL > 17 μmol/L) had higher ornidazole levels in plasma and milk than those with normal liver function (TBIL < 17 μmol/L), but the exposures through colostrum of lactating women from both groups were below the safety threshold. This work provides a simple and feasible strategy for the prediction of drug exposure in breast milk and the assessment of breastfeeding safety."

It should be emphasized that achieving high results in competitive sports requires the use of significant, sometimes extreme, exercise loads during training, which may result in homeostasis disorders, adversely affecting the fitness of athletes. This study aims to investigate the effects of 6 months of bovine colostrum supplementation on indicators of immune system functioning, selected parameters related to iron management, and anabolic/catabolic balance in young football players. Twenty-eight male football players completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover protocol (24 weeks of colostrum/placebo). A standardized exercise test was executed at the beginning of the trial and after 3 and 6 months of supplementation. Blood samples were taken before and after the exercise test and after 3 h of recovery. Markers of iron homeostasis, pro- and anti-inflammatory balance, and hormonal responses were determined. A significant increase in immunoglobulin G concentration was observed, accompanied by a decrease in inflammatory markers in supplemented athletes. Bovine colostrum supplementation had no significant effect on athletes' performance or on iron management and hormonal response. The use of bovine colostrum, which is characterized by a high content of immunologically active compounds, can be an element of a relatively mild and safe intervention for reducing inflammation induced by intense physical exercise.",

      "abstract": "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) may cause difficult-to-treat infections in dairy cattle. One possible route of MRSA transmission into calves is via the feeding of contaminated waste milk. We tested the heat resistance of 17 MRSA strains isolated from German dairy farms in colostrum and raw milk in a laboratory approach. Heating colostrum or raw milk at 60 °C for 30 min eliminated all viable MRSA in the milk, provided the MRSA inoculation rate is low (103 cfu mL-1). In contrast, raw milk highly inoculated with MRSA (106 cfu mL-1) required a holding time of at least 30 min at 70 °C to fully eliminate MRSA from it. However, quantitative analysis showed that a heat treatment for 10 min at 60 °C already significantly reduced the number of viable MRSA in highly inoculated raw milk. Heating colostrum and raw milk above 60 °C may destroy immunoglobulins which are crucial for the calf's health. Therefore, we suggest that colostrum and raw milk that is to be fed to calves on MRSA-positive dairy farms is heated at 60 °C for at least 10 min to reduce the likelihood of transmitting MRSA. In addition, the 60 °C heat-treated colostrum/raw milk should be fed to the calves as soon as possible to avoid re-growth of viable MRSA."

      "abstract": "The preweaning period for a dairy calf is characterized by high morbidity and mortality rates, leading to financial losses for producers. Identifying strategies to improve the health and welfare of calves while reducing antimicrobial use continues to be crucial to the success of the dairy industry. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of feeding colostrum replacer (CR) to dairy heifer calves beyond d 1 of life on growth, serum IgG, the incidence of diarrhea and bovine respiratory disease (BRD), and the risk of mortality in the preweaning period. At birth, Holstein heifer calves (n = 200; 50/treatment) weighing 40.7 ± 0.35 kg (mean ± SE) were fed 3.2 L of CR (205 g IgG/feeding) at 0 h and 12 h of life. Calves were then randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments: 450 g of milk replacer (MR) from d 2 to 14 (control, CON), 380 g of CR + 225 g of MR from d 2 to 3, then 450 g of MR from d 4 to 14 (transition, TRAN), 45 g of CR + 450 g of MR from d 2 to 14 (extended, EXT); or 380 g of CR + 225 g of MR from d 2 to 3, then 45 g of CR + 450 g of MR from d 4 to 14 (transition + extended, TRAN+EXT). Each treatment was reconstituted to 3 L and fed twice daily. All CR treatments were fed using bovine-derived CR containing 27% IgG. From d 15 to 41, all calves were fed 600 g of MR reconstituted to 4 L twice daily. Body weight was recorded at birth and every 7 d until study completion on d 49. Blood samples were taken daily until d 7 to evaluate serum IgG and then every 7 d until d 49. A health assessment was performed daily to evaluate calves for BRD and diarrhea. Data were analyzed using mixed linear regression, mixed logistic regression, and survival analysis models in SAS 9.4. Serum IgG concentrations were not affected by treatment for the study period. The EXT and TRAN+EXT groups had greater average daily gain (ADG) from d 7 to 14 (0.14 kg/d) and the TRAN group had greater ADG from d 14 to 21 (0.11 kg/d), compared with CON. There was no association of treatment with the odds or the duration of a diarrhea bout. However, provision of CR to the TRAN and EXT calves was associated with a reduced hazard of diarrhea compared with CON calves. Furthermore, TRAN and EXT calves have a lower hazard of mortality compared with CON calves, with TRAN and EXT calves had a 2.8- and 3.8-times lower hazard of mortality, respectively. Our findings suggest that the supplementation of CR to dairy calves positively affects ADG, and reduces the hazard of diarrhea and mortality during the preweaning period. Future research should look to further refine the supplementation strategy of CR to calves and explore the mechanism of action.",

      "abstract": "Bovine colostrum (BC) is the initial milk an animal produces after giving birth, particularly in the first few days. Numerous bioactive substances found in BC, including proteins, enzymes, growth factors, immunoglobulins, etc., are beneficial to human health. BC has a significant role to play as part of a healthy diet, with well-documented health and nutritional advantages for people. Therefore, the use of BC and its crucial derivatives in the development of functional food and pharmaceuticals for the prevention of several diseases such as gastrointestinal and respiratory system disorders is becoming increasingly popular around the world. A novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases that is called Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China. After the first SARS-CoV-2 virus-related fatality was announced, the illness quickly spread throughout China and to other continents, causing a pandemic. Since then, numerous studies have been initiated to develop safe and efficient treatments. To prevent viral infection and potential lingering effects, it is important to investigate alternative treatments for COVID-19. Due to its effective bioactive profile and its immunomodulatory roles in biological processes, BC might be considered a promising approach to assist in combating people affected by the SARS-CoV-2 or prevention from the virus. BC has immunomodulatory effects because to its high concentration of bioactive components such as immunoglobulins, lactoferrin, cytokines, and growth factors, etc., which might help control immunological responses, potentially fostering a balanced immune response. Furthermore, its bioactive components have a potential cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2, aiding in virus neutralization and its comprehensive food profile also supplies important vitamins, minerals, and amino acids, fostering a healthy immune system. Hence, the possible contributions of BC to the management of COVID-19 were reviewed in this article based on the most recent research on the subject. Additionally, the key BC components that influence immune system modulation were evaluated. These components may serve as potential mediators or therapeutic advantages in COVID-19.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oropharyngeal administration of colostrum (OAC) has an immune-stimulating effect on oropharyngeal-associated lymphoid tissue, and can promote the maturation of the gastrointestinal tract. However, how OAC promotes intestinal maturation in preterm infants by altering gut microbiota remains unclear. We aim to assess changes in gut microbiota and metabolites after OAC in very preterm infants. METHODS: A multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial will be conducted in three large neonatal intensive care units in Shenzhen, China, with preterm infants with gestational age less than 32 weeks at birth and birth weight less than 1500 g. It is estimated that 320 preterm infants will be enrolled in this study within one year. The intervention group will receive oropharyngeal administration of 0.2 ml colostrum every 3 h, starting between the first 48 to 72 h and continued for 5 consecutive days. Following a similar administration scheme, the control group will receive oropharyngeal administration of sterile water. Stool samples will be collected at the first defecation, as well as on the 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th days after birth for analysis of effect of OAC on gut microbiota and metabolites through 16sRNA gene sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. DISCUSSION: This proposal advocates for the promotion of OAC as a safe and relatively beneficial protocol in neonatal intensive care units, which may contribute to the establishment of a dominant intestinal flora. Findings of this study may help improve the health outcomes of preterm infants by establishment of targeted gut microbiota in future studies.

      "abstract": "The intestinal barrier comprises a single layer of epithelial cells tightly joined to form a physical barrier. Disruption or compromise of the intestinal barrier can lead to the inadvertent activation of immune cells, potentially causing an increased risk of chronic inflammation in various tissues. Recent research has suggested that specific dietary components may influence the function of the intestinal barrier, potentially offering a means to prevent or mitigate inflammatory disorders. However, the precise mechanism underlying these effects remains unclear. Bovine colostrum (BC), the first milk from cows after calving, is a natural source of nutrients with immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and gut-barrier fortifying properties. This novel study sought to investigate the transcriptome in BC-treated Zonulin transgenic mice (Ztm), characterized by dysbiotic microbiota, intestinal hyperpermeability, and mild hyperactivity, applying RNA sequencing. Seventy-five tissue samples from the duodenum, colon, and brain of Ztm and wild-type (WT) mice were dissected, processed, and RNA sequenced. The expression profiles were analyzed and integrated to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed transcripts (DETs). These were then further examined using bioinformatics tools. RNA-seq analysis identified 1298 DEGs and 20,952 DETs in the paired (Ztm treatment vs. Ztm control) and reference (WT controls) groups. Of these, 733 DEGs and 10,476 DETs were upregulated, while 565 DEGs and 6097 DETs were downregulated. BC-treated Ztm female mice showed significant upregulation of cingulin (Cgn) and claudin 12 (Cldn12) duodenum and protein interactions, as well as molecular pathways and interactions pertaining to tight junctions, while BC-treated Ztm males displayed an upregulation of transcripts like occludin (Ocln) and Rho/Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2 (Arhgf2) and cellular structures and interfaces, protein-protein interactions, and organization and response mechanisms. This comprehensive analysis reveals the influence of BC treatment on tight junctions (TJs) and Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) signaling pathway gene expressions. The present study is the first to analyze intestinal and brain samples from BC-treated Ztm mice applying high-throughput RNA sequencing. This study revealed molecular interaction in intestinal barrier function and identified hub genes and their functional pathways and biological processes in response to BC treatment in Ztm mice. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore their implications for dietary interventions aimed at improving intestinal barrier integrity and function. The MGH Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee authorized the animal study (2013N000013).",

      "abstract": "Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a leading cause of bacterial diarrhea with the potential to cause long-term gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction. Preventative treatments for ETEC-induced diarrhea exist, yet the effects of these treatments on GI commensals in healthy individuals are unclear. Whether administration of a prophylactic preventative treatment for ETEC-induced diarrhea causes specific shifts in gut microbial populations in controlled environments is also unknown. Here, we studied the effects of a hyperimmune bovine colostrum (IMM-124E) used in the manufacture of Travelan (AUST L 106709) on GI bacteria in healthy C57BL/6 mice. Using next-generation sequencing, we aimed to test the onset and magnitude of potential changes to the mouse gut microbiome in response to the antidiarrheagenic hyperimmune bovine colostrum product, rich in immunoglobulins against select ETEC strains (Travelan, Immuron Ltd). We show that in mice administered colostrum containing lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antibodies, there was an increased abundance of potentially gut-beneficial bacteria, such as Akkermansia and Desulfovibrio, without disrupting the underlying ecology of the GI tract. Compared to controls, there was no difference in overall weight gain, body or cecal weights, or small intestine length following LPS antibody colostrum supplementation. Overall, dietary supplementation with colostrum containing LPS antibodies produced subtle alterations in the gut bacterial composition of mice. Primarily, Travelan LPS antibody treatment decreased the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes in gut microbial populations in unchallenged healthy mice. Further studies are required to examine the effect of Travelan LPS antibody treatment to engineer the microbiome in a diseased state and during recovery.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prompt diagnosis of passive transfer failure in the neonatal period is important for early treatment. OBJECTIVES: To compare the diagnostic performance of serum glutaraldehyde coagulation test (GCT) and colostrum BRIX% for failure to transfer passive immunity (FTPI) diagnosis with the results of SNAP foal test and to evaluate the results of serum GCT and colostrum BRIX% measurements in foals with diarrhoea in the 0-1 month period. STUDY DESIGN: In vitro experiments. METHODS: Excess serum and colostrum (n: 298) from samples collected from newborn foals and their dams for clinical purposes were used. Foals were classified as FTPI positive (IgG < 8 g/L) or negative (IgG ≥ 8 g/L) using the SNAP foal test. We compared the sensitivity and specificity of serum GCT and colostrum BRIX % for diagnosing FTPI in all foals and in the sub-group of foals which developed diarrhoea within the first month of life was noted. The relationships between the results of the serum GCT and colostrum BRIX% and diarrhoea in foals with and without FTPI were evaluated. RESULTS: Serum GCT and colostrum BRIX % were statistically significantly different (p < 0.05) between the foals without FTPI and with FTPI classified according to the SNAP test. Using a cut-off value for serum GCT of >10, sensitivity was 100% (95% CI 92.9%-100%) and specificity 100% (98.3%-100%) while with a cut-off value of ≤24, with colostrum BRIX% of ≤24 sensitivity was 92% (80.9%-97.8%), and specificity was 98% (95.3-99.3). In the sub-group of foals without FTPI using a colostrum BRIX% cut-off value of ≤26 the sensitivity for prediction of diarrhoea in the 0-1 month period was only 72.4% (52.8-87.3, p < 0.001) with specificity 54.3% (47.6-61.1) but the test performance was not robust (ROC AUC 0.61). MAIN LIMITATIONS: The number of repeated measurements in the evaluation of serum GCT, and colostrum BRIX% was low. More clinical problems could be examined. CONCLUSIONS: The serum GCT, and colostrum BRIX%, both economical and practical to use in the field, gave results comparable with the SNAP foal IgG test. The ability to accurately predict diarrhoea in the first month of life with these tests was limited.",

METHOD: Non-randomized clinical trial, carried out with 138 mother-child pairs attended at a public maternity hospital. The treatment group used raw colostrum, dripping 4 drops (0.2 ml) into the oropharyngeal mucosa, totaling 8 administrations in 24 h, up to the 7th complete day of life (OCI). The control group was composed of newborns admitted to the same maternity hospital before the implementation of the OCI. Analyzes were performed: descriptive, bivariate, multiple logistic regression, and survival analysis, with a significance level of 5% and 95% CI. RESULTS: The treatment group had an RR of death of 0.26 (95% CI = 0.07-0.67; p = 0.00), adjusted for maternal age, marital status, gestational hypertension, type of delivery, number of prenatal visits, and birth weight. Number Needed to Treat (NNT) demonstrated that for every 5 individuals treated with OCI, one death was prevented NNT = 4.9 (95% CI = 1.84-5.20); however, for PTNB with VLBW who remained hospitalized for 50, 100 and 150 days, the NNT reduces to 4, 4 and 3, respectively.

Colostrum and milk samples from Month 0 (M0), 2 (M2), 4 (M4) and 6 (M6) were analysed using whole-genome shotgun-sequencing. The microbial diversity from antibiotic-treated groups was different and higher than that of the non-antibiotic group. This difference was more evident in milk compared to colostrum, with increasing diversity seen only in antibiotic-treated groups. The microbiome of antibiotic-treated groups clustered separately from the non-antibiotic group at M2-, M4- and M6 milk samples, showing the effect of antibiotic treatment on between-group (beta) diversity. The non-antibiotic group did not show a high relative abundance of mastitis-causing pathogens during early lactation and was more associated with genera such as Psychrobacter, Serratia, Gordonibacter and Brevibacterium. A high relative abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) was observed in the milk of antibiotic-treated groups with the Cephaguard group showing a significantly high abundance of genes conferring resistance to cephalosporin, aminoglycoside and penam classes. The data support the use of non-antibiotic alternatives for drying off in cows."

In breast cancer, macrophages play a significant role in immune infiltration and contribute to the progression and spread of tumors. However, studies suggest that these cells can be reprogrammed to act as an antitumor immune response. This study aimed to evaluate the levels of melatonin and its receptors, MT1 (melatonin receptor 1) and MT2 (melatonin receptor 2), in colostrum and assess the differentiation and polarization of the colostrum macrophages modulated by melatonin in the presence of breast tumor cells. Colostrum samples were collected from 116 mothers and tested for their melatonin and receptor levels. The colostrum cells were treated with or without melatonin and then cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of breast tumor cells. The results showed that melatonin treatment increased the expression of MT1 and MT2 in the colostrum cells. Furthermore, melatonin treatment increased the percentage of M1 macrophages and decreased the percentage of M2 macrophages. When the colostrum macrophages were cocultured with breast tumor cells, melatonin reduced the percentage of both macrophage phenotypes and the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 8 (IL-8). These data suggest that melatonin can regulate the inflammatory process via M1 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment and, simultaneously, the progression of M2 macrophages that favor tumorigenesis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Severe alcoholic hepatitis (SAH) is associated with high mortality. Numerous studies and meta-analysis have reported that corticosteroids reduce the 28-day mortality in SAH, but not the 6-month mortality. Therefore, newer treatments for SAH need to be studied. A pilot study from our group had recently treated ten patients with SAH with bovine colostrum (BC) [20 g thrice in a day for 8 weeks] and prednisolone. This therapy improved the biological functions and 3-month mortality. However, as more and more data showed the failure of corticosteroids to improve the 3- and 6-month mortality, especially in patients with high mDF and MELD scores, we planned this trial to study the safety and efficacy of BC (without corticosteroids) in the treatment of SAH. METHOD: This is a multicenter, parallel, double-blind, randomized (1:1) placebo-controlled trial, which will enroll 174 patients with SAH from 5 academic centers in the India. Patients will receive freeze-dried BC or placebo by random 1:1 allocation for 4 weeks. The primary outcome measure is survival at 3 months. The secondary outcome measures are survival at 1 month, change in mDF and MELD scores, change in endotoxin and cytokines (alpha TNF, IL6, and IL8) levels, number of episodes of sepsis [pneumonia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), cellulitis, urinary tract infection (UTI)] from baseline to 4 weeks. DISCUSSION: This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of bovine colostrum in improving the survival of patients with SAH. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02473341.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of bovine colostrum milk supplementation on metabolic changes and the expression of various biomarkers on inflammation, antioxidant and oxidative damage, nutrient metabolism, and genomic stability among older adults. Older adults (50-69 years old) who participated in the 12-week randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial were instructed to consume the IgCo bovine colostrum-enriched skim milk or regular skim milk (placebo) twice daily. Following 12 weeks of intervention, participants in the intervention group had lower expression levels in pro-inflammatory mediators (CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α), with significant (p < 0.05) interaction effects of the group and time observed. However, no significant interaction effect was observed in the vitamin D, telomerase, 8-OHdG, MDA, and SOD activities. UPLC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics analysis revealed that 22 metabolites were upregulated and 11 were downregulated in the intervention group compared to the placebo group. Glycerophospholipid metabolism, along with cysteine and methionine metabolism were identified as the potential metabolic pathways that are associated with bovine colostrum milk consumption. In conclusion, consuming bovine colostrum milk may induce metabolic changes and reduce the expression of various pro-inflammatory mediators, thus improving the immune function in older adults.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Gut immaturity leads to feeding difficulties in very preterm infants (<32 weeks gestation at birth). Maternal milk (MM) is the optimal diet but often absent or insufficient. We hypothesized that bovine colostrum (BC), rich in protein and bioactive components, improves enteral feeding progression, relative to preterm formula (PF), when supplemented to MM. Aim of the study is to determine whether BC supplementation to MM during the first 14 days of life shortens the time to full enteral feeding (120 mL/kg/d, TFF120). METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial at seven hospitals in South China without access to human donor milk and with slow feeding progression. Infants were randomly assigned to receive BC or PF when MM was insufficient. Volume of BC was restricted by recommended protein intake (4-4.5 g/kg/d). Primary outcome was TFF120. Feeding intolerance, growth, morbidities and blood parameters were recorded to assess safety. RESULTS: A total of 350 infants were recruited. BC supplementation had no effect on TFF120 in intention-to-treat analysis [n (BC) = 171, n (PF) = 179; adjusted hazard ratio, aHR: 0.82 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.06); P = 0.13]. Body growth and morbidities did not differ, but more cases of periventricular leukomalacia were detected in the infants fed BC (5/155 vs. 0/181, P = 0.06). Blood chemistry and hematology data were similar between the intervention groups. CONCLUSIONS: BC supplementation during the first two weeks of life did not reduce TFF120 and had only marginal effects on clinical variables. Clinical effects of BC supplementation on very preterm infants in the first weeks of life may depend on feeding regimen and remaining milk diet. TRIAL REGISTRATION: http://www.

This study aims to test whether promoting a positive emotion intervention, 'Three Good Things' intervention, during the last trimester of pregnancy can enhance early colostrum secretion and breastfeeding behaviours by modulating the hormones associated with lactation (prolactin and insulin-like growth factor I). We will attempt to promote exclusive breastfeeding by using physiological behavioural measures. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is designed as a randomised controlled trial conducted in the Women's Hospital School of Medicine at Zhejiang University and the Wuyi First People's Hospital. The participants will be randomly divided into two groups using stratified random grouping: the intervention group will receive 'Three Good Things' intervention, while the control group will write about three things that come to mind first. These interventions will be continued from enrolment until the day of delivery. Maternal blood hormone levels will be tested approaching delivery and the following day after birth. Behavioural information about breastfeeding will be collected 1 week afterwards. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the Ethics Committees of the Women's Hospital School of Medicine at Zhejiang University and the Wuyi First People's Hospital. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals or international academic conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR2000038849.",

The aim of the study was to assess the possibility of using BC for the prevention and treatment of infectious and non-infectious diseases. Material and methods. The search for scientific information on the study of the component composition, immunobiological properties and the use of BC in clinical practice was carried out using the databases of the RSCI, CyberLeninka, ScienceDirect, PubMed. Results. The macro- and micronutrient composition of BC is presented, its changes over time from the moment of calving are described. A comparative analysis of the content of various components in milk and colostrum is presented. A detailed list of antimicrobial factors that increase nonspecific resistance and provide immunocorrective, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects is submitted. The possibility of using BC in clinical practice as a part of complex therapy in the treatment of various infectious diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by the new coronavirus infe ction SARS-CoV-2, as well as in cardiovascular diseases, allergies, autoimmune and oncological diseases, has been demonstrated. Conclusion. According to the literature, BC has a high safety profile and is applicable to all age groups of the population. Given the wide range of biological activity of BC components, a promising area of scientific research is the development of the products for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes, including dietary supplements, based on its ingredients, which have the desired properties for correcting the immune status, preventing non-communicable and infectious diseases, as well as for prevention of occupational diseases among persons working in harmful working conditions.",

Here, we evaluated how fish oil and/or probiotics supplementation modify concentrations of colostrum immune mediators and their associations with perinatal clinical factors on mothers with overweight/obesity. METHODS AND RESULTS: Pregnant women were randomized in a double-blind manner into four intervention groups, and the supplements were consumed daily from early pregnancy onwards. Colostrum samples were collected from 187 mothers, and 16 immune mediators were measured using bead-based immunoassays. Interventions modified colostrum composition; the fish oil+probiotics group had higher concentrations of IL-12p70 than probiotics+placebo and higher FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT-3L) than fish oil+placebo and probiotics+placebo (one-way analysis of variance, post-hoc Tukey's test). Although the fish oil+probiotics group had higher levels of IFNα2 compared to the fish oil+placebo group, these differences were not statistically significant after correction for multiple testing. Multivariate linear model revealed significant associations between several immune mediators and the perinatal use of medication. CONCLUSION: Fish oil/probiotics intervention exerted a minor effect on concentrations of colostrum immune mediators. However, medication during the perinatal period modulated the immune mediators. These changes in colostrum's composition may contribute to immune system development in the infant.",

Heifers were individually-fed chopped poor quality hay and supplemented to meet targeted nutritional planes based on estimated hay intakes. Dam BW, BCS, backfat, and metabolic status were determined pre-treatment, every 21 d (BW and metabolic status) or 42 d (BCS and backfat) during gestation, and post-calving. At birth, calf BW and size were measured, and total colostrum from the most full rear quarter was collected pre-suckling. Data were analyzed with nutritional plane, treatment initiation date, and calf sex (when P < 0.25) as fixed effects. Gestational metabolites included day and nutritional plane × day as repeated measures. During late gestation, CON dams gained (P < 0.01) maternal (non-gravid) BW and maintained (P ≥ 0.17) BCS and backfat, while NR dams lost (P < 0.01) maternal BW, BCS, and backfat. Circulating glucose, urea N, and triglycerides were less (P ≤ 0.05) in NR dams than CON at most late gestational timepoints after treatment initiation. Circulating non-esterified fatty acids were greater (P < 0.01) in NR dams than CON. Post-calving, NR dams weighed 63.6 kg less (P < 0.01) and were 2.0 BCS less (P < 0.01) than CON. At 1 h post-calving, NR dams had less (P = 0.01) plasma glucose and tended to have less (P = 0.08) plasma triglycerides than CON. Nutrient restriction did not affect (P ≥ 0.27) gestation length, calf birth weight, or calf size at birth. Colostrum yield was 40% less (P = 0.04) in NR dams than CON. Protein and immunoglobulin concentrations were greater (P ≤ 0.04), but free glucose and urea N concentrations were less (P ≤ 0.03), in colostrum of NR dams than CON. Colostrum total lactose, free glucose, and urea N were less (P ≤ 0.03) in NR dams than CON, but total protein, triglycerides, and immunoglobulins were not affected (P ≥ 0.55). In summary, beef heifers experiencing late gestational nutrient restriction prioritized partitioning nutrients to fetal growth and colostrum production over maternal growth. During undernutrition, fetal and colostral nutrient demands were largely compensated for by catabolism of maternal tissue stores.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preterm complications are now the second leading cause of death in children under five years of age. Colostrum is essential to prevent infection and promote maturation in preterm infants. Guidelines recommend that preterm infants be fed colostrum by the oral and pharyngeal routes as early as possible after birth to provide immune protection; however, due to disease and an uncoordinated sucking and swallowing function, it is challenging to provide colostrum through the oropharyngeal route, which limits the immune protection it provides. OBJECTIVE: To update the existing meta-analysis, evaluate the effect of oropharyngeal colostrum administration on related outcomes in preterm infants and explore the optimal frequency and duration of oropharyngeal colostrum administration through subgroup analysis. METHODS: The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Ovid databases were searched for randomized control trials (RCTs) of oropharyngeal colostrum administration for preterm infants. Two researchers screened the literature strictly according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria and evaluated the quality. Primary data and data from the included literature were extracted. Finally, the data were statistically analyzed by the Review Manager 5.3 software. RESULTS: A total of 1736 preterm infants were included in 16 RCTs. The meta-analysis showed that the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis, late-onset sepsis, feeding intolerance, and death was lower, the time to full enteral feeding was shorter, and the day of recovery to birth weight was earlier in the intervention group (oropharyngeal colostrum administration group) than in the control group, and this difference was statistically significant. Subgroup analysis: Frequency of oropharyngeal colostrum administration: The incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and late-onset sepsis in the once every 4 h group was lower than that in the control group, and the time to complete enteral feeding was shorter. Duration of oropharyngeal colostrum administration: In the 1-3 days group and 4-7 days group, the time to full enteral feeding in the intervention group was shorter. In the 8-10 days group, the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and late-onset sepsis was lower in the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: Oropharyngeal colostrum administration can reduce the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis, late-onset sepsis, feeding intolerance and mortality, shorten the time to full enteral feeding, and lead to a faster recovery to birth weight in preterm infants. The appropriate oropharyngeal colostrum administration frequency may be 4 h, and the optimal duration may be 8-10 days. Therefore, it is recommended that clinical medical staff implement oropharyngeal colostrum administration for premature infants based on existing evidence.

Insulin was supplemented to approximately 5× (70.0 μg/L; n = 16) or 10× (149.7 μg/L; n = 16) the basal colostrum insulin (12.9 μg/L; BI, n = 16) concentration to maintain equivalent macronutrient intake (crude fat: 4.1 ± 0.06%; crude protein: 11.7 ± 0.05%; and lactose: 1.9 ± 0.01%) among treatments. Colostrum was fed at 2, 14, and 26 h postnatal and blood metabolites and insulin concentration were measured at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 360, 480, and 600 min postprandial respective to the first and second colostrum meal. At 30 h postnatal, a subset of calves (n = 8/treatment) were killed to excise the gastrointestinal and visceral tissues. Gastrointestinal and visceral gross morphology and dry matter and small intestinal histomorphology, gene expression, and carbohydrase activity were assessed. Insulin supplementation tended to linearly reduce the glucose clearance rate following the first meal, whereas after the second meal, supplementation linearly increased the rate of glucose absorption and nonesterified fatty acid clearance rate, decreased the time to maximum glucose concentrations, and decreased the time to reach minimum nonesterified fatty acid concentrations. Additionally, insulin clearance rate was linearly increased by insulin supplementation following the second colostrum feeding. However, there were no overall differences between treatments in the concentrations of glucose, nonesterified fatty acids, or insulin in plasma or serum. With respect to macroscopic intestinal development, dry rumen tissue mass linearly decreased when insulin was supplemented in colostrum, and supplementation linearly increased duodenal dry tissue density (g dry matter/cm) while tending to increase duodenal dry tissue weight. Increasing the colostrum insulin concentration improved small intestinal histomorphological development in the distal small intestine, as ileal villi height and mucosal-serosal surface area index were increased by supplementing insulin. Lactase enzymatic activity linearly increased in the proximal jejunum while ileal isomaltase activity linearly decreased with insulin supplementation. These data indicate that changes in colostrum insulin concentrations rapidly affect gastrointestinal growth prioritization and carbohydrase activity. The changes in gastrointestinal ontology result in minor changes in postprandial metabolite availability and clearance.",

Few studies report on milk protein hydrolysates' XO inhibitory activity, with the mechanism of their interaction remaining elusive. Here, different commercial enzymes were used to hydrolyze α-lactalbumin and bovine colostrum casein. The two proteins hydrolyzed by alkaline protease exhibited the most potent XO inhibitory activity (bovine casein: IC50 = 0.13 mg mL-1; α-lactalbumin: IC50 = 0.28 mg mL-1). Eight potential XO inhibitory peptides including VYPFPGPI, GPVRGPFPIIV, VYPFPGPIPN, VYPFPGPIHN, QLKRFSFRSFIWR, LVYPFPGPIHN, AVFPSIVGR, and GFININSLR (IC50 of 4.67-8.02 mM) were purified and identified from alkaline protease hydrolysates by using gel filtration, LC-MS/MS and PeptideRanker. The most important role of inhibiting activity of peptides is linked to hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding based on the results of molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation. The enzymatic hydrolysate of α-lactalbumin and bovine colostrum casein could be a competitive candidates for hyperuricemia-resisting functional food.",

Human milk influences body health, growth, and development related to the presence of micro and macro nutrient components. This study assessed the effects of human colostrum as a storage medium on the success of tooth replantation. METHODS: The upper left incisor of 30 adult male Wistar rats was extracted, and the rats were divided into three groups according to the storage medium of the extracted tooth for replantation: Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), tap water, and colostrum groups. The MTT cell viability assay was conducted, and histological evaluation and histomorphometric analyses were performed on postoperative day 45 for identification of pulp necrosis, periodontal hyalinization, percentage of resorbed area, and the periodontal ligament attachment. RESULTS: The colostrum medium showed a higher percentage of cell viability followed by HBSS with statistical significance. Histological findings of the replanted avulsed tooth that soaked in tap water as storage medium showed obvious external and internal root resorption. Pulp necrosis and periodontal ligament hyalinization and with a significant differences values in comparison to HBSS and colostrum groups (p > 0.05), whereas the colostrum group showed new well-reattached periodontal ligament with normal pulp and no evidence of root resorption. CONCLUSION: Tooth loss is minimized by using human colostrum as storage medium in replantation of an avulsed tooth after a 1 h period compared to HBSS and water."

A majority of the reported investigations were performed with native bovine or recombinant human LF, applied alone or in combination with probiotics, as nutraceutics and diet supplements. Apart from reducing adverse side effects of the applied therapeutics, BC and LF augmented their efficacy and improved the wellness of patients. In conclusion, LF and complete native colostrum, preferably administered with probiotic bacteria, are highly recommended for inclusion in therapeutic protocols in NSAIDs and corticosteroid anti-inflammatory, as well as antibiotic, therapies. These colostrum-based products can also be of value for individuals subjected to prolonged psychophysical stress (mediated by endogenous corticosteroids), especially at high ambient temperatures (soldiers and emergency services), as well as physically active people and training athletes. They are also recommended for patients during recovery from trauma and surgery, which are always associated with severe psychophysical stress."

In experiment 1, composite colostrum samples were harvested from individual cows (n = 14) on a commercial dairy farm in NY and split into 3 aliquots using single-use colostrum bags. One aliquot was immediately cooled on ice following harvest (RAW) and stored at 4°C overnight, one was heat-treated for 60 min at 60°C (HT) before being cooled on ice and stored at 4°C overnight, and one was frozen at -20°C overnight (FR). The following morning, all samples were warmed to 40°C before further processing. In experiment 2, cows were sampled in a longitudinal study where composite samples were collected from colostrum (first milking, n = 23), transition milk (3 to 4 d postpartum, n = 13), and mature milk (6 to 7 d postpartum, n = 13). In both experiments colostrum was harvested from the first milking within 8 h of calving and samples were processed within 14 h of collection. Colostral leukocytes were isolated before viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion and manual differential cell counts were performed. Extracellular vesicles were isolated from whey by ultracentrifugation to isolate and quantify microRNA. Activity of the alternative complement pathway was determined in casein-depleted whey by semi-solid phase hemolysis assay. Somatic cell counts were determined for all raw samples. Macrophages and neutrophils made up the greatest proportion of leukocytes in colostrum followed by lymphocytes. Lymphocyte proportion increased as colostrum transitioned to mature milk, but overall somatic cell numbers declined concurrently. Viable cells were not isolated from HT or FR samples. Abundance of microRNA isolated from transition and mature milk was decreased compared with colostrum, did not differ between HT and RAW, but was increased in FR compared with RAW. Alternative complement pathway activity was decreased in HT, but not FR compared with RAW, and was not measurable in transition or mature milk. Postharvest heat-treatment and freezing of colostrum eliminated viable colostral leukocytes and affected microRNA abundance and complement activity. Leukocyte proportions, microRNA abundance, and complement activity changed as colostrum transitioned to mature milk. Although there were clear changes in the colostral components under study in relation to treatment and transition to mature milk, the biological significance of the described treatment effects and temporal changes were not investigated here.",

      "abstract": "Newborn ruminants depend on colostrum intake immediately after birth to obtain immunoglobulins for effective transfer of passive immunity (TPI). As colostrum may also be a vehicle of infectious agents, heat treatment of raw colostrum is a practice aimed at eliminating or reducing its pathogen load. Despite the usefulness of heat treatment in preventing the transmission of infectious colostrum-borne diseases, heat treatment of colostrum may have some side effects. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to summarize the effects of colostrum heat treatment on colostral viscosity and IgG concentration, and serum IgG concentration as a proxy for TPI in newborn calves fed raw versus heat-treated colostrum. Moderators were studied to identify sources of heterogeneity. Literature databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles published between 1946 and 2022. A Master of Science thesis was also included. Five, 21, and 19 original publications were quantitatively evaluated in 3 separate meta-analyses, based on predefined selection criteria. Two-level and 3-level random-effects meta-analysis revealed a significant overall effect of heat treatment on colostral viscosity and IgG concentration, and serum IgG concentration in newborns. Heat-treated colostrum had significantly higher viscosity (21.0 cP, 95% CI: 3.8 to 38.2) and lower IgG concentration (-7.4 g/L, 95% CI: -11.1 to -3.7) compared with raw colostrum. Overall, newborn calves fed heat-treated colostrum had higher serum IgG concentrations (2.8 g/L, 95% CI: 1.4 to 4.0) 24-48 h after birth than those fed with raw colostrum. Particularly, this positive effect on the serum IgG concentrations was seen when colostrum was heat-treated at ≤60°C (2.9 g/L, 95% CI: 0.9 to 4.2) and when the standard low-temperature low-time (LTLT) method was used for heat treatment (2.6 g/L, 95% CI: 0.1 to 5.1). Colostrum treated at >60-63.5°C tended to have higher viscosity (275.6 cP, 95% CI: -37.9 to 589.3) and had lower IgG concentration (-21.7 g/L, 95% CI: -27.3 to -16.1). Calves fed colostrum treated at this temperature range had significantly lower serum IgG (-4.2 g/L, 95% CI: -7.9 to -0.4) compared with those fed raw colostrum. Heat treatment of colostrum at 72-76°C was not associated with a significant increase in colostral viscosity (6.3 cP, 95% CI: -324.3 to 336.9) nor a reduction in IgG colostral concentration (-13.1 g/L, 95% CI: -26.5 to 0.2), but calves fed colostrum treated at this temperature range had a significant reduction in serum IgG (-11.3 g/L, 95% CI: -17.1 to -5.4). Feeding newborn calves with colostrum heat-treated at ≤60°C by the standard LTLT method, particularly within 2 h after birth, resulted in increased serum IgG concentration at 24-48 h of age. Importantly, delaying feeding of heat-treated colostrum to newborns beyond 2 h of age resulted in no significant difference in IgG serum levels compared with feeding raw colostrum, highlighting the importance of early administration of heat-treated colostrum to favor TPI. On-farm colostrum heat treating should achieve an equilibrium between pathogen elimination and the preservation of colostral immunoglobulins while minimizing undesired increases in viscosity. The beneficial effects of colostrum heat treatment on TPI can be negligible if colostrum feeding is not performed within 2 h after birth.",

Colostrum is a natural product with anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. METHODS: UC was induced in 37 Sprague Dawley rats by administration of a 2 mL enema of 3% acetic acid (AA). The control groups received no treatment during the study, while the experimental groups received either oral or rectal administration of 100 mg/kg 5-aminosalicylic acid, or oral or rectal administration of 300 mg/kg of colostrum. Histopathological and serological analyses were performed 7 days following treatment. RESULTS: A significant decrease in weight was seen in all rats except for the test groups receiving colostrum (P<0.001). After treatment, the level of superoxide dismutase increased more significantly in the test groups that received colostrum (P<0.05). All test groups had a reduction in C-reactive protein and white blood cell levels. The colostrum test groups also showed a decrease in inflammation rate, ulceration, destruction, disorganization, and crypt abscess of the colonic mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study show that the administration of colostrum can improve the pathological changes of the intestinal mucosa, as well as inflammatory responses, in animal models of UC. Further studies at both preclinical and clinical levels are suggested to confirm these findings."

Four key drivers included: optimizing evidence-based OIT guidelines, personnel alignment and engagement, optimal electronic health record use for ordering practices, and timely lactation consultant involvement. The primary outcome measure was early OIT administration, whereas secondary outcome measures examined all OIT administration and human milk at discharge. Process measures included the percentage of staff members who were compliant with OIT protocol. RESULTS: Early OIT administration increased from a baseline mean of 6% to 55% in the 12-month study period. Percentage of total (early and late) OIT administration to VLBW infants increased from a baseline of 21% to 85%. Average human milk at discharge for VLBW infants remained at 44%, without significant improvement.

AIMS: To investigate feasibility, safety and preliminary efficacy on growth and blood biochemistry when using intact bovine colostrum (BC) as a fortifier to human milk in very preterm infants. METHODS: In an open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled pilot trial (infants 26-31 weeks' gestation), mother's own milk or donor human milk was fortified with powdered BC (n = 115) or a conventional fortifier (CF, bovine-milk-based, n = 117) until 35 weeks' postmenstrual age. Fortifiers and additional micronutrients were added to human milk according to local guidelines to achieve optimal growth (additional protein up to +1.4 g protein/100 mL human milk). Anthropometry was recorded weekly. Clinical morbidities including necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and late-onset sepsis (LOS) were recorded. Clinical biochemistry included plasma amino acid (AA) levels to assess protein metabolic responses to the new fortifier. RESULTS: A total of 232 infants, gestational age (GA) 28.5 ± 1.4 (weeks + days), fulfilled inclusion criteria. Birthweight, GA and delta Z scores from birth to end of intervention on weight, length or head circumference did not differ between groups, nor between the subgroups of small for gestational age infants. Likewise, incidence of NEC (BC: 3/115 vs. CF: 5/117, p = 0.72, unadjusted values), LOS (BC: 23/113 vs. CF: 14/116, p = 0.08) and other morbidities did not differ. BC infants received more protein than CF infants (+10%, p < 0.05) and showed several elevated AA levels (+10-40%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Infants fortified with BC showed similar growth but received more protein and showed a moderate increase in plasma AA-levels, compared with CF. Adjustments in protein composition and micronutrients in BC-based fortifiers may be required to fully suit the needs for very preterm infants.",

      "abstract": "Calf diarrhea is a leading cause of death in preweaning calves and it causes major economic losses to producers. Acidified milk has been shown to have beneficial effects on health and growth parameters in calves but there is little research into its effects on the microbiota, and few studies on the use of acidified colostrum. The purpose of this study was to compare how feeding acidified colostrum to calves at birth affects fecal microbiota from birth through 8 wk of age compared with calves fed nonacidified colostrum. In this study, 5 calves received acidified colostrum (treated group) and 5 calves received nonacidified colostrum (control group) at birth and at 12 h of age. All calves were subsequently fed acidified whole milk until weaning at 8 wk of age and had access to starter grain starting at d 3 and throughout the study. Fecal samples were collected at 24 h, 48 h, and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 wk of age. Samples were extracted for genomic DNA, PCR-amplified for the V1-V2 region of the 16S rRNA bacteria gene, sequenced, and analyzed using QIIME2. Bacterial richness (estimated by number of observed species) and bacterial diversity (estimated by Shannon diversity index) differed between time points but not between treatment groups, and both increased over time. Weighted and unweighted UniFrac analysis showed differences between bacterial communities across time points and treatments. Across all time points (lmer test), 6 bacterial genera were different between treatments: Faecalibacterium and unclassified Clostridiaceae were more abundant, whereas Atopobium, Collinsella, CF231, and unclassified Veillonellaceae were less abundant in treated versus control calves. Faecalibacterium is a butyrate-producing bacterium that has been linked to decreased prevalence of diarrhea in calves. Our results indicate that there is considerable flux in the calf microbiome through the neonatal period and weaning transition but that feeding acidified colostrum followed by acidified whole milk allowed early colonization of Faecalibacterium. Further studies are needed to verify the positive benefits of promoting Faecalibacterium on improving the health of preweaning calves."

      "abstract": "Chemotherapeutics continue to play a central role in the treatment of a wide variety of cancers. Conventional chemotherapy involving bolus intravenous doses results in severe side effects - in some cases life threatening - delayed toxicity and compromised quality-of-life. Attempts to deliver small drug molecules using liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, micelles, lipid nanoparticles, etc. have produced limited nanoformulations for clinical use, presumably due to a lack of biocompatibility of the material, costs, toxicity, scalability, and/or lack of effective administration. Naturally occurring small extracellular vesicles, or exosomes, may offer a solution and a viable system for delivering cancer therapeutics. Combined with their inherent trafficking ability and versatility of cargo capacity, exosomes can be engineered to specifically target cancerous cells, thereby minimizing off-target effects, and increasing the efficacy of cancer therapeutics. Exosomal formulations have mitigated the toxic effects of several drugs in murine cancer models. In this article, we review studies related to exosomal delivery of both small molecules and biologics, including siRNA to inhibit specific gene expression, in the pursuit of effective cancer therapeutics. We focus primarily on bovine milk and colostrum exosomes as the cancer therapeutic delivery vehicles based on their high abundance, cost effectiveness, scalability, high drug loading, functionalization of exosomes for targeted delivery, and lack of toxicity. While bovine milk exosomes may provide a new platform for drug delivery, extensive comparison to other nanoformulations and evaluation of long-term toxicity will be required to fully realize its potential.",

Next, somatic cells from colostrum and milk were co-cultured with cells from the ovine third eyelid. After this step, viral titers of the supernatants collected from treatments with greater efficacy in co-culture were assessed. The organic ethyl acetate fractions of both plants at 90 min possibly inhibited the viral activity of CLV by up to a thousandfold in colostrum. In milk, this inhibition was up to 800 times for the respective Meliaceae. In conclusion, the ethanolic fraction of ethyl acetate from both plants demonstrated efficacy against CLV in samples from colostrum and milk when subjected to treatment, which was more effective in colostrum.",

      "abstract": "Acquisition of adequate transfer of passive immunity (ATPI) by calves depends on the absorption of sufficient mass of colostral immunoglobulin G (IgG). Several studies report conflicting evidence regarding the ability of feeding pooled colostrum to achieve ATPI. Pooling colostrum is practical and efficient for some dairies, and recommendations are required to prevent failure of transfer of passive immunity (FTPI) in calves following pooling. This study aimed to determine the effect of pooling colostrum on serum IgG concentrations, FTPI, and preweaning mortality in calves. A prospective study was performed on two conventional Jersey dairy farms where heat treatment of colostrum occurred in the same colostrum processing kitchen. Four to 10 cows contributed to colostrum pools. A sample of the colostrum pool fed to the calves and serum from calves at 24-72 h was collected for IgG concentration determination by single radial immunodiffusion assay. Multivariable and logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate factors that predicated serum IgG concentrations and the probability of FTPI, respectively. A Cox proportional hazard model analysis was performed to determine risk factors for mortality over the preweaning period. A total of 164 calves fed 28 colostrum pools were enrolled. Birth weight, number of colostrum feedings and pool IgG concentrations were significant predictors of calf serum IgG concentrations at 24-72 h, whereas the number of colostrum feedings and age at bleeding to determine passive transfer status were not significant predictors of calf serum IgG concentrations at 24-72 h. The prevalence of FTPI was 4.9%. Birth weight, pool IgG concentrations, number of colostrum feedings, and age at bleeding to check for passive transfer status were not significant predictors of the probability of FTPI at 24-72 h. The incidence of mortality was 4.3%. Passive transfer status was not a predictor of mortality. Our study demonstrates the effect of pooling colostrum on serum IgG concentrations even in herds where colostrum with higher median colostrum IgG concentrations is fed to calves. The results emphasize the recommendations to assess pooled colostrum IgG concentrations before feeding calves."

      "abstract": "Ingestion and absorption of greater quantities of IgG are required to increase serum IgG levels in newborn calves. This could be achieved by adding colostrum replacer (CR) to maternal colostrum (MC). The objective of this study was to investigate whether low and high-quality MC can be enriched with bovine dried CR to achieve adequate serum IgG levels. Male Holstein calves (n = 80; 16/treatment) with birth body weights (BW) of 40 to 52 kg were randomly enrolled to be fed 3.8 L of the following combinations: 30 g/L IgG MC (C1), 60 g/L IgG MC (C2), 90 g/L IgG MC (C3), C1 enriched with 551 g of CR (60 g/L; 30-60CR), or C2 enriched with 620 g of CR (90 g/L: 60-90CR). A subset of 40 calves (8/treatment) had a jugular catheter placed and were fed colostrum containing acetaminophen at a dose of 150 mg/kg of metabolic body weight, to estimate abomasal emptying rate per hour (kABh). Baseline blood samples were taken (0 h), followed by sequential samples at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h relative to initial colostrum feeding. Results for all measurements are presented in the following order, unless otherwise stated: C1, C2, C3, 30-60CR, and 60-90CR. Serum IgG levels at 24 h were different among calves fed C1, C2, C3, 30-60CR, and 60-90CR: 11.8, 24.3, 35.7, 19.9, and 26.9 mg/mL ± 1.02 (mean ± SEM), respectively. Serum IgG at 24 h increased when enriching C1 to 30-60CR, but not from C2 to 60-90CR. Similarly, apparent efficiency of absorption (AEA) values for calves fed C1, C2, C3, 30-60CR, and 60-90CR were different: 42.4, 45.1, 43.2, 36.3, and 33.4% ± 1.93, respectively. Enriching C2 to 60-90CR reduced AEA, and enriching C1 to 30-60CR tended to decrease AEA. The kABh values for C1, C2, C3, 30-60CR, and 60-90CR were also different: 0.16, 0.13, 0.11, 0.09, and 0.09 ± 0.005, respectively. Enriching C1 to 30-60CR or C2 to 60-90CR reduced kABh. However, 30-60CR and 60-90CR have similar kABh compared with a reference colostrum meal (90 g/L IgG, C3). Even though kABh was reduced for 30-60CR, results indicate that C1 has the potential to be enriched and achieve acceptable serum IgG levels at 24 h without affecting AEA.",

METHODS: A total of 1200 neonatal Holstein calves on one commercial dairy farm were enrolled. The calves were divided into heat-treated (60°C for 90 min) and unheated (raw) colostrum groups. Calf serum IgG and total protein concentrations were measured before and after colostrum consumption. Health characteristics and disease prevalence were recorded during the suckling period. RESULTS: Consumption of heat-treated colostrum led to increased serum IgG (P < 0.0001) and total protein (P < 0.0001) concentrations, increased apparent efficacy of IgG absorption (P < 0.0001) and increased general health condition, weight gain (P < 0.0001) and clinical performance. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Heat-treatment of colostrum is an effective method to improve health and increase growth characteristics (weight gain, body size, dry matter intake and feed efficiency rate) of neonatal dairy calves, most likely by decreasing microbial load and facilitating IgG absorption.",

Apart from reducing side effects of the applied therapeutics, radiation and surgical procedures, BC and LF augmented their efficacy and improved the wellness of patients. In conclusion, colostrum and colostrum proteins, preferably administered with probiotic bacteria, are highly recommended for inclusion to therapeutic protocols in cancer chemo- and radiotherapy as well as during the surgical treatment of cancer patients."

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of six months of bovine colostrum supplement intake (3.2 g; four capsules/day) in highly trained female athletes on changes in oxidative stress level, inflammation, and iron metabolism biomarkers after intense exercise. In this study, 20 trained female athletes were recruited. Participants were divided into two groups: 11 in the bovine colostrum (6-month supplementation) and 9 in the placebo group (6-month placebo supplementation). All participants completed an intense exercise test at the beginning of the experiment and after six months post-treatment. Blood samples were taken before, following exercise, and after 3 h recovery. Compared to the placebo group, the colostrum group showed a significant decrease in TBARS level (p< 0.01) at all time points, whereas a marked increase was observed in IL-6 (p < 0.01; pre-exercise) and SOD activity (p < 0.01), and transferrin (p < 0.01; rest period) and lactoferrin (p < 0.05; post-exercise) levels. The results suggested that 6-months of bovine colostrum supplementation is beneficial in the reduction of the harmful effects produced by free radicals (ROS), oxidative stress, and inflammation. In consequence, alleviation of the inflammatory response by bovine colostrum supplementation may also cause positive action on iron homeostasis in female athletes.",

Chemotherapy and radiation treatment are typically associated with severe adverse effects and a decline in patients' quality of life. Anti-cancer substances derived from plants and animals need to be evaluated therapeutically as it is cost-effective, have fewer side effects, and can improve cancer patients' quality of life. Recently, bovine colostrum (BC) has attracted the interest of numerous researchers investigating its anti-cancer potential in humans. Dressings loaded with BC are beneficial in treating chronic wounds and diabetic foot ulcers. Lactoferrin, a glycoprotein with potent anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and anti-microbial effects, is abundant in BC. The BC pills successfully promote the regression of low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia when administered intravaginally. The biological, genetic, and molecular mechanisms driving BC remain to be determined. Oral BC supplements are generally well-tolerated, but some flatulence and nausea may happen. To evaluate the therapeutic effects, long-term safety, and appropriate dosages of BC drugs, well-designed clinical trials are necessary. The purpose of this article is to emphasize the anti-cancer potential of BC and its constituents.",

Milk and colostrum contain high amounts of EVs that could be exploited as alternative natural systems in antimicrobial fighting. The aim of this study is to evaluate cow colostrum-derived EVs (colosEVs) for their antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects in vitro to assess their suitability as natural antimicrobial agents as a strategy to cope with the drug resistance problem. ColosEVs were evaluated on a model of neonatal calf diarrhoea caused by Escherichia coli infection, a livestock disease where antibiotic therapy often has poor results. Colostrum from Piedmontese cows was collected within 24 h of calving and colosEVs were immediately isolated. IPEC-J2 cell line was pre-treated with colosEVs for 48 h and then infected with EPEC/NTEC field strains for 2 h. Bacterial adherence and IPEC-J2 gene expression analysis (RT-qPCR) of CXCL8, DEFB1, DEFB4A, TLR4, TLR5, NFKB1, MYD88, CGAS, RIGI and STING were evaluated. The colosEVs pre-treatment significantly reduced the ability of EPEC/NTEC strains to adhere to cell surfaces (p = 0.006), suggesting a role of ColosEVs in modulating host−pathogen interactions. Moreover, our results showed a significant decrease in TLR5 (p < 0.05), CGAS (p < 0.05) and STING (p < 0.01) gene expression in cells that were pre-treated with ColosEVs and then infected, thus highlighting a potential antimicrobial activity of ColosEVs. This is the first preliminarily study investigating ColosEV immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects on an in vitro model of neonatal calf diarrhoea, showing its potential as a therapeutic and prophylactic tool."

The weight and dry matter intake of ewes during late pregnancy were recorded to calculate the average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR). Twin lambs were weighed on days 0, 7, 14, 30, 60, and 180 after birth to calculate ADG. Meanwhile, the colostrum of ewes was collected within 12 h after delivery. The colostrum MFGM proteins were identified and quantified by the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods. In addition, biological functions of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were annotated by Gene Ontology annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis. The results revealed that a 15.0% CP level had significant effects on the BW of lambs on days 0, 7, and 30 (P < 0.05). Notably, a total of 1,529 MFGM proteins were identified and 286 DEPs were found among three treatments. Functional analysis showed that DEPs were mainly involved in cell growth, differentiation, and tissue repair, and involved in metabolic pathways, such as the porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism pathways. In this study, lambs in HP treatment had better growth performance; moreover, dietary 15.0% CP level also affected the colostrum MFGM proteins composition of Hu ewes. These observations can facilitate future studies on the feeding regimen of ewes during late pregnancy."

      "abstract": "Colostrum consumption is crucial for passive immunization and development of the newborn calf. However, the incidence on failed transfer of passive immunity in male calves destined to dairy-beef production remains high to date. In addition, the lack of an automated procedure to validate the immunization status upon arrival at rearing facilities in calves beyond 14 d of age impedes the identification of failed transfer of passive immunity, and therefore, of those calves at high risk of suffering diseases. For this study, 82 newborn male Holstein calves (43.3 ± 0.86 kg of body weight; mean ± standard error) from a commercial dairy farm were used to investigate potential serum biomarkers of colostrum provision. The potential biomarkers selected were IgG, IgG1, cholesterol, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and total protein (TP). Treatments were as follows: high-colostrum (HC; n = 49), in which calves received 4 L of colostrum within the first 2 h after birth and 2 L of colostrum in the next 3 feedings within the first 24 h after birth, for a total of 10 L of colostrum; and low-colostrum (LC; n = 33), in which calves received only 2 L of colostrum within the first 2 h after birth. After colostrum consumption, calves were allocated to individual hutches and fed 2 L of milk replacer twice daily at a concentration of 125 g/L as fed. Starter feed and water were offered ad libitum. At approximately 14 d of age (14.2 ± 0.81 d of age; mean ± standard error) calves were transported 2.5 h to a research unit at IRTA (Torre Marimon, Spain) simulating the arrival to a rearing facility. Blood samples were collected before feeding at birth, 48 h after birth, and at arrival to the rearing facility. Results on the serum concentrations of the potential biomarkers at arrival to the rearing facility showed that IgG, IgG1, GGT, and TP were greater for the HC calves compared with the LC calves. Serum concentrations of cholesterol and alkaline phosphatase did not show differences between treatment groups. Additionally, body weight losses from birth until arrival to the rearing facility were greater for the LC treatment compared with the HC. Because of their low cost, quickness, and ease of measurement, GGT and TP were good indicators of colostrum intake in calves arriving at rearing facilities beyond 14 d of age.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the effect of colostrum feeding time on the colon digesta microbiome of 2-day-old dairy calves using whole-genome-based metagenome sequencing, aiming to understand the dynamic changes of the colon microbiome when the colostrum feeding is delayed. In total, 24 male Holstein calves were grouped to different pasteurized colostrum feeding time treatments randomly: TRT0h (45 min after birth, n = 7); TRT6h (6 h after birth, n = 8); and TRT12h (12 h after birth, n = 9). Bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, and viruses were identified in the colon microbiome, with bacteria (99.20%) being the most predominant domain. Streptococcus, Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus, and Enterococcus were the top five abundant bacteria genera. For colon microbiome functions, 114 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were identified, with nutrients metabolism-related functions \"carbohydrate metabolism,\" \"amino acid metabolism,\" \"metabolism of cofactors and vitamins,\" \"metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides,\" and \"metabolism of other amino acids\" being the top five secondary level of KEGG hierarchy functions. When colon microbiomes were compared, they were not affected by delaying first colostrum feeding at both taxonomic and functional levels. However, distinct clusters of colon microbiome profiles were shown based on PERMANOVA analysis despite of different colostrum feeding treatment, suggesting the individualized responses. Moreover, the relative abundance of microbial taxa, microbial functions, and differentially expressed genes was compared between the two distinct clusters, and different relationships were observed among host differentially expressed genes, differential levels of microbial taxa, and microbial functions between the two clusters. Our results suggest that the host may play an important role in shaping the colon microbiome of neonatal dairy calves in response to the early life feeding management. Whether the observed colon microbiome shifts affect gut health and function in the long term requires further research."

      "abstract": "Background: The microbial community in human milk is associated with many maternal and neonatal factors. This study aimed to investigate the effect of antibiotic exposure on the microbial community structure of colostrum. Methods: Twenty women with antibiotic treatment immediately after delivery and 10 age-matched control women were enrolled at the Guangdong Women and Children Hospital. Colostrum samples were collected within postpartum 30 hours. The V4 variable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was sequenced to characterize the microbial profile using Illumina MiSeq platform. Results: Phyla Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were the predominant bacteria in colostrum samples. The core and abundant genera in colostrum included Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Pseudomonas. Compared with the control group, principal coordinate analysis based on the Bray-Curtis distance showed a significant difference in milk microbial community in women with antibiotic exposure, accompanied by a significantly lower alpha diversity and a different microbial ecological network. Furthermore, the relative abundances of genera Actinomyces, Anaerobacter, and Clostridium_sensu_stricto significantly decreased after antibiotic treatment. Conclusions: This study provided evidence of alterations in the colostrum microbial community with antibiotic exposure, improving our understanding of the effects of antibiotic treatment on the milk microbiome.",
