      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Current strategies for treating osteoarthritis (OA) are based on a multimodal approach that includes pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods. Undenatured chicken collagen type II (NK2) is considered safe and effective for maintaining joint health and can be used alone and combined with drugs for OA treatment. AIM: To further evaluate the efficacy of the combination of Artneo containing NK2 in patients with stage III knee OA compared with placebo in a multicenter, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 212 patients from 12 centers in the Russian Federation, of whom 50 had radiological stage III knee OA: 41 (82.0%) females and 9 (18.0%) males aged 44 to 75. Using the interactive web response system (IWRS), the study population was randomized into two groups: Group 1 (Artneo group) included 28 patients receiving the drug 1 capsule once a day for 180 days, Group 2 (placebo group) included 22 patients receiving placebo with drug-matched presentation and the same regimen as in Group 1. The effectiveness of therapy was assessed by the change of pain using the Visual Analog Scale, the WOMAC index, KOOS, the EQ-5D quality of life questionnaire, and the need for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. All patients had a complete blood count, urinalysis, blood chemistry, and ultrasonic examination of the target knee joint. RESULTS: A prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial demonstrated that Artneo containing NK2 was significantly superior to placebo in all studied parameters, improved all clinical manifestations of OA: reduced pain and stiffness, improved joint function and quality of life, and had a good safety profile. CONCLUSION: Artneo showed high efficacy and safety in the general population of patients, including those with stage III knee OA.",

This study aims to improve our understanding of Spondyloepiphyseal Dysplasia Congenita (SEDC) caused by mutations in COL2A1. We also aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy of growth hormone (GH) therapy in two SEDC patients. METHODS: We performed genetic analyses of seven paediatric patients from unrelated Chinese families. Two patients received GH therapy, and their growth trajectories were monitored over 3.5 and 3 years. RESULTS: Genetic screening identified six missense mutations (Gly1110Ser, Gly1107Glu, Gly873Arg, Gly456Ala, Gly1062Ser and Gly1182Arg) and one intron variant in COL2A1. All patients (five girls and two boys, ranging from 2 years and 7 months to 12 years) were diagnosed with SEDC, exhibiting disproportionate short stature and skeletal abnormalities. GH therapy resulted in height increases of 0.76 and 0.27 standard deviation scores over 3.5 and 3 years, respectively, with no significant side effects. CONCLUSION: This study expands the mutation spectrum of COL2A1 and supports the efficacy and safety of GH therapy in SEDC patients, highlighting the need for multi-center studies to further investigate GH's therapeutic potential."

Although type II collagen plays a crucial role in maintaining tissue integrity, the stress-stretch and failure response of type II collagen fibrils in tension is not established in the current mechanics literature. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted tensile tests on isolated collagen networks from articular cartilage and established a validated constitutive model for type II collagen fibril. We identified two distinct failure mechanisms: one without softening before failure and another with pronounced softening. Our findings reveal that network morphology significantly influences the bulk mechanical response, providing a framework for modeling the complex behavior of collagen fibrils in both healthy and diseased tissues. The validated model enhances the accuracy of finite element models used in analyses of soft tissues and may deepen our understanding of the mechanical progression of diseases like osteoarthritis. Our results offer valuable insights into the mechanics of type II collagen, with implications for improving computational models and for guiding future studies in tissue regeneration and disease treatment.",

However, the mechanisms and active compounds of PM remain poorly understood. AIM OF THE STUDY: Chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can affect multiple joints. Inflammation begins in the synovium and spreads to the surrounding cartilage and bone if left untreated. This study assessed the probable anti-arthritic mechanisms of action of PM extracts. Type II collagen emulsion-induced rheumatoid used as an in vivo model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TNF-α-stimulated MC cells were used to investigate the mechanism of PM extract in RA, and the PM extract was confirmed using HPLC analysis. The antiproliferative efficacy of PM was assessed by MTT assay, and apoptotic activity was evaluated using Hoechst staining and flow cytometry assessment. Furthermore, the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) ratio and mRNA expression of Bcl-2, Cas-3, Cas-9, and SOCS1 were determined using ELISA and qRT-PCR. RESULTS: PM extract treatment possesses anti-arthritic properties in CIA rats and can suppress inflammation and inhibit the invasion and migration of MH7A cells. The upregulation of Bcl-2, a recognized inhibitor of apoptotic genes, prevents the release of cyto-C into the cytoplasm. The in vivo outcomes showed that PM reduced the arthritis score and toe swelling in CIA rats. In vitro, PM extract exhibited substantial antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic properties on TNF-α-induced MH7A cell lines. The invasive and adhesive properties of MH7A cells decreased, and MMP secretion was reduced. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the PM extract possesses anti-arthritic properties in the CIA model and is an extension of the clinical treatment of rheumatic arthritis.",

      "abstract": "Immune responses, especially NLRP3 signaling in macrophages, play critical roles in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an autoimmune and inflammatory disease. In this study, we aimed to identify novel therapies for RA. We focused on sophoricoside (SOP), an isoflavone glycoside isolated from Sophora japonica. We predicted the targets of SOP and performed a Gene Ontology analysis to assess its effects. The results suggested that SOP is related to inflammation regulation. We verified these findings by performing in vitro experiments with M1 macrophages differentiated from human peripheral blood monocytes (THP-1 cells). Sophoricoside administration reduced inflammatory activity and NLRP3, Caspase-1, and IL-1β protein levels in macrophages. In addition, SOP and triptolide (TP) was administered intragastrically to male SD rats (n = 40) in a collagen-induced arthritis model. We observed that SOP and TP reduced the inflammatory responses and symptoms of RA. Moreover, unlike TP, SOP showed no liver or kidney toxicity in rats. In conclusion, SOP reduces inflammation in type II collagen-induced arthritis by downregulating NLRP3 signaling and has potential for future clinical applications as an ideal therapy for RA."

      "abstract": "Knee meniscus tearing is a common orthopaedic injury that can heal poorly if left untreated, increasing the risk of post-traumatic Osteoarthritis. Intraarticular injection of human cartilage-derived progenitor cells (CPCs) has been shown to promote meniscus healing after injury. However, the mechanism by which CPCs stimulated this effect was unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine the paracrine effects that CPC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have on native meniscal cells during healing. EVs from human CPCs and marrow-derived stromal cells were isolated via ultracentrifugation. EVs produced by each cell type were quantified, and their sizes were determined via NanoSight. EV protein expression was characterized via western blot. Meniscal fibrochondrocyte cellular metabolic activity (as an indicator of cell viability and proliferation) following treatment with EVs, was quantified using MTT and ATP assays. A 2D wound healing assay was used to determine the effects of treating inner meniscal fibrochondrocytes with EVs in a dose-dependent manner. Gene expression analysis for chondrogenesis genes was performed via RT-qPCR on inner meniscal fibrochondrocytes following treatment with EVs. Our results showed that CPCs produced a wide size range of EVs expressing CD9, CD81, and HSP70. Treatment of inner meniscal fibrochondrocytes with CPC-EVs improved 2D wound healing, in comparison to EVs isolated from marrow-derived stromal cell controls. CPC-EV treatment increased Type II Collagen mRNA expression in inner meniscal fibrochondrocytes. These findings demonstrate that CPC-EVs stimulate chondrogenic matrix production and wound healing in meniscal cells at the optimal dose of 1.0 × 107 particles/mL, significantly outperforming the effects of marrow stromal cell-derived EVs.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Restoring immune tolerance is a promising area of therapy for autoimmune diseases. One method that helps restore immunological tolerance is the approach using tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDCs). In our study, we analyzed the effectiveness of using dendritic cells transfected with DNA constructs encoding IL-10, type II collagen, and CCR9 to induce immune tolerance in an experimental model of arthritis. METHODS: Dendritic cell cultures were obtained from bone marrow cells of Balb/c mice. Dendritic cells (DCs) cultures were transfected with pmaxCCR9, pmaxIL-10, and pmaxCollagen type II by electroporation. The phenotype and functions of DCs were studied using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and flow cytometry. Migration of electroporated DCs was assessed in vitro. Induction of antigen-collagen induced arthritis (ACIA) was carried out according to the protocol in Balb/c mice. DCs were then administered to ACIA mice. The development of arthritis was monitored by measuring paw swelling with a caliper at different time points. The immunological changes were assessed by analyzing the content of antibodies to type II collagen using enzyme immunoassay. Additionally, a histological examination of the joint tissue was conducted, followed by data analysis. THE RESULTS ARE AS FOLLOWS: DCs were obtained, characterized by reduced expression of CD80, CD86, and H-2Db (MHC class I), increased expression of CCR9, as well as producing IL-10 and having migratory activity to thymus cells. Transfected DCs induced T-regulatory cells (T-reg) and increased the intracellular content of IL-10 and TGF-β in CD4+T cells in their co-culture, and also suppressed their proliferative activity in response to antigen. The administration of tolDCs transfected with DNA constructs encoding type II collagen, IL-10, and CCR9 to mice with ACIA demonstrated a reduction in paw swelling, a reduction in the level of antibodies to type II collagen, and a regression of histological changes. CONCLUSION: The study presents an approach by which DCs transfected with DNA constructs encoding epitopes of type II collagen, IL-10 and CCR9 promote the development of antigen-specific tolerance, control inflammation and reduce the severity of experimental arthritis through the studied mechanisms: induction of T-reg, IL-10, TGF-β.",

Repeating exposure to type II collagen induces oral tolerance and inhibits induction of arthritis, a chronic inflammatory joint condition. Although some mechanisms underlying oral tolerance are described, how dysregulation of gut immune networks impacts on inflammation of distant tissues like the joints is unclear. We used undenatured type II collagen in a prophylactic regime -7.33 mg/kg three times/week- to describe the mechanisms associated with protective oral immune-therapy (OIT) in gut and joint during experimental Collagen-Induced Arthritis (CIA). OIT reduced disease incidence to 50%, with reduced expression of IL-17 and IL-22 in the joints of asymptomatic mice. Moreover, whilst the gut tissue of arthritic mice shows substantial damage and activation of tissue-specific immune networks, oral administration of undenatured type II collagen protects against gut pathology in all mice, symptomatic and asymptomatic, rewiring IL-17/IL-22 networks. Furthermore, gut fucosylation and microbiome composition were also modulated. These results corroborate the relevance of the gut-joint axis in arthritis, showing novel regulatory mechanisms linked to therapeutic OIT in joint disease.",

Our aim is to explore possible genetic control of OT in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: RA patients with increased interferon γ production invitro when their isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were cultured with type II bovine collagen α1 chain [α1 (II)] were enrolled in this study and were randomly assigned to the \"Low dose\" type II collagen (CII) group (30 µg/day for 10 weeks, followed by 50 µg/day for 10 weeks, followed by 70 µg/day for 10 weeks) or \"High dose\" CII group (90 µg/day for 10 weeks, followed by 110 µg/day for 10 weeks, followed by 130 µg/day for 10 weeks). Heparinized blood was obtained at baseline and after each of the 10 weeks treatment for analysis of the invitro production of IFNγ by their PBMC stimulated by α1(II) . Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of the responders and non-responders to oral CII was conducted using GeneChip Mapping 10 K 2.0 Array. RESULTS: The SNP A-15,737 was found to associate with the ability of CII to suppress IFNγ production by α1(CII)-stimulated RA PBMC. The potential for SNP A-15,737 to associate with the OT response for patients with another autoimmune disease [OT induced by oral type I bovine collagen (CI) in patients with diffuse cutaneous systemic sclersodid (dsSSc)] was also explored. CONCLUSIONS: The ROT1 region plays a role in the control of IFNγ production after oral dosing of auto-antigens, thereby determining if oral tolerance to that antigen will develop.",

AIM: In a multicenter, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study, to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the use of the Artneo complex containing undenatured chicken collagen type II in patients with OA of the knee joints. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study enrolled 212 outpatients from 12 centers in the Russian Federation with knee OA, stages II and III according to the Kellgren-Lawrence classification. The participants included 171 women (80.7%) and 41 men (19.3%), with an average age of 60.2±9.0 years (range: 40 to 75 years). The study population was randomly allocated in equal proportions into two groups using an interactive web response system (IWRS). Group 1 (Artneo) consisted of 106 patients who took one capsule of the drug once daily for 180 days. Group 2 (Placebo) also had 106 patients, with the dosage form and regimen identical to Group 1. During the treatment period, the following outcomes were assessed: WOMAC index, KOOS, pain according to VAS, quality of life using the EQ-5D questionnaire, and the need for NSAIDs. All patients underwent a clinical blood test, general urine analysis, biochemical blood test, and ultrasound examination of the affected knee joint. RESULTS: In a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study, it was demonstrated that the Artneo combination, containing undenatured chicken collagen type II, has a positive effect on all clinical manifestations of OA: it effectively reduces pain, stiffness, and improves the functional state of joints and quality of life. It has a good safety profile and is superior to placebo in all parameters studied. CONCLUSION: The results of the study confirm the good effectiveness and safety of the Artneo combination in patients with OA of the knee joints.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 70 patients with stages I-III of primary knee OA were randomized into 2 groups. Participants in the 1st (n=35) took AN 1 caps/day, in the 2nd (n=35) GC according to the standard regimen. After 7, 30, 90, 180 days, the Lequesne index (severity of OA), pain when moving according to VAS, WOMAC score were assessed, after 1, 3, 6 months - quality of life SF-36 and morning stiffness, after 6 months - MRI with T2 mapping, laboratory safety indicators. RESULTS: Over the course of 6 months of use, an improvement in the WOMAC index and a decrease in pain were observed without intergroup differences, and a greater decrease in stiffness in the AN group. After 3 months, the severity of OA decreased from moderate to mild in the AN group and was significantly lower compared to the GC group; quality of life (physical component of SF-36) was higher in the AN group. After 6 months, there was an improvement in cartilage ultrastructure (T2 relaxation time) in both groups and a more pronounced reduction of the synovitis area (MRI) in the AN group (2.95 and 1.37 times in the AN and GC group, respectively). There were no clinically significant adverse reactions observed in both groups. CONCLUSION: The use of AN in patients with stage I-III primary knee OA was not inferior in efficacy to the combination of GC.

Collagen-based hydrogels have sparked immense interest in cartilage tissue engineering, but substantial challenges persist in developing biocompatible and robust crosslinking strategies, as well as improving their effectiveness against the multifaceted nature of OA. Herein, a novel discovery wherein the simple incorporation of ferrous/ferric ions enables efficient dynamic crosslinking of type II collagen, leading to the development of injectable, self-healing hydrogels with 3D interconnected porous nanostructures, is unveiled. The ferrous/ferric ions crosslinked type II collagen hydrogels demonstrate exceptional physical properties, such as significantly enhanced mechanical strength, minimal swelling ratios, and remarkable resistance to degradation, while also exhibiting extraordinary biocompatibility and bioactivity, effectively promoting cell proliferation, adhesion, and chondrogenic differentiation. Additionally, the hydrogels reveal potent anti-inflammatory effects by upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines while downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. In a rat model of cartilage defects, these hydrogels exhibit impressive efficacy, substantially accelerating cartilage tissue regeneration through enhanced collagen deposition and increased proteoglycan secretion. The innovative discovery of the multifunctional role of ferrous/ferric ions in endowing type II collagen hydrogels with a myriad of beneficial properties presents exciting prospects for developing advanced biomaterials with potential applications in OA.",

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a non-invasive treatment for various proliferative diseases. However, the specific effects of PDT on HO development remain unclear. In this study, the therapeutic potential of a near-infrared (NIR) probe-WL-808, composed of type II collagen-binding peptide (WYRGRL) and a PDT photosensitizer (IR-808), was evaluated for the innovative HO-targeted PDT approach. In vitro studies indicated that WL-808 could induce chondrocyte apoptosis and inhibit cell viability through ROS generation under NIR excitation. In vivo, the efficacy of WL-808-mediated PDT was tested on the tenotomy HO model mice. WL-808 specifically targeted the type II collagen cartilaginous template of HO, promoting cell apoptosis and enhancing extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation under 808 nm NIR excitation, which inhibited the final ectopic bone formation. Moreover, no obvious toxicity or side effects were detected after treatment with WL-808. Taken together, WL-808-mediated PDT significantly diminished ectopic cartilage and subsequent bone formation, providing a new perspective for HO prophylaxis and treatment."

Many animal and clinical trials showed that oral administration of undenatured type II collagen could significantly reduce the incidence of OA or alleviate the symptoms of articular cartilage. Type II collagen is an important component of cartilage matrix. This article reviewed research progress of undenatured type II collagen including its methods of extraction and preparation, structure and characterization, solubility, thermal stability, gastrointestinal digestive stability, its role in improving OA, and the mechanism of its action in improving OA. Type II collagen has been extensively explored for its potential in improving arthritis. Methods of extraction of type II collagen are inefficient and tedious. The method of limited enzymatic hydrolysis is mainly used to prepare soluble undenatured type II collagen (SC II). The solubility, thermal and gastrointestinal digestive stability of SC II are affected by the sources of raw material, pH, salt ions, and temperature. Oral administration of undenatured type II collagen improves OA, whereas its activity is affected by the sources, degree of denaturalization, intervention methods and doses. However, the influence of the structure of undenatured type II collagen on its activity and the mechanism are unclear. The findings in this review support that undenatured type II collagen can be used in the intervention or auxiliary intervention of patients with OA.",

Eight-week-old male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to the following groups: control, sham, ACLT, group A (ACLT + pepsin-soluble collagen type II collagen (C-II) with type I collagen), group B (ACLT + Amano M-soluble C-II with type I collagen), group C (ACLT + high-dose Amano M-soluble C-II with type I collagen), and group D (ACLT + unproteolyzed C-II). Various methods were employed to analyze the knee joint: nociceptive tests, microcomputed tomography, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry. Rats treated with any form of C-II had significant reductions in pain sensitivity and cartilage degradation. Groups that received PSCC-II treatment effectively mitigated the ACLT-induced effects of OA concerning cancellous bone volume, trabecular number, and trabecular separation compared with the ACLT alone group. Furthermore, PSCC-II and unproteolyzed C-II suppressed ACLT-induced effects, such as the downregulation of C-II and upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-13, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-1β. These results indicate that PSCC-II treatment retains the protective effects of traditional undenatured C-II and provide superior benefits for OA management. These benefits encompass pain relief, anti-inflammatory effects, and the protection of cartilage and cancellous bone.",

Conversely, the specific PTMs of the protein (carbamylation, glycosylation, citrullination, oxidative modifications and others) have been implicated in RA autoimmunity. The discovery of the anti-citrullinated protein response in RA, which includes anti-citrullinated COL2 reactivity, has led to the development of improved diagnostic assays and classification criteria for the disease. The induction of immunological tolerance using modified COL2 peptides has been highlighted as a potentially effective strategy for RA therapy. Therefore, the aim of this review is to summarize the recent knowledge on COL2 posttranslational modifications with relevance to RA pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment. The significance of COL2 PTMs as a source of neo-antigens that activate immunity leading to or sustaining RA autoimmunity is discussed.",

      "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that type II collagen (CII) has a potential role in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. However, most of the current studies have used terrestrial animal cartilage as a source of CII extraction, with fewer studies involving marine organisms. Based on this background, collagen (BSCII) was isolated from blue shark (Prionace glauca) cartilage by pepsin hydrolysis and its biochemical properties including protein pattern, total sugar content, microstructure, amino acid composition, spectral characteristics and thermal stability were further investigated in the present study. The SDS-PAGE results confirmed the typical characteristic of CII, comprising three identical α1 chains and its dimeric β chain. BSCII had the fibrous microstructure typical of collagen and an amino acid composition represented by high glycine content. BSCII had the typical UV and FTIR spectral characteristics of collagen. Further analysis revealed that BSCII had a high purity, while its secondary structure comprised 26.98% of β-sheet, 35.60% of β-turn, 37.41% of the random coil and no α-helix. CD spectra showed the triple helical structure of BSCII. The total sugar content, denaturation temperature and melting temperature of BSCII were (4.20 ± 0.03)%, 42 °C and 49 °C, respectively. SEM and AFM images confirmed a fibrillar and porous structure of collagen and denser fibrous bundles formed at higher concentrations. Overall, CII was successfully extracted from blue shark cartilage in the present study, and its molecular structure was intact. Therefore, blue shark cartilage could serve as a potential source for CII extraction with applications in biomedicine.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common degenerative chronic disease accounting for physical pain, tissue stiffness and mobility restriction. Current therapeutic approaches fail to prevent the progression of the disease considering the limited knowledge on OA pathobiology. During OA progression, the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the cartilage is aberrantly remodeled by chondrocytes. Chondrocytes, being the main cell population of the cartilage, participate in cartilage regeneration process. To this end, modern tissue engineering strategies involve the recruitment of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) due to their regenerative capacity as to promote chondrocyte self-regeneration. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the present study, we evaluated the role of type II collagen, as the main matrix macromolecule in the cartilage matrix, to promote chondrogenic differentiation in two MSC in vitro culture systems. The chondrogenic differentiation of human Wharton's jelly- and dental pulp-derived MSCs was investigated over a 24-day culture period on type II collagen coating to improve the binding affinity of MSCs. Functional assays, demonstrated that type II collagen promoted chondrogenic differentiation in both MSCs tested, which was confirmed through gene and protein analysis of major chondrogenic markers. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support that type II collagen contributes as a natural bioscaffold enhancing chondrogenesis in both MSC models, thus enhancing the commitment of MSC-based therapeutic approaches in regenerative medicine to target OA and bring therapy closer to the clinical use.",

      "abstract": "The type II collagen C-terminal pro-peptide is one of the most abundant polypeptides in cartilage. The purpose of this study was to develop a competitive chemiluminescence enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, CALC2, targeting this pro-peptide as a marker of cartilage formation. Technical assay parameters were evaluated. CALC2 level was measured after in vitro cleavage of recombinant type II collagen with bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP-1) and treatment of ex vivo human osteoarthritis (OA) cartilage explant model (HEX) with insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Serum CALC2 levels were assessed in 18 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 19 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and 18 age- and sex-matched controls in cohort 1 and 8 patients with OA and 14 age- and sex-matched controls in cohort 2. Type II collagen cleavage with BMP-1 increased the CALC2 level. IGF-1 treatment increased the CALC2 levels in HEX compared with the untreated explants (p < 0.05). Results were confirmed using Western blot analysis. CALC2 levels were decreased in the patients with RA and AS compared with the healthy controls (p = 0.01 and p = 0.02, respectively). These findings indicate that CALC2 may be a novel biomarker of type II collagen formation. However, further preclinical and clinical studies are required to validate these findings.",

Early treatment is essential for inhibiting the progression of HO but is currently limited by the absence of sensitive and specific early diagnosis. Herein, this study exploits the enrichment of type II collagen (Col2a1) in the HO cartilage formation stage towards developing a near-infrared (NIR) probe for early HO diagnosis, namely WL-808 by conjugating a Col2a1-binding peptide (WYRGRL) and a cyanine dye (IR-808). WL-808 exhibits high specificity for targeting the cartilage in vitro and in vivo with no apparent cytotoxicity. The NIR signal of WL-808 can be detected in the HO cartilage lesions as early as 1 week after injury when micro-CT cannot show any ectopic bone formation. Moreover, the probe is rarely distributed in the normal knee articular cartilage in vivo via the intravenous administration method. Taken together, WL-808 demonstrates great potential in early HO diagnosis under NIR imaging, facilitating early HO prophylaxis and treatment in the clinic.",

      "abstract": "The dominant collagen of the cartilaginous matrix in adults is type II collagen. The amount of type II collagen in the intercellular matrix of cartilage is significantly reduced against the background of musculoskeletal system diseases. The basis of articular cartilage is hyaline cartilage tissue consisting of chondrocytes with tissue-specific antigens that induce the production of antibodies in patients with osteoarthritis (OA). Today, new approaches are being considered in the treatment of OA with the use of udenatured type II collagen (UC-II). Such molecular mechanisms of action of UC-II as the formation of a systemic response through oral tolerance are discussed, since the induction of tolerance is the immune pathway, by default, in the intestine. A number of experimental, preclinical (on volunteers) and clinical studies have shown the effectiveness and safety of the use of UC-II in OA. Standardized extracts of UC-II exhibit anti-inflammatory, immunoregulatory, chondroprotective effects, contributing to the reduction of pain symptoms of OA. Against the background of taking UC-II with induced OA, there is a statistically significant decrease in the level of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL-1β, IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), C-reactive protein (CRP) in serum and the level of max proteinases (MMP-3), nucleated factor «kappa-bi» (NF-κB) in the knee joint. UC-II significantly inhibits the production of prostaglandin E2 (by 20%) and the expression of genes encoding proinflammatory proteins. In experimental models and in OA patients, a decrease in the severity of pain syndrome, an increase in endurance, mobility and an improvement in the functional state of the joints were noted. Clinically, no changes in the structure of the muscle fiber were detected with increased physical exertion. With OA on the background of UC-II (10-40 mg/s), there was a statistically significant decrease in joint pain according to WOMAC. A promising direction of OA therapy is the combination of UC-II with chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine sulfate.",

Intradermal injection of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) loaded with type II collagen (Col II) and rapamycin (LNP-Col II-R) into OA mice effectively induced Col II-specific anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells, substantially increased anti-inflammatory cytokine expression, and reduced inflammatory immune cells and proinflammatory cytokine expression in the joints. Consequently, LNP-Col II-R injection inhibited chondrocyte apoptosis and cartilage matrix degradation and relieved pain, while injection of LNPs loaded with a control peptide and rapamycin did not induce these events. Adoptive transfer of CD4+CD25+ T cells isolated from LNP-Col II-R-injected mice suggested that Tregs induced by LNP-Col II-R injection were likely responsible for the therapeutic effects.

METHODS: CIA rats were treated with MTX (0.25 mg/kg body wt.) and EA (50 mg/kg b.wt.) for a period of 20 days. The effects of treatment in the rats were assessed biochemically by analyzing inflammatory mediators (NF-kB, iNOS, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10) and oxidative stress related parameters (MPO, NO, LPO, catalase, SOD, GSH). In addition, we also assessed the expression of some inflammatory mediators TNF-α, CD8 + though immunohistochemistry in the joint tissue. RESULTS: In the present study, we found expression and synthesis of transcription factor NF-kB was prominent in CIA rats. In addition, main pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and the anti-inflammatory IL-10, was also stand out. Further, reactive oxygen/nitrogen species was also elevated in CIA rats. Treatment with EA ameliorates all the above mentioned inflammatory and oxidative stress related parameters to near normal. Further, we also confirmed the expression of TNF-α, CD8+ T cells through immunohistochemistry was mitigates in joint tissue of EA treated rats. We find EA significantly inhibited the developmental phase of arthritis. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that EA act as potent anti-arthritic and anti-inflammatory agent that could be used as a tool for the development of new drug for the treatment of arthritis.",

Client-owned dogs were enrolled in a clinical, randomized, controlled and prospective study. Posture, lameness, pain, range of motion and x-ray of affected joint(s) were evaluated and scored based on severity (CLINICAL score). The Liverpool Osteoarthritis in Dogs survey was used to score the owner evaluation of dog's mobility (LOAD score and MOBILITY score). Osteoarthritis (OA) stage was defined through the Canine Osteoarthritis Staging tool (COAST). After diagnosis (T0), all patients were randomly assigned to different treatment groups: C group = cimicoxib 2 mg/kg/day orally OS, F group = UC-II® 1 tablet per day OS; C + F group = cimicoxib-UC-II® at the same previous dosages; CTR group = dogs who didn't received any treatment. All treatments were administered for 30 days. Seventy-six dogs completed the study. LOAD score was recorded significant lower after treatment for each group, with a reduction in percentage of 29.5% for C, 31.4% for F, 21.1% for C + F. LOAD score was lower in C(P = 0.04), F(P = 0.001) and C + F(P = 0.009) group at T30 than CTR group. MOBILITY and CLINICAL scores were significantly lower in all groups at T30, when compared to T0. MOBILITY score was lower than CTR in C(P = 0.02) and F(P = 0.01); CLINICAL score was lower in C + F(P = 0.016).

Fifty-four female 12-week-old New Zealand rabbits were classified into three groups: CTR (control-no treatment), CGH (CS + GlHCl + HA) and CGH-NC (CS + GlHCl + HA + NC). Each group was subdivided into three subgroups according to survival times of 24, 56 and 84 days. Over time, all rabbits developed degenerative changes associated with osteoarthritis. CGH-NC showed significantly improved values on macroscopic evaluation, compared to CTR and CGH. Microscopically, significantly better results were seen with CGH and CGH-NC, compared to CTR, and synovial membrane values were significantly better with CGH-NC compared to CGH. A significant improvement in magnetic resonance imaging biomarkers was also observed with CGH-NC in cartilage transversal relaxation time (T2) and subchondral bone D2D fractal dimension in the lateral condyle. In conclusion, our results show beneficial effects on joint health of CGH and CGH-NC and also supports that adding NC to CGH results in even greater efficacy."

Slowing down the progression of OA and diverse locomotive organ disorders is gaining interest in improving the quality of life (QOL) and extending healthy life-span. In a pilot study, intake of a small amount of undenatured type II collagen exhibited suppression of damage to the articular cartilage via oral immune tolerance. It also demonstrated improvement of knee and joint flexibility and mobility with continued intake of undenatured type II collagen (NEXT-II®) derived from chicken sternum cartilage. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical investigation (RCT) evaluated the efficacy and safety of 12 weeks of regular intake of NEXT-II® on joint and motor function in healthy Japanese male and female participants (aged 20 to <75 years). Sixty-four participants were randomized to receive either NEXT-II® (undenatured type II collagen 3.2 mg/d) or placebo over a period of 12 consecutive weeks. Efficacy on joint and motor functions were evaluated measuring knee passive range of motion as the primary outcome; the Japan Knee Osteoarthritis Measure (JKOM), Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for knee discomfort, and motor functions (10-meter walking and stair-climbing test) as the secondary outcomes; and Japan Low back pain Evaluation Questionnaire (JLEQ) and VAS for lower back discomfort as the exploratory outcomes. Fifty-eight participants (placebo = 28; NEXT-II® group = 30) completed the study. In the assessment of knee passive range of motion, significant improvements in \"flexion\" and \"flexible angle (range)\" were observed in the NEXT-II® group at 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. NEXT-II® induced significant improvements in JKOM, VAS for knee and lower back discomfort, 10-meter walking test, stair-climbing test, and JLEQ. Results demonstrate that undenatured type II collagen is safe and efficacious in improving knee flexibility and mobility, reducing knee and lower back pain, and enhancing motor function.",

The current study was assessed the anti-arthritic potential of lupeol and its molecular mechanisms as compared with indomethacin (Indo) in collagen-induced arthritis CIA rats. The rats were randomly alienated into five groups: Control, CIA alone, CIA + lupeol (10 mg/kg bw), CIA + Indomethacin (3 mg/kg bw), and lupeol (10 mg/kg bw) alone. The paw volume, biochemical, hematological parameters, inflammatory enzymes, and cytokines were measured. As well protein expression of apoptotic proteins, and histopathological of ankle joint were examined. Inflammatory markers, cytokines, histological changes, paw volume, and inflammation were intensely reduced and enhanced apoptosis by lupeol. Alterations in hematological parameters, rheumatoid factor, C-reactive protein, and ceruloplasmin in arthritis were reverted by lupeol. Protein expressions of Bcl-2, and P13K/Akt signaling were declined, whereas the Bax, caspssae-3, and caspase-9 were elevated. These results highlighted that lupeol suppresses P13K/Akt signaling and has a promising anti-arthritic potential for collagen-induced rheumatic arthritis treatment. Hence lupeol would be suggested as an alternative natural source with potent anti-inflammatory and apoptotic actions for chronic inflammatory disorders.",

However, the molecular effects on the pathophysiology of knee OA remain unclear. C-terminal telopeptides of type II collagen (CTX-II) is reported to primarily originate from the interface between articular cartilage and subchondral bone, which is a site of potential remodeling in OA. We performed a predefined sub-analysis of the previous study to compare the changes of urinary CTX-II (uCTX-II) in response to IA-HA to those in response to NSAID for knee OA. DESIGN: A total of 200 knee OA patients were registered from 20 hospitals and randomized to receive IA-HA (2,700 kDa HA, 5 times at 1-week intervals) or NSAID (loxoprofen sodium, 180 mg/day) for 5 weeks. The uCTX-II levels were measured before and after treatment. RESULTS: The uCTX-II levels were significantly increased by IA-HA treatment (337.7 ± 193.8 to 370.7 ± 234.8 ng/μmol Cr) and were significantly reduced by NSAID treatment (423.2 ± 257.6 to 370.3 ± 250.9 ng/μmol Cr). The %changes of uCTX-II induced by IA-HA (11.6 ± 29.5%) and NSAID (-9.0 ± 26.7%) was significantly different (between-group difference: 20.6, 95% confidence intervals: 10.6 to 30.6). CONCLUSIONS: While both IA-HA and NSAID improved symptoms of knee OA, uCTX-II levels were increased by IA-HA and reduced by NSAIDs treatment, suggesting these treatments may improve symptoms of knee OA through different modes of action.",

      "abstract": "A major challenge in cartilage tissue engineering (TE) is the development of instructive and biomimetic scaffolds capable of driving effective mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) chondrogenic differentiation and robust de novo matrix formation. Type I collagen-based scaffolds are one of the most commonly selected materials given collagen's intrinsic ability to act as an instructive and active biomaterial. However, the chondrogenic potential of these scaffolds does not offer significant improvement over traditional treatments. We propose that taking a biomimetic approach to scaffold development might lead to an improved outcome for enhanced cartilage repair. Therefore, this study aimed to develop innovative type II collagen (CII)-containing scaffolds for enhanced cartilage repair, by incorporating CII and/or hyaluronic acid (HyA) into a type I collagen (CI) framework. Moreover, focus was placed on understanding the potential synergistic effects played by CII in combination with HyA, in terms of MSC chondrogenesis and cartilage-like formation, when both molecules are incorporated into scaffold biomaterials. The newly developed CII-containing scaffold exhibited a highly porous interconnected structure with 99% porosity and similar mechanical properties to previously optimised collagen-based scaffolds. Although all scaffold variants sustained early cartilaginous matrix deposition, the CII-containing scaffolds in the presence of HyA performed best, offering enhanced deposition and distribution of sulphated glycosaminoglycans (sGAG) in vitro by day 28. Taken together, the combination of CII and HyA resulted in the development of a biomimetic scaffold with improved chondrogenic benefits. These simple \"off-the-shelf\" implants hold great promise to direct enhanced tissue regeneration for the treatment of focal cartilage defects.",

      "abstract": "Treatment of knee osteoarthritis (OA) remains a challenging concern. Preclinical studies provided accumulating evidence on resveratrol efficacy in ameliorating degenerative articular damage. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of resveratrol as monotherapy on the serum level of type II collagen (Coll 2-1) and aggrecan in patients with knee osteoarthritis. The study was an open-labeled noncontrolled clinical trial. Resveratrol 500 mg/day in a single oral dose was given to the patients with knee osteoarthritis for 90 days. The serum levels of Coll-2-1, aggrecan, and biomarkers of inflammation were measured pre- and posttreatment. Hematological profiles and both hepatic and renal function markers were investigated at the baseline and at the end of the treatment for evaluating the tolerability and safety of resveratrol. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) for disease activity were clinically assessed monthly. Administration of 500 mg resveratrol for three months led to a nonsignificant decrease in the serum level of Coll 2-1 while a significant increase in aggrecan serum level. Resveratrol significantly improves pain score measured by VAS and KOOS after 30 days. Improvements in patients' activity and functional status were also evident at day 30 and kept on for three months which was reflected by KOOS subscale scores and with a significant improvement in all KOOS areas. In conclusion, oral administration of resveratrol as a monotherapy provides a remarkable improvement in the clinical status of the patients but has no significant effect on serum levels of Coll 2-1.",

A betegség jelentős fájdalommal jár, progresszív, az ízület strukturális átalakulását és ennek következtében jelentős funkcióvesztést és életminőség-romlást okoz. Kialakulásában immunológiai gyulladásos folyamatok is szerepet játszanak, amelyek befolyásolása lehetőséget ad nemcsak tüneti kezelésre, hanem betegségmódosító terápia kialakítására is.

Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(37): 1481-1484. Summary. Osteoarthritis is a disease of the cartilage, bone and surrounding soft tissues that make up the joints. The disease is associated with significant pain, it is progressive, causing structural transformation of the joint and, as a result, significant loss of function and deterioration in the quality of life. Immunological inflammatory processes also play a role in its development, the influence of which allows not only symptomatic treatment, but also the development of disease-modifying therapy. Oral administration of undenatured type II collagen creates systemic tolerance, which is a new opportunity for immunomodulation by inhibiting proinflammatory processes and enhancing anti-inflammatory effects. Clinical trials have reported significant reduction in pain, improved musculoskeletal function in patients, and the therapy may provide protection against joint damage caused by mechanical stress in healthy joints.

Searching for natural compounds that may suppress the pathological phenotypes of FLSs is important for the development of RA treatment. Tomatidine (Td), a steroidal alkaloid derived from the solanaceae family, has been reported to have anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor and immunomodulatory effects. However, its effect on RA remains unknown. Here, we examined the inhibitory effect of Td on TNFα-induced arthritic FLSs, and subsequently investigated its therapeutic effect on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats. Our results revealed that Td significantly inhibited TNFα-induced proliferation and migration of arthritic FLSs. In addition, we found that Td treatment could efficaciously ameliorate synovial inflammation and joint destruction of rats with CIA. Both in vitro and in vivo studies showed that Td significantly suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα, and downregulated the expression of MMP-9 and RANKL. Further molecular mechanism studies revealed that the inhibitory effect of Td on RA might attribute to the decreased activations of MAPKs (ERK and JNK) and NF-κB. These findings provide evidence that Td has the potential to be developed into a complementary or alternative agent for RA therapy."

      "abstract": "The tissue engineering approach in osteoarthritic cell therapy often requires the delivery of a substantially high cell number due to the low engraftment efficiency as a result of low affinity binding of implanted cells to the targeted tissue. A modification towards the cell membrane that provides specific epitope for antibody binding to a target tissue may be a plausible solution to increase engraftment. In this study, we intercalated palmitated protein G (PPG) with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and antibody, and evaluated their effects on the properties of MSCs either in monolayer state or in a 3D culture state (gelatin microsphere, GM). Bone marrow MSCs were intercalated with PPG (PPG-MSCs), followed by coating with type II collagen antibody (PPG-MSC-Ab). The effect of PPG and antibody conjugation on the MSC proliferation and multilineage differentiation capabilities both in monolayer and GM cultures was evaluated. PPG did not affect MSC proliferation and differentiation either in monolayer or 3D culture. The PPG-MSCs were successfully conjugated with the type II collagen antibody. Both PPG-MSCs with and without antibody conjugation did not alter MSC proliferation, stemness, and the collagen, aggrecan, and sGAG expression profiles. Assessment of the osteochondral defect explant revealed that the PPG-MSC-Ab micromass was able to attach within 48 h onto the osteochondral surface. Antibody-conjugated MSCs in GM culture is a potential method for targeted delivery of MSCs in future therapy of cartilage defects and osteoarthritis."

The present study describes the development of a specific and robust assay measuring type II collagen degradation (T2CM) and discusses its potential as a noninvasive translational biomarker. METHODS: A type II collagen specific neoepitope (T2CM) was identified by mass spectrometry and monoclonal antibodies were raised towards the epitope, employed in a chemiluminescence immunoassay. T2CM was assessed in bovine cartilage explants with or without MMP-13 inhibitor, and explant supernatants were analyzed by Western blot. T2CM was measured in plasma samples from one study (n ​= ​48 patients) where OA patients were referred to total knee replacement (TKR). Additionally, T2CM was quantified in serum from OA patients receiving salmon calcitonin treatment (sCT) (n ​= ​50) compared to placebo (n ​= ​57). RESULTS: The T2CM assay was technically robust (13/4 ​% inter/intra-variation) and specific for the type II collagen fragment cleaved by MMP-1 and -13. The MMP-13 inhibitor reduced the T2CM release from bovine cartilage explants receiving catabolic treatment. These results were confirmed by Western blot. In human end-stage OA patients (scheduled for TKR), the T2CM levels were elevated compared to moderate OA (p<0.004). The OA patients receiving sCT had lower levels of T2CM compared to placebo group after 1, 6, and 24 months of treatment (p ​= ​0.0285, p ​= ​0.0484, p ​= ​0.0035). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, T2CM is the first technically robust serological biomarker assay which has shown biological relevance in ex vivo models and OA cohorts. This suggests that T2CM may have potential as a translational biomarker for cartilage degradation."

Although Q-1 is known to be a coumarin derivative, its structure has not been deposited in the ACX library. Our previous study showed that Q-1 inhibits the activity of inflammatory cells. This study explores the efficacy of Q-1 in regulating rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The findings show that Q-1 acts through the NF-κB signaling pathway. METHODS: The effects of Q-1 were explored using a bovine type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model. The CIA rats were intragastrically administered with high (30 mg·kg-1) or low (15 mg·kg-1) doses of Q-1. The control group was administered with an equal volume of drinking water, while the positive control group was administered with Tripterygium glycoside (9.45 mg·kg-1) for 28 consecutive days. The arthritis indices and ankle joint swelling rates were determined. The levels of IL-1β, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in serum and sialic acid (SA) in liver homogenate were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The pathological features of the ankle joint were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. The IκB, P-IκB, P65, and P-P65 protein levels in synovial tissue were assayed by western blotting. RESULTS: The arthritis index, ankle joint swelling rate, IL-1β, IL-6, and MCP-1 levels in serum, SA level in liver tissue, and IκB, P-IκB, P65, and P-P65 protein levels in synovial tissues were significantly higher (P < 0.01) in the CIA model compared to the control group. RA was successfully replicated by the CIA model, as shown by the joint swelling results and histopathological sections of the ankle. Notably, all the above indicators decreased significantly (P < 0.01) after treatment with Q-1 compared to the model. In addition, animals treated with Q-1 showed lower inflammation in the ankle joints than the model rats. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that Q-1 effectively inhibited RA in rats by downregulating IκB, P-IκB, P65, and P-P65, inhibiting the excessive release of inflammatory factors, and inhibiting the overactivation of the NF-κB signaling pathway."

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common joint disease that ultimately causes physical disability and imposes an economic burden on society. Cartilage destruction plays a key role in the development of OA. Vorinostat is an oral histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor and has been used for the treatment of T-cell lymphoma. Previous studies have reported the anti-inflammatory effect of HDAC inhibitors in both in vivo and in vitro models. However, it is unknown whether vorinostat exerts a protective effect in OA. In this study, our results demonstrate that treatment with vorinostat prevents interleukin 1α (IL-1α)-induced reduction of type II collagen at both gene and protein levels. Treatment with vorinostat reduced the IL-1α-induced production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) in T/C-28a2 cells. Additionally, vorinostat rescued the IL-1α-induced decrease in the expression of the collagen type II a1 (Col2a1) gene and the expression of Sry-related HMG box 9 (SOX-9). Importantly, we found that vorinostat inhibited the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), which is responsible for the degradation of type II collagen. Furthermore, vorinostat suppressed the expression of E74-like factor 3 (ELF3), which is a key transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in the IL-1α-induced reduction of type II collagen. Also, the overexpression of ELF3 abolished the protective effects of vorinostat against IL-1α-induced loss of type 2 collagen by inhibiting the expression of SOX-9 whilst increasing the expression of MMP-13. In conclusion, our findings suggest that vorinostat might prevent cartilage destruction by rescuing the reduction of type II collagen, mediated by the suppression of ELF3.",

      "abstract": "Fractures are the most common large-organ, traumatic injury in humans. The fracture healing stage includes the inflammatory stage (0-5d), cartilage callus stage (5-14d) and hard callus stage (14-21d). All mice underwent open tibial fracture surgery and were treated with saline, Glu or SCII for 21d. Calluses were harvested 5d, 10d and 21d after fracture. Compared with the model group, SCII significantly decreased TNF-α and increased aggrecan serum levels by 5d. H&E results showed that fibrous calluses were already formed in the SCII group and that chondrocytes had begun to proliferate. By 10d, the chondrocytes in the SCII group became hypertrophic and mineralized, and the serum TGF-β and Col-Iα levels were significantly increased, which indicated that the mice with SCII treatment rapidly passed the cartilage repair period and new bone formation was accelerated. Skeletal muscle repaired bones through muscle paracrine factors. IGF-1 and irisin are the two major secretory cytokines. The results showed that the content of muscle homogenate IGF-1 in the SCII group reached the peak at 10d, followed by the up-regulation of Ihh, Patched, Gli1 and Col10α in the callus through the bone surface receptor IGF-1R. Besides, SCII also significantly elevated the muscle irisin level (10 and 21d), and then increased Wnt10b, LRP5, β-catenin and Runx2 expression in the callus by receptor αVβ5. These results suggest that SCII can accelerate the process of endochondral osteogenesis and promote fracture healing through activating the Ihh/PThrp and Wnt/β-catenin pathways by regulating muscle paracrine factors. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effect of marine-derived collagen on fracture healing. This study may provide a theoretical basis for the high-value application of the laryngeal cartilage of squid in the future.",

      "abstract": "The proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM), such as type II collagen in chondrocytes, plays an important role in the development of osteoarthritis (OA). Telmisartan, an angiotensin II (Ang-II) receptor blocker, is a licensed drug used for the treatment of hypertension. However, the effects of Telmisartan in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced damage to chondrocytes and the progression of OA are unknown. In this study, we found that treatment with Telmisartan attenuated TNF-α-induced oxidative stress by reducing the levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the production of protein carbonyl in human C28/I2 chondrocytes. Interestingly, Telmisartan inhibited TNF-α-induced expression and secretions of proinflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1). Notably, stimulation with TNF-α reduced the levels of type II collagen at both the mRNA and the protein levels, which was rescued by the treatment with Telmisartan. Mechanistically, we found that Telmisartan restored TNF-α-induced reduction of SOX-9. Silencing of SOX-9 blocked the inhibitory effects of Telmisartan against TNF-α-induced degradation of type II collagen. These findings suggest that Telmisartan might be a potential and promising agent for the treatment of OA."

In our previous work, we confirmed the anti-inflammatory effects of LC and GST against LPS-induced inflammation in vitro. In this study, LC and GST were fermented and their effects were assessed in an animal model of RA. Both LC and fermented GST (fGST) treatment reduced mice serum nitrite and total cholesterol and triggered myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. In addition, both LC and fGST reduced inflammation-related serum biomarkers such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, and IL-1β. As per the morphological analysis, both LC and fGST protected hind paw joints against RA, and its related mRNA markers improved. Finally, arthritis scores were measured as an indicator of RA of the whole experimental period; the scores suggested that both LC and fGST protect against collagen-induced RA-related inflammation in a mouse model."

Articular cartilage has type II collagen (CII), which is a potent autoantigen protein in arthritis. There has not been much research on the clinical importance of CII-associated diseases. Moreover, the capability of CII to induce immune tolerance has not been previously assessed. We reported that delivery of CII either directly into the eye or via intravenous injection of CII-specific ACAID antigen presenting cells (APCs) can induce ACAID. Here, we hypothesized that peripheral tolerance can be induced following adoptive transfer of in vitro generated CII-specific ACAID B cells to naive mice. Delayed hypersensitivity (DTH) assays were used to assess the suppressive ability of adoptively transferred B cells. Immune responses of ACAID B cell-injected mice were significantly suppressed following challenges with CII as compared to positive controls. This effect was replicated in three different strains of mice (C57BL/6, BALB/c, and DBA/1). Thus, CII-specific ACAID B cells were able to induce immune tolerance in Th1-skewed, Th2-skewed, and arthritis-prone mice. ACAID B cell-mediated tolerance induced by CII could have therapeutic implications for the treatment of CII-mediated autoimmune diseases.",

METHODS: A randomized controlled trial, in which participants were randomly allocated into 2 groups, receiving injections of either hyaluronic acid or dextrose prolotherapy. The hyaluronic acid group received 5 injections, 1 each on weeks 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, and the dextrose prolotherapy group received 3 injections, 1 each on weeks 1, 5 and 9. Serum cartilage oligomeric proteinase, urinary C-terminal telopeptide of type II collagen, Western Ontario McMaster Universities Index score, and numerical rating scale score for pain were measured at baseline and 3 weeks after the last injection. Comparative analysis was conducted using Wilcoxon test within groups and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) test between groups. RESULTS: A total of 47 participants (21 allocated to hyaluronic acid, 26 allocated to dextrose prolotherapy) completed the protocol. Both interventions resulted in significant improvements in numerical rating scale scores for pain, total Western Ontario McMaster Universities Index scores, and its subscales score. However, the dextrose prolotherapy outperformed hyaluronic acid in numerical rating scale score for pain and level of urinary C-terminal telopeptide of type II collagen, with score changes differences of 0.93 (p = 0.042) and 0.34 (p = 0.048), respectively. No significant changes in level of serum cartilage oligomeric proteinase were found in either group. CONCLUSION: Dextrose prolotherapy is an alternative injection therapy for knee osteoarthritis, which was found to be associated with a significant reduction in urinary C-terminal telopeptide of type II collagen compared with hyaluronic acid injection. Neither injection method resulted in reduced serum cartilage oligomeric proteinase.",

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) has been scarcely researched among patients with diabetes mellitus. This study aims to confirm the preventive and therapeutic effects of undenatured type II collagen (UC II) on OA in aging db/db mice and in patients with T2DM. Firstly, aging db/db mice were randomly assigned to three groups: the UC II intervention (UC II) group, old model (OM) group and positive control group. Meanwhile db/m mice and young db/db mice were used as the normal control and young control groups, respectively. Secondly, fifty-five T2DM patients diagnosed with knee OA were randomly assigned to two groups: UC-II and placebo control groups. After a three-month intervention in both mice and T2DM patients, the subjects' gait and physical activities were assessed and the serum biomarkers including inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress factors and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were measured. Compared with the OM group mice, those in the UC II group showed a significantly greater superiority in terms of motor functions including the movement trajectories area (163.25 ± 20.3 vs. 78.52 ± 20.14 cm2), the tremor index (0.42 vs. 1.23), standing time (left hind: 0.089 ± 0.03 vs. 0.136 ± 0.04 s), swing (right front: 0.12 ± 0.02 vs. 0.216 ± 0.02 s), stride length (right hind: 7.2 ± 0.9 vs. 5.7 ± 1.1 cm), step cycle (right hind: 0.252 ± 0.05 vs. 0.478 ± 0.11 s) and cadence (14.12 ± 2.7 vs. 7.35 ± 4.4 steps per s). In addition, the levels of IL-4, IL-10, CTX- II and TGF-β in the UC II group were 1.74, 2.23, 1.67 and 1.84 times higher than those in the OM group, respectively, while the levels of MMP-3 and MMP-13 in the UC II group were half those in the OM group. Correspondingly, UC II intervention significantly decreased the scores of pain, stiffness and physical function (p < 0.05), whereas the 6 MWT and total MET distances in the UC II group increased remarkably (p < 0.05). After a three-month period of intervention, the varus angle significantly decreased from 4.6 ± 2.0° to 3.0 ± 1.4° and the knee flexion range obviously increased from 57.9 ± 14.0° to 66.9 ± 10.4°. Importantly, the declining trend in the levels of hs-CRP and MDA and the incremental trend in the SOD level were consistent in the db/db mice and OA patients following UC II administration.",

The present study was designed to test the effects of undenatured type II collagen (UC-II®) on joint inflammation in the monoiodoacetate (MIA) OA model. We also investigated possible mechanisms underlying these effects. Female Wistar rats were divided into three groups: (i) Control; (ii) MIA-induced rats treated with vehicle; (iii) MIA-induced rats treated with UC-II (4 mg/kg BW). OA was induced in rats by intra-articular injection of MIA (1 mg) after seven days of UC-II treatment. UC-II reduced MIA-induced Kellgren-Lawrence scoring (53.3%, P < 0.05). The serum levels of inflammatory cytokines [IL-1β (7.8%), IL-6 (18.0%), TNF-α (25.9%), COMP (16.4%), CRP (32.4%)] were reduced in UC-II supplemented group (P < 0.0001). In the articular cartilage, UC-II inhibited the production of PGE2 (19.6%) and the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-a, COX-2, MCP-1, NF-κB, MMP-3, RANKL (P < 0.001). The COL-1 and OPG levels were increased, and MDA decreased in UC-II supplemented rats (P < 0.001). UC-II could be useful to alleviate joint inflammation and pain in OA joints by reducing the expression of inflammatory mediators."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: SC-E3 is a polyherbal formula that contains five medicinal herbs used frequently in traditional herbal medicine. In our previous study, we demonstrated the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of SC-E3. The present study examined the effects of SC-E3 in a mouse model of type-II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). METHODS: In vivo, male DBA/1J mice were immunized by intradermal injection of bovine type-II collagen and complete or incomplete Freund's adjuvant, to induce arthritis. SC-E3 was orally administered daily for 23 days. In vitro, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were treated with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) in the absence or presence of SC-E3. RESULTS: Administrations of SC-E3 were found to have anti-arthritic effects in the joints of CIA mice, as evidenced by reduced paw swelling, bone erosion and deformation, inflammatory cell infiltration, and inflammation in synovial membrane. SC-E3 also reduced serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. Furthermore, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive osteoclast numbers in the joints were significantly lower in SC-E3-treated CIA mice than in CIA mice. In addition, the differentiations of BMMs to multinucleated osteoclasts induced by M-CSF and RANKL stimulation were dose-dependently reduced by SC-E3. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that SC-E3 possesses substantial anti-arthritic activity because it inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines and osteoclastogenesis, and that SC-E3 has potential therapeutic use for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Rhamnella gilgitica Mansf. et Melch. (སེང་ལྡེང་།, RG) is a traditional Tibetan medicinal plant that is currently grown throughout Tibet. According to the theory of Tibetan medicine, RG is efficient for removing rheumatism, reducing swelling, and relieving pain. Hence, it has been used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Tibet for many years. However, there are no previous reports on the anti-RA activities of ethyl acetate extract of RG (RGEA). AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to explore the anti-RA effect and mechanism of RGEA on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CIA model was established in male Wister rats by intradermal injection of bovine type II collagen and Complete Freund's Adjuvant at the base of the tail and left sole, respectively. The rats were orally administered with RGEA (9.71, 19.43, or 38.85 mg/kg) for 23 days. The body weight, swelling volume, arthritis index score, thymus and spleen indices, and pathological changes were observed to evaluate the effect of RGEA on RA. Furthermore, the inflammatory cytokines in serum, such as interleukin1 beta (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin6 (IL-6), interleukin17 (IL-17), interferon-γ (INF-γ), interleukin4 (IL-4), and interleukin10 (IL-10) were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to explore the anti-inflammatory effects of RGEA. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) staining was used to examine apoptosis. Finally, the protein and gene expression of B-cell lymphoma-2-associated X (Bax), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Caspase3, janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), suppressor of cytokine signaling1 (SOCS1), and 3 (SOCS3) in synovial tissue were detected using immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). RESULTS: After the treatment with RGEA, the body weight of rats was restored, both the arthritis index and paw swelling were suppressed, and spleen and thymus indices were decreased. RGEA reduced the inflammatory cells and synovial hyperplasia in the synovial tissue of the knee joint, and suppressed bone erosion. Meanwhile, RGEA decreased the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, TNF-α, and INF-γ, while increased the levels of IL-4 and IL-10. TUNEL fluorescence apoptosis results confirmed that RGEA obviously promoted the apoptosis of synovial cells. Further studies showed that RGEA inhibited the proteins and mRNAs expression of JAK2 and STAT3 as well as increased the proteins and mRNAs expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3. In addition, RGEA upregulated the expression of Bax and Caspase3, and downregulated the expression of Bcl-2. CONCLUSION: The anti-RA effectof RGEA might be related to the promotion of apoptosis and inhibition of inflammation, which regulated the JAK-STAT pathway.",

Venous blood samples were collected and serum pyridinoline (PYD), type II collagen cleavage neoepitope (C2C) and osteocalcin (OC) levels were quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In the brucellosis group, the median serum levels of PYD (278.53 µg/L), C2C (82.23 µg/L) and OC (8.41 µg/L) were significantly elevated relative to the control group (Z = 5.686, 3.997, 3.579; P = 0.000).

Antibodies to CII appear around the clinical onset of the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a subset of patients. They target specific epitopes on CII and can be pathogenic or protective. Assays for early detection of such autoantibodies may provide new opportunities for selecting effective treatment strategies of RA. We report the efficient and reproducible assembly of an array of covalently branched native and citrullinated triple helical peptides (THPs) from CII that contain defined autoantibody epitopes. Both monoclonal antibodies and sera from experimental mouse models show a unique reactivity toward the THPs, compared to cyclic peptides containing the epitopes, revealing the importance that the epitopes are displayed in a triple-helical conformation. Importantly, antibodies against three of the THPs that contain major CII epitopes were found to be increased in sera from patients with RA, compared to control persons. These results indicate that such synthetic THPs should be included in multiplex analysis of autoantibodies that are uniquely occurring in individuals with early RA, to provide valuable information on disease prognosis and on what type of therapy should be chosen for individual patients.",

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common joint disease affecting millions of elderly people worldwide. However, the mechanism of OA is complicated and remains poorly understood. Thus, a safe and effective therapeutic strategy has yet to be developed. G protein-coupled receptor 17 (GPR17) is an orphan receptor that is widely distributed in the central nervous system (CNS). GPR17 has become a target for the treatment of inflammation in brain diseases. In this study, we demonstrate that GPR17 is expressed in ATDC5 cells and is increased in response to TNF-α exposure. We also found that antagonism of GPR17 with pranlukast significantly inhibited oxidative stress by downregulating the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increasing the activity of super oxide dismutase (SOD) against TNF-α. Interestingly, treatment with pranlukast prevented TNF-α-induced reduction of type II collagen. Additionally, knockdown of GPR17 with siRNA ameliorated TNF-α-induced loss of type II collagen, suggesting the importance of the role of GPR17 in mediating the impairment of type II collagen. Blockage of GPR17 with pranlukast suppressed the expression of matrix metalloproteinases 3 (MMP-3) and matrix metalloproteinases 13 (MMP-13), which contribute to the degradation of type II collagen. Pranlukast also prevented the activation of the JAK2/STAT1/IRF-1 signaling pathway, thereby suppressing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enzymes. Furthermore, pranlukast rescued TNF-α-induced reduced SOX-9 expression. Together, our data indicate that GPR17 might be a potential target for the treatment of OA.",

Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the involvement of integrin α2β1 in T-2 toxin-induced C28/I2 chondrocyte damage. The pathological damage of articular cartilage injury induced by T-2 toxin was observed by H&E staining. The expression levels of collagen 2 and MMP-13 (Matrix metalloproteinases 13) were detected using immunohistochemistry in articular cartilage tissues and western blotting in the cells. The blocking effect of integrin α2β1 inhibitor on T-2 toxin-induced chondrocyte matrix degradation was examined by western blotting. Further, the effect of integrin α2β1 inhibitor on T-2 toxin-induced chondrocyte apoptosis was analyzed. About 100 ng/g body weight (BW)/day T-2 toxin was fed to Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, T-2 toxin treatment (0, 6, 12, and 24 ng/mL) induced C28/I2 chondrocytes. Both in vivo and in vitro, chondrocyte survival was inhibited, and the production of type II collagen was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). However, the level of MMP-13 was up-regulated (p < 0.05). Matrix degradation was effectively blocked after the pre-treatment by integrin α2β1 inhibitor (p < 0.05). Conclusively, Integrin α2β1 is a critical signaling pathway for communication between cells and the extracellular matrix, the present study provides a new clue to elucidate the mechanism of T-2 toxin-induced chondrocyte damage.",

This study reports a sensing strategy with antibody-conjugated gold nanoparticles (GNP) on an interdigitated electrode (IDE) to determine uCTX-II. The GNP-antibody complex was chemically immobilized on the IDE surface through the amine linker. uCTX-II was determined by monitoring the alteration in current upon interacting the GNP-complexed antibody. This strategy was improved the detection by attracting higher uCTX-II molecules, and the detection limit falls in the range of 10-100 pM with an acceptable regression value [y = 0.6254x - 0.4073, R² = 0.9787]. The sensitivity of the detection was recognized at 10 pM. Additionally, upon increasing the uCTX-II concentration, the current changes were increased in a linear fashion. Control detection with nonimmune antibody and control protein do not increase the current level, confirming the specific detection of uCTX-II. This method of detection helps in diagnosing osteoarthritis and its follow-up treatment.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Osteoarthritis (OA) is an age-related chronic degenerative disease. Accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) induces degradation of the articular extracellular matrix (ECM) and is considered a critical step toward the development and progression of OA. GPR40 is a well-known free fatty acid receptor, which possesses pleiotropic effects in different types of diseases. However, the biological function of GPR40 in OA is indistinct. The purpose of the present study was to determine the impact of the GPR40 agonist GW9508 on AGEs-treated chondrocytes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cultures of human SW1353 chondrocytes were stimulated with GW9508, followed by exposure to 100 µg/mL AGEs. Gene and protein expression of TNF-α, IL-6, MMP-3, MMP-13, ADAMTS-4, and ADAMTS-5 were measured by real-time PCR and ELISA analysis. The levels of type II collagen, aggrecan, and nuclear NF-κB p65 were measured by Western blot analysis. A luciferase assay measured the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. RESULTS: The results show that treatment with AGEs decreased the expression of GPR40 in human SW1353 chondrocytes. Treatment with GW9508 plays a beneficial role in protecting type II Collagen and aggrecan from degeneration by attenuating the expression of MMP-3, MMP-13, ADAMTS-4, and ADAMTS-5. Additionally, GW9508 reduces the appearance of pro-inflammatory cytokines and suppresses NF-κB activation in AGEs-induced chondrocytes. Notably, co-treatment with GW1100, a specific antagonist of GPR40, abolishes the beneficial role of GW9508 against AGEs, implying that GPR40 mediates these effects of GW9508. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that GPR40 is a novel therapeutic target for OA and that GPR40 agonists, including GW9508, may have therapeutic potential in preventing and slowing the progression of OA.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the possibility and mechanism of targeted blocking SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling pathway using three antagonists TN14003, T140, and AMD3100 in vivo, and to investigate the function of three antagonists in delay degeneration process of articular cartilage. METHODS: Ninety-six male Duncan-Hartley guinea pigs (6 months old) were divided into groups A, B, C, and D randomly. Alzet trace pump was implanted in the back subcutaneous tissue of pigs in group A, and TN14003 with concentration of 180 μg/ml was pumped every day. Alzet trace pump was implanted in the back subcutaneous tissue of pigs in group B, and T140 with concentration of 180 μg/ml was pumped every day. Alzet trace pump was implanted in the back subcutaneous tissue of pigs in group C, and AMD3100 with concentration of 180 μg/ml was pumped every day. Hartley guinea pigs in group D remained untreated as the blank control group. At 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks of treatment, 5 to 8 animals in each group were randomly chosen for blood collection via cardiac puncture. SDF-1 content using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). At 12 weeks, all guinea pigs were sacrificed by injecting pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg) into the peritoneal cavity. Cartilages from the tibial plateau in each group were harvested for PCR testing and western blot analysis. SPSS19.0 was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Result of ELISA: the serum levels of SDF-1 of groups A, B, and C decreased gradually with time. Significant drop of SDF-1 level was seen in group A while increased SDF-1 was shown in group D. At the same time, the serum levels of SDF-1 of the group A were significantly lower than that of group B; those of group B were significantly lower than that of group C, which was significantly lower than that of group D, and their difference is statistically significant (P < 0.05). Real time quantitative PCR result: The mRNA levels of MMPs in group A were significantly lower than group B, and those of group B were significantly lower than group C, which was significantly lower than group D, and there was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The mRNA levels of type II collagen, aggrecan in group A were significantly more than group B; those of group B were significantly more than group C, which was significantly more than group D, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). H&E staining result: cartilage of group C was more significantly degenerative than other groups. CONCLUSIONS: The three antagonists can target SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling pathway in vivo, reduce the expression and secretion of MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-13 in cartilage tissue, and reduce the degradation of collagen II and aggregating proteoglycan, thus delaying the degeneration of articular cartilage, of which TN14003 has the strongest regulatory effect. Targeted blockade of SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling pathway by TN14003 in vivo delays articular cartilage degeneration more effectively than T140 and AMD3100.",

METHODS: Twenty-five subjects radiographically diagnosed with knee OA were recruited. Participants were evaluated through three-dimensional gait analysis, uCTX-II level, the WOMAC pain and physical function scores, and the 40m walk test. The association between these variables was investigated using Pearson's product-moment correlation, followed by a hierarchical linear regression, controlled by OA severity and body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: No relationship was found between uCTX-II level and knee moments. A significant correlation between uCTX-II level and pain, physical function, and the 40m walk test was found. The hierarchical linear regression controlling for OA severity and BMI showed that uCTX-II level explained 9% of the WOMAC pain score, 27% of the WOMAC physical function score, and 7% of the 40m walk test.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The regeneration of supportive periodontal tissues after destructive periodontal disease has become one of the primary objectives of periodontal therapy. Demineralized bone matrix (Osseograft), when used, has shown osteoinductive potential and collagen membrane (GTR) prevents the migration of epithelium into it. The literature showed that eggshell which consists of hydroxyapatite and calcium carbonate shows osteoconductive as well as inductive properties. Eggshell membrane which is made of type X collagen matrix can be used as a barrier membrane. Hence, the aim of the study was to compare the demineralized bone matrix with GTR membrane to eggshell constituents and its membrane as a regenerative material in Wistar rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A critical size periodontal defect of 1.5 × 6 mm was created on either side adjacent to mandibular incisors after raising the full thickness flap. Osseograft and collagen membrane covered the defect on one side and the eggshell components and its membrane filled the defects. The animals were sacrificed on the 45th day. RESULTS: Histological evaluation showed intensive new bone formation on both sides of the defect. Inflammation has resolved completely with no signs of eosinophils. Complete defect healing was noted in both the defects. A minimal amount of epithelial entrapment was noted in both the sites. There was no significant difference observed between the comparisons. More connective tissue was found in the test group. CONCLUSION: Within the limits, it can be concluded that eggshell powder along with membrane can be used as a potential graft material.",

Along this line of research, we have presently studied the effects of DAC in a murine model of rheumatoid arthritis induced by type II collagen and have demonstrated that DAC administration was associated with a significant amelioration of the clinical condition, along with in vivo and ex vivo modification of the immunological profile of the so-treated mice, that exhibited a diminished production of Th1 and Th17 pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduction of anti-type II collagen autoantibodies."

We evaluated the relation between clinical pain measures and evoked pain in relation to structural damage and biochemical biomarkers in knee OA. METHODS: A cross-sectional study in people with knee OA and healthy controls was conducted. A total of 130 participants with advanced OA requiring total knee replacement (TKR) (n = 78), mild OA having standard care (n = 42) and non-OA controls (n = 6), with four drop-outs were assessed. Pain scoring was performed by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities OA Index (WOMAC_P) and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Pain sensitization was assessed by pain pressure thresholds (PPTs). Knee magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessed joint damage using the MRI Knee OA Score (MOAKS). Overall MOAKS scores were created for bone marrow lesions (BMLs), cartilage degradation (CD), and effusion/Hoffa synovitis (tSyn). Type II collagen cleavage products (CTX-II) were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: The advanced OA group had a mean age of 68.9 ± 7.7 years and the mild group 63.1 ± 9.6. The advanced OA group had higher levels of pain, with mean WOMAC_P of 58.8 ± 21.7 compared with the mild OA group of 40.6 ± 26.0. All OA subjects had pain sensitization by PPT compared with controls (p < 0.05). WOMAC_P correlated with the total number of regions with cartilage damage (nCD) (R = 0.225, p = 0.033) and total number of BMLs (nBML) (R = 0.195, p = 0.065) using body mass index (BMI), age, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) as covariates. Levels of CTX-II correlated with tSyn (R = 0.313, p = 0.03), nBML (R = 0.252, p = 0.019), number of osteophytes (R = 0.33, p = 0.002), and nCD (R = 0.218, p = 0.042), using BMI and age as covariates. A multivariate analysis indicated that BMI and HADS were the most significant predictors of pain scores (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: People with both mild and advanced OA show features of pain sensitization. We found that increasing MRI-detected joint damage was associated with higher levels of CTX-II, suggesting that increasing disease severity can be assessed by MRI and CTX-II biomarkers to evaluate OA disease progression."

This study is aimed to explore the possible pharmacological mechanisms of anti-arthritic effect of GSZD. METHODS: Type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model was used to study the anti-arthritic activity of GSZDin vivo, and toe swelling & arthritis score, serum levels of cytokines, and pathological examinations were carried out. In vitro, TNF-α induced MH7A cells were used to study the possible mechanisms of GSZD. The anti-proliferative effects of GSZD were determined by MMT assay, and pro-apoptotic activity of GSZD in MH7A cells was determined by flow cytometry analysis & DAPI staining. Furthermore, the adhesive and invasive abilities of MH7A cells were determined using cell adhesion and transwell assays. MMPs levels were determined by ELISA assays, and mRNA expressions of Caspase-3, -9, Bax, SOCS1, Bcl-2, JAK2, STAT-3 and -5 were determined using qRT-PCR analysis. Besides, the major chemical components in GSZD were analyzed by HPLC-QqQ-MS analysis. RESULTS: Our results showed GSZD reduced the toe swelling & arthritis score, and serum levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 & IL-17a in CIA rats; pathological examination results indicated GSZD improved ankle joint injury in CIA rats.In vitro, GSZD showed significant anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on TNF-α stimulated MH7A cells. After GSZD treatment, the adhesive and invasive abilities of MH7A cells were reduced, and secretions of MMPs, IL-6 and IL-8 were also reduced. GSZD decreased the releases of TNF-α and IL-1β in LPS stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Further studies showed GSZD up-regulated mRNA expressions of Caspase-3, -9, Bax, and SOCS1, whereas down-regulated mRNA expressions of Bcl-2, JAK2, STAT3 and STAT5. Besides, 13 major chemical components were identified in GSZD extracts through HPLC-QqQ-MS analysis. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested GSZD possesses an anti-rheumatic effect on CIA rats, and the possible mechanism is related to inhibiting inflammatory response, inhibiting invasion and migration of synovial fibroblasts, and inducing apoptosis in synovial fibroblasts.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The persistence, biodistribution, and risk of integration into the host genome of any new therapeutic DNA vaccine must be established in preclinical studies. We previously developed the DNA vaccine pcDNA-CCOL2A1 encoding chicken type II collagen (CCII) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In the present study, we characterized its dynamic profile, biodistribution, and potential for genomic DNA integration in normal vaccinated rodent. RESULTS: A real-time quantitative PCR analysis (RT-qPCR) of animals administered a single dose of pcDNA-CCOL2A1 (300 μg/kg by intramuscular injection) showed that CCOL2A1 mRNA level in the blood peaked between 2 and 6 h post-immunization and then rapidly declined, and was undetectable between day 1-42. CCOL2A1 transcript was detected at the muscle injection site on days 3-14 post-immunization. Starting from day 14, the transcript was detected in the heart, liver, lung, and kidney but not in the spleen or thymus, and was expressed only in the lung on day 28. There was no CCOL2A1 mRNA present in the testes or ovaries at any time point. Non-invasive in vivo fluorescence imaging revealed CCII protein expression from 2 h up to day 10 and from 2 h up to day 35 after administration of pcDNA-CCOL2A1 via the intravenous and intramuscular routes, respectively; the protein had disappeared by day 42. Importantly, CCOL2A1 was not integrated into the host genome. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that pcDNA-CCOL2A1 vaccine is rapidly cleared within a short period of time and is therefore safe, and merits further development as a therapeutic vaccine for RA treatment.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of undenatured type II collagen (UC-II) as compared to robenacoxib in dogs affected by OA. Our hypothesis was that the two compounds would be similar (non-inferiority) in improving mobility. To test this hypothesis, a complete orthopedic examination, x-ray and the Liverpool Osteoarthritis in Dogs (LOAD) survey were performed in dogs affected by OA before and after the treatments. The study was designed as a clinical, randomized, controlled and prospective study. Sixty client-owned dogs were randomized in the R group (n = 30, robenacoxib 1 mg/kg/day for 30 days) and in the UC-II group (n = 30, UC-II 1 tablet/day for 30 days). Thirty days after the beginning of the treatment (T30), the dogs were reassessed for the LOAD, MOBILITY and CLINICAL scores. Based on the data obtained from the study, a significant reduction in LOAD and MOBILITY scores was recorded between T0 and T30 with a similar magnitude among the two groups (R = 31.5%, p < 0.001; UC-II = 32.7%, p = 0.013). The results of this study showed that UC-II and robenacoxib were able to similarly improve mobility of dogs affected by OA."

The aim of the present work is to explore the mechanistic effects of glycyrrhizin (GL)and/or platelet rich plasma (PRP) treatment on collagen induced arthritis. 75 female Wistar rats were allocated into five equal groups. Group I: control group. Group II: arthritis group (A group); arthritis was induced by type-II collagen Group III: Glycyrrhizin treated group(A + GL group), Group IV: platelet rich plasma treated group(A + PRP group)and Group V: combined treatment group(A + GL + PRP group). Hind paw joint tissue levels of high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB-1), beclin-1 and nuclear factor (erythroid-2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) DNA binding activity were detected by ELISA. Activities of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and catalase enzymes were determined spectrophotometrically. mRNA expression levels of microtubule associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) was detected by quantitative real time PCR. After 8 weeks treatment, there was improvement of inflammation and autophagy biomarkers by the significant reduction of HMGB-1 and beclin-1 levels, down regulation ofLC3mRNA expression. On the other hand, we monitored restoration of the anti-oxidant status through the inhibited MPO activity besides induction of both catalase and Nrf2-DNA binding activities. It could be concluded that, the mutual use of both PRP and GL had a greater effect than each alone against arthritis which is considered a novel finding that can highlight the regenerative and ameliorative effects of this combined treatmentthus launching promising avenues for RA treatment.",

Lunasin, a well-known peptide present in the soybean, has displayed a positive impact on numerous physiological functions. Little information in the effects of lunasin on cartilage degradation has been sought in clinical research before. Here, we report that lunasin suppressed the increase in MMP-3 and MMP-13 caused by IL-1β. In addition, we found that lunasin could prevent the decrease in TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 expressions caused by IL-1β. Notably, lunasin suppressed reduction of type II collagen, the basis for articular cartilage. Lunasin also attenuated activation of the JAK2/STAT1/IRF-1 pathway. These effects of lunasin suggest that it might become a promising therapeutic agent for chondro-protective therapy.",

In the present study, we investigated the effects of saxagliptin, a novel dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) inhibitor, on several important aspects of the pathophysiology of OA using primary human chondrocytes. The results of real-time PCR and ELISA analyses show that saxagliptin treatment significantly decreased mRNA and protein expression of three key cartilage degrading enzymes: matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13. The results of western blot confirmed that this decrease in MMP-1, -3, and -13 expression prevented degradation of type II collagen. We also found that saxagliptin significantly inhibited expression of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motif (ADAMTS)-4 and ADAMTS-5, which was reflected by markedly decreased degradation of aggrecan. Inhibition of DPP-4 by saxagliptin also reduced oxidative stress in human primary chondrocytes as evidenced by decreased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased glutathione (GSH) levels. Additionally, the results of western blot analysis show that the effects of saxagliptin are mediated through the p38/IκBα/NF-κB pathway, which is considered an important treatment target for OA. These findings suggest a potential role for saxagliptin as a novel treatment against OA.",

The immobilized neutral protease was successfully prepared with an activity of 400.5 U/g. The CIEH-MS system loaded with immobilized neutral protease had high operational stability with enzyme decay constant of 0.0077 and half-life of 89.61 hr. Using a CIEH-MS system, the immunomodulatory peptides were obtained with lymphocyte proliferation of 66.23%, peptide yield of 23.43%, degree of hydrolysis (DH) of 22.41%, and permeate flux of 6.17 L/m2 h. The peptide fractions were further purified and the P3-2-4 fraction (RGQLGPM) with 760.4 Da molecular weights exhibited the highest lymphocyte proliferation activity (85.54%) and binding ability to human leukocyte antigen-DRB1 (HLA-DRB1) molecules (133.2 ng/ml). The results demonstrated that CIEH-MS system is an effective way to obtain immunomodulatory peptides from CII. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Chick sternal cartilage is one of the by-products of meat processing, and it is often discarded as waste or used for low-value purposes. CII is the most abundant collagen in chick sternal cartilage, and recently studies have demonstrated that CII peptides possess the ability to induce immunologic tolerance for the treatment of chronic disease. In order to find potential applications for this by-product, immunomodulatory peptides from CII hydrolysates in chick sternal cartilage were isolated using a novel CIEH-MS system. The result showed that CII peptides exhibited a high immunomodulatory activity, and had a potential application in functional foods and medical fields.",

METHODS: Forty six patients with symptomatic knee Osteoarthritis (OA) were enrolled in this open-label, prospective, multicenter, pilot study. Patients received two treatment cycles of intra-articular injections (3 mL) of HYMOVIS® (8 mg/mL of hyaluronic acid hexadecylamide) at 6 months interval. Each treatment cycle involved two intra-articular injections 1 week apart. All patients had Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the target knee at baseline and 1 year, and blood samples to assess joint biomarkers. The primary outcome was the change in type II collagen-specific biomarkers (Coll2-1, Coll2-1NO2 and CTX-II) after HYMOVIS® treatment versus baseline. Secondary endpoints included levels changes in aggrecan chondroitin sulfate 846 epitope (CS-846), Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein (COMP), procollagen type II N-terminal propeptide (PIIANP), Matrix Metalloprotease (MMP)-3, Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and Interleukin (IL)-6 serum biomarkers, the ratio Coll2-1/PIIANP, CTX-II/PIIANP, variation of MRI cartilage volume, and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) index. RESULTS: Coll2-1 serum levels significantly increased overtime while Coll2-1NO2 levels were only increased at D360. Serum PIIANP levels also progressively and significantly enhanced with time. In contrast, other serum biomarker levels including CTX-II, CS-846, COMP, MMP-3, MPO or IL-6 did not change significantly overtime. Interestingly, the ratios Coll2-1/PIIANP and CTX-II/PIIANP decreased, indicating a decrease of cartilage catabolism. Compared to baseline value, MRI cartilage volume and thickness increased in lateral femoral and lateral trochlea compartments and not in medial compartment. These results, in addition to an improvement of T2 mapping score suggest a positive structural effect of the product. Interestingly, WORMS effusion score, an indicator of synovitis, significantly decreased. Finally, global KOOS score and subscales significantly increased overtime while pain at rest, walking pain and patients or investigators global assessment of disease activity decreased. The safety profile was favorable with a low incidence of injection-site pain. CONCLUSION: HYMOVIS®, a well-tolerated intra-articular treatment, significantly enhanced type II collagen turnover as suggested by the increase in Coll2-1 and PIIANP levels and cartilage volume observed by MRI in lateral knee compartment. Importantly, this study provides critical information for the design of a larger phase III clinical trial investigating Disease Modifying effect of HYMOVIS®.

In the current study, we showed that TGR5 is expressed in human primary chondrocytes and human chondrosarcoma SW1353 cells. Interestingly, expression of TGR5 was reduced in response to TNF-α treatment in SW1353 cells. Our results indicate that activation of TGR5 using its specific agonist INT-777 reduced TNF-α-induced degradation of the articular ECM, including type II collagen and aggrecan, by inhibiting expression of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), MMP-13, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs- 4 (ADAMTS-4) and ADAMTS-5. We also found that INT-777 treatment inhibited phosphorylation of p38 and activation of the IκB kinase/inhibitory κBα/nuclear factor- κB (IKK/IκBα/NF-κB) signaling pathway. Notably, knockdown of TGR5 abolished the protective effects of INT-777 against ECM degradation, suggesting the involvement of TGR5. Our findings implicate that TGR5 might be considered as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of OA.",

      "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by systemic, symmetrical, and erosive synovitis. RA is one of the most common disabling diseases in the clinic. The main clinical intervention strategies are early diagnosis and early treatment. This study aims to predict the diagnostic value of 68Ga-citrate and 18F-FDG PET/CT in RA by comparing and analyzing the value of 68Ga-citrate and 18F-FDG PET/CT for diagnosing type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in rats. Some CIA models were established. Normal rats were selected as the control group, and 23 days and 40 days were selected as the early and late time points of arthritis, respectively. The semiquantitative analysis of CIA rats was carried out with 68Ga-citrate PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT, and the ratio of the maximum standardized uptake (SUVmax) values in the regions of interest (ROIs) of the hind foot ankle joint and thigh muscle was calculated and statistically analyzed. The distribution of CIA rats in vivo at the 68Ga-citrate 90 min time point was studied, and the ankle tissues were evaluated with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. 68Ga-citrate PET/CT is obviously superior to 18F-FDG PET/CT for CIA imaging, and the statistical results show that the difference between the two examination methods is statistically significant (P < 0.001). The uptake of these two radiopharmaceuticals showed the same trend in arthritis rats with different scores. The distribution of 68Ga-citrate at 90 min is consistent with the trend shown by 68Ga-citrate PET/CT. 68Ga-citrate PET/CT can reflect the inflammatory activity of affected joints in CIA rats earlier and more sensitively than 18F-FDG PET/CT, and this imaging advantage continues until the later stage of inflammation. Therefore, 68Ga-citrate PET/CT is worthy of further promotion and application in the clinical diagnosis of RA.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS The CIA rat model was established by induction type II collagen, and IL-10-modified BMSCs was established by transfecting BMSCs with adenovirus. IL-10-modified BMSCs were used to treat the CIA rats. The therapeutic effect was evaluated by measuring the changes in body weight, ankle swelling, and forced swimming time, as well as observation of synovial hyperplasia and cartilage tissue repair by HE staining. Western blot analysis and ELISA were used to detect gene expression. RESULTS After 4 weeks and 8 weeks of treatment with IL10-BMSCs, the body weight, swelling value, resting time, and forced swimming struggle time of CIA rats were significantly higher than those of BMSCs-treated and -untreated CIA rats (P<0.05). Compared to BMSCs-treated CIA model rats, after treatment with IL10-BMSCs, the repair rate of osteoarticular cartilage was higher and the inhibition of synovial proliferation was better, and serum IL-17, IL-1ß, and TNF-alpha levels were lower. We found that the protein level of SIRT1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was lower, the protein level in spleen was higher, and phosphorylation of p65 protein in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was reduced. CONCLUSIONS The efficacy of tail vein injection of IL-10-modified BMSCs in treatment of CIA rats was superior to that of BMSCs alone, which may be related to the more pronounced suppression of IL-10-modified BMSCs in peripheral blood inflammation and spleen immune response.",

Excessive degradation of type II collagen and aggrecan by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif (ADAMTS) induced by AGEs is a pivotal event in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. In addition, activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway induces the expression of a cascade of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). In the present study, we investigated the effects of salicin, one of the main constituents of aspirin and a derivative of Alangium chinense, on AGE-induced degradation of the articular extracellular matrix in SW1353 human chondrocytes. Our findings reveal a novel beneficial role of salicin in rescuing degradation of type II collagen and aggrecan, reducing oxidative stress, attenuating expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and inhibiting activation of the NF-κB proinflammatory signaling pathway in chondrocytes stimulated with AGEs. Salicin may thus have potential as a safe and effective therapy against the development and progression of OA.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Saururus chinensis leaves have been used as traditional medicine in Korea for pain, intoxication, edema, and furuncle. According to previous reports, these leaves exert renoprotective, neuroprotective, and antioxidant effects by attenuating inflammatory responses. However, the beneficial effect of Saururus chinensis leaves on arthritis has not been elucidated. Thus, we evaluated the water extract of Saururus chinensis leaves (SHW) using type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice models. METHODS: Quantitative analysis of major components from SHW was performed by HPLC. Arthritis was induced by injection of type II collagen. Each group was orally administered SHW (100 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg). Methotrexate (MTX) was used as a positive control. Serum levels of interleukin-6, TNF-alpha, and type II collagen IgG in the animal models were measured using ELISA. Histological features were observed by H&E staining. RESULTS: Quantitative analysis of SHW showed the contents as 56.4 ± 0.52 mg/g of miquelianin, 7.75 ± 0.08 mg/g of quercetin 3-O-(2\"-O-β -glucopyranosyl)-α-rhamnopyranoside, and 3.17 ± 0.02 mg/g of quercitrin. Treatment with 500 mg/kg SHW decreased the serum level of Interleukin-6 (IL-6), TNF-alpha, and collagen IgG in the CIA model. Moreover, SHW treatment diminished the swelling of hind limbs and monocyte infiltration in blood vessels in CIA animal models. The results indicate that SHW could decrease CIA-induced arthritis in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that SHW could be used to improving arthritis by reducing inflammatory factors (IL-6 and TNF-alpha). However, further experiments are required to determine how SHW influences signal transduction in animal models.",

Our study aimed to investigate the anti-rheumatoid arthritis effects of A. roxburghii polysaccharides (ARP), using the rat's model of type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). ARP was prepared by alcohol sedimentation and structurally characterized based on combined chemical, chromatographic and spectroscopic methods. High Performance Size Exclusion Chromatography-Multiangle Laser Light Scattering-Refrative Index (HPSEC-MALLS-RI) analysis revealed that ARP includes two peaks, and the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of the principal one was estimated as 5.90 kDa with a relative content of 98.2%. Pharmacological results exhibited that ARP significantly decreased the arthritis index and ameliorated the inflammatory cell infiltration and the synovial tissue destruction in CIA rats. Additionally, ARP possessed significant NO production inhibitory effects and antioxidant activity. Further anti-inflammatory mechanism investigations indicated that ARP significantly inhibited the activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway by suppressing the phosphorylation of IκB and p65, which subsequently down-regulated the mRNA expressions of IL-1β and IL-6 in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. These findings suggested that ARP has great potential in the development of functional foods and dietary supplements for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.",

MATERIAL/METHODS: Forty, three-month-old female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into four groups: Sham, Ovariectomy (OVX), E2 and ICI182780 (ICI). Sham group only underwent the resection of a bit fat; OVX group underwent bilateral ovariectomy; E2 group was treated with E2 based on OVX; ICI group was treated with E2 and pretreated ICI182780 (inhibitor of the estrogen receptor) based on OVX. Radiography, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blot and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) were applied to detect the apoptosis characteristics of intervertebral disc cells. RESULTS: Radiographs showed marked intervertebral disc narrowing and HE staining showed typical apoptosis characteristics of intervertebral disc cells in OVX, which were reversed by E2. Furthermore, the results of IHC, Western blot and qRT-PCR revealed that OVX-induced IVDD was protected by E2 through decreasing the expression of caspase-3 and intracellular matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP-3 and MMP-13, while increasing the expression of collagen Type II. All of the detected effects of E2 were abolished after treatment with ICI182780. CONCLUSION: 17β-E2 inhibits IVDD by down-regulating MMP-3 and MMP-13 and up-regulating collagen Type II in a rat model.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In the current study, the effect of glucosamine methyl ester on cartilage degeneration in osteoarthritis rat model was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned into 5 groups of 8 animals each. Osteoarthritis was induced in 4 groups using medial parapatellar incision followed by anterior cruciate ligament transection and meniscectomy. Normal and model osteoarthritis groups were given normal saline. The three treatment groups received 2, 5 and 10 mg/kg doses of glucosamine methyl ester daily for one month. RESULTS: Microscopic examination of the knee cartilage showed a significant reduction in degeneration score in the treatment groups. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed inhibition of interleukin-1β expression and nitric oxide generation on treatment with glucosamine methyl ester. Expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-3 and -13 in the treatment groups were significantly lower compared to the model osteoarthritis group. Polymerase chain reaction revealed an increased expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 on treatment of rats with glucosamine methyl ester. In the osteoarthritis rats treated with various doses of glucosamine methyl ester staining, the level of toluidine blue and Masson's trichrome increased. In addition, the level of type II collagen was also higher in the rats of treatment group. The level of proteoglycan, collagen and type II collagen in OA rats treated with 10 mg/kg doses was ~3.2- (p<0.01), 2.4- (p<0.02), and 3.6- (p<0.05) fold, respectively higher compared to the untreated animals. CONCLUSIONS: Glucosamine methyl ester, therefore, prevents degeneration of cartilage in osteoarthritis rats. It exhibits its effect by promoting proteoglycan, collagen, type II collagen, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1, and decreasing matrix metalloproteinase. Therefore, glucosamine methyl ester exhibits therapeutic effect against osteoarthritis.",

Forkhead box (Fox)-A2 is an essential transcription factor for the formation of a normal NP. We demonstrated that type II collagen stimulates NP-like differentiation of ADSCs, partly by increasing the expression of FoxA2. We constructed FoxA2-overexpressing and -knockdown ADSCs by using lentiviral vectors. FoxA2 overexpression significantly enhanced NP-specific gene expression and the synthesis of glycosaminoglycan and collagen, whereas FoxA2 knockdown decreased NP-like differentiation and the expression of aggrecan and collagen II. The enhanced NP-like differentiation related to FoxA2 overexpression was partially rescued by an Shh signaling pathway inhibitor. In addition, FoxA2 inhibited the expression of Itg-α2 and further promoted NP-like differentiation induced by type II collagen. Furthermore, FoxA2-overexpressing ADSCs combined with type II collagen hydrogels promoted regeneration of degenerated NP in vivo. Our findings suggest that FoxA2 plays an essential role in the NP-like differentiation of ADSCs by activating the Shh signaling pathway.-Zhou, X., Ma, C., Hu, B., Tao, Y., Wang, J., Huang, X., Zhao, T., Han, B., Li, H., Liang, C., Chen, Q., Li, F.

      "abstract": "Collagen from marine organisms has a broad prospect in biomedical field, yet the knowledge on marine-derived type II collagen is rare. Herein, a novel type II collagen was successfully isolated from squid cartilage for the first time. After being characterized, the immunogenicity of squid type II collagen (SCII) was evaluated and compared with that of bovine type II collagen (BCII). Then investigations were further conducted for the impacts of SCII on pro-inflammatory macrophages and macrophage chemotaxis. The degenerative osteoarthritis (OA) -relieving effects of SCII were explored using OA rat model in vivo. Our results demonstrated that the isolated SCII maintained triple-superhelical structure of native collagen with high purity. Different from BCII, SCII presented no immunogenicity since it neither induced abnormal proliferation of lymphocytes in vitro nor changed the basic levels of IgM, IgG, anti-type II collagen IgG and CD4+/CD8+ lymphocytes ratio in vivo. Additionally, SCII also exerted prominent anti-inflammatory effects. SCII significantly reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by enhancing the activity of TCPTP and subsequently prompting the dephosphorylation of p-STAT1 in pro-inflammatory macrophages. Besides, it indirectly prevented hypertrophic changes of chondrocytes, and markedly impeded chemotaxis of macrophages. Moreover, inflammation condition in OA rats was significantly alleviated under treatment with SCII. These data suggested that the newly developed SCII could not only avoid the immunogenic risks of collagen derived from terrestrial animals, but more importantly, provide new choice for the control and treatment of OA.",

      "abstract": "Excessive expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) has been associated with destruction of the articular cartilage matrix in chondrocytes from patients with osteoarthritis (OA). Among the MMPs, MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-13 participate in the degradation of type II collagen, the main component of the extracellular matrix in articular cartilage. Sodium butyrate is a bacterial metabolite used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. However, the effects of sodium butyrate on the expression of MMPs and degradation of type II collagen has not been explored. In the current study, for the first time, we aimed to determine whether sodium butyrate influences IL-1β-induced degradation of type II collagen in human chondrocytes in the articular cartilage matrix. Our results indicate that sodium butyrate significantly abrogated IL-1β-induced up-regulation of MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13 at both the gene and protein levels. In addition, treatment with sodium butyrate suppressed expression of the endogenous tissue inhibitors TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. Notably, sodium butyrate attenuated IL-1β-induced degradation of type II collagen. Mechanistically, we found that sodium butyrate abolished the activation of NF-κB by inhibiting phosphorylation of IKK, IκBα, and NF-κB p65. Based on these observations, we conclude that butyrate may have potential as a therapeutic agent for OA.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Nucleus pulposus (NP) degeneration is usually the origin of intervertebral disc degeneration and consequent lower back pain. Although adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC)-based therapy is regarded to be promising for the treatment of degenerated NP, there is a lack of viable cell carriers to transplant ADSCs into the NP while maintaining cell function. In this study, we developed a type II collagen/chondroitin sulfate (CS) composite hydrogel-like ADSC (CCSA) delivery system with genipin as the cross-linking agent. The induction effect of the scaffold on ADSC differentiation was studied in vitro, and a rat coccygeal vertebrae degeneration model was used to investigate the regenerative effect of the CCSA system on the degenerated NP in vivo. The results showed that the CCSA delivery system cross-linked with 0.02% genipin was biocompatible and promoted the expressions of NP-specific genes. After the injection of the CCSA system, the disc height, water content, extracellular matrix synthesis, and structure of the degenerated NP were partly restored. Our CCSA delivery system uses minimally invasive approaches to promote the regeneration of degenerated NP and provides an exciting new avenue for the treatment of degenerative disc disease. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Nucleus pulposus (NP) degeneration is usually the origin of intervertebral disc degeneration and consequent lower back pain. Stem cell-based tissue engineering is a promising method in NP regeneration, but there is a lack of viable cell carriers to transplant ADSCs into the NP while maintaining cell function. In this study, we developed a type II collagen/chondroitin sulfate (CS) composite hydrogel-like ADSC (CCSA) delivery system with genipin as the cross-linking agent. Although several research groups have studied the fabrication of injectable hydrogel with biological matrix, our study differs from other works. We chose type II collagen and CS, the two primary native components in the NP, as the main materials and combined them according to the natural ratio of collagen and sGAG in the NP. The delivery system is preloaded with ADSCs and can be injected into the NP with a needle, followed by in situ gelation. Genipin is used as a cross-linker to improve the bio-stability of the scaffold, with low cytotoxicity. We investigated the stimulatory effects of our scaffold on the differentiation of ADSCs in vitro and the regenerative effect of the CCSA delivery system on degenerated NP in vivo.",

Crocin has been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects in animal models. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic effects of crocin on type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in Wistar rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CIA rat model was established and randomly divided into five groups with or without crocin treatment (10, 20 or 40 mg/kg), which was started on day 21 after arthritis induction and persisted for 36 days. The symptoms and molecular mechanisms of CIA and crocin-treated CIA rats were compared and investigated. RESULTS: CIA rats presented severe RA symptoms, including high arthritis score, paw swelling, joint inflammation, bone erosion, chondrocyte death, cartilage destruction, enhanced expressions of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, crocin could mitigate these symptoms. Crocin (40 mg/kg) exhibited the most efficient therapeutic function on CIA rats: the histological scores of joint inflammation, bone erosion, chondrocyte death, cartilage surface erosion, and bone erosion of CIA rats receiving 40 mg/kg crocin treatment were comparable to the normal rats. MMP-1, -3 and -13 protein expression levels of CIA rats with 40 mg/kg crocin treatment were decreased to levels similar to normal rats. Moreover, crocin could also inhibit the expression of TNF-α, IL-17, IL-6 and CXCL8 in serum and ankle tissues of CIA rats. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, crocin exhibits therapeutic potential for RA, by mitigating the symptoms and inhibiting the pro-inflammatory factor expression.",

Adipose-derived stem/stromal cells (ADSCs) were collected from three male Fischer 344 rats and characterized by flow cytometry. Fifty female Fischer 344 rats were distributed into five groups of 10 animals each. These groups were as follows: control, OA, OA PBMT, OA ADSC, and OA ADSC PBMT. OA was induced in the animals using a 4% papain solution. Animals from the OA ADSC and OA ADSC PBMT groups received an intra-articular injection of 10 × 106 ADSCs and were treated with PBMT by irradiation (wavelength: 808 nm, power: 50 mW, energy: 42 J, energy density: 71.2 J/cm2, spot size: 0.028). Euthanasia was performed 7 days after the first treatment. The use of PBMT alone and the injection of ADSCs resulted in downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and MPs in cartilage compared to the OA group. PBMT and ADSCs caused upregulation of tissue inhibitors of MPs 1 and 2 and mRNA and protein expression of COL2-1 in cartilage compared to the OA group. The intra-articular injection of ADSCs and PBMT prevented joint degeneration resulting from COL2-1 degradation and modulated inflammation by downregulating cytokines and MMPs in the OA group.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Advances in the development of biomaterials and stem cell therapy provide a promising approach to regenerating degenerated discs. The normal nucleus pulposus (NP) cells exhibit similar phenotype to chondrocytes. Because dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) can be differentiated into chondrogenic cells, the DPSCs and DPSCs-derived chondrogenic cells encapsulated in type I and type II collagen hydrogels can potentially be transplanted into degenerated NP to repair damaged tissue. The motility of transplanted cells is critical because the cells need to migrate away from the hydrogels containing the cells of high density and disperse through the NP tissue after implantation. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the motility of DPSC and DPSC-derived chondrogenic cells in type I and type II collagen hydrogels. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: The time lapse imaging that recorded cell migration was analyzed to quantify the cell migration velocity and distance. METHODS: The cell viability of DPSCs in native or poly(ethylene glycol) ether tetrasuccinimidyl glutarate (4S-StarPEG)-crosslinked type I and type II collagen hydrogels was determined using LIVE/DEAD cell viability assay and AlamarBlue assay. DPSCs were differentiated into chondrogenic cells. The migration of DPSCs and DPSC-derived chondrogenic cells in these hydrogels was recorded using a time lapse imaging system. This study was funded by the Regional Institute on Aging and Wichita Medical Research and Education Foundation, and the authors declare no competing interest. RESULT: DPSCs showed high cell viability in non-crosslinked and crosslinked collagen hydrogels. DPSCs migrated in collagen hydrogels, and the cell migration speed was not significantly different in either type I collagen or type II collagen hydrogels. The migration speed of DPSC-derived chondrogenic cells was higher in type I collagen hydrogel than in type II collagen hydrogel. Crosslinking of type I collagen with 4S-StarPEG significantly reduced the cell migration speed of DPSC-derived chondrogenic cells. CONCLUSIONS: After implantation of collagen hydrogels encapsulating DPSCs or DPSC-derived chondrogenic cells, the cells can potentially migrate from the hydrogels and migrate into the NP tissue. This study also explored the differential cell motility of DPSCs and DPSC-derived chondrogenic cells in these collagen hydrogels.",

      "abstract": "Effective treatment of rheumatoid arthritis can be mediated by native chicken type II collagen (nCCII), recombinant peptide containing nCCII tolerogenic epitopes (CTEs), or a therapeutic DNA vaccine encoding the full-length CCOL2A1 cDNA. As recombinant CCII (rCCII) might avoid potential pathogenic virus contamination during nCCII preparation or chromosomal integration and oncogene activation associated with DNA vaccines, here we evaluated the importance of propeptide and telopeptide domains on rCCII triple helix molecular assembly. We constructed pC- and pN-procollagen (without N- or C-propeptides, respectively) as well as CTEs located in the triple helical domain lacking both propeptides and telopeptides, and expressed these in yeast Pichia pastoris host strain GS115 (his4, Mut+) simultaneously with recombinant chicken prolyl-4-hydroxylase α and β subunits. Both pC- and pN-procollagen monomers accumulated inside P. pastoris cells, whereas CTE was assembled into homotrimers with stable conformation and secreted into the supernatants, suggesting that the large molecular weight pC-or pN-procollagens were retained within the endoplasmic reticulum whereas the smaller CTEs proceeded through the secretory pathway. Furthermore, resulting recombinant chicken type II collagen pCα1(II) can induced collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model, which seems to be as effective as the current standard nCCII. Notably, protease digestion assays showed that rCCII could assemble in the absence of C- and N-propeptides or telopeptides. These findings provide new insights into the minimal structural requirements for rCCII expression and folding.",

However, the potential effects and mechanism of SAMC on IL-1β-stimulated chondrocytes are unclear. METHODS: Chondrocytes were isolated, and 5 ng/mL of IL-1β was added to mimic the in vitro osteoarthritis (OA) model. SAMC (20 and 60 μM) was used for the treatment in OA model. Cell viability was assessed by MTT method. Western blotting, Quantitative RT-PCR, and ELISA were performed to evaluate the mechanisms in SAMC treated OA model. RESULTS: Following 48 h of IL-1β exposure, SAMC exhibited protection effect on IL-1β-injured chondrocyte viability. Type II collagen was elevated with reduced degradation products, as a consequence of altered MMPs/TIMP-1 ratio after SAMC treatment in IL-1β-treated chondrocytes. The protein and mRNA level of TNF-α in cellular supernatant and cells were downregulated in a dose-dependent manner. Besides, IκBα in cytoplasmic fraction was increased, while p65 level in nuclear fraction was decreased after SAMC treatment in OA. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that SAMC may play a protective role in IL-1β induced osteoarthritis (OA) model. This effect may be through inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway, therefore altering the MMPs/TIMP-1 ratio change which induced type II collagen destruction and decreasing inflammatory cytokine secretion such as TNF-α.",

Therefore, new techniques are being tested for cartilage repair, using scaffolds and/or stem cells. Although type II collagen hydrogel, fibrin sealant, and adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) represent suitable alternatives for cartilage formation, their combination has not yet been investigated in vivo for focal articular cartilage defects. We performed a simple experimental procedure using the combination of these 3 compounds on cartilage lesions of rabbit knees. Design The hydrogel was developed in house and was first tested in vitro for chondrogenic differentiation. Next, implants were performed in chondral defects with or without ASCs and the degree of regeneration was macroscopically and microscopically evaluated. Results Production of proteoglycans and the increased expression of collagen type II (COL2α1), aggrecan (ACAN), and sex-determining region Y-box 9 (SOX9) confirmed the chondrogenic character of ASCs in the hydrogel in vitro. Importantly, the addition of ASC induced a higher overall repair of the chondral lesions and a better cellular organization and collagen fiber alignment compared with the same treatment without ASCs. This regenerating tissue also presented the expression of cartilage glycosaminoglycan and type II collagen. Conclusions Our results indicate that the combination of the 3 compounds is effective for articular cartilage repair and may be of future clinical interest."

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is an inflammatory joint disease characterized by degeneration of articular cartilage within synovial joints. An estimated 27 million Americans suffer from OA, and the population is expected to reach 67 million in the United States by 2030. Thus, it is urgent to find an effective treatment for OA. Traditional OA treatments have no disease-modifying effect, while regenerative OA therapies such as autologous chondrocyte implantation show some promise. Nonetheless, current regenerative therapies do not overcome synovial inflammation that suppresses the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to chondrocytes and the expression of type II collagen, the major constituent of functional cartilage. We discovered a synergistic combination that overcame synovial inflammation to form type II collagen-producing chondrocytes. The combination consists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) δ agonist, human bone marrow (hBM)-derived MSCs, and hyaluronic acid (HA) gel. Interestingly, those individual components showed their own strong enhancing effects on chondrogenesis. GW0742, a PPAR-δ agonist, greatly enhanced MSC chondrogenesis and the expression of type II collagen and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) in hBM-MSC-derived chondrocytes. GW0742 also increased the expression of transforming growth factor β that enhances chondrogenesis and suppresses cartilage fibrillation, ossification, and inflammation. HA gel also increased MSC chondrogenesis and GAG production. However, neither GW0742 nor HA gel could enhance the formation of type II collagen-producing chondrocytes from hBM-MSCs within human OA synovial fluid. Our data demonstrated that the combination of hBM-MSCs, PPAR-δ agonist, and HA gel significantly enhanced the formation of type II collagen-producing chondrocytes within OA synovial fluid from 3 different donors. In other words, the novel combination of PPAR-δ agonist, hBM-MSCs, and HA gel can overcome synovial inflammation to form type II collagen cartilage within human OA synovial fluid. This novel articularly injectable formula could improve OA treatment in the future clinical application.",

METHODS: Twenty male rats were subjected to partial medial meniscectomy tear (PMMT) surgery to induce OA. Immediately after the surgery 10 rats received vehicle and another 10 rats oral daily dose of UC-II at 0.66 mg/kg for a period of 8 weeks. In addition 10 naïve rats were used as an intact control and another 10 rats received sham surgery. Study endpoints included a weight-bearing capacity of front and hind legs, serum biomarkers of bone and cartilage metabolism, analyses of subchondral and cancellous bone at the tibial epiphysis and metaphysis, and cartilage pathology at the medial tibial plateau using histological methods. RESULTS: PMMT surgery produced moderate OA at the medial tibial plateau. Specifically, the deterioration of articular cartilage negatively impacted the weight bearing capacity of the operated limb. Immediate treatment with the UC-II preserved the weight-bearing capacity of the injured leg, preserved integrity of the cancellous bone at tibial metaphysis and limited the excessive osteophyte formation and deterioration of articular cartilage. CONCLUSION: Study results demonstrate that a clinically relevant daily dose of UC-II when applied immediately after injury can improve the mechanical function of the injured knee and prevent excessive deterioration of articular cartilage.",

However, the roles of KLF2 in chondrocytes and the pathological progression of osteoarthritis (OA) remain unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the function of KLF2 in the inhibition of cartilage matrix destruction in chondrocytes. METHODS: RT-PCR and western blot analysis was used to determine the expression of KLF2 in human chondrocytes. Luciferase assay, ELISA assay and MMP-13 enzymatic activity assays were used to investigate the effects of KLF2 in regulating MMP-13 expression. Western blot analysis was used to examine the effects of KLF2 in suppressing degradation of type Ⅱ collagen. RESULTS: KLF2 is expressed in primary chondrocytes and is downregulated in OA chondrocytes. Expression of KLF2 in primary chondrocytes was reduced in response to IL-1β. Overexpression of KLF2 robustly inhibited IL-1β-induced MMP-13 expression. Conversely, knockdown of KLF2 markedly exacerbated MMP-13 expression. Mechanistically, KLF2 could suppress the activation of MMP-13 promoter. However, knockdown of KLF2 could promote the activation of MMP-13 promoter. Importantly, overexpression of KLF2 ameliorated the degradation of type Ⅱ collagen while silencing of KLF2 exacerbated the degradation of type Ⅱ collagen induced by IL-1β. CONCLUSIONS: KLF2 may be a potential therapeutic target for OA treatment.",

      "abstract": "Full‑thickness and large area defects of articular cartilage are unable to completely repair themselves and require surgical intervention, including microfracture, autologous or allogeneic osteochondral grafts, and autologous chondrocyte implantation. A large proportion of regenerative cartilage exists as fibrocartilage, which is unable to withstand impacts in the same way as native hyaline cartilage, owing to excess synthesis of type I collagen in the matrix. The present study demonstrated that low‑dose halofuginone (HF), a plant alkaloid isolated from Dichroa febrifuga, may inhibit the synthesis of type I collagen without influencing type II collagen in the extracellular matrix of chondrocytes. In addition, HF was revealed to inhibit the phosphorylation of mothers against decapentaplegic homolog (Smad)2/3 and promoted Smad7 expression, as well as decrease the synthesis of type I collagen synthesis. Results from the present study indicated that HF treatment suppressed the synthesis of type I collagen by inhibiting the transforming growth factor‑β signaling pathway in chondrocytes. These results may provide an alternative solution to the problems associated with fibrocartilage, and convert fibrocartilage into hyaline cartilage at the mid‑early stages of cartilage regeneration. HF may additionally be used to improve monolayer expansion or 3D cultures of seed cells for the tissue engineering of cartilage.",

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major problem during rheumatoid arthritis which leads to morbidity and mortality in arthritic patients. So the present study emphasizes combinatorial effect of Betulinic acid, a triterpenoid and fluvastatin, an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor on atherogenesis during arthritis. Arthritis was induced by bovine type II collagen dissolved in 0.01M acetic acid at a concentration of 4mg/mL and emulsified in equal volume of incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Betulinic acid (2mg/kg) and fluvastatin (5mg/kg) alone and in combination was administered orally from day 14 to 60. At the end of 60days, tissues and blood were isolated for evaluation of biochemical parameters. Treatment with betulinic acid and fluvastatin showed significant (p<0.05) reduction in Arthritic index, Rheumatoid factor, C-reactive protein (CRP), total lipids and anti-CCP (cyclic citrullinated peptide) antibody. Anti-inflammatory enzyme activities and oxidative stress were significantly decreased in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells by the administration of both betulinic acid and fluvastatin than alone treatments. Combination therapy was found to be a potential enhancer of the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 whereas it significantly blocked the expression of Toll-like receptors-2 and 4, inflammatory markers such as interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, Interferon-γ, cell adhesion molecules and nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B in aorta than drug alone treated groups. So the present study summarizes a combination therapy of betulinic acid and fluvastatin that reduces the risk of both rheumatoid arthritis and CVD by modulating the expression of various inflammatory mediators through Toll-like receptors-4-NF-κB downstream signaling pathway, atherogenic index and oxidative stress in collagen induced arthritis.",

      "abstract": "Curcumin possesses strong anti-inflammatory, anti-rheumatoid and anti-oxidative activities, and has the potential to inhibit nuclear factor‑κB (NF‑κB) signaling. Cartilage damage in osteoarthritis (OA) is largely mediated by interleukin-1β (IL-1β) via activation of various transcription factors, including NF‑κB and activator protein‑1. The aim of the present study was to determine whether IL‑1β induces matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) expression and inhibits type II collagen expression, as well as to examine whether cell proliferation may be inhibited by curcumin through the inhibition of NF‑κB signaling. The effects of curcumin were investigated in rat articular chondrocyte cell cultures treated with IL‑1β in the presence or absence of curcumin or the NF‑κB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate. Western blotting and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction were conducted to evaluate protein and mRNA expression levels of type II collagen, MMP‑13, NF‑κB inhibitor α (IκBα), phosphorylated‑IκBα and NF‑κB subunit p65/RelA. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were performed to examine the effects of curcumin on the expression, phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF‑κB‑associated proteins. The effects of curcumin on cell proliferation were evaluated by Cell Counting Kit‑8 (CCK‑8). Curcumin was demonstrated to inhibit the IL‑1β‑induced activation of NF‑κB by suppressing IκBα phosphorylation and p65/RelA nuclear translocation. These events were associated with the downregulation of MMP‑13 expression and the upregulation of type II collagen expression, both of which are considered to be NF‑κB targets. CCK‑8 assays revealed that co‑treatment with curcumin resulted in increased proliferation in IL‑1β‑treated chondrocytes. These findings implicated curcumin as a naturally occurring anti‑inflammatory agent for the treatment of OA via inhibition of NF‑κB signaling.",

      "abstract": "The pathological progression of osteoarthritis (OA) involves degradation of articular cartilage matrix. Type II collagen is the main component of cartilage matrix, which is degraded by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β mediated by MMP-13. Nebivolol, a licensed drug used for the treatment of hypertension in clinics, displays its anti-inflammatory capacity in various conditions. However, whether Nebivolol has a protective effect on cartilage matrix degradation has not been reported before. In this study, we investigated the effects of Nebivolol on regulating the expression of MMP-13 and degradation of type II collagen. Our results indicate that Nebivolol alleviated the increase in gene expression, protein expression, and activity of MMP-13 induced by IL-1β. Importantly, IL-1β strikingly reduced the levels of type II collagen in cell culture supernatants, which was reversed by treatment with Nebivolol in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, Nebivolol was found to alleviate the increased levels of phosphorylated IκBα and reduced levels of total IκBα induced by IL-1β, which subsequently mitigated p65 nuclear translocation and the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. Furthermore, our results indicated that IL-1β treatment resulted in a significant increase in expression of the transcriptional factor interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) at both the mRNA and protein levels, which was significantly ameliorated by treatment with Nebivolol. The combination of these findings suggests that Nebivolol can potentially be applied in human OA treatment.",

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common cause of pain and disability and is often associated with the degeneration of articular cartilage. Lesions to the articular surface, which are thought to progress to OA, have the potential to be repaired using tissue engineering strategies; however, it remains challenging to instruct cell differentiation within a scaffold to produce tissue with appropriate structural, chemical and mechanical properties. We aimed to address this by driving progenitor cells to adopt a chondrogenic phenotype through the tailoring of scaffold composition and physical properties. Monomeric type-I and type-II collagen scaffolds, which avoid potential immunogenicity associated with fibrillar collagens, were fabricated with and without chondroitin sulfate (CS) and their ability to stimulate the chondrogenic differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells was assessed. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that cells produced abundant collagen type-II on type-II scaffolds and collagen type-I on type-I scaffolds. Gene expression analyses indicated that the addition of CS - which was released from scaffolds quickly - significantly upregulated expression of type II collagen, compared to type-I and pure type-II scaffolds. We conclude that collagen type-II and CS can be used to promote a more chondrogenic phenotype in the absence of growth factors, potentially providing an eventual therapy to prevent OA.",

We previously found that PSA exhibits immunosuppressive activity both in vitro and in vivo. Balanced regulation of helper T 17 (Th17)/regulatory T (Treg) cells is the current therapeutic direction for the treatment of RA. The present study investigated the mechanism of PSA in treating collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). The therapeutic effects and potential pharmacological mechanisms of PSA were specifically clarified by examining its effects on CIA in DBA/1 mice. PSA administration significantly relieved the severity of the arthritis, and preventive administration of PSA reduced the incidence of arthritis in the mice with CIA and relieved joint damage in terms of morphology. PSA was also able to reduce the levels of anti-collagen II (CII) antibodies and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum. As a result, the proportion of Th17 cells decreased, and the proportion of Treg cells increased. A follow-up study of the ex vivo immunological reactions induced by a specific antigen found that PSA suppressed lymphocyte proliferation, inhibited the differentiation and reactivity of Th17 cells, and promoted the proportion of Treg cells among helper T cells. PSA also exhibited pharmacological effect in regulating the balance between Th17 and Treg cells in CIA through relevant signalling pathways. Thus, PSA played a specific role in CIA treatment. In particular, our results suggest that the therapeutic effects of PSA on RA are partially realized via the regulation of the balance of Th17/Treg cells.",

METHODS: Collagen-induced arthritis was induced in C57BL/6 mice by immunisation with type II collagen. After immunisation, the mice were treated with Zaocys type II collagen. Clinical and histological scores were assessed and the cytokine levels in the serum and lymphocytes supernatant from the spleen and mesenteric lymph node were determined by enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay. The T-helper 17 cell and regulatory-T cell frequencies were analysed by flow cytometry and the expression of interest markers was examined by direct immuno-fluorescence. RESULTS: The arthritis score and severity of histological inflammation and cartilage destruction were dose-dependently reduced after treatment. The analysis results indicated that Zaocys type II collagen significantly increased the proportion of regulatory-T cells and lowered the T-helper 17 cells, it also increased the number of regulatory-T cells and conversely decreased the T-helper 17 cells in synovial tissue compared with the model group. Treatment also caused a higher level of transforming growth factor-β and a decreased production of interleukin -17A. CONCLUSIONS: The oral administration of Zaocys type II collagen potently suppressed the severity of collagen-induced arthritis by repairing the imbalance between regulatory-T cells and T-helper 17 cells, suggesting that it might be a promising candidate for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.",

      "abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are critical for the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which includes cartilage-specific collagen types I, II and XI. We previously found that PEP-1-sirtuin (SIRT)2 could induce dedifferentiation of articular chondrocytes; however, the underlying mechanisms remains unclear. We addressed this in the present study by examining the association between PEP-1-SIRT2 and the expression of MMP-1 and MMP-13 and type II collagen in rabbit articular chondrocytes. We found that PEP-1-SIRT2 increased MMP-1 and -13 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as determined by western blotting. A similar trend in MMP-1 and -13 levels was observed in cultures during expansion to four passages. Pharmacological inhibition of MMP-1 and -13 blocked the PEP-1-SIRT2-induced decrease in type II collagen level. Phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) was increased by PEP-1-SIRT2; however, treatment with the mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor PD98059 suppressed PEP-1-SIRT2-induced MMP-1 and -13 expression and dedifferentiation while restoring type II collagen expression in passage 2 cells. These results suggest that PEP-1-SIRT2 promotes MMP-induced dedifferentiation via ERK signaling in articular chondrocytes.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this randomized controlled study was to evaluate the efficacy of oral native type II collagen treatment on the symptoms and biological markers of cartilage degradation, when given concomitantly with acetaminophen in patients with knee osteoarthritis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine patients diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis were included and randomly distributed into two groups: one treated with 1500 mg/day of acetaminophen (group AC; n=19) and the other treated with 1500 mg/day of acetaminophen plus 10 mg/day of native type II collagen (group AC+CII; n=20) for 3 months. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at rest and during walking, Western Ontario McMaster (WOMAC) pain, WOMAC function, and Short Form-36 (SF-36) scores, were recorded. Coll2-1, Coll2-1NO2 and Fibulin-3 levels were quantified in urine as biomarkers of disease progression. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02237989. RESULTS: After 3 months of treatment, significant improvements compared to baseline were reported in joint pain (VAS walking), function (WOMAC) and quality of life (SF-36) in the AC+CII group, while only improvements in some subscales of the SF-36 survey and VAS walking were detected in the AC group. Comparisons between the groups revealed a significant difference in VAS walking score in favour of the AC+CII group as compared to AC group. Biochemical markers of cartilage degradation in urine did not significantly improve in any of the groups. CONCLUSION: All in all, these results suggest that native type II collagen treatment combined with acetaminophen is superior to only acetaminophen for symptomatic treatment of patients with knee osteoarthritis."
