      "abstract": "AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of chewing gum on postoperative pain in pediatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was conducted as a prospective, randomized controlled single-blind interventional study. Patients were randomized into two groups: control group which received a standard postoperative protocol and the chewing gum group which received the same postoperative protocol. Pain was evaluated by the Wong Baker scale. RESULTS: A total of 75 patients participated in the study, with 40 in the control group and 35 in the chewing gum group. The children's mean age and gender distribution were similar across the groups. According to the independent t-test results, there was a significant difference in pain levels between the chewing gum and control groups on all days. The pain levels in the chewing gum group were lower compared to the control group. Analgesic use was also lower in the gum group on all days (p < 0.05). Generalized linear mixed model analysis confirmed a significant independent effect of chewing gum on pain scores (p < 0.001), though the effect did not vary over time. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, chewing gum may serve as a non-pharmacological method for postoperative pain management. In clinical practice, chewing gum could be a simple, low-cost, and easy-to-implement intervention."

      "abstract": "Dental plaque provides a proper environment for the growth and activity of bacteria responsible for periodontal diseases and caries. As a result, it should be removed by individuals to prevent periodontal diseases and caries. There are different mechanical and chemical plaque control methods. In one study is shown that dental plaque removal efficacy of dentifrice containing Ethylenediaminetetraaceticacid(EDTA)/Methylsulfonylmethane(MSM) was nearly five times that of commercially available fluoride toothpaste. In another study, authors found that xylitol-containing chewing gums caused a marked reduction in the count of Streptococcus Mutans compared to conventional ones. This difference was highly prominent in individuals with poor oral hygiene. In this study we assessed the synergic effects of Xylitol, EDTA and MSM in a chewing gum in comparison with chlorhexidine mouthwash. This study was a crossover, randomized clinical trial. Twenty-four patients were divided in two groups randomly. At the baseline scaling and root planing was done for each patient. Group1 used chlorhexidine mouthwash twice a day. Group2 used novel chewing gum for 15 min twice a day. After 14 days, for every patient O'leary plaque index, gingival index and sulcus bleeding index were reevaluated and recorded. Professional brushing was done for patients. 14 days were considered as wash-out period. After that, method of plaque control of groups was changed. After 14 days, all patients were reevaluated and recorded and were compared with previous data. Samples in 2 groups had no significant difference in age and sex. Paired sample t test revealed that there were significant differences between first and second period for O'leary plaque index, gingival index and sulcus bleeding index in Group1 (P < 0.05). But in Group2 there were no differences between first and second period for all indexes. Also independent sample t test showed that there were no significant differences between baseline, after first treatment and after second one for all indexes in both groups (P > 0.05). According to regression model results, type of treatment had no effect on mean of all indexes. According to our findings which showed the similar efficiency of novel chewing gum and chlorhexidine mouthwash in improving and reducing plaque and gingival indexes, we can conclude that novel chewing gum can be introduced as an effective, cheap and accessible tool for dental plaque control.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Maternal periodontal disease is associated with preterm and low-birthweight deliveries, but randomized trials of likely efficacious treatments (e.g., dental scaling and root planing) during pregnancy have not reduced these adverse outcomes. As an alternative, we hypothesized that periconception initiation of xylitol chewing gum would reduce the occurrence of preterm or low-birthweight deliveries among a historical high-prevalence population in Malawi. METHODS: We conducted an open-label, parallel-enrollment, matched-pair, cluster-randomized, controlled clinical trial across eight health centers (sites) in and around Lilongwe, Malawi. Sites were paired by anticipated delivery volume and randomized to prenatal and oral health education alone (active control) or with twice-daily xylitol chewing gum (intervention) throughout the periconception and antenatal periods. For the primary prevention of preterm (<37 weeks) and low-birthweight (<2,500 g) deliveries (co-primary outcomes), comparison by allocation group was performed using generalized linear mixed models for each outcome as a fixed factor and the site(s) as a random factor. FINDINGS: 10,069 participants were enrolled (n = 4,549 at intervention sites, n = 5,520 at active control sites), with >95% available for analyses. Initiation of xylitol chewing gum resulted in significant reductions in the co-primary outcomes: preterm birth (12.6% [549/4,349] vs. 16.5% [878/5,321]; relative risk [RR] 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57-0.99) and <2,500-g neonates (8.9% [385/4,305] vs. 12.9% [679/5,260]; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49-0.99). Xylitol chewing gum use also led to fewer neonatal demises (0.2% [8/4,305] vs. 0.4% [22/5,260]; RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.19-0.89). CONCLUSIONS: Periconception initiation and ongoing use of xylitol chewing gum significantly reduced the occurrence of preterm and low-birthweight deliveries in Malawi. FUNDING: E.W.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postoperative nausea and vomiting is common after general anesthesia, with consequences for patient outcomes, satisfaction with care, and healthcare costs. The aim was to compare a new treatment, chewing gum, with a widely used intravenous agent, ondansetron, to treat postoperative nausea and vomiting in female patients in the postanesthesia care unit. METHODS: This study was a multicenter, randomized, controlled noninferiority trial in 17 hospitals in Australia and New Zealand. Female patients aged 12 yr or older undergoing volatile anesthetic-based general anesthesia for laparoscopic or breast surgery were enrolled. Protocolized antiemetic prophylaxis was administered. Patients who developed postoperative nausea and vomiting in the postanesthesia care unit were randomized to either 15 min of chewing gum or 4 mg intravenous ondansetron. The primary outcome was cessation of nausea, retching, or vomiting with no recurrence nor rescue medication for 2 h after administration of the randomized intervention ( i.e. , complete response). RESULTS: Of 865 enrolled patients, 218 were randomized. In a per-protocol analysis, 50 of 105 (47.6%) ondansetron-treated patients compared with 31 of 103 (30.1%) chewing gum-treated patients achieved the primary outcome (absolute risk difference [95% CI], -17.3 [-30.4 to -4.3]%), not reaching the prespecified noninferiority limit. The time to complete response was longer for patients randomized to chewing gum (hazard ratio [95% CI], 0.53 [0.34 to 0.83]), and they were more likely to receive antiemetics in the 24 h after surgery (absolute risk difference [95% CI], 14.1 [1.6 to 26.5]%). CONCLUSIONS: Chewing gum cannot be recommended as an alternative to ondansetron for treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting in female patients administered antiemetic prophylaxis.",

Fourteen national-level (age: 25.2 ± 5.4; height: 176.5 ± 5.3; weight: 78.1 ± 13.4) ice hockey players were tested late at night after a full day awake schedule with jet lag. A randomised, double-blind experimental design was employed in which participants either chewed caffeinated gum (CAF) containing 3 mg/kg caffeine or a caffeine-free placebo gum (PLA) for 10 min prior to undertaking a series of on-ice and off-ice tests. The off-ice tests included grip force, the counter-movement jump (CMJ), and the squat jump (SJ). The on-ice tests included a 35 m sprint, the S-Shape agility test, and the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test (Yo-Yo IR1 test). The CMJ height (CAF: 47.2 ± 4.4; PL: 45.9 ± 3.5; p = 0.035; Cohen's d = 0.32) and SJ height (CAF: 46.7 ± 4.1; PL: 44.9 ± 3.8; p = 0.047; Cohen's d = 0.44) were found to be significantly higher in the CAF than in the PL trial. However, there were no significant differences (p > 0.05) in grip force, as well as in the 35 m sprint, the S-Shape agility test, and the Yo-Yo IR1 test. The present study found that, following a jet lag intervention, although the consumption of caffeinated gum resulted in an increase in vertical jump height, it had no impact on performance in the ice tests. The results of this study may help coaches and athletes consider the need for caffeine supplementation when experiencing jet lag.",

      "abstract": "Identifying the cause of death in road traffic incidents and the contributing factors is crucial for forensic investigations, public health research, and epidemiological studies. In this case, the discovery of chewing gum in the larynx during an autopsy complicated the forensic diagnostic process and challenged the determination of the primary cause of death. Our case report details a 53-year-old male driver involved in a fatal road traffic accident. First responders found him unconscious and unresponsive. Despite resuscitative efforts, including endotracheal intubation, he could not be revived. The autopsy revealed multiple blunt force injuries from the collision and chewing gum in the larynx. The gum may have been aspirated while driving, potentially causing choking, severe coughing, or reflex cardiac arrest, which could have led to sudden incapacitation and the accident. Alternatively, the gum might have been overlooked during intubation, possibly pushing it deeper into the airway and creating an iatrogenic artifact. The cause of death was attributed to multiple blunt force injuries, specifically head trauma. However, the possibility of foreign body aspiration leading to the accident or the gum being an iatrogenic artifact cannot be ruled out. This case report highlights the potential impact of airway foreign bodies on road accidents and the risk of iatrogenic artifacts during resuscitation. It underscores the importance of thorough airway evaluation, prompt recognition of potential obstructions, and accurate documentation in prehospital settings to prevent worsening obstructions, misdiagnoses, delays in diagnosis, and complications in future cases."

      "abstract": "Background: Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP), or emesis gravidarum, is a frequent complication of early gestation with unclear causes, suspected to involve genetic, hormonal, and gastrointestinal factors. Our study investigated the association of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), histamine, diamine oxidase (DAO), thyroxine and pyridoxine and the severity of NVP symptoms and assessed the efficacy of a vitamin C-containing chewing gum as a potential NVP treatment. Methods: In this prospective, double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial, 111 participants were assigned to receive vitamin C-containing chewing gum, placebo gum, or no treatment at two follow-ups during early pregnancy. Maternal serum levels of hCG, histamine, DAO, thyroxine, and pyridoxine were measured and correlated with NVP severity using the Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis and Nausea (PUQE-24) score. Results: Elevated maternal hCG levels were significantly associated with an increased PUQE-24 score (p < 0.001), while histamine levels showed no significant correlation (p = 0.68). Maternal DAO levels negatively correlated with NVP symptoms (p < 0.001) and elevated thyroxine (p < 0.001) and pyridoxine levels (p < 0.001) were associated with increased PUQE-24 scores. The vitamin C-containing chewing gum did not demonstrate efficacy in alleviating NVP symptoms compared to placebo gum or no treatment during the first (p = 0.62) and second follow-up visits (p = 0.87). Conclusions: Our study underscores the complexity of factors contributing to NVP, highlighting the significant roles of hCG and DAO, while histamine levels appear unrelated. Maternal thyroxine and pyridoxine levels also significantly correlate with NVP symptoms. Vitamin C-containing chewing gum was not effective as a treatment for NVP. Further large-scale studies are needed to better understand these interactions and develop targeted treatments in the future."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chewing gum is a healthy, cheap, and familiar solution for patients with premature irritation of the stomach and intestines. This study compared the effect of chewing gum and the routine method on ileus after burns. METHODS: This study is a randomized clinical trial conducted in Valiasr Hospital in Arak, Markazi Province, in the center of Iran, from December 2021 to February 2023. After the diagnosis of intestinal ileus in 83 patients hospitalized in the burn department by a general surgeon, with the available sampling method, these patients were evaluated based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study. As a result, 66 patients were selected and divided into groups A (33 patients in the intervention group: routine care + gum chewing) and B (33 patients in the control group: routine care) by random allocation method. For the intervention group, from entering the ward until the beginning of oral feeding, gum (without sugar) was chewed four times a day for 15 min, while control groups received the routine diet of the department. Both groups' condition of the bowel sounds, time of passing gas, and stool were recorded. The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 16. The chi-squared, Fisher's exact, Independent t-test, and Mann-Whitney U tests were utilized. RESULTS: The results showed that the median bowel sound return time, time of the first gas discharge, earliest defecation time, and time to start the diet were significantly shorter in the intervention group than in the control group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study showed the effect of chewing gum without sugar in shortening the symptoms of intestinal ileus after burns. However, it was not effective in reducing the hospitalization period of patients. According to these results, it is recommended to add chewing gum to the routine care of people hospitalized due to burns.

DESIGN: A prospective, single-centre, two-arm, parallel, double-blinded randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Orthodontic unit of a privately funded hospital, Chennai, India. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 28 participants were randomly allocated into a chewing gum group (CGG) (n = 14) or a control group (CG) (n = 14). METHODS: Baseline data were collected at the start of retraction (T0), at 4 weeks (T1), 8 weeks (T2) and 12 weeks (T3) after the start of retraction. Rate of space closure, pain, oral hygiene and appliance breakage were assessed at T1, T2 and T3. Data were analysed using an independent t-test with P < 0.05 considered to be statistically significant. RESULTS: The mean rate of space closure in the CGG was 0.9 ± 0.2 mm/month and 0.8 ± 0.2 mm/month in the CG (mean difference 0.1mm/month ± 0.16; 95% confidence interval -0.055-0.26). In both the groups, oral hygiene became worse between T0 and T3. At T0 and T1, participants in the CGG reported less pain at 24 h and 7 days when compared to the CG (P < 0.05). At T2 and T3, participants in the CGG reported less pain at 0 h, 24 h and 7 days when compared to the CG (P < 0.05). Appliance breakage in both groups was minimal, with an odds ratio of 0.7 (95% CI 0.1-3.8) and was similar (P = 0.66). CONCLUSION: There was a minimal increase that was clinically not significant in the rate of space closure with chewing gum. Chewing gum ensured better oral hygiene, helped alleviate pain and had no effect on appliance breakage during space closure.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of chewing gum and using bite wafers in reducing pain after the placement of separators in orthodontic patients and to compare that efficiency with ibuprofen use. Additionally, this study evaluated the effect of non-pharmacological pain control methods on the frequency of separators falling out. METHODS: The study sample comprised 105 female patients between 15 and 35 years of age. The patients were randomly selected and classified into three groups (35 each). Each group was given either ibuprofen, viscoelastic bite wafers, or chewing gum immediately after the placement of separators and every 8 h for 1 week, as needed. The patients were asked to record their pain perception using a visual analog scale following separator placement at 2 h, 6 h, bedtime, 24 h, and at 2, 3, and 7 days. Analysis of variance testing was used for the data analysis. RESULTS: Among the three studied groups, there were no significant differences in pain perception at any time point. The patients experienced significantly higher pain scores at bedtime and 24 h after separator placement. In addition, there were statistically significant findings in pain perception at different time points within each pain relief method (p = 0.000, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The use of chewing gum and bite wafers in alleviating orthodontic pain was beneficial and comparable to ibuprofen use following the placement of separators before orthodontic treatment among orthodontic patients."

The research instrument used was Spielberger's State-Anxiety questionnaire. While there was no significant difference in anxiety scores between the CNC and NNC groups before the intervention, a significant difference was observed in anxiety scores 20 min after the intervention. Within-group comparisons indicated statistically significant differences between pre-test and post-test values of anxiety in the NNC group. The results of this study suggest that natural hydro-distilled neroli-flavored chewing gum can reduce anxiety in university students.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Chewing gums containing antiseptics or other antimicrobial substances may be effective in reducing plaque and gingivitis. Therefore, the aim of this randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial was to investigate the efficacy of a novel antimicrobial chewing gum containing essential oils (cinnamon, lemon, peppermint) and extracts on reduction of dental plaque and gingivitis as well as on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in adolescent orthodontic patients. MATERIALS: 52 patients (11-22 years of age) were randomly assigned to use a test chewing gum (COVIDGUM, Clevergum) or a commercially available control chewing gum over a period of 10 days. Approximal plaque index (API), papillary bleeding index (PBI) and an OHRQoL questionnaire for children (COHIP-G19) were assessed at baseline (BL), after 10 days (10d) and 30 days (30d). In addition, oral health and oral hygiene related questions of the COHIP-G19 questionnaire were evaluated separately in subscales at each timepoint. Data were analyzed using non-parametrical statistical procedures (α = 0.05). RESULTS: API and PBI decreased significantly over time from BL to 10d and from BL to 30d in both groups, without significant differences between the groups. In both groups, the COHIP-G19 score, oral health subscale and oral hygiene subscale decreased significantly over time. Regarding the oral hygiene subscale, the test group showed significantly better scores at 30d (p = 0.011). CONCLUSION: Both chewing gums performed similarly effective in terms of reducing plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation and improving OHRQoL. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Chewing gums without antimicrobial ingredients may be sufficient to decrease plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation.",

Such studies demonstrate the importance of the oral route among patients. The accuracy of drug delivery is very important to achieve a successful therapeutic effect in the case of various pharmaceutical products. A novel drug delivery system adds new benefits or advantages to a drug. This review covers all the aspects of medicated chewing gum (MCG) as a new drug delivery method, including the benefits and drawbacks, manufacturing methods, type of MCG, composition of chewing gum, evaluation parameters, factors that affected the release of API, its pharmaceutical significance, various marketed chewing gum and chewing gum packaging. Chewing gum as a drug delivery system has the potential to cure or prevent various indications, such as analgesic, CNS stimulation, smoking cessation, motion sickness, and treatment and prevention of dental caries or gingivitis. Pharmaceutical distribution to the oral mucosa can be made more convenient and enticing with the help of MCG. Compared to conventional techniques, this delivery system has a longer-lasting effect, which makes it a viable option for treating digestive problems, headaches, migraines, coughing, anxiety, and allergies.",

      "abstract": "Preclinical studies have shown that the combination of Cistus × incanus L. and Scutellaria lateriflora L. extracts exerts beneficial effects on oral health against gingivitis. Thus, this study aimed to assess the tolerability of a chewing gum and its efficacy on gingivitis in a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Enrolled subjects (n = 60, 18-70 years) were randomized to receive two chewing gums or a placebo daily for 3 months. At baseline (t0) and monthly (t1, t2, and t3) timepoints, the Quantitative Gingival Bleeding Index (QGBI), the Modified Gingival Index (MGI), and the Oral Health 15 items (OH-15)] were employed to assess potential improvements in gingivitis. Pain was self-quantified via the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and the Clinical Global Impression Scale for Severity of illness (CGI-S) helped in evaluating the oral general conditions. This study is listed on the ISRCTN registry. At t3, the QGBI, MGI, OH-15, VAS, and CGI-S values decreased in the treated but not in the placebo group (β = 0.6 ± 0.1, t176 = 3.680, p < 0.001; β = 0.87 ± 0.21, t115 = 4.263, p < 0.001; β = 5.3 ± 2.5, t172 = 2.086, p = 0.038; β = 3.16 ± 0.51, t88 = 6.253, p < 0.001; and β = 1.09 ± 0.32, t83 = 3.419, p < 0.001, respectively).

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are often used by smokers as an aid to stopping smoking, but evidence is limited regarding their efficacy compared with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and no evidence is available on how their efficacy compares with that of varenicline. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether ECs are superior to NRT and noninferior to varenicline in helping smokers quit. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a randomized clinical trial conducted at 7 sites in China and including participants who were smoking at least 10 cigarettes per day and motivated to quit, not using stop-smoking medications or EC, and willing to use any of the study products. Participants were first recruited in May 2021, and data analysis was conducted in December 2022. INTERVENTIONS: A cartridge-based EC (30 mg/mL nicotine salt for 2 weeks and 50 mg/mL after that), varenicline (0.5 mg, once a day for 3 days; 0.5 mg, twice a day for 4 days; and 1 mg, twice a day, after that), and 2 mg (for smokers of ≤20 cigarettes per day) or 4 mg (>20 cigarettes per day) nicotine chewing gum, all provided for 12 weeks and accompanied by minimal behavioral support (an invitation to join a self-help internet forum). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was sustained abstinence from smoking at 6 months as validated by an expired-air carbon monoxide reading (<8 parts per million). Participants lost to follow-up were included as nonabstainers. RESULTS: Of 1068 participants, 357 (33.5%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 33.9 (3.1) years. A total of 409 (38.3%), 409 (38.3%), and 250 (23.4%) participants were randomized to the EC, varenicline, and NRT arms, respectively. The 6-month biochemically validated abstinence rates were 15.7% (n = 64), 14.2% (n = 58), and 8.8% (n = 22) in the EC, varenicline, and NRT study arms, respectively. The quit rate in the EC arm was noninferior to the varenicline arm (absolute risk reduction, 1.47%; 95% CI, -1.41% to 4.34%) and higher than in the NRT arm (odds ratio, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.15-3.21). Treatment adherence was similar in all study arms during the initial 3 months, but 257 participants (62.8%) in the EC arm were still using ECs at 6 months, with no further use in the 2 other study arms. The most common adverse reactions were throat irritation (32 [7.8%]) and mouth irritation (28 [6.9%]) in the EC arm, nausea (36 [8.8%]) in the varenicline arm, and throat irritation (20 [8.0%]) and mouth irritation (22 [8.8%]) in the NRT arm. No serious adverse events were recorded. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this randomized clinical trial found that when all treatments were provided with minimal behavior support, the efficacy of EC was noninferior to varenicline and superior to nicotine chewing gum.

METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed on MEDLINE Complete, EMBASE, CINAHL, PubMed, Web of Science, Academic Search Complete, and Cochrane Library databases from their inception to October 2, 2022. Methodological quality was assessed using the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for randomized trials. A meta-analysis was performed using a fixed-effects model to calculate pooled effects with Review Manager 5.4.1. FINDINGS: Twelve randomized trials encompassing 1,458 participants were pooled. The chewing gum intervention was effective in reducing vomiting (P = .007; risk ratio = 0.55; 95% Cl = 0.35-0.85), but not nausea (P = .14; risk ratio = 0.84; 95% Cl = 0.66-1.06). Thirty-minute sessions of gum chewing were significantly more effective in reducing vomiting than 15-minute sessions (P = .04; risk ratio = 0.31; 95% Cl = 0.1-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that repeated gum chewing sessions of at least 30 minutes may act as a nonpharmacological intervention for reducing vomiting. However, further studies are necessary to determine the outcomes of chewing gum interventions.",

We sought to examine the factors associated with chewing gum and its relationship with the oral health status of U.S. adults. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013-2018 cycles were used in these analyses. Primary outcomes were the odds of having gum disease, treatment for gum disease, ever being told of bone loss around teeth, root caries, caries, and restoration. Unadjusted and multivariate logistic regression models were used to investigate the relationship of chewing gum use with demographic/lifestyle factors and the oral health status of participants. RESULTS: 2.40% (n = 365) of adults were users of chewing gum and the average among users was 5.20 ± 0.40 g/d. Users of chewing gum were more likely to be female, younger in age, and non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic. Self-reported chewing gum use did not affect the oral health status of U.S. adults (OR: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.42-2.88 for gum disease; OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 0.64-2.81 for treatment for gum disease; OR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.27-1.17 for bone loss around teeth; OR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.32-3.12 for root caries; OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.54-1.69 for caries), except for restoration (OR: 3.54, 95% CI: 1.78-7.06), but was associated with improved diet quality (OR: 1.86, 95% CI: 1.11-3.12 for a healthy eating index (HEI) of 51-59; OR: 1.96, 95% CI: 1.08-3.56 for HEI of 60-93); and decreased intakes of snacks (OR: 1.64, 1.01-2.69), and added sugars. CONCLUSION: Future observational studies that more accurately capture chewing gum usage are needed, as these analyses have several limitations.",

Design: Prospective, open label, pilot randomised controlled trial. Setting: Two metropolitan ICUs. Participants: Ninety postoperative adult patients admitted to the ICU. Intervention: Patients administered chewing gum, who chewed for at least 15 minutes every 4 hours, were compared with a control group, who were administered a 20 mL sip of water orally every 4 hours. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was the number of patient-reported episodes of nausea in the first 24 hours after the operation. Secondary outcomes included vomiting or dry retching episodes, and duration and severity of nausea. Results: Forty-six patients were randomly allocated to chewing gum and 44 patients to water. There was no difference between groups in the number of patients with nausea (10 [22%] chewing gum v 12 [27%] control patients; P = 0.72), nausea episodes (22 episodes; [median, 0; IQR, 0-0] v 21 episodes [median, 0; IQR, 0-1] per patient in each group respectively), vomiting/retching (2 [4%] chewing gum v 6 [14%] control patients; P = 0.24), or duration/severity of nausea. Conclusion: Regular postoperative administration of chewing gum in a surgical ICU patient cohort did not reduce nausea, vomiting or retching. The prevalence of PONV is less than previously reported. Our findings can inform future studies of PONV prophylaxis in post-surgical ICU patients. Trial registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry No. ACTRN12617001185358."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Postoperative ileus is a common occurrence among children undergoing major operations, including gastrointestinal and spinal surgeries. Preliminary evidence in adults suggests that chewing gum plays a role in accelerating the return of postoperative gastrointestinal function. However, evidence is scarce in the paediatric population. The aim of this study was to investigate whether chewing gum has benefits for children. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Trials databases for randomised controlled trials that compare gum chewing with standard care after elective surgery in children from 1st Jan 2005 to 31st July 2021. We assessed the identified trials for quality and performed a systematic review and meta-analysis in accordance with PRISMA and registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022358801). The main outcome measures examined were time to flatus and stool postoperatively, time to tolerate oral intake, and length of hospital stay, which were analysed using fixed effects models. We also examined clinical complication rates and postoperative pain control. RESULTS: We included six eligible trials, with a total of 357 enrolled patients. The intervention was well tolerated without complications. There was no significant difference in time to flatus (-2.86 h; 95 % CI: -6.2 to 0.47 h, p = 0.09), time to stool (-6.39 h; 95 % CI: -13.9 to 1.2 h, p = 0.1), time to tolerate oral intake (-0.03 days; 95 % CI: -0.15 to 0.1 days, p = 0.68), and length of hospital stay (0.08 days; 95 % CI: -0.07 to 0.22 days, p = 0.29). Postoperative pain control (opioid consumption, pain score, nausea score) was similar in both groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Current evidence demonstrates that gum chewing is not associated with earlier postoperative gastrointestinal recovery in children. Future adequately powered and well-designed trials are necessary to evaluate any clinical benefit of chewing gum for children and whether it could result differences in healthcare satisfaction.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of chewing gum on orthodontic pain and to determine the rate of bracket breakage associated with fixed orthodontic appliances. METHODS: This review and its reporting were performed according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the PRISMA guidelines. Six electronic databases were searched up to March 16, 2023, to identify relevant studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Furthermore, grey literature resources were searched. The Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool 2 was used to assess the quality of the included studies. Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan, and sensitivity analysis and publication bias analysis were performed using STATA software. GRADE tool was used to evaluate the certainty of evidence. RESULTS: Fifteen studies with 2116 participants were ultimately included in this review, and 14 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with the blank group, chewing gum had a significant pain relieving effect at all times after fixation of the initial archwire (P ≤ 0.05). No significant difference was found between the chewing gum group and the analgesics group at any timepoints (P > 0.05). Only four studies evaluated the rate of bracket breakage and revealed that chewing gum did not increase the rate of bracket breakage. The sensitivity analysis showed that there was no significant difference in the pooled outcomes after the included studies were removed one at times, and Egger analysis revealed no significant publication bias in included studies (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Chewing gum is a non-invasive, low-cost and convenient method that has a significant effect on relieving orthodontic pain and has no effect on the rate of bracket breakage. Therefore, chewing gum can be recommended as a suitable substitute for analgesics to reduce orthodontic pain.",

The aim of this research was to study the cytotoxicity, proliferative, and microbiological activities of the active ingredients in different types of cell cultures. The preclinical study of active pharmaceutical ingredients and their combinations was carried out using culture lines such as HepG2 (human hepatocarcinoma cells), Hek293 (human embryonic kidney cells), and MAEC (mouse aortic endothelial cells). MTT assays were used to analyse cytotoxicity and proliferative activity, while the state of antioxidant protection was assessed by the content of sulfhydryl groups and catalase activity. The determination of lipid peroxidation products was based on the level of TBA-active products. As a microbiological model for studying the effect of the developed dental medicine on the ability of the oral cavity microorganisms to form biofilms, the following strains were used: Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Candida albicans. The optical density of the formed biofilm was evaluated by the intensity of the experimental sample's colour on a StatFax 303 Plus photometer at a wavelength of 630 nm. The combination of ascorbic acid and lysozyme hydrochloride in the established concentrations (20 mg and 10 mg per 1 gum, respectively) resulted in a slight stimulation of cell proliferation without any toxic effects and increased antioxidant protection, preventing the development of oxidative stress. It was found that, in contrast to the separately used active substances, the combination of lysozyme hydrochloride and ascorbic acid inhibits the biofilm formation of all studied microorganisms and shows the ability to destroy diurnal biofilms of L. plantarum and fungi of the genus Candida, indicating potentiation and summation of the active pharmaceutical ingredients' composition effects in the developed dental medicine. Due to the observed positive pharmacological and microbiological action, the combination of lysozyme hydrochloride and ascorbic acid in the medicated chewing gum serves as a promising tool for the prevention and treatment of infectious and inflammatory diseases of the periodontium and mucous membranes and the prevention of caries."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and habit cessation counseling are considered the mainstay treatment for high nicotine dependence smokers. However, adherence to NRT is very poor. Among the NRTs, nicotine gums and nicotine patches are the most widely available. This study mainly evaluates the efficacy of nicotine gum and nicotine patches as NRT using salivary cotinine levels as a biochemical validation measure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 72 known smokers who were willing to receive nicotine replacement therapy for cessation of smoking habits. The sample was divided into two groups: Group 1 tobacco smokers were offered nicotine chewing gum, and group 2 tobacco smokers were offered nicotine patches. Both groups received treatment for 12 weeks. At baseline and at the end of the trial period, the saliva samples were analyzed for cotinine levels using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The severity of smoking was assessed using the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND). RESULTS: The quit rate was higher in the nicotine patch group compared with the nicotine gum group. On comparison of week one vs week twelve in the nicotine group nicotine gum group showed (CI: 18.10 to 13.83) and in the patch group (CI: 7.754 to 6.56) with P < 0.001. The pre- and post-cotinine estimation was significantly reduced for nicotine patches compared with nicotine gums, and patient compliance also yielded better results for nicotine patches. CONCLUSION: This study depicts that nicotine patches were better adhered to in comparison with nicotine gums, and salivary cotinine level is an effective biochemical validation measure."

The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to evaluate the risk of bias within the included studies, and the GRADE approach was used to evaluate the certainty of evidence. RESULTS: Sixteen RCTs were included in the final analysis. The meta-analysis revealed that chewing gum significantly reduced pain intensity in comparison to pharmacologic agents (mean difference [MD] -0.50 [95% confidence interval {CI} -0.90 to -0.10], P = .01). When compared with a placebo, chewing gum significantly reduced pain intensity (MD -0.60 [95% CI -1.06 to -0.13], P = .01), while bite wafer and chewing gum groups had the same levels of reduction in pain intensity (MD -0.15 [95% CI -0.56 to 0.26], P = .48). CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment, chewing gum was significantly more effective than both pharmacologic agents and placebo in reducing orthodontic pain 24 hours after the initial placement of the archwire.",

SEARCH SOURCES: An unrestricted search of indexed databases and manual searching was performed up to September 2021. DATA SELECTION: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the impact of chewing gum and CADs on relieving self-reported orthodontic pain were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Data screening, extraction and risk of bias (RoB) assessment were performed by two authors. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model. The quality of available evidence was assessed using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. RESULTS: Nine RCTs were included. Eight RCTs used the Visual Analogue Scale for self-reported pain assessment, while one RCT used the Numeric Rating Scale. Five RCTs had a high RoB and four RCTs had a moderate RoB. Power analysis for sample size estimation was performed in six RCTs. Separate meta-analyses were performed by pooling quantitative data from five RCTs that compared self-reported orthodontic pain between chewing gum and ibuprofen groups for the following timepoints: baseline; immediately; 2 hours; 6 hours; bedtime; 24 hours; 2 days; 3 days; 5 days; and 7 days after the placement of orthodontic appliances. None of the timepoints individually indicated a difference in self-reported pain scores between chewing sugar-free gum and ibuprofen groups. The overall level of evidence was very low. CONCLUSION: Chewing sugar-free gum is a potentially useful alternative to CADs towards pain alleviation during fixed OT.",

When experienced after surgery, they may delay recovery, reduce patient satisfaction and affect the bonding between mother and baby. Various pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches for prophylaxis and treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) have been employed with different degree of efficacy. In this pilot randomised controlled trial, we aimed to determine the possible preventative effects of chewing gum on the rate of PONV in expectant mothers undergoing neuraxial anaesthesia for elective lower segment caesarean section. All participants underwent spinal anaesthesia with administration of 10-11.5 mg of intrathecal heavy Bupivicaine 0.5% according to anaesthetists' preference, Morphine 100 μg and Fentanyl 25 μg. Postoperative analgesia regimen was also standardised. Two hundred ninety-six patients were randomised to an intervention arm to receive chewing gum in addition to standard therapy and to a non-intervention arm to receive standard therapy. After exclusions, 258 patients were followed up 24 h postoperatively. Standard therapy is defined as Ondansetron 4 mg IV intra-operatively. The primary outcomes were the incidences of nausea and vomiting in the first 24 h postoperatively. Secondary outcomes were the number of episodes of nausea or vomiting in the recovery room and on the ward 24 h postoperatively, use of anti-emetics postoperatively, severity of nausea and patient satisfaction with the intervention. Our study revealed no significant differences in rates of postoperative nausea and vomiting between the intervention and standard therapy groups (41.4% v 36.9% p = 0.461). There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes between groups. Chewing gum does not reduce the incidence of PONV after elective LSCS under spinal anaesthesia. Our trial was registered with clinicaltrials.org (NCT04191694)."

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Since tobacco contains numerous harmful substances, besides nicotine, which is addictive, smoking cessation products and tobacco alternatives, such as electronic (e-) cigarettes, nicotine chewing gums, and patches, are being widely used. Nicotine gums are consumed orally. The nicotine from the gum is absorbed at a slower rate than that from e-cigarettes, and the former remains in the bloodstream for a longer period. In addition, the maximum number of daily doses is high, and it can be purchased without a doctor's prescription in many countries. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 29-year-old male patient consumed 5 2-mg nicotine gums at a time, twice a day, for 4 days (total amount: 70 mg). However, he visited the emergency unit with the chief complaint of involuntary limb movements after consuming an additional 15 gums 3 hour before the visit. At admission, his consciousness was clear, although 2 hour later, he experienced sudden loss of consciousness with worsening hypoxia and respiratory acidosis. DIAGNOSIS: The patient's vital signs were stable at the time of admission, and blood test results showed no specific findings other than a white blood cell count of 14,800/µL, lactate level of 6.4 mmol/L, and prolactin level of 119.02 ng/mL. In addition, chest radiography and head computed tomography scans showed no acute phase abnormalities. Two hours later, he experienced loss of consciousness and respiratory failure, and the results of blood tests performed at this time showed that his blood cotinine level was 3491 ng/mL. INTERVENTIONS: Supportive treatment, including endotracheal intubation followed by mechanical ventilation, was provided. OUTCOME: The patient's vital signs stabilized 3 days after treatment, and his consciousness and respiratory status had improved; therefore, mechanical ventilation was stopped. His condition was stable for the next 2 days, and he was discharged on the fifth day. LESSONS: Acute respiratory exacerbation due to nicotine poisoning (from levels exceeding the lethal dose of 30-60 mg) was observed, although the gums were consumed over several days. Patients with nicotine poisoning may show acute respiratory failure and should be monitored carefully. Further studies are required to determine the toxic effects of nicotine replacement therapies.",

METHODS: In this study, 57 patients, having a 3-6 mm maxillary dental crowding and non-extraction treatment modality were includ- ed. The pressure pain thresholds of the subjects were measured. Patients were distributed equally by sex and randomly allocated into 3 groups: mechanical vibration, chewing gum, and control. The fixed orthodontic treatment was started in the upper jaw only. In the first and second groups, mechanical vibration was applied and sugar-free gum was chewed, respectively. The third group was used as the control. The pain perceptions were measured using the Visual Analog Scale. Kruskal-Wallis and Friedman tests were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The groups were similar at the beginning of the study in terms of age and algometer scores (P = .138 and P =.155, respective- ly). Statistical significant differences in the Visual Analog Scale scores among the groups could not be detected at any time point. The highest pain scores were detected at the 24th hour of treatment in all 3 groups. There was no statistically significant difference in the highest pain level among the groups (P = .279). CONCLUSION: Although the average pain values were perceived as lower, particularly in the mechanical vibration group, the temporary displacement of the teeth has no clinically significant pain relief effect on orthodontic pain."

      "abstract": "Chewing gum residue is hard to decompose and easy to cause pollution, which is highly desirable to realize recycling. In this paper, a chewing gum gel with enhanced mechanical properties and self-healing properties is prepared by using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as the backbone in chewing gum residue. The hydrogen bond and the borax ester bond are employed to construct reversible interaction to enhance the self-healing ability. The physical crosslinking is realized by further freeze-thaw treatment to improve its mechanical properties. The gel demonstrates high elongation at break of 610% and strength of 0.11 MPa, as well as excellent self-healing performance and recyclable properties. In particular, the gel with a fast signal response is successfully applied as a wearable strain sensor to monitor different types of human motion. The gel as a sensor exhibits self-healing properties suggesting superior safety and stability, and displays wide linear sensitivity (the gauge factor is 0.417 and 0.170). The gel can be further served to explore temperature changes, implying the application in temperature monitoring. This study develops a novel approach for the recycle and reuse of chewing gum residue. The obtained gel may be a promising candidate for the fabrication of flexible wearable sensor.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pain during fixed orthodontic treatment can have a detrimental effect on patient treatment compliance. To overcome this, there is a definite need to establish the best pain-relieving methods suitable for orthodontic patients in terms of efficacy and use. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of chewing gum and pre-emptive tenoxicam on pain after initial archwire placement and to evaluate the pain perceptions of orthodontic patients in the two groups while performing various functions at specific time intervals. METHODS: Forty-two patients were selected and randomly divided into two groups: group A (chewing gum) and group B (pre-emptive tenoxicam). Pain perception was documented by patients immediately; at 4 h; at bedtime on the day of archwire placement; the next morning; at 24 h; and at bedtime on the 2nd, 3rd, and 7th day after the initial archwire placement. Pain scores were noted during fitting of the posterior teeth, biting, and chewing using a visual analog scale. The data obtained were subjected to statistical analysis. RESULTS: Group A showed a significant increase in pain until the next morning while fitting the posterior teeth, biting, and chewing [36.2, 52.0, 33.4, respectively]], followed by a gradual decrease by the 7th day. Group B showed a significant increase in pain at bedtime on biting, with a peak value of 47.5. Pain on chewing, fitting posterior teeth, peaked the morning of the next day (100.0, 45.0). The Freidman test showed a statistically significant difference with a p-value of < 0.01. Higher pain scores were observed while chewing and biting compared with that while fitting the posterior teeth in both groups. The overall comparison of pain control between the two groups was not statistically significant [P > 0.05] between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Chewing gum was not inferior to pre-emptive tenoxicam. Thus, chewing gum is a non-pharmacological alternative to analgesics for orthodontic pain control that eliminates the chance of adverse reactions and can be used in the absence of adult observation."

METHODS: The systematic review [registered on PROSPERO 2018 (CRD42018094676)] included studies on adults and children with chewing of SFG as the main intervention, where \"sugar\" referred to monosaccharides and disaccharides. Included studies were in English and corresponded to primary research published between 1946 and 2020. The search conducted spanned all relevant databases using both Medical Subject Headings (MESH) and free text with combinations of \"chewing gum,\" \"sugar-free,\" \"caries,\" \"xerostomia,\" \"periodontal disease.\" RESULTS: Eight articles included plaque quantity as part of their outcomes. Meta-analysis showed that SFG significantly reduced plaque quantity (effect size-0.778; 95% CI-1.167 to-0.39). The correlation between the baseline and the end of study data was assumed to be 0.95 for the control and 0.65 for the SFG group. A sensitivity analysis was conducted with the pre- to post-test correlation, set at 0.95 for the SFG group. This gave an effect size of-1.098 (95% CI-1.539 to-0.656) with I 2 = 89.73%. When looking more specifically at xylitol gum, the results of the meta-analysis showed that it significantly reduced plaque quantity (effect size-0.743; 95% CI-1.148 to-0.338). There was a high degree of heterogeneity between studies with I 2 = 86.0%. CONCLUSION: There is some evidence that chewing sugar-free gum, in particular xylitol SFG, reduces the quantity of plaque in the oral cavity in comparison to non SFG chewing or no chewing controls. Further research with improved design, lengthier timeframes and higher number of participants should be considered.

Previously published case reports and studies have noted sleep-disordered breathing in patients with ROHHAD syndrome. Nocturnal respiratory manifestations, which if untreated early by respiratory support, may cause cardiorespiratory arrest and a life-threatening condition. More recently, it has been recognized that children with ROHHAD syndrome have central pauses during wakefulness associated with intermittent oxygen desaturations. We report novel findings of a child with ROHHAD syndrome displaying an irregular breathing pattern and significant central pauses associated with oxygen desaturations during wakefulness, whose respiratory status improved while chewing gum.

METHODS: Following the PRISMA statement, PubMed, CINAHL, Google Scholar, Cochrane Review Database, EMBASE, Scopus, and grey literature were searched for evidence. FINDINGS: The analysis included 2 trials with 100 patients. Compared to placebo, chewing gum resulted in faster recovery of bowel function (mean difference [MD], -16.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], -18.67 to -13.32; P < .00001). In addition, chewing gum decreased the time to flatus (MD, -14.81; 95% CI, -22.14 to -7.47; P < .0001), but did not reduced the length of stay (MD, 0.97; 95% CI, -1.23 to 3.18; P = .39) and the incidence of postoperative ileus (risk ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.20-2.23; P = .51).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CENTRAL databases were searched up to February 2021 to identify randomized controlled trials, involving adults, comparing antiplaque and anti-inflammatory effects of SFCG, with different active ingredients, as adjunctive to mechanical control of biofilm, with a minimum of 7-day of follow-up. Plaque and gingival indexes were assessed. The risk of bias assessment was performed with the RoB 2.0 tool. NMA, and pairwise meta-analyses were performed for both dental plaque and gingival indexes. RESULTS: Twelve studies were included, comprising 850 (antiplaque) and 1459 (gingival inflammation) subjects randomized into 9 interventions: (1) chlorhexidine; (2) chlorhexidine + xylitol (CHX+Xyl); (3) green tea + xylitol (GT+Xyl); (4) magnolia; (5) Lactobacillus reuteri; (6) vitamin C + xylitol; (7) vitamin + carbamide; (8) eucalyptus; and (9) negative control, sorbitol, gum base only, or no chewing gum. No statistically significant differences were detected among SFCG, with different active ingredients, for both antiplaque and anti-inflammatory efficacy (p > 0.05). However, SFCG with GT+XyL outperformed negative control gums regarding antiplaque efficacy (SMD, - 2.93; 95% CrI, - 0.45 to - 5.38). The SUCRA results showed that SFCG containing GT+Xyl was ranked first, for both antiplaque and anti-inflammatory outcomes. CONCLUSION: SFCG containing GT+Xyl showed better antiplaque effect over negative controls. However, cautious interpretation is required due to the low number of direct comparisons arms. These shortcomings underscore the need for RCTs with mostly head-to-head comparison that provide more conclusive evidence. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: There is no robust evidence for the clinical indications of sugar-free chewing gums as adjunct to toothbrushing for the control of biofilm or the treatment of gingivitis.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total number of 96 high caries risk geriatric patients were randomized into two equal groups (n=48). Group 1 (intervention group) received probiotic yogurt (Activia, Danone) once per day, and group 2 (control group) received xylitol chewing gum (Trident original) three times per day. The primary outcome was salivary Streptococcus mutans count and secondary outcomes were interdental plaque Streptococcus mutans count, salivary pH and bacterial adherence. RESULTS: For Streptococcus mutans count in saliva and plaque, a statistically significant reduction in the level of MS over all the examined follow up periods of the study in probiotic yogurt group as well as xylitol gum group was found. An intergroup comparison for salivary MS count showed statistically significant difference between the two materials in a two week and a three month period of time and there was no statistically significant difference between both materials at one month time period. Salivary pH results showed statistically significant increase in pH in both groups along the follow-up periods. Bacterial adherence results showed statistically significant reduction in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic yogurt is an effective antibacterial agent against salivary and plaque bacteria in geriatric patients."

METHODS: The study enrolled 106 patients of both sexes, aged ≥ 12 years, with body weight > 50 kg, and mild-to-moderate dental crowding in the upper arch. After randomization and allocation concealment, the intervention groups were either administered with ibuprofen (400 mg) or acetaminophen (500 mg) or chewed sugar-free chewing gum immediately after initial archwire placement and every 6 hours for 1 week if the pain persisted. The control group did not receive any pain relief. The pain was assessed on a 100-mm visual analog scale at rest and while biting down at T1 (2 hours), T2 (24 hours), T3 (2 days), T4 (3 days), T5 (7 days), and T6 (21 days). Statistical analyses were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis and post-hoc Mann-Whitney U tests (α = 0.05). RESULTS: The chewing gum group experienced more pain relief than the ibuprofen group at while biting down at T3 (p = 0.04) and at rest at T4 (p < 0.001). The chewing gum group reported more pain relief than the acetaminophen and control groups while biting down at T3 (p = 0.03 and p = 0.0006, respectively) and T4 (both p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Chewing gum can be a non-pharmacological alternative for orthodontic pain relief at 2 and 3 days after initial archwire placement."

METHODS: Patients with 3-6 mm maxillary crowding who planned to receive non-extraction orthodontic treatment were recruited for the study. Sixty-three participants (33 females and 30 males) were randomly allocated into three groups: laser, chewing gum, and control. In the laser group, a gallium aluminum arsenide (GaAlAs) diode laser with a wavelength of 820 nm was used to apply a single dose immediately after orthodontic treatment began. In the chewing gum group, sugar-free gum was chewed three times for 20 minutes- immediately after starting treatment, and at the twenty-fourth and forty-eighth hours of treatment. Pain perception was measured using a visual analog scale at the second, sixth, and twenty-fourth hours, and on the second, third, and seventh days. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the groups at any measured time point (p > 0.05). The highest pain scores were detected at the twenty-fourth hour of treatment in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of the study, we could not detect whether low-level laser therapy and chewing gum had any clinically significant effect on orthodontic pain. Different results may be obtained with a higher number of participants or using lasers with different wavelengths and specifications. Although the study had a sufficient number of participants according to statistical analysis, higher number of participants could have provided more definitive outcomes."

      "abstract": "We aimed to investigate the efficacy of chewing gum on bowel movements after minimally invasive gynaecologic surgery, total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH). The study was designed as a prospective randomised controlled study. We divided the patients into two groups regarding postoperative chewing gum after elective TLH operation. The demographic status and characteristics of the patients as well as, anaesthesia and operation records were obtained. The study group was asked to chew gum for 15 min in an hour starting from post-operative 4th hour until the patient passed flatus. In each patient, first auscultation of bowel sounds, first flatus and first defaecation time, as well as first mobilisation time and discharge time, were recorded. We compared the difference in abdominal distension, nausea and vomiting and post-operative ileus (POI) rates. Eight patients were excluded from the study due to matching with exclusion criteria. The remaining 126 patients were divided into two groups. First bowel sounds, first bowel movements, the timing of first gas discharge and the timing of the first defaecation was found significantly earlier in the given-chewing gum group (p < .001). The timing of patient discharge and POI were found to be similar in each group (p > .05). Mild symptoms of ileus were observed in two patients (3.2%) in the not given-chewing gum group and three patients (5.5%) in the given-chewing gum group. The symptoms were better tolerated by the patients who chew gums and no side effects regarding the treatment were observed. In post-operative patient care after minimally invasive surgery, chewing gum has a beneficial effect on bowel movements. This inexpensive and well-tolerated procedure ameliorates gastrointestinal (GI) functions, whereas it has little benefit on early mobilisation and timing of the patient discharge after patients undergoing TLH.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? There are many studies in the literature on the effect of gum on postoperative bowel movements, early mobilisation and short-term hospitalisation. However, there are still doubts about its use after minimally invasive surgery, especially in gynaecology practice.What do the results of this study add? Chewing gum after surgery is a well-tolerated, effective, safe, easy and convenient method and is easily accepted by patients. Its use by gynaecologists after TLH is still not clear. Our aim is to show the relationship between chewing gum and TLH with this study; We believe that early mobilisation after laparoscopic hysterectomy will not be of significant benefit after minimally invasive gynaecological surgeries as it is not significantly effective in early nutrition and early patient discharge.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Our statistically not significant results obtained in this study may change after conducting randomised prospective studies involving more patients. However, we believe that giving chewing-gum after laparoscopic hysterectomy will not have a significant benefit.",

      "abstract": "To uncover the potential benefits of discarded chewing gum (DCG) as a performance-enhancing modifier for road pavement applications, its influence on the asphalt binder's attributes was profoundly examined. The base AP-5 asphalt along with its specimens dosed with various fractions of DCG (e.g., 3, 6, and 9 wt%) were analyzed by Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thin-layer chromatography-flame ionization detection (TLC-FID), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Brookfield viscometer, ring and ball softening point, needle penetration, and dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) tests were adopted to inspect the physical and rheological changes of asphalt cement after DCG incorporation. FT-IR disclosed that the asphalt-gum interaction was not chemical but physical in nature, whilst XRD demonstrated the existence of talc filler in DCG, which may confer the bituminous mixes with exceptional engineering properties. Iatroscan analysis evinced that the gum treatment particularly altered the aromatic and resin fractions; meanwhile, the content of saturates and asphaltenes remained relatively unchanged. SEM divulged that the DCG has a complete dissolution within the bitumen matrix, which becomes rougher due to higher dose administration. AFM revealed that the steady gum introduction amplified the size of bee-like structures, shrunk their peri-phase domains, and wiped out the para-phase domains entirely. TGA/DTGA/DSC data highlighted that the high-temperature-stable additive slightly affected the thermal properties of blends. DSR and empirical rheological tests showed that the waste gum made the bitumen less vulnerable to heat and tender, thereby boosting its resistance against fatigue cracking at intermediate service temperatures. On top of that, DCG widened the thermal window of bitumen performance grade (PG), and preserved its viscosity at standard temperatures, leading to maintaining an appropriate workability for asphalt mix. In brief, the use of discarded chewing gum as an asphalt modifier is feasible and could mitigate plastic pollution and provide durable roadways by delivering superior performance."

Plant cells have been used to produce monoclonal antibodies or antimicrobial peptides for topical applications to decrease colonization of pathogenic microbes on dental surface. Therefore, we investigated an affordable method for dental biofilm disruption by expressing lipase, dextranase or mutanase in plant cells via the chloroplast genome. Antibiotic resistance gene used to engineer foreign genes into the chloroplast genome were subsequently removed using direct repeats flanking the aadA gene and enzymes were successfully expressed in marker-free lettuce transplastomic lines. Equivalent enzyme units of plant-derived lipase performed better than purified commercial enzymes against biofilms, specifically targeting fungal hyphae formation. Combination of lipase with dextranase and mutanase suppressed biofilm development by degrading the biofilm matrix, with concomitant reduction of bacterial and fungal accumulation. In chewing gum tablets formulated with freeze-dried plant cells, expressed protein was stable up to 3 years at ambient temperature and was efficiently released in a time-dependent manner using a mechanical chewing simulator device. Development of edible plant cells expressing enzymes eliminates the need for purification and cold-chain transportation, providing a potential translatable therapeutic approach. Biofilm disruption through plant enzymes and chewing gum-based delivery offers an effective and affordable dental biofilm control at home particularly for populations with minimal oral care access.",

      "abstract": "Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders. Its pathophysiology is diverse and variable, involving disturbed gut-brain interactions, altered motility and secretion, visceral hypersensitivity, increased intestinal permeability, immune activation, and changes in gut microbiota. Complaints experienced by patients suffering from IBS and its co-morbidities strongly impair quality of life (QoL), and available treatments are often unsatisfactory. Anecdotal reports and preclinical data suggest that the endocannabinoid system and functionally related mechanisms could offer treatment targets. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a candidate agent of interest with a broad molecular target profile and the absence of psychoactive properties. Materials and Methods: In 32 female IBS patients, we explored the effect of a chewing gum formulation containing 50 mg CBD on abdominal pain and perceived well-being in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over trial. Chewing gums were used on-demand guided by pain symptoms with a maximum of six per day. Pain intensity was assessed by a visual analogue scale (scale 0.0-10.0), and QoL was evaluated with the IBS-36 questionnaire. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in pain scores between CBD and placebo at a group level. Subgroup and individual analyses showed a highly variable picture. No indications were found for symptom-driven intake, which also remained lower than expected overall. Conclusions: With the current design, based on the assumption that IBS patients would adjust their intake to their perceived symptom relief, no differences at the group level were found between CBD and placebo gum in pain scores and the number of gums used. The low use of the gums also indicates that the benefits experienced by these patients generally did not outweigh practical disadvantages such as prolonged chewing throughout the day. The very high intra- and inter-individual variation in IBS symptoms warrant future trials that are more personalized, for example by applying an N-of-1 (rotating) design with individualized dose titration.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preventive strategies targeting Streptococcus mutans may be effective in reducing the global burden of caries. The aim of the current systematic review of published literature was to determine the difference in level of Streptococcus mutans in adults and children who chew sugar-free gum (SFG), compared with those who did not chew gum, who chewed a control gum or received alternatives such as probiotics or fluoride varnish. METHODS: Systematic review (PROSPERO registration No. CRD42018094676) of controlled trials with adult and child participants where chewing of SFG was the main intervention. Databases searched (1 Jan 1946 to 31 August 2020): MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, Allied and Complimentary Medicine Database, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Open Grey, PROSPERO and the Cochrane library of systematic reviews. 'Search terms included Medical Subject Headings, and free text to cover the following range of constructs: chewing gum, sugar free, oral health, caries, xerostomia, periodontal disease. Data extraction and Risk of Bias assessment was undertaken by three researchers using a modified version of the Cochrane RoB tool (version 1). Data synthesis was conducted using meta-analysis in STATA. RESULTS: Thirteen studies of SFG with micro-organisms as outcomes were identified. The use of SFG significantly reduced the load of Streptococcus mutans (effect size - 0.42; 95% CI - 0.60 to - 0.25) compared to all controls. In seven of the 13 studies the confidence intervals of the effect size estimate included zero, suggesting no effect of the intervention. Twelve trials used xylitol gum only as the basis of the intervention; xylitol gum significantly reduced the load of Streptococcus mutans (effect size - 0.46; 95% CI - 0.64 to - 0.28) in comparison to all controls. There was a moderate level of heterogeneity across the included studies. No adverse effects were recorded. CONCLUSION: Chewing SFG reduces the load of Streptococcus mutans in the oral cavity in comparison to non-chewing controls. Considering the degree of variability in the effect and the moderate quality of the trials included, there is a need for future research exploring the use SFG as a preventive measure for reducing the cariogenic oral bacterial load.",

      "abstract": "Background/Aim: Chewing gum throughout small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) increases completion rates (CRs) but decreases small bowel transit time (SBTT) and diagnostic yield (DY). We determined the effects of chewing gum early during SBCE on gastric transit time (GTT), SBTT, CR, DY, and gastroscopy intervention. Methods: We prospectively enrolled patients (ages 16-80 years) undergoing SBCE between January and June 2019. Patients were randomized to a chewing gum group (103 patients) and a control group (102 patients). Patients in the former group chewed one piece of gum for ~15 min every 30 min during the first hour of SBCE. Two gastroenterologists blinded to the study group examined the data. Results: GTT was shorter in the chewing gum group (19.0 min, interquartile range: 17.0-52.0 min) than in the control group [42.5 min (23.25-60 min); P = 0.01]. SBTT was similar in the two groups [318.5 min (239.5-421.3 min) vs. 287.0 min (216.0-386.0 min); P = 0.08]. Gastroscopy rate was lower in the chewing gum group (15.53 vs. 32.35%, P = 0.005). CR (95.15 vs. 89.22%, P = 0.114) and DY (66.02 vs. 59.80%, P = 0.359) did not differ between the groups. The number of abnormal-lesion types detected per patient was higher in the chewing gum group [1.0 (0.0-2.0) vs. 2.0 (0.0-2.0); P = 0.049]. Conclusions: Chewing gum early during SBCE significantly reduced GTT and gastroscopy intervention, with no influence on SBTT (Trial number: NCT03815136)."

This single-arm study, which started with a 4-week control and ended with a 4-week intervention period, was conducted in two phases: one in 2017 and one in 2018. The participants comprised 36 dental hygiene students (17 in 2017, 19 in 2018). During the intervention period, all participants were required to chew a piece of gum base 7 times a day for 10 min each time. The unstimulated salivary flow rate and masticatory efficiency were measured and chewing number counted. Two questionnaires －the Profile of Mood States, second edition (POMS2) and the 30-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-30)－ were administered to assess mental health. In both phases, the unstimulated salivary flow rate showed a significant increase after the intervention period (p<0.05). In 2017, the GHQ-30 scores and masticatory efficiency showed a tendency toward a negative correlation after the intervention period (r=－0.4647, p=0.06). In 2018, a significant negative correlation was observed between chewing number and the POMS2 scores after the intervention period (r=－0.6296, p<0.01). These findings suggest that frequent chewing of gum base increases unstimulated salivary flow rate. However, no significant change was observed in the mental health.",

The use of non-pharmacological therapies can make the childbirth process a pleasurable event for the mother. This study aimed to compare the effects of watching virtual reality videos and chewing gum on the length of delivery stages and maternal satisfaction. METHODS: This clinical trial study was performed on 93 women with first and second pregnancies, who were referred to Allameh Bohlool Hospital in Gonabad and Sajjadieh Hospital in Torbat-e-Jam, Iran, for childbirth between 2018 and 2019. Pregnant women were randomly assigned to three groups of chewing gum, virtual reality, and control. Interventions were performed twice: in the active (dilation of 4-5 cm) and second (dilation of 7-8 cm) phases of parturition for 20 minutes each. Data were collected using data-gathering forms, including a demographic characteristics form, a midwifery characteristics form, and the Mackey Childbirth Satisfaction Rating Scale. The data were analyzed using SPSS, version 22, via the Chi square tests, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, and Tukey's post hoc tests. RESULTS: The difference in the mean maternal childbirth satisfaction score between the two intervention groups of virtual reality and chewing gum was not statistically significant (P=0.339), but the mean score in the intervention groups was higher than that of the control group (P<0.001(. There was no significant difference in the mean length of the active and second phases of parturition between the two intervention groups, but this value in the intervention groups was significantly lower than that of the control group. CONCLUSION: The thought divergence interventions of chewing gum and watching virtual reality videos enhanced childbirth satisfaction, and curtailed parturition stages in our sample of pregnant women.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present double-blind randomised clinical trial with the trial registration number of IRCT20190724044319N1 was conducted on 36 dental students. The volunteers were, randomly, divided into two groups (n = 18) including: G1: intervention group (chitosan chewing gum) and G2: control group (placebo chewing gum). Each participant was given eight pieces of the chewing gum, and was asked to chew each gum piece for 5 min and this was repeated for eight times. Their Saliva was collected before and after chewing gums and the number of S. mutans colonies and salivary pH were determined. Data were analysed using SPSS (ver.21) and independent student t test. p Value less than .05 was set as significant. RESULTS: There was significant difference between two groups for the number of salivary S. mutans colonies (3.31*105  in the intervention group compared to 13.94*105 in the Control group) (p < .001). The salivary pH evaluation showed that salivary pH mean value in intervention group was not significant in compared with control group (p = .17). However, the chitosan chewing gum led to an increase in salivary pH by 0.17, which was statistically significant (p = .01). CONCLUSION: Results of this study showed that chitosan chewing gum has a positive effect on the reduction of numbers of salivary S. mutans colonies but had no considerable effect on the increase of salivary pH.",

METHODS: Seventy-one (71) individuals with CHF on oral loop diuretics were randomised to chewing gum (n=36) or control (n=35) for 2 weeks. Both groups were assessed for their level of thirst at Days 1-4, 7, 14 and 28. RESULTS: Significant improvements in the level of thirst of those who received chewing gum compared to the control group at Day 4 (p=0.04) and Day 14 (p=0.02) were observed. CONCLUSION: Chewing gum provided relief from thirst in the short-term and in the longer term. This trial provides important information to inform future clinical trials on ways to relieve thirst.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of chewing gum on dry mouth, interdialytic weight gain, and intradialytic symptoms in hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: This prospective randomized controlled single-blind study was conducted with patients who had been treated for at least 6 months with sessions 3 days a week for 4 hours at two HD units. Patients were randomly allocated to chewing gum group or the control group. In the chewing gum group, gum was chewed for 10 minutes six times a day, and when the patients felt mouth dryness or were thirsty. In the nonchewing gum group, gum was not chewed. The patients were followed-up for 3 months. A total of three saliva samples were taken before starting treatment at the first, 12th, and 36th HD session. Data were collected with the \"Visual Analogue Scale (VAS),\" \"Hemodialysis Patients Fluid Control Scale,\" \"Dialysis Symptom Index,\" and \"Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale\" at baseline, week 4, week 8, and week 12. FINDINGS: The study was completed with a total of 44 patients consisting of 22 patients in the each group. The second and third month VAS values (xerostomia) of the patients in the chewing gum groups were statistically significantly lower than those in the control group (P = 0.014, P < 0.001, respectively). The third month salivary flow rate in the chewing gum group was higher than the values in the control group patients (P < 0.001). DISCUSSION: It is anticipated that this study will raise nurses' awareness of dry mouth and encourage future studies on interventions to increase the salivary flow rate to prevent or treat dry mouth.",

Discrepancies between reviewers were resolved by a third reviewer.Data extraction and synthesis Data was extracted from included studies using a standardised form. Three summary measures were calculated: prevented fraction (PF); standardised mean difference (SMD); and standardised effect size (ES). Where concerns about incomplete data were encountered, authors were contacted to provide clarification; if data was not able to be completed, the study was excluded.Results Following screening, 38 selected manuscripts explored the impact of sugar-free gum (SFG) across all aspects of oral health. From this, data was extracted from 12 studies with dental caries outcomes included; of these, eight explored xylitol gum as the intervention and were analysed separately. A significant reduction in caries incidence was found with the use of SFGs - PF of 28% (95%CI 7%-48%). In the eight trials that used xylitol-only gum as the basis of the intervention, the PF increased to 33% (95% CI 4%-61%). No adverse effects were recorded. There was a high level of heterogeneity among the trials included.Conclusions The use of SFG was shown to have a significant, but tentative, effect in reducing the incidence of caries, compared to those who do not or use other sugar-free alternatives. The authors comment that a considerable degree of variability was noted between the trials reviewed. Further research is required in this field to provide robust empirical evidence.",

Furthermore, the study investigated the effect of chewing gum and plastic wafers on the frequency of orthodontic appliance breakage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 105 female patients aged 15-35 years, undergoing maxillary and mandibular fixed appliance treatment were classified randomly into three groups of 35 each. In each group, the patients were given one of the following treatments immediately after the placement of the first archwire, every 8 hours for 1 week as needed: ibuprofen (400 mg), or a viscoelastic bite wafer, or chewing gum. A visual analog scale was given to the patients to record their pain perception following initial archwire placement. In addition, the patients were asked to report any incidence of detached brackets while using the above methods. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found in pain perception at any time interval among the three groups. The pain experienced at bedtime and 24 hours after wire placement among different groups in the present study was found to be slightly higher with maximum intensity and the pain perception finding at different time intervals within each pain relief method was statistically significant (p = 0.000, p < 0.05). Furthermore, ANOVA results demonstrate no significant differences in bracket detachment between the groups (p = 0.20, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The use of bite wafers and chewing gum was effective and comparable to ibuprofen use for pain relief following the initial activation of fixed orthodontic appliances among Saudi orthodontic patients. In addition, the study found no clinically or statistically significant differences in bracket detachment between the groups. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The nondrug modalities of controlling pain such as chewing gum and/or bite wafers can be used as an alternative to ibuprofen use following the first activation of fixed orthodontic appliances.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Antimicrobial peptide, KSL-W, formulated as an antiplaque chewing gum (APCG), was tested to evaluate the dental plaque inhibition activity and safety in an IRB approved and FDA regulated 4-day plaque regrowth clinical study. METHODS: This Phase 2 two-armed placebo-controlled, double blind, randomized (1:1), multiple dose, and single-center study was evaluated in a proof of concept for the APCG containing 30 mg antimicrobial peptide KSL-W. Twenty six generally healthy subjects were consented and randomized into the study. The subjects were administered a dose three times per day for four treatment days following a complete dental prophylaxis. Participants were prohibited from conducting oral hygiene care (teeth brushing, flossing, and/or mouth wash rinse) for the duration of the trial. Twelve to 16 hr prior to the baseline visit, the subjects were to abstain from oral hygiene care. The Quigley-Hein Turesky plaque index (QHT) score and the oral soft tissue clinical exams were obtained at both Day 0 and Day 4. RESULTS: All randomized study subjects that received either APCG or placebo gum completed the study with no significant adverse events recorded. The APCG significantly inhibited the regrowth of dental plaque over the course of 4 days. The whole mouth data demonstrated a difference in the QHT between the APCG and the placebo gum of 1.14 (SE = 0.27) and 95% confidence bounds of 0.58, 1.70 with a two-tailed P value of .0003. CONCLUSION: Considering the limited sample size, the proof of concept analysis in this Phase 2 study confirmed that APCG is effective against dental plaque formation and safe for human use.

AIMS: To evaluate the long-term effects of simple oral exercise (SOE) and chewing gum exercise on mastication, salivation, and swallowing function in adults aged ≥ 65 years. METHODS: Ninety-six participants were assigned to control, SOE, and GOE (chewing gum exercise with SOE) groups. The SOE comprised exercises to improve mastication, salivation, and swallowing function. Control group participants performed no exercises. The intervention period was 8 weeks, followed by a 3-week maintenance period. The Mixing Ability Index (MAI), occlusal force, unstimulated saliva, and repetitive saliva swallowing test were evaluated at baseline and 2, 5, 8, and 11 weeks later. Self-reported discomfort was re-evaluated after 8 weeks. RESULTS: After 8 weeks, mean MAI differences from baseline significantly increased in both groups; the increase in the GOE group was largest and four times higher than in the control group. Mean differences of occlusal force from baseline increased by 56 N (SOE group) and 60 N (GOE group). The increase of salivation was greater in the SOE (3.6-fold) and GOE (2.2-fold) groups than in the control group. Furthermore, 27% and 18% of SOE and GOE group participants, respectively, were re-categorized as having good swallowing function. Participants reported less discomfort as oral functions improved. DISCUSSION: These findings may facilitate the development of clinical practice guidelines for optimal oral care in older adults. CONCLUSION: While both SOE and GOE may improve oral function in older adults, GOE is recommended for those with impaired mastication.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of postoperative gum-chewing compare with routine postoperative care on the recovery of gastrointestinal function after comprehensive surgical staging for gynecological cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 82 patients who underwent comprehensive surgical staging for gynecological cancer at Rajavithi Hospital between October 1st, 2018 and June 30th, 2019 were randomly allocated into two groups: Gum-chewing group (n=40) and control group (n=42). In the gum-chewing group, patients were assigned to chew sugar-free gum for 30 minutes starting from the first postoperative morning then every 8 hours until the first passage of flatus. In the control group, patients have received routine postoperative care. The primary endpoint was time to first flatus after surgery. The secondary endpoints were time to first bowel sound, time to first defecation, time to first walk, postoperative analgesia and anti-emetic drug requirement, ileus symptoms, length of a hospital stay, and potential adverse events of gum-chewing, including dry mount, choking, and aspiration. RESULT: Chewing gum was statistically significant in reducing time to first flatus compared with routine postoperative care (median 24.7 (range 2.2-86.5) vs 35.4 (range 7.2-80.9) hours, p=0.025). The length of a hospital stay was also significantly shorter in the gum-chewing group (median 3.0 (range 1.0-8.8) vs 3.5 (range 1.8-50.0) days, p=0.023). There were no significant differences in time to first bowel sound, time to first defecation, time to first walk, postoperative analgesia and anti-emetic drug requirement, and ileus symptoms between both two groups. No adverse events related to postoperative gum-chewing were observed. CONCLUSION: Gum-chewing was associated with early recovery of gastrointestinal function in patients undergoing surgery for gynecological cancer. It is an inexpensive and physiologic intervention that appears to be reasonably safe and should be recommended as an adjunct in postoperative care of gynecological cancer surgery.",

Although recognised by the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Society as one of the multimodal approaches to expedite recovery after surgery, strong evidence to support its use in routine postoperative practice is lacking. METHODOLOGY: A comprehensive literature review of all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was performed in the Medline and Embase databases between 2000 and 2019. Studies were selected to compare the use of chewing gum versus standard care in the management of postoperative ileus (POI) in adults undergoing colorectal surgery. The primary outcome assessed was the incidence of POI. Secondary outcomes included time to passage of flatus, time to defecation, total length of hospital stay and mortality. RESULTS: Sixteen RCTs were included in the systematic review, of which ten (970 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. The incidence of POI was significantly reduced in patients utilising chewing gum compared to those having standard care (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.39, 0.79, p = 0.0009). These patients also had a significant reduction in time to passage of flatus (WMD - 0.31, 95% CI - 0.36, - 0.26, p < 0.00001) and time to defecation (WMD - 0.47, 95% CI - 0.60, - 0.34, p < 0.00001), without significant differences in the total length of hospital stay or mortality. CONCLUSION: The use of chewing gum after colorectal surgery is a safe and effective intervention in reducing the incidence of POI and merits routine use alongside other ERAS pathways in the postoperative setting.",

AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare saliva fluoride concentration and flow rate after using Persica and sodium fluoride chewing gums. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: In a triple-blind crossover randomized trial, 44 healthy volunteers (21-25 year old) were recruited according to the inclusion criteria and were randomly allocated into two groups (22 each). PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: This study was performed within two sets of trial with a 10-day washout period. Participants (subjects) were followed a running period and matched for trial confounders. Saliva samples were collected under controlled conditions at similar time (11 am) within baseline, 5, 10, 20, and 45 min intervals preceded by 5-min chewing of Persica or sodium fluoride chewing gum. Saliva samples were analyzed for fluoride ion using hexamethyldisiloxane diffusion method. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Saliva flow rate (ml/min) and mean fluoride concentration (ppm) during different time periods in two types of gum were compared using ANOVA-repeated measures (P < 0.05). RESULTS: The difference in total means of stimulated saliva flow rates between two Persica and sodium fluoride gum intervention groups was statistically significant (P = 0.048); however, difference of fluoride concentrations was not statistically significant (P = 0.244). CONCLUSIONS: Chewing Persica containing gum released fluoride ions in saliva and increased saliva flow rate comparable with sodium fluoride chewing gum use as a gold standard."

METHODS: Systematic review of published literature. RESULTS: Twelve studies of interventions of SFG for dental caries outcomes were included. SFGs were found to significantly reduce caries increment, giving a preventative fraction (PF) of 28% (95% CI, 7% to 48%). Including the 8 trials that used xylitol gum only as the basis of the intervention, the PF was 33% (95% CI, 4% to 61%). No adverse effects were recorded. There was a high level of heterogeneity among the trials included. CONCLUSION: The findings of this review provide tentative evidence that chewing SFG reduces caries increment in comparison to nonchewing controls. However, there is a considerable degree of variability in the effect and the trials included were generally of moderate quality. There is a need for future research to explore the acceptability and feasibility of the use of SFG as a public health intervention (PROSPERO 2018 CRD42018094676). KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: The results of this study can be used by clinicians when deciding how best to implement dental caries prevention regimes for their patients. With consideration of cost and patient preference, this information could help to develop national policy directives on caries prevention and dictate the direction of future clinical research.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To determine if chewing gum containing casein phosphopeptide stabilised amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) promoted an increase in the abundance of Streptococcus sanguinis and other species associated with dental health in supragingival plaque in a clinical study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen participants were recruited for a three-leg cross-over, randomised, controlled clinical trial. Participants chewed a sugar-free gum with or without CPP-ACP six times daily for 20 min over two weeks. The study also involved no gum chewing (no gum) for the same two week period. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the test gums or no gum for each intervention period. Participants abstained from oral hygiene and had washout periods of two weeks between intervention periods. After each intervention period, supragingival plaque was collected and analysed for bacterial composition by sequencing the V4 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene. Data were analysed using a linear mixed model. RESULTS: The CPP-ACP gum intervention produced a significant (p < 0.01) increase in the proportions of S. sanguinis (112%), as well as the commensal species Rothia dentocariosa (127%), Corynebacterium durum (80%) and Streptococcus mitis (55%) when compared with the no gum intervention. All the species that were promoted by the CPP-ACP gum are known to possess one or both of the alkali-producing enzymes arginine deiminase and nitrate reductase. CONCLUSION: This clinical study demonstrated that chewing a sugar-free gum containing CPP-ACP promoted prebiosis by significantly increasing the proportion of S. sanguinis and other health-associated bacterial species in supragingival plaque. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Regular chewing of CPP-ACP sugar-free gum increases the proportions of health-associated commensal species in supragingival plaque to promote prebiosis and oral homeostasis.",

The primary clinical outcome was the variation in thirst intensity, evaluated by the Numeral Verbal Scale, and the secondary, the variation of the discomfort of thirst, evaluated by the Perioperative Thirst Discomfort Scale. Mann-Whitney test was used to compare measures between groups. The significance level adopted was of 0.05. RESULTS: menthol chewing gum significantly reduced the intensity (p <0.001), with Cohen's medium-effect d, and thirst discomfort (p <0.001), with a large-effect Cohen's d. CONCLUSION: menthol chewing gum was effective in reducing the intensity and discomfort of preoperative thirst. The strategy proved to be an innovative, feasible and safe option in the use for the surgical patient, in the management of the preoperative thirst, in elective surgeries. NCT: 03200197.",

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and gynaecological laparoscopy are a \"high volume\" procedure commonly performed in young females expecting rapid resumption of health.The aim of this study was to assess whether it was possible to improve patients' self-assessed quality of recovery in female patient undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy by simple perioperative measures in the form of a preoperative 200 ml nutritional drink and chewing gum during early recovery. METHODS: Patients were randomised to an active group receiving the intervention, and controls provided with standard care only. Patients were followed by questionnaire interviews preoperatively and at 2, 24 and 48 h after surgery. The Quality of Recovery scale (QoR) 15 items and 5 additional questions around gastro-intestinal symptoms were self-assessed by patients at each occasion. RESULT: Seventy-three ASA 1-2 female patients' undergoing elective laparoscopic surgery were included, surgery and anaesthesia was uneventful. The QoR score was significantly higher both at 24 and 48 h, 113 SD 20 vs 101 SD 25 (p = 0.026) and 123 SD 13 vs 111 SD 13 (p = 0.006) in the active group of patients as compared to controls.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Postoperative nausea, retching and vomiting (PONV) remains one of the most common side effects of general anaesthesia, contributing significantly to patient dissatisfaction, cost and complications. Chewing gum has potential as a novel, drug-free alternative treatment. We aim to conduct a large, definitive randomised controlled trial of the efficacy and safety of peppermint-flavoured chewing gum to treat PONV in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU). If chewing gum is shown to be as effective as ondansetron, this trial has the potential to significantly improve outcomes for tens of millions of surgical patients around the world each year. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a prospective, multicentre, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial. 272 female patients aged ≥12 years having volatile anaesthetic-based general anaesthesia for breast or laparoscopic surgery will be randomised. Patients experiencing nausea, retching or vomiting in PACU will be randomised to 15 min of chewing gum or 4 mg intravenous ondansetron. The primary outcome (complete response) is cessation of PONV within 2 hours of administration, with no recurrence nor rescue medication requirement for 2 hours after administration. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Chewy Trial has been approved by the Human Research Ethics Committees at all sites. Dissemination will be via international and national anaesthesia conferences, and publication in the peer-reviewed literature. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12618000429257; Pre-results.",

METHODS: Patients bonded with fixed appliances were randomly assigned to one of two groups (gum group [GG] or placebo group [PG]) and then followed for 10 days. The main outcome was a visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, and the secondary outcomes included patients' subjective assessments of overall pain level, the impact of pain on hygiene habits and treatment decision, and the frequency of analgesics consumption. Eighty kits (40 for GG and 40 for PG) were pre-randomized and concealed before patient enrollment using a computer-generated random sequence. Operators and patients were blinded. Data were analyzed using generalized linear models and Mann-Whitney U, chi-square, and Fisher exact tests. RESULTS: A total of 75 patients were allocated to intervention groups; 37 participated and completed diaries (20 in GG and 17 in PG). No statistically significant differences were detected between the GG and PG groups in any tested variable. Pain negatively affected some patients' oral hygiene practices. A mismatch existed between patient expectations and actual pain experiences. Female patients used analgesics more frequently than male patients (P = .046). CONCLUSION: Chewing gum three times per day does not seem to significantly reduce orthodontic pain compared to placebo. Orthodontists should manage their patients' pain expectations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pain and discomfort are main concerns at the commencement of orthodontic treatment. It may have negative impact on compliance or even discourage patients from being treated. Orthodontic pain can be alleviated by paracetamol or use of chewing gum. However, studies comparing their effectiveness are scarce. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness of paracetamol versus chewing gum for pain alleviation and to investigate the frequency of bracket loss during the first day of fixed orthodontic treatment. TRAIL DESIGN: Prospective randomized multicentre clinical trial. METHODS: Sixty patients (28 boys and 32 girls), between 12 and 18 years of age were randomly allocated either to take paracetamol (31 patients) or to use chewing gum (29 patients). After one arch bonding and insertion of the initial archwire, the patients rated the sensation of pain on a visual analogue scale with the jaw at rest and when biting after 6 hours (T1), at bedtime (T2), and the next morning (T3). Paracetamol (1000 mg) was taken 1 hour and chewing gum was used 10 minutes prior to pain rating at T2 and T3. A simple method of randomization was used in this study, and blinding of subjects and the operators to the type of intervention was not possible because of the nature of the treatments. RESULTS: There was no detectable difference in pain sensation between the groups at T1. At T2 and T3 the chewing gum group displayed higher mean values than the paracetamol group but when adjusting for age, gender, and mode of pain registration, there was no significant difference between the groups. There was no bracket loss in the chewing gum group, whereas two patients in the paracetamol group lost two brackets. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of chewing gum and paracetamol for initial orthodontic pain relief seems equivalent. Short term use of chewing gum is not a risk factor for bracket loss.

The objective of this study was to assess if coffee or chewing gum can increase excretion of the colon capsule within battery life time (excretion rate). METHODS: One hundred eighty six screening participants with a positive immunochemical fecal occult blood test were included in this single-centre randomized controlled trial with blinding of the investigators to the randomization. Participants received instant coffee, chewing gum or nothing in addition to the standard bowel preparation. RESULTS: The intention was to include 57 participants in the coffee group, 61 in the chewing gum group and 60 in the control group, on 8 participants data were missing. A total of 165 participants were included in a per protocol analysis. Exclusion was due to not receiving the allocated intervention (8 coffee, 4 chewing gum) and technical failure of the capsule (1 coffee). The excretion rate was 58% in the coffee group (n = 48), 63% in the chewing gum group (n = 57) and 55% in the control group (n = 60, p > 0.2). Transit times were similar in all groups. The excretion rate was low in participants who had transit times over 10 h (14%). A strong correlation was found between adequate cleansing and excretion of the capsule. There were no serious adverse events related to the interventions or CCE investigations. CONCLUSIONS: Chewing gum and coffee did not improve excretion rate in this study. An effect of chewing gum could not be proven, possibly due to sample size. Since chewing gum might improve excretion rates, is cheap and has no known side effects, it needs to be considered in future bowel preparation trials for CCE.

To the best of our knowledge this is the second study that aimed to evaluate the effect of chewing-gum as a sialagogue on the radioiodine content of salivary gland, and radioiodine-induced symptoms of salivary gland dysfunction. METHODS: Twenty-two patients who were referred to radioiodine therapy were randomized into chewing-gum (group A) and control (group B) groups. Anterior and posterior planar images including both head and neck were obtained 2, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the administration of radioiodine in all patients and round regions of interest (ROI) were drawn for both left and right parotid glands with a rectangular ROI in the region of cerebrum as the background. All patients were followed once, 6 months after radioiodine administration via a phone call for subjective evaluation of symptoms related to salivary gland damage. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the mean age, gender and initial iodine activity. The geometric mean of background-corrected count per administrated dose and acquisition time was calculated for bilateral parotid glands. This normalized parotid count showed a significant reduction in net parotid count in both groups during the first 48 hours after the radioiodine administration. However, no significant difference was found between the groups according to the amount and pattern of dose reduction in this time period. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that chewing-gum had no significant effect on the radioiodine content of parotid glands during the first 48 hours after radioiodine administration. Also, no significant difference was found in the incidence of relevant symptoms after 6 months comparing both groups.",

In this study, an examiner-blinded, randomized, and gum-base-controlled crossover manner was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a sugar-free chewing gum containing PE fruit extract in changing the oral microbiome. Twenty healthy young adults were randomly instructed to chew either PE gum or placebo gum. Saliva samples were collected at baseline and from 0 to 2, 2 to 5, 5 to 10, 10 to 15, and 75 to 80 min after each intervention. The following outcomes were measured: (i) salivary flow rate and pH value; (ii) total bacteria, Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) counts; and (iii) volatile sulfur compound (VSC) concentrations. The results showed similar data between groups at baseline and significantly higher salivary flow rates and pH levels in the PE fruit gum group after 0-2, 2-5, and 5-10 min of chewing. Assessment of total bacteria, S. mutans, P. gingivalis, and VSC levels revealed significant differences between the PE and control gum groups at 75-80 min. No adverse effects were registered. The present finding indicated chewing gum containing PE fruit extract stimulated salivary flow and significantly reduced clinical test indexes in the short term.

      "abstract": "Background: The oral cavity harbors a complex microbial ecosystem, intimately related to oral health and disease. The use of polyol-sweetened gum is believed to benefit oral health through stimulation of salivary flow and impacting oral pathogenic bacteria. Maltitol is often used as sweetener in food products. This study aimed to establish the in vivo effects of frequent consumption of maltitol-sweetened chewing gum on the dental plaque microbiota in healthy volunteers and to establish the cellular and molecular effects by in vitro cultivation and transcriptional analysis. Results: An intervention study was performed in 153 volunteers, randomly assigned to three groups (www.trialregister.nl; NTR4165). One group was requested to use maltitol gum five times daily, one group used gum-base, and the third group did not use chewing gum. At day 0 and day 28, 24 h-accumulated supragingival plaque was collected at the lingual sites of the lower jaw and the buccal sites of the upper jaw and analyzed by 16S ribosomal rRNA gene sequencing. At day 42, 2 weeks after completion of the study, lower-jaw samples were collected and analyzed. The upper buccal plaque microbiota composition had lower bacterial levels and higher relative abundances of (facultative) aerobic species compared to the lower lingual sites. There was no difference in bacterial community structure between any of the three study groups (PERMANOVA). Significant lower abundance of several bacterial phylotypes was found in maltitol gum group compared to the gum-base group, including Actinomyces massiliensis HOT 852 and Lautropia mirabilis HOT 022. Cultivation studies confirmed growth inhibition of A. massiliensis and A. johnsonii by maltitol at levels of 1% and higher. Transcriptome analysis of A. massiliensis revealed that exposure to maltitol resulted in changes in the expression of genes linked to osmoregulation, biofilm formation, and central carbon metabolism. Conclusion: The results showed that chewing itself only marginally impacted the plaque microbiota composition. Use of maltitol-sweetened gum lowered abundance of several bacterial species. Importantly, the species impacted play a key role in the early formation of dental biofilms. Further studies are required to establish if frequent use of maltitol gum impacts early dental-plaque biofilm development."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study compared xylitol gum plus oral health education (intervention group, n = 93) with oral health education alone (control group, n = 81) among students aged 7-18 years in special needs schools in Khon Kaen, Thailand. The primary outcome was caries onset rate measured as the change in caries onset on tooth surfaces. The secondary outcome was plaque index. Between-group differences were determined using generalised estimated equations and a general linear model under the intention-to-treat approach. RESULTS: After 1 year, there was a significantly lower caries rate in the primary dentition among the intervention group compared to the control group (0.08 vs 0.12 surfaces per surface-year, respectively; adjusted relative risk = 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.44-0.96; p = 0.03), but there was no significant difference in the caries rates for the permanent dentition. Remineralisation also occurred more in the intervention vs the control group in the primary dentition only. Oral hygiene was significantly improved in the intervention but not in the control group (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: This programme reduced the caries rate and enhanced remineralisation in primary dentition, and improved oral hygiene in students with disabilities.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Reducing the use of antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections is needed to limit the global threat of antibiotic resistance. We estimated the effectiveness of probiotics and xylitol for the management of pharyngitis. METHODS: In this parallel-group factorial randomized controlled trial, participants in primary care (aged 3 years or older) with pharyngitis underwent randomization by nurses who provided sequential intervention packs. Pack contents for 3 kinds of material and advice were previously determined by computer-generated random numbers: no chewing gum, xylitol-based chewing gum (15% xylitol; 5 pieces daily) and sorbitol gum (5 pieces daily). Half of each group were also randomly assigned to receive either probiotic capsules (containing 24 × 109 colony-forming units of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria) or placebo. The primary outcome was mean self-reported severity of sore throat and difficulty swallowing (scale 0-6) in the first 3 days. We used multiple imputation to avoid the assumption that data were missing completely at random. RESULTS: A total of 1009 individuals consented, 934 completed the baseline assessment, and 689 provided complete data for the primary outcome. Probiotics were not effective in reducing the severity of symptoms: mean severity scores 2.75 with no probiotic and 2.78 with probiotic (adjusted difference -0.001, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.24 to 0.24). Chewing gum was also ineffective: mean severity scores 2.73 without gum, 2.72 with sorbitol gum (adjusted difference 0.07, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.37) and 2.73 with xylitol gum (adjusted difference 0.01, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.30). None of the secondary outcomes differed significantly between groups, and no harms were reported.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To analyze the influence of increasing the average consumption of sugar-free gum (SFG) in 25 industrialized countries on dental expenditures due to caries by the national health care systems. It was assumed that large cost savings were possible, because the regular consumption of SFG significantly reduces the relative risk of caries and therefore, improves dental health, which reduces expenditures on dental treatments. METHODS: A budget impact analysis (BIA) was performed to model the decrease in the relative risk of caries and the subsequent cost savings for dental care. Annual consumption of SFG, dental expenditures due to caries, chewing frequencies by age groups and the relative risk reduction for caries due to the consumption of SFG were identified and used as model parameters. Three different scenarios for the increase in the number of SFG were calculated. Besides overall results for all countries together, analyses were conducted for countries grouped by regions and the Human Development Index (HDI). RESULTS: For the entity of all 25 analyzed countries together, possible annual cost savings range from US$805.77 M in the scenario with the lowest increase of SFG consumption up to US$18,248 billion in the scenario with the biggest increase of SFG consumption. Europe and the USA show potential cost savings of US$1,061 billion and US$2,071 billion per year, respectively, if all chewers increase their consumption of SFG by 1 piece per day. The analysis showed the potential cost savings in dental expenditures due to caries that can be achieved by only slightly increasing the consumption of SFG. The regular consumption of SFG cannot replace good dental hygiene like tooth brushing, but can have a significant impact on dental health, which can lead to increased cost savings for health care systems worldwide. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Based on the fact that a regular consumption of sugar-free chewing gum has the beneficial effect of reducing caries prevalence, an increased consumption may not only lead to improved dental health but significant cost savings in expenditures for dental treatment worldwide.",

The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of assessing masticatory performance using colour-changeable chewing gum and to investigate masticatory performance-related factors in preschool children. This cross-sectional survey was conducted in two childcare facilities and our laboratory. First, a one-third quantity of colour-changeable chewing gum was masticated by six adults to assess the nature and progression of colour changes in this quantity. Then, masticatory performance in 370 children 4-6 years of age was assessed using the same quantity of colour-changeable chewing gum (60 chew strokes). The maximum bite force, body height, weight, age and number of healthy teeth were recorded. A t-test was performed to determine whether gum-chewing experience or lack thereof produced a significant difference in masticatory performance. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was then determined for masticatory performance assessment values and other factors solely for children with gum-chewing experience. Measurements from 259 children were obtained. Children with gum-chewing experience demons trated significantly higher assessment values and were deemed to have been correctly assessed. A very weak but significant positive correlation was observed only between masticatory performance and the number of healthy teeth. The masticatory performance of preschool children was easily assessed using colour-changeable chewing gum. The assessment values demonstrated significant correlation with the number of healthy teeth, but not with maximum bite force, body height, weight or age.",

PPOI increases discomfort, morbidity and hospitalisation length, and is mainly caused by an inflammatory response following intestinal manipulation. This response can be weakened by targeting the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, with nicotine as essential regulator. Chewing gum, already known to stimulate gastrointestinal motility itself, combined with nicotine is hypothesised to improve gastrointestinal recovery and prevent PPOI. This pilot study is the first to assess efficacy and safety of nicotine gum in colorectal surgery. METHODS: Patients undergoing elective oncological colorectal surgery were enrolled in this double-blind, parallel-group, controlled trial and randomly assigned to a treatment protocol with normal or nicotine gum (2 mg). Patient reported outcomes (PROMS), clinical characteristics and blood samples were collected. Primary endpoint was defined as time to first passage of faeces and toleration of solid food for at least 24 h. RESULTS: In total, 40 patients were enrolled (20 vs. 20). In both groups, six patients developed PPOI. Time to primary endpoint (4.50 [3.00-7.25] vs. 3.50 days [3.00-4.25], p = 0.398) and length of stay (5.50 [4.00-8.50] vs. 4.50 days [4.00-6.00], p = 0.738) did not differ significantly between normal and nicotine gum. There were no differences in PROMS, inflammatory parameters and postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: We proved nicotine gum to be safe but ineffective in improving gastrointestinal recovery and prevention of PPOI after colorectal surgery. Other dosages and administration routes of nicotine should be tested in future research.",

METHODS: All randomized controlled trials comparing the use of chewing gum in the immediate postoperative recovery period (i.e. intervention group) with a control group were included in the meta-analysis. The primary outcome was the time to first flatus in hours. Meta-analysis was performed using the random effects model of DerSimonian and Laird, to produce summary treatment effects in terms of mean difference (MD) or relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Seventeen trials, including 3041 women, were analyzed. Trials were of moderate to low quality with different inclusion criteria. In most of the included trials chewing gum was given right after delivery, three times a day for 30 min each and until the first flatus. Women who were randomized to the chewing gum group had a significantly lower mean time to first flatus (MD - 6.49 h, 95%CI -8.65 to -4.33), to first bowel sounds (MD - 8.48 h, 95%CI -9.04 to -7.92), less duration of stay (MD - 0.39 days, 95%CI -0.78 to -0.18), lower time to first feces (MD - 9.57 h, 95% CI -10.28 to 8.87) and to the first feeling of hunger (MD - 2.89 h, 95%CI -4.93 to -0.85), less number of episodes of nausea or vomiting (RR 0.33, 95%CI 0.12 to 0.87), less incidence of ileus (RR 0.39, 95%CI 0.19 to 0.80) and significantly higher satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Gum chewing starting right after cesarean delivery three times a day for about 30 min until the first flatus is associated with early recovery of bowel motility. As this is a simple, generally inexpensive intervention, providers should consider implementing cesarean postoperative care with gum chewing.",

OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated the effectiveness of chewing gum on promoting faster bowel function and its ability to hasten recovery for patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) after posterior spinal fusion (PSF) surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Sham feeding with chewing gum had been reported to reduce the incidence of postoperative ileus by accelerating recovery of bowel function. METHODS: We prospectively recruited and randomized 60 patients with AIS scheduled for PSF surgery into treatment (chewing gum) and control group. The patient-controlled anesthesia usage, wound pain score, abdominal pain score, nausea score, and abdominal girth were assessed and recorded at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 hours postoperatively. The timing for the first fluid intake, first oral intake, sitting up, walking, first flatus after surgery, first bowel opening after surgery, and duration of hospital stay were also assessed and recorded. RESULTS: We found that there were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in patient-controlled anesthesia usage, wound pain score, abdominal pain score, nausea score, and abdominal girth between treatment (chewing gum) and control groups. We also found that there were no significant difference (P > 0.05) in postoperative recovery parameters, which were the first fluid intake, first oral intake, sitting up after surgery, walking after surgery, first flatus after surgery, first bowel opening after surgery, and duration of hospital stay between both groups. The wound pain was the worst at 12 hours postoperatively, which progressively improved in both groups. The abdominal pain progressively worsened to the highest score at 48 hours in the treatment group and 36 hours in the control group before improving after that. The pattern of severity and recovery of wound pain and abdominal pain was different. CONCLUSION: We found that chewing gum did not significantly reduce the abdominal pain, promote faster bowel function, or hasten patient recovery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Pain is a common side effect of orthodontic treatment. An objective of this study, part of a large previously reported RCT on pain and analgesic use, was to determine the effect of anxiety on perceived pain and use of analgesia. METHODS: 1000 patients aged 11-17 years, undergoing upper and lower fixed appliance treatment in nine hospital departments were recruited into this two-arm parallel design randomised controlled trial. One arm was given sugar-free chewing gum and the other arm ibuprofen for pain relief. Neither the clinicians nor patients were blinded to assignment. In addition to recording pain experience and analgesic use for 3 days following appliance placement and first archwire change, each patient recorded their level of anxiety immediately following the fitting of the appliance and the first archwire change. RESULTS: 419 chewing gum group (84%) and 407 ibuprofen group (83%) questionnaires were returned following appliance placement, and 343 chewing gum group (70%) and 341 ibuprofen group (71%) questionnaires were returned following the first archwire change. The mean anxiety scores following fitting of the appliance and first archwire change were 2.7 (SD 2.1) and 1.6 (SD 1.8), respectively. There were weak but significant positive associations between anxiety scores and pain scores. Multi-level modelling produced a coefficient for anxiety of 0.23 (95% CI 0.17-0.28) for appliance placement, suggesting a small rise (0.23) on the 11-point pain scale for a one-point increase on the corresponding anxiety scale. Following archwire change, the corresponding coefficient was 0.32 (0.24-0.39). For ibuprofen use, again simple analyses suggested a relationship with anxiety. Multi-level logistic modelling produced an odds ratio for ibuprofen use of 1.11 (95% CI 1.07-1.15) at appliance placement and 1.21 (1.10-1.33) at the first archwire change. There was a 10-20% increase in the odds of using ibuprofen for each one-point increase on the anxiety scale. No such relationship was found between anxiety and chewing gum use. There were no adverse effects or harms reported during the trial. Approvals were granted by the Research Ethics Committee (08/H0106/139), R&D and MHRA (Eudract 2008-005522-36) and the trial was registered on the ISRCTN (79884739) and NIHR (6631) portfolios. Support was provided by the British Orthodontic Society Foundation. CONCLUSIONS: There was a weak positive correlation between anxiety reported and pain experienced following both the initial fitting of the fixed appliances and at the subsequent archwire change. Patients that were more anxious tended to take more ibuprofen for their pain relief.",

Three databases were searched with the following focused question: 'Can chewing gum additionally reduce halitosis parameters, such as organoleptic scores and volatile sulfur compounds (VSC), when compared to a control treatment'? Controlled clinical trials presenting at least two halitosis measurements (organoleptic scores and/or VSC) were included. Ten studies were included, and different active ingredients were used. One study was performed using a chewing gum without any active ingredient. Chewing gum containing probiotic bacterium was shown to significantly reduce the organoleptic scores. Chewing gums containing zinc acetate and magnolia bark extract as well as allylisothiocyanate (AITC) with zinc lactate significantly reduced the levels of VSC in comparison to a placebo chewing gum. Furthermore, a sodium bicarbonate-containing chewing gum significantly reduced the VSC levels in comparison to rinsing with water. Furthermore, eucalyptus-extract chewing gum showed significant reductions in both organoleptic scores and VSC when compared with a control chewing gum. Chewing gum containing sucrose was able to reduce the VSC levels, in comparison to xylitol and zinc citrate chewing gum, but only for 5 min. It was concluded that chewing gums containing probiotics Lactobaccilus, zinc acetate and magnolia bark extract, eucalyptus-extract, and AITC with zinc lactate may be suitable for halitosis management. However, the low number of included studies and the high heterogeneity among the selected studies may limit the clinical applications of these findings.",

All patients in the trial received standard treatment consistent with the guidelines for AP. The primary outcomes were mortality, length of stay (LOS), and medical expenses. Secondary outcomes were the incidence of complications and other adverse events, return of gastrointestinal function, the details of enteral nutrition and intra-abdominal pressure. RESULTS From May 2014 to December 2015, a total of 204 patients were recruited. The LOS and hospital costs in the sham feeding group were reduced, although mortality was equivalent between groups. The return of gastrointestinal function occurred earlier in the sham feeding group, with no complications related to gum chewing.

Patients treated with SMD and acupuncture experienced significantly shorter hospital stay, shorter time to first flatus and shorter time to defecation than patients in the other groups (all P < 0.05).

In this pilot study, we tested the feasibility of a large randomized controlled trial. METHODS: We randomized 94 female patients undergoing laparoscopic or breast surgery to ondansetron 4 mg i.v. or chewing gum if PONV was experienced in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU). The primary outcome was full resolution of PONV, with non-inferiority defined as a difference between groups of <15% in a per protocol analysis. Secondary outcomes were PACU stay duration, anti-emetic rescue use, and acceptability of anti-emetic treatment. The feasibility of implementing the protocol in a larger trial was assessed. RESULTS: Postoperative nausea and vomiting in the PACU occurred in 13 (28%) ondansetron patients and 15 (31%) chewing gum patients (P=0.75). Three chewing gum patients could not chew gum when they developed PONV. On a per protocol basis, full resolution of PONV occurred in five of 13 (39%) ondansetron vs nine of 12 (75%) chewing gum patients [risk difference 37% (6.3-67%), P=0.07]. There was no difference in secondary outcomes between groups. Recruitment was satisfactory, the protocol was acceptable to anaesthetists and nurses, and data collection was complete. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot trial, chewing gum was not inferior to ondansetron for treatment of PONV after general anaesthesia for laparoscopic or breast surgery in female patients. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of a larger, multicentred randomized controlled trial to investigate this novel therapy.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Caesarean sections (CS) are the most frequent major surgery in the world. A transient impairment of bowel motility is expected after CS. Although this usually resolves spontaneously within a few days, it can cause considerable discomfort, require symptomatic medication and delay hospital discharge, thus increasing costs. Chewing gum in the immediate postoperative period is a simple intervention that may be effective in enhancing recovery of bowel function in other types of abdominal surgeries. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of chewing gum to reduce the duration of postoperative ileus and to enhance postoperative recovery after a CS. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (20 June 2016), LILACs (20 June 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov (20 June 2016), WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (20 June 2016) and the reference lists of retrieved studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials comparing chewing gum versus usual care, for women in the first 24 hours after a CS. We included studies published in abstract form only.Quasi-randomised, cross-over or cluster-randomised trials were not eligible for inclusion in this review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected the studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias following standard Cochrane methods. We present dichotomous outcome results as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous outcome results as mean differences (MD) and 95% CI. We pooled the results of similar studies using a random-effects model in case of important heterogeneity. We used the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We included 17 randomised trials (3149 participants) conducted in nine different countries. Seven studies (1325 women) recruited exclusively women undergoing elective CS and five studies (833 women) only included women having a primary CS. Ten studies (1731 women) used conventional feeding protocols (nil by mouth until the return of intestinal function). The gum-chewing regimen varied among studies, in relation to its initiation (immediately after CS, up to 12 hours later), duration of each session (from 15 to 60 minutes) and number of sessions per day (three to more than six). All the studies were classified as having a high risk of bias due to the nature of the intervention, women could not be blinded and most of the outcomes were self-reported.Primary outcomes of this review: for the women that chewed gum, the time to passage of first flatus was seven hours shorter than those women in the 'usual care' control group (MD -7.09 hours, 95% CI -9.27 to -4.91 hours; 2399 women; 13 studies; random-effects Tau² = 14.63, I² = 95%, very low-quality evidence). This effect was consistent in all subgroup analyses (primary and repeat CS, time spent chewing gum per day, early and conventional feeding protocols, elective and non-elective CS and time after CS when gum-chewing was initiated). The rate of ileus was on average over 60% lower in the chewing-gum group compared to the control (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.80; 1139 participants; four studies; I² = 39%, low-quality evidence). Tolerance to gum-chewing appeared to be high. Three women in one study complained about the chewing gum (but no further information was provided) and none of the studies reported adverse effects (eight studies, 925 women, low-quality evidence).Secondary outcomes of this review: the time to passage of faeces occurred on average nine hours earlier in the intervention group (MD -9.22 hours, 95% CI -11.49 to -6.95 hours; 2016 participants; 11 studies; random-effects Tau² = 12.53, I² = 93%, very low-quality evidence). The average duration of hospital stay was shorter in the intervention compared to the control group (MD -0.36 days, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.18 days; 1489 participants; seven studies; random-effects Tau² = 0.04, I² = 92%). The first intestinal sounds were heard earlier in the intervention than in the control group (MD -4.56 hours, 95% CI -6.18 to -2.93 hours; 1729 participants; nine studies; random-effects Tau² = 5.41, I² = 96%). None of the studies assessed women's satisfaction in relation to having to chew gum. The need for analgesia or antiemetic agents did not differ between the intervention and control groups (average RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.13; 726 participants; three studies; random-effects Tau² = 0.79, I² = 69%). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review found 17 randomised controlled trials (involving 3149 women). We downgraded the quality of the evidence for time to first passage of flatus and of faeces and for adverse effects/intolerance to gum chewing because of the high risk of bias of the studies (due to lack of blinding and self-report). For time to first flatus and faeces, we downgraded the quality of the evidence further because of the high heterogeneity in these meta-analyses and the potential for publication bias based on the visual inspection of the funnel plots. The quality of the evidence for adverse effects/tolerance to gum chewing and for ileus was downgraded because of the small number of events. The quality of the evidence for ileus was further downgraded due to the unclear risk of bias for the assessors evaluating this outcome.The available evidence suggests that gum chewing in the immediate postoperative period after a CS is a well tolerated intervention that enhances early recovery of bowel function. However the overall quality of the evidence is very low to low.Further research is necessary to establish the optimal regimen of gum-chewing (initiation, number and duration of sessions per day) to enhance bowel function recovery and to assess potential adverse effects of and women's satisfaction with this intervention. New studies also need to assess the compliance of the participants to the recommended gum-chewing instructions. Future large, well designed and conducted studies, with better methodological and reporting quality, will help to inform future updates of this review and enhance the body of evidence for this intervention.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chewing gum may enhance intestinal motility after surgery. This trial studied whether chewing gum could lead to a further reduction in ileus in patients who had a laparoscopic colorectal resection and followed an enhanced recovery programme. METHODS: Patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal resection were randomized to a control or intervention group. Patients in the control group received a standardized recovery programme. Patients in the intervention group were, in addition, given chewing gum three times daily from day 1 until discharge. Primary outcome measures were time to first flatus and first bowel motion. Time to feeling hungry and hospital stay were secondary outcome measures. RESULTS: Forty-one patients were randomized into each group. Thirty-seven patients underwent rectal resection and 45 had a colonic resection. Time to passage of flatus was shorter (18 versus 34 h; P = 0·007), first bowel motion occurred earlier (19 versus 44 h; P = 0·001) and time to feeling hungry was earlier (16 versus 25 h; P = 0·001) in the intervention group. There was no difference in the duration of hospital stay (5 days in the intervention group versus 5·5 days in the control group). Subgroup analyses revealed that the benefits of chewing gum were clearer in patients who had a colonic resection, with a shorter time to first flatus (20 versus 35 h; P = 0·043), first bowel motion (19 versus 53 h; P = 0·014) and feeling hungry (14 versus 40 h; P = 0·001). No adverse events were attributed to chewing gum. CONCLUSION: Chewing gum is a simple intervention that speeds intestinal transit in patients managed with a recovery programme after laparoscopic colorectal resection.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The aim of this randomized trial was to investigate the effect of the use of a sugar-free chewing gum vs ibuprofen on reported pain in orthodontic patients. METHODS: This was a 2-arm parallel design randomized controlled trial in 9 sites in the southwest of England. Patients about to undergo orthodontic treatment with maxillary and mandibular fixed appliances were recruited and randomly allocated to an experimental chewing gum group or a control ibuprofen group. Eligibility criteria included patients undergoing fixed maxillary and mandibular appliance therapy, aged 11 to 17 years, and able to use ibuprofen and chewing gum. The primary outcome measure was pain experienced after appliance placement using a mean of 3 recordings on a scale of 0 to 10. Secondary outcome measures were pain experienced in the subsequent 3 days, pain after the first archwire change, ibuprofen use, and appliance breakages. Pain scores were recorded with a questionnaire and posted to a collection center by each patient. Randomization was by means of a central telephone service and comprised computer-generated random numbers used to generate a sequential allocation list, with permuted blocks of variable size (2 and 4) and stratified by center. Neither the clinicians nor the patients were blinded to the intervention. Patients in the control group were permitted to use ibuprofen only, and patients in the experimental group were allowed to use ibuprofen if they did not get sufficient analgesia from the chewing gum. Data were analyzed using the principle of intention to treat with multilevel modeling to reflect the structured nature of the data (scores within patient within site). RESULTS: One thousand patients were recruited and randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to the chewing gum and ibuprofen (control) groups. The male-to-female ratios were similar in the groups. The pain questionnaire response rates were good at approximately 84% and 83% after appliance placement (chewing gum group, 419; ibuprofen group, 407) and 70% and 71% after the first archwire change (chewing gum group, 343; ibuprofen group, 341). The primary outcomes were similar for the 2 groups: mean pain scores, 4.31 in the chewing gum group and 4.17 in the ibuprofen group; difference, 0.14 (95% CI, -0.13 to 0.41). There was a suggestion that the relative pain scores for the 2 groups changed over time, with the chewing gum group experiencing slightly more pain on the day of bond-up and less on the subsequent 3 days; however, the differences had no clinical importance. There were no significant differences for the period after archwire change. The reported use of ibuprofen was less in the chewing gum group than in the ibuprofen group; after appliance placement, the mean numbers of occasions that ibuprofen was used were 2.1 in the chewing gum group and 3.0 in the ibuprofen group (adjusted difference, -0.96 [95% CI, -0.75 to -1.17; P <0.001]); after archwire change, the figures were 0.8 and 1.5 occasions (difference, -0.65 [-0.44 to -0.86; P <0.001]). After appliance placement and the first archwire change, there was no clinically or statistically significant difference in appliance breakages between the chewing gum and ibuprofen groups after either bond-up (7% and 8.8%, respectively) or the first archwire change (4.2% and 5.5%, respectively). No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a sugar-free chewing gum may reduce the level of ibuprofen usage but has no clinically or statistically significant effect on bond failures.

We aim to assess the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of chewing gum to reduce ileus, and decrease time to oral tolerance. METHODS: A randomized trial was conducted in 5-18 year old patients that underwent an appendectomy. Subjects in the intervention group received sugar-free chewing gum within the first 12 h after surgery and control group received the usual therapy. We assessed the acceptability of the intervention, time to pass first flatus, present first bowel movement, and time to tolerate oral intake. RESULTS: A total of 41 patients were recruited, 21 in the intervention group and 20 in the control group. Mean time (SD) to first flatus in the intervention group was 17.18 h (8.18), and 24.37 h (17.53) in the control group (mean difference [MD] of -7.19 h; 95% CI, -15.7 to 1.38). Time to first bowel movement (MD, -4.6 h, 95%CI -18.5 to 9.3), time to tolerate oral intake (MD, 4.17 h; 95%CI -9.2 to 17.5), and length of hospital stay (MD, 6.9 h, 95%CI -19.1 to 33.1) appeared not to be affected by the intervention. Chewing gum was accepted, well tolerated, and without complications. DISCUSSION: The use of chewing gum in children undergoing an appendectomy was safe and well tolerated and might lead to a faster recovery of bowel function, more studies are needed to prove if length of hospital stay and other outcomes are improved.",

Oral mucositis is usually associated with transient decrease in saliva production. The goal was to study effects of gum consumption on oral mucositis in children undergoing chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHOD: This randomized controlled trial was done in Amir Kabir Hospital, Arak, Iran. 130 children 5 to 15 years of age were studied. Control group was composed of 65 children who received mucotoxic drugs. Test group was made up of 65 patients received similar drugs in addition to sugar free gums. Patients consumed 6 pieces of gums per day for 15 days. A standardized follow up form and World Health Organization (WHO) grading system for oral mucositis were used for evaluation of patients during 15 days of treatment. RESULTS: Severe oral mucositis occurred in 30 (46%) of 65 patients in the test group and in 26 of 65 (40%) patients in the control group. Difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Rate of mild to moderate mucoitis (grade 1 and 2) was significantly lower in patients who used gums (15 % vs. 35%, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study showed that stimulation of saliva flow by chewing gum could decrease mild to moderate inflammatory injuries of the oral mucosa during chemotherapy. However, it was not effective to subside severe mucositis."

In addition, the measurement of masticatory efficiency contributes to the evaluation of therapeutic successes within the stomatognathic system. However, the question remains unanswered as to what extent modern techniques are able to reproduce the subtle differences in masticatory efficiency within various patient groups. The purpose of this review is to provide an extensive summary of the evaluation of masticatory performance by means of a color-changeable chewing gum with regard to its clinical relevance and applicability. STUDY SELECTION: A general overview describing the various methods available for this task has already been published. This review focuses in depth on the research findings available on the technique of measuring masticatory performance by means of color-changeable chewing gum. Described are the mechanism and the differentiability of the color change and methods to evaluate the color changes. Subsequently, research on masticatory performance is conducted with regard to patient age groups, the impact of general diseases and the effect of prosthetic and surgical treatment. RESULTS: The studies indicate that color-changeable chewing gum is a valid and reliable method for the evaluation of masticatory function. CONCLUSION: Apart from other methods, in clinical practice this technique can enhance dental diagnostics as well as the assessment of therapy outcomes.",

This may induce swallowing difficulties, compromised oral well-being, reduced nutrition intake, or speech deficiencies. Consequently, quality of life is often impaired for these patients. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility to mechanically stimulate residual saliva function by using tasteless and sugar-free chewing gum. It was hypothesized that tasteless and sugar-free chewing gum could immediately increase salivary flow and potentially improve oral well-being when used on a regular basis. METHODS: From October to December 2014, 31 consecutive patients treated with primary radiotherapy (RT) and concomitant cisplatin (in locally advanced cases) for oral or oropharyngeal cancer consented to participate. All patients had finalized RT 2-8 months prior to participation and suffered from xerostomia. Samples of unstimulated and chewing gum-stimulated saliva were obtained at the entry into the study (Visit 1). For 2 weeks, patients used chewing gum on a regular basis whereupon saliva measurements were repeated to verify the changes (Visit 2). An abbreviated EORTC H&N35 questionnaire was completed for both visits. A small control group consisting of young and healthy individuals also tested the chewing gum. RESULTS: Twenty patients completed the study and an increase in saliva flow was observed for 14 patients. Before and after intervention with chewing gum, an increase in mean saliva output was seen between unstimulated and stimulated saliva for both Visit 1 and 2 (p = 0.008 and p = 0.05, respectively). No change in saliva output was seen in the control group. CONCLUSION: The chewing gum was able to stimulate saliva output that was seen at the beginning and at the end of the intervention. No improvement in baseline saliva was seen. Relevant changes in subjective measures of xerostomia were seen after 2 weeks of chewing the gum."

Studies suggest that chewing gum may reduce postoperative ileus; SMD and acupuncture at the tsusanli acupoint have long been used in China to promote bowel movement.Patients with primary HCC undergoing hepatectomy between January 2015 and August 2015 were randomized to receive SMD and acupuncture (n = 55) or chewing gum (n = 53) or no intervention (n = 54) starting on postoperative day 1 and continuing for 6 consecutive days or until flatus. Primary endpoints were occurrence of postoperative ileus and length of hospital stay; secondary endpoints were surgical complications.Groups treated with SMD and acupuncture or with chewing gum experienced significantly shorter time to first peristalsis, flatus, and defecation than the no-intervention group (all P < 0.05). Hospital stay was significantly shorter in the combined SMD and acupuncture group (mean 14.0 d, SD 4.9) than in the no-intervention group (mean 16.5 d, SD 6.8; P = 0.014), while length of stay was similar between the chewing gum group (mean 14.7, SD 6.2) and the no-intervention group (P = 0.147). Incidence of grades I and II complications was slightly lower in both intervention groups than in the no-intervention group.The combination of SMD and acupuncture may reduce incidence of postoperative ileus and shorten hospital stay in HCC patients after hepatectomy. Chewing gum may also reduce incidence of ileus but does not appear to affect hospital stay. (Clinicaltrials.gov registration number: NCT02438436.).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The goal of this prospective study was to estimate the absorbed (radiation) doses to salivary glands in radioiodine therapy of thyroid cancer under chewing-gum stimulation using (124)I positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging. METHODS: Duplex ultrasonography was conducted in three test persons for visual comparison of the glandular blood flow with three different stimulation types (no stimulation, chewing tasteless gum base, sucking on lemon slices). Ten patients with newly diagnosed differentiated thyroid cancer received (124)I PET/CT dosimetry after thyroidectomy and prior to radioiodine therapy. Patients underwent a series of three (124)I PET/CT scans (4, 24, and ≥96 h after administration of 23 MBq (124)I). They were instructed to chew gum base (tasteless) approximately 20 min after ingesting the (124)I-containing capsule in the course of the first day. Absorbed doses per administered (131)I activity to the salivary glands were calculated and compared with the previously published results of the lemon-juice stimulation and non-stimulation groups. RESULTS: The sonograms in the three test persons showed that glandular blood perfusion by lemon-juice stimulation was clearly increased compared with non-stimulation or chewing of gum base. The sonogram comparison between the chewing-gum stimulation and non-stimulation demonstrated a minor increase of blood flow for the gum base-stimulated salivary glands. The mean ± standard deviation of the absorbed dose per activity under chewing-gum stimulation for the submandibular and parotid glands (within parentheses) was 0.22 ± 0.09 Gy/GBq (0.22 ± 0.08 Gy/GBq). Compared with the absorbed doses of the non-stimulation group, 0.24 ± 0.08 Gy/GBq (0.21 ± 0.05 Gy/GBq), those of the chewing-gum stimulation group showed no significant change (P > 0.60), but the absorbed doses of the lemon-juice stimulation group, 0.35 ± 0.14 Gy/GBq (0.33 ± 0.09 Gy/GBq), were significantly higher (P < 0.04) than those of the chewing-gum stimulation group. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that salivary flow induced by chewing gum base does not cause a significant reduction of the salivary gland absorbed dose compared with that in the non-stimulation group. The increased blood flow appears to be a decisive factor causing the increased (131)I absorbed doses in the lemon-juice stimulation group."

Study 3 assessed the effects of chewing gum during one working day on well-being and performance, as well as postwork mood and cognitive performance. In Study 4, performance and well-being were reported throughout the workday and at the end of the day, and heart rate and cortisol were measured. Under experimental conditions, gum was associated with higher alertness regardless of whether performance tasks were completed and altered sustained attention. Rate of chewing and subjective force of chewing did not alter mood but had some limited effects on attention. Chewing gum during the workday was associated with higher productivity and fewer cognitive problems, raised cortisol levels in the morning, and did not affect heart rate. The results emphasise that chewing gum can attenuate reductions in alertness, suggesting that chewing gum enhances worker performance.",

Subjects within the experimental groups were taken the gums 3 times daily, after each meal for a period of 3 weeks. Pre- and post-intervention unstimulated saliva samples were quantified for S. mutans counts. RESULTS: A statistically significant reduction of salivary S. mutans was displayed in both groups A and B after the intervention when compared with baseline (P < 0.001), and group A shows more statistically significant reduction of salivary S. mutans than group B (P = 0.011). CONCLUSION: Daily consumption of chewing gum containing CPP-ACP and xylitol significantly reduces the level of salivary S. mutans, but chewing gum containing CPP-ACP can reduce the level of salivary S. mutans in more than xylitol chewing gum."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: In surgical correction of scoliosis in pediatric patients, gastrointestinal complications including postoperative ileus can result in extended hospital stays, poorer pain management, slower progression with physical therapy, and overall decreased patient satisfaction. In patients undergoing gastrointestinal, gynecological, and urological surgery, gum chewing has been shown to reduce time to flatus and passage of feces. The authors hypothesized that chewing gum could also speed return to normal bowel function in pediatric patients undergoing surgical correction of scoliosis. METHODS: The researchers obtained institutional review board approval for a prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Eligible patients included all adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients undergoing posterior spinal fusion. Exclusion criteria included previous gastrointestinal surgery or preexisting gastrointestinal disease. Patients were randomized by coin flip. The treatment group chewed sugar-free bubble gum 5 times a day for 20 to 30 minutes beginning on postoperative day 1; the control group did not chew gum. Patients were asked a series of questions regarding subjective gastrointestinal symptoms each day. Time to flatus and first passage of feces were recorded as indicators of return to normal bowel function. Normality of data was assessed using normal probability plots. RESULTS: A total of 83 patients completed the study (69 females and 14 males; mean age, 14.4 years). Of the 42 patients in the chewing gum group, 8 elected to stop chewing gum regularly before discharge for to a variety of reasons. Patients who chewed gum experienced first bowel movement on average 145.9 hours after surgery, 30.9 hours before those who did not chew gum (p = .04). Gum-chewing patients first experienced flatus an average of 55.2 hours after surgery, compared with 62.3 hours for controls. This trend did not reach statistical significance (p = .12). No difference was noted in duration of hospital stay, medications administered as required, or subjective symptoms. CONCLUSION: Chewing gum after posterior spinal fusion for scoliosis is safe and may speed return of normal bowel function. Chewing gum after surgical correction of scoliosis facilitates an earlier return to normal bowel function, which may improve patient satisfaction in the early postoperative period."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ileus commonly occurs after abdominal surgery, and is associated with complications and increased length of hospital stay (LOHS). Onset of ileus is considered to be multifactorial, and a variety of preventative methods have been investigated. Chewing gum (CG) is hypothesised to reduce postoperative ileus by stimulating early recovery of gastrointestinal (GI) function, through cephalo-vagal stimulation. There is no comprehensive review of this intervention in abdominal surgery. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether chewing gum after surgery hastens the return of gastrointestinal function. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (via Ovid), MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE (via Ovid), CINAHL (via EBSCO) and ISI Web of Science (June 2014). We hand-searched reference lists of identified studies and previous reviews and systematic reviews, and contacted CG companies to ask for information on any studies using their products. We identified proposed and ongoing studies from clinicaltrials.gov, World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and metaRegister of Controlled Trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included completed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that used postoperative CG as an intervention compared to a control group. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently collected data and assessed study quality using an adapted Cochrane risk of bias (ROB) tool, and resolved disagreements by discussion. We assessed overall quality of evidence for each outcome using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Studies were split into subgroups: colorectal surgery (CRS), caesarean section (CS) and other surgery (OS). We assessed the effect of CG on time to first flatus (TFF), time to bowel movement (TBM), LOHS and time to bowel sounds (TBS) through meta-analyses using a random-effects model. We investigated the influence of study quality, reviewers' methodological estimations and use of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programmes using sensitivity analyses. We used meta-regression to explore if surgical site or ROB scores predicted the extent of the effect estimate of the intervention on continuous outcomes. We reported frequency of complications, and descriptions of tolerability of gum and cost. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 81 studies that recruited 9072 participants for inclusion in our review. We categorised many studies at high or unclear risk of the bias' assessed. There was statistical evidence that use of CG reduced TFF [overall reduction of 10.4 hours (95% CI: -11.9, -8.9): 12.5 hours (95% CI: -17.2, -7.8) in CRS, 7.9 hours (95% CI: -10.0, -5.8) in CS, 10.6 hours (95% CI: -12.7, -8.5) in OS]. There was also statistical evidence that use of CG reduced TBM [overall reduction of 12.7 hours (95% CI: -14.5, -10.9): 18.1 hours (95% CI: -25.3, -10.9) in CRS, 9.1 hours (95% CI: -11.4, -6.7) in CS, 12.3 hours (95% CI: -14.9, -9.7) in OS]. There was statistical evidence that use of CG slightly reduced LOHS [overall reduction of 0.7 days (95% CI: -0.8, -0.5): 1.0 days in CRS (95% CI: -1.6, -0.4), 0.2 days (95% CI: -0.3, -0.1) in CS, 0.8 days (95% CI: -1.1, -0.5) in OS]. There was statistical evidence that use of CG slightly reduced TBS [overall reduction of 5.0 hours (95% CI: -6.4, -3.7): 3.21 hours (95% CI: -7.0, 0.6) in CRS, 4.4 hours (95% CI: -5.9, -2.8) in CS, 6.3 hours (95% CI: -8.7, -3.8) in OS]. Effect sizes were largest in CRS and smallest in CS. There was statistical evidence of heterogeneity in all analyses other than TBS in CRS.There was little difference in mortality, infection risk and readmission rate between the groups. Some studies reported reduced nausea and vomiting and other complications in the intervention group. CG was generally well-tolerated by participants. There was little difference in cost between the groups in the two studies reporting this outcome.Sensitivity analyses by quality of studies and robustness of review estimates revealed no clinically important differences in effect estimates. Sensitivity analysis of ERAS studies showed a smaller effect size on TFF, larger effect size on TBM, and no difference between groups for LOHS.Meta-regression analyses indicated that surgical site is associated with the extent of the effect size on LOHS (all surgical subgroups), and TFF and TBM (CS and CRS subgroups only). There was no evidence that ROB score predicted the extent of the effect size on any outcome. Neither variable explained the identified heterogeneity between studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review identified some evidence for the benefit of postoperative CG in improving recovery of GI function. However, the research to date has primarily focussed on CS and CRS, and largely consisted of small, poor quality trials. Many components of the ERAS programme also target ileus, therefore the benefit of CG alongside ERAS may be reduced, as we observed in this review. Therefore larger, better quality RCTS in an ERAS setting in wider surgical disciplines would be needed to improve the evidence base for use of CG after surgery.",

One non-pharmacological intervention that has shown promising results in reducing the duration of postoperative ileus is chewing gum after surgery. However, this has not been investigated in upper gastrointestinal surgery such as pancreatic surgery. Hence the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of chewing gum treatment on patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy ad modum whipple due to pancreatic or periampullary cancer. METHODS: This study was conducted as a phase III trial that was terminated early. Patients diagnosed with pancreatic tumours scheduled for pancreaticoduodenectomy ad modum whipple were included. The treatment group received chewing gum postoperatively and standard care. Controls received glucose solution and standard care. Chewing gum and glucose were used four times a day during the whole hospital stay. Time to first flatus and stool was defined as the primary outcome. The secondary outcome was start with clear liquids, start with liquid diet and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences could be observed between the chewing gum intervention group and the control group. However, a numerical difference in mean time was observed in first flatus, first stool, start of clear fluids, and start of liquid diet and length of hospital stay in favour of the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: Although this study did not find statistically significant differences favouring the use of chewing gum for postoperative ileus, a positive trend was observed of a reduction of the impact of postoperative ileus among patients after pancreatic surgery. It also contributes valuable methodological experience that is important for future studies of chewing gum interventions during recovery after pancreatic surgery.

METHODS: Data sources included Cochrane, PubMed, and EMBASE databases from inception to June 2012 and reference lists of known relevant articles without language restriction. Randomized controlled trials in which a treatment group that chewed gum was compared to a control group that fasted were included. Relevant data, including main outcomes of gastric fluid volume and gastric pH, were extracted. RESULTS: Four studies involving 287 patients were included. The presence of chewing gum was associated with small but statically significant increases in gastric fluid volume (mean difference = 0.21 mL/kg; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.39; P = .03) but not in gastric pH (mean difference = 0.11 mL/kg; 95% confidence interval, -0.14 to 0.36; P = .38). Gastric fluid volume and gastric pH remained unchanged in subgroup analysis by either sugar or sugarless gum type. CONCLUSIONS: Chewing gum in the perioperative period causes small but statically significant increases in gastric fluid volume and no change in gastric pH. The increase in gastric fluid most likely is of no clinical significance in terms of aspiration risk for the patient. Elective surgery should not necessarily be canceled or delayed in healthy patients who accidentally chew gum preoperatively.",
