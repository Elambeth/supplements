      "abstract": "Research from the past to the present has shown that natural ingredients in the human daily diet play a crucial role in preventing various diseases. One well-known compound is β-glucan, a natural polysaccharide found in the cell walls of many fungi, yeasts, and some microorganisms, as well as in plants such as barley and wheat. β-glucans are widely recognized for their ability to lower cholesterol and blood glucose levels, thereby reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. In addition to their effects on lipid levels and glucose metabolism, these molecules exhibit antioxidant properties by eliminating reactive oxygen species. As a result, they help lower the risk of conditions such as atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders, diabetes, and cancer. Furthermore, β-glucans have been reported to possess immune-boosting and antitumor effects. By binding to specific receptors on the surface of immune cells, they stimulate immune activity. Additionally, β-glucans belong to a group of probiotics that promote the growth and activity of beneficial gut microbiota, preventing the proliferation of harmful pathogens. They play a vital role in maintaining gastrointestinal health, reducing inflammation, and lowering the risk of colon cancer. Further research on the health benefits of β-glucans may be key to improving overall well-being and preventing many chronic non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and cancer."

      "abstract": "The global increase in cancer cases, particularly prostate cancer, poses a significant health challenge worldwide. Conventional treatments such as surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy offer valuable options but are associated with limitations and potential side effects. As a result, there is growing interest in complementary therapies, including natural compounds such as β-glucans, derived from sources such as yeast and mushrooms. In this review, we explored the potential therapeutic role of medicinal mushrooms β-glucan in prostate cancer treatment. β-glucans has demonstrated anti-cancer properties in preclinical studies, including inhibition of proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and modulation of immune responses. Studies in prostate cancer cell lines and animal models have shown promising results, with β-glucan inhibiting tumor growth, inducing DNA damage, and regulating tumor markers such as p53 and prostate specific antigen. β-glucans acts through various pathways, including stimulation of dendritic cells, modulation of cytokine secretion, suppression of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and enhancement of immune responses. Moreover, β-glucans exhibits anti-androgenic and immune-modulatory effects, making it a promising candidate for prostate cancer treatment. In this study, we also focused on the mechanism of action of β-glucans through various pathways including tumor cell death by oxidative stress created through ROS generation and autophagy. Although preclinical studies support the potential therapeutic efficacy of medicinal mushrooms β-glucans, further research is needed to elucidate its clinical utility and safety in human trials.",

      "abstract": "Oat beta-glucans (OBGs) are known for their beneficial effects on gut health, including anti-inflammatory and prebiotic effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of two doses (1% or 3% w/w) of dietary low-molar-mass OBG supplementation on colorectal cancer (CRC) development, immune cell profiles, intestinal barrier protein expression, and microbiota composition in a rat model of CRC induced by azoxymethane (AOM). Microbiome analysis revealed significant differences between the control and CRC groups. OBG supplementation influenced microbial diversity and abundance, particularly increasing the population of beneficial bacteria, such as Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae, associated with butyrate production. However, higher doses of OBG (3%) led to a decrease in butyrate-producing bacteria and a shift toward higher levels of Akkermansia muciniphila and Enterococcus faecalis. Immune cell profiling showed a higher percentage of T lymphocytes (CD3+) in rats fed a diet supplemented with 3% OBG, both in the intraepithelial (IEL) and lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs). Immunohistochemical analysis of the large intestine revealed a significantly elevated expression of intestinal barrier proteins, i.e., claudin 3 and 4 in rats receiving 1% OBG, while claudin 7 expression was reduced in early-stage CRC. Gene expression analysis also revealed a significant downregulation of Cldn1 in CRC rats. These findings suggest that dietary OBG supplementation modulates the gut microbiota, immune response, and intestinal barrier integrity, with potential implications for nutritional CRC development prevention and treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "This study evaluated short-term immune responses of dairy ewes supplemented with barley β-glucan (BG) following an intramammary Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. In the adaptation period, 36 ewes were fed an alfalfa hay diet ad libitum and barley grain cv. Hispanic (3.8% BG). Then, ewes were assigned into three experimental groups: (1) Control (CON), the same previous diet (13.3 g BG/d); (2) high β-glucans barley (HBG), new barley (cv. Annapurna) containing 10% BG (35 g BG/d); (3) intraperitoneally injected (INP) with a 1.4% BG solution dose (2 g BG/ewe). At d 9, all ewes were infused with an E. coli LPS or saline solution in each udder half. After the challenge, rectal temperature (RT), milk yield and composition, somatic cell count (SCC), and plasma interleukins (IL-1α and IL-1β) were monitored daily. The INP treatment revealed a transitory increase in RT and decreased milk yield by 38%. Milk fat, protein, and SCC increased in LPS-treated udders but not by BG treatment. The IL-1α plasma concentration was similar among groups but INP ewes showed a lower IL-1β concentration suggesting a lower inflammatory response. The BG administration appears more effective intraperitoneally than orally, which needs additional study."

      "abstract": "In allergen-specific immunotherapy, adjuvants are explored for modulating allergen-specific Th2 immune responses to re-establish clinical tolerance. One promising class of adjuvants are β-glucans, which are naturally derived sugar structures and components of dietary fibers that activate C-type lectin (CLR)-, \"Toll\"-like receptors (TLRs), and complement receptors (CRs). We characterized the immune-modulating properties of six commercially available β-glucans, using immunological (receptor activation, cytokine secretion, and T cell modulating potential) as well as metabolic parameters (metabolic state) in mouse bone marrow-derived myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs). All tested β-glucans activated the CLR Dectin-1a, whereas TLR2 was predominantly activated by Zymosan. Further, the tested β-glucans differentially induced mDC-derived cytokine secretion and activation of mDC metabolism. Subsequent analyses focusing on Zymosan, Zymosan depleted, β-1,3 glucan, and β-1,3 1,6 glucan revealed robust mDC activation with the upregulation of the cluster of differentiation 40 (CD40), CD80, CD86, and MHCII to different extents. β-glucan-induced cytokine secretion was shown to be, in part, dependent on the activation of the intracellular Dectin-1 adapter molecule Syk. In co-cultures of mDCs with Th2-biased CD4+ T cells isolated from birch allergen Bet v 1 plus aluminum hydroxide (Alum)-sensitized mice, these four β-glucans suppressed allergen-induced IL-5 secretion, while only Zymosan and β-1,3 glucan significantly suppressed allergen-induced interferon gamma (IFNγ) secretion, suggesting the tested β-glucans to have distinct effects on mDC T cell priming capacity. Our experiments indicate that β-glucans have distinct immune-modulating properties, making them interesting adjuvants for future allergy treatment.",

      "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in dogs is the most common chronic gastrointestinal disease in dogs. Its etiology evolves an aberrant immunological response towards food antigens and indigenous bacteria in the gut bacteria and, consequently, dysbiosis. Prebiotics provide substrates for the growth of beneficial bacteria and promote the production of beneficial fermentation products. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of oral supplementations of beta-glucans and mannanoligosaccharides (MOSs) over 60 days in fecal microbiota and fecal concentrations of fermentation products in dogs with mild IBD. Eighteen dogs with mild IBD were divided into three experimental groups in a blinded and randomized manner: A-dogs received 0.1% of a beta-glucan-based prebiotic, B-dogs received 0.1% of a MOS + beta-glucan-based prebiotic, and C-dogs received 0.1% of a placebo. Fecal microbiota was analyzed using the latest generation 16S rRNA sequencing (Illumina®). Relative abundances of each taxon were analyzed using a generalized linear model, and fermentation products using a mixed model. A significance level of p was used. The prebiotics positively modulated the bacterial population of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Treatment A improved alpha diversity and populations of beneficial bacteria. Beta-glucan supplementation for 60 days had beneficial effects on modulating intestinal microbiota in dogs with mild IBD."

      "abstract": "Modernization and lifestyle changes have resulted in a number of diseases, including cancer, that require complicated and thorough treatments. One of the most important therapies is the administration of antibiotics and medicines. This is known as chemotherapy for cancer, and it is a regularly utilised treatment plan in which the medications used have negative side effects. This has resulted in extensive research on materials capable of delivering pharmaceuticals to particular targets over an extended period of time. Biopolymers have often been preferred as effective drug delivery carriers. Of these, β-glucan, a natural polysaccharide, has not been extensively studied as a drug delivery carrier, despite its unique properties. This review discusses the sources, extraction techniques, structures, and characteristics of β-glucan to provide an overview. Furthermore, the different methods employed to encapsulate drugs into β-glucan and its role as an efficient drug, SiRNA and Plasmid DNA carrier have been elaborated in this article. The capacity of β-glucan-based to specifically target and alter tumour-associated macrophages, inducing an immune response ultimately resulting in tumour suppression has been elaborated. Finally, this study aims to stimulate further research on β-glucan by thoroughly describing its many characteristics and demonstrating its effectiveness as a drug delivery vehicle.",

The extraction and concentration of β-glucan from sand were performed at a pilot scale using autolysis with 3 % sodium chloride, temperature elevation, treatment with organic solvents and water, hydrolysis via proteases, and vacuum filtration. The chemical composition and functional properties of concentrated β-glucan were evaluated to determine its quality and efficacy. In addition, the values of TPH removal efficiency obtained using concentrated β-glucan, water, and the commercial emulsifier Tween-80 were compared. The mass recovery of concentrated β-glucan was 5.59 %, with a β-glucan content of 38.60 %. The efficiency of ex-situ removal of TPH from hydrocarbon-impacted sands containing 78323 mg/kg of TPH reached 50 % and 70 % when the concentrated β-glucan concentrations used were 70.3 % and 80.3 %, respectively. These efficiency values are higher than those obtained when water was used for TPH removal but lower than those obtained when Tween-80 was used for TPH removal."

Raised serum cholesterol and blood pressure are important modifiable risk factors in the development of CVD and emerging evidence highlights the role of the gut microbiota in ameliorating such biomarkers and clinical characteristics of the disease. The proposed mechanism of action of β-glucans on the pathophysiological mechanisms of disease have yet to be elucidated. Validating gaps in the literature may substantiate β-glucans as a potential novel dietary therapy against modifiable risk factors for CVD and would further support the public health significance of including a habitual fiber-rich diet.",

The training required the Dectin-1/CR3, TLR4, and MMR receptors, as well as the Raf-1, Syk, and PI3K downstream signaling molecules. By activating multiple receptors and downstream signaling pathways, the components of this β-glucan preparation are able to act synergistically, causing a robust secondary response upon an unrelated challenge. In in-vivo murine models of melanoma and bladder cell carcinoma, pre-treatment of mice with the β-glucan preparation led to a significant reduction in tumor growth.

METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, parallel, controlled, and multicenter clinical trial was conducted in patients with cancer and malnutrition. The trial compared prescribed dietary advice and two packs per day, for 8 weeks, of a hypercaloric (400 kcal/pack) and hyperproteic ONS (20 g/pack) with fiber and specific ingredients (leucine, EPA and DHA, and beta-glucans) (enhanced-ONS) versus an isocaloric and isoproteic formula (standard-ONS) without specific ingredients. Food intake was assessed with a 3-day dietary survey, and adherence to the supplement with a patient self-completed diary. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients completed the intervention period. The combined intervention of dietary advice and ONS managed to increase the energy intake of the overall cohort by 792.55 (378.57) kcal/day, protein by 40.72 (19.56) g/day. Increases in energy and nutrient intakes were observed in both groups, both in dietary intake and associated exclusively with the supplement. The group that received the enhanced-ONS ingested a greater volume of product when there was a greater severity of malnutrition; a tumor location in the head, neck, upper digestive area, liver, or pancreas; more advanced stages of the tumor; or the receipt of more than one antineoplastic treatment. CONCLUSION: The use of an enhanced-ONS helps meet the nutritional requirements of cancer patients, especially those who have a more compromised clinical condition, with high adherence, good tolerance, and acceptance.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This exploratory case-control study is to evaluate the effects of supplementation of Aureobasidium pullulans-N-163 strain produced 1,3-1,- 6 beta glucan in young patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). METHODS: Twenty-seven male subjects aged 5-19 years with DMD were included, nine in the control arm and 18 in the treatment arm to receive N-163 beta glucan along with conventional therapies for 45 days. While performing the analysis, steroid usage was also taken into consideration, those not administered steroids (Steroid -ve) (Control, n = 5; treatment, n = 9), those administered steroids (Steroid +ve) (Control, n = 4; treatment, n = 9). RESULTS: IL-6 showed a significant decrease in the treatment groups, especially the N-163 Steroid -ve group. IL-13 decreased in both treatment groups and TGF-β levels showed a significant decrease in the treatment groups, especially the N-163 Steroid -ve group, (p < 0.05). Dystrophin levels increased by up to 32% in the treatment groups compared to the control. Medical research council (MRC) grading showed slight improvement in muscle strength improvement in 12 out of 18 patients (67%) in the treatment group and four out of nine (44%) subjects in the control group. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with the N-163 beta glucan food supplement produced beneficial effects: a significant decrease in inflammation and fibrosis markers, increase in serum dystrophin and slight improvement in muscle strength in DMD subjects over 45 days, thus making this a potential adjunct treatment for DMD after validation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered in Clinical trials registry of India, CTRI/2021/05/033346. Registered on 5th May, 2021."

Objectives: This scoping review aims to present the current knowledge on the anti-infective properties of β-glucans in the pediatric population. Methods: We used the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews Checklist to prepare this review. Studies were identified by electronic searches of Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane databases up to May 2021. Results: The primary search allowed us to find 6232 studies, twelve of which were finally included in the analysis. Eight studies were designed as randomized, placebo-controlled trials, while in four studies the intervention outcome was compared with the pre-intervention period in the same group. The type of preparation and doses varied between studies: in five trials pleuran was administered (in dose 10 mg/5 kg of body weight/day), and in one study baker's yeast β-glucan was used (in two doses: 35 mg/day and 75 mg/day). In six other studies, the analyzed preparation comprised β-glucan and other substances. The shortest study lasted seven days, while the most prolonged intervention lasted six months, followed by six months of follow-up. Ten out of twelve trials demonstrated the effectiveness of β-glucans in reducing respiratory tract infection incidence or alleviation of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms. Ten out of twelve studies have reported a good tolerance and safety profile. Conclusions: Good tolerance of β-glucans shows a favorable benefit-risk ratio of this type of intervention. Nevertheless, further monitoring of their efficacy and safety in high-quality research is necessary.",

      "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common chronic liver disease nowadays. Currently, there is no officially approved drug to treat NAFLD. In view of the increasing global prevalence of NAFLD and an absence of treatments, the development of effective treatments is of utmost importance. β-glucan, a natural bioactive polysaccharide, has demonstrated hepatoprotective effects in NAFLD prevention and treatment. This review solely focuses on gathering the published preclinical animal studies that demonstrated the anti-liver injury, anti-steatotic, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and antioxidant activities of β-glucan. The impact of β-glucan on gut microbiota and its metabolites including short-chain fatty acids and bile acids as the underlying mechanism for its bioactive beneficial effect on NAFLD is also explored. Given the limited knowledge of β-glucan on anti-fibrotic activity, bile acid metabolism, and gut microbiota function, additional relevant research is highly encouraged to lay a solid foundation for the use of food-derived β-glucan as a functional food for NAFLD. It is envisaged that further investigation of food-derived β-glucan in human clinical studies should be carried out for its wider utilization."

      "abstract": "β-Glucans are a group of heterogeneous glucose polymers that possess immunomodulatory activities. The complex nature of their structures, uncertainty regarding the doses, and variable immune effects pose a challenge to comprehensive understanding. In this study, we investigated the immune responses and apoptosis effects in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) head kidney macrophages (MФ) upon exposure to two β-Glucans (Paramylon and Laminarin) at low and high doses. Our results demonstrate that Paramylon elicits more robust immune responses than Laminarin, albeit with a dose-limiting effect. We also observed that the high-dose Paramylon induces apoptosis, whereas no such effect was detected in Laminarin treatment. Mechanistically, high-dose Paramylon activates the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, with significantly up-regulation of intrinsic apoptosis-related genes and impaired mitochondrial function. On the other hand, Laminarin triggers metabolic reprogramming in MФ, resulting in the enrichment of the metabolite α-Ketoglutarate, which protects the MФ from apoptosis. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of identifying the optimal dose range for β-Glucans, based on sources or structures, to achieve maximal immunomodulatory effects. These results have important implications for the design and optimization of β-Glucans-based drugs or adjuvants in immunotherapies.",

      "abstract": "Among the most important sources of β-glucans are edible and medicinal mushrooms. These molecules are components of the cellular wall of basidiomycete fungi (mushrooms) and can be extracted even from the basidiocarp as the mycelium and its cultivation extracts or biomasses. Mushroom β-glucans are recognized by their potential effects as immunostimulants and immunosuppressants. They are highlighted as anticholesterolemic, anti-inflammatory, adjuvant in diabetes mellitus, mycotherapy for cancer treatment, as well as adjuvants for COVID-19 vaccines. Due to their relevance, several techniques of β-glucans extraction, purification, and analysis have already been described. Despite the previous knowledge of β-glucans' benefits for human nutrition and health, the main information about this topic refers to the molecular identification, properties, and benefits, as well as their synthesis and action on cells. Studies on biotechnology industry applications (product development) and the registered products of β-glucans from mushrooms are still limited and more common for feed and healthcare. In this context, this paper reviews the biotechnological production of food products containing β-glucans from basidiomycete fungi, focusing on food enrichment, and presents a new perspective on fungi β-glucans' use as potential immunotherapy agents. KEY POINTS: • Mushrooms' β-glucans for product development in the biotechnology industry • Biotechnological production of food products containing mushrooms' β-glucans • Basidiomycete fungi β-glucans are used as potential immunotherapy agents.",

      "abstract": "The prognosis in cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with current treatment modalities is poor owing to the highly desmoplastic tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, a β-glucans-functionalized zinc-doxorubicin nanoparticle system (βGlus-ZnD NPs) that can be orally administered, is developed for targeted PDAC therapy. Following oral administration in PDAC-bearing mice, βGlus-ZnD NPs actively target/transpass microfold cells, overcome the intestinal epithelial barrier, and then undergo subsequent phagocytosis by endogenous macrophages (βGlus-ZnD@Mϕ). As hitchhiking cellular vehicles, βGlus-ZnD@Mϕ transits through the intestinal lymphatic system and enters systemic circulation, ultimately accumulating in the tumor tissue as a result of the tumor-homing and \"stealth\" properties that are conferred by endogenous Mϕ. Meanwhile, the Mϕ that hitchhikes βGlus-ZnD NPs is activated to produce matrix metalloproteinases, destroying the desmoplastic stromal barrier, and differentiates toward the M1 -like phenotype, modulating the TME and recruiting effector T cells, ultimately inducing apoptosis of the tumor cells. The combination of βGlus-ZnD@Mϕ and immune checkpoint blockade effectively inhibits the growth of the primary tumor and suppresses the development of metastasis. It thus represents an appealing approach to targeted PDAC therapy.",

We herein investigated whether P-glucans promote the immunological effects of antibody drugs against malignant tumor cells using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Rituximab bound to CD20-specific lymphoma and exhibited cytotoxic activity in the presence of human mononuclear cells, but not neutrophils. The addition of Sparassis crispa (cauliflower mushroom)-derived β-glucan (SCG) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to co-cultures of PBMCs and Raji lymphoma cells further promoted antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The GM-CSF treatment increased β-glucan receptor expression on adherent cells in PBMCs. A co-stimulation with GM-CSF and SCG of PBMCs induced an increase in the number of spreading cells and the activation of natural killer (NK) cells. The enhancement in ADCC was abolished by the removal of NK cells, indicating that SCG and GM-CSF increased ADCC against lymphoma by activating β-glucan receptor-expressing cells in PBMCs and enhancing NK cell activity. The synergistic mechanisms of action of mushroom-derived β-glucans and biopharmaceuticals, including recombinant cytokines and antibodies, in the treatment of malignant tumor cells provide important insights into the clinical efficacy of β-glucans from mushrooms.",

      "abstract": "This experiment evaluated the impact of the dietary addition of 1,3-β-glucans (GLU) on broiler chickens’ growth, intestinal histology, blood biochemical parameters, and immunity. Two hundred three-day-old male broilers (Ross 308) (97.93 ± 0.19 g/chick) were randomly assigned into four treatments with five replicates, each containing ten birds, in a complete randomized design. The four treatments were formulated with 0, 50, 100, and 150 mg 1,3-β-glucans kg−1 in broiler chicken diets. During the study, no significant impacts (p > 0.05) were observed in weight gain and feed conversion ratio (FCR) between treatment groups. Based on the results of total body weight gain and FCR, the optimal level of 1,3-β-glucan is 120 mg Kg−1. The intestinal histomorphology was improved by GLU supplementation, as indicated by increased villi height and villi height to crypt depth ratio (p < 0.01). All levels of supplemental β-1,3 glucan decreased the serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride levels, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (p < 0.05). The serum levels of growth hormones (GH), triiodothyronine (T3), and thyroxine (T4) were increased in GLU-supplemented groups (p < 0.05). The serum immune indices (lysozyme activity, interleukin 10 (IL10), complement 3 (C3), and total protein levels) were increased in the GLU-supplemented groups (p < 0.05). Dietary GLU up-regulated the immunoexpression of CD3 (T-cell marker) and CD20 (B-cell marker) in the spleen of birds (p < 0.01). It can be concluded that 1,3-β-glucan can be added to broiler chicken diets for improving the development and integrity of the intestine and enhancing the bird’s immune status. The optimal level for 1,3-β-glucan dietary supplementation was 120 mg Kg−1. Dietary 1,3-β-glucan has a hypolipidemic effect and improves the hormonal profile of birds without affecting their growth rate."

      "abstract": "Studies have shown that β-glucans extracted from the cell wall of cereals, algae, and yeasts have been associated with improved immune function. However, it is unknown whether algae β-glucan supplementation affects the performance, blood metabolites, or cell counts of immune cells in dairy calves. The objective of this randomized clinical trial was to evaluate whether supplementation of β-glucans to milk replacer in dairy calves fed 6 L/d improved growth performance and fecal status and altered the blood metabolite profile. In this trial, we enrolled Holstein calves (n = 34) at birth (body weight 36.38 ± 1.33 kg; mean ± standard deviation) to receive, from 1 d of age, either 2 g/d algae β-glucans mixed into 6 L/d of milk replacer (22.4% crude protein and 16.2% fat) or an unsupplemented milk replacer (control). The calves were blocked in pairs according to birth weight, sex, and date of birth (up to 5 d difference). Calves were housed individually, and calf starter (24.7% crude protein and 13.9% neutral detergent fiber) was offered ad libitum based on orts of the previous day until 56 d of age (end of the trial). Body weight was measured weekly, and health checks and daily fecal consistency were evaluated daily in every calf by the same observer. Calves with 2 consecutive days of loose feces that sifted through bedding were considered diarrhea positive. We used a linear mixed effects model to evaluate the effects of β-glucan supplementation fed during the preweaning period on performance (average daily gain), final weight, feed efficiency (FE), white blood cell count, and selected blood metabolites, repeated by time. A generalized linear mixed effects model was also run to evaluate the likelihood of a diarrhea bout in the first 28 d of life, controlling for the calf as the subject with a logistic distribution. We included age, serum total protein at 48 h, and birth weight as covariates. At 56 d, β-glucan-supplemented calves weighed more than control calves (56.3 vs. 51.5 kg). Treatment had no effect on total starter intake, but there was a treatment by age interaction for FE, with greater FE for β-glucan-supplemented calves in wk 3 and 5 of age. There was only a tendency for average daily gain to be greater in supplemented calves than in control calves for the duration of the study. Furthermore, control calves had 14.66 [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 9.87-21.77] times greater odds of having a diarrheal bout than β-glucan-supplemented calves. Control calves had 12.70 (95% CI: 8.82-18.28) times greater odds of having an additional day with an abnormal fecal score compared with β-glucan-supplemented calves, suggesting that supplementation ameliorated diarrhea severity. We found no association of treatment with concentrations of serum total protein, albumin, creatinine, or glucose during the preweaning period. Our findings suggest that dietary supplementation of 2 g/d of algae β-glucans to milk replacer improved fecal status and may affect growth, as evidenced by a higher weaning weight, compared with control calves. Future studies should explore the effect of algae β-glucans on lower-gut physiology and digestibility in dairy calves.",

They are mainly synthesized by fungi, plants, seaweed and bacteria, where they carry out structural, protective and energy storage roles. Because of their unique physicochemical properties, they have important applications in several industrial, biomedical and biotechnological processes. β-glucans are also major bioactive molecules with marked immunomodulatory and metabolic properties. As such, they have been the focus of many studies attesting to their ability to, among other roles, fight cancer, reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases and control diabetes. The physicochemical and functional profiles of β-glucans are deeply influenced by their molecular structure. This structure governs β-glucan interaction with multiple β-glucan binding proteins, triggering myriad biological responses. It is then imperative to understand the structural properties of β-glucans to fully reveal their biological roles and potential applications. The deconstruction of β-glucans is a result of β-glucanase activity. In addition to being invaluable tools for the study of β-glucans, these enzymes have applications in numerous biotechnological and industrial processes, both alone and in conjunction with their natural substrates. Here, we review potential applications for β-glucans and β-glucanases, and explore how their functionalities are dictated by their structure.",

      "abstract": "In this work, bio-based membranes prepared using a crosslinked β-glucans-chitosan dispersed in the chitosan matrix useful in promoting wound healing were studied for the first-time. Wound healing is a process that includes sequential steps designed to restore the structure and function of damaged cells and tissue. To minimize damage and the risk of infection during the healing process and to promote restoration of the integrity of damaged tissue, the wound should be dressed. Generally, according to their function in the wound, dressings are classified on the basis of type of material and physical form. The substances used to make a dressing are generally natural polymers such as hydrocolloids, alginates, polyurethane, collagen, chitosan, pectin and hyaluronic acid. The combination of polymeric substances, with antibacterial and antioxidant properties, could be exploited in the biomedical field for the development of biocompatible materials able to act as a barrier between the wound and the external environment, protecting the site from bacterial contamination and promoting healing. To this aim, bio-based membranes were prepared by the phase inversion induced by solvent evaporation, using the crosslinked β-glucans-chitosan obtained by esterification reactions as a functional additive in the chitosan membrane. The reaction intermediates and the final products were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) while the morphological properties of membranes were analyzed using electronic scanning microscopy (SEM). The chemical bonding between chitosan and β-glucans allowed for the obtainment of a better dispersion of the combined new material into the membrane's matrix and as a consequence, an enhanced antibacterial property evaluated through in vitro tests, with respect to the starting materials."

      "abstract": "Nutraceuticals based on plant extracts rich in polyphenols, as well as dietary fibres, are new means to fight overweight/obesity and associated diseases. However, to understand the potential effects of polyphenols on health it is critical to study their bioavailability and metabolic fate. Consumption of a green coffee phenolic extract (GCPE) in combination with oat beta-glucan (BG) could affect the pharmacokinetic profile of the main polyphenols present in coffee (hydroxycinnamates). Moreover, the regular intake of the combination could also induce changes. Nine overweight men and women consumed a novel nutraceutical product containing 300 mg of green coffee hydroxycinnamic acids and 2.5 g of BG twice a day for 8 weeks. A pharmacokinetic study was carried out in blood and urine samples taken before (baseline) and at week 8 after the nutraceutical intervention, collecting samples at different times in a 0-24 h interval. Faecal samples were also obtained at 0 and 24 h after the intake of the nutraceutical at baseline and week 8. Phenolic metabolites were analysed by LC-MS-QToF. Results showed that polyphenols were differentially absorbed and extensively metabolized throughout the gastrointestinal tract. An apparent reduction in the excretion of small intestinal metabolites was accompanied by a tendency to increase colonic metabolites after sustained intake (p = 0.052). In conclusion, continued consumption of the GCPE/BG nutraceutical appears to enhance the absorption of hydroxycinnamates by increasing the colonic bioavailability of their derived metabolites compared to baseline, although the regular intake of the nutraceutical did not modify the metabolite profile in any of the biological samples.",

A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to verify whether the consumption of yeast beta-glucan (BG) favors weight loss in obese and non-obese rodents. The PICO strategy was employed, investigating rodents (Population), subjected to the oral administration of yeast BG (Intervention) compared to animals receiving placebo (Comparison), evaluating body weight changes (Outcome), and based on preclinical studies (Study design). Two reviewers searched six databases and the grey literature. We followed the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, and the protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021267788). The search returned 2467 articles. Thirty articles were selected for full-text evaluation, and seven studies remained based on the eligibility criteria. The effects of BG intake on body weight were analyzed based on obese (n = 4 studies) and non-obese animals (n = 4 studies). Even though most studies on obese rodents (75%) indicated a reduction in body weight (qualitative analysis), the meta-analysis showed this was not significant (mean difference -1.35 g-95% CI -5.14:2.45). No effects were also observed for non-obese animals. We concluded that the ingestion of yeast BG barely affects the body weight of obese and non-obese animals.",

A practical commercial diet was used as the control (CTRL), and three others based on CTRL were further supplemented with different β-glucan extracts. One was derived from S. cerevisiae (diet MG) and two different extracts of 21% and 37% P. tricornutum-derived β-glucans (defined as Phaeo21 and Phaeo37), to give a final 0.06% β-glucan dietary concentration. Quadruplicate groups of 95 gilthead seabream (initial body weight: 4.1 ± 0.1 g) were fed to satiation three times a day for 8 weeks in a pulse-feeding regimen, with experimental diets intercalated with the CTRL dietary treatment every 2 weeks. After 8 weeks of feeding, all groups showed equal growth performance and no changes were found in plasma innate immune status. Nonetheless, fish groups fed β-glucans supplemented diets showed an improved anti-oxidant status compared to those fed CTRL at both sampling points (i.e., 2 and 8 weeks). The intestinal gene expression analysis highlighted the immunomodulatory role of Phaeo37 diet after 8 weeks, inducing an immune tolerance effect in gilthead seabream intestine, and a general down-regulation of immune-related gene expression. In conclusion, the results suggest that the dietary pulse administration of a P. tricornutum 37% enriched-β-glucans extract might be used as a counter-measure in a context of gut inflammation, due to its immune-tolerant and anti-oxidative effects.",

Reduced energy intake and increased physical activity interventions have limited success in the long term. Nutraceuticals might be an alternative means to help lose weight and reduce obesity-associated cardiometabolic risk factors without changes in the habitual diet. The objective of the present study was to comparatively evaluate the efficiency of nutraceuticals based on the combination of a decaffeinated green coffee bean extract (GCBE) and two types of oat beta-glucans (BG) with different physiochemical properties on obesity related biomarkers in overweight/obese subjects. A randomized, dose-response, parallel, blind study was carried out in four groups of subjects (n = 15 each) who consumed for 6 weeks, twice a day, a nutraceutical containing 3 g d-1 or 5 g d-1 doses of 35% or 70% BG and a fixed amount of GCBE providing 600 mg d-1 of phenols. 35% BG showed a 10 and 100 times higher molecular weight and viscosity, respectively, compared to 70% BG. Food intake, anthropometry and different cardiometabolic markers were assessed at the beginning and end of the intervention. According to the general model of variance with repeated measure analysis, the intervention caused positive changes in the levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, haemoglobin A1c, insulin, systolic blood pressure (SBP), total body fat percentage (TBF%), visceral fat percentage, and waist and hip circumferences without differences among the treatments, except for SBP and TBF%. Looking into the rates of change [(end value - beginning value)/beginning value] of these parameters, 5 g - 70% BG was the treatment that lowered TBF% the most. In conclusion, 5 g - 70% BG may be more effective in helping to lose weight and additionally, it produced the least bloating according to participants' subjective perception.",

At the moment, vaccination is the most effective strategy in the fight against pandemic. Vaccines can be administered with different natural biological products (adjuvants) with immunomodulating properties. Adjuvants can be taken orally, complementing vaccine action. Adjuvant compounds could play a key role in alleviating the symptoms of the disease, as well as in enhancing vaccine action. Adjuvants also contribute to an effective immune response and can enhance the protective effect of vaccines in immunocompromised individuals such as the elderly. Adjuvants must not produce adverse effects, toxicity, or any other symptoms that could alter immune system function. Vaccine adjuvants are substances of wide varying chemical structure that are used to boost the immune response against a simultaneously administered antigen. Glucans could work as adjuvants due to their immunomodulatory biological activity. In this respect, β-(1,3)-(1,6) glucans are considered the most effective and safe according to the list issued by the European Commission. Only glucans with a β-(1,3) bond linked to a β-(1,6) are considered modulators of certain biological responses. The aim of this review is to present the possible effects of β-glucans as adjuvants in the efficacy of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 virus.",

They are known for their metabolic and immunomodulatory properties, including anticancer, antibacterial, and antiviral. Recent reports suggest a potential of beta-glucans in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. In contrast to β-glucans from other sources, β-glucans from mushrooms are characterized by β-1,3-glucans with short β-1,6-side chains. This structure is recognized by receptors located on the surface of immune cells; thus, mushroom β-glucans have specific immunomodulatory properties and gained BRM (biological response modifier) status. Moreover, mushroom beta-glucans also owe their properties to the formation of triple helix conformation, which is one of the key factors influencing the bioactivity of mushroom beta-glucans. This review summarizes the latest findings on biological and health-promoting potential of mushroom beta-glucans for the treatment of civilization and viral diseases, with particular emphasis on COVID-19.",

After in vitro fermentation, fermentation supernatants (FSs) and/or -pellets (FPs) were analyzed regarding the concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), ammonia, bile acids, the relative abundance of bacterial taxa and chemopreventive effects (growth inhibition, apoptosis, genotoxicity) in LT97 colon adenoma cells. Compared to other glucans, the highest CBC was determined for oat β-glucan (65.9 ± 8.8 mg g-1, p < 0.05). Concentrations of SCFA were increased in FSs of all β-glucans (up to 2.7-fold). The lowest concentrations of ammonia (down to 0.8 ± 0.3 mmol L-1) and bile acids (2.5-5.2 μg mL-1) were detected in FSs of the β-glucans from oat, barley, yeast, and curdlan. The various β-glucans differentially modulated the relative abundance of bacteria families and reduced the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. Treatment of LT97 cells with the FSs led to a significant dose-dependent growth reduction and increase in caspase-3 activity without exhibiting genotoxic effects. Though the different β-glucans show different fermentation profiles as well as cholesterol- and bile acid-reducing properties, they exhibit comparable chemopreventive effects.",

The study enrolled 48 people of both genders of different ages recruited from 129 patients with a gastritis diagnosis. Before and after the therapy, hematological, biochemical, immunological and redox balance parameters were determined in the blood and the number of lactic acid bacteria and SCFA concentrations in the feces. Our results demonstrated a beneficial effect of oat beta-glucans with high molar mass in chronic gastritis in humans, resulting in reduced mucosal damage and healthy changes in SCFA fecal concentration and peripheral blood serum glutathione metabolism and antioxidant defense parameters. This fraction of a highly purified oat beta-glucan is safe for humans. Its action is effective after 30 days of use, which sheds new light on the nutritional treatment of chronic gastritis.",

Due to the high number of deaths (almost 152,000) related to this cancer, it seems that novel efficient therapeutic methods are required in this field. Beta-glucans are a type of glucose linear polymers which have been proven to have a lot of advantageous activities. Recently, investigations have declared that these polysaccharides have the potential to be used as anti-cancer drugs. These agents are able to affect several mechanisms such as inflammation and apoptosis, and that is how cancers are prone to be affected by them. In this review, we attempt to investigate the role of beta-glucans on ovarian cancer. We hope that this paper would give some novel insights into the field of ovarian cancer treatment.",

Ephrin type-A receptor 2 (EphA2) has been previously identified as a lung epithelial pattern recognition receptor that binds to fungal β-glucans. Herein, we also report that EphA2 can also bind Pneumocystis β-glucans, both in isolated forms and also on exposed surfaces of the organism. Furthermore, binding of Pneumocystis β-glucans resulted in phosphorylation of the EphA2 receptor, which has been shown to be important for downstream proinflammatory response. Indeed, we also show that interleukin 6 cytokine is significantly increased when lung epithelial cells are exposed to Pneumocystis β-glucans, and that this response could be blocked by preincubation with a specific antibody to EphA2. Our study presents another Pneumocystis lung epithelial cell receptor with implications for initial colonization and possible therapeutic intervention.",

Massive demands of G. lucidum have fascinated the researchers towards its application as functional food, nutraceutical and modern medicine owing to wide range of application in various diseases include immunomodulators, anticancer, antiviral, antioxidant, cardioprotective, hepatoprotective. G. lucidum polysaccharides exhibit immunomodulatory properties through boosting the action of antigen-presenting cells, mononuclear phagocyte system, along with humoral and cellular immunity. β-Glucans isolated from G. lucidum are anticipated to produce an immune response through pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). β-Glucans after binding with dectin-1 receptor present on different cells include macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells and neutrophils produce signal transduction that lead to trigger the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), T cells and Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) that refer to cytokines production and contributing to immune response. While triterpenoids produce antiviral effects through inhibiting various enzymes like neuraminidase, HIV-protease, DENV2 NS2B-NS3 protease and HSV multiplication. Polysaccharides and triterpenoids adjunct to other drugs exhibit potential action in prevention and treatment of various diseases.

      "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked neuromuscular childhood disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness and degeneration. A lack of dystrophin in DMD leads to inflammatory response, autophagic dysregulation, and oxidative stress in skeletal muscle fibers that play a key role in the progression of the pathology. β-glucans can modulate immune function by modifying the phagocytic activity of immunocompetent cells, notably macrophages. Mitochondrial function is also involved in an important mechanism of the innate and adaptive immune responses, owing to high need for energy of immune cells. In the present study, the effects of 1,3-1,6 β-glucans on five-day-old non-dystrophic and dystrophic (sapje) zebrafish larvae were investigated. The effects of the sonication of β-glucans and the dechorionation of embryos were also evaluated. The results showed that the incidence of dystrophic phenotypes was reduced when dystrophic embryos were exposed to 2 and 4 mg L-1 of 1,3-1,6 β-glucans. Moreover, when the dystrophic larvae underwent 8 mg L-1 treatment, an improvement of the locomotor performances and mitochondrial respiration were observed. In conclusion, the observed results demonstrated that 1,3-1,6 β-glucans improve locomotor performances and mitochondrial function in dystrophic zebrafish. Therefore, for ameliorating their life quality, 1,3-1,6 β-glucans look like a promising diet supplement for DMD patients, even though further investigations are required.",

In macrophages, the hormone modulates both phagocytic activity and cytokine production; therefore, it plays an important role in mediating the innate immune response to infection. The immunomodulatory properties of beta-glucans are attributed to the ability of these fungal cell wall polysaccharides to bind to different receptors expressed on the cell surface of phagocytic and cytotoxic innate immune cells, including monocytes and macrophages. The intracellular signaling pathways activated by beta-glucans lead to enhanced phagocytosis and cytokine response. In this study we investigated the possible potentiation of immunomodulatory properties of the combined treatment with vitamin D and beta-glucans. The effects of 100 nM 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or 100 µg/mL beta-glucans were evaluated in human macrophages in terms of cytokine production, intracellular vesicle acidification and changes in energy metabolism, three hallmarks of macrophage antimicrobial activation. We found that all the analyzed parameters were enhanced by the co-treatment compared to the response to single molecules. The results of this study support the validity of a novel therapeutic approach that could boost the immune response, taking advantage of the synergy between two natural compounds.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The incidence of Crohn's disease (CD) is increasing worldwide, and it has currently become a serious public health issue in society. The treatment of CD continues throughout a patient's lifetime, and therefore, it is necessary to develop new, effective treatment methods, including dietotherapy. The present study aimed to determine the effects of consumption of oat beta-glucans with different molar mass on colon inflammation (colitis) in the early stages of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced CD in an animal model. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats (control and TNBS-induced CD) were divided into three dietary groups and fed for 3 days (reflecting acute inflammation) or 7 days (reflecting remission) with a feed containing 1% low (βGl) or high (βGh) molar mass oat beta-glucan or a feed without this polysaccharide. The level of colon inflammatory markers and the expression of cytokines and their receptor genes were measured by ELISA and RT-PCR methods, respectively. RESULTS: Acute inflammation or remission (3 or 7 days after TNBS administration, respectively) stages of experimentally induced CD were characterized by an increase in the level of inflammatory markers (IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, TNF-α, CRP, MPO, COX, and PGE2) and the disruption of some cytokine signaling pathways as well as macro- and microscopic changes of colon tissue. The consumption of oat beta-glucans reduced the level of inflammatory markers and recovered the signaling pathways and histological changes, with stronger effects of βGl after 7 days of colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary oat beta-glucans can reduce colitis at the molecular and organ level and accelerate CD remission.",

This review discusses the biological effects of β-glucans on bone metabolisms, especially on bone-resorbing osteoclasts, which are differentiated from hematopoietic precursors. Multiple immunoreceptors that can recognize β-glucans were reported to be expressed in osteoclast precursors. Coordinated co-stimulatory signals mediated by these immunoreceptors are important for the regulation of osteoclastogenesis and bone remodeling. Curdlan from the bacterium Alcaligenes faecalis negatively regulates osteoclast differentiation in vitro by affecting both the osteoclast precursors and osteoclast-supporting cells. We also showed that laminarin, lichenan, and glucan from baker's yeast, as well as β-1,3-glucan from Euglema gracilisas, inhibit the osteoclast formation in bone marrow cells. Consistent with these findings, systemic and local administration of β-glucan derived from Aureobasidium pullulans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae suppressed bone resorption in vivo. However, zymosan derived from S. cerevisiae stimulated the bone resorption activity and is widely used to induce arthritis in animal models. Additional research concerning the relationship between the molecular structure of β-glucan and its effect on osteoclastic bone resorption will be beneficial for the development of novel treatment strategies for bone-related diseases.",

The aim of the present study was to use a systematic review and meta-analysis approach to investigate the effects of yeast β-glucans for the prevention and treatment of URTIs in healthy subjects. METHODS: Databases including Pubmed, Web of Science, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library were searched and 13 RCTs investigating the effects of yeast β-glucans on the incidence, duration, and severity of URTIs in healthy subjects were included. RESULTS: The results showed that compared to the placebo group, yeast β-glucan could significantly reduce the incidence of URTIs (OR = 0.345, 95% CI = 0.192 to 0.620, p < 0.001), decrease the average number of URTI episodes (SMD =  - 0.315, 95% CI =  - 0.500 to  - 0.130, p < 0.05), and decrease the duration of URTIs (SMD =  - 0.312, 95% CI =  - 0.561 to  - 0.064, p < 0.001). Improved severity of symptoms was found in yeast β-glucan group compared to the placebo group in the majority of included studies. In addition, yeast β-glucan was well tolerated and safe in general. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a positive effect of yeast β-glucans on human URTIs. However, due to the high heterogeneity and small number of included studies, more high-quality research and clinical trials are warranted.",

      "abstract": "Following an application from Nestlé S.A. submitted for authorisation of a health claim pursuant to Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 via the Competent Authority of Belgium, the EFSA Panel on Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens (NDA) was asked to deliver an opinion on the scientific substantiation of a health claim related to beta-glucans from oats and/or barley in a ready-to-eat cereal manufactured via pressure cooking and reduction of blood glucose rise after consumption. The scope of the application was proposed to fall under a health claim based on newly developed scientific evidence. The food proposed is 'beta-glucans from oats and/or barley incorporated into ready-to-eat breakfast cereals manufactured via pressure cooking'. The applicant proposed that at least 1.3 g of beta-glucans/25 g of available carbohydrates in ready-to-eat breakfast cereals manufactured via pressure cooking should be consumed. Beta-glucans from oats, barley or any combination thereof incorporated into ready-to-eat cereals manufactured by pressure cooking, are sufficiently characterised. The claimed effect proposed is 'reduction of the blood glucose rise after the meal'. The reduction of post-prandial glycaemic responses (as long as post-prandial insulinaemic responses are not disproportionally increased) may be a beneficial physiological effect. One human intervention study showed an effect of beta-glucans from oats and/or barley, incorporated into breakfast cereals manufactured via pressure cooking at a level of at least 1.2 g/25 g available carbohydrates, on decreasing post-prandial glycaemic responses without disproportionally increasing insulinaemic responses. Dose-response relationships were not tested, and no evidence has been provided that beta-glucans incorporated into cereals processed using pressure cooking would exert a higher effect on post-prandial glucose responses than beta-glucans added to other carbohydrate containing foods. Whereas the effect of beta-glucans in reducing post-prandial blood glucose responses is well established, the evidence provided is insufficient to establish such an effect at doses of 1.3 g beta-glucans per 25 g of available carbohydrate incorporated into ready-to-eat breakfast cereals manufactured via pressure cooking (i.e. either batch cooking or extrusion)."

      "abstract": "Conventional vaccines to combat COVID-19 through different approaches are at various stages of development. The complexity of COVID-19 such as the potential mutations of the virus leading to antigenic drift and the uncertainty on the duration of the immunity induced by the vaccine have hampered the efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, we suggest an alternative interim treatment strategy based on biological response modifier glucans such as the Aureobasidium pullulans AFO-202-derived β-glucan, which has been reported to induce trained immunity, akin to that induced by the Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine, by epigenetic modifications at the central level in the bone marrow. These β-glucans act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns, activating mucosal immunity by binding with specific pathogen recognition receptors such as dectin-1 and inducing both the adaptive and innate immunity by reaching distant lymphoid organs. β-Glucans have also been used as immune adjuvants for vaccines such as the influenza vaccine. Therefore, until a conventional vaccine is widely available, an orally consumable vaccine adjuvant that acts like biosimilars, termed as the wide-spectrum immune-balancing food-supplement-based enteric (β-WIFE) vaccine adjuvant approach, with well-reported safety is worth in-depth investigation and can be considered for a clinical trial.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract with alternating periods of exacerbation and remission. The aim of this study was to determine the time-dependent effects of dietary oat beta-glucans on colon apoptosis and autophagy in the CD rat model. METHODS: A total of 150 Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two main groups: healthy control (H) and a TNBS (2,4,6-trinitrobenzosulfonic acid)-induced colitis (C) group, both including subgroups fed with feed without beta-glucans (βG-) or feed supplemented with low- (βGl) or high-molar-mass oat beta-glucans (βGh) for 3, 7, or 21 days. The expression of autophagy (LC3B) and apoptosis (Caspase-3) markers, as well as Toll-like (TLRs) and Dectin-1 receptors, in the colon epithelial cells, was determined using immunohistochemistry and Western blot. RESULTS: The results showed that in rats with colitis, after 3 days of induction of inflammation, the expression of Caspase-3 and LC3B in intestinal epithelial cells did not change, while that of TLR 4 and Dectin-1 decreased. Beta-glucan supplementation caused an increase in the expression of TLR 5 and Dectin-1 with no changes in the expression of Caspase-3 and LC3B. After 7 days, a high expression of Caspase-3 was observed in the colitis-induced animals without any changes in the expression of LC3B and TLRs, and simultaneously, a decrease in Dectin-1 expression was observed. The consumption of feed with βGl or βGh resulted in a decrease in Caspase-3 expression and an increase in TLR 5 expression in the CβGl group, with no change in the expression of LC3B and TLR 4. After 21 days, the expression of Caspase-3 and TLRs was not changed by colitis, while that of LC3B and Dectin-1 was decreased. Feed supplementation with βGh resulted in an increase in the expression of both Caspase-3 and LC3B, while the consumption of feed with βGh and βGl increased Dectin-1 expression. However, regardless of the type of nutritional intervention, the expression of TLRs did not change after 21 days. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary intake of βGl and βGh significantly reduced colitis by time-dependent modification of autophagy and apoptosis, with βGI exhibiting a stronger effect on apoptosis and βGh on autophagy. The mechanism of this action may be based on the activation of TLRs and Dectin-1 receptor and depends on the period of exacerbation or remission of CD.",

      "abstract": "Fungal compounds have long been used for centuries as food supplements. β-glucans have been identified as the most interesting molecules with beneficial effects in several chronic diseases. In vitro studies have shown that they are able to elicit the immune cells maturation and activation with the result of an increased release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and a stimulation of anti-bacterial activity of macrophages and neutrophils. As β-glucans enhance pathogen elimination through non-self antigens identification, they can also direct immune response against tumor cells. These compounds also stimulate the activity on adaptive immune cells and they have been regarded as biological response modifiers. In this way, β-glucans can be exploited as adjuvant cancer therapy, in particular by a synergic action with chemotherapy or immunotherapy. In the immuno-oncology era, the need is to identify innovative drugs that can simultaneously target and inhibit different biological processes relevant for cancer cells survivors. Recent clinical studies showed promising results about the combination of β-glucans and immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients affected by different solid tumors. This review aims to investigate molecular mechanisms of action of β-glucans and is focused on their application in clinical practice as immune-adjuvants for treatment of cancer patients."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Fungal β-glucans have been considered as biological response modifiers (BRMs) promoting stimulation of immune system according to numerous scientific publications performed in vitro and in vivo. Some clinical trials involving such compounds started to be published since 1980's. This systematic review aimed to compile and compare clinical studies using these β-glucans as adjuvants on patients undergoing cancer treatment. Healthy subjects and β-glucans from other sources were excluded. METHODS: It was developed according to PRISMA-P guidelines (PROSPERO registered n. CRD42020151539), using PICO criteria and the following databases: PubMed, Scielo and LILACS. RESULTS: We found 1018 articles and after removing duplicated records, select by title/abstract and full-text, only 9 studies remained and 7 more were manually added, totalizing 16 trials involving 1650 patients, with arm sizes varying from 9 until 200 patients. The selected studies (published since 1992-2018) included subjects with diagnosis of 9 types of cancer. The studies used different sources of β-glucans, such as yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), mushrooms (Lentinula edodes and Schizophyllum commune) and non-described fungal sources. CONCLUSIONS: It was observed that the administration of β-glucan is safe and well-tolerated. Most of the trials pointed that concomitant administration of β-glucan with chemo or radiotherapy reduced the immune depression caused by such treatments and/or accelerated the recovery of white blood cells counts. However, some articles also commented that no statistical difference was encountered between β-glucan treated vs. control groups, which gives a controversial conclusion about the β-glucan effects. The great diversity among the methodology studies and insufficient information was an impeditive for achieving profound statistical analysis, therefore a narrative report of the included studies was performed indicating that further evidences are required to determine the efficacy of this adjuvant in the cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "Piglets are susceptible to infections in early life and around weaning due to rapid environmental and dietary changes. A compelling target to improve pig health in early life is diet, as it constitutes a pivotal determinant of gut microbial colonization and maturation of the host's immune system. In the present study, we investigated how supplementation of yeast-derived β-glucans affects the gut microbiota and immune function pre- and post-weaning, and how these complex systems develop over time. From day two after birth until two weeks after weaning, piglets received yeast-derived β-glucans or a control treatment orally and were subsequently vaccinated against Salmonella Typhimurium. Faeces, digesta, blood, and tissue samples were collected to study gut microbiota composition and immune function. Overall, yeast-derived β-glucans did not affect the vaccination response, and only modest effects on faecal microbiota composition and immune parameters were observed, primarily before weaning. This study demonstrates that the pre-weaning period offers a 'window of opportunity' to alter the gut microbiota and immune system through diet. However, the observed changes were modest, and any long-lasting effects of yeast-derived β-glucans remain to be elucidated."

Various studies have shown that the β-glucans of Pleurotus ostreatus have diverse biological properties including antioxidant and anticancer activities. Methods: β-glucans were obtained by alkaline-acid hydrolysis from Pleurotus ostreatus, and their content was characterized by liquid chromatography. To evaluate the effect of β-glucans on the expression of glutathione, Balb/c mice were used, and 4 test groups were established. All groups were fed as usual, groups treated with acrylamide were administered the compound intragastrically at a concentration of 50 g/mL, and β-glucan treatment was given at a concentration of 50 g/mL. Results: no mortality was observed after exposure to the tested dose of acrylamide; only signs of peripheral neuropathy such as hyperactivity and tremors were observed after five days of experimentation, and were maintained over 30 days after the experiment. On the other hand, an increase in lipid peroxidation levels was observed in the livers of the acrylamide-treated mice, which were lower in the mice treated with β-glucans. Conclusions: results show that β-glucans may act as antioxidant agents able to protect the liver against oxidative stress as caused by the intake of acrylamide.",

      "abstract": "β-Glucans have long been used as an immunostimulant in aquaculture. However, the relationship of its structure to its immunomodulatory properties are poorly understood. In this study, the particle size and chemical structure of β-glucans extracted from wild-type strain of baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and its null-mutant yeasts Gas1 were characterised. Using Sigma β-glucan as a reference, the immunomodulatory properties of these polysaccharides in the germ-free Artemia franciscana model system in the presence of Vibrio harveyi bacterial challenge were investigated. The survival of the A. franciscana nauplii, upon challenge with V. harveyi, was significantly higher in all three glucan-treated groups compared to the control. The glucan Gas1 with a lower degree of branching and shorter side chain length had the most prominent V. harveyi-protective effects. The particle size did not affect the nauplii survival when challenged with V. harveyi. Results also showed that the salutary effect of the tested glucans was associated with the upregulation of innate immune genes such as lipopolysaccharide and β-1,3-glucan-binding protein (lgbp), high mobility group box protein (hmgb), and prophenoloxidase (proPO). Interestingly, the up-regulation of superoxidase dismutase (sod) and glutathione-s-transferase (gst) was only observed in Gas1 treated group, indicating that Gas1 could function to induce higher reactive oxygen species and stronger immunomodulatory function in A. franciscana, and therefore higher survival rate. The expression of heat shock protein 70 (hsp70), peroxinectin (pxn), and down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (dscam) remain unaltered in response to glucan treatment. Taken together, this study provides insights into the structure-function relationship of β-glucan and the results confirmed that β-glucan can be an effective immunostimulant in aquaculture, especially the Gas1 glucan.",

      "abstract": "The search for lipid-lowering drugs is important for clinical medicine. This review summarizes our research findings regarding the hypolipidemic activity of polysaccharides. There are several validated agents altering lipid levels which reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events. Nonetheless, for many people, the risk of such an event remains unacceptably high despite treatment with these agents. This situation has prompted the search for new therapies to reduce the residual cardiovascular risk. The lipid-lowering effect of β-glucans consumed with food was demonstrated in patients with atherosclerosis. The mechanism of the protective effect of β-glucans is poorly studied. The effects of β-glucans are mediated by Toll-like receptors, by dectin-1, and possibly by other receptors. Nevertheless, the mechanism of the protective action of β-glucan in lipemic mice has been studied insufficiently. This review will present up-to-date information regarding experimental hypolipidemic polysaccharide compounds that hold promise for medicine. Phagocyte-specific chitotriosidase in humans contributes to innate immune responses against chitin-containing fungi. This enzyme has been first described in patients with Gaucher disease and serves as an important diagnostic biomarker. It has been reported that, in mice, chitin particles of certain size are recognized by macrophages through Toll-like receptors, dectin-1, and to a lesser extent through mannose receptor.",

Our laboratories were the first to demonstrate that radiolabeled microorganism-specific monoclonal antibodies are highly effective for treatment of experimental fungal, bacterial and viral infections. Later we proposed to utilize surface expressed pan-antigens shared by major IFI-causing pathogens such as beta-glucans as RIT targets. Here we evaluated in vivo RIT targeting beta-glucan in Blastomyces dermatitidis which causes serious infections in immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals and in companion dogs. B. dermatitidis cells were treated with the 400-2 antibody to (1→3)-β-glucans radiolabeled with the beta-emitter 177Lutetium (177Lu) and alpha-emitter 213Bismuth (213Bi) and the efficacy of cell kill was determined by colony forming units (CFUs). To determine the antigen-specific localization of the 400-2 antibody in vivo, C57BL6 mice were infected intratracheally with 2 × 105 B. dermatitidis cells and given 111In-400-2 antibody 24 h later. To evaluate the killing of B. dermatitidis cells with RIT, intratracheally infected mice were treated with 150 μCi 213Bi-400-2 and their lungs analyzed for CFUs 96 h post-infection. 213Bi-400-2 proved to be more effective in killing B. dermatitidis cells in vitro than 177Lu-400-2. Three times more 111In-400-2 accumulated in the lungs of infected mice, than in the non-infected ones. 213Bi-400-2 lowered the fungal burden in the lungs of infected mice more than 2 logs in comparison with non-treated infected controls. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the ability of an anti-(1-3)-beta-D-glucan antibody armed with an alpha-emitter 213Bi to selectively kill B. dermatitidis cells in vitro and in vivo. These first in vivo results of the effectiveness of RIT targeting pan-antigens on fungal pathogens warrant further investigation."

      "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that naturally occurring substances found in the food of the daily human diet are important for preventing chronic non-communicable diseases. One of them is beta-glucan, which is a natural polysaccharide, occurring in plant cell walls, mainly oats, barley and wheat. It is also present in baker’s yeast cells, fungal cell walls, and some microorganisms. Beta-glucan belongs to one of the dietary fiber fractions, which are attributed a number of beneficial health properties, including the prevention and treatment of certain digestive diseases and supporting the immune system. This compound has biological activity that depends on the size, molecular weight, conformation, frequency of bonds, solubility and changes in structure. Beta-glucan reduces cholesterol and glucose concentrations in the blood, which reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. In addition to its effects on lipid levels and glucose metabolism, beta-glucan also exhibits antioxidant properties by scavenging reactive oxygen species, thereby reducing the risk of diseases, including atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and cancer. Immunostimulatory and antitumor effects have also been reported. The immunostimulatory activity of beta-glucan occurs as a result of its attachment to specific receptors present on the immune cell surface. Beta-glucan belongs to the group of prebiotics which stimulate the growth and activity of the desired natural intestinal microbiota, while inhibiting the growth of pathogens. It plays an important role in the proper functioning of the gastrointestinal tract and preventing inflammation as well as colon cancer. Such a number of health benefits resulting from the properties of beta-glucan may play a key role in improving health and preventing chronic non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer.",

The aim of this study was to characterize the effect of β-glucans extracted from the bread yeast cell wall on loperamide-induced constipation mice. Forty mice were fed with loperamide (10 mg/kg) to make the constipation model and a diet supplemented with 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg β-glucan. We assessed the defecation frequency, intestinal transit function of mice, as well as used high-throughput sequencing to analyze the intestinal microbiota composition and functional biological profiles data. Meanwhile, we detected expression of neurotransmitters including acetylcholinesterase, substance P, and serotonin (5-HT) and expression of tight junction protein (TJP) including zonula occludens-1 and mucin-2 in distal colon to characterize the possible molecular mechanisms. β-glucans significantly enhanced intestinal motility and provided a possibility to regulate the expression of neurotransmitters and TJP in mice. The intestinal microecological portion of the treatment group partially recovered and was closer to the normal group. This study showed that β-glucans can influence the intestinal microbiota and restore microecological balance to regulate the express of neurotransmitters and TJP to recover intestinal epithelial mechanical barrier. We suggested that β-glucans could be used as an active nutritional supplement to protect the damaged intestinal barrier and help patients who have constipation complications and dysbiosis.",

ZX09 with high (2000 kDa) and low (300 kDa) molecular weight (MW) to compare their effects on growth performance and gut function in LPS-induced weaned piglets. Changes in jejunal morphology, mucosal barrier function, microbial populations, and fermentation in the piglets were determined. Data showed that β-glucan prevented body weight loss in LPS challenged piglets. Supplementation with both β-glucan fractions improved jejunal morphology. Compared to low MW, β-glucan of high MW generally up-regulated transcripts of ZO-1, MUC1, and MUC2 in jejunal mucosa to a lesser extent. Mucosal D-lactate, diamine oxidase, and anti-oxidation index were effectively resumed in β-glucan treatment. Both β-glucan diets provoked the emergence of a balanced microbiota and a richer concentration of volatile fatty acids in the colon. The richest community of bifidobacterium and concentration of butyrate emerged after feeding β-glucan with high MW. Results suggested that the effect of Agrobacterium sp. ZX09 β-glucans on the gut-modulatory function is largely linked to their MW. Low MW β-glucan mainly improved the mucosal barrier function in the jejunum, while high MW β-glucan had profound effects on the microbial community and fermentation in the hindgut of piglets."

Considering that DON has strong oxidizing effect and stimulates autophagy and apoptosis, we examined the effects of BYCW on consequent oxidative stress damage indicators, cells autophagy and apoptosis induced by DON using the porcine jejunum epithelial cell lines (IPEC-J2) as a cell culture model. The results showed that application of BYCW could reverse the decrease of cell viability by DON significantly, and suppress the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-8 and -6 (IL-8 and IL-6), except IL-1β. Further experiments revealed that BYCW treatment counteracted the DON-induced down-regulation of intracellular glutathione (GSH) and up-regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Through western blot analysis, we observed that BYCW treatment was able to down-regulate the expression of autophagy protein LC3-II and up-regulate the expression of P62 protein against DON, which suggested that autophagy induced by DON may be suppressed. Altogether, these results indicated a potential ability of supplementation of BYCW to improve cell growth and metabolism as well as the preventive properties of BYCW against the DON-induced cell damage by activating antioxidant system.",

      "abstract": "One bottleneck to sustainability of fish aquaculture is the control of infectious diseases. Current trends include the preventive application of immunostimulants and prebiotics such as polysaccharides. The present study investigated how yeast β-glucan (Y), microalgal polysaccharide-enriched extracts (MAe) and whole Phaeodactylum tricornutum cells (MA) modulated the gut microbiome and stimulated the immune system in Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) when administered by oral intubation. Blood, intestine and spleen samples were taken at 3 h, 24 h, 48 h and 7 days after treatment. The short-term response (within 48 h after treatment) consisted of up-regulation of il1b and irf7 expression in the gut of the Y treated group. In contrast, administration of MAe decreased expression of tnfa and the chemokine cxc10 in the gut and spleen. Both treatments down-regulated the expression of irf3 with respect to the control group. Lysozyme activity in plasma decreased at 48 h only in the MAe-treated soles. Medium-term response consisted of the up-regulation of clec and irf7 expression in the gut of the Y, MAe and MA groups and of il1b mRNAs in the spleen of the MA group compared to the control group. Microbiome analysis using 16S rDNA gene sequencing indicated that the intestine microbiome was dominated by bacteria of the Vibrio genus (>95%). All the treatments decreased the relative proportion of Vibrio in the microbiome and Y and MAe decreased and MA increased diversity. Quantitative PCR confirmed the load of bacteria of the Vibrio genus was significantly decreased and this was most pronounced in Y treated fish. These data indicate that orally administrated insoluble yeast β-glucans acted locally in the gut modulating the immune response and controlling the Vibrio abundance. In contrast, the MAe slightly reduced the Vibrio load in the intestine and caused a transient systemic anti-inflammatory response. The results indicate that these polysaccharides are a promising source of prebiotics for the sole aquaculture industry.",

      "abstract": "β-glucans are cereal-derived soluble fiber compounds that elicit health benefits when consumed in amounts of 0.75 g/serving. The use of β-glucans in whole muscle meat products, such as chicken breast, is unexplored and needs clarification at a discovery level. The objective of this study was to evaluate the incorporation of β-glucan in the whole muscle chicken breast and identify changes in physical, chemical, textural, microbiological, and thermal properties during 9 D of aerobic storage at refrigeration temperatures. Treatments were 1) control (no salt or β-glucan added; CON), 2) salt solution (2% NaCl and 0.2% phosphate curing solution; SALT), 3) β-glucan solution (1.5% β-glucan; βG), and 4) combination of salt and β-glucan solutions (2% NaCl, 0.2% phosphate, and 1.5% β-glucan; SALT+βG). The target injection level was 20%, however the average uptake level was 8.15%. Color, pH, shear force, and bacteria count were minimally affected by treatment during the 9 D of aerobic storage at 4°C. Cooking loss (P < 0.01) was greater in CON samples compared to all other treatments indicating the presence of salt or fiber or both improved water retention. The β-glucan concentration in uncooked chicken following injection was 0.125 g/100 g product and 0.133 g/100g product in βG and SALT+βG treatments, respectively. Following cooking, the β-glucan concentration was 0.010 g/100g product and 0.004 g/100g product in βG and SALT+βG treatments, respectively. There was no storage day effect (P = 0.42) for the β-glucan concentration in cooked product, therefore it was assumed that during cooking, β-glucan concentration in whole muscle injected products was lost. Finally, thermal behavior measured with a differential scanning calorimeter indicated that there were only minimal differences, although some significant, among treatments in this study. Overall, the application of β-glucan injection in whole chicken breast was not detrimental to product quality and actually improved water retention levels. However, new methods need to be developed for the incorporation of β-glucan in injected whole muscle meat product so that β-glucan can be retained during and after cooking.",

      "abstract": "Wholegrain oats are known to modulate the human gut microbiota and have prebiotic properties (increase the growth of some health-promoting bacterial genera within the colon). Research to date mainly attributes these effects to the fibre content; however, oat is also a rich dietary source of polyphenols, which may contribute to the positive modulation of gut microbiota. In vitro anaerobic batch-culture experiments were performed over 24 h to evaluate the impact of two different doses (1 and 3 % (w/v)) of oat bran, matched concentrations of β-glucan extract or polyphenol mix, on the human faecal microbiota composition using 16S RNA gene sequencing and SCFA analysis. Supplementation with oats increased the abundance of Proteobacteria (P &lt;0·01) at 10 h, Bacteroidetes (P &lt;0·05) at 24 h and concentrations of acetic and propionic acid increased at 10 and 24 h compared with the NC. Fermentation of the 1 % (w/v) oat bran resulted in significant increase in SCFA production at 24 h (86 (sd 27) v. 28 (sd 5) mm; P &lt;0·05) and a bifidogenic effect, increasing the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium unassigned at 10 h and Bifidobacterium adolescentis (P &lt;0·05) at 10 and 24 h compared with NC. Considering the β-glucan treatment induced an increase in the phylum Bacteroidetes at 24 h, it explains the Bacteriodetes effects of oats as a food matrix. The polyphenol mix induced an increase in Enterobacteriaceae family at 24 h. In conclusion, in this study, we found that oats increased bifidobacteria, acetic acid and propionic acid, and this is mediated by the synergy of all oat compounds within the complex food matrix, rather than its main bioactive β-glucan or polyphenols. Thus, oats as a whole food led to the greatest impact on the microbiota.",

To evaluate the immunomodulatory activity of orally administered β-glucans, a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical study was performed in asymptomatic children, aged 3 to 5 years old, from Medellin, Colombia. Primary outcomes were the circulating CD8+ T lymphocyte and natural killer cell counts; secondary outcomes were circulating lymphocyte counts (total, CD3+, and CD4+ T cells), serum concentrations of total immunoglobulin A and cytokines, and various hematological parameters. The treatments were administered daily for 12 weeks, and physical and laboratory evaluations were performed at days 0 and 84. Children in the group receiving a yogurt with β-glucans presented a significantly higher absolute count of peripheral blood total lymphocytes (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells) than that in the group receiving placebo. The interventions were safe and well tolerated; no abnormal increases in serum creatinine or hepatic aminotransferases occurred, and adherence was higher than 90% in the intervention groups. This study demonstrates that β-glucans from G. lucidum increase the frequency of immune system cells in the peripheral blood; these cells are critical in the defense against infectious threats in asymptomatic children 3 to 5 years old. These findings warrant longer controlled clinical trials that aim to evaluate the efficacy of β-glucans in preventing infections in healthy children and to define their potential to enhance lymphoid cell number and functions in various lymphoid immune deficiencies.",

Unfortunately, only a limited fraction of patients shows durable responses, which is considered to be due to a T cell-suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Here we argue that naturally occurring β-glucans can enable reversion of such T cell suppression by engaging innate immune cells and enhancing numbers and function of lymphocyte effectors. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes timely reports with respect to absorption, trafficking and immune stimulatory effects of β-glucans, particularly in relation to innate immune cells. Furthermore, we list effects toward well-being and immune functions in healthy subjects as well as cancer patients treated with orally administered β-glucans, extended with effects of β-glucan treatments in mouse cancer models. EXPERT OPINION: Beta-glucans, when present in food and following uptake in the proximal gut, stimulate immune cells present in gut-associated lymphoid tissue and initiate highly conserved pro-inflammatory pathways. When tested in mouse cancer models, β-glucans result in better control of tumor growth and shift the TME toward a T cell-sensitive environment. Along these lines, we advocate that intake of β-glucans provides an accessible and immune-potentiating adjuvant when combined with adoptive T-cell treatments of cancer.",

An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of technical feed ingredients between 14 and 28 d of age on performance and health status of broilers (d 14-35) fed diets with a high inclusion rate of rapeseed meal as a nutritional challenge. It was hypothesized that the feed ingredients would improve health status related parameters. 2. A total of 1008 one-day-old male Ross 308 chicks were distributed over 36 floor pens and allocated to one of six iso-caloric (AMEN 13 MJ/kg) growing diets (d 15-28): a control and five test diets supplemented with quercetin (400 mg/kg), oat hulls (50 g/kg), β-glucan (100 mg/kg), lysozyme (40 mg/kg) or fish oil ω-3 fatty acids (40 g/kg), with six replicate pens per treatment. 3. Dietary inclusion of oat hulls and lysozyme resulted in a reduction in broiler performance during the first week after providing the experimental diets. 4. No effect of interventions on the microbiota diversity in the jejunum and ileum was observed. Ileal microbiota composition of birds fed oat hulls differed from the other groups, as shown by a higher abundance of the genus Enterococcus, mainly at the expense of the genus Lactobacillus. 5. In the jejunum, villus height and crypt depth of lysozyme-fed birds at d 28 were decreased compared to the control group. Higher total surface area of villi occupied by goblet cells and total villi surface area in jejunum (d 21 and 28) were observed in chickens fed oat hulls compared to other groups. 6. Genes related to the growth-factor-activity pathway were more highly expressed in birds fed β-glucan compared to the control group, while the genes related to anion-transmembrane-transporter-activity pathway in the quercetin- and oat hull-fed birds were less expressed.

This study evaluated the feeding effects of β-glucans on performance and responses of chickens during a coccidiosis challenge. Cobb 500 male broilers (n = 1280) were assigned to 1 of 8 treatment groups (8 replicate pens; 20 birds/pen) in a 2 × 4 factorial arrangement, including non-infected and Eimeria-infected birds fed for 28 d a control diet, control + BG (150 g/MT Algamune 50), control + BGZn (100 g/MT Algamune 50 Zn), and control + 0.01% Salinomycin (Sal). On d15, birds in the challenge groups received a mixed Eimeria inoculum. Birds and feed were weighed weekly on a per pen basis to evaluate body weight gain (BWG), feed intake (FI), and feed conversion ratios (FCR). Lesion scores were assessed 6 d post infection (d21) on 3 birds per pen. Performance data were subjected to ANOVA and differences were established using the LS-MEANS statement with significance reported at P ≤ 0.05. There were minor differences in lesion scores among the dietary treatments in the infected groups with reduced duodenal and cecal scores in the Sal group compared to the BGZn and BG groups, respectively. The coccidiosis challenge main effect resulted in a significant reduction in 0-28 d BW and FI. Dietary treatment resulted in non-significant effect on BWG, but Sal addition resulted in increased FI. A significant diet X challenge interaction resulted in higher FCR in the Eimeria-challenged birds supplemented with Sal and BGZn in comparison to the other challenged groups, likely due to reduced mortality in the challenged Sal and BGZn groups. Body composition analysis at d28 revealed that the Eimeria challenge reduced both fat and lean tissue contents, where the β-glucans and Sal birds had lower fat percent than control birds.",

We investigated how molecular mass and oligomer structure important for BG food and health properties affected plasma lipids and gut parameters in hypercholesterolemic rats. Following 3 weeks on a high-cholestrol diet, rats were given a high-cholesterol diet supplemented with either cellulose (control) or purified barley BGs with low (100 or 150 kDa; glucagel or lowBG, respectively) or medium (530 kDa; mediumBG) molecular masses varying in cellotriosyl/cellotetraosyl oligomer ratio for 4 weeks. All four diets (control, glucagel, lowBG or mediumBG) reduced plasma triacylglycerol and cholesterols from week 3 to 7. The BG diets increased cecal production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) compared to the control diet. The glucagel and lowBG diets stimulated the number of Bifidobacterium in the cecum, whereas the mediumBG diet reduced numbers of both Bacteroides/Prevotella and Lactobacillus in the cecum compared to the control diet. In conclusion, barley BGs at 6.5-7.5% of the diet independent of molecular mass and oligomer block structure showed no additional effect compared to the control treatment on blood cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels in this hypercholesterolemic rat model. Furthermore, the cecal fermentation pattern and microbial composition did not seem to affect plasma lipid composition.",

From physiological limitation of bacterial preservation in storage and safety, the live E. faecalis 2001 has been heat-treated and the BRM components containing high level of β-glucan, named EF-2001, were prepared. METHOD: The heat-treated EF-2001 has been examined for the antioxidative potential for radical scavenging and anti-tumor activities as well as immune-enhancing response in mice. Lymphocyte versus polymorphonuclear leukocyte ratio was increased in mice upon treatment with EF-2001. The number of lymphocytes was increased in the EF-2001-treated group. In the mice bearing two different Ehrlich solid and Sarcoma-180 carcinomas, the treatment with EF-2001 resulted in anti-tumor action. Tumor-suppressive capacity upon treatment with EF-2001 was significantly increased compared to normal controls. RESULTS: During the time interval administration of 5 weeks between the priming and secondary administration of EF-2001, the expression and production levels of TNF-α were also observed in the EF- 2001-administered mice. Additionally, anti-tumor activity examined with the intravenous administration of EF 2001 with a 34 times interval was also observed, as the growth of Sarcoma180 cells was clearly inhibited by the EF-2001. CONCLUSION: From the results, it was suggested that the immune response is enhanced due to antioxidative activity caused by the EF-2001 and anti-tumor activity by NK cells and TNF-α.",

We analyzed the metabolic effects of a specifically designed 'functional' bread, low in starch, rich in fibers (7 g/100 g), with a beta glucan/starch ratio of (7.6:100, g/g), in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods: Clinical and metabolic data from two groups of age-, sex- and glycated hemoglobin-matched diabetic subjects, taking either the functional bread or regular white bread, over a roughly six-month observation period, were retrieved. RESULTS: Bread intake did not change during the trial. The functional bread reduced glycated hemoglobin by ~0.5% (absolute units) vs. pre-treatment values (p = 0.028), and by ~0.6% vs. the control group (p = 0.027). Post-prandial and mean plasma glucose was decreased in the treatment group too. Body weight, blood pressure and plasma lipids did not change. The acceptance of the functional bread was good in the majority of subjects, except for taste. CONCLUSIONS: A starch-restricted, fiber-rich functional bread, with an increased beta glucan/starch ratio, improved long term metabolic control, and may be indicated in the dietary treatment of type 2 diabetes.",

The periodontopathogen was applied and allowed to cross the top layer of cells (OBA-9) to reach the bottom layer of cells (HGF-1) and induce the synthesis of immune factors and cytokines in the host cells. β-glucan (10 μg/mL or 20 μg/mL) were added, and the transcriptional factors and metabolites produced were quantified in the remaining cell layers and supernatant. RESULTS: The relative expression of interleukin (IL)-1-α and IL-18 genes in HGF-1 decreased with 10 μg/mL or 20 μg/mL of β-glucan, where as the expression of PTGS-2 decreased only with 10 μg/mL. The expression of IL-1-α increased with 20 μg/mL and that of IL-18 increased with 10 μg/mL in OBA-9; the expression of BCL 2, EP 300, and PTGS-2 decreased with the higher dose of β-glucan. The production of the metabolite 4-aminobutyric acid presented lower concentrations under 20 μg/mL, whereas the concentrations of 2-deoxytetronic acid NIST and oxalic acid decreased at both concentrations used. Acetophenone, benzoic acid, and pinitol presented reduced concentrations only when treated with 10 μg/mL of β-glucan.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oat and barley beta-glucans are prebiotic fibers known for their cholesterol-lowering activity, but their action on the human gut microbiota metabolism is still under research. Although the induction of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) following their ingestion has previously been reported, no study has investigated their effects on proteolytic uremic toxins p-cresyl sulfate (pCS) and indoxyl sulfate (IS) levels, while others have failed to demonstrate an effect on the endothelial function measured through flow-mediated dilation (FMD). OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to evaluate whether a nutritional intervention with a functional pasta enriched with beta-glucans could promote a saccharolytic shift on the gut microbial metabolism and improve FMD. METHODS: We carried out a pilot study on 26 healthy volunteers who underwent a 2-month dietary treatment including a daily administration of Granoro \"Cuore Mio\" pasta enriched with barley beta-glucans (3g/100g). Blood and urine routine parameters, serum pCS/IS and FMD were evaluated before and after the dietary treatment. RESULTS: The nutritional treatment significantly reduced LDL and total cholesterol, as expected. Moreover, following beta-glucans supplementation we observed a reduction of serum pCS levels and an increase of FMD, while IS serum levels remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that a beta-glucans dietary intervention in healthy volunteers correlates with a saccharolytic shift on the gut microbiota metabolism, as suggested by the decrease of pCS and the increase of SCFA, and associates with an improved endothelial reactivity. Our pilot study suggests, in addition to cholesterol, novel pCS-lowering properties of beta-glucans, worthy to be confirmed in large-scale trials and particularly in contexts where the reduction of the microbial-derived uremic toxin pCS is of critical importance, such as in chronic kidney disease.",

For 3 species, including Pneumocystis jirovecii, which causes Pneumocystis pneumonia in humans, Pneumocystis carinii, and Pneumocystis murina, β-1,3-glucans were masked in most organisms, as demonstrated by increased exposure following trypsin treatment. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and microarray techniques, we demonstrated in a mouse model of Pneumocystis pneumonia that treatment with caspofungin, an inhibitor of β-1,3-glucan synthesis, for 21 days decreased expression of a broad panel of inflammatory markers, including interferon γ, tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 1β, interleukin 6, and multiple chemokines/chemokine ligands. Thus, β-glucans in Pneumocystis cysts are largely masked, which likely decreases innate immune activation; this mechanism presumably was developed for interactions with immunocompetent hosts, in whom organism loads are substantially lower. In immunosuppressed hosts with a high organism burden, organism death and release of glucans appears to be an important contributor to deleterious host inflammatory responses.",

Oral administration of β-glucans affects tumour growth, microbial infection, sepsis, and wound healing. We hypothesized that pre-treatment with orally delivered soluble and particulate β-glucans could ameliorate the development of aggravate dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced intestinal inflammation. To study this, mice were orally pre-treated with β-glucans for 14 days. We tested curdlan (a particulate β-(1,3)-glucan), glucan phosphate (a soluble β-(1,3)-glucan), and zymosan (a particle made from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which contains around 55% β-glucans). Weight loss, colon weight, and feces score did not differ between β-glucan and vehicle treated groups. However, histology scores indicated that β-glucan-treated mice had increased inflammation at a microscopic level suggesting that β-glucan treatment worsened intestinal inflammation. Furthermore, curdlan and zymosan treatment led to increased colonic levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, compared to vehicle. Glucan phosphate treatment did not significantly affect cytokine and chemokine levels. These data suggest that particulate and soluble β-glucans differentially affect the intestinal immune responses. However, no significant differences in other clinical colitis scores between soluble and particulate β-glucans were found in this study. In summary, β-glucans aggravate the course of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced intestinal inflammation at the level of the mucosa.",

On the 14th day of this period, periodontal disease was induced using a ligature protocol. β-glucans reduced the amount of alveolar bone loss in animals with periodontal disease in both the diabetic and non-diabetic groups (p < 0.05). β-glucans reduced blood glucose, cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels in diabetic animals, both with and without periodontal disease (p < 0.05). Furthermore, treatment with β-glucans reduced the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand and increased osteoprotegerin expression in animals with diabetes and periodontal disease (p < 0.05).

The underlying molecular mechanisms involved in decreasing tumor formation, however, are not well understood. In this study, we examined the antiproliferative role and mechanism of action of three different fungal exocellular β-glucans in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The β-glucans were obtained from Botryosphaeria rhodina MAMB-05 [two botryosphaerans; (1→3)(1→6)-β-d-glucan; one produced on glucose, the other on fructose] and Lasiodiplodia theobromae MMPI [lasiodiplodan; (1→6)-β-d-glucan, produced on glucose]. Using the cell proliferation-MTT assay, we showed that the β-glucans exhibited a time- and concentration-dependent antiproliferative activity (IC50, 100μg/ml). Markers of cell cycle, apoptosis, necrosis and oxidative stress were analyzed using flow cytometry, RT-PCR and Western blotting. Exposure to β-glucans increased apoptosis, necrosis, oxidative stress, mRNA expression of p53, p27 and Bax; the activity of AMP-activated protein-kinase, Forkhead transcription factor FOXO3a, Bax and caspase-3; and decreased the activity of p70S6K in MCF-7 cells. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, the fungal β-glucans increased oxidative stress, which was associated with reduced cell viability. We showed that these β-glucans exhibited an antiproliferative effect that was associated with apoptosis, necrosis and oxidative stress. This study demonstrated for the first time that the apoptosis induced by β-glucans was mediated by AMP-activated protein-kinase and Forkhead transcription factor, FOXO3a. Our findings provide novel mechanistic insights into their antiproliferative roles, and compelling evidence that these β-glucans possess a broad range of biomodulatory properties that may prove useful in cancer treatment.",

METHODS: The experiment was carried out on 72 8-week old male Sprague-Dawley rats: control (n = 36) and experimental (n = 36). In half of the animals from each group enteritis was induced by LPS (10 mg kg(-1)). Rats from the experimental group were divided into two groups receiving high (GI) or low (GII) molecular weight beta-glucans for 6 consecutive weeks. RESULTS: LPS evoked enteritis in all the treated animals, manifested by changes in the levels of IL-10, IL-12 and TNF-alpha, as well as in the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs) in the colon tissue. Dietary supplementation with beta-glucans following LPS treatment partially reversed this effect. The changes in SCFA concentration were noted, indicating an improvement of the fermentation process in the colon. This effect coincided with an increased number of LAB, pointing at the prebiotic properties of beta-glucans. The positive influence of beta-glucans was also manifested by the improved values of antioxidative potential markers (TAS, SOD, GR and GPx activity, TBARS concentration), noted especially in rats with LPS-induced enteritis. This influence was more pronounced in the case of low molecular weight oat beta-glucan (GII). CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed a positive effect of beta-glucans, especially the low molecular weight form, on the colon tissue of healthy rats, as well as animals with LPS-induced enteritis.",

      "abstract": "β-Glucans are known to exhibit hypocholesterolemic effects. Increased intestinal viscosity is thought to be crucial for cholesterol lowering. It is suggested that concentration, molecular mass, and structure, including the ratio of (1→3) to (1→4) glucan bonds in the molecule, are of importance for β-glucan functionality. This study investigated the effects of 3 different β-glucan sources, incorporated into a beverage and yogurt, on blood lipids and fecal endpoints. Fourteen participants completed this randomized, crossover, single-blinded study with four 3-wk periods: control and 3.3 g/d oat, barley, and barley mutant β-glucans of similar molecular mass. Before and after each period, fasting and postprandial blood samples were drawn and 3-d fecal samples were collected. Treatment did not affect changes in total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol compared with control; however, consumption of 3.3 g/d of oat β-glucans for 3 wk resulted in greater decreases in total (-0.29 ± 0.09 mmol/L, P < 0.01), LDL (-0.23 ± 0.07 mmol/L, P < 0.01), and HDL (-0.05 ± 0.03 mmol/L, P < 0.05) cholesterol compared with baseline. Changes in LDL in the β-glucan treatments were not related to β-glucan structure (cellotriosyl:cellotetraosyl). Decreases in fasting triacylglycerol were substantially greater after oat β-glucan treatment compared with control (P = 0.03). Fecal dry and wet weight, stool frequency, fecal pH, and energy excretion were unaffected. The results do not fully support the hypocholesterolemic effects by differently structured oat and barley β-glucans. However, substantial differences compared with baseline suggest a potential for oat β-glucan, presumably due to its higher solubility and viscosity. This underlines the importance of elusive structural β-glucan features for beneficial physiologic effects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: β-glucans are fungal cell wall components that bind to the C-type lectin-like receptor dectin-1. Polymorphisms of dectin-1 gene are associated with susceptibility to invasive fungal infection and medically refractory ulcerative colitis. The purpose of this study has been addressing the response of human macrophages to β-glucans under different conditions mimicking the composition of the inflammatory milieu in view of the wide plasticity and large range of phenotypical changes showed by these cells, and the relevant role of dectin-1 in several pathophysiological conditions. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Serum-differentiated macrophages stimulated with β-glucans showed a low production of TNFα and IL-1β, a high production of IL-6 and IL-23, and a delayed induction of cyclooxygenase-2 and PGE2 biosynthesis that resembled the responses elicited by crystals and those produced when phagosomal degradation of the phagocytic cargo increases ligand access to intracellular pattern recognition receptors. Priming with a low concentration of LPS produced a rapid induction of cyclooxygenase-2 and a synergistic release of PGE2. When the differentiation of the macrophages was carried out in the presence of M-CSF, an increased expression of dectin-1 B isoform was observed. In addition, this treatment made the cells capable to release arachidonic acid in response to β-glucan. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the macrophage response to fungal β-glucans is strongly influenced by cytokines and microbial-derived factors that are usual components of the inflammatory milieu. These responses can be sorted into three main patterns i) an elementary response dependent on phagosomal processing of pathogen-associated molecular patterns and/or receptor-independent, direct membrane binding linked to the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-bearing transmembrane adaptor DNAX-activating protein 12, ii) a response primed by TLR4-dependent signals, and iii) a response dependent on M-CSF and dectin-1 B isoform expression that mainly signals through the dectin-1 B/spleen tyrosine kinase/cytosolic phospholipase A2 route.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Plant pathogens secrete enzymes that degrade plant cell walls to enhance infection and nutrient acquisition. RESULTS: A novel endotransglucosylase catalyzes cleavage and transfer of β-glucans and decreases the physical strength of plant cell walls. CONCLUSION: Endotransglucosylation causes depolymerization and polymerization of β-glucans, depending on substrate molecular size. SIGNIFICANCE: Enzymatic degradation of plant cell walls is required for wall loosening, which enhances pathogen invasion. A Magnaporthe oryzae enzyme, which was encoded by the Mocel7B gene, was predicted to act on 1,3-1,4-β-glucan degradation and transglycosylation reaction of cellotriose after partial purification from a culture filtrate of M. oryzae cells, followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A recombinant MoCel7B prepared by overexpression in M. oryzae exhibited endo-typical depolymerization of polysaccharides containing β-1,4-linkages, in which 1,3-1,4-β-glucan was the best substrate. When cellooligosaccharides were used as the substrate, the recombinant enzyme generated reaction products with both shorter and longer chain lengths than the substrate. In addition, incorporation of glucose and various oligosaccharides including sulforhodamine-conjugated cellobiose, laminarioligosaccharides, gentiobiose, xylobiose, mannobiose, and xyloglucan nonasaccharide into β-1,4-linked glucans were observed after incubation with the enzyme. These results indicate that the recombinant enzyme acts as an endotransglucosylase (ETG) that cleaves the glycosidic bond of β-1,4-glucan as a donor substrate and transfers the cleaved glucan chain to another molecule functioning as an acceptor substrate. Furthermore, ETG treatment caused greater extension of heat-treated wheat coleoptiles. The result suggests that ETG functions to induce wall loosening by cleaving the 1,3-1,4-β-glucan tethers of plant cell walls. On the other hand, use of cellohexaose as a substrate for ETG resulted in the production of cellulose II with a maximum length (degree of polymerization) of 26 glucose units. Thus, ETG functions to depolymerize and polymerize β-glucans, depending on the size of the acceptor substrate.",

The immune-stimulating effect of beta-glucans has been well studied, and several beta-glucan receptors have been identified on the surface of immune cells. In addition, mushroom extracts with high levels of beta-glucans have also been shown to have direct cytotoxic effects on cancer cells, and beta-glucans are used for the treatment of cancer.

Evidence has supported the idea that beta-glucans can decrease the size of xenografted colon cancer tumors via the stimulation of the immune system and direct cytotoxicity. Beta-glucans can also have synergistic effects with chemotherapeutic agents and other immune stimulators, and an innovative strategy is to use beta-glucans to deliver nanoparticles containing chemotherapeutic agents to the site of the colon cancer and, thus, improve the therapeutic efficacy.",

Their efficacy has been confirmed in the therapeutic treatment and prevention of various infectious diseases, secondary immune defects and also of oncologic disorders. Allergic diseases are one of the most frequent diseases and their prevalence continues to increase. They develop as a consequence of dysregulation of the immune system, especially when there is failure in the equilibrium of the response of TH1/TH2 lymphocytes towards TH2. New therapeutic approaches in the treatment of immunopathological conditions (e.g. allergic or oncologic) are directed to restoring the equilibrium among different T lymphocyte subpopulations. Based on in vitro experiments, and also on animal and human clinical studies, there is much evidence for the importance of β-glucans in the treatment and also prevention of allergic diseases; this opens new perspectives on the use of this widespread and popular group of natural substances.",

      "abstract": "β-glucans belong to a group of polysaccharides located in the cell wall of bacteria, fungi including mushrooms, as well as cereals such as barley and oats. All β-glucans are glucose polymers linked together by a (β 1-3) linear β-glycosidic chain core and they differ by their length and branching structures. They are considered biological response modifiers with immunomodulatory and health beneficial effects including anticancer properties. Few studies using purified β- glucans were performed, but their anticancer potential was demonstrated mainly through studies using extracts from mushrooms, yeast or other sources which contain β-glucan as a key component. Their anticancer effects were demonstrated mainly in in vitro and in vivo experimental systems but fewer studies from human populations are available. β-glucans have been used as adjuvant therapy in clinical trials, mainly in the Far East, with a positive effect on patients'survival and quality of life. The mechanism of action is suggested to be through its stimulation of the immune system. This review focuses on human studies; clinical trials and epidemiological data assessing the efficacy and safety of mushroom-derived β- glucans in cancer treatment and prevention. The potential direct effects of β-glucans on cancer cells are also described.",

Since Pillemer et al. first prepared and investigated zymosan in the 1940s and others followed with the investigation of β-glucans in the 1960s and 1970s, researchers have well established the significant role of β-glucans on the immune system relative to cancer treatment, infection immunity, and restoration of damaged bone marrow. However, information on their biological role in anti-metastatic activity remains limited. As an immunomodulating agent, β-glucan acts through the activation of innate immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, granulocytes, and natural killer cells. This activation triggers the responses of adaptive immune cells such as CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells and B cells, resulting in the inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis. Reports have shown that β-glucans exert multiple effects on cancer cells and cancer prevention. However the mechanisms of their actions appear complex due to differences in source, chemical structure, insufficiently defined preparation, and molecular weight, hence the inconsistent and often contradictory results obtained. This review is focused on the potential of β-glucans as anti-metastatic agents and the known mechanisms underlying their biological effects.",

      "abstract": "β-Glucans are polysaccharides of β-D-glucose extracted from the cell walls of different species of mushrooms, yeast, oat, barley, seaweeds, algae and bacteria. Modern biomedical research has identified β-glucans as biological response modifiers (BRM) with anti-tumor properties that elicit potent immune responses through their recognition by a variety of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages and neutrophils. Complement receptor-3 (CR3), lactosylceramides, scavenger receptors and dectin-1 are involved in β-glucan recognition, triggering a series of signaling events that modulate innate and subsequently adaptive immune responses. β-Glucan binding to specific receptors in DCs and macrophages triggers their activation and maturation, increases their antigen-presentation ability and enhances the production of proinflammatory cytokines that stimulate the polarization of TH1 or TH17 responses, and induces the activation of antigen-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Moreover, large β-glucans can be degraded by macrophages into smaller moieties, when released, prime CR3 receptor on neutrophils and natural killer (NK) cells mediating CR3-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (CR3-DCC) of iC3b opsonized tumor cells. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of β- glucan-induced signaling in immune cells is essential for the design of new therapeutic strategies against cancer. Future studies should be done to translate β-glucan research to the clinic.",

      "abstract": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have greatly advanced the field of anti-cancer immunotherapy and have made a major impact in clinical medicine. While more mAbs have been approved by the FDA and entered into the clinical therapeutic arena with indications to treat various solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, extensive efforts have also been made to make mAb therapy more effective. Combination therapy of anti-tumor mAbs with chemotherapeutic drugs has been widely used in the clinical patient care. In addition, many immune stimulating agents have been specifically studied for this very purpose. One compound in particular, β-glucan, has shown very promising and exciting results in pre-clinical animal models and early phase human clinical trials. β-Glucans are naturally occurring, abundant polysaccharides with different structures that can be extracted and purified from fungi, bacteria, oats and barley. The active components of yeast-derived β-glucan exert their unique immune stimulating functions by binding specifically to complement receptor 3 (CR3) via lectin-like domain (LLD) and activating CR3 to promote cellular cytotoxicity of iC3b-coated cancer cells. In addition, particulate yeast-derived β-glucan stimulates both innate and adaptive anti-tumor immune responses. This review covers the anti-cancer mechanisms of anti-tumor mAbs and β-glucans, the pre-clinical studies done with β-glucans in conjunction with anti-tumor mAbs in human carcinoma xenograft models, and the preliminary results of human clinical trials with different β-glucans, as well as those of phase I/II and III studies using the combination of yeast-derived soluble β-glucan and anti-tumor mAbs.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The formation of AGEs progressively increases with normal aging, even in the absence of disease (the pathogenesis of diabetes associated vascular disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease). However, they are formed at accelerated rates in age-related diseases. The polysaccharides might play a role in wound healing, both internally and externally, and also that they could play a role against inflammation and may lead to the production of better medicines to be used as supplements in cancer treatment. OBJECTIVES: The acid hydrolysis was studied with H2SO4 at 80% concentration to determine the most effective procedure for total hydrolysis of beta-glucan. The standard of beta-glucans acid hydrolysate were compared for commercial oat and oatmeal, mushrooms: Pleurotus ostreatus, Fungus and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The following materials and reagents were used in the examination: reference beta-(1 --> 3)-(1 --> 6)-glucan, oat and oatmeal, mushrooms: Pleurotus ostreatus, Fungus and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Raman spectra of the sample solutions (beta-glucan acid hydrolysates) were recorded on a MAGNA-IR 860 with FT-Raman accessory. Sample was irradiated with a 1064 nm line of the T10-8S Nd spectra-physics model: YAG laser and scattered radiation were collected at 180 degrees, using 4 cm(-1) resolution. The polysaccharide was hydrolyzed into component monosaccharides with 80% H2SO4 at 0 degrees C for 30 minutes and monosaccharide derivatives were subjected to electrophoresis, as in a ealier authors study, on a strip of cellulose acetate membrane (CA-SYS-MINI Cellulose Acetate Systems) in 0.2 M Ca(OAc)2 (pH 7.5) at 10 mA, max. 240 V for 1.5 h. The strips were stained with 0.5% toluidine blue in 3% HOAc solution and then rinsed in distilled water and air-dried. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A part of the hexoses (for example glucose) are converted, to products such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural. Various coloured substances, through the Maillard reaction have been reported for saccharides. The resulting mono- and oligosaccharides were analysed by cellulose acetate membrane electrophoresis CAE and Raman spectroscopy. Individual bands or CAE spots were selected to monitor the sugar content in medical plant cell walls and to confirm the identity of the analysed sample: oat and oatmeal, mushrooms: Pleurotus ostreatus, Fungus and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The possibility of a taxonomic classification of products rich in cell-wall materials based on cellulose acetate membrane electrophoresis CAE and Raman spectroscopy for authentication and detection of adulteration of products are discussed.",

Commercially purified barley β-glucan (commercial BG) and lentinan were included to compare β-glucans from the same origin but different degree of purity and processing. METHODS AND RESULTS: Chemical composition and molecular weight distribution of β-glucan samples were determined. Inflammation-related gene expression kinetics (IL-1β, IL-8, nuclear factor kappa B [NF-κB] and IL-10) after 3, 6 and 24 h of stimulation with 100 μg/mL β-glucan were investigated. All tested β-glucans mildly upregulated the observed inflammation-related genes with differential gene expression patterns. Similar gene expression kinetics, but different fold induction values, was found for the crude β-glucan extracts and their corresponding commercial forms. Pre-incubation of THP-1 macrophages with β-glucans prior to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure decreased the induction of inflammation-related genes compared to LPS treatment. No production of nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) was detected in β-glucan stimulated THP-1 macrophages. Phagocytic activity was not different after stimulation by β-glucan samples. CONCLUSION: Based on these in vitro analyses, it can be concluded that the analysed β-glucans have varying levels of immunomodulating properties, which are likely related to structure, molecular weight and compositional characteristic of β-glucan.",

      "abstract": "Weaning in young animals is associated with an increased incidence of gastrointestinal infections. β-glucans exert numerous physiological effects, including altering immune function. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of feeding barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)-derived β-glucans on immune and intestinal function in weanling pigs (Sus scrofa). Thirty-one individually-housed Dutch Landrace pigs (21 d; initial BW, 6,298 ± 755 g) were weaned and fed a wheat-based diet (control) or a low (Lo-BG), medium (Med-BG), or high β-glucan-containing barley-based diet (Hi-BG) for 2 wk with 7 or 8 pigs/treatment. Intestinal segments were analyzed for permeability using Ussing chambers and K88 Escherichia coli adhesion to enterocytes was assessed ex vivo. Immune cells from mesenteric lymph nodes, peripheral blood, and Peyer's patches were analyzed for lymphocyte subsets by indirect immunofluorescence and the ability to respond ex vivo to mitogens by (3)H-thymidine incorporation. Hematology and neutrophil function were determined by flow cytometry. Neutrophil burst, size, and granularity, lymphocyte proliferation, and B-cell distribution in peripheral blood lymphocytes, Peyer's patches, and mesenteric lymph nodes were not affected by β-glucans content of the diet. The β-glucans content of the diet altered blood concentrations of erythrocytes and leukocytes, CD4, CD45RA, and CD8 blood cells (P < 0.05). In addition, feeding β-glucan resulted in increased (P < 0.05) percentage CD45RA positive cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes, Peyer's patches, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Mannitol permeability and tissue conductance were increased (P < 0.05) in Hi-BG fed pigs compared with control pigs. Percentage maximum K88-E.coli binding was increased in proportion to the β-glucan content of the diet (P < 0.05). Although β-glucan feeding during the weaning period increased blood lymphocytes and the proportion of naïve T-cells, it also increased E. coli-enterocyte binding and intestinal permeability. β-glucan may alter immune and intestinal function of weaning pigs.",

The first objective of the present study was to compare the effects of purified β-glucans derived from Laminaria digitata, L. hyperborea and Saccharomyces cerevisiae on piglet performance, selected bacterial populations and intestinal volatile fatty acid (VFA) production. The second aim was to compare the gene expression profiles of the markers of pro- and anti-inflammation in both unchallenged and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged ileal and colonic tissues. β-Glucans were included at 250 mg/kg in the diets. The β-glucans derived from L. hyperborea, L. digitata and S. cerevisiae all reduced the Enterobacteriaceae population (P<0·05) without influencing the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria populations (P>0·05) in the ileum and colon. There was a significant interaction between gastrointestinal region and β-glucan source in the expression of cytokine markers, IL-1α (<0·001), IL-10 (P<0·05), TNF-α (P<0·05) and IL-17A (P<0·001). β-Glucans did not stimulate any pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokine markers in the ileal epithelial cells. In contrast, the expression of a panel of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1α, IL-10, TNF-α and IL-17A) was down-regulated in the colon following exposure to β-glucans from all the three sources. However, the data suggest that the soluble β-glucans derived from L. digitata may be acting via a different mechanism from the insoluble β-glucans derived from L. hyperborea and S. cerevisiae, as the VFA profile was different in the L. digitata-treated animals. There was an increase in IL-8 gene expression (P<0·05) in the gastrointestinal tract from the animals exposed to L. digitata following an LPS ex vivo challenge that was not evident in the other two treatment groups. In conclusion, β-glucans from both seaweed and yeast sources reduce Enterobacteriaceae counts and pro-inflammatory markers in the colon, though the mechanisms of action may be different between the soluble and insoluble fibre sources.",

This review summarizes data on the hematopoiesis-stimulating effects of β-glucans, as well as on their ability to enhance bone marrow recovery after an injury. β-glucans have been shown to support murine hematopoiesis suppressed by ionizing radiation or cytotoxic anti-cancer therapy. They also enhance stem cell homing and engraftment. Basically, two forms of β-glucan preparations have been investigated, namely particulate and soluble ones. β-glucans are generally well tolerated, the particulate forms showing a higher incidence of undesirable side effects. Taken together, the hematopoiesis-stimulating properties of β-glucans predetermine these biological response modifiers to ever increasing use in human medicinal practice.",

Here we analyzed the effects of an insoluble whole glucan particle (WGP), a 1,3/1,6-β-glucan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and a soluble poly-1-6-β-d-glucopyranosyl-1-3-β-d-glucopyranose (PGG), a hydrolytic product of WGP, on the anti-microbial response of human macrophages against mycobacterial infection. Treatment of macrophages with WGP and PGG significantly decreased cell association and intracellular growth of Mycobacterium bovis BCG, but not Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) when compared to untreated controls. We characterized the influence of β-glucans on the generation of macrophage oxidative products and pro-inflammatory cytokines, two important anti-microbial defense mechanisms. WGP but not PGG treatment enhanced the oxidative response of macrophages as determined by the 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin (DCF) assay. WGP treatment also induced macrophages to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines. The β-glucan receptor, Dectin-1, was found to be involved in the WGP-induced macrophage oxidative burst and intracellular growth inhibition of M. bovis BCG. This report indicates that although some forms of β-glucan are able to stimulate the respiratory burst and cytokine production in human macrophages, and exhibit anti-microbial properties against M. bovis BCG, the β-glucans tested here did not inhibit growth of M.tb within human macrophages.",

      "abstract": "β-glucans have been reported to function as a potent adjuvant to stimulate innate and adaptive immune responses. However, β-glucans from different sources are differential in their structure, conformation, and thus biologic activity. Different preparations of β-glucans, soluble versus particulate, further complicate their mechanism of action. Here we show that yeast-derived particulate β-glucan activated dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages via a C-type lectin receptor dectin-1 pathway. Activated DCs by particulate β-glucan promoted Th1 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte priming and differentiation in vitro. Treatment of orally administered yeast-derived particulate β-glucan elicited potent antitumor immune responses and drastically down-regulated immunosuppressive cells, leading to the delayed tumor progression. Deficiency of the dectin-1 receptor completely abrogated particulate β-glucan-mediated antitumor effects. In contrast, yeast-derived soluble β-glucan bound to DCs and macrophages independent of the dectin-1 receptor and did not activate DCs. Soluble β-glucan alone had no therapeutic effect but significantly augmented antitumor monoclonal antibody-mediated therapeutic efficacy via a complement activation pathway but independent of dectin-1 receptor. These findings reveal the importance of different preparations of β-glucans in the adjuvant therapy and allow for the rational design of immunotherapeutic protocols usable in clinical trials.",

An experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of dietary β-glucan source and the inclusion of an enzyme composite containing β-glucanase on energy and nutrient digestibility, N utilization, distal gastrointestinal tract (GIT) fermentation, and manure emissions from finisher boars. Twenty-eight boars (BW = 74.2 ± 3.6 kg) were assigned to 1 of 4 dietary treatments (n = 7/treatment): 1) an oat-based diet (oat), 2) an oat diet + enzyme composite (OE), 3) a wheat-based diet + purified β-glucans (WG), and 4) a wheat-based diet + purified β-glucans + enzyme composite. The wheat-based diets containing purified β-glucans were formulated to contain concentrations of total β-glucans comparable with the oat-based diet. Consumption of the WG diet resulted in a greater digestibility of GE (P = 0.001) and an increase in the urine:feces N excretion ratio (P = 0.049) compared with the oat diet. In the distal GIT, pigs offered the WG diet contained fewer bifidobacteria (P = 0.027) and lactobacilli (P = 0.050) compared with the oat diet. Pigs offered the WG diet had increased manure odor emissions compared with the oat diet (P = 0.023). In conclusion, although supplementing wheat-based diets with extracted oat-β-glucan did not reduce nutrient digestibility, there was a negligible effect in beneficially influencing manure emissions from pigs when compared with a conventional oat formulation.",

      "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) combines a drug or photosensitizer with a specific type of light to kill cancer cells. The cellular damage induced by PDT leads to activation of the DNA damage repair, which is an important factor for modulating tumor sensitivity to this treatment. beta-Glucans are natural polysaccharides that bind complement receptor 3 on the effector cells, thereby activating them to kill tumor cells during PDT. The hypothesis of the present study was that adjuvant therapy with beta-glucans would increase the efficacy of PDT. C57BL/6 female mice were subcutaneously implanted with Lewis lung carcinoma cells. Ten days after implantation, the mice were administered intravenously sodium porfimer (10 mg/kg) 24 h prior to laser irradiation, with or without oral administration of beta-glucan (400 microg/d/mouse, 5 days) from either barley, baker's yeast, or marine brown algae that contains the storage glucan, laminarin. Tumor volume and necrotic area in excised tumors were measured. The expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was determined as an indicator of the activity of the DNA damage repair system. PDT in combination with each beta-glucan significantly reduced tumor growth (P < 0.05, n = 10) and expression of PCNA (P < 0.001, n = 9), and increased necrosis in tumor tissues (P < 0.001, n = 9). Furthermore, each structurally different <beta-glucan exerted similar potentiating effects on PDT. The present findings show that beta-glucans enhance the tumor response to PDT, resulting in pronounced necrosis of PDT-treated tumors and suppression of the DNA damage repair system.",

Due to their immunomodulatory properties, purified beta-glucans have been used clinically as part of a combination therapy for a variety of cancers and their potential anti-infective properties have received attention. This review relates the structure of beta-glucans to their function, with a particular focus on their documented immunomodulatory effects and the mechanisms by which they affect inter- and intracellular function, resulting in potential antimicrobial benefits. Overall, the benefits of dietary supplementation with beta-glucans in order to enhance innate resistance to biological agents are evaluated.",

An experiment with a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments was initiated to investigate the effect of dietary source of beta-glucan (barley vs. oats) and enzyme supplementation (no vs. yes) on nutrient digestibility, N utilization, intestinal fermentation, and manure odor and ammonia emissions from finisher boars (n = 4; BW = 73.9 kg; SD = 4.7). Sixteen boars were assigned to 1 of 4 dietary treatments (n = 4/treatment): 1) barley-based diet, 2) barley-based diet + exogenous enzyme, 3) oat-based diet, and 4) oat-based diet + enzyme. The enzyme supplement used contained endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase and endo-1,4-beta-xylanase. Experimental diets were formulated to contain similar concentrations of DE (13.5 MJ/kg) and digestible lysine (8.8 g/kg). Pigs offered oat-based diets had reduced digestibility of DM (0.795 vs. 0.849; SEM 0.007; P = 0.001), OM (0.808 vs. 0.865; SEM 0.007; P = 0.001), GE (0.806 vs. 0.845; SEM 0.006; P = 0.002), and NDF (0.233 vs. 0.423; SEM 0.033; P < 0.003) compared with those offered barley-based diets. Oat-based diets increased populations of Bifidobacterium spp. (7.26 vs. 6.38 log cfu/g of digesta; SEM 0.201; P = 0.005) and Lactobacillus spp. (6.99 vs. 6.18 log cfu/g of digesta; SEM 0.234; P = 0.022) in the proximal colon and decreased manure odor emissions [2,179.6 vs. 4,984.6 Ou(E)/m(3) (where Ou(E) refers to European odor units); SEM 653.7; P < 0.011] compared with barley-based diets. There was an interaction between cereal type and enzyme inclusion on manure ammonia emissions from 0 to 96 h (P = 0.050). Pigs offered barley-based diets containing an enzyme supplement had increased manure ammonia emissions compared with those offered unsupplemented barley-based diets. However, there was no effect of enzyme inclusion on oat-based diets. In conclusion, pigs offered oat-based diets harbored increased Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. populations in the proximal colon and had decreased manure odor emissions compared with those offered barley-based diets. Enzyme inclusion had no effect on manure ammonia emissions from pigs offered oat-based diets.",

      "abstract": "This review summarizes the recent knowledge about the positive effect of betaglucans on human health. Beta-glucans are polysaccharides occurring in the bran of cereal grains (barley and oats and to a much lesser degree in rye and wheat, in amounts of about 7%, 5%, 2% and less than 1%, respectively), the cell wall of baker's yeast, certain types of fungi, and many kinds of mushrooms. The differences between soluble and insoluble beta-glucans are significant in regards to application, mode of action, and overall biological activity. A growing body of science indicates that beta-glucans promote health in a number of important ways. Beta-glucans have been studied for their hypocholesterolemic effects; these mechanisms include: reducing the intestinal absorption of cholesterol and bile acids by binding to glucans; shifting the liver from cholesterol syntheses to bile acid production; and fermentation by intestinal bacteria to short-chain fatty acids, which are absorbed and inhibit hepatic cholesterol syntheses. Several studies have also shown that oat beta-glucans blunt the glycemic and insulin response. Moreover, beta-1,3-glucans improve the body's immune system defense against foreign invaders by enhancing the ability of macrophages, neutrophils and natural killer cells to respond to and fight a wide range of challenges such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Finally, there is renewed interest in the potential usefulness of beta-glucan as a radioprotective drug for chemotherapy, radiation therapy and nuclear emergencies, particularly because glucan can be used not only as a treatment, but also as a prophylactic.",
