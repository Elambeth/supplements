      "abstract": "According to the close association between cancer and inflammation demonstrated in clinical data, the strategy of synergistic anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory therapy shows promising potential. However, challenges remain in the synthesis and development of co-delivery systems for synergistic therapy. Herein, an amphiphilic chondroitin sulfate-rosmarinic acid polymeric prodrug was synthesized, and then combined with DSPE-PEG to encapsulate doxorubicin, forming a redox-responsive nanomicelle (PRSC/DOX) delivery system. PRSC/DOX exhibited a particle size of 188.6 nm and remained stable in PBS for at least 7 days. PRSC/DOX was internalized into tumor cells via CD44 receptor-mediated endocytosis, and degraded by intracellular glutathione to release the drugs. The released doxorubicin killed tumor cells through chemotherapy, and rosmarinic acid inhibited tumor cell growth by suppressing inflammation levels in the tumor microenvironment. In vivo experiments showed a statistically significant decrease in the inflammation levels in mice, along with a considerable reduction in tumor volume. Consequently, the PRSC/DOX significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy through a synergistic therapy of chemotherapy and inflammation suppression."

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Single-blind, randomized controlled trial conducted at tertiary-care hospital in Italy. Women aged 21-65 with a history of rUTIs were randomized into three groups: fosfomycin, the dietary supplement, and a combination of both treatments. Primary outcome was frequency of rUTI episodes per month. RESULTS: Combination therapy demonstrated greatest reduction in rUTI episodes per month at 12 months compared to fosfomycin or supplement monotherapy (0.23 ± 0.37 vs 0.58 ± 0.67 and 1.12 ± 0.96 for fosfomycin and supplement monotherapy respectively; p < 0.05) and to supplement monotherapy at 6 months (0.69 ± 1.03 vs 1.43 ± 1.33; p < 0.05), with significant improvement of ICIQ-FLUTS domains compared to other groups at 12 months (p < 0.05). Combination therapy had lower number of women matching rUTI criteria (55.32% vs 76.47% and 84%; p < 0.05) and symptoms remission at 12 months (89.36% vs 56.86% and 20%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Combining fosfomycin and an integrated D-mannose supplement for managing rUTIs offers a potential reduction in antibiotic reliance. Further large-scale studies are recommended to confirm these findings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (CT.gov identifier: NCT06659016)."

      "abstract": "Background: Activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs) play a significant role during the onset of hepatic fibrosis, ultimately leading to excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) and other typical pathological features, and thus have become a popular target for the treatment of hepatic fibrosis. However, current aHSC-centric therapy strategies achieve unsatisfactory results, mainly due to the lack of approved anti-fibrosis drugs and sufficiently efficient aHSC-targeted delivery systems. In this study, our aim was to develop an Imatinib-loaded nanoparticle delivery system based on a chondroitin sulfate derivative to enhance aHSC targeting efficiency, improve the therapeutic effect for hepatic fibrosis, and investigate the underlying mechanism. Methods: The carboxyl group of chondroitin sulfate and the amino group of 1-hexadecylamine were linked by an amide bond in this study to produce the amphiphilic carrier CS-HDA. Then, the Imatinib-loaded nanoparticles (IM-CS NPs) were designed to efficiently target aHSCs through CD44-mediated endocytosis and effectively inhibit HSC overactivation via PDGF and TGF-β signaling pathways. Results: Both in vitro cellular uptake experiments and in vivo distribution experiments demonstrated that CS-HDA-modified nanoparticles (IM-CS NPs) exhibited a better targeting ability for aHSCs, which were subsequently utilized to treat carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatic fibrosis mouse models. Finally, significant fibrosis resolution was observed in the carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatic fibrosis mouse models after tail vein injection of the IM-CS NPs, along with their outstanding biocompatibility and biological safety. Conclusions: IM-loaded NPs based on an amphiphilic CS derivative have remarkable antifibrotic effects, providing a promising avenue for the clinical treatment of advanced hepatic fibrosis."

      "abstract": "Kashin-Beck disease (KBD) is a chronic and deformable osteoarthropathy linked to low selenium. Limited cartilage regeneration poses challenges for its treatment. Previous studies have found that chondroitin sulfate A-selenium nanoparticle (CSA-SeNP) protects chondrocytes. This study used label-free LC-MS/MS quantitative proteomics to identify differentially expressed proteins and pathways in KBD chondrocytes post-CSA-SeNP treatment. Western blot (WB) was used to verify the key differential proteins, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to observe the ultrastructure of chondrocytes. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed proteins mainly involved in RNA processing, translation, peptide biosynthesis, gene expression, rRNA metabolism, and ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis. Notably, 121 proteins were up-regulated, 27 down-regulated, and 117 specifically expressed in the CSA-SeNP group. Enriched KEGG pathways included ribosome biogenesis, mRNA surveillance, endoplasmic reticulum protein processing, and endocytosis. Proteins related to autophagy, ER stress, cell homeostasis, protein processing and transport, including PELO, WES1, PLAA, RRBP1, ARC1B, ARFGAP2, and SH3KBP1, were significantly up-regulated in the CSA-SeNP group. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that CSA-SeNP may exert protective effects on chondrocytes in adult patients with KBD mainly through the regulation of target proteins and pathways related to ribosome biogenesis, mRNA surveillance, endoplasmic reticulum protein processing, endocytosis, autophagy, ER stress, and cell homeostasis. Further studies with larger sample size and in vivo to identify, screen and verify the regulatory effects of target proteins and pathways may provide more information for elucidating the mechanism of CSA-SeNP in the treatment of KBD."

      "abstract": "Mitochondrial REDOX homeostasis is unbalanced by large amounts of reactive oxygen species production and reduced glutathione, leading to lipid oxidation-induced ferroptosis, which enhanced cancer immunotherapy. Thus, disrupting mitochondrial redox homeostasis represents a promising strategy for the treatment of lung cancer. In this study, a co-delivery system of based on chondroitin sulfate (CS) (CS-CA-CUR-TPP, CCCT) for natural medicines (Curcumin, CUR; and Cinnamaldehyde CA) was successfully constructed, which resulted in elevated ROS levels in cancer cells. Under the action of CS specifically targeting tumor cells, CCCT NPs is enriched and taken up by lung cancer cells. Acid responsiveness causes the CCCT NPs to break and escape from the lysosome, and CUR targets and destroys mitochondria under the action of mitochondrial target head triphenylphosphine (TPP). CA collaborates with CUR to produce large amounts of ROS and reduce GSH in a time-dependent manner in mitochondria for disruption of REDOX homeostasis, and triggers ferroptosis by reducing the expression of GXP4 and xCT proteins. The immunogenic cell death (ICD) after ferroptosis promotes interferon γ (IFN-γ), TNF-a, and IL-6 secretion. Our results desmontrat CCCT can promote inhibition of tumor growth by enhancing tumor immunogenicity. This study may provide a potential avenue for the advancement of self-delivery nanoparticles to overcome resistance to apoptosis in tumor therapy."

      "abstract": "Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), key components of the extracellular matrix and the glial scar that forms around central nervous system (CNS) injuries, are recognized for hindering neuronal regeneration. We previously demonstrated the potential of pleiotrophin (PTN) to induce neurite outgrowth even in the presence of inhibitory CSPGs. The effects of PTN on microglia and oligodendrocytes are not well described. Here, we examined how PTN administration alters the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) into mature oligodendrocytes in the presence of CSPGs using in vitro cell culture model. Moreover, we explored the effects of PTN on the inflammatory activity of microglia with and without inflammatory stimulation (IFN-γ) in a CSPG-rich environment. The data showed that the CSPG matrix inhibited the differentiation of OPCs into mature oligodendrocytes. PTN induced dose-dependent differentiation of OPCs into mature oligodendrocytes, with an optimal effect at 10 nM PTN. Moreover, PTN modified the immunological response of microglia in the presence of CSPGs, with reduced proinflammatory activity that was further reduced by PTN administration, in contrast to the increased release of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP 9). However, when IFN-γ-activated microglia were treated with PTN, proinflammatory signaling was stimulated at higher PTN concentrations (10 nM and 100 nM). Overall, our results indicate that PTN can overcome the inhibitory effect of CSPGs on the differentiation of OPCs into oligodendrocytes and can modulate inflammation mediated by CSPGs from microglia. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that PTN can effectively counteract the inhibitory effects of CSPGs on the differentiation of OPCs into mature oligodendrocytes while also modulating microglial responses to reduce proinflammatory activity and increase MMP-9 release. Thus, PTN has great potential to improve remyelination and neuroprotective strategies in the treatment of demyelinating diseases or any injury."

The O-glycopattern levels in colonic mucin are closely related to the its protective effect on function of the intestinal barrier. However, the effect of the SCCS on colonic mucin O-glycan has not been investigated. In this study, ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized allergic mice and SCCS treatment were used. Mouse colonic mucin O-glycome was released and analyzed through reductive β-elimination combined with PGC-LC-MS. A total of presumptive 20 neutral and 28 acidic O-glycan structures were identified, in which the core 2 type acidic O-glycan structure is predominant in Balb/c female mice. Treatment with OVA and SCCS did not change the numbers of colon mucin O-glycan type, but the expression level of total O-glycosylation was more abundant in the SCCS group mice than in the OVA group (1.8-fold), especially for acidic O-glycans (co-modified by fucose and sulfate groups). Furthermore, supplementation with SCCS reversed most of the O-glycan decreasing trend, which may be associated with a return to healthy levels of gut microbiota. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that SCCS could restore colonic mucin O-glycosylation levels and intestinal homeostasis and contribute to enhancing intestinal barrier function."

      "abstract": "Anthocyanins (ACNs) are widely used in the culinary, cosmetic, and biomedical industries owing to their potent bioactivities. However, the rapid degradation of ACNs in extreme environments is a major limiting factor for their physicochemical stability and bioactivity. This study reported a facile and environmental-friendly ACN embedding strategy using chondroitin sulfate (CS) and whey protein isolate (WPI) to prepare the CS/WPI@ACN complex. The encapsulation efficiency of CS/WPI@ACN reached up to 84.87 % when the CS-to-WPI mass ratio was 1:5, and the core-to-wall material ratio was 1:3. Molecular docking analysis revealed that the CS/WPI complex harbored a concave chamber, which was conducive for the embedding of small ACN molecules and promoting drug activity. The CS/WPI@ACN complex enabled sustained ACN release in the gastrointestinal tract in vitro. The CS/WPI@ACN complex was stable under ascorbic acid treatment conditions, high temperatures, and a wide range of pH levels. In vitro release data demonstrated that most encapsulated ACNs were released in the small intestine. Furthermore, the antioxidant activity of the CS/WPI@ACN complex was higher than that of free ACN. Therefore, this study proposed a strategy to protect unstable active substances, and laid a foundation for blueberry anthocyanins in the high-value utilization of functional drinks.",

This innovative approach not only circumvents organ impairment but also enhances patient compliance. The acute toxicity of MEL is effectively mitigated by electrostatic binding with CS molecules, forming MC complexes that induce apoptosis in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). The MC-loaded CMNPs (MC@CCMNPs) exhibit remarkable therapeutic capacity with a notably meliorated joint damage and suppressed arthritis severity in the RA rat model. Therefore, MC@CCMNPs emerge as a promising anti-inflammatory and safe therapy for RA treatment, as well as for other inflammation related chronic diseases.",

Therefore, this work reported the synthesis and preparation of novel water-soluble rosmarinic acid-chondroitin sulfate A (RA-CSA) nanoconjugate, which was used for the treatment of UC in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced acute colitis mouse model. RA was functionalized with CSA as confirmed by FTIR and 1H NMR, and self-assembled to form nanoassemblies with a diameter of 247.3 ± 2.99 nm. RA-CSA nanoassemblies exhibited radical scavenging and antioxidant capacity. RA-CSA remarkably inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide and TNF-α production in RAW 264.7 cells without cytotoxicity, whose inhibition rate was <5 % at 200 μg mL-1. Oral administration of RA-CSA nanoassemblies significantly attenuated colonic inflammation compared to the parent RA, as evidenced by significantly reduced the shortening of colon length (4.20 ± 0.15 cm), body weight loss, and colonic inflammatory damage in DSS-induced colitis mice. In addition, RA-CSA nanoassemblies suppressed the expression and production of typical pro-inflammatory cytokines of ulcerative colitis. These results suggest that RA-CSA nanoassemblies deserve further consideration as a potential therapeutic drug for the treatment of UC."

      "abstract": "Inflammation and cartilage degeneration are critical challenges in osteoarthritis (OA) treatment. Achieving sustained drug efficacy while mitigating the adverse effects of inflammation and reactive oxygen species remains a significant challenge. This study synthesizes a gallic acid-magnesium (GA-Mg) metal-organic framework (MOF) as a drug carrier for puerarin (PA). The PA-loaded GA-Mg MOF (pGM) is encapsulated within chondroitin sulfate methacrylate, forming monodisperse hybrid microspheres (CM@pGM) under ultraviolet light using microfluidic technology. The pGM is physically confined within the microspheres through a network of structural obstructions and noncovalent interactions. During degradation, GA and Mg2+ ions release from pGM, improving the inflammatory microenvironment of the articular cavity and mitigating oxidative stress. The sustained release of Mg2+ and PA supports chondrocyte anabolism and facilitates cartilage repair. In vitro studies confirm that injectable microspheres extend the drug release period to over 2 weeks. In vivo experiments demonstrate that CM@pGM significantly reduces osteophyte formation, alleviates degenerative changes in articular cartilage, and delays OA progression. In conclusion, CM@pGM, as a drug delivery platform that ameliorates the inflammatory microenvironment, alleviates oxidative stress, and promotes cartilage repair, holds significant potential for OA treatment.",

      "abstract": "High drug-loading nanocrystals show significant advantages in delivering hydrophobic small-molecule drugs. However, these nanocrystals face challenges, including inherent instability and limited targetability. In this study, we developed a paclitaxel nanocrystal delivery platform based on chondroitin sulfate modified with 3-indoleacetic acid (CS-IAA). Paclitaxel and CS-IAA assembled into stable nanocrystals (PTX@CS-IAA, PC) with a high drug loading (up to 46.6%), facilitated by π-π stacking and hydrophobic interactions. CS-IAA targets tumors through CD44 receptors, which helps to minimize off-target effects. Additionally, CS-IAA, serving as a functional delivery vehicle, can significantly increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels at the tumor site. In an orthotopic pancreatic cancer mouse model, PTX@CS-IAA nanocrystals showed significantly enhanced antitumor effects. When PTX@CS-IAA was combined with the αPD-L1 antibody, the survival of mice with pancreatic tumors was further prolonged. This study provides valuable insights into alternative treatment options for pancreatic cancer, with the potential to improve patient prognosis and survival.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The main purpose of the study was the formulation development of nanogels (NHs) composed of chondroitin sulfate (CS) and low molecular weight chitosan (lCH), loaded with a naringenin-β-cyclodextrin complex (NAR/β-CD), as a potential treatment for early-stage diabetic retinopathy. METHODS: Different formulations of NHs were prepared by varying polymer concentration, lCH ratio, and pH and, then, characterized for particle size, zeta potential, particle concentration (particles/mL) and morphology. Cytotoxicity and internalization were assessed in vitro using Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC). The NAR/β-CD complex was prepared and evaluated for morphology, complexation efficiency, and solubility. Finally, the most promising NH prototype was loaded with NAR/β-CD (NH@NAR/β-CD) and further characterized for encapsulation efficiency, loading capacity, opacity and cytotoxicity on HUVEC; in vitro release test and DPPH assay were performed to investigate NH capability to sustain NAR release and NH@NAR/β-CD antioxidant properties, respectively. RESULTS: NH properties were influenced by polymer concentration, lCH ratio, and pH. N3 (0.5 mg/mL; lCH=1.5:1; pH = 5) and N9 (0.5 mg/mL; lCH=1:1; pH = 5) showed optimal characteristics, including small size (<350 nm) and positive zeta potential, facilitating cellular uptake. The NAR/β-CD complex showed 71% complexation efficiency and enhanced NAR solubility. Since characterized by superior properties and better in vitro biocompatibility, N3 was loaded with NAR/β-CD. N3@NAR/β-CD capability to sustain in vitro NAR release, radical scavenging activity and in vitro biocompatibility were finally demonstrated. CONCLUSION: The physico-chemical properties of N3@NAR/β-CD were responsible for their cell uptake, suggesting their potential to target retinal endothelial cells. The high NAR/β-CD complexation efficiency and the sustained NAR release over 72 hours could guarantee the maintenance of an effective drug concentration at the damage site while reducing the injection number. Further studies about the safety and the effectiveness of the intravitreal injection of NHs@NAR/β-CD will be performed on a diabetic animal model.",

The particle size, PDI and %EE of optimized TZCNPs was found 208.7 ± 7.26 nm,0.173 ± 0.004, and 80.18 ± 1.03 %, respectively. TZCNPs demonstrate a 7-10 folds increase in cytotoxicity against free TFM in MDA-MB-231 cells and a 4-6 folds increase in MCF-7 cells, respectively. CD44 receptor blocking resulted in a 3.4-fold reduction in anti-cancer efficacy and a 1.7-fold decrease in cellular uptake of TZCNPs in MDA-MB-231 cells, significantly/strongly indicating the critical role of the CD44-mediated uptake mechanism. TZCNPs displayed enhanced apoptosis, mitochondrial depolarization, ROS generation, cell invasion inhibition, and inhibited colony formation compared to free TFM in MDA-MB-231 cells. TZCNPs exhibited approximately 6.8-fold enhanced cytotoxicity and a 1.66-fold decrease in spheroid volume in a multicellular tumor spheroid model of MDA-MB-231 cells compared to free TFM. TZCNPs also exhibited greater disintegration of spheroids and more dead cells (live/dead staining). In pharmacokinetic studies, TZCNPs displayed reduced CL and enhanced the AUC, MRT, and t ½ by 3.64-fold, 2.17-fold, 1.83-fold, and 1.73-fold than the free TFM suspension. An acute toxicity study revealed a good safety profile of TZCNPs, which could be a potential treatment option for TNBC.",

Background/Objectives: Solid lipid nanoparticles are increasingly recognized for their biocompatibility, their ability to encapsulate diverse compounds, their capacity to enhance drug stability, their bioavailability, and their therapeutic efficacy. Methods: CHON, a naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan with anti-inflammatory and regenerative properties, was integrated into SLN formulations using the hot microemulsion technique. Two formulations (SLN-1 and SLN-2) were produced and optimized by evaluating critical physicochemical properties such as particle size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency (EE%), and stability. The lyophilization process, with the addition of various cryoprotectants, revealed trehalose to be the most effective agent in maintaining nanoparticle integrity and functional properties. Results: Morphological analyses using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) confirmed the dimensions of the nanoscales and their structural uniformity. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed minimal excipient interaction with CHON, ensuring formulation stability. Stability studies under different environmental conditions highlighted that SLN-2 is the most stable formulation, maintaining superior encapsulation efficiency (≥88%) and particle size consistency over time. Conclusions: These findings underscore the potential of CHON-loaded SLNs as promising candidates for targeted, sustained-release therapies in the treatment of inflammatory and degenerative diseases."

      "abstract": "Melanoma is characterized by its aggressiveness, high metastatic potential, and numerous mutations, which limit the effectiveness of current treatments. To address this issue, we developed a dissolvable microneedle (MN) system composed of poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEtOz) and chondroitin sulfate (CS). This MN system was loaded with liposomes containing both a NIR-II photothermal small molecule (IRLy) and the natural anticancer agent Gambogic acid (GA), forming Lip(IRLy + GA) MNs. The integration of the dissolvable microneedle with drug-loaded liposomes aligns with the mechanical properties and skin penetration efficiency required for effective drug delivery. It enables minimally invasive, painless, and precise administration of IRLy and GA. Under NIR-II 1064 nm laser irradiation, Lip(IRLy + GA) effectively inhibited melanoma by disrupting blood vessels, inducing apoptosis, and altering mitochondrial membrane potential. In a subcutaneous melanoma (A375) model in nude mice, the combination of Lip(IRLy + GA) and laser treatment demonstrated a synergistic effect, enhancing both photothermal and chemotherapeutic outcomes. This research presents a promising strategy that combines NIR-II photothermal agents with natural chemotherapeutic drugs and highlights the potential of microneedles in combination therapies for superficial skin cancers like melanoma.",

      "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major public health threat due to its high incidence and mortality rates. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), the primary treatment for intermediate-to-advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), commonly utilizes embolic agents loaded with anthracycline-based cytotoxic drugs. Post-TACE, the hypoxic microenvironment in the tumor induced by embolization stimulates the formation of new blood vessels, potentially leading to revascularization and diminishing TACE's efficacy. In clinical practice, combined therapy for liver cancer using TACE and oral targeted drugs often encounters the limitation that targeted drugs cannot efficiently reach the tumor site following TACE. We have developed chondroitin sulfate microspheres (CMs) capable of encapsulating both the cytotoxic drug idarubicin (Ida) and the vascular inhibitor Lenvatinib (Len), thereby achieving a triple therapeutic effect on liver cancer: embolic starvation, drug toxicity, and efficient inhibition of neovascularization."

In this study, the impacts of CS on obese mice induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) were investigated. The results showed that supplementing CS effectively controlled body weight gain and fat accumulation (perirenal fat and epididymal fat) compared to the control group of obese mice. Furthermore, supplementation with CS reduced the levels of glucose and triglyceride in the serum. Analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing data illustrated that the diet supplemented with CS modified the composition of gut microbiota, particularly resulting in a reduction of Desulfobacterota and an increase in Bacteroides abundance. Correlation analysis suggested significant associations between specific gut microbiota taxa and obese phenotypes. Overall, these findings highlight that dietary intervention with CS may provide a promising strategy to mitigate obesity and its related symptoms, likely involving the role of gut microbiota in obese mice. This research offers compelling scientific evidence supporting the anti-obesity potential of CS as a dietary supplement.",

Discontinuation or suspension of this therapy is often due to local side effects. Aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sequential intravesical instillations of combined hyaluronic acid (HA) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) in reducing local BCG toxicity and urinary symptoms. METHODS: This was a prospective, multicentric study. Patients underwent BCG intravesical administration after Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor (TURBT) for intermediate/high-risk NMIBC. Patients underwent to HA + CS instillations after every (i) BCG (Group A) were compared with a control group (Group B) that included patient underwent only to BCG instillations, during the maintenance period. 3-day voiding diary, the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), IPSS quality-of-life index (IPSS-QoL), and VAS score (to evaluate bladder pain) were evaluated at baseline and at 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow- up. RESULTS: One hundred-eighteen patients were included (Group A: 63 patients, Group B: 55 patients). Mean value of IPSS, IPSS-QoL, and VAS score has significantly increase in Group A at 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-up (p < 0.00). Group A showed also a significant improvement about irritative lower urinary symptoms (LUTS), which was maintained in the 6-month follow-up, as opposed to Group B that demonstrated a worsening in urinary symptoms during all follow-up (p < 0.00). No local or major side effects were reported during or after treatment. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that adding (i) HA + CS significantly reduces storage symptoms, pelvic pain, and day-time urinary frequency in patients with BCG-induced chemical cystitis. This therapy could therefore improve patient adherence, ensuring better adherence and lower drop-out rates."

The lipid metabolism dysregulation promotes M1 macrophage polarization by coordinating the compensatory pathways of the inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Here, a self-assembling, licofelone-loaded nanoparticle (termed LCF-CSBN), comprising chondroitin sulfate and bilirubin joined by an ethylenediamine linker, is developed to selectively reprogram lipid metabolism in macrophage activation. LCF-CSBN is internalized by M1 macrophages via CD44-mediated endocytosis and targets the Golgi apparatus accompanied with the reactive oxygen species-responsive release of licofelone (LCF, dual inhibitor of arachidonic acid metabolism). LCF-CSBN effectively promotes M1 to M2 macrophage transition by reprogramming the Golgi apparatus-related sphingolipid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism. Intra-articularly injected LCF-CSBN retains in the joint for up to 28 days and accumulates into M1 macrophages. Moreover, LCF-CSBN can effectively attenuate joint inflammation, oxidative stress, and cartilage degeneration in OA model rats. These findings indicate the promising potential of lipid-metabolism-reprogramming LCF-CSBN in the targeted therapy of OA.",

These compounds were then used to formulate liposomes of 63 to 95 nm in size composed of 19.38% of DHA and 7.44% of EPA and encapsulating CS extract with a Δdi-4S/Δdi-6S ratio of 0.53 at 2 weight masses (10-30 kDa and >30 kDa) or CS standard all at two different concentrations. Liposomes were tested on human chondrocytes in inflamed conditions. Thus, compatibility tests, the expression of various inflammation markers at transcriptional and molecular levels, nitrites, and the amount of collagenase produced were analyzed. The results showed that CS, in synergy with the liposomes, played a positive role in combating chondrocyte inflammation even at a low concentration.",

      "abstract": "Osteosarcoma is a highly aggressive tumor that originates in the bone and often infiltrates nearby bone cells. It is the most prevalent type of primary bone cancer among the various bone malignancies. Traditional cancer treatment methods such as surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy have had restricted success. However, the integration of nanotechnology into cancer research has led to notable progress. One promising area is the use of marine-derived polysaccharide-based nano formulations for treating various human diseases, including cancer. This study presents a straightforward method for synthesizing biocompatible gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), utilizing sodium borohydride as a reducing agent and a cost-effective, water-soluble chondroitin sulfate (CS) derived from shark cartilage as a stabilizing agent. The synthesized CS-Au NPs appeared purple and were mainly spherical, with 40.768 nm of average size. Cytotoxicity assays (MTT) indicated that CS-Au NPs significantly reduced the viability of human osteosarcoma cells (MG63) at 100 μg/mL, while it showed no cytotoxic effects on mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (NIH3T3) at the same concentration. The observed toxicity of the CS-Au NPs was linked to a rise in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within damaged mitochondria. ROS generation and changes in mitochondrial membrane potential were detected in MG63 cells treated with CS-Au NPs. Furthermore, apoptotic analysis through ethidium bromide dual staining and flow cytometry demonstrated that CS-Au NPs at higher concentrations significantly increased the amount of apoptotic cells, as demonstrated by acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining. Flow cytometry also confirmed that CS-Au NPs activated the apoptotic pathway in MG63 cells.",

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a pervasive degenerative joint disease affecting companion animals, characterized by chronic inflammation and cartilage degradation. However, the effectiveness of chondroitin sulfate (CS) in treating OA in dogs and cats remains controversial. This study aimed to determine the therapeutic effects and molecular mechanisms of CS on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in feline and canine articular chondrocytes (FAC and CAC) at the cellular level in vitro. Our findings demonstrated that CS treatment (800 µg/mL) significantly enhanced cell viability and reduced oxidative stress in FAC and CAC, as evidenced by decreased levels of reactive oxygen species and increased activities of antioxidant enzymes. Furthermore, CS treatment effectively suppressed LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-8, interleukin-10, and matrix metalloproteinases-3, and reduced apoptosis, as confirmed by fluorescence staining and flow cytometry. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that CS upregulated neurotrophic signaling pathways, promoting cell survival and proliferation. Metabolomic analysis indicated that CS treatment upregulated metabolites associated with glycerophospholipid and purine metabolism, suggesting enhanced membrane integrity and energy metabolism. Conversely, pathways involved in protein catabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism were downregulated, indicating a reduction in inflammatory mediators. Collectively, these findings elucidate the multifaceted role of CS in modulating chondrocyte metabolism and inflammatory responses, highlighting its potential to alleviate OA.",

However, there have been few studies of the associated drug targets. This study combined bioinformatics analysis and molecular docking to screen the main targets of FCS intervention in LUAD. Moreover, an experimental validation was performed. First, we downloaded the LUAD gene data set from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and the cisplatin (DDP) resistance gene data set of LUAD A549 cells from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Nine significant genes (PLK1, BUB1, CDK1, CDC20, CCNB1, BUB1B, KIF11, CCNB2, and DLAGP5) were identified by bioinformatics analysis, and these nine genes overlapped in both data sets. Then, molecular docking results showed that FCS had a better affinity with target proteins BUB1 and PLK1. Further experimental verification revealed that FCS inhibited the growth of A549 cells and increased the sensitivity of A549 cells to DDP. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) revealed that A549 cells treated with FCS exhibited down-regulated BUB1 and PLK1 mRNA expression. At the same time, FCS+DDP treatment resulted in a more significant reduction in BUB1 and PLK1 mRNA expression than DDP or FCS treatment alone. These findings reveal potential targets of FCS for LUAD and provide clues for the development of FCS as a potential anticancer agent."

      "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by the absence of the full form of the dystrophin protein, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cells, including those in the heart and respiratory system. Despite progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms associated with DMD, myocardial insufficiency persists as the primary cause of mortality, and existing therapeutic strategies remain limited. This study investigates the hypothesis that a dysregulation of the biological communication between infiltrating macrophages (MPs) and neurocardiac junctions exists in dystrophic cardiac tissue. In a mouse model of DMD (mdx), this phenomenon is influenced by the over-release of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan-4 (CSPG4), a key inhibitor of nerve sprouting and a modulator of the neural function, by MPs infiltrating the cardiac tissue and associated with dilated cardiomyopathy, a hallmark of DMD. Givinostat, the histone deacetylase inhibitor under current development as a clinical treatment for DMD, is effective at both restoring a physiological microenvironment at the neuro-cardiac junction and cardiac function in mdx mice in addition to a reduction in cardiac fibrosis, MP-mediated inflammation, and tissue CSPG4 content. This study provides novel insight into the pathophysiology of DMD in the heart, identifying potential new biological targets. © 2024 The Author(s).

Based on the expression of the CD44 receptor on renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) and activated M1 macrophages being abnormally increased, accompanied by up-regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during AKI, the conjugates of bilirubin (BR), an endogenous antioxidant which has the property of anti-inflammation, and chondroitin sulfate (CS) with CD44-targeting property could be a promising therapeutic carrier. In this study, we develop a CD44-targeted/ROS-responsive CS-BR-mediated multifunctional liposome loading celastrol (CS-BR@CLT) for the targeted therapy of AKI. CS-BR@CLT is shown to selectively accumulate in AKI mouse kidneys via targeting of CD44 receptors. Treatment with CS-BR@CLT significantly ameliorates acute kidney injury caused by ischemia-reperfusion and protects renal function. Mechanistically, CS-BR@CLT inhibits apoptosis, protects mitochondria, promotes autophagy, regulates macrophage polarization, and alleviates interstitial inflammation. Overall, our study demonstrates that CS-BR@CLT could be a promising strategy to ameliorate acute kidney injury.",

This study explores the combined effects of quercetin, a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory flavonoid, and chondroitin sulfate, known for its cartilage-protective properties, as a potential therapeutic approach. Molecular docking analyses revealed favourable interactions between these compounds and key pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α, suggesting their potential to disrupt inflammation-related signaling pathways. In vitro assays demonstrated that the quercetin-chondroitin sulfate combination (1:1 ratio) significantly inhibited oxidative stress and hemolysis, highlighting its enhanced anti-inflammatory and membrane-protective effects. The free radical scavenging assays further confirmed the antioxidant potential of this combination, which demonstrated strong radical scavenging activity. Antimicrobial assays showed notable antibacterial effects, with an increased inhibition zone against P. mirabilis when quercetin and chondroitin sulfate were combined, suggesting a synergistic antimicrobial action. In vivo, zebrafish subjected to bacterial stress showed improved survival rates with the quercetin and chondroitin sulfate combination treatment, along with enhanced mineralization and significant modulation of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activities, indicating its protective role in maintaining joint health. Furthermore, gene expression analysis revealed a substantial reduction in pro-inflammatory markers, including TNF-α and IL-6, demonstrating the quercetin and chondroitin sulfate combination's ability to mitigate inflammation. Together, these findings suggest that the quercetin and chondroitin sulfate combination hold significant therapeutic potential in reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and microbial-induced RA exacerbations.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In a previously published randomised, placebo-controlled trial, 800 mg/day of pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate (CS) was shown to be superior to placebo in reducing pain and improving function over 6 months in patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA). The aim of the current post hoc analyses was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of CS compared with placebo in a European perspective using individual patient data from this clinical trial. METHODS: Patients with knee OA randomised to CS or placebo were followed up at 1, 3 and 6 months. The algo-functional Lequesne index was used to derive the EuroQol Five-Dimension Five-Level (EQ-5D-5L) score based on a validated formula. The EQ-5D-5L scores at each time point were used to calculate the changes in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with the area under the curve method. Costs were assessed using the average price of CS in the countries where the original study took place and where CS is currently marketed. The costs of CS in three countries were then used (i.e. the Czech Republic, Italy and Switzerland). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) threshold for CS to be considered cost-effective was set at 91,870 EUR per QALY (equivalent to the usually recommended threshold of US $100,000). The study used an intention-to-treat population, i.e. patients who received one dose of the study drug, and imputed missing values using the basal observation carried forward method. RESULTS: No significant differences in baseline characteristics were observed between the CS group (N = 199) and the placebo group (N = 205). The mean cost of CS for 6 months of treatment was 194.74 EUR. After 6 months of treatment, CS showed a mean ICER of 33,462 (95% CI 5130-61,794) EUR per QALY gained, indicating cost-effectiveness compared with placebo. The acceptability curve for cost-effectiveness shows that the CS treatment is likely to be cost-effective compared with placebo, with a 93% probability when the ceiling ratio is set at 91,870 EUR per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the role of CS as a cost-effective therapeutic option in the management of OA. However, further studies taking into account the use of other healthcare resources are warranted for a more complete understanding.",

      "abstract": "In the inflammatory microenvironment of atherosclerotic plaques, metabolic dysregulation of superoxide anion (O2-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) leads to the activation of feedback mechanisms involving IL-1β, TNF-α, and MCP-1, which triggers inflammatory cascades between macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in atherosclerosis (AS). To address this, a chondroitin sulfate (CS)-functionalized dual-targeted engineered nanozyme, CS-Lip/PB@Rap, was developed by encapsulating mesoporous Prussian blue nanoparticles (PBs) loaded with rapamycin (Rap) within CS-modified liposomes. CS functionalization endowed CS-Lip/PB@Rap with a specific targeting ability for CD44 receptors, thus enabling targeted delivery to inflammatory macrophages and VSMCs. Moreover, its enhanced multiple enzyme-like activities effectively modulated the imbalance of oxidative stress. The underlying mechanism of crosstalk regulation by these engineered nanozymes may inhibit the NF-κB pathway by restoring normal metabolism of O2- and H2O2, thereby blocking the TNF-α, IL-1β, and MCP-1 feedback loops between macrophages and VSMCs. This process reduced the production of inflammatory macrophages and inhibited the VSMC transformation from a contractile phenotype to a synthetic phenotype, preventing the formation of fibrous caps. Furthermore, the elimination of oxidative stress could decrease the production of oxygenized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), which inhibited the formation of foam cells and alleviated the atherogenic progression.",

Following structural verification using various analytical techniques, we applied targeted metabolomics to examine the impact of FCS on nutritional efficacy and its structure-activity relationship. Analysis of 225 plasma and feces samples from 75 mice revealed a positive correlation between metabolomic shifts and increased weight gain, underscoring FCS's potential to enhance nutrient absorption and promote growth. The observed linear relationship between the levels of short-chain fatty acids in plasma and feces suggests that FCS may facilitate catabolic activities in the gastrointestinal tract. The comparative study of different FCS derivatives on mouse growth and metabolic homeostasis regulation led to the conclusion that FCS exhibits greater biological activity with a higher degree of branching and larger molecular weight.",

The AD mouse model was established by subcutaneous injection of D-galactose (D-gal) combined with gavage of AlCl3 for 30 consecutive days, and then drug intervention was performed in the administration group for 40 consecutive days. The findings demonstrated several positive effects of CS@Se on AD mice. Firstly, CS@Se improved spatial learning and memory problems and reduces anxiety in AD mice. It also significantly reduced pyramidal cell arrangement disorder and rupture, leading to an improvement in synaptic structure damage between hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, CS@Se reduced mitochondrial swelling and vacuolation while increasing neuron survival in AD mice. Moreover, CS@Se significantly impacted the diversity and richness of intestinal flora in AD mice. It increased the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria while reducing the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. In conclusion, CS@Se effectively reduced the breakdown of hippocampal pyramidal cells, improved the superfiber structure of hippocampal neurons, and restored intestinal flora balance, ultimately contributing to improving learning and memory abilities and alleviating anxiety in AD mice."

Therefore, more and more attention has been focused on the regulation of TME by preventing the cross-talk between tumor cells and CAFs in the treatment of breast cancer. In this study, we have combined the benefits of deep drug penetration, pH sensitivity, and tumor-targeting delivery to prepare chondroitin sulphate (CS)-based nanomicelles (BBR/CS-DOX) for the co-delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) and berberine (BBR). A unique MCF-7 + MRC-5 co-cultured cell model and 4 T1 + NIH3T3 co-implanted mice model, were established to simulate the TME of breast cancer (BC). As expected, BBR/CS-DOX could accumulate in tumor egion, be taken up by both tumor cells and CAFs, and improve drug absorption and retention. Compared with free drugs, BBR/CS-DOX demonstrated stonger pro-apoptotic and anti-metastatic effect in vitro and in vivo, respectively the histological studies showed that BBR/CS-DOX efficiently prevented the activation of fibroblasts, inhibited extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, and decreased tumor angiogenesis, showing superior anti-tumor efficacy. In summary, BBR/CS-DOX has the potential to significantly enhance the therapeutic effect of breast cancer through inhibiting the \"CAFs-tumor cells\" crosstalk, and has promising clinical application prospects.",

      "abstract": "Immunotherapies, including checkpoint inhibitor antibodies, have precipitated significant improvements in clinical outcomes for melanoma. However, approximately half of patients do not benefit from approved treatments. Additionally, apart from Tebentafusp, which is approved for the treatment of uveal melanoma, there is a lack of immunotherapies directly focused on melanoma cells. This is partly due to few available targets, especially those expressed on the cancer cell surface. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) is a cell surface molecule overexpressed in human melanoma, with restricted distribution and low expression in non-malignant tissues and involved in several cancer-promoting and dissemination pathways. Here, we summarize the current understanding of the expression and functional significance of CSPG4 in health and melanoma, and we outline immunotherapeutic strategies. These include monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), chimeric-antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, and other strategies such as anti-idiotypic and mimotope vaccines to raise immune responses against CSPG4-expressing melanomas. Several showed promising functions in preclinical models of melanoma, yet few have reached clinical testing, and none are approved for therapeutic use. Obstacles preventing that progress include limited knowledge of CSPG4 function in human cancer and a lack of in vivo models that adequately represent patient immune responses and human melanoma biology. Despite several challenges, immunotherapy directed to CSPG4-expressing melanoma harbors significant potential to transform the treatment landscape."

      "abstract": "Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common pediatric extracranial solid tumor. High-risk NB is a subset of the disease that has poor prognosis and requires multimodal treatment regimens, with a 50% rate of recurrence despite intervention. There is a need for improved treatment strategies to reduce high-risk patient mortality. Dinutuximab is an anti-GD2 antibody ideal for targeting GD2 expressing NB cells, but binding of the antibody to peripheral nerve fibers leads to severe pain during systemic administration. Intratumoral delivery of the anti-GD2 antibody would allow for increased local antibody concentration, without increasing systemic toxicity. Chondroitin Sulfate (CS) is a biocompatible glycosaminoglycan that can be methacrylated to form CSMA, a photocrosslinkable hydrogel that can be loaded with therapeutic agents. The methacrylation reaction time can be varied to achieve different degrees of substitution, resulting in different release and degradation profiles. In this work, 4 and 24 h reacted CSMA was used to create hydrogels at 10% and 20% CSMA. Sustained in vitro release of dinutuximab from these formulations was observed over a 24-day period, and 4 h reacted 10% CSMA hydrogels had the highest overall dinutuximab release over time. An orthotropic mouse model was used to evaluate in vivo response to dinutuximab loaded 4 h methacrylated 10% CSMA hydrogels as compared to bolus tail vein injections. Tumor growth was monitored, and there was a statistically significant increase in the days to reach specific tumor size for tumors treated with intratumoral dinutuximab-loaded hydrogel compared to those treated with dinutuximab solution through tail vein injection. This supports the concept that locally delivering dinutuximab within the hydrogel formulation slowed tumor growth. The CSMA hydrogel-only treatment slowed tumor growth as well, an interesting effect that may indicate interactions between the CSMA and cell adhesion molecules in the tumor microenvironment. These findings demonstrate a potential avenue for local sustained delivery of dinutuximab for improved anti-tumoral response in high-risk NB.",

METHODS: The study was designed retrospectively and included patients who underwent MOWHTO due to gonarthrosis, the MF method performed on these patients, and HA + GC treatments applied in addition to MF. Three groups consisting of 79 patients were formed: only HTO (Group 1), HTO + MF (Group 2), and HTO + MF + HA + GC (Group 3). The groups were compared using knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS), visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and range of motion (ROM). The associations between the degree of correction and function and pain were evaluated. Additionally, the KOOS subparameters were compared between the groups. RESULTS: There were significant improvements in the postoperative KOOS and VAS scores in all three groups (p < 0.05). However, the ROM did not improve in Group 1. There was no significant difference in the postoperative KOOS, VAS, or ROM values ​​between Groups 2 and 3, but these values ​​were significantly better in Groups 2 and 3 than in Group 1 (p < 0.05). When the degree of correction increased, there were no significant positive changes in the postoperative KOOS or VAS score in Group 1, unlike in the other two groups (p < 0.05). In corrections of ≥ 10°, while there was no significant difference in the postoperative KOOS or VAS score ​​between Groups 2 and 3, these parameters significantly improved in these two groups compared to Group 1 (p < 0.05). Among the KOOS subparameters, pain and activities of daily living scores ​​were greater in Groups 2 and 3 than in Group 1 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In MOWHTO, MF is a sufficient treatment method that improves the patient's clinical condition without requiring additional treatments such as HA and GC.

It is often used in osteoarthritis (OA) treatment. Due to conflicting results from clinical trials on CHON's efficacy in OA treatment, there has been a shift toward exploring effective topical systems utilizing nanotechnology. This study aimed to optimize a solid lipid nanoparticle formulation aiming to enhance CHON permeation for OA therapy. A 3 × 3 × 2 Design of these experiments determined the ideal parameters: a CHON concentration of 0.4 mg/mL, operating at 20,000 rpm speed, and processing for 10 min for SLN production. Transmission electron microscopy analysis confirmed the nanoparticles' spherical morphology, ensuring crucial uniformity for efficient drug delivery. Cell viability assessments showed no significant cytotoxicity within the tested parameters, indicating a safe profile for potential clinical application. The cell internalization assay indicates successful internalization at 1.5 h and 24 h post-treatment. Biopharmaceutical studies supported SLNs, indicating them to be effective CHON carriers through the skin, showcasing improved skin permeation and CHON retention compared to conventional methods. In summary, this study successfully optimized SLN formulation for efficient CHON transport through pig ear skin with no cellular toxicity, highlighting SLNs' potential as promising carriers to enhance CHON delivery in OA treatment and advance nanotechnology-based therapeutic strategies in pharmaceutical formulations.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: HFD-fed C57BL/6J mice receive dietary gavage intervention of CHS for 18 weeks. Blood, liver tissue, and feces are harvested for further investigation. Results show that CHS inhibits ER stress, accompanied by lowered blood glucose, nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen (ROS), and free fatty acids (FFA) levels, and increases hepatic glycogen accumulation. Moreover, hepatic inflammation is improved by CHS treatment via inactivation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling and its downstream c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) pathways. Additionally, CHS regulates gut microbiota, particularly the decline in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. CHS also lowers fecal lipopolysaccharide and elevates several fecal short chain fatty acids. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that CHS from H. burgeri skin may be an alternative functional food supplement for anti-ER stress, anti-inflammtion, and regulation of gut microbiota.",

      "abstract": "Postoperative adhesion is a common clinical disease caused by surgical trauma, accompanying serious subsequent complications. Current non-surgical drug therapy and biomaterial barrier administration have limited therapeutic effects due to their inherent deficiencies. Therefore, developing a simple, effective, and feasible method to effectively prevent postoperative adhesions after surgical procedures remains a challenge. An injectable chondroitin sulfate complex hydrogel was prepared based on aldehyde-modified chondroitin sulfate (ChS-CHO) and hydrazine-modified chondroitin sulfate (ChS-ADH). The hydrogel showed enhanced strength and good self-healing ability. By using the Schiff base reaction principle that aldehyde group reacts with hydrazide to form hydrazone bond, C-A hydrogel physical barrier is formed at the wound site to reduce the occurrence of postoperative adhesion. There is no use of chemical crosslinkers in the whole reaction system to prepare C-A hydrogel, which has excellent biocompatibility and is safe and non-toxic. The results showed that C-A hydrogel showed excellent mechanical properties, good self-healing, and biocompatibility. The cecal-abdominal wall adhesion model and hepatic adhesion model of rats were constructed respectively to evaluate its preventive effect on postoperative adhesion. The results showed that C-A hydrogel had a more significant preventive effect on postoperative adhesion, and appears to be a promising candidate for postoperative adhesion.",

      "abstract": "Erastin, a ferroptosis-inducing system xc- inhibitor, faces clinical challenges due to suboptimal physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties, as well as relatively low potency and off-target toxicity. Addressing these, we developed ECINs, a novel laser-responsive erastin-loaded nanomedicine utilizing indocyanine green (ICG)-grafted chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) derivatives. Our aim was to improve erastin's tumor targeting via CSA-CD44 interactions and enhance its antitumor efficacy through ICG's photothermal and photodynamic effects in the laser-on state while minimizing off-target effects in the laser-off state. ECINs, with their nanoscale size of 186.7 ± 1.1 nm and high erastin encapsulation efficiency of 93.0 ± 0.8%, showed excellent colloidal stability and sustained drug release up to 120 h. In vitro, ECINs demonstrated a mechanism of cancer cell inhibition via G1-phase cell cycle arrest, indicating a non-ferroptotic action. In vivo biodistribution studies in SK-HEP-1 xenograft mice revealed that ECINs significantly enhanced tumor distribution of erastin (1.9-fold greater than free erastin) while substantially reducing off-target accumulation in the lungs and spleen by 203-fold and 19.1-fold, respectively. Combined with laser irradiation, ECINs significantly decreased tumor size (2.6-fold, compared to free erastin; 2.4-fold, compared to ECINs without laser irradiation) with minimal systemic toxicity. This study highlights ECINs as a dual-modality approach for liver cancer treatment, demonstrating significant efficacy against tumors overexpressing CD44 and system xc-.",

In the present study, we examined the efficacy of a combination of chondroitin sulfate and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum CCFM8661 (CCFM8661 + CS) on tissue Pb accumulation and pathological damage to the liver and kidneys, gut microbiota, and fecal metabolites in Pb-exposed mice. Oral administration of CCFM8661 + CS to Pb-exposed mice reduced Pb accumulation in the liver, kidney, and bone tissues (from 3.70, 14.11 and 121.20 mg g-1 wet tissue to 2.26, 8.72 and 65.57 mg g-1 wet tissue, respectively) and increased total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione in the liver and kidneys. Additionally, gut microbiome analysis showed that CCFM8661 + CS intervention attenuated Pb-induced perturbation in gut microbiota, altering the abundance of bacteria such as Faecalibaculum, Ruminococcaceae UCG 014, Anaerostipes, and Enterorhabdus. Untargeted metabolomics analyses showed that CCFM8661 + CS significantly increased cinnamoylglycine, hippuric acid, and equol (to 31.24, 28.77 and 20.13 times the baseline, respectively) and decreased guanine and 4-coumaric acid (0.30 and 0.09 times the baseline, respectively) in the feces, affecting pathways such as purine and amino acid metabolism. Further analyses showed that promoting Pb excretion and restoring the Pb-impaired gut microbiome and its metabolism may be important contributors to CCFM8661 + CS alleviation of Pb toxicity.",

      "abstract": "The use of nanotechnology and polymer-based carriers in osteoporosis treatment offers promising avenues for targeted drug delivery and enhanced therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we developed a novel nanoconjugate composed of Chitosan (CH), Chondroitin Sulfate (CS), and Daidzein (DZ) to treat glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in an in vivo zebrafish model. The CH-CS-DZ nanoconjugate were synthesized using the ionic gelation method, with a CH: CS ratio of 1:1 and a 3 % DZ concentration was identified as optimal for further analysis. The resulting nanoparticles exhibited a particle size of 401.2 ± 0.87 nm. The polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential of nanoconjugate were of 0.147 ± 0.04 and 43.55 ± 0.68 mV respectively. Drug release studies demonstrated that 79.66 ± 4.04 % of DZ was released under physiological conditions (pH 7.5) after 96 h, indicating a sustained release profile beneficial for prolonged therapeutic effects. In vivo, studies using zebrafish larvae revealed a significant reduction in oxidative stress and apoptosis in the CH-CS-DZ treated group compared to the glucorticoid dexamethasone (Dex) treated group. Specifically, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were reduced, and lipid peroxidation was markedly decreased (p < 0.001) in the CH-CS-DZ treated group. Additionally, the survival and hatching rates of CH-CS-DZ-treated larvae were 94 % and 95 %, respectively, significantly higher than those in the Dex-treated group. The CH-CS-DZ nanoconjugate also restored bone mineralization, as evidenced by a significant increase in calcium deposition (p < 0.001) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity (122 ± 0.4 U/L), compared to the Dex group (84 ± 0.7 U/L). Gene expression analysis showed upregulation of OPG and ALP and downregulation of RANKL and RUNX2b, further indicating the anti-osteoporotic potential of the CH-CS-DZ nanoconjugates. These findings suggest that polymer-based nanoconjugates like CH-CS-DZ can effectively mitigate osteoporosis through targeted delivery and sustained release, offering a potent strategy for bone health restoration."

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent degenerative arthritis disease linked to aging, obesity, diet, and accumulation of octacalcium phosphate (OCP) crystals in joints. Current research has focused on inflammation and chondrocytes apoptosis as underlying OA mechanisms. Inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β activate matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) and aggrecanase (the member of A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin motifs family, ADAMTS), leading to cartilage matrix degradation. The NLRP3 inflammasome also contributes to OA pathogenesis by maturing IL-1β. Natural products like chondroitin sulfate oligosaccharides (oligo-CS) show promise in OA treatment by inhibiting inflammation. Our study evaluates the protective effects of oligo-CS against OA by targeting NLRP3 inflammation. Stimulating human SW1353 chondrocytes and human mononuclear macrophage THP-1 cells with OCP showed increased NLRP3 inflammation initiation, NF-κB pathway activation, and the production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6) and the metabolic index (MMP-13, ADAMTS-5), leading to cartilage matrix degradation. However, oligo-CS treatment significantly reduced inflammation. In a 28-day in vivo study with C57BL/6 female mice, OCP was injected into their right knee and oligo-CS was orally administered. The OCP group exhibited significant joint space narrowing and chondrocyte loss, while the oligo-CS group maintained cartilage integrity. Oligo-CS groups also regulated gut microbiota composition to a healthier state. Taken together, our findings suggest that oligo-CS can be considered as a protective compound against OA.",

This study was prompted by the need to fill the gap between medical treatment and advanced therapies allowing improvement in Quality of Life. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the association between treatment type (Ialuril®; IBSA Farmaceutici, Lodi, Italy; in combination with antimuscarinic or alone after drop-out of antimuscarinic, relative to antimuscarinic alone treatment) and functional outcomes (number of micturitions, pelvic pain, urinary incontinence, nocturia, urgency). METHODS: Of all patients newly diagnosed (January 2016 - January 2022) with OAB syndrome, we retrospectively identified 150 patients. They harbored three groups of 50 patients each: group 1 (antimuscarinic drug), group 2 (antimuscarinic drug + hyaluronic acid-chondroitin sulphate [HA-CS]), group 3 (antimuscarinic dropout patients). Univariable linear and logistic regression models were fitted for number and rates of incontinence, urgency, pelvic pain, nocturia, respectively. RESULTS: A significant mean reduction of 1.5 micturition (P=0.02) was recorded in group 2 compared to group 1. Conversely, no statistically significant mean difference was recorded in group 3 compared to group 1. Regarding pelvic pain, both group 2 and group 3 were associated with lower rate of pelvic pain (P<0.001). Regarding urgency, a statistically significant protective OR was recorded for group 2 (OR=0.39; P=0.04), compared to group 1. CONCLUSIONS: The combination therapy was associated with symptom improvement in antimuscarinic naïve OAB patients. Conversely in antimuscarinic dropped-out patients only pelvic pain improved with the HS-CA. No statistically significant differences were recorded for other functional outcomes, such as incontinence and nocturia."

In this study, an effective Fenton-like system comprising trimetallic-doped carbon nitride material (tri-CN) with hydrogen-bonded melamine-cyanuric acid (MCA) supramolecular aggregates as its basic skeleton was engineered to overcome the challenges of traditional methods. Detailed material characterizations revealed that, compared to monometallic-doped or bimetallic-doped counterparts, tri-CN offered a larger surface area, higher porosity, and increased metal loading, thereby enhancing reactant accessibility and polysaccharide degradation efficiency. The characterization and activity assessment of the degraded polysaccharide revealed structurally intact products without significant desulfurization, indicating the effectiveness of the designed approach. Moreover, the degraded chondroitin sulfate CS3 catalyzed by tri-CN, exhibited promising antioxidant activity and anti-CRISPR potential. The results elucidated that the high-valent iron species in the material served as primary active sites, catalyzing the cleavage of hydrogen peroxide to generate hydroxyl radicals that subsequently attacked CS chains, leading to their fragmentation. Hence, the designed material can be efficiently applied to polysaccharide degradation, but not limited to photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, sensor, energy storage materials, and wastewater treatment."

Despite its prevalence, current clinical therapy lacks effective antiviral agents. Fucosylated chondroitin sulfates (FCS) derived from sea cucumber exhibits a range of biological activities including potent antiviral effects. This study provides compelling evidence of the potent antiviral efficacy of FCS against EV71. To further elucidate the impact of structural variations on the anti-EV71 activity, native FCSs with diverse sulfation patterns and a varity of FCS derivatives were prepared and analyzed. Notably, this study presents the detailed structural characterization of FCSs from the sea cucumbers Holothuria scabra Jaege and Holothuria fuscopunctata. Analysis of the structure-activity relationships revealed that molecular weight, sulfated fucose branches, and sulfation pattern were all crucial factors contributing to the potent inhibitory effects of FCS against EV71. Interestingly, molecular weight emerged as the most significant structural determinant of the antiviral potency. These findings suggest the promising potential of utilizing FCS as an innovative EV71 entry inhibitor for the treatment of HFMD.",

Research indicates that condoliase, an enzyme used to degrade glycosaminoglycans in the nucleus pulposus, provides effective and prompt relief of leg pain, with significant reductions observed within a day of treatment. Studies reveal that a lower pretreatment straight leg raising (SLR) angle may predict early symptom relief, and condoliase is generally effective at doses up to 1.25 U, balancing efficacy and safety. Despite promising results, concerns about long-term safety, including disc height reduction and imaging changes, persist. Additionally, chondroitin sulfate ABC endolyase shows potential as a safer and more effective alternative, though further research is needed to optimize treatment protocols and assess long-term outcomes. Future investigations should address current limitations, such as small sample sizes and short follow-up periods, to better understand the long-term benefits and risks of these treatments.",

The glycosaminoglycan chondroitin sulfate exhibits properties of immunomodulation and tissue regeneration. In prior investigations, oxidized chondroitin sulfate (OCS) ameliorated the prognosis of FK in murine models. To further improve the curative efficacy, we used the antifungal drug natamycin to functionalize OCS and prepared oxidized chondroitin sulfate-natamycin (ON) eye drops. The structure of ON was characterized by FTIR, UV-vis, and XPS, revealing that the amino group of natamycin combined with the aldehyde group in OCS through Schiff base reaction. Antifungal experiments revealed that ON inhibited fungal growth and disrupted the mycelium structure. ON exhibited exceptional biocompatibility and promoted the proliferation of corneal epithelial cells. Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that ON enhanced drug utilization by extending the mean residence time in tears. In murine FK, ON treatment reduced the clinical score and corneal fungal load, restored corneal stroma conformation, and facilitated epithelial repair. ON effectively inhibited neutrophil infiltration and decreased the expression of TLR-4, LOX-1, IL-1β, and TNF-α. Our research demonstrated that ON eye drops achieved multifunctional treatment for FK, including inhibiting fungal growth, promoting corneal repair, enhancing drug bioavailability, and controlling inflammatory reactions.",

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is an aging-associated disease characterized by joint stiffness pain and destroyed articular cartilage. Traditional treatments for OA are limited to alleviating various OA symptoms. There is a lack of drugs available in clinical practice that can truly repair cartilage damage. Here, we developed the chondroitin sulfate analog CS-semi5, semi-synthesized from chondroitin sulfate A. In vivo, CS-semi5 alleviated inflammation, provided analgesic effects, and protected cartilage in the modified Hulth OA rat model and papain-induced OA rat model. A bioinformatics analysis was performed on samples from OA patients and an exosome analysis on papain-induced OA rats, revealing miR-122-5p as the key regulator associated with CS-semi5 in OA treatment. Binding prediction revealed that miR-122-5p acted on the 3'-untranslated region of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, which was related to MMP13 regulation. Subsequent in vitro experiments revealed that CS-semi5 effectively reduced cartilage degeneration and maintained matrix homeostasis by inhibiting matrix breakdown through the miR-122-5p/p38/MMP13 axis, which was further validated in the articular cartilage of OA rats. This is the first study to investigate the semi-synthesized chondroitin sulfate CS-semi5, revealing its cartilage-protecting, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic properties that show promising therapeutic effects in OA via the miR-122-5p/p38/MMP13 pathway."

Owing to their anti-inflammatory function, the hASC-EV-bearing cMN (EV@cMN) significantly suppressed activated fibroblast-like synoviocytes (aFLS) and M1 macrophages (M1), which are responsible for the progression of RA. In addition, EV@cMN facilitated the chondrogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived stem cells. In mice with collagen-induced arthritis, EV@cMN efficiently delivered both hASC-EV and CSC to inflamed joints. Interestingly, pro-inflammatory cytokines in the inflamed joints were remarkably downregulated by the synergistic effect of CSC and hASC-EV. Consequently, as judged from the overall clinical score and joint swelling, EV@cMN showed an outstanding therapeutic effect, even comparable to the wild-type mice, without significant adverse effects. Overall, EV@cMN might have therapeutic potential for RA by efficiently delivering CSC and hASC-EV into the inflamed joints in a non-invasive manner.",

For Col II and CS, the highest efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis was achieved after 24 and 6 h of treatment, respectively. The average molecular weights were α1 chain-130 kDa, β chain-270 kDa for Col II, and 80.27 kDa for CS. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that the Col II samples maintained their triple-helical structure and that the predominant type of CS was chondroitin-4-sulfate. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the Col II and CS samples possessed fibrillar and clustered structures, respectively.

One such embryonic signature tumors express is oncofetal chondroitin sulfate (ofCS), which supports disease progression and dissemination in cancer. Here, we report the identification and characterization of phage display-derived antibody fragments recognizing two distinct ofCS epitopes. These antibody fragments show binding affinity to ofCS in the low nanomolar range across a broad selection of solid tumor types in vitro and in vivo with minimal binding to normal, inflamed, or benign tumor tissues. Anti-ofCS antibody drug conjugates and bispecific immune cell engagers based on these targeting moieties disrupt tumor progression in animal models of human and murine cancers. Thus, anti-ofCS antibody fragments hold promise for the development of broadly effective therapeutic and diagnostic applications targeting human malignancies.",

      "abstract": "Pregnant women with chronic kidney disease (CKD) face increased risks of adverse outcomes in their adult offspring. Offspring rats born to dams fed an adenine diet develop hypertension, coinciding with dysregulated hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and nitric oxide (NO) pathways, as well as alterations in gut microbiota. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is a multifunctional food known for its diverse bioactivities. As a sulfate prebiotic, CS has shown therapeutic potential in various diseases. Here, we investigated the protective effects of maternal CS supplementation against hypertension in offspring induced by an adenine diet. Mother rats were administered regular chow, 0.5% adenine, 3% CS, or a combination throughout gestation and lactation. Maternal CS supplementation effectively protected offspring from hypertension induced by the adenine diet. These beneficial effects of CS were connected with increased renal mRNA and protein levels of 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase, an enzyme involved in H2S production. Furthermore, maternal CS treatment significantly enhanced alpha diversity and altered beta diversity of gut microbiota in adult offspring. Specifically, perinatal CS treatment promoted the abundance of beneficial microbes such as Roseburia hominis and Ruminococcus gauvreauii. In conclusion, perinatal CS treatment mitigates offspring hypertension associated with maternal adenine diet, suggesting that early administration of sulfate prebiotics may hold preventive potential. These findings warrant further translational research to explore their clinical implications."

Despite extensive research on HA and CS as drug delivery systems (DDS), their high water solubility limits their application as drug carriers. This study introduces an injectable DDS using aldehyde-modified hyaluronic acid (HAOX) hydrogel containing polyelectrolyte complexes (PEC) formed with calcium, gelatin, and either CS or aldehyde-modified CS (CSOX) to deliver minocycline for Multiple Sclerosis therapy. PECs with CSOX enable covalent crosslinking to HAOX, creating immobilized PECs (HAOX_PECOX), while those with CS remain unbound (HAOX_PECS). The in situ forming DDS can be administered via a 20 G needle, with rapid gelation preventing premature leakage. The system integrates into an implanted device for minocycline release through either Fickian or anomalous diffusion, depending on PEC immobilization. HAOX_PECOX reduced burst release by 88 %, with a duration of 127 h for 50 % release. The DDS exhibited an elastic modulus of 3800 Pa and a low swelling ratio (0-1 %), enabling precise control of minocycline release kinetics. Released minocycline reduced IL-6 secretion in the Whole Blood Monocytes Activation Test, suggesting that DDS formation may not alter the biological activity of the loaded drug.",

Nitric oxide (NO) is an endogenous signaling molecule that represents an attractive, simple therapeutic for chronic wound treatment due to its innate antibacterial and immunomodulatory function. Unfortunately, modulating inflammation for extended periods by low levels of NO is not possible with NO gas. Herein, we report the utility of a NO-releasing glycosaminoglycan biopolymer (GAG) for promoting wound healing. GAGs are naturally occurring biopolymers that are immunomodulatory and known to be involved in the native wound healing process. Thus, the combination of NO and GAG biopolymers represents an attractive wound therapeutic due to these known independent roles. The influence and contribution of chondroitin sulfate C (CSC) modified to facilitate controlled and targeted delivery of NO (CSC-HEDA/NO) was evaluated using in vitro cell proliferation and migration assays and an in vivo wound model.",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the action of CGS on the progression of chemically induced osteoarthritis in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) of rabbits by evaluating the serum levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α) and collagen in the articular discs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sample of 36 male rabbits was divided into three groups: control (CG), osteoarthritis (OG) and treatment (TG). The disease was induced by intra-articular injection of sodium monoiodoacetate (10 mg/mL) in the OG and TG groups bilaterally. After 10 days, the TG animals received subcutaneous injection of chondroitin sulphates and glucosamine (7.5 mg/kg) and the OG and CG received saline solution (50 μL). Euthanasia times were subdivided into 40 and 100 days. Collagen quantification was performed by biochemical and histological analysis and for the quantification of serum levels of TNF-α, an enzyme immunoassay was used. RESULTS: The TG showed an increase in the collagen area of the articular disc when compared to the CG and the OG. The increase collagen concentration in the discs did not show a statistically significant difference between the groups. Post-treatment TNF-α levels were significantly lower in TG compared to OG. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that CGS treatment delayed the degeneration of the collagen in the TMJ articular disc and reduced serum TNF-α levels, indicating a preventive effect on OA progression.",

However, Exos functionalization with targeting ligands is a critical step to enhance their targeting capability, which could be challenging. In this study, Exos were modified to specifically bind to CD44-positive cells by anchoring chondroitin sulfate (CS) to their surface. Exo modification was facilitated with CS conjugation with alpha-tocopherol succinate (TOS) as an anchorage. The modified Exos were utilized for delivering curcumin (Cur) to pancreatic cancer (PC) cells. In vitro Cur release studies revealed that Exos play a crucial role in maintaining Cur within themselves, demonstrating their potential as effective carriers for drug delivery to targeted locations. Notably, Cur loaded into the modified Exos exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity compared to unmodified Exo-Cur. Meanwhile, Exo-Cur-TOS-CS induced apoptosis more effectively in AsPC-1 cells than unmodified Exos (70.2 % versus 56.9 %). It is worth mentioning that with CD44-mediated cancer-specific targeting, Exo-CS enabled increased intracellular accumulation in AsPC-1 cells, showing promise as a targeted platform for cancer therapy. These results confirm that Exo modification has a positive impact on enhancing the therapeutic efficacy and cytotoxicity of drugs.",

The formation of the well-defined NPs was obtained at pH 4 with a hydrodynamic radius from 60 to 80 nm. NP aggregation was observed at pH 1.5 because of the loss of the anionic charge of chondroitin sulfate on the surface of the NPs. After thermal treatment, the NPs exhibited stability against a pH increase to pH 7 while a stronger aggregation at pH 1.5 was observed. Core-shell structures were found at pH 7 after thermal treatment, indicating a possible mechanism of partial disintegration. The addition of Tween 80 (T80) before thermal treatment led to the formation of T80 self-assemblies inside the NPs. This caused an increase in the hydrophobicity of the inner and outer surfaces of the NPs as it was observed by fluorescence spectroscopy. The ζ-potential of the complexes and NPs was about -20 mV while the presence of T80 did not affect it. FTIR spectra verified changes of the secondary structure of β-LG in its complexes with CS and T80. The thermally treated NPs exhibited high surface and overall hydrophobicity and stability in high salinity and biocompatible solutions. The thermally treated NPs showed colloidal and physicochemical stability for 1 month, which were enhanced by the addition of T80. Due to the nature of the precursors and their colloidal properties, the NPs are highly promising for applications as biocompatible drug delivery nanocarriers while T80 acts as an agent to modify their properties."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: One common and very upsetting side effect of burn injuries is scarring, which presents serious difficulties for patients and medical professionals alike. AIM: To assess a new therapeutic approach for treating scars following burn repair procedures in terms of its clinical efficacy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This method administers Hirudoid under ultrasound guidance in addition to fractional CO2 laser treatment. An extensive analysis of the effects of this combination treatment on functional results, patient satisfaction, and scar appearance is being conducted as part of this research. Fractional CO2 laser treatment is utilized for its capacity to stimulate collagen remodelling and decrease scar hypertrophy, while Hirudoid, a topical medicine containing heparinoid, is used to minimize inflammation and enhance tissue healing. Enrolling patients who have had burn repair surgery is the goal of a quasi-experimental study. Conventional scar care methods are performed on the control group, whereas the experimental group is treated with fractional CO2 laser therapy after applying Hirudoid under ultrasound guidance. Throughout the research period, clinical evaluations are carried out on a regular basis. These evaluations cover scar features, pain thresholds, and patient-reported results. RESULTS: The first findings show that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group in terms of overall look, pigmentation, and scar texture. Functional examinations point to possible improvements in terms of scar flexibility and the range of motion, while patient-reported outcomes show improved satisfaction with the combination therapy. In order to guarantee the combination therapy's viability and tolerance in a clinical context, its side effects and safety profiles are also extensively assessed. In order to improve scar management following burn healing, the study intends to provide important insights into the creation of more patient-friendly and successful therapies. CONCLUSIONS: A potential approach to enhancing the clinical results of burn scar treatment is the study of fractional CO2 laser therapy in conjunction with ultrasound-guided Hirudoid. Enhancing scar management tactics via the combination of sophisticated technology and therapy modalities may eventually improve the quality of life for burn injury victims."

      "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors, are the fourth most common therapeutic tool after surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, only a small proportion (≈5%) of CRC patients, those with \"hot\" (immuno-activated) tumors, benefit from the therapy. Pyroptosis, an innovative form of programmed cell death, is a potentially effective means to mediate a \"cold\" to \"hot\" transformation of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Calcium-releasing hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanoparticles (NPs) trigger calcium overload and pyroptosis in tumor cells. However, current limitations of these nanomedicines, such as poor tumor-targeting capabilities and insufficient calcium (Ca) ion release, limit their application. In this study, chondroitin sulfate (CS) is used to target tumors via binding to CD44 receptors and kaempferol (KAE) is used as a Ca homeostasis disruptor to construct CS-HAP@KAE NPs that function as pyroptosis inducers in CRC cells. CS-HAP@KAE NPs bind to the tumor cell membrane, HAP released Ca in response to the acidic environment of the TME, and kaempferol (KAE) enhances the influx of extracellular Ca, resulting in intracellular Ca overload and pyroptosis. This is associated with excessive endoplasmic reticulum stress triggered activation of the stimulator of interferon genes/interferon regulatory factor 3 pathway, ultimately transforming the TME from \"cold\" to \"hot\".",

      "abstract": "Osteochondral damage, affecting the articular cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone, presents significant challenges in clinical treatment. Such defects, commonly seen in knee and ankle joints, vary from small localized lesions to larger defects. Current medical therapies encounter several challenges, such as donor shortages, drug side effects, high costs, and rejection problems, often resulting in only temporary relief. Highly porous emulsion-templated polymers (polyHIPEs) offer numerous potential benefits in the fabrication of scaffolds for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Polymeric scaffolds synthesized using a high internal phase emulsion (HIPE) technique, called PolyHIPEs, involve polymerizing a continuous phase surrounding a dispersed internal phase to form a solid, foam-like structure. A dense, porous design encourages cell ingrowth, nutrient delivery, and waste disposal from the scaffold, mimicking the cells' natural microenvironment. This study used hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and acrylamide (AAM) polyHIPE scaffolds combined with extracellular matrix (ECM) components of the tissue, such as methacrylated hyaluronic acid (MHA) and methacrylated chondroitin sulfate (MCS), to prepare polyHIPE scaffolds. The mouse preosteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells and primary rat chondrocytes (harvested from male Wistar rats) were seeded on the scaffolds and cultured for 21 days to assess the osteogenesis and chondrogenesis in vitro. When compared to the AAM-MHA and AAM-MCS groups at day 21, scaffold groups HEMA-MHA and HEMA-MCS showed a significant rise in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and calcium content. Chondrogenic markers such as glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and hydroxyproline were also assessed over a 21-day time point. On day 21, it was found that GAG and hydroxyproline production were considerably higher in the HEMA-MHA and HEMA-MCS scaffolds than in the AAM-MHA and AAM-MCS scaffolds. The overall studies showed that polyHIPE monolith scaffolds could favor cell adherence, survival ability, proliferation, differentiation, and ECM formation over 21 days. Thus, incorporating ECM components enhanced osteogenesis and chondrogenesis in vitro and can be further used as tissue repair models.",

      "abstract": "Presently, the clinical treatment of intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) remains challenging, but the strategy of simultaneously overcoming the overactive inflammation and restoring the anabolic/catabolic balance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the nucleus pulposus (NP) has become an effective way to alleviate IVDD. IL-1ra, a natural antagonist against IL-1β, can mitigate inflammation and promote regeneration in IVDD. Chondroitin sulfate (CS), an important component of the NP, can promote ECM synthesis and delay IVDD. Thus, these were chosen and integrated into functionalized microspheres to achieve their synergistic effects. First, CS-functionalized microspheres (GelMA-CS) with porous microstructure, good monodispersion, and about 200 µm diameter were efficiently and productively fabricated using microfluidic technology. After lyophilization, the microspheres with good local injection and tissue retention served as the loading platform for IL-1ra and achieved sustained release. In in vitro experiments, the IL-1ra-loaded microspheres exhibited good cytocompatibility and efficacy in inhibiting the inflammatory response of NP cells induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and promoting the secretion of ECM. In in vivo experiments, the microspheres showed good histocompatibility, and local, minimally invasive injection of the IL-1ra-loaded microspheres could reduce inflammation, maintain the height of the intervertebral disc (IVD) and the water content of NP close to about 70 % in the sham group, and retain the integrated IVD structure. In summary, the GelMA-CS microspheres served as an effective loading platform for IL-1ra, eliminated inflammation through the controlled release of IL-1ra, and promoted ECM synthesis via CS to delay IVDD, thereby providing a promising intervention strategy for IVDD. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The strategy of simultaneously overcoming the overactive inflammation and restoring the anabolic/catabolic balance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in nucleus pulposus (NP) has shown great potential prospects for alleviating intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). From the perspective of clinical translation, this study developed chondroitin sulfate functionalized microspheres to act as the effective delivery platform of IL-1ra, a natural antagonist of interleukin-1β. The IL-1ra loading microspheres (GelMA-CS-IL-1ra) showed good biocompatibility, good injection with tissue retention, and synergistic effects of inhibiting the inflammatory response induced by lipopolysaccharide and promoting the secretion of ECM in NPCs. In vivo, they also showed the beneficial effect of reducing the inflammatory response, maintaining the height of the intervertebral disc and the water content of the NP, and preserving the integrity of the intervertebral disc structure after only one injection. All demonstrated that the GelMA-CS-IL-1ra microspheres would have great promise for the minimally invasive treatment of IVDD.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: In a previous study, we found that oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) YW002 could induce the activity of alkaline phosphatase of early osteogenesis in human periodontal membrane stem cells, and downregulate the synthesis of nitric oxide in RAW 264.7 cells in the late inflammatory stage, laying the experimental foundation for the subsequent application of ODN YW002 in periodontitis. However, free ODN does not easily adhere to cells and is easily hydrolyzed by nuclease, so the immune effect of ODN is greatly reduced. Therefore, the nano-drug delivery system provides a method for efficient delivery and uptake of ODN. METHODS: We synthesized a polyethyleneimine (PEI) modified chondroitin sulfate (CS) derivative (PEI-CS) via Michael addition to deliver ODN YW002. We aimed to evaluate whether PEI-CS could effectively deliver YW002 to RAW 264.7 cells and if it can regulate inflammation in vitro. PEI-CS/YW002 nanocomplexes were locally injected into a mouse periodontitis model, and the therapeutic effects were evaluated by microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) and hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. RESULTS: The results indicated that PEI-CS had good biocompatibility and could form a stable nanocomplex with YW002 at a mass ratio of 4 : 1. Moreover, PEI-CS could deliver YW002 into RAW 246.7 cells and markedly decreased the expression levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Histological evaluation and micro-CT scanning showed that PEI-CS/YW002 nanocomplexes effectively inhibited periodontitis and reduced alveolar bone resorption in mice. CONCLUSION: Our study has underscored the potential of PEI-CS/YW002 nanocomplexes as promising agents for the prevention and treatment of periodontitis due to their potent anti-inflammatory effects."

Fabricated materials, composed of methacrylated gelatin, chitosan, and chondroitin sulfate, possess interesting features including bioactivity, biocompatibility, as well as antibacterial activity. Importantly, their degradation and swellability might be easily tuned by playing with the biopolymeric content in the photocrosllinked systems. To broaden the potential application and deliver the therapeutic features, mesoporous silica particles functionalized with methacrylate moieties decorated with hydroxyapatite and loaded with the antiosteoporotic drug, alendronate, (MSP-MA-HAp-ALN) were dispersed within the biopolymeric sol and photocrosslinked. It was demonstrated that the obtained composites are characterized by a significantly extended degradation time, ensuring optimal conditions for balancing hybrids removal with the deposition of fresh bone. We have shown that attachment of MSP-MA-HAp-ALN to the polymeric matrix minimizes the initial burst effect and provides a prolonged release of ALN (up to 22 days). Moreover, the biological evaluation in vitro suggested the capability of the resulted systems to promote bone remodeling. Developed materials might potentially serve as scaffolds that after implantation will fill up bone defects of various origin (osteoporosis, tumour resection, accidents) providing the favourable conditions for bone regeneration and supporting the infections' treatment.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the anti-cervical cancer activity of chondroitin sulfate-functionalized selenium nanoparticles (SeCS) and to elucidate their action mechanism. Cytotoxic effect of SeCS on HeLa cells was assessed by MTT assay. Further molecular mechanism of SeCS was analyzed by flow cytometric assay and western blotting. The results showed that treatment with SeCS resulted in a dose- and time-dependent inhibition in the proliferation of HeLa cells. The data obtained from flow cytometry demonstrated that SeCS inhibited HeLa cell growth via the induction of S-phase arrest and cell apoptosis. Further mechanism analysis found that SeCS down-regulated expression levels of cyclin A and CDK2 and up-regulated p21 expression, which contributed to S arrest. Moreover, SeCS increased the level of Bax and decreased the expression of Bcl-2, resulting in the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria and activating caspase-3/8/9 for caspase-dependent apoptosis. Meanwhile, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were elevated after SeCS treatment, suggesting that ROS might be upstream of SeCS-induced S-phase arrest and cell apoptosis. These data show that SeCS has anti-tumor effects and possesses the potential to become a new therapeutic agent or adjuvant therapy for cancer patients. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: In our previous study, we used chondroitin sulfate to stabilize nano-selenium to obtain SeCS to improve the bioactivity and stability of nano-selenium. We found that it possessed an inhibitory effect on HeLa cells. However, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. This study elucidated the mechanism of SeCS damage to HeLa cells.

As natural sulfated polysaccharides have high molecular weight, high apparent viscosity, low water solubility, complex structure, and high negative charge, they have difficulty binding to receptors within cells across tissue barriers, resulting in low bioavailability and unclear structure-activity relationships. In this study, an H2O2-Vc oxidative degradation system was employed to perform environmentally friendly and controllable degradation of CS extracted from the nasal cartilage of Shaanxi Yellow cattle. Two low-molecular-weight chondroitin sulfates (LMWCSs), CS-1 (14.8 kDa) and CS-2 (50.9 kDa), that exhibit strong in vitro free radical scavenging ability were obtained, and their structures were characterized. Mice intraperitoneally administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used to explore the cognitive intervention effects of LMWCS. Supplementing CS-1 and CS-2 significantly downregulated the levels of the serum inflammatory factors, TNF-α and IL-1β, promoted the expression of GSH in the brain, and inhibited the production of the lipid peroxidation product, malondialdehyde (MDA), ultimately inhibiting LPS-induced cognitive impairment in mice. Surprisingly, compared to the LPS model group, the abundances of Streptococcus, Eisenbergiella, Vampirovibrio, Coprococcus, Enterococcus and Lachnoanaerobaculum were significantly increased in the intestines of mice in the CS-1 and CS-2 group, whereas those of Parabacteroides and Mycoplasma were significantly decreased. Altogether, this study provides a theoretical basis for the comprehensive utilization of agricultural and animal resources and the application of brain nutrition, anti-inflammatory, and LMWCS health products."

      "abstract": "In this study, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) were extracted from corb (Sciaena umbra) heads and thoroughly examined for their structure. Through cellulose acetate electrophoresis, the GAGs were identified as chondroitin sulfate (CS), with a recovery yield of 10.35 %. The CS exhibited notable characteristics including a high sulfate content (12.4 %) and an average molecular weight of 38.32 kDa. Further analysis via 1H NMR spectroscopy and SAX-HPLC revealed that the CS primarily consisted of alternating units predominantly composed of monosulfated disaccharides at positions 6 and 4 of GalNAc (52.6 % and 38.8 %, respectively). The ratio of sulfate groups between positions 4 and 6 of GalNAc (4/6 ratio) was approximately 0.74, resulting in an overall charge density of 0.98. Thermal properties of the CS were assessed using techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. Notably, the CS demonstrated concentration-dependent prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and thrombin time (TT) while showing no effect on platelet function. At 200 μg/mL, aPTT and TT coagulation times were 1.4 and 3.7 times faster than the control, respectively. These findings suggest that CS derived from corb heads holds promise as an anticoagulant agent for therapy, although further clinical investigations are necessary to validate its efficacy.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 70 patients with stages I-III of primary knee OA were randomized into 2 groups. Participants in the 1st (n=35) took AN 1 caps/day, in the 2nd (n=35) GC according to the standard regimen. After 7, 30, 90, 180 days, the Lequesne index (severity of OA), pain when moving according to VAS, WOMAC score were assessed, after 1, 3, 6 months - quality of life SF-36 and morning stiffness, after 6 months - MRI with T2 mapping, laboratory safety indicators. RESULTS: Over the course of 6 months of use, an improvement in the WOMAC index and a decrease in pain were observed without intergroup differences, and a greater decrease in stiffness in the AN group. After 3 months, the severity of OA decreased from moderate to mild in the AN group and was significantly lower compared to the GC group; quality of life (physical component of SF-36) was higher in the AN group. After 6 months, there was an improvement in cartilage ultrastructure (T2 relaxation time) in both groups and a more pronounced reduction of the synovitis area (MRI) in the AN group (2.95 and 1.37 times in the AN and GC group, respectively). There were no clinically significant adverse reactions observed in both groups. CONCLUSION: The use of AN in patients with stage I-III primary knee OA was not inferior in efficacy to the combination of GC. Further studies with greater statistical power (sample size) and follow-up period are warranted including in real clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a highly prevalent malignancy affecting the digestive system on a global scale. This study aimed to explore the previously unexplored role of CHPF in the progression of CRC. Our results revealed a significant upregulation of CHPF expression in CRC tumour tissues compared to normal tissues, with its levels correlating with tumour malignancy. In vitro experiments using CRC cell lines demonstrated that inhibiting CHPF expression suppressed cell proliferation, colony formation and cell migration, while promoting apoptosis. Conversely, overexpressing CHPF had the opposite effect. Additionally, our xenograft models in mice confirmed the inhibitory impact of CHPF knockdown on CRC progression using various cell models. Mechanistic investigations unveiled that CHPF may enhance VEGFB expression through E2F1-mediated transcription. Functionally, suppressing VEGFB expression successfully mitigated the oncogenic effects induced by CHPF overexpression. Collectively, these findings suggest that CHPF may act as a tumour promoter in CRC, operating in a VEGFB-dependent manner and could be a potential target for therapeutic interventions in CRC treatment.",

      "abstract": "Blocking the tumor nutrient supply through angiogenic inhibitors is an effective treatment approach for malignant tumors. However, using angiogenic inhibitors alone may not be enough to achieve a significant tumor response. Therefore, we recently designed a universal drug delivery system combining chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic therapy to target tumor cells while minimizing drug-related side effects. This system (termed as PCCE) is composed of biomaterial chondroitin sulfate (CS), the anti-angiogenic peptide ES2, and paclitaxel (PTX), which collectively enhance antitumor properties. Interestingly, the PCCE system is conferred exceptional cell membrane permeability due to inherent characteristics of CS, including CD44 receptor-mediated endocytosis. The PCCE could respond to the acidic and high glutathione conditions, thereby releasing PTX and ES2. PCCE could effectively inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of tumor cells and cause apoptosis, while PCCE can affect the endothelial cells tube formation and exert anti-angiogenic function. Consistently, more potent in vivo antitumor efficacy and non-toxic sides were demonstrated in B16F10 xenograft mouse models. PCCE can achieve excellent antitumor activity via modulating angiogenic and apoptosis-related factors. In summary, we have successfully developed an intelligent and responsive CS-based nanocarrier known as PCCE for delivering various antitumor drugs, offering a promising strategy for treating malignant tumors.",

      "abstract": "Accumulation of abnormal chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains in breast cancer tissue is correlated with poor prognosis. However, the biological functions of these CS chains in cancer progression remain largely unknown, impeding the development of targeted treatment focused on CS. Previous studies identified chondroitin polymerizing factor (CHPF; also known as chondroitin sulfate synthase 2) is the critical enzyme regulating CS accumulation in breast cancer tissue. We then assessed the association between CHPF-associated proteoglycans (PGs) and signaling pathways in breast cancer datasets. The regulation between CHPF and syndecan 1 (SDC1) was examined at both the protein and RNA levels. Confocal microscopy and image flow cytometry were employed to quantify macropinocytosis. The effects of the 6-O-sulfated CS-binding peptide (C6S-p) on blocking CS functions were tested in vitro and in vivo. Results indicated that the expression of CHPF and SDC1 was tightly associated within primary breast cancer tissue, and high expression of both genes exacerbated patient prognosis. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling was implicated in the regulation of CHPF and SDC1 in breast cancer cells. CHPF supported CS-SDC1 stabilization on the cell surface, modulating macropinocytotic activity in breast cancer cells under nutrient-deprived conditions. Furthermore, C6S-p demonstrated the ability to bind CS-SDC1, increase SDC1 degradation, suppress macropinocytosis of breast cancer cells, and inhibit tumor growth in vivo. Although other PGs may also be involved in CHPF-regulated breast cancer malignancy, this study provides the first evidence that a CS synthase participates in the regulation of macropinocytosis in cancer cells by supporting SDC1 expression on cancer cells.",

In this study, we designed chondroitin sulfate (CS)-modified tragacanth gum-gelatin composite nanocapsules (CS-Cur-TGNCs) loaded with curcumin nanocrystals (Cur-NCs), which rely on the ability of CS to target CD44 to accumulate drugs in inflamed joints. Cur was encapsulated in the form of nanocrystals into tragacanth gum-gelatin composite nanocapsules (TGNCs) by using an inborn microcrystallization method, which produced CS-Cur-TGNCs with a particle size of approximately 80 ± 11.54 nm and a drug loading capacity of 54.18 ± 5.17%. In an in vitro drug release assay, CS-Cur-TGNCs showed MMP-2-responsive properties. During the treatment of RA, CS-Cur-TGNCs significantly inhibited oxidative stress, promoted the polarization of M2-type macrophages to M1-type macrophages, and decreased the expression of inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6). In addition, it also exerted excellent anti-inflammatory effects, and significantly alleviated the swelling of joints during the treatment of gouty arthritis (GA). Therefore, CS-Cur-TGNCs, as a novel drug delivery system, could lead to new ideas for clinical therapeutic regimens for RA and GA.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: To assess the alterations in cell-specific DNA methylation associated with chondroitin sulphate response using peripheral blood collected from Kashin-Beck disease (KBD) patients before initiation of chondroitin sulphate treatment. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from KBD patients at baseline of chondroitin sulphate treatment. Methylation profiles were generated using reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS) from peripheral blood. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified using MethylKit, while DMR-related genes were defined as those annotated to the gene body or 2.2-kilobase upstream regions of DMRs. Selected DMR-related genes were further validated by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to assess expression levels. Tensor composition analysis was performed to identify cell-specific differential DNA methylation from bulk tissue. RESULTS: This study revealed 21,060 hypermethylated and 44,472 hypomethylated DMRs, and 13,194 hypermethylated and 22,448 hypomethylated CpG islands for differential global methylation for chondroitin sulphate treatment response. A total of 12,666 DMR-related genes containing DMRs were identified in their promoter regions, such as CHL1 (false discovery rate (FDR) = 2.11 × 10-11), RIC8A (FDR = 7.05 × 10-4), and SOX12 (FDR = 1.43 × 10-3). Additionally, RIC8A and CHL1 were hypermethylated in responders, while SOX12 was hypomethylated in responders, all showing decreased gene expression. The patterns of cell-specific differential global methylation associated with chondroitin sulphate response were observed. Specifically, we found that DMRs located in TESPA1 and ATP11A exhibited differential DNA methylation between responders and non-responders in granulocytes, monocytes, and B cells. CONCLUSION: Our study identified cell-specific changes in DNA methylation associated with chondroitin sulphate response in KBD patients."

      "abstract": "Multifunctional molecules involved in tumor progression and metastasis have been identified as valuable targets for immunotherapy. Among these, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4), a significant tumor cell membrane-bound proteoglycan, has emerged as a promising target, especially in light of advances in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. The profound bioactivity of CSPG4 and its role in pivotal processes such as tumor proliferation, migration, and neoangiogenesis underline its therapeutic potential. We reviewed the molecular intricacies of CSPG4, its functional attributes within tumor cells, and the latest clinical-translational advances targeting it. Strategies such as blocking monoclonal antibodies, conjugate therapies, bispecific antibodies, small-molecule inhibitors, CAR T-cell therapies, trispecific killer engagers, and ribonucleic acid vaccines against CSPG4 were assessed. CSPG4 overexpression in diverse tumors and its correlation with adverse prognostic outcomes emphasize its significance in cancer biology. These findings suggest that targeting CSPG4 offers a promising avenue for future cancer therapy, with potential synergistic effects when combined with existing treatments.",

AIM: To investigate the efficacy of an oral preparation of HA, chondroitin sulfate, N-acetylglucosamine, and vitamin C in improving sexual and urinary symptoms in a cohort of reproductive-age participants with rUTI. METHODS: In a monocentric randomized crossover pilot trial, participants with rUTI who were referred to our institute between March 2022 and April 2023 were randomized 1:1 in 2 groups: intervention vs control. All participants had an oral preparation of cranberry, D-mannose, propolis extract, turmeric, and Boswellia twice a day for 3 months. The intervention group also included an oral preparation of HA, chondroitin sulfate, N-acetylglucosamine, and vitamin C once a day for 3 months. Crossover of treatment occurred at 3 months for an additional 3 months. At baseline and 3 and 6 months, participants were evaluated clinically and with the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models tested the impact of the intervention on urinary and sexual symptoms at each follow-up assessment. OUTCOMES: Improvement in sexual and urinary symptoms as measured by the FSFI and IPSS. RESULTS: Overall, 27 (54%) participants had an FSFI score <26.5 at enrollment. At 3 months, FSFI scores were higher in the intervention group vs control (P < .001), but IPSS scores were lower (P = .03). After crossover of treatment, FSFI and IPSS scores remained stable in the intervention group. However, after crossover, the control group showed a significant improvement in IPSS and FSFI scores (all P < .01) vs the 3-month assessment. At last follow-up, urinary and sexual symptoms were comparable between groups. In logistic regression analyses, the intervention group was associated with early improvement in sexual symptoms (odds ratio, 3.9; P = .04) and urinary symptoms (odds ratio, 5.1; P = .01) after accounting for clinical confounders. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Combination treatment with HA, chondroitin sulfate, N-acetylglucosamine, and vitamin C is effective if started immediately or even after a few months from symptoms in participants with rUTI. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: The main limitation is the lack of long-term follow-up. CONCLUSION: The oral formulation of HA, chondroitin sulfate, N-acetylglucosamine, and vitamin C could be an effective therapy against urinary and sexual distress in participants with rUTI (NCT06268483; ClinicalTrials.gov).",

Enzymatic synthesis of CS for instance CSA has been considered as one of the most promising methods. However, the bottleneck consistently encountered is the active expression of chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferase (C4ST) during CSA biosynthesis. This study meticulously delved into optimizing C4ST expression through systematic enhancements in transcription, translation, and secretion mechanisms via modifications in the 5' untranslated region, the N-terminal encoding sequence, and the Komagataella phaffii chassis. Ultimately, the active C4ST expression escalated to 2713.1 U/L, representing a striking 43.7-fold increase. By applying the culture broth supernatant of C4ST and integrating the 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) biosynthesis module, we constructed a one-pot enzymatic system for CSA biosynthesis, achieving a remarkable sulfonation degree of up to 97.0 %. The substantial enhancement in C4ST expression and the development of an engineered one-pot enzymatic synthesis system promises to expedite large-scale CSA biosynthesis with customizable sulfonation degrees.",

      "abstract": "Atherosclerosis (AS) is characterized by the accumulation of substantial low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and inflammatory response. Hemoperfusion is commonly employed for the selective removal of LDL from the body. However, conventional hemoperfusion merely focuses on LDL removal and does not address the symptom of plaque associated with AS. Based on the LDL binding properties of acrylated chondroitin sodium sulfate (CSA), acrylated beta-cyclodextrin (CD) and acrylic acid (AA), along with the anti-inflammatory property of rosiglitazone (R), the fabricated AA-CSA-CD-R microspheres could simultaneously release R and facilitate LDL removal for hemoperfusion. The AA and CSA offer electrostatic adsorption sites for LDL, while the CD provides hydrophobic adsorption sites for LDL and weak binding sites for R. According to the Sips model, the maximum static LDL adsorption capacity of AA-CSA-CD-R is determined to be 614.73 mg/g. In dynamic simulated perfusion experiments, AA-CSA-CD-R exhibits an initial cycle LDL adsorption capacity of 150.97 mg/g. The study suggests that the weakened inflammatory response favors plaque stabilization. The anti-inflammatory property of the microspheres is verified through an inflammation model, wherein the microsphere extracts are cocultured with mouse macrophages. Both qualitative analysis of iNOS\\TNF-α and quantitative analysis of IL-6\\TNF-α collectively demonstrate the remarkable anti-inflammatory effect of the microspheres. Therefore, the current study presents a novel blood purification treatment of eliminating pathogenic factors and introducing therapeutic factors to stabilize AS plaque.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of fatality and disability worldwide. From minutes to months following damage, injury can result in a complex pathophysiology that can lead to temporary or permanent deficits including an array of neurodegenerative symptoms. These changes can include behavioral dysregulation, memory dysfunctions, and mood changes including depression. The nature and severity of impairments resulting from TBIs vary widely given the range of injury type, location, and extent of brain tissue involved. In response to the injury, the brain induces structural and functional changes to promote repair and minimize injury size. Despite its high prevalence, effective treatment strategies for TBI are limited. PNNs are part of the neuronal extracellular matrix (ECM) that mediate synaptic stabilization in the adult brain and thus neuroplasticity. They are associated mostly with inhibitory GABAergic interneurons and are thought to be responsible for maintaining the excitatory/inhibitory balance of the brain. The major structural components of PNNs include multiple chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) as well as other structural proteins. Here we examine the effects of injury on CSPG expression, specifically around the changes in the side change moieties. To investigate CSPG expression following injury, adult male and female zebra finches received either a bilateral penetrating, or no injury and qPCR analysis and immunohistochemistry for components of the CSPGs were examined at 1- or 7-days post-injury. Next, to determine if CSPGs and thus PNNs should be a target for therapeutic intervention, CSPG side chains were degraded at the time of injury with chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) CSPGs moieties were examined. Additionally, GABA receptor mRNA and aromatase mRNA expression was quantified following CSPG degradation as they have been implicated in neuronal survival and neurogenesis. Our data indicate the CSPG moieties change following injury, potentially allowing for a brief period of synaptic reorganization, and that treatments that target CSPG side chains are successful in further targeting this brief critical period by decreasing GABA mRNA receptor expression, but also decreasing aromatase expression.",

      "abstract": "Chondroitin sulphates (CSs) are the most well-known glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) found in any living organism, from microorganisms to invertebrates and vertebrates (including humans), and provide several health benefits. The applications of CSs are numerous including tissue engineering, osteoarthritis treatment, antiviral, cosmetics, and skincare applications. The current commercial production of CSs mostly uses animal, bovine, porcine, and avian tissues as well as marine organisms, marine mammals, sharks, and other fish. The production process consists of tissue hydrolysis, protein removal, and purification using various methods. Mostly, these are chemical-dependent and are complex, multi-step processes. There is a developing trend for abandonment of harsh extraction chemicals and their substitution with different green-extraction technologies, however, these are still in their infancy. The quality of CSs is the first and foremost requirement for end-applications and is dependent on the extraction and purification methodologies used. The final products will show different bio-functional properties, depending on their origin and production methodology. This is a comprehensive review of the characteristics, properties, uses, sources, and extraction methods of CSs. This review emphasises the need for extraction and purification processes to be environmentally friendly and gentle, followed by product analysis and quality control to ensure the expected bioactivity of CSs.",

      "abstract": "Nano-MoS2 exhibit oxidoreductase-like activities, and has been shown to effectively eliminate excessive intracellular ROS and inhibit Aβ aggregation, thus demonstrating promising potential for anti-Alzheimer's disease (anti-AD) intervention. However, the low water dispersibility and high toxicity of nano-MoS2 limits its further application. In this study, we developed a chondroitin sulphate (CS)-modified MoS2 nanoenzyme (CS@MoS2) by harnessing the excellent biocompatibility of CS and the exceptional activities of nano-MoS2 to explore its potential in anti-AD research. Promisingly, CS@MoS2 significantly inhibited Aβ1-40 aggregation and prevented toxic injury in SH-SY5Y cells caused by Aβ1-40. In addition, CS@MoS2 protected these cells from oxidative stress damage by regulating ROS production, as well as promoting the activities of SOD and GSH-Px. CS@MoS2 also modulated the intracellular Ca2+ imbalance and downregulated Tau hyperphosphorylation by activating GSK-3β. CS@MoS2 suppressed p-NF-κB (p65) translocation to the nucleus by inhibiting MAPK phosphorylation, and modulated the expression of downstream anti- and proinflammatory cytokines. Owing to its multifunctional activities, CS@MoS2 effectively improved spatial learning, memory, and anxiety in D-gal/AlCl3-induced AD mice. Taken together, these results indicate that CS@MoS2 has significant potential for improving the therapeutic efficacy of the prevention and treatment of AD, while also presenting a novel framework for the application of nanoenzymes.",

      "abstract": "AIM: This study was aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of two oral Symptomatic Slow Acting Drugs for Osteoarthritis (SYSADOAs)-Glucosamine Sulfate, Chondroitin Sulfate, and their combination regimen in the management of knee osteoarthritis (KOA). METHODS: This systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA 2020 guidelines. A detailed literature search was performed from 03/1994 to 31/12/2022 using various electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar, using the search terms-Glucosamine sulfate (GS), Chondroitin sulfate (CS), Knee osteoarthritis, Joint pain, Joint disease, and Joint structure, for literature concerning glucosamine, chondroitin, and their combination in knee osteoarthritis treatment. Cochrane Collaboration's Risk assessment tool (version 5.4.1) was used for assessing the risk of bias and the quality of the literature. The data was extracted from the included studies and subjected to statistical analysis to determine the beneficial effect of Glucosamine Sulfate, Chondroitin Sulfate, and their combination. RESULTS: Twenty-five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this systematic review. In short, exclusively 9 RCTs for GS, 13 RCTs for CS, and 3 RCTs for the combination of GS and CS. All these studies had their treatment groups compared with placebo. In the meta-analysis, CS showed a significant reduction in pain intensity, and improved physical function compared to the placebo; GS showed a significant reduction in tibiofemoral joint space narrowing. While the combination of GS and CS showed neither a reduction in pain intensity, nor any improvement in the physical function. However, the combination exhibited a non-significant reduction in joint space narrowing. In the safety evaluation, both CS and GS have shown good safety profile and were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis revealed that the CS (with decreased pain intensity and improvement in the physical function), and GS (with significant reduction in the joint space narrowing) have significant therapeutic benefits. However, their combination did not significantly improve the symptoms or modify the disease. This may be due to the limited trials that are available on the combination of the sulfate forms of the intervention. Hence, there is a scope for conducting multicentric randomised controlled trials to evaluate and conclude the therapeutic role of CS and GS combination in the management of KOA.",

In this study, a versatile hydrogel dressing with antibacterial and angiogenic activity composite of silk fibroin (SF), chondroitin sulfate (CS), and graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs) is fabricated. GOQDs@SF/CS (GSC) hydrogel is rapidly formed through the enzyme catalytic action of horseradish peroxidase. With the incorporation of GOQDs both gelation speed and mechanical properties have been enhanced, and the photothermal characteristics of GOQDs in GSC hydrogel enabled bacterial killing through photothermal treatment (PTT) at ∼51 °C. In vitro studies show that the GSC hydrogels demonstrate excellent antibacterial performance and induce type H vessel differentiation of endothelial cells via the activated ERK1/2 signaling pathway and upregulated SLIT3 expression. In vivo results show that the hydrogel significantly promotes type H vessels formation, which is related to the collagen deposition, epithelialization and, ultimately, accelerates the regeneration of infected skin defects. Collectively, this multifunctional GSC hydrogel, with dual action of antibacterial efficacy and angiogenesis promotion, emerges as an innovative skin dressing with the potential for advancing in infected wound healing.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Immunotherapies for cancers of epithelial origin have limited efficacy, and a growing body of evidence links the composition of extracellular matrix (ECM) with the likelihood of a favorable response to treatment. The ECM may be considered an immunologic barrier, restricting the localization of cytotoxic immune cells to stromal areas and inhibiting their contact with tumor cells. Identifying ECM components of this immunologic barrier could provide targets that whether degraded in situ may support antitumor immunity and improve immunotherapy response. Using a library of primary triple-negative breast cancer tissues, we correlated CD8+ T-cell tumor contact with ECM composition and identified a proteoglycan, versican (VCAN), as a putative member of the immunologic barrier. Our analysis reveals that CD8+ T-cell contact with tumor associates with the location of VCAN expression, the specific glycovariant of VCAN [defined through the pattern of posttranslational attachments of glycosaminoglycans (GAG)], and the cell types that produce the variant. In functional studies, the isomers of chondroitin sulfate presented on VCAN have opposing roles being either supportive or inhibiting of T-cell trafficking, and removal of the GAGs ameliorates these effects on T-cell trafficking. Overall, we conclude that VCAN can either support or inhibit T-cell trafficking within the tumor microenvironment depending on the pattern of GAGs present, and that VCAN is a major component of the ECM immunologic barrier that defines the type of response to immunotherapy. SIGNIFICANCE: The response to immunotherapy has been poor toward solid tumors despite immune cells infiltrating into the tumor. The ECM has been associated with impacting T-cell infiltration toward the tumor and in this article we have identified VCAN and its structural modification, chondroitin sulfate as having a key role in T-cell invasion.",

The DOX loaded LCPs was prepared by the self-assembly of two chondroitin sulphate (CS) derivatives, obtained by the covalent conjugation of Lipoic Acid (LA) and Chlorambucil (Chl) to the CS backbone. After the physic-chemical characterization of the conjugates by FT-IR, 1H NMR, and determination of the critical aggregation concentration, spherical nanoparticles with mean hydrodynamic diameter of 45 nm (P.D.I. 0.24) and Z-potential of - 44 mV were obtained by water addition/solvent evaporation method. In vitro experiments for the release of Chl and DOX were performed in healthy and cancer cells, using a cell culture media to maintain the physiological intracellular conditions (pH 7.4) (and concentration of esterase and GSH. The results allowed the selective release of the payloads to be detected: Chl release of 0 and 41% were obtained after 2 h incubation in normal and in cancer cells respectively, while values of 35 (in healthy cells) and 60% (in cancer cells) were recorded for DOX release after 96 h. Finally, viability studies proved the ability of the newly proposed nanosystem to enhance the cytotoxic activity of the two drugs against cancer cells."

Herein, we developed multifunctional nanoparticles based on chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) for the targeted delivery of chlorin e6 (Ce6) and doxorubicin (DOX), in a combined chemo-photodynamic therapy against triple-negative breast cancer. CSA was chosen for its hydrophilic properties and its affinity to CD44 receptor-overexpressed tumor cells. The CSA-ss-Ce6 (CSSC) conjugate was synthesized utilizing a disulfide linker. Subsequently, DOX-loaded CSSC (CSSC-D) nanoparticles were fabricated, showcasing a nearly spherical shape with an average particle size of 267 nm. In the CSSC-D nanoparticles, the chemically attached Ce6 constituted 1.53 %, while the physically encapsulated DOX accounted for 8.11 %. Both CSSC-D and CSSC nanoparticles demonstrated a reduction-sensitive release of DOX or Ce6 in vitro. Under near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation, CSSC-D showed the enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), improving cytotoxic effects against triple-negative breast cancer 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Remarkably, the CSSC-D with NIR exhibited the most potent tumor growth inhibition in comparison to other groups in the 4T1-bearing Balb/c mice model. Overall, this CSSC-D nanoplatform shows significant promise as a powerful tool for a synergetic approach in chemo-photodynamic therapy in triple-negative breast cancer.",

Inhibiting angiogenesis associated with tumors emerges as a potent therapeutic approach.

In this work, we further evaluated the stability in vitro, cellular uptake mechanism, cell apoptosis mechanism, antitumor activity in vivo, and safety of CS-EA. The stability of CS-EA was consistently superior to that of EA at different temperatures and in different pH ranges. Furthermore, CS-EA mainly entered EAhy926 cells through the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway. CS-EA inhibited endothelial cell proliferation, and induced cell apoptosis through downregulating the Bcl-2, reducing mitochondria membrane potential, upregulating cytochrome c, Caspase 3, and reactive oxygen species levels. CS-EA showed better antitumor activity in the B16 xenografted tumor model, with a tumor inhibition rate 1.92 times higher than EA. Simultaneously, it was observed that CS-EA did not cause any harmful effects on the vital organs of the mice. These findings indicate that CS-EA holds significant promise for the treatment of tumors.",

      "abstract": "Chondroitin sulfate (CS) has widely been used as a symptomatic slow-acting drug or a dietary supplement for the treatment and prevention of osteoarthritis. However, CS could not be absorbed after oral intake due to its polyanionic nature and large molecular weight. Gut microbiota has recently been proposed to play a pivotal role in the metabolism of drugs and nutrients. Nonetheless, how CS is degraded by the human gut microbiota has not been fully characterized. In the present study, we demonstrated that each human gut microbiota was characterized with a unique capability for CS degradation. Degradation and fermentation of CS by the human gut microbiota produced significant amounts of unsaturated CS oligosaccharides (CSOSs) and short-chain fatty acids. To uncover which microbes were responsible for CS degradation, we isolated a total of 586 bacterial strains with a potential CS-degrading capability from 23 human fecal samples. Bacteroides salyersiae was a potent species for CS degradation in the human gut microbiota and produced the highest amount of CSOSs as compared to other well-recognized CS-degraders, including Bacteroides finegoldii, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides xylanisolvens, and Bacteroides ovatus. Genomic analysis suggested that B. salyersiae was armed with multiple carbohydrate-active enzymes that could potentially degrade CS into CSOSs. By using a spent medium assay, we further demonstrated that the unsaturated tetrasaccharide (udp4) produced by the primary degrader B. salyersiae could serve as a \"public goods\" molecule for the growth of Bacteroides stercoris, a secondary CS-degrader that was proficient at fermenting CSOSs but not CS. Taken together, our study provides insights into the metabolism of CS by the human gut microbiota, which has promising implications for the development of medical and nutritional therapies for osteoarthritis.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) represents a widespread degenerative disease that causes pain and motor disability. Conservative treatments mainly focus on relieving symptoms, improving joint function, and trying to delay surgery. Safety and efficacy of hybrid cooperative complexes (2.4% sodium hyaluronate and 1.6% sodium chondroitin; HA-SC) for symptomatic KOA were investigated in a single-arm, prospective, pilot study. METHODS: Patients with a visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score ≥ 4 and Kellgren-Lawrence Grade < 4 received a single intraarticular HA-SC injection. Patients with a VAS score change from baseline ≤ 1 received a second injection at day 30. Device-related adverse events (DR-AEs)/adverse events (AEs) were primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints included Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index LK 3.1 (WOMAC LK 3.1), VAS, patient global assessment of disease status (PtGA), and patient proportion needing a second injection. RESULTS: Of 83 patients with KOA (Kellgren-Lawrence Grade, 2-3), 34.9% had DR-AEs at day 7. No serious DR-AEs/AEs were reported. A significant (P < 0.0001) reduction over time in VAS pain score plus WOMAC pain, stiffness, physical function limitation, and total scores was reported. Median PtGA scores indicated a 'slight improvement' at most follow-up visits. Only 18.1% of patients required a second injection. CONCLUSIONS: A single intraarticular HA-SC injection was safe, well-tolerated, and did not lead to major deterioration in terms of reducing knee pain, stiffness, and physical function limitation in patients with symptomatic KOA."

      "abstract": "Most epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients are diagnosed with peritoneal dissemination. Cellular interactions are an important aspect of EOC cells when they detach from the primary site of the ovary. However, the mechanism remains underexplored. Our study aimed to reveal the role of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) in EOC with a major focus on cell-cell interactions. We examined the expression of CSPG4 in clinical samples and cell lines of EOC. The proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities of the CSPG4 knockdown cells were assessed. We also assessed the role of CSPG4 in spheroid formation and peritoneal metastasis in an in vivo model using sh-CSPG4 EOC cell lines. Of the clinical samples, 23 (44.2%) samples expressed CSPG4. CSPG4 was associated with a worse prognosis in patients with advanced EOC. Among the EOC cell lines, aggressive cell lines, including ES2, expressed CSPG4. When CSPG4 was knocked down using siRNA or shRNA, the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities were significantly decreased compared to the control cells. Proteomic analyses showed changes in the expression of proteins related to the cell movement pathways. Spheroid formation was significantly inhibited when CSPG4 was inhibited. The number of nodules and the tumor burden of the omentum were significantly decreased in the sh-CSPG4 mouse models. In the peritoneal wash fluid from mice injected with sh-CSPG4 EOC cells, significantly fewer spheroids were present. Reduced CSPG4 expression was observed in lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1-inhibited cells. CSPG4 is associated with aggressive features of EOC and poor prognosis. CSPG4 could be a new treatment target for blocking peritoneal metastasis by inhibiting spheroid formation.",

      "abstract": "Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) are crucial in maintaining a low-grade inflammatory microenvironment in adipose tissues (ATs). Modulating ATM polarization to attenuate inflammation represents a potential strategy for treating obesity with insulin resistance. This study develops a combination therapy of celastrol (CLT) and phenformin (PHE) using chondroitin sulfate-derived micelles. Specifically, CLT-loaded 4-aminophenylboronic acid pinacol ester-modified chondroitin sulfate micelle (CS-PBE/CLT) and chondroitin sulfate-phenformin conjugate micelles (CS-PHE) were synthesized, which were shown to actively target ATs through CD44-mediated pathways. Furthermore, the dual micellar systems significantly reduced inflammation and lipid accumulation via protein quantification and Oil Red O staining. In preliminary in vivo studies, we performed H&E staining, immunohistochemical staining, insulin tolerance test, and glucose tolerance test, and the results showed that the combination therapy using CS-PBE/CLT and CS-PHE micelles significantly reduced the average body weight, white adipose tissue mass, and liver mass of high-fat diet-fed mice while improving their systemic glucose homeostasis. Overall, this combination therapy presents a promising alternative to current treatment options for diet-induced obesity.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745 requires the principal mode of action (MoA) to be demonstrated by experimental data. The MoA of Ialuril® Prefill (combined as HA+CS+CaCl2: sodium hyaluronate 1.6%, sodium chondroitin sulphate 2% w/v and calcium chloride 0.87%) Class III medical device, indicated for intravesical instillation to reduce urinary tract infections, has been evaluated on a 3D reconstructed human bladder epithelium (HBE). METHODS: Three experimental designs; i) E. coli strain selection (DSM 103538, DSM 1103) to investigate the HA+CS+CaCl2 properties in modifying bacterial growth in liquid broth (CFU 4h and 24h) at 80%, 50% and 25% concentrations; ii) evaluation of film forming properties on HBE after 15 min exposure by quantifying caffeine permeation across the epithelium; iii) capacity to counteract E. coli adhesion and biofilm formation on colonized HBE by viable counts and ultrastructural analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using ciprofloxacin as the reference antimicrobial molecule. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in bacterial viability for both the E. coli strains. HA+CS+CaCl2 reduced caffeine permeation of 51.7% and 38.1% at 1h and 2h, respectively and determined a significant decrease in caffeine permeation rate at both timepoints supporting HA+CS+CaCl2 capacity to firmly adhere to the bladder epithelium creating a physical barrier on the surface. The viable counts in HBE treated tissues then infected with E. coli resulted not different from the negative control suggesting that the device did not inhibit E. coli growth. SEM images showed homogenous product distribution over the HBE surface and confirmed the capacity of HA+CS+CaCl2 to adhere to the bladder epithelium, counteracting biofilm formation. CONCLUSION: The results support the capacity of HA+CS+CaCl2 to counteract bacterial invasion by using a physico-mechanical mode of action: this medical device represents a valid alternative to antibiotics in the treatment of recurrent UTIs."

      "abstract": "Glioma stem cell/glioma-initiating cell (GIC) and their niches are considered responsible for the therapeutic resistance and recurrence of malignant glioma. To clarify the molecular mechanisms of GIC maintenance/differentiation, we performed a unique integrated proteogenomics utilizing GIC clones established from patient tumors having the potential to develop glioblastoma. After the integration and extraction of the transcriptomics/proteomics data, we found that chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) and its glycobiosynthetic enzymes were significantly upregulated in GICs. Glyco-quantitative PCR array revealed that chondroitin sulfate (CS) biosynthetic enzymes, such as xylosyltransferase 1 (XYLT1) and carbohydrate sulfotransferase 11, were significantly downregulated during serum-induced GIC differentiation. Simultaneously, the CS modification on CSPG4 was characteristically decreased during the differentiation and also downregulated by XYLT1 knockdown. Notably, the CS degradation on CSPG4 by ChondroitinaseABC treatment dramatically induced GIC differentiation, which was significantly inhibited by the addition of CS. GIC growth and differentiation ability were significantly suppressed by CSPG4 knockdown, suggesting that CS-CSPG4 is an important factor in GIC maintenance/differentiation. To understand the molecular function of CS-CSPG4, we analyzed its associating proteins in GICs and found that CSPG4, but not CS-CSPG4, interacts with integrin αV during GIC differentiation. This event sequentially upregulates integrin-extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling, which can be inhibited by cyclic-RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) integrin αV inhibitor. These results indicate that CS-CSPG4 regulates the GIC microenvironment for GIC maintenance/differentiation via the CS moiety, which controls integrin signaling. This study demonstrates a novel function of CS on CSPG4 as a niche factor, so-called \"glyco-niche\" for GICs, and suggests that CS-CSPG4 could be a potential target for malignant glioma.",

      "abstract": "Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is a sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) that has captured massive attention in the field of drug delivery. As the colon is considered the preferred site for local and systemic delivery of bioactive agents for the treatment of various diseases, colon-targeted drug delivery rose to the surface of research. Amid several tactics to attain colon-targeted drug release, the exploitation of polymers degraded by colonic bacteria holds great promise. Chondroitin sulfate as a biodegradable, biocompatible mucopolysaccharide is known for its anti-inflammatory, anti-osteoarthritis, anti-atherosclerotic, anti-oxidant, and anti-coagulant effects. Besides these therapeutic functions, CS thrived to play a major role in nanocarriers as a matrix material, coat, and targeting ligand. This review focuses on the role of CS in nanocarriers as a matrix material or as a targeting moiety for colon cancer therapy, relating the present applications to future perspectives.",
