      "abstract": "Background. Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS) is characterized by chronic widespread pain, sleep disturbances, fatigue and cognitive impairment. Methods. In this retrospective study, we analyzed data collected between 2017 and 2022 regarding Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALC) as an add-on treatment in 183 adult patients with FMS according to the 2016 ACR (American College of Rheumatology) criteria and patients' pain lasting for over three months. Patients with prior exposure to ALC or without informed consent were excluded. Results. Regarding efficacy, in the 137 analyzed patients, the change from baseline to the end of observation in Visual Analogue Scale score (VAS) was statistically significant, ranging from 75.9 ± 1.56 to 51.9 ± 1.99 (p < 0.001). Patients without FMS concomitant drug treatments achieved better VAS reduction than patients who were not drug-free at baseline. Regarding quality of life, a significant improvement in the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ-R) score was evidenced, ranging from 75.1 ± 1.13 to 53.5 ± 1.34 (p < 0.001). The Short Form 12 Health Survey (SF12) scores showed a statistically significant improvement in both physical and mental components. Finally, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) did not show a statistically significant difference from baseline. In the whole population, 23 patients (16.7%) reported Adverse Events (AEs), predominantly insomnia, shivering, headaches, and nausea. Only six patients reporting AEs discontinued the ALC treatment. Conclusions. This retrospective study evidenced the efficacy and safety of ALC in FMS patients. This may represent a useful approach, particularly for long-term treatments. Methodologically stronger studies will be necessary to validate our observations."

      "abstract": "AIMS: Obesity, one of the most frequent health risks, represents a global public health problem. The potential impact of L-carnitine, a vital nutrient for energy metabolism, on weight loss is worth considering. However, given the inconclusive results from recent meta-analyses on L-carnitine, we conducted an umbrella meta-analysis of placebo-controlled and controlled trials to evaluate the effect of L-carnitine on anthropometric indices. METHODS: Data synthesis: A comprehensive search approach using the relevant keywords was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus databases, and Google Scholar up to March 2023. Meta-analyses published in English that provided quantitative statistical analyses regarding the effects of L-carnitine on body weight, waist circumference (WC), and body mass index (BMI) were included. A random-effects model and subgroup analysis were performed based on the L-carnitine dosage and study population. RESULTS: A total of 16,352 participants were included. Intervention durations ranged from 8 to 30 weeks, with L-carnitine dosages ranging between 150 and 4000 mg/day. The pooled results of the eight included meta-analyses indicated that L-carnitine supplementation can significantly decrease weight (effect size (ES) = -1.11; 95% confidence intervals (CIs): -1.90, -0.33, p = 0.005; I2 = 90.6%, p < 0.001), BMI (ES = -0.33; 95% CI: -0.61, -0.04, p = 0.026; I2 = 89.8%, p < 0.001), and WC (ES = -1.34; 95% CI: -1.83, -0.85, p < 0.001; I2 = 00.0%, p = 0.442). CONCLUSION: The findings of this umbrella meta-analysis support that supplementation of L-carnitine supplementation can successfully manage weight, BMI, and WC reduction. Therefore, L-carnitine might help treat obesity. PROSPERO Registration Number: CRD42022307951.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the most common and deadly malignancies worldwide, driven by metabolic reprogramming and mitochondrial dysfunction, which support tumor growth and progression. Several studies showed that nutrition is a contributing factor in the prevention and management of CRC. In this context, carnitines, amino acid derivatives abundant in food of animal origin, such as meat and milk, are crucial for mitochondrial function. Recently, l-carnitine and acetyl-l-carnitine have received particular attention due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor properties. However, to date, there is no conclusive evidence on the effects of l-carnitine and acetyl-l-carnitine in CRC or the underlying molecular mechanism. Methods: In this study, we investigated in HCT 116 and HT-29 CRC cells the effects of l-carnitine and acetyl-l-carnitine on mitochondrial homeostasis by XF HS Seahorse Bioanalyzer and cell death pathways by flow cytometry and western blot assays. Results: Data showed that l-carnitine and acetyl-l-carnitine reduced cell viability (p < 0.001), modulated cellular bioenergetics, and induced oxidative stress (p < 0.001). These phenomena promoted autophagic flux and the mitophagy process via PINK1 and Parkin modulation after 72 h of treatment. Of note, the combined treatment with l-carnitine and acetyl-l-carnitine showed a synergistic effect and enhanced the effect of single carnitines on tumor cell growth and metabolic dysfunction (p < 0.05). Moreover, exposure to l-carnitine and acetyl-l-carnitine promoted CRC cell apoptosis, suggesting a mechanism involving mitophagy-related cell death. These data were associated with increased SIRT4 expression levels (p < 0.01) and the activation of AMPK signaling (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Overall, the results, by supporting the importance of nutritional factors in CRC management, highlight l-carnitine and acetyl-l-carnitine as promising agents to target CRC metabolic vulnerabilities.",

The 2025 meta-analysis by Nabi et al., which documented a statistically significant improvement in left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) after L-carnitine supplementation, is the focus of this letter's evaluation of previous data. Although there has been a noticeable increase in systolic performance, there are still conflicting data on diastolic function and left-ventricular mass index (LVMI). Furthermore, it is becoming more widely acknowledged that L-carnitine deficit contributes to malnutrition in patients on maintenance hemodialysis. This highlights the need for thorough, high-quality clinical trials to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of L-carnitine and evaluate its influence on long-term clinical outcomes."

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are a serious problem affecting individuals of all ages. Mitochondrial dysfunctions represent a significant form of secondary injury and may serve as a promising target for therapeutic intervention. Our research demonstrated that craniotomy, which precedes the experimental induction of trauma in mice, can cause considerable damage to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), disrupt the regulatory expression of angiogenesis, and increase inflammation. However, the reduction in the mtDNA copy number and glial activation occur only after a direct impact to the brain. We explored two potential therapeutic agents: the dietary supplement L-carnitine-a potential reserve source of ATP for the brain-and the cardiac drug mildronate, which inhibits L-carnitine but activates alternative compensatory pathways for the brain to adapt to metabolic disturbances. We found that L-carnitine injections could protect against mtDNA depletion by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis. However, they also appeared to aggravate inflammatory responses, likely due to changes in the composition of the gut microbiome. On the other hand, mildronate enhanced the expression of genes related to angiogenesis while also reducing local and systemic inflammation. Therefore, both compounds, despite their opposing metabolic effects, have the potential to be used in the treatment of secondary injuries caused by TBI.",

Therefore, this study aimed to explore the potential effects of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and L-carnitine co-supplementation on migraine symptoms, mental health, and life quality in women with migraine. METHODS: In this randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 80 women with migraine were randomly assigned to receive either ALA (1000 mg) plus L-carnitine (500 mg) or matching placebos daily for 12 weeks. Migraine characteristics, mental health parameters, and quality of life measures were assessed at baseline and study end. RESULTS: The intervention group demonstrated a significant reduction in migraine frequency (-2.96; 95% CI (-3.48, -2.45) vs -0.07; 95% CI (-0.68, 0.53), P < 0.001), severity (-1.6; 95% CI (-2.05, -1.15) vs - 0.44; 95% CI (-0.91, 0.02), P = 0.001), and duration (-4.9; 95% CI (-6.34, -3.45) vs -0.5; 95% CI (-1.06, 0.66) hours, P < 0.001) compared to the placebo group. Mental health improvements were observed in depression (-7.4; 95% CI (-9.24, -5.55) vs 0.05; 95% CI (-1.16, 1.26), P < 0.001), and anxiety scores (-5.7; 95% CI (-7.26, -4.14) vs - 0.65; 95% CI (-2.33, 1.03), P < 0.001). Quality of life measures showed significant enhancement, with increased migraine-specific quality of life (9.75; 95% CI (8.01, 11.49) vs 1.22; 95% CI (-0.66, 3.11), P < 0.001) and decreased headache impact test-6 scores (-8.57; 95% CI (-11.79, -5.36) vs -1.35; 95% CI (-3.41, 0.71), P = 0.005) in the intervention group compared to the controls. CONCLUSION: Co-supplementation with ALA and L-carnitine may offer a promising adjuvant therapy for managing migraine in women, addressing both physical symptoms and psychological burdens.

      "abstract": "Mancozeb is a commonly used fungicide that protects crops from numerous fungal pathogens. However, due to its widespread application, mancozeb has emerged as a significant human health hazard. Mancozeb causes oxidative damage to human cells, including erythrocytes. In this study, we have investigated the cytoprotective potential of the dietary antioxidant, l-carnitine, on mancozeb-induced oxidative damage in human erythrocytes. Incubation of erythrocytes with 100 μM mancozeb for 24 h caused a substantial elevation of markers of hemoglobin, lipid and protein oxidation. Intracellular levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species were considerably increased, and the antioxidant defense system of erythrocytes was severely compromised. Several enzymes catalyzing vital metabolic processes in erythrocytes were significantly inhibited. Mancozeb damaged the plasma membrane, increasing osmotic fragility and cell lysis. Membrane damage resulted in morphological transformation of the normal biconcave erythrocytes to echinocytes and stomatocytes. Erythrocytes incubated with l-carnitine (100-750 μM) for 2 h prior to mancozeb treatment showed a marked reduction in oxidative damage. l-carnitine effectively neutralized free radicals and reactive species, thereby significantly diminishing oxidative stress. The activities of antioxidant and metabolic enzymes were also restored. Preincubation with l-carnitine stabilized the erythrocyte membrane and maintained its standard biconcave shape. Incubation of erythrocytes with l-carnitine alone did not alter any of the above parameters. Thus, l-carnitine can serve as an effective protectant against pesticide-induced cytotoxicity in human erythrocytes.",

However, the remarkable decline in fertility caused by sperm damage during the freezing process restricts its application in the poultry industry. The addition of antioxidants in semen is an effective approach to mitigate oxidative damage and enhance fertility. L-carnitine (LC) is an antioxidant and previous study indicated that it was related with sperm motility regulation. To explore its proper application in rooster semen cryopreservation, this study explored the effect of different levels of LC (0, 0.5 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 mM) on post-tawed sperm motility, morphology, mitochondrial function, antioxidant activity, and fertility potential. The results demonstrated that sperm motility parameters including motility and motion parameters did not differ between groups. The sperm abnormality of 5.0 mM LC was lower than that in the control group (0 mM LC in the basic extender) (P < 0.05). The sperm plasma membrane integrity with 0.5, 2.5 and 5.0 mM LC was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). All the treatment groups showed lower sperm reactive oxygen species than the control group. The 2.5 and 5.0 mM LC groups showed higher fertility (P < 0.05). Overall, this study provides empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of LC for improving the efficiency of roosters' semen cryopreservation in a dose dependent manner, based on the results that supplementation of 2.5 and 5.0 mM LC in the basic extender improved the post-thawed sperm quality and fertility of roosters. In general, our study indicated that the addition of LC exhibited a notable impact on the freezing of rooster semen.",

In the first experiment, oocytes were matured in TCM-199 medium with different concentrations of L-carnitine (0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mM) and after fertilization, presumptive zygotes were cultured for 9 days on mCR2aa medium. In the second experiment, oocytes were matured in a maturation medium with various concentrations of L-carnitine (0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mM). After fertilization, presumptive zygotes were cultured in a culture medium containing various L-carnitine concentrations (0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mM).  In vitro maturation (IVM) was carried out in a humid atmosphere of 5% CO2, 5% O2, and 90% N2 at 38.5 °C, and for in vitro culture (IVC), the concentration of O2 decreased to 5%. Morula and blastocyst development was evaluated on days 5 and 9, respectively. The results of the first experiment showed that the concentrations of 0.125, and 0.25 mM L-carnitine numerically led to an increase in the percentage of morula, blastocyst, and hatched blastocyst compared with control. The percentage of blastocyst formation increased at concentrations of 0.125 mM and 0.25 mM (31.97 ± 0.74 and 31.60 ± 1.39, respectively) compared with the control treatment (29.44 ± 2.42) (p>0.05). The results of the second experiment showed that the different concentrations of L-carnitine, simultaneously in the maturation and culture media of ovine embryos, similar results were observed when it was used only in the maturation medium, and the percentage of blastocyst formation increased at concentrations of 0.125 mM and 0.25 mM (35.62 ± 0.45 and 35.04 ± 1.70, respectively) compared to the control treatment (31.56 ± 3.39) (p>0.05).

Expression of TGF-β gene has been evaluated using Real time‑PCR analysis. RESULTS: The results showed that gingiva-derived mesenchymal stem cells, including CD90 and CD105, consistently showed positive immunostaining, whereas CD45 and CD19 were weakly positive or negative. Concentration-dependent increase of growth proliferation, more rapid proliferation of the cells treated with the highest L-carnitine concentration (10 mM) after 72 h (0.934 ± 0.063). Cells treated with 10 mM L-carnitine showed considerably decreased percentages of necrotic (2.38 ± 0.55), late (1.23 ± 0.90), early apoptotic cells (1.18 ± 0.13), and increased the percentage of viable cells (95.13 ± 1.61). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that adding L-carnitine to gingiva-derived mesenchymal stem cells during expansion enables efficient and viable cell production.",

      "abstract": "L-carnitine (LC) is a natural compound crucial for transporting long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for ATP production. It is found mainly in red meat, fish, and dairy products, in addition to being synthesized by the body. LC is supplemented in patients with organic acidemias since it corrects secondary carnitine deficiency and accelerates the removal of the accumulated acyl organic acid derivative groups. Recently, it was also shown to behave as an antioxidant and an anti-inflammatory agent in various pathological conditions like hypertension, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases. Inflammation is a complex response to tissue damage or infection associated with oxidative stress. LC has been implicated in reducing inflammatory cytokines and other biomarkers. Recent studies suggest that LC supplementation reduces inflammation in chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and neuroinflammation. LC supplementation has been effective in reducing inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukins (IL-6, TNF-α) in various pathologies, including septic shock and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It has also been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with end-stage renal disease. In experimental models, LC revealed neuroprotective effects, improving memory and reducing neuronal death. Additionally, in spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury and acute myocardial infarction, LC treatment diminished inflammation and oxidative stress while improving neurological and cardiac functions. In conclusion, LC supplementation demonstrates significant potential properties in reducing inflammation and improving health outcomes in various pathological conditions, making it a subject of increasing interest in medical research. This article aims to review the literature on the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of LC in different pathologies.",

However, their combined effects on exercise endurance remain unclear. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the effects of ginseng extract and L-carnitine supplementation on exercise endurance in a rat model. Methods: Male Wistar rats were divided into 10 groups (n = 5 per group): control, ginseng extract (250 and 500 mg/kg/day), L-carnitine (250 and 500 mg/kg/day), and combined treatment. Half of the groups underwent a 16-day exercise training program of swimming without loading. Exercise endurance was assessed using a tail-suspended forced swimming test. Relative organ weight, glycogen content, blood biochemistry, and gene expression were analyzed. Results: Both ginseng extract and L-carnitine supplementation significantly increased exercise endurance, particularly in the exercise group. Ginseng extract and L-carnitine also increased liver glycogen content and upregulated the expression of AMPKα1 and PGC-1α genes in the liver and muscle. In addition, both supplements reduced oxidative stress by decreasing MDA levels and increasing SOD activity. Conclusions: Ginseng extract and L-carnitine supplementation may enhance exercise endurance by improving energy metabolism, reducing oxidative stress, and upregulating key genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis.",

      "abstract": "This case reports a couple with infertility due to male factor asthenozoospermia and increased sperm DNA fragmentation along with a slightly thin endometrial lining of the female partner. The male partner received 1 g/day of acetyl-L-carnitine and 2 g/day of L-carnitine for 3 months, following which sperm motility was improved, and DFI was reduced from 45% to 20%. Intracytoplasmic morphologically selected sperm injection (IMSI) was utilized during the in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle to utilize sperms with optimal morphological characteristics for fertilization selectively. To improve endometrial receptivity, the female partner underwent estrogen and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) treatment and the endometrial thickness increased from 6.5 mm to 8 mm, improving endometrial receptivity. A frozen embryo transfer was then carried out after 1 month of the initial cycle. Two weeks after the transfer, a subsequent serum β-hCG level measured 302 mIU/mL, indicating a pregnancy. This case demonstrates the importance of the combined management of acetyl-L-carnitine and L-carnitine supplementation alongside IMSI and PRP in treating the complex etiology of both male and female infertility and leading to successful IVF pregnancy. The systematic approach to focus on aspects that included improving sperm quality as well as the endometrium was therefore important in yielding the result."

      "abstract": "Obesity, a chronic disease with pandemic proportions, is recognized as a major risk factor for cardiometabolic disorders due to its association with atherogenic dyslipidemia, a common characteristic attributed to visceral adiposity in patients with obesity. Atherogenic and visceral-obesity indices have been conceded as surrogate cardiovascular diseases (CVD) indicators surpassing the conventional markers due to stronger predictive power for obesity-induced cardiometabolic risk and CVD mortality rate. Nutraceuticals have been suggested as emerging approaches to counteract obesity-associated cardiometabolic disorders. Considering the evidence addressing the ameliorating effects of either L-carnitine or biotics on metabolic indices, also the reports addressing higher efficacy of concomitant supplementation versus single-therapies, this clinical trial was conducted to assess the effects of L-carnitine + multi-species/multi-strain synbiotic combined supplementation compared to L-carnitine mono-therapy on atherogenic-indices, body composition, visceral obesity, and appetite sensations in 46 metabolically healthy women with obesity, randomly assigned to co-supplementation (L-carnitine-tartrate (2 × 500 mg/dl) + synbiotic (one capsule/day)) or mono-therapy (L-carnitine-tartrate (2 × 500 mg/dl) + maltodextrin (one capsule/day)) groups for 8 weeks. L-carnitine + synbiotic co-supplementation led to a significantly greater reduction in atherogenic-indices including atherogenic-index-of-plasma (AIP), Castelli's-risk-index-I (CRI-I), Castelli's-risk-index-II (CRI-II), atherogenic-coefficient (AC), lipoprotein-combine index (LCI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), fat-mass (FM) weight/percent, visceral-adiposity index (VAI), waste-to-height ratio (WHtR), body-adiposity index (BAI), and appetite sensation scores compared to L-carnitine mono-therapy. L-carnitine + synbiotic combined supplementation was more efficient in improving atherogenic-indices as cardiovascular risk markers, body composition, visceral obesity, and appetite sensations in metabolically healthy women with obesity. Therefore, simultaneous supplementation of L-carnitine + synbiotic might be considered a promising approach to ameliorate cardiometabolic risk factors in healthy individuals with obesity. Further longer period studies are required to confirm these findings. (Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT; https://irct.behdasht.gov.ir/trial/28048 )."

This research aimed to investigate the properties of ALC in combating pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in a rat model. PID, a consequence of sexually transmitted infections in females, can impact the fallopian tubes and uterus, leading to complications. This study is a randomized control preclinical experiment. A total of 24 reproductively mature Sprague Dawley female rats were randomly and equally assigned (n = 4 per group) to six cohorts: control, PID, low-dose prophylactic, high-dose prophylactic, and low-dose therapeutic and high-dose therapeutic groups. PID was induced by injecting the rat cervix with a multi-pathogen solution. Acetyl-L-carnitine, 100 mg/kg (once a day), was orally administered to rats in the low-dose prophylactic group, while 200 mg/kg (once a day) to the high-dose prophylactic group, starting 1 day prior to induction of PID. The therapeutic groups were given similar doses of ALC 1 day after the PID model was confirmed. Samples from the right upper genital tract were collected for ELISA and antioxidant assays, while the left upper genital tract samples underwent histopathological analysis. According to the results, the ALC-treated groups showed a decreased level of cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α) and oxidative stress markers (catalase, lipid peroxidation) when compared to the PID group. Histopathological examinations revealed that ALC treatment reduced the infiltration of neutrophils and lymphocytes in the uterus compared to the PID group. It was concluded that ALC showed potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in PID and, therefore, could be used as a possible option for the treatment of PID."

      "abstract": "Fluoxetine (FXT) and alprazolam (APZ), widely used for mental disorders, have poorly studied adverse effects on mitochondrial function, including oxidative phosphorylation, electron transport, and membrane permeability. This study represents the first investigation using a chick embryo model (HH-stage 10, day 1.5) to analyze the teratogenic effects of FXT and APZ and explore the protective potential of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and L-carnitine (CNT). Administration of FXT (10 μM) and APZ (1 μM) resulted in high teratogenic rates of 53 % and 80 %, respectively, predominantly manifesting as lipid myopathy in hatching muscles, characterized by lipid accumulation, myofibril disruption, inflammation, and edema. Gene expression analysis revealed upregulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and downregulation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), leading to impaired lipid peroxidation and excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Markers of oxidative stress, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and nitric oxide (NO), were significantly elevated, correlating with glutathione (GSH) depletion and mitochondrial ultrastructural damage, resulting in reduced ATP production. Notably, co-administration of CoQ10 and CNT with FXT or APZ significantly improved teratogenic and mortality rates and reduced oxidative stress levels. Specifically, CoQ10 (2 μM) in the FXT group significantly reduced SOD, H2O2, and NO levels, while co-treatment with CNT and CoQ10 (2 μM) in the APZ group significantly alleviated NO levels. This pioneering study highlights the novel and crucial potential of CoQ10 and CNT as nutritional supplements to mitigate mitochondrial damage and antioxidant system imbalance caused by FXT and APZ, providing an innovative strategy for clinical application.",

      "abstract": "A common heavy metal in many facets of daily life is aluminum (AlCl3), which can be found in food, toothpaste, cosmetics, food additives, and numerous pharmaceutical items. The hippocampus, liver, and kidneys have the highest concentrations of this powerful neurotoxin, which also accumulates over time and contributes to the development of a number of cognitive disorders. Long-term overconsumption of AlCl3 results in hepatic and renal toxicity as well as neuronal inflammation. The purpose of the research is to assess the potential protective effects of various L-carnitine dosages as an antioxidant against hebato, renal, and neuronal toxicity in rats caused by aluminum chloride (AlCl3) (20 mg/kg, 1/20 LD 50). Six groups (n = 6), consisting of 36 adult albino rats, were randomly assigned. Saline was administered to the control group (GI) by injection. (GII) had given an injection of L-carnitine at a low-dose of 75 mg/kg body weight. An injections of L-carnitine at a high-dose (150 mg/kg) were given to (GIII), and AlCl3 (20 mg/kg) was given to (GIV). (GV) administered with L-carnitine (75 mg/kg) and AlCl3 (20 mg/kg) by injection. For 60 days, AlCl3 (20 mg/kg) and L-carnitine (150 mg/kg) were administered to GVI by injection. Furthermore, the histological structure of the cortex, hippocampus, and hepatic renal tissues appeared to change in response to AlCl3. L-carnitine therapy lessened the negative effects of AlCl3. The observable improvement in the tissues of the brain, liver, and kidneys further supported this histopathologically. It is possible to draw the conclusion that L-carnitine holds promise as a corrective measure for AlCl3, which causes renal toxicity and neural hepatotoxicity in rats. When it comes to adult albino rats, L-carnitine has a negative impact and exhibits ameliorative effects against aluminum chloride.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is a significant challenge in stroke patients, affecting both rehabilitation and independence. This study aims to evaluate whether early L-carnitine supplementation can effectively improve anthropometric parameters and malnutrition status in acute-phase ischemic stroke patients to mitigate the catabolic state. METHODS: Eighty-two first-ever ischemic stroke patients were randomly assigned to either the L-carnitine group (1000 mg three times/day for seven consecutive days) or the matching placebo group. The study outcomes based on intention-to-treat analyses included changes in weight, body mass index, triceps skinfold thickness, mid-arm circumference, mid-arm muscle circumference, arm muscle area, calf circumference, serum ALB and malnutrition status over the seven-day treatment protocol. Malnutrition was assessed based on the serum ALB concentration, mid-arm muscle circumference, and triceps skinfold thickness. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was applied for assessing the between-group changes along with adjusting the baseline mean value effect. RESULTS: Patients receiving L-carnitine had significantly lower changes in terms of weight, body mass index, triceps skinfold thickness, mid-arm circumference, mid-arm muscle circumference, and calf circumference than did those in the placebo group. After the intervention, the placebo group experienced a significantly greater reduction in the mid-arm muscle circumference indicator (P < 0.001). The between-group change in the serum ALB concentration significantly increased in the L-carnitine group (P = 0.001). Moreover, the L-carnitine group was less malnourished than the placebo group [17 (41.5%) vs. 30 (73.2%), respectively; P = 0.01], after the intrvention. The \"recovery\" frequency was significantly greater in the L-carnitine group (18 (43.9%) vs. 3 (7.3%), P < 0.001) than the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Early L-carnitine supplementation effectively improves anthropometric indices and malnutrition, muscle wasting, and rapid weight loss in acute ischemic stroke patients, highlighting its potential as a supportive nutritional therapy during stroke rehabilitation.

      "abstract": "Phenylketonuria is a genetic disorder characterized by high phenylalanine levels, the main toxic metabolite of the disease. Hyperphenylalaninemia can cause neurological impairment. In order to avoid this symptomatology, patients typically follow a phenylalanine-free diet supplemented with a synthetic formula that provides essential amino acids, including L-carnitine. This work aims to evaluate the potential neuroprotective effects of L-carnitine treatment in the cerebral cortex of rats submitted to a chronic chemically-induced model of Hyperphenylalaninemia, evaluating brain oxidative damage and neuroinflammation. We confirm the effectiveness of the animal model, through the increase of phenylalanine and L-carnitine in blood and cerebral cortex. L-carnitine treatment was effective in significantly decreasing the generation of reactive species and attenuating the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Significant negative correlations between L-carnitine and superoxide dismutase as well as L-carnitine and reactive species generation were also found, reinforcing the involvement of oxidative stress and the effect of L-carnitine. Besides, L-carnitine attenuated the decrease in IL-4 levels, demonstrating both anti-inflammatory properties and a neuroprotective effect, through the decrease in the overexpression of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) present in the cerebral cortex of rats with Hyperphenylalaninemia. Our results highlight the neuroprotective role of L-carnitine in the treatment of Phenylketonuria, mainly against neuroinflammation and the oxidative process, contributing to better clarify the pathophysiology of the disease.",

Thirty-two broiler breeder roosters of the Arian breed were kept at 50 wk of age after a 12-wk acclimatization period. The birds were divided into four treatments and eight replicates in a completely randomized design. Treatments included (1) control (CON), 2) diet supplemented with 150 mg LC per kg diet, (3) diet supplemented with 500 mg L-Arg per kg diet, and (4) diet supplemented with 75 mg LC + 250 mg L-Arg. The use of LC in the roosters' diet increased the concentration, percentages of total mobility, progressive motility, curvilinear velocity and straight line velocity compared to the CON and L-Arg treatment (P < 0.05). The percentage of apoptosis was lower in the LC, L-Arg + LC and L-Arg groups than in the CON group (P < 0.05). In general, LC and the mixture of LC and L-Arg probably improve the sperm quality of aged cockerels through the supply of adenosine triphosphate, antioxidant effects, and the synthesis of nitric oxide.",

Six groups of male albino rats were used: G1 (control); G2 (GSE), given grape seed extract (100 mg/kg b.wt.) orally for 35 days; G3 (L-CA) (150 mg/kg b.wt.); Group 4 (DOX-induced cardiotoxicity), given DOX (10 mg/kg b.wt., i.p.) on the 28th day of the experiment; G5 (GSE + DOX), given GSE and DOX as previously mentioned; and G6 (L-CA + DOX), given L-CA and DOX as previously mentioned. Electrocardiographic evaluation, lipid profile, lipid peroxidation and antioxidants, serum cardiac markers, and inflammatory markers were estimated. Histopathological evaluation of cardiac tissue was also examined. Key findings showed that DOX induced ECG abnormalities lipid peroxidation, reduced antioxidants, and elevated cardiac and inflammatory markers. GSE and L-CA significantly ameliorated ECG abnormalities, reduced lipid peroxidation, improved antioxidant enzymes and serum cardiac markers, and reduced inflammation. These findings suggest that GSE and L-CA exhibit substantial cardioprotective effects in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity via their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potentials."

Drosophila melanogaster offers the potential to model features of Alzheimer's disease, study disease mechanisms, and conduct drug screening. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this work was to analyze the neuroprotective properties of the drug \"carnicetine\", which is an acetylated form of the natural low molecular weight compound L-carnitine. The drug is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and is currently used as a means of improving cellular metabolism. METHODS: Using tissue-specific drivers, direct expression of amyloid beta peptide (42 amino acids) was exhibited in certain groups of neurons in the Drosophila melanogaster brain, namely in dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons. The effect of acetyl-L-carnitine (carnicetine) on the death of these neurons and the memory of flies was analyzed. RESULTS: The expression of amyloid beta peptide in dopaminergic or cholinergic neurons resulted in neurodegeneration of cholinergic neurons in the Drosophila brain and memory impairment. The use of carnicetine added to animal food made it possible to treat these disorders. At the same time, no effect on dopaminergic neurons was noted. CONCLUSION: The data obtained confirmed the neuroprotective properties of the drug under study, demonstrating its participation in the restoration of the cholinergic system and the feasibility of using carnicetine for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 10% of the global population and leads to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Hemodialysis is a common treatment for ESRD, but patients often have low carnitine levels, leading to dyslipidemia, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and the leading cause of mortality. This study aimed to assess the effects of L-carnitine on lipid profiles in adult hemodialysis patients. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted across the online databases from inception to June 2024 to identify randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of L-carnitine on lipid profiles in hemodialysis patients. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed, focusing on primary outcomes, including changes in triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and secondary outcomes including blood pressure (BP) and body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: A total of 28 RCTs were eligible for the current systematic review, including 1,340 hemodialysis patients (671 intervention, 669 control). There were no significant differences in the mean change of TG (SMD: -0.006; 95% CI, -0.272 to 0.259; P = 0.95), TC (SMD: -0.086; 95% CI, -0.253 to -0.079; P = 0.29), HDL (SMD: 0.060; 95% CI, -0.057 to 0.177; P = 0.29), LDL (SMD: -0.075; 95% CI, -0.274 to 0.123; P = 0.43), VLDL (SMD: -0.064; 95% CI, -0.272 to 0.142; P = 0.51), BMI (SMD: -0.025; 95% CI, -0.139 to 0.088; P = 0.56), systolic BP (SMD: 0.055; 95% CI, -0.110 to 0.220; P = 0.43), and diastolic BP (SMD: -0.028; 95% CI, 0.156 to 0.099; P = 0.56). The same insignificant findings were observed after conducting a subgroup analysis based on the route of administration (intravenous vs. Oral). CONCLUSION: L-carnitine supplementation does not significantly change and improve the serum lipid profile, including TG, TC, HDL, LDL, and VLDL levels. Additionally, it has no notable effects on BMI, systolic, or diastolic BP."

      "abstract": "Lipids in cumulus-oocyte complexes are important actors in molecular signalling pathways and are influenced by maturation conditions. Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) is a carrier involved in fatty acid transport and is a promoter of β-oxidation. Although the embryonic development potential of oocytes can be improved when ALC is added to the maturation medium, the effects of ALC on the lipid content and composition of oocytes and cumulus cells remain unknown. In this study, the effect of ALC supplementation on the lipid profiles of buffalo oocytes and cumulus cells after in vitro maturation was evaluated using positive-ion matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis was used to analyse the data. The lipid profiles of oocytes and cumulus cells differed following ALC treatment. Four lipids were significantly different in oocytes and eight in granulosa cells. ALC treatment significantly reduced the cellular content of these lipids, with the exception of phosphatidylcholine [PC(36:3) + H] + in oocytes and triacylglycerol [TAG(58:8) + NH4] + in granulosa cells. Further staining experiments confirmed that ALC treatment reduced the total lipid content in oocytes. Therefore, ALC treatment alters lipid metabolism in oocytes and cumulus cells during their maturation and accelerates lipid metabolism in oocytes. The findings of this study demonstrate that ALC enhances the rate of oocyte maturation by altering lipid metabolism in oocytes, providing both a clear direction for further research into regulatory mechanisms as well as a foundation for further improving oocyte maturation rates.",

However, the effectiveness of dietary fiber, such as inulin, in inhibiting TMAO formation remains controversial. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of inulin supplementation on TMAO formation in mice with high TMAO levels induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) combined with choline and L-carnitine. Results showed that HFD treatment significantly elevated blood TMAO concentrations and increased the abundances of TMAO formation-associated gut bacteria, as well as the abundances of functional genes responsible for TMA formation. While the supplementation of choline and L-carnitine greatly enhanced blood trimethylamine (TMA) and TMAO levels, inulin supplementation did not significantly affect TMAO levels and had limited impact on TMA-associated gut bacteria, except for Desulfitobacterium hafniense."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Simulated Physiological Oocyte Maturation (SPOM) mimics in vitro the physiological events of oocyte maturation in the presence of cAMP modulators. These modulators increase the intracellular concentrations of cAMP, which inhibits the immediate resumption of meiosis and gives the oocyte more time to gain optimal developmental competence. In addition, L-carnitine helps to increase the energy supply of cells through the β-oxidation of fatty acids. This study aimed to investigate the effect of SPOM and L-carnitine supplementation during In Vitro Maturation (IVM) and In Vitro Culture (IVC) on the developmental competence of bovine oocytes. METHODS: Ovarian Cumulus Complexes (COCs) were cultured in the presence or absence of forskolin+IBMX during the first 2 hr of IVM (pre-IVM) with or without L-carnitine (LC) during IVM or IVC in six experimental groups as follows: I) pre-IVM (pre-IVM group), II) pre-IVM with L-carnitine supplementation during IVM (pre-IVM/LC group), III) L-carnitine supplementation during IVM (IVM/LC group), IV) L-carnitine supplementation during in vitro culture (IVC/LC group), V) pre-IVM+ IVC/LC group, and VI) no treatment during IVM and IVC (Control group). The cleavage and blastocyst rates, the blastocysts' total cells number, and the expression of Nanog, Bax, Oct4, Cdx2, and Ifnt genes in resulting blastocysts were assessed. To assess differences among experimental groups, a one-way analysis of variance was initially employed, followed by post hoc Fisher LSD. The difference between groups was considered statistically significant when p<0.05. RESULTS: The cleavage and blastocyst rates in the Pre-IVM and Pre-IVM/LC groups was higher than control group and other groups (p≤0.05) except for IVC/LC and IVM/LC groups, respectively. The number of blastocyst's Inner Cell Mass (ICM) in pre-IVM and Pre-IVM/LC groups as well as the ratio of ICM/TE were higher than control group (p<0.05). The expression of OCT4, CDX2, and IFNT increased in both the pre-IVM and pre-IVM/LC groups compared to the control group (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the application of SPOM-adapted IVM and L-carnitine during IVM of bovine oocyte improves the quantity and quality of the resulting embryos."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most common autoimmune diseases, affecting multiple systems in the body. Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of the most medically valuable active ingredients in cannabis. At present, CBD has been shown to alleviate the progression of RA; however, owing to its multiple targets, the mechanism of CBD is not clear. METHODS: On the basis of the gut microbiota, we explored the mechanism by which CBD inhibits RA progression. Metagenomic and nontargeted metabolomic analyses were used to determine the changes in the intestinal ecology and plasma metabolites of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats after CBD treatment. RESULTS: CBD reversed gut dysbiosis in CIA rats, notably altering the abundances of Allobaculum_unclassified, Allobaculum_fili, and Prevotella_unclassified. In addition, metabolomic analysis confirmed that CBD increased the contents of butyric acid and L-carnitine. Allobaculum could produce butyric acid and Prevotella could accelerate the metabolism of L-carnitine. In addition, in vitro experiments demonstrated that L-carnitine participated in the regulation of neutrophils, macrophages and RA-fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs), which was consistent with the synovial changes in CIA rats caused by CBD. CONCLUSION: In summary, CBD increased the plasma contents of butyric acid and L-carnitine by altering the abundances of gut microbiota, thereby inhibiting inflammation in neutrophils, macrophages and RA-FLSs. Our study is the first to explain the mechanism by which CBD alleviates progression in CIA rats from the perspective of gut microbes and metabolites, providing new views into CBD mechanisms, which warrants clinical attention.",

It was verified an increase of CRP, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, IL-10, NCAM-1 and cathepsin-D in untreated patients compared to controls. On the other hand, reduced levels of TNF-α, CRP, IL-10, NCAM-1 and cathepsin-D were found in plasma from treated patients, as well as increased concentrations of LC. Furthermore, oxidative biomarkers were increased in untreated patients and were normalized with the prolonged treatment with LC.

The high fat content in KD lowers the oesophageal sphincter tone, slows gastric emptying, and decreases intestinal transit time. The primary aim of the current clinical trial was to study the effect of L-carnitine supplementation on gastric emptying in children with drug resistant epilepsy (DRE) on KD. Assessment of the protective effect of L-carnitine on bowel function and habits in those patients was a secondary aim. The current study recruited 30 patients aged 12 months to 18 years newly diagnosed with DRE assigned to start KD who were following up at the Pediatric Clinical Nutrition and Neurology Outpatient Clinics or were admitted due to DRE at the Pediatric Neurology Inpatient Department, Children's Hospital, Ain Shams University (Egypt). Participants were assigned randomly into 2 arms; arm I: received KD with L-carnitine supplementation, arm II: received KD only. Patients were assessed at baseline and after 3 months of starting KD, the assessments of children included: 24-hour dietary recall, Chalfont Seizures Severity Scale, gastrointestinal symptoms score and Bristol stool chart, frequency of defecation per week, anthropometric measurements assessment, fasting serum lipid profile and measurement of the antral length by ultrasound. There was significant increase in antral length in the patients who received KD with L-carnitine supplementation compared to the non-supplemented group. The antral length showed a significant negative correlation with GI symptoms score in all cases and the L-carnitine supplemented group. It also showed a significant positive correlation with Bristol stool score in all patients and a significant positive correlation with stool frequency in the L-carnitine supplemented group only. L-carnitine supplementation to children with DRE on KD has a significant role in improving gastric motility and it increases the frequency of defecation. Further studies are recommended to explore additional benefits, meanwhile it is prudent to advise L-carnitine supplementation for such patients.",

Increasing evidence suggests that age-related alterations in metabolite levels are crucial for the pathogenesis of AD. Here, we analyzed serum metabolites from mice of various ages (2, 4, 14, and 21 months old) using mass spectrometry. We identified palmitoyl-L-carnitine as a key metabolite with significantly increased levels in aged mice. In vitro experiments with SH-SY5Y neuronal cells demonstrated that palmitoyl-L-carnitine treatment enhanced tau phosphorylation, increased mitochondrial fission, and elevated intracellular calcium levels. Furthermore, the increased levels of tau phosphorylation were significantly reduced by the inhibition of GSK-3β, CDK5, and calpain, indicating that tau kinases activated by calcium overload are directly involved in the increase of tau phosphorylation. Considering that mitochondrial fission is related to mitochondrial dysfunction, we propose that the elevated level of serum palmitoyl-L-carnitine during aging contributes to AD pathology through these pathways. These findings highlight the significant role of lipid metabolism in neurodegeneration and offer potential therapeutic targets for age-related diseases, including AD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Frailty is a common complication in patients with liver cirrhosis, which is linked with augmented rates of morbidity and mortality. In this regard, timely nutritional assessment and intervention have gained scientific attention. L-carnitine may be a promising candidate with its potential to enhance energy metabolism, reduce inflammation, and act as an antioxidant. Therefore, we aimed to assess the impact of l-carnitine supplementation on frailty status and liver function in adults with liver cirrhosis. METHODS: This double-blinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial study enrolled 77 patients with liver cirrhosis. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups: the control group (n = 42) and the l-carnitine group (n = 35). The l-carnitine group received 500 mg of l-carnitine orally three times a day for 8 weeks, while the control group did not receive any intervention. RESULTS: L-carnitine administration resulted in a significant decrease in alanine transaminase levels (p: 0.043) and partial thromboplastin time (p: 0.036). Furthermore, compared to the control group, l-carnitine treatment led to improvements in prothrombin time (p: 0.008) and international normalized ratio (p: 0.024). However, no significant improvement in the Liver Frailty Index, Freid Frailty Index, and Karnofsky Performance Status Scale (p > 0.05) was observed in the carnitine group after the 8-week intervention period. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the administration of l-carnitine exhibited hepatoprotective properties and was correlated with lowered alanine transaminase levels with improvement in coagulation status in liver cirrhosis patients. Nevertheless, our study indicated that the short-term use of l-carnitine might not significantly improve frailty in these patients."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Migraine is a severe neurological disorder that is recognized as one of the most common debilitating diseases worldwide. Although the exact cause of migraine is not known, research suggests that inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and insufficient nutrients may contribute to its development. Studies indicate that nutrition-based approaches are safer and more cost-effective strategies for managing migraine symptoms compared to medication. In this regard, the impact of nutrition, as a complementary medicine, is largely attributed to that of certain nutrients on inflammation and mitochondrial function. It is hypothesized that alpha-linolenic acid and L-carnitine, which possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, may be synergically beneficial for migraine patients. Therefore, this study will be conducted to assess the efficacy of alpha-linolenic acid and L-carnitine co-supplementation in patients with migraine. METHODS: This is a parallel, randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, in which 80 women aged 20 to 50 years with migraine will be assigned to receive either intervention group (n = 40) receiving both 1000 mg/day flaxseed oil and 500 mg/day L-carnitine simultaneously for 12 weeks, or control group (n = 40) receiving both 1000 mg/day paraffin oil and 500 mg/day maltodextrin as the placebos for the same duration. The primary outcomes include changes in clinical symptoms of migraine, including frequency, severity, and duration of attacks, serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Secondary outcomes include mental health, sleep quality, and quality of life (QOL). DISCUSSION: In this study, we aim to investigate the potential benefits of combining alpha-linolenic acid and L-carnitine as a treatment option for migraine sufferers. Migraine, characterized by recurrent severe headaches, affects a significant portion of the population and can significantly impact an individual's quality of life. By studying alternative therapies such as alpha-linolenic acid and L-carnitine, researchers hope to expand the range of treatment options available and potentially provide relief to migraine sufferers. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials ( www.irct.ir ) (ID: IRCT20121216011763N57). Registration date: 29 March 2023. TRIAL STATUS: The protocol is version 1.0 dated December 30, 2023. Recruitment began on July 10, 2023, and is expected to be completed by January 22, 2024.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of oral L-carnitine administration in patients after treatment failure to lay the groundwork for targeted in vivo use. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 515 In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) patients undergoing subsequent cycles were included after applying exclusion criteria. They were divided into a control group of 362 patients and a study group of 153 patients who received oral L-carnitine until oocyte retrieval.140 patients were matched according to maternal age, infertility duration, body mass index (BMI), day three top-quality embryos rate, by propensity score matching (PSM). The study investigated the relationship between L-carnitine treatment and in vivo oocyte maturation, normal fertilization, and subsequent embryo development. RESULTS: Following PSM, initial differences in BMI and Day3 top-quality embryo rate between groups were nullified, we created two comparable cohorts with highly similar characteristics. In the subsequent cycles, the study group showed significant improvements in in vivo oocyte maturation rate at retrieval (p=0.002), normal in vitro fertilization rate (p=0.003), blastocyst formation rate (p=0.003), and usable blastocyst rate compared to controls. Although there was no significant difference in the top-quality embryo rate on Day 3, the study group showed a 10% increase in the upper quartile (55.35% vs. 66.67%). The cumulative clinical pregnancy and live birth rates showed a significant improvement (59.82% vs. 68.42%,p=0.004, 47.41% vs. 59.80%, p=0.002). Furthermore, self-control analysis revealed substantial enhancements (p<0.001) in all outcome measures following L-carnitine administration, resulting in the birth of 74 healthy neonates without congenital anomalies. CONCLUSION: We theorized that daily oral intake of L-carnitine before oocyte retrieval could boost oocyte quality and embryonic development, thus improving IVF outcomes. Ongoing investigations hold the potential to offer valuable insights into the applications and mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effectiveness of L-carnitine.",

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to find the possible effect of combining 2 antioxidant agents of melatonin and L-carnitine on oocyte morphology, maturation, apoptosis, and expression of bone morphogenetic protein 15 (BMP-15) and growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF-9) genes in a mice model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To overstimulation, 60 female NMRI mice were injected intraperitoneally using mare serum gonadotropin. On day 2 post-injection, 70 cumulus-oocyte complexes were collected from each mouse. The collected oocytes randomly were then divided into 4 groups including, the control, melatonin, L-carnitine, and melatonin + L-carnitine groups. The morphology and maturation rate of the oocytes was evaluated using a light microscope. Apoptosis was identified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay and the expression of BMP-15 and growth and differentiation factor GDF-9 genes was also evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Oocyte diameter significantly was increased in combination treatment of L-carnitine and melatonin compared to other groups (p < 0.05). L-carnitine group showed the highest mean percentage of oocyte cytoplasmic pattern. Results of the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling indicated that the lowest apoptosis rate belonged to the melatonin + L-carnitine group. Moreover, the combination groups showed the highest number of oocytes and maturation rate. The BMP-15 and GDF-9 genes were significantly upregulated in all treatment groups compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested a combination of melatonin + L-carnitine administration as a more effective choice for in vitro promotion of oocyte maturation."

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Secondary preventive measures, like anti-platelet medications, B-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, have been found to dramatically lower the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, prolonged usage of these drugs has been linked to multiple adverse impacts. Hence, finding more efficient treatments, especially dietary strategies for long-term use in daily life, is advantageous for primary prevention and treatment. L-carnitine, a naturally occurring amino acid derivative normally synthesized in the liver and kidney, is believed to have a considerable influence on cardiovascular health. L-carnitine can enhance both contractile performance and structural integrity of the cardiac muscle by maintaining efficient energy production and reducing oxidative stress. This literature review aims to address several pressing questions regarding the role of L-carnitine in cardiovascular health: what are the physiological functions of L-carnitine, particularly in relation to cardiovascular health; how effective and safe is L-carnitine supplementation in the management of various cardiovascular diseases, primarily ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease; what are the underlying mechanisms through which L-carnitine exerts its cardioprotective effects; what controversies exist in the current research; and finally, what should be the future directions? Through this comprehensive analysis, the review aims to enrich our understanding of L-carnitine's role in cardiovascular health, providing a robust foundation for future academic and clinical endeavors. PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar have been used to search the following keywords: L-carnitine, cardiovascular health, mitochondrial function, and L-carnitine side effects. Then, using the existing search engine formats, some keyword combinations were used to find the related articles included and every possibility, including using every first keyword combination with another keyword, using every keyword in every place at each given box, etc. Around 308 articles were reviewed using this process, including systemic reviews, meta-analysis studies, randomized controlled trials, and literature review articles. In the end, after leaving the pure articles related to the topic as 35 articles, which are attached below with direct citation, the majority of them were very fresh articles, as recent as 2010, and back words, except just one paper related to the impact of L-carnitine post-myocardial infarction, as its data provided us with a positive and promising impact of L-carnitine in this field. L‑carnitine seems to have a pivotal role in cardiovascular health due to its energy metabolism, anti-oxidative stress, and endothelial role. The safety and effectiveness of L-carnitine administration remain an issue for scientific investigation. One of the major concerns is that the intestinal metabolism of L-carnitine generates trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a compound that has been linked with faster atherosclerosis progression."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The adverse effects of radiotherapy (RT) primarily occur through oxidative stress, and attempts are being made to mitigate these effects. L-Carnitine (L-Car) involved in physiological functions, possesses antioxidant and tissue-protective properties. The goal of this investigation is to appraise the radioprotective efficacy of L-Car supplementation. METHODS AND RESULTS: The groups were established by dividing thirty-two rats as: control, RT (10 Gy), RT + L-Car (200 mg/kg/d), L-Car. Upon completion of the experiment, the livers were harvested for histopathological, immunostaining [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), Caspase-3], spectrophotometric [total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS), oxidative stress index (OSI)], and mRNA expression [(Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap-1), Heme Oxygenase (HO-1), Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1)] analyses. In the damage group, decreased Keap-1, Nrf2, HO-1, and TAS values, along with increased histopathological findings, alanine transferase, aspartate transferase, TNF-α, Caspase-3, TOS, OSI, TGF-β1 levels were found. All findings were improved with L-Car treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Considering these findings, it can be inferred that L-Car exhibits tissue-protective effects against organ damage predominantly induced by RT-related oxidative stress. Additionally, it has prevented the development of inflammation, apoptosis, and fibrosis. Therefore, L-Car may be considered as a supplement to reduce complications associated with RT.",

This study aims to present the latest findings on the effectiveness and safety of combining traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with L-carnitine (LC) for treating male infertility. METHODS: We searched 8 databases. Randomized controlled trials of TCM combined with LC therapy versus LC alone in the treatment of male infertility. The outcome included: pregnancy rate, sperm motility, concentration, volume, viability and liquefaction time. Subgroup analyses were also performed according to type of TCM, type of dosage form, and different TCM treatments, and the source of the high heterogeneity was explored. The study is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023421497). RESULTS: 1129 subjects from 12 of the 1833 eligible studies fulfilled the criteria. Compared with LC treatment alone, the combination of TCM and LC significantly improved pregnancy rate [RR = 1.65, 95 % CI (1.37-2.00)], grade (a+b) sperm motility [SMD = 1.56, 95 % CI (1.12, 2.01)], grade (a) sperm motility [SMD = 1.04, 95 % CI (0.69, 1.38)], sperm concentration [SMD = 1.39, 95 % CI (0.91, 1.86)], and sperm viability [SMD = 1.72, 95 % CI (0.83, 2.60)]. Subgroup analyses indicated that Compound Xuanju Capsule and Yougui Capsule demonstrated better efficacy. And the decoction and not-decoction each had their own advantages. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of TCM with LC can have a dual effect: increasing pregnancy rates and sperm quality. Therefore, this combination is a recommended therapeutic strategy and a more appropriate type of TCM can be selected according to the patient's own characteristics."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stem cell-based therapy has emerged as an attractive approach for regenerative medicine. Poor survival and maintenance of the cells used in regenerative medicine are considered as serious barriers to enhance the efficacy of the cell therapy. Using some antioxidants has been reported to prevent the aging of stem cells, and finding effective factors to reduce the senescence of these cells has impressive potential in cell therapy. The PI3K pathway adversely regulates the transcription factors known as FOXO, which are thought to have an inhibitory influence on cell proliferation. By downregulating FOXO and other targets, PI3K signaling controls the growth of cells. For this reason, the aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of L-carnitine (LC) as antioxidant on the cell proliferation and the protein expression of PI3K and FOXO. METHODS: For understanding the in vitro effect of LC on the PI3K and FOXO-1 expression of C-kit+ hematopoietic progenitor cells, the bone marrow mononuclear cells were isolated, and C-kit+ cells was enriched by the magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS). Next, the identification of enriched C-kit+ cells were done by flowcytometry and immunocytochemistry. Then, C-kit+ cells were treated with 0.2 mM LC, the cells were collected at the end of the treatment period (48 h), and the proteins were extracted. In the following, the protein expression of PI3K and FOXO-1 was measured by western blotting. In addition, flowcytometry was done to assess the Ki-67 expression as a key marker for cell proliferation investigation. RESULTS: 0.2 mM LC cause to significantly decrease in the protein expression of PI3K and FOXO-1 (*P<0.05 and **P<0.01, respectively). Also, the expression of Ki-67 was significantly increased in the presence of 0.2 mM LC (***P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Briefly, LC can be considered an effective factor in increasing the proliferation of C-kit+ cells via some signaling pathways.",

Sperm samples were collected from 60 epididymides obtained from 30 adult orchiectomized dogs via retrograde flushing. Twenty pooled sperm samples were then created (3 epididymal samples/pool). Four treatments were established according to the freezing method (CS and UR) and LC supplementation (5 and 0 mM [control, Co]): CS-LC5, CS-Co, UR-LC5, and UR-Co. The CS freezing involved exposing 0.25 mL straw to liquid nitrogen vapors (LN2), while UR freezing submerged 30-µL drops of sperm samples directly into LN2. Sperm kinematics, membrane integrity, and fertilizing ability (by heterologous in vitro fertilization using bovine oocytes) were evaluated for all treatments. Post-thaw results revealed that the CS freezing treatments resulted in significantly higher values (P < 0.05) of curvilinear and average-path velocities, and beat-cross frequency compared to the UR freezing treatments, regardless of LC supplementation. The CS-LC5 and UR-LC5 treatments cryoprotected the sperm by increasing (P < 0.05) the percentage of 'live-sperm/intact-acrosome' compared to their controls treatments CS-Co and UR-Co. Regarding fertilizing ability, the CS-LC5 treatment yielded a higher percentage (P < 0.05) of pronuclei formation compared to both UR treatments. The UR-LC5 treatment, however, obtained greater percentage (P < 0.05) than their control UR-Co. In conclusion, supplementation with L-carnitine in conventional-slow and ultra-rapid freezing improved sperm motility, plasma, and acrosome membranes integrity and fertilizing ability of dog epididymal spermatozoa.",

      "abstract": "The current study was designed to assess the impact of L-carnitine (LC) supplementation in the drinking water of growing Alexandria-line rabbits on performance and physiological parameters. Two hundred eighty-eight 35-day-old rabbits were divided into four groups of twenty-four replicates each (seventy-two rabbits/treatment). The treatment groups were a control group without LC and three groups receiving 0.5, 1, and 1.5 g/L LC in the drinking water intermittently. The results showed that the group receiving 0.5 g LC/L exhibited significant improvements in final body weight, body weight gain, feed conversion ratio, and performance index compared to the other groups. The feed intake remained unaffected except for the 1.5 g LC/L group, which had significantly decreased intake. Hematological parameters improved in all supplemented groups. Compared with those in the control group, the 0.5 g LC/L group showed significant increases in serum total protein and high-density lipoprotein, along with decreased cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein. Compared to other supplemented groups, this group also demonstrated superior carcass traits (carcass, dressing, giblets, and percentage of nonedible parts). In conclusion, intermittent supplementation of LC in the drinking water, particularly at 0.5 g/L twice a week, positively influenced the productivity, hematology, serum lipid profile, and carcass traits of Alexandria-line growing rabbits at 84 days of age."

After prenatal exposure to valproate (VPA; 600 mg/kg, i.p.) on embryonic day 12.5, followed by ALCAR treatment (300 mg/kg on postnatal days 21-49, p.o.), assessment of oxidative stress, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mitochondrial biogenesis, parvalbumin interneurons, and hippocampal volume was conducted. These assessments were carried out subsequent to the evaluation of autism-like behaviors. Hippocampal analysis of oxidative factors (reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde) and antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione) revealed a burden of oxidative stress in VPA rats. Additionally, mitochondrial biogenesis and MMP were elevated, while the number of parvalbumin interneurons decreased. These changes were accompanied by autism-like behaviors observed in the three-chamber maze, marble burring test, and Y-maze, as well as a learning deficit in the Barnes maze. In contrast, administrating ALCAR attenuated behavioral deficits, reduced oxidative stress, improved parvalbumin-positive neuronal population, and properly modified MMP and mitochondrial biogenesis. Collectively, our results indicate that oral administration of ALCAR ameliorates autism-like behaviors, partly through its targeting oxidative stress and mitochondrial biogenesis. This suggests that ALCAR may have potential benefits ASD managing.",

      "abstract": "The debilitating, chronic symptoms of neuropathic pain result in decreased quality of life, depressed mood, and anxiety in patients suffering from neuropathic pain. Despite hundreds of dollars in monthly treatment-related costs, more than half of the patients report inadequate pain relief. Traditional first-line agents are expensive and may have disruptive side effects. Given the disease burden of neuropathic pain, many patients turn to over-the-counter supplements. Here we review two supplements, alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), also known as thioctic acid, and acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC), and data of treatment outcomes from the available literature suggest comparable efficacy to currently available pharmaceuticals for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrates that ALA can significantly improve neuropathic pain and nerve conduction velocity. ALA has been evaluated in the treatment of multiple sources of neuropathic pain, including chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, entrapment neuropathies, radicular nerve pain, and burning mouth syndrome. Common dose-dependent side effects include nausea, vomiting, and vertigo. Cost analysis from June 2022 indicates that a clinically effective dose (600 mg/day) of ALA costs patients $14.40 monthly. Two randomized control trials demonstrate that ALC exhibits neuroprotective effects, can regenerate nerves, and improve vibratory perception in the early stages of DPN. In terms of adverse reactions, no significant differences were observed between treatment and placebo groups, implying that ALC is generally well-tolerated. Cost analysis from June 2022 indicates that a clinically effective dose of ALC (2000 mg/day) costs patients $27.60 monthly. Comparable efficacy in clinical trials, minimal side effects, and lower monthly costs suggest that ALA and ALC should be considered among the accepted first-line treatment options for neuropathic pain."

Dysregulations of FAM3A are involved in the development of diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). So far, the molecule mechanism under the physiological and pathological functions of FAM3A is largely unexplored. Here, we determined the crystal structure of FAM3A at high resolution of 1.38Å, complexed with an unknown-source compound which was characterized through metabolomics and confirmed as methacholine by thermal shift assay and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Exploration for natural ligands of FAM3A was conducted through the same molecular interaction assays. The observed binding of acyl-L-carnitine molecules indicated FAM3A participating in fatty acid beta-oxidation. Knockdown and rescue assays coupled with fatty acid oxidation determination confirmed the role of FAM3A in beta-oxidation. This investigation reveals the molecular mechanism for the biological function of FAM3A and would provide basis for identifying drug target for treatment of diabetes and NAFLD.",

We aim to assess the effect of L-carnitine supplementation on CVD risk factors. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus until October 2022. The main outcomes were lipid profiles, anthropometric parameters, insulin resistance, serum glucose levels, leptin, blood pressure, and inflammatory markers. The pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS: We included the 21 RCTs (n = 2900) with 21 effect sizes in this study. L-carnitine supplementation had a significant effect on TG (WMD = - 13.50 mg/dl, p = 0.039), LDL (WMD = - 12.66 mg/dl, p < 0.001), FBG (WMD = - 6.24 mg/dl, p = 0.001), HbA1c (WMD = -0.37%, p = 0.013) HOMA-IR (WMD = -0.72, p = 0.038 (, CRP (WMD = - 0.07 mg/dl, P = 0.037), TNF-α (WMD = - 1.39 pg/ml, p = 0.033), weight (WMD = - 1.58 kg, p = 0.001 (, BMI (WMD = - 0.28 kg/m2, p = 0.017(, BFP (WMD = - 1.83, p < 0.001) and leptin (WMD = - 2.21 ng/ml, p = 0.003 (in intervention, compared to the placebo group, in the pooled analysis.

      "abstract": "Colistin is a polymyxin antibiotic currently experiencing renewed clinical interest due to its efficacy in the treatment of multidrug resistant (MDR) bacterial infections. The frequent onset of acute dose-dependent kidney injury, with the potential of leading to long-term renal damage, has limited its use and hampered adequate dosing regimens, increasing the risk of suboptimal plasma concentrations during treatment. The mechanism of colistin-induced renal toxicity has been postulated to stem from mitochondrial damage, yet there is no direct evidence of colistin acting as a mitochondrial toxin. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether colistin can directly induce mitochondrial toxicity and, if so, uncover the underlying molecular mechanism. We found that colistin leads to a rapid permeability transition of mitochondria isolated from mouse kidney that was fully prevented by co-incubation of the mitochondria with desensitizers of the mitochondrial transition pore cyclosporin A or L-carnitine. The protective effect of L-carnitine was confirmed in experiments in primary cultured mouse tubular cells. Consistently, the relative risk of colistin-induced kidney damage, calculated based on histological analysis as well as by the early marker of tubular kidney injury, Kim-1, was halved under co-administration with L-carnitine in vivo. Notably, L-carnitine neither affected the pharmacokinetics of colistin nor its antimicrobial activity against relevant bacterial strains. In conclusion, colistin targets the mitochondria and induces permeability transition thereof. L-carnitine prevents colistin-induced permeability transition in vitro. Moreover, L-carnitine co-administration confers partial nephroprotection in mice treated with colistin, without interfering with its pharmacokinetics and antibacterial activity.",

Although inhibition of the cholinesterase enzyme is the main mechanism of ChEI poisoning, oxidative stress is considered the mechanism underlying the related complications. The study aimed to assess the oxidative status of the patients with ChEI insecticide poisoning and the role of L-carnitine as adjuvant therapy in their management. Human studies on the efficacy and safety of L-carnitine in treating insecticide poisoning are limited despite its growing research interest as a safe antioxidant. This prospective study was conducted on eighty patients with acute ChEIs insecticide poisoning admitted to Alexandria Poison Center, Alexandria Main University Hospital, Egypt. Patients were allocated into two equal groups randomly. The L-carnitine (LC) group received the conventional treatment (atropine & toxogonin) and LC and the standard treatment (ST) group received the standard treatment only. Outcome measures were fatality rate, the total administered dose of atropine & toxogonin, length of hospital stay, and the requirement for ICU admission or mechanical ventilation. The study results revealed that malondialdehyde (MDA) significantly decreased in the LC group. Cholinesterase enzyme levels increased significantly after treatment in the LC group than in the ST group. The LC group needed lower dosages of atropine and toxogonin than the ST group. Also, the LC group showed no need for ICU admission or mechanical ventilation. The study concluded that LC can be considered a promising adjuvant antioxidant treatment in acute ChEIs pesticide poisoning."

METHODS: In this study, a rapid stable isotope dilution (SID)-UHPLC-MS/MS method was developed for the simultaneous determination of choline, L-carnitine, betaine, TMA, TMAO and creatinine in plasma, liver and feces of rats. The method was validated using quality control (QC) samples spiked at low, medium and high levels. Second, we applied the method to quantify the effects of Rosa Roxburghii Tratt juice (RRTJ) on plasma, liver, and fecal levels of choline, L-carnitine, betaine, TMA, TMAO, and creatinine in high-fat diet-induced hyperlipidemic rats, demonstrating the utility of the method. RESULTS: The limits of detection (LOD) were 0.04-0.027 µM and the limits of quantification (LOQ) were 0.009-0.094 µM. The linear ranges for each metabolite in plasma were choline1.50-96 µM; L-carnitine: 2-128 µM; betaine: 3-192 µM; TMA: 0.01-40.96 µM; TMAO: 0.06-61.44 µM and creatinine: 1-64 µM (R2 ≥ 0.9954). The linear ranges for each metabolite in liver were Choline: 12-768 µM; L-carnitine: 1.5-96 µM; betaine: 10-640 µM; TMA: 0.5-32 µM; TMAO: 0.02-81.92 µM and creatinine: 0.2-204.8 µM (R2 ≥ 0.9938). The linear ranges for each metabolite in feces were choline: 1.5-96 µM; L-carnitine: 0.01-40.96 µM; Betaine: 1.5-96 µM; TMA: 1-64 µM; TMAO: 0.02-81.92 µM and Creatinine: 0.02-81.92 µM (R2 ≥ 0.998). The intra-day and inter-day coefficients of variation were < 8 % for all analytes. The samples were stabilized after multiple freeze-thaw cycles (3 freeze-thaw cycles), 24 h at room temperature, 24 h at 4 °C and 20 days at -80 °C. The samples were stable. The average recovery was 89 %-99 %. This method was used to quantify TMAO and its related metabolites and creatinine levels in hyperlipidemic rats. The results showed that high-fat diet led to the disorder of TMAO and its related metabolites and creatinine in rats, which was effectively improved after the intervention of Rosa Roxburghii Tratt juice（RRTJ）. CONCLUSIONS: A method for the determination of choline, L-carnitine, betaine, TMA, TMAO and creatinine in plasma, liver and feces samples was established, which is simple, time-saving, high precision, accuracy and recovery.",

Because their effects have not been investigated in naturally occurring canine CKD, we examined their reno-protective activities in dog patients with CKD. A total of 50 patients (OFL, n = 28; control, n = 22) were included in the analysis. A significant difference was identified in serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations between the control and OFL groups at 6 months. No significant difference in electrolytes was found between the groups. A significant difference was identified in serum creatinine concentration between the control and OFL groups in azotemic (CKD IRIS stage 2-4) at 6 months. The OFL compounds showed a reno-protective effect, consistent with previous animal studies. The OFL combination can potentially delay the progression of canine CKD and be used as an adjuvant therapy."

      "abstract": "Lamin A/C gene (LMNA) mutations contribute to severe striated muscle laminopathies, affecting cardiac and skeletal muscles, with limited treatment options. In this study, we delve into the investigations of five distinct LMNA mutations, including three novel variants and two pathogenic variants identified in patients with muscular laminopathy. Our approach employs zebrafish models to comprehensively study these variants. Transgenic zebrafish expressing wild-type LMNA and each mutation undergo extensive morphological profiling, swimming behavior assessments, muscle endurance evaluations, heartbeat measurement, and histopathological analysis of skeletal muscles. Additionally, these models serve as platform for focused drug screening. We explore the transcriptomic landscape through qPCR and RNAseq to unveil altered gene expression profiles in muscle tissues. Larvae of LMNA(L35P), LMNA(E358K), and LMNA(R453W) transgenic fish exhibit reduced swim speed compared to LMNA(WT) measured by DanioVision. All LMNA transgenic adult fish exhibit reduced swim speed compared to LMNA(WT) in T-maze. Moreover, all LMNA transgenic adult fish, except LMNA(E358K), display weaker muscle endurance than LMNA(WT) measured by swimming tunnel. Histochemical staining reveals decreased fiber size in all LMNA mutations transgenic fish, excluding LMNA(WT) fish. Interestingly, LMNA(A539V) and LMNA(E358K) exhibited elevated heartbeats. We recognize potential limitations with transgene overexpression and conducted association calculations to explore its effects on zebrafish phenotypes. Our results suggest lamin A/C overexpression may not directly impact mutant phenotypes, such as impaired swim speed, increased heart rates, or decreased muscle fiber diameter. Utilizing LMNA zebrafish models for drug screening, we identify L-carnitine treatment rescuing muscle endurance in LMNA(L35P) and creatine treatment reversing muscle endurance in LMNA(R453W) zebrafish models. Creatine activates AMPK and mTOR pathways, improving muscle endurance and swim speed in LMNA(R453W) fish. Transcriptomic profiling reveals upstream regulators and affected genes contributing to motor dysfunction, cardiac anomalies, and ion flux dysregulation in LMNA mutant transgenic fish. These findings faithfully mimic clinical manifestations of muscular laminopathies, including dysmorphism, early mortality, decreased fiber size, and muscle dysfunction in zebrafish. Furthermore, our drug screening results suggest L-carnitine and creatine treatments as potential rescuers of muscle endurance in LMNA(L35P) and LMNA(R453W) zebrafish models. Our study offers valuable insights into the future development of potential treatments for LMNA-related muscular laminopathy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pruritus, or itching, is a distressing symptom associated with various dermatological and systemic diseases. L-carnitine (βeta hydroxy-γ-tri methyl amino-butyric acid), is a naturally occurring substance, it controls numerous physiological processes. The present research aims to identify L-carnitine for its anti-pruritic effect via nitric oxide-dependent mechanism. METHODS: Chloroquine-induced pruritus serves as an experimental model to investigate possible therapeutic interventions. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of L-carnitine in combating oxidative stress, nitric oxide, and inflammatory cytokines in a chloroquine-induced pruritus model. RESULTS: L-carnitine treatment significantly reduced scratching behavior compared to the disease group (***P < 0.001 vs. chloroquine group), indicating its antipruritic potential. The markers of oxidative stress, GST, GSH, Catalase, and LPO were dysregulated in the disease model, but administration of L-carnitine restored GST, GSH, and Catalase levels and decreased LPO levels (***P < 0.001 vs. chloroquine group), thereby alleviating oxidative stress. L-carnitine also reduced nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity, suggesting that it modulates nitric oxide signaling pathways involved in pruritus. In addition, L-carnitine lowered levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), inflammatory marker nuclear factor kappa B (p-NFκB) and also reduces an inflammatory enzyme, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), determined by ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) (***P < 0.001 vs. chloroquine group). It downregulates nNOS mRNA expression confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the therapeutic effects of L-carnitine in alleviating chloroquine-induced pruritus.",

L-carnitine (LCAR) is an amino acid with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This study aims to demonstrate the effects of LCAR against radiation-induced acute lung injury and to elucidate its possible protective molecular mechanisms. A total of 32 Wistar albino rats were separated into four groups: control, RAD (10 Gy once on 1st day), RAD + LCAR (intraperitoneally, 200 mg/kg/d, for 10 days), and LCAR. At the end of the experiment, the rats were euthanized, and the lung tissues were collected for histopathological, immunohistochemical, biochemical, and genetic analysis. Emphysema, pronounced hyperemia, increased total oxidant status, and increased caspase-3 and TNF-α immunostainings were all seen in the lung tissues of the RAD group. LCAR treatment reduced these negative effects. In addition, AMPK and SIRT1 gene expressions increased in the RAD + LCAR group compared to the RAD group, while TGF-1ß gene expression decreased. While RAD caused major damage to the lungs of rats, LCAR application reduced this damage through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. Specifically, LCAR reduced fibrosis while attenuating RAD-induced inflammation and oxidative stress via the AMPK/SIRT1/TGF-1ß pathway. Therefore, LCAR can be considered a supplement to reduce complications associated with RAD.",

This study aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic mechanism of L-carnitine (LC) and Ginkgo biloba leaf extract (GB) supplementation in ameliorating the adverse effects of hyperlipidemia and hepatosteatosis induced by a high-cholesterol diet (HCD) in an animal model. The study involved 50 rats divided into five groups, including a control group, a group receiving only an HCD, and three groups receiving an HCD along with either LC (300 mg LC/kg bw), GB (100 mg GB/kg bw), or both. After eight weeks, various parameters related to lipid and glucose metabolism, antioxidant capacity, histopathology, immune reactivity, and liver ultrastructure were measured. LC + GB supplementation reduced serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, alanine transaminase, and aspartate transaminase levels and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels compared with those in the HCD group. Additionally, treatment with both supplements improved antioxidant ability and reduced lipid peroxidation. The histological examination confirmed that the combination therapy reduced liver steatosis and fibrosis while also improving the appearance of cell organelles in the ultrastructural hepatocytes. Finally, the immunohistochemical analysis indicated that cotreatment with LC + GB upregulated the immune expression of GLP-1 and β-Cat in liver sections that were similar to those of the control animals. Mono-treatment with LC or GB alone substantially but not completely protected the liver tissue, while the combined use of LC and GB may be more effective in treating liver damage caused by high cholesterol than either supplement alone by regulating hepatic oxidative stress and the protein expression of GLP-1 and β-Cat.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: L-carnitine (LC), a vital nutritional supplement, plays a crucial role in myocardial health and exhibits significant cardioprotective effects. LC, being the principal constituent of clinical-grade supplements, finds extensive application in the recovery and treatment of diverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders. However, controversies persist regarding the utilization of LC in nervous system diseases, with varying effects observed across numerous mental and neurological disorders. This article primarily aims to gather and analyze database information to comprehensively summarize the therapeutic potential of LC in patients suffering from nervous system diseases while providing valuable references for further research. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Web Of Science, Embase, Ovid Medline, Cochrane Library and Clinicaltrials.gov databases. The literature pertaining to the impact of LC supplementation on neurological or psychiatric disorders in patients was reviewed up until November 2023. No language or temporal restrictions were imposed on the search. RESULTS: A total of 1479 articles were retrieved, and after the removal of duplicates through both automated and manual exclusion processes, 962 articles remained. Subsequently, a meticulous re-screening led to the identification of 60 relevant articles. Among these, there were 12 publications focusing on hepatic encephalopathy (HE), while neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) and peripheral nervous system diseases (PNSDs) were represented by 9 and 6 articles, respectively. Additionally, stroke was addressed in five publications, whereas Raynaud's syndrome (RS) and cognitive disorder (CD) each had three dedicated studies. Furthermore, migraine, depression, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) each accounted for two publications. Lastly, one article was found for other symptoms under investigation. CONCLUSION: In summary, LC has demonstrated favorable therapeutic effects in the management of HE, Alzheimer's disease (AD), carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), CD, migraine, neurofibromatosis (NF), PNSDs, RS, and stroke. However, its efficacy appears to be relatively limited in conditions such as ALS, ataxia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), Down syndrome (DS), and sciatica.",

      "abstract": "Myocardial injury in open-heart surgery is related to several factors including ischemia-reperfusion injury, generation of reactive oxygen species, increased production of inflammatory mediators, and enhancement of apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. The aim of this study was to study the effect of L-carnitine on myocardial injury in children undergoing open-heart surgery. This clinical trial was performed on 60 children with congenital heart disease (CHD) who underwent open-heart surgery. They were randomized into two groups: L-carnitine group who received L-carnitine 50 mg\\kg\\day once daily for 1 month before cardiac surgery and control group who received placebo for 1 month before cardiac surgery. Left ventricular cardiac function was assessed by conventional echocardiography to measure left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (2D-STE) to determine left ventricular global longitudinal strain (2D-LV GLS). Blood samples were obtained pre-operatively at baseline before the administration of L-carnitine or placebo and 12 h post-operatively to measure the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), fas, caspase-3, creatinine kinase-MB (CK-MB), and troponin I. L-carnitine group had significantly lower post-operative level of oxidative stress marker (MDA), apoptosis markers (fas and caspase-3), and myocardial injury markers (CK-MB and troponin I), but they had significantly higher SOD post-operative level compared to the control group. In addition, post-operative LVEF and 2D-LVGLS were significantly lower in the control group compared to L-carnitine group.   Conclusion: L-carnitine can reduce myocardial injury, improve post-operative left ventricular cardiac function, and may provide myocardium protection in children with CHD who underwent open-heart surgery.   Trial registration: The clinical trial was registered at www.pactr.org with registration number PACTR202010570607420 at 29/10/2020 before recruiting the patients. What is Known: • Myocardial injury in open-heart surgery is related to several factors including ischemia-reperfusion injury, generation of reactive oxygen species, increased production of inflammatory mediators, and enhancement of apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. • L-carnitine was reported to have myocardial protective effects in rheumatic valvular surgery and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in adults; however, there is no evidence on its effectiveness in children undergoing open-heart surgery. What is New: • L-carnitine significantly lowered the post-operative level of oxidative stress marker (MDA), apoptosis markers (fas and caspase-3), and myocardial injury markers (CK-MB and troponin I) in the treatment group. • L-carnitine can reduce myocardial injury, improve post-operative left ventricular cardiac function, and may provide myocardium protection in children with CHD who underwent open-heart surgery.",

This study investigated correlations between seminal plasma markers and semen parameters to identify biomarkers that can guide indications for L-carnitine therapy indications in patients with idiopathic sperm abnormalities. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on 223 male patients with idiopathic oligoasthenoteratospermia, who sought medical attention at our clinic between January 2020 and October 2022. These patients underwent a pretreatment seminal plasma biochemical analysis, followed by a three-month continuous L-carnitine treatment. The correlation between seminal plasma biochemical parameters and pretreatment semen parameters was analyzed. Semen quality was compared between cases with normal and abnormal seminal plasma biochemical parameters, both pretreatment and posttreatment. The correlation between the changes in semen parameters after treatment and seminal plasma biochemical parameters were investigated. RESULTS: Correlation analyses revealed significant associations between all pretreatment semen parameters and seminal plasma biochemical markers, except for liquefying time and the ratio of normal morphology. Subgroup analysis, stratified by seminal fructose, zinc, citric acid, and neutral glycosidase levels, demonstrated that abnormal groups exhibited significantly different levels of semen parameters compared with the normal groups. The changing difference and changing ratio in the ratio of forward motile sperm showed a negative correlation with seminal fructose levels (r=-0.165 and -0.144). The changing difference in semen volume was negatively correlated with the level of seminal neutral glycosidase (r=-0.158). The changing ratio in semen volume, sperm concentration, total sperm count, and count of forward motile sperm all exhibited negative correlations with the levels of seminal neutral glycosidase (range from -0.178 to -0.224). CONCLUSION: Seminal plasma biochemical markers, particularly fructose and neutral glycosidase, may serve as valuable indicators for determining the eligibility of patients with idiopathic sperm abnormalities for L-carnitine therapy.",

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of follow-up clinical data (CFS N=12; hypothyroidism with fatigue N=40) where serum serotonin and fatigue levels were compared before vs. after 7 weeks of oral L-carnitine supplementation. RESULTS: After L-carnitine, serotonin increased (8-fold in CFS, Sig. = 0.002, 6-fold in hypothyroidism, Sig. < 0.001) whereas fatigue decreased (2-fold in both CFS and hypothyroidism, Sig. = 0.002 for CFS, Sig. < 0.001 for hypothyroidism). There was a negative correlation between serotonin level and fatigue (for CFS, rho = -0.49 before and -0.67 after L-carnitine; for hypothyroidism, rho = -0.24 before and -0.83 after L-carnitine).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six groups of 36 adult male albino rats (n=6) were randomly formed. In Group I (Gp I), saline injection was given orally as a control. Group II (Gp II) was injected orally with 75 mg/kg body weight of L-carnitine. Group III (Gp III) was given a high dose of L-carnitine (150 mg/kg body weight) orally, while Group IV (G IV) was given a low dose of AlCl3 (20 mg/kg body weight). Group V (Gp V) was given an oral injection of AlCl3 (20 mg/kg) and L-carnitine (75 mg/kg body weight). Group VI (Gp VI) was given AlCl3 at a dose of 20 mg/kg and L-carnitine at a dose of 150 mg/kg body weight for 60 days. The reproductive capacity of each group was assessed. Thus, in addition to histopathological analysis and the comet assay to evaluate sperm DNA deterioration, final body weight, testicular weight change, and sperm analysis were carried out. RESULTS: The findings revealed that AlCl3 caused a significant decrease in final body weight, relative weight of sex organs, sperm concentration, motility and viability, serum testosterone concentration, and a significant increase in sperm abnormalities. Furthermore, AlCl3 caused visible changes in the histological structure of the testis. CONCLUSIONS: L-carnitine treatment alleviated the harmful effects of AlCl3, as evidenced histopathologically by a noticeable improvement in testis tissues. When it comes to treating AlCl3-induced reproductive toxicity in male rat testes, L-carnitine shows promise.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ischemia-reperfusion injury presents a substantial concern in various medical scenarios, notably in reconstructive surgery involving tissue flaps. Despite reports on the protective benefits of Propionyl-l-carnitine against ischemia-reperfusion injury, a thorough assessment of its efficacy in epigastric island flap models is currently lacking. METHODS: Sixteen male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent epigastric island flap surgery and were divided into two groups: a Propionyl-l-carnitine group that received intraperitoneal Propionyl-l-carnitine prior to ischemia induction and a sham group that received saline treatment. A comprehensive evaluation was performed including macroscopic, biochemical and histological assessments encompassing measurements of flap survival areas, lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde), glutathione, myeloperoxidase, nitric oxide and peripheral neutrophil counts. RESULTS: The Propionyl-l-carnitine group demonstrated significantly increased flap survival areas when compared to the sham group. Administration of Propionyl-l-carnitine led to reduced malondialdehyde levels and elevated glutathione levels indicating a reduction in oxidative stress. Furthermore, the Propionyl-l-carnitine group exhibited lower myeloperoxidase levels, higher nitric oxide levels and reduced peripheral neutrophil counts, suggesting a decrease in the inflammatory response. Histopathological analysis revealed decreased levels of inflammation, necrosis, polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration and edema in the Propionyl-l-carnitine group. Additionally, vascularity was enhanced in the Propionyl-l-carnitine group. CONCLUSION: This study provides compelling evidence that Propionyl-l-carnitine administration effectively mitigates the deleterious effects of ischemia-reperfusion injury in epigastric island flaps. This is substantiated by the improved flap survival, diminished oxidative stress and inflammation, as well as the enhanced vascularity observed. Propionyl-l-carnitine emerges as a promising therapeutic intervention to enhance tissue flap survival in reconstructive surgery, warranting further exploration through larger-scale investigations."

      "abstract": "L-Acetylcarnitine (ALC), a versatile compound, has demonstrated beneficial effects in depression, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment, and other conditions. This study focuses on its antithyroid activity. The precursor molecule, L-carnitine, inhibited the uptake of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), and it is possible that ALC may reduce the iodination process of T3 and T4. Currently, antithyroid drugs are used to control the excessive production of thyroid hormones (TH) through various mechanisms: (i) forming electron donor-acceptor complexes with molecular iodine, (ii) eliminating hydrogen peroxide, and (iii) inhibiting the enzyme thyroid peroxidase. To understand the pharmacological properties of ALC, we investigated its plausible mechanisms of action. ALC demonstrated the ability to capture iodine (Kc = 8.07 ± 0.32 x 105 M-1), inhibit the enzyme lactoperoxidase (LPO) (IC50 = 17.60 ± 0.76 µM), and scavenge H2O2 (39.82 ± 0.67 mM). A comprehensive physicochemical characterization of ALC was performed using FTIR, Raman, and UV-Vis spectroscopy, along with theoretical DFT calculations. The inhibition process was assessed through fluorescence spectroscopy and vibrational analysis. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to predict the binding mode of ALC to LPO and to gain a better understanding into the inhibition process. Furthermore, albumin binding experiments were also conducted. These findings highlight the potential of ALC as a therapeutic agent, providing valuable insights for further investigating its role in the treatment of thyroid disorders.",

Hence, antioxidants as additives can be employed to counteract oxidative stress and enhance antioxidant defenses. Therefore, this study investigates the combinatorial effects of vitamin C and l-carnitine on erythrocytes during storage. Methodology: Erythrocyte samples were categorized into control and experimental groups-vitamin C (10 mM) and l-carnitine (10 mM) and stored under blood bank conditions (at 4°C) for 35 days. Hemoglobin (Hb), antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase [SOD], catalase [CAT] and glutathione peroxidase [GPX]), lipid peroxidation products (conjugate dienes and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances [TBARSs]), protein oxidation products, metabolic markers (glucose, lactate dehydrogenase), glutathione (GSH), superoxides, and hemolysis were assessed at weekly intervals. Results: SOD activity increased on day 7 in the controls, whereas it increased on days 7 and 14 in the experimental groups. CAT activity increased on day 35 in both the groups. GPX activity increased on day 7 in the controls. Hb levels decreased on days 14 and 35 in the controls and on day 35 in the experimental groups. Hemolysis increased from day 7 onward in both the groups. Protein oxidation products were maintained throughout the storage. GSH levels increased on day 21 in the controls and on days 14 and 21 in the experimental groups. Superoxides and conjugate dienes decreased from day 14 in both the groups. TBARSs decreased on day 7 in the experimental groups. Conclusion: Vitamin C and l-carnitine have synergistically enhanced the efficacy of stored erythrocytes in terms of Hb, antioxidant enzymes, and lipid peroxidation.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: Journal articles on l-carnitine for OA are gathered using computer searches of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. The kind of literature that is found is restricted to clinical randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The Cochrane Handbook risk of bias assessment tool RevMan 5.4 software is used to conduct a meta-analysis. The systematic assessment comprises eight trials totaling 619 patients; the included studies' quality is mediocre. The study's findings demonstrate that OA patients' Western Ontario and McMaster University (WOMAC) function improves and that treatment efficacy outperforms that of the control group (mean difference [MD] = -7.75, 95% CI [-14.63, -0.86]; Z = 2.21; p = 0.03), WOMAC total (MD = -10.24, 95% CI [-18.97, -1.51]; Z = 2.30; p = 0.02), and visual analogue scale (VAS) pain (MD = -14.01, 95% CI [-16.16, -11.85]; Z = 12.74; p < 0.00001). The studies that are methodically reviewed also discover heterogeneity, which may have resulted from the created pooled data and requires more analysis. CONCLUSION: In patients with OA, l-carnitine effectively decreases clinical signs and symptoms, inflammatory markers, pain, and stiffness indicators, and significantly improves WOMAC and VAS scores.",

      "abstract": "Intestinal symbiotic bacteria play a key role in the regulation of immune tolerance in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) hosts. However, the bacterial strains directly involved in this regulation and their related metabolites are largely unknown. We sought to investigate the effects of intestinal microbial metabolites on intestinal epithelium and to elucidate their therapeutic potential in regulating intestinal mucosal inflammation and immune homeostasis. Here, we used metagenomic data from Crohn's disease (CD) patients to analyze the composition of intestinal flora and identify metabolite profiles associated with disease behavior, and used the mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis to characterize the therapeutic effects of the flora metabolite acetyl l-carnitine (ALC) on DSS-induced colitis. We found that intraperitoneal injection of ALC treatment could significantly alleviate the symptoms of DSS-induced colitis in mice, including prevention of weight loss, reduction in disease activity index (DAI) scores, increasing of colonic length, reduction in histological scores, and improvement in intestinal barrier function. Further, transcriptome sequencing analysis and gene silencing experiments revealed that the absence of CADM2 abolished the inhibitory effect of ALC on the TLR-MyD88 pathway in colonic epithelial cells, thereby reducing the release of inflammatory factors in colon epithelial cells. And we confirmed a significant downregulation of CADM2 expression in intestinal tissues of CD patients compared to healthy people in a population cohort. In addition, we also found that ALC increased the ratio of Treg cells in colon, and decreased the ratio of Th17 cells and macrophages, thereby improving the immune tolerance of the organism. The proposed study could be a potential approach for the treatment of CD.",

L-carnitine treatment was found to control fatty acid transport into the mitochondrial β-oxidation pathway, which improved the process of lipid metabolism. The results of this study show that 0.5 mg/ml L-carnitine significantly reduced the cytoplasmic lipid content relative to control. No significant difference was observed in the rate of oocyte nuclear maturation, but the in vitro developmental competence of SCNT embryos was improved in terms of increased blastocyst production and lower apoptotic index in the L-carnitine treatment group. In addition, the pregnancy rate with SCNT embryos in the treatment group was significantly higher than in the control group. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that adding L-carnitine to the maturation culture medium could improve the developmental competence of SCNT embryos both in vitro and in vivo by reducing the lipid content of the recipient cytoplasm.",

All treatment foods were fed for ninety days. Untargeted blood metabolomic analysis and immune response were measured at the beginning and end of the 90-day feeding trial. Feeding betaine increased single-carbon metabolites while decreasing many carnitine-containing metabolites. Feeding L-carnitine increased many carnitine metabolites, while the combination synergistically influenced the metabolome. The combination of betaine and L-carnitine increased the cytokines released in a Tru-culture system in response to stimulation while numerically decreasing their release when unstimulated. Therefore, the combination of dietary betaine and L-carnitine could have the dual positive effects of reducing cytokine stimulation, controlling inflammation during health, and providing a robust response to bacterial infection."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is a major public health concern among low- and middle-income countries, where the majority of the children encountering this acute form of malnutrition suffer from environmental enteric dysfunction (EED). However, evidence regarding the effects of L-carnitine supplementation on the rate of weight gain and EED biomarkers in malnourished children is limited. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the role of L-carnitine supplementation on the rate of weight gain, duration of hospital stays, and EED biomarkers among children with SAM. METHODS: A prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial was conducted at the Nutritional Rehabilitation Unit (NRU) of Dhaka Hospital, International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh. Children with SAM aged 9-24 mo were randomly assigned to receive commercial L-carnitine syrup (100 mg/kg/d) or placebo for 15 d in addition to standard of care. A total of 98 children with Weight-for-Length-z-score (WLZ) < -3 Standard deviation were enrolled between October 2021 and March 2023. Analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: The primary outcome variable, \"rate of weight gain,\" was comparable between L-carnitine and placebo groups (2.09 ± 2.23 compared with 2.07 ± 2.70; P = 0.973), which was consistent even after adjusting for potential covariates (age, sex, Weight-for-Age z-score, asset index, and WASH practices) through linear regression [ß: 0.37; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.63,1.37; P = 0.465]. The average hospital stay was ∼4 d. The results of adjusted median regression showed that following intervention, there was no significant difference in the EED biomarkers among the treatment arms; Myeloperoxidase (ng/mL) [ß: -1342.29; 95% CI: -2817.35, 132.77; P = 0.074], Neopterin (nmol/L) [ß: -153.33; 95% CI: -556.58, 249.91; P = 0.452], alpha-1-antitrypsin (mg/mL) [ß: 0.05; 95% CI: -0.15, 0.25; P = 0.627]. Initial L-carnitine (μmol/L) levels (median, interquartile range) for L-carnitine compared with placebo were 54.84 (36.0, 112.9) and 59.74 (45.7, 96.0), whereas levels after intervention were 102.05 (60.9, 182.1) and 105.02 (73.1, 203.7). CONCLUSIONS: Although our study findings suggest that L-carnitine bears no additional effect on SAM, we recommend clinical trials with a longer duration of supplementation, possibly with other combinations of interventions, to investigate further into this topic of interest. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT05083637.",

At the end of the study, all rats were sacrificed, and blood and tissue samples were collected for bio-chemical analysis. Oxidative stress parameters and antioxidant enzyme activities were determined in plasma and tissues. Antioxidant and inflammatory genes expression were analyzed in the kidney cortex, and histopathological studies of kidney tissues were performed. This study showed that creatinine and uric acid in plasma were significantly increased in ISO-administered rats. l-carnitine treatment lowered the uric acid and creatinine level. ISO-administered rats showed increased lipid peroxidation and declined levels of antioxidant enzymes activities in kidneys and heart. l-carnitine treatment restored antioxidant enzymes activities and protect against oxidative stress in kidney and heart. This effect is correlated with the restoration of Nrf-2-HO-1 genes expression followed by increased SOD and catalase genes expression in the kidney. l-carnitine treatment also prevented the TNF-α, IL-6, and NF-кB expression in kidneys of ISO administered rats. Histopathology staining showed that l-carnitine treatment prevented kidney damage and collagen deposition in ISO administered rats. The result of this study exhibited that l-carnitine treatment reduced oxidative stress and increased antioxidant enzyme activities by enhancing antioxidant genes expression in ISO administered rats."

METHODS: Thirty male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly allocated to three groups: the normal control group; the Cup group, in which Cup was administrated at a dose of 450 mg/kg per day orally via gastric gavage for 5 weeks; and the Cup + LC group, which received the same dose of Cup as the Cup group, except that the rats were treated additionally with LC 100 mg/kg/day orally for 5 weeks. The nerve conduction (NCV) in isolated sciatic nerves was measured; then, the sciatic nerves were isolated for H&E staining and electron microscope examination. The expression of myelin basic protein (MBP), IL-1β, p53, iNOS, and NF-KB by immunohistochemistry was detected in the isolated nerves. A PCR assay was also performed to detect the expression of antioxidant genes Nrf2 and HO-1. In addition, the level of IL-17 was measured by ELISA. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in NCV in the Cup group compared to normal rats (p < 0.001), which was significantly improved in the LC group (p < 0.001). EM and histopathological examination revealed significant demyelination and deterioration of the sciatic nerve fibers, with significant improvement in the LC group. The level of IL-17 as well as the expression of IL-1β, p53, iNOS, and NF-KB were significantly increased, with significant reduction expression of MBP in the sciatic nerves (p < 0.01), and LC treatment significantly improved the studied parameters (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrates a neuroprotective effect of LC in a Cup-induced demyelinating rat model. This effect might be due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions."

The use of bioactive compounds with anti-inflammatory and hypolipidemic activity in the composition of specialized products and dietary supplements is considered as an approach in the diet therapy of obesity and related conditions. The aim of the research was to study the effect of a complex supplement containing resveratrol and L-carnitine (RC supplement) on the immunological parameters of inflammation (the profile of cytokines and regulatory proteins) in rats fed a balanced or hypercaloric diet. Material and methods. Male Wistar rats received for 63 days a standard balanced diet (SD) or a high-carbohydrate-high-fat diet (HFCD) with an excess of total fat and fructose, as well as RC supplement at a low (25 mg/kg body weight as Res and 300 mg/kg body weight as L-Car) or high (50 and 600 mg/kg body weight, respectively) dose. The content of leptin, ghrelin, cytokines and chemokines in blood serum (BS), lysates of white adipose tissue (WAT) and spleen, amygdala and hippocampus of the brain, the content of regulatory proteins Akt, IRS-1, GCK-3a/b, p70/S6, BAD, m-TOR, PTEN and S6 ribosomal protein in the amygdala and hippocampus have been studied the by multiplex immunoassay. Results. In rats that consumed RC as part of SD, there was a decrease in the levels of leptin and its ratio with ghrelin, the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-12p40 and IL-12p70, IFN-γ) in BS and WAT, chemokines (MCP-1, M-CSF, MIP-2) in WAT. Some of these effects were more pronounced at a low dose of RC than at a large dose, and some of them were also canceled or changed in direction in animals treated with HFCD. In the amygdala, RC consumption increased the content of both pro- and antiinflammatory cytokines; the most significant was the increase in IL-7 levels in animals fed SD, and RANTES in animals fed HFCD. In the hippocampus of rats, the RC intake had an insignificant effect on the levels of cytokines and chemokines. Akt-1 kinase and the substrate of the insulin receptor IRS-1 were the main targets of RC action in the regions of the brain. Conclusion. The complex dietary supplement RC exerted a hypoleptinemic effect, revealed certain anti-inflammatory effects and modulated a number of the brain factors influencing behavioral responses in obesity. However, the synergistic effect of resveratrol and L-carnitine in the composition of the supplement wasn't not observed, and the effectiveness of its action decreased in conditions of a hypercaloric diet consumption.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of L-carnitine supplementation during the controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) cycle with antagonist protocol in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) diagnosis undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This was a double-blind clinical trial study including 110 patients with PCOS attended to Royan Institute between March 2020 and February 2023. At the beginning of the COS cycle, the eligible patients were allocated into two groups randomly according to the coding list of the drugs prepared by the statistical consultant. In the experimental group, patients received 3 tablets daily (L-carnitine 1000 mg) from the second day of menstruation of the previous cycle until the puncture day in the cases of freeze-all embryos (6 weeks) or until the day of the pregnancy test (8 weeks) in fresh embryo transfer cycle. In the control group, patients received 3 placebo tablets for the same period of time. Weight assessment and fasting blood sugar and insulin tests, as well as serum lipid profile were also measured at the baseline and ovum pick-up day. The results of the COS cycle as well as the implantation and pregnancy rates were compared between groups. RESULTS: Finally, 45 cases in L-carnitine group versus 47 cases in the placebo group were completed study per protocol. Data analysis showed that the two groups were homogeneous in terms of demographic characteristics and baseline laboratory tests and severity of PCOS. There is no statistically significant difference in terms of the oocyte recovery ratio and oocyte maturity rate, and the number and quality of embryos, as well as the rates of the fertilization, chemical and clinical pregnancy between groups. However, the means of weight (P < 0.001) and serum levels of fasting blood sugar (P = 0.021), fasting insulin (P = 0.004), triglyceride (P < 0.001) and cholesterol (P < 0.001), LDL (P < 0.001) have significantly decreased in women after consuming L-carnitine supplementation. CONCLUSION: The oral intake of L-carnitine during COS in PCOS women for 6 weeks had no effect on COS and pregnancy outcomes. However, taking this supplement for 6 weeks has been associated with weight loss and improved lipid profile and serum glucose. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered in the Clinicaltrials.gov site on December 17, 2020 (NCT04672720).",

      "abstract": "Mitochondrial metabolism can contribute to nuclear histone acetylation among other epigenetic mechanisms. A central aspect of this signaling pathway is acetyl-L-carnitine (LAC), a pivotal mitochondrial metabolite best known for its role in fatty acid oxidation. Work from our and other groups suggested LAC as a novel epigenetic modulator of brain plasticity and a therapeutic target for clinical phenotypes of depression linked to childhood trauma. Aberrant mitochondrial metabolism of LAC has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to other processes implicated in the pathophysiology of both major depressive disorders and Alzheimer's disease, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and insulin resistance. In addition to the rapid epigenetic modulation of glutamatergic function, preclinical studies showed that boosting mitochondrial metabolism of LAC protects against oxidative stress, rapidly ameliorates insulin resistance, and reduces neuroinflammation by decreasing proinflammatory pathways such as NFkB in hippocampal and cortical neurons. These basic and translational neuroscience findings point to this mitochondrial signaling pathway as a potential target to identify novel mechanisms of brain plasticity and potential unique targets for therapeutic intervention targeted to specific clinical phenotypes."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled trial of 51 patients aged 18 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris was conducted at the Hospital Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah, Universiti Putra Malaysia. The efficacy and tolerability of once-daily adapalene 1.0% were assessed during the 2-week run-in period. Subsequently, patients were randomized to receive either an add-on investigational LicA-containing sunscreen or niacinamide-containing comparator sunscreen every 4 hourly during daytime for 4 weeks. Patients were followed up at Weeks 2 and 4 to assess for improvement in acne severity, PAH, calorimetric parameters and cutaneous tolerability. RESULTS: Two weeks of adapalene usage significantly improved acne severity; however, up to 52% of patients experienced dryness, burning and stinging. Adding LicA-containing or comparator sunscreens was associated with further improvement in acne severity, PAH and calorimetric parameters at the study endpoint. No significant differences in the cutaneous tolerability profiles were observed between treatment groups. Notably, significantly fewer patients receiving LicA-containing sunscreen developed scaliness at Week 4 compared with those in the comparator group. In addition, more patients receiving LicA-containing sunscreen reported less dryness, burning and stinging reactions than the comparator group. Importantly, more patients receiving LicA-containing sunscreen agreed that their treatment led to excellent improvement than the comparator group; of note, one patient reported that their condition worsened with the receipt of the comparator product. CONCLUSION: The concurrent use of LicA-containing sunscreen with adapalene may improve the cutaneous tolerance to adapalene among Malaysian patients."

This prospective observational study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a rehabilitation program combined with the administration of Alpha Lipoic Acid, Acetyl-L-Carnitine, Resveratrol, and Cholecalciferol in the treatment of sciatica due to herniated discs in young patients in terms of pain resolution, postural alterations, taking painkillers, and quality of life. Materials and Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted on 128 patients with sciatica. We divided the sample into 3 groups: the Combo group, which received a combination of rehabilitation protocol and daily therapy with 600 mg Alpha Lipoic Acid, 1000 mg Acetyl-L-Carnitine, 50 mg Resveratrol, and 800 UI Cholecalciferol for 30 days; the Reha group, which received only a rehabilitation protocol; and the Supplement group, which received only oral supplementation with 600 mg Alpha Lipoic Acid, 1000 mg Acetyl-L-Carnitine, 50 mg Resveratrol, and 800 UI Cholecalciferol. Clinical assessments were made at the time of recruitment (T0), 30 days after the start of treatment (T1), and 60 days after the end of treatment (T2). The rating scales were as follows: the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS); the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODQ); and the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). All patients also underwent an instrumental stabilometric evaluation. Results: At T1, the Combo group showed statistically superior results compared to the other groups for pain (p < 0.05), disability (p < 0.05), and quality of life (p < 0.05). At T2, the Combo group showed statistically superior results compared to the other groups only for pain (p < 0.05) and quality of life (p < 0.05). From the analysis of the stabilometric evaluation data, we only observed a statistically significant improvement at T2 in the Combo group for the average X (p < 0.05) compared to the other groups. Conclusions: The combined treatment of rehabilitation and supplements with anti-inflammatory, pain-relieving, and antioxidant action is effective in the treatment of sciatica and can be useful in improving postural stability.",

Fifty eligible volunteers (25 per group) were randomly assigned to either intervention (finasteride + LC and CoQ10 supplements) or control (finasteride + placebo) groups. International prostate symptom score (IPSS), international index of erectile function (IIEF), quality of life index (QoL), as well as serum levels of Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), were assessed.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Hypertension stands as a prominent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, making it of utmost importance to address. Studies have shown that L-carnitine supplementation may lower blood pressure (BP) parameters in different populations. Therefore, we have conducted a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of published Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), including the most recent articles on the effect of L-carnitine supplementation on BP. METHODS: PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane databases, and Scopus were used to collect RCT studies published up to October 2022 without limitations in language. Inclusion criteria were adult participants and recipients of L-carnitine in oral supplemental forms. The funnel plot test, Begg's test, and Egger's test were used to examine publication bias. FINDINGS: After the search strategy, 22 RCTs (n = 1412) with 24 effect sizes fulfilled the criteria. It was found L-Carnitine supplementation did not have a significant effect on systolic blood pressure (SBP) (mm Hg) (weighted mean difference [WMD] = -1.22 mm Hg, 95% CI: -3.79, 1.35; P = 0.352; I2 = 85.0%, P < 0.001), and diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) (WMD = -0.50 mm Hg, 95% CI: -1.49, 0.48; P = 0.318; I2 = 43.4%, P = 0.021) in the pooled analysis. Subgroup analyses have shown that L-carnitine supplementation had no lowering effect on SBP in any subgroup. However, there was a significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure in participants with a baseline body mass index >30 kg/m2 (WMD = -1.59 mm Hg; 95% CI: -3.11, -0.06; P = 0.041; I2 = 41.3%, P = 0.164). There was a significant nonlinear relationship between the duration of L-carnitine intervention and changes in SBP (coefficients = -6.83, P = 0.045). IMPLICATIONS: L-carnitine supplementation in adults did not significantly affect BP. But anyway, more studies should be done in this field on different individuals.",

      "abstract": "A major complication of heat-related illness is the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) and damage to kidney tubular cells. Because kidney tubular cells use fatty acids as a major energy source, impaired fatty acid oxidation (FAO) may be associated with kidney injury due to heat stress. Carnitine is essential in the transportation of fatty acid into mitochondria for FAO. To date, there has been little attention given to the role of carnitine in heat-related illness and AKI. To evaluate the relationship between carnitine inadequacy and heat-related illness severity or AKI, we examined serum carnitine levels in patients with heat-related illness. We also used heat-stressed mice to investigate the effect of l-carnitine pretreatment on various kidney functions such as mitochondrial activity, proinflammatory changes in kidney macrophages, and histological damage. We observed an elevation in serum acylcarnitine levels, indicating carnitine insufficiency in patients with severe heat-related illness and/or AKI. l-Carnitine pretreatment ameliorated ATP production in murine tubular cell mitochondria and prevented a change in the kidney macrophage population dynamics observed in AKI: a decrease in tissue-resident macrophages, influx of bone marrow-derived macrophages, and change toward proinflammatory M1 polarization. In conclusion, carnitine insufficiency may be closely associated with severe heat-related illness and related AKI. Enhancement of the FAO pathway by l-carnitine pretreatment may prevent heat stress-induced AKI by restoring mitochondrial function.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Enhancing fatty acid oxidation (FAO) after acute kidney injury (AKI) improves renal outcomes. This report shows that carnitine insufficiency, which could inhibit FAO, correlates to severe heat-related illness and AKI in a clinical study. We also demonstrate that administering l-carnitine to mice improves mitochondrial respiratory function and prevents deleterious changes in renal macrophage, resulting in improved renal outcomes of heat-induced AKI. l-Carnitine may be an effective preventive treatment for severe heat-related illness and related AKI.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A hypoxic environment often persists within solid tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) can accelerate cancer malignancy by inducing hypoxia-dependent expression of various genes. Tumor hypoxia can also induce metabolic reprogramming of fatty acid (FA) metabolism, through which HIF-1α plays an essential role in diminishing fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) in hypoxic cancer cells. METHODS: We aimed to investigate potential new drug therapy options for targeting hypoxic cancer cells within HCC tumors, specifically through combining HIF-1α inhibition with palmitic acid (PA) + L-carnitine (LC) treatment to effectively induce apoptosis in hypoxic HCC cells. To test this hypothesis, in vitro and in vivo studies were performed. RESULTS: We first demonstrated that hypoxia-dependent apoptosis was induced by an overload of PA in two HCC cell lines (HepG2 and Hep3B) via excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, this observed PA-induced apoptosis was enhanced by HIF-1α knockdown (KD) in these cells under hypoxia. In addition, the combination of PA with FAO activator LC increased FAO activity and led to stronger cell death than PA alone in hypoxic HIF-1α KD cells, specifically through further ROS generation. To clarify the mechanism of hypoxia-induced FA metabolism reprogramming, expression levels of the genes encoding FAO enzymes CPT1A, ACSL1, MCAD, and LCAD, FA transporter CD36, and FA esterification enzymes DGAT and APGAT were analyzed using HIF-1α KD and scramble control (SC) cells. The results suggested that HIF-1α could repress mRNA expression of the FAO-related enzymes and CD36, while it upregulated FA esterification gene expression. This suggested a central role for HIF-1α in hypoxia-induced reprogramming of FA metabolism in HCC cells. Using a nude mouse model, PA administration was found to induce apoptosis from ROS overproduction in HIF-1α KD tumors compared with SC tumors. Additional LC treatment synergistically enhanced the PA-induced apoptosis in HIF-1α KD tumors. Finally, in vivo therapy composed of HIF-1α inhibitor YC-1 with PA + LC could induce ROS-mediated apoptosis in HepG2 tumors without significant toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: A combination therapy of YC-1 with PA + LC may be a unique anti-tumor therapy for targeting hypoxic HCC cells, specifically by ROS overproduction leading to forced FAO activation."

Hence, the current study aimed to investigate the role of miRNA-373/P2X7/NLRP3/NF-κB trajectory in its pathogenesis as well as the possible anti-inflammatory effects of probenecid and l-carnitine in ameliorating osteoarthritis via modulating this pathway. In the current study, male Sprague Dawley rats were used and monoiodoacetate (MIA)-induced knee osteoarthritis model was adopted. Probenecid and/or L-carnitine treatments for 14 days succeeded in reducing OA knee size and reestablishing motor coordination and joint mobility assessed by rotarod testing. Moreover, different treatments suppressed the elevated serum levels of IL-1β, IL-18, IL-6, and TNF-α via tackling the miRNA-373/P2X7/NLRP3/NF-κB, witnessed as reductions in protein expressions of P2X7, NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1 and NF-κB. These were accompanied by increases in procaspase-1 and IκB protein expression and in miRNA-373 gene expression OA knee to various extents. In addition, different regimens reversed the abnormalities observed in the H and E as well as Safranin O-Fast green OA knees stained sections. Probenecid or l-carnitine solely showed comparable results on the aforementioned parameters, whereas the combination therapy had the most prominent effect on ameliorating the aforementioned parameters. In conclusion, l-carnitine augmented the probenecid's anti-inflammatory effect to attenuate MIA-induced osteoarthritis in rats by provoking the miRNA-373 level and inhibiting the P2X7/NLRP3/NF-κB milieu, leading to the suppression of serum inflammatory cytokines: IL-1β, IL-18, IL-6, and TNF-α. These findings suggest the possibility of using probenecid and l-carnitine as a useful therapeutic option for treatment of osteoarthritis.",

The study was performed on three groups of pheasant hens using glycine chelates with calcitriol (group II) or analogical treatment with the addition of l-carnitine at the level of 100 mg/kg of feed (group III) instead of Ca, Fe, Cu, and Zn salts (control). The replacement of inorganic forms with glycinates contributed to an increase in the number of laid eggs with a concomitant lower share of rejected eggs. The supplementation of organic forms of minerals improved mineral absorption and bioavailability in blood serum as well as in the egg yolk of experimental groups. Egg yolk fat was characterized by a higher proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids and a favorable ratio of PUFA ω-3/ω-6. The proposed nutritional supplementation of the pheasant's diet might be a good strategy for increasing the nutritional reserves of poultry and improving their reproduction."

Twenty-four ejaculates were collected from six Damascus bucks, 4 ejaculates each, from mid-September to mid-October 2022. The pooled semen from each collecting session was divided into 5 equal aliquots after being diluted (1:10) with Tris-citric acid egg yolk extender. The first aliquot served as a control (treatment-free). MLT was added to the second and third aliquots at low and high doses (LD: 4 and HD: 8 μL/mL) (v/v), respectively, while L-carnitine (LC) was added to the fourth and fifth aliquots at the same aforementioned doses. The aliquots were stored at 4°C for 48 h to assess sperm physical and morphological characteristics, alongside lipids peroxidase (LP) production and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity. The optimum doses of MLT and LC that showed potential for maintaining sperm characteristics throughout the chilled storage period were further investigated for protecting the spermatozoa after exposure to cryopreservation stress compared to the control. The results showed higher sperm motility (%) in the MLT-HD group, higher (p ≤ .05) sperm viability (%) in the MLT-LD, and both aliquots of LC at T24 hours of chilled preservation. Normal sperm (%) was higher (p ≤ .05) in both LC-LD and MLT-LD groups than other groups, while sperm acrosome integrity (%) was higher (p ≤ .05) in the LC-LD group. Morphological abnormalities (%) were improved (p ≤ .05) in all treated aliquots compared with control. The mean value of GPX activity was higher (p ≤ .05) in both MLT groups, while the concentration of LP increased (p ≤ .05) in the LC-HD or control groups. Furthermore, supplementing buck sperm medium with 4 μL/mL of MLT or LC improved (p < .05) the sperm characteristics and decreased (p < .05) DNA fragmentation index after thawing.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity, a multifactorial disorder with pandemic dimensions, is conceded a major culprit of morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating efficient therapeutic strategies. Nutraceuticals and functional foods are considered promising adjuvant/complementary approaches for weight management in individuals with obesity who have low adherence to conventional treatments. Current literature supports the weight-reducing efficacy of pro/pre/synbiotics or L-carnitine; however, the superiority of the nutraceutical joint supplementation approach over common single therapies to counter obesity and accompanying comorbidities is well documented. This study was designed to assess the effects of L-carnitine single therapy compared with L-carnitine and multistrain/multispecies synbiotic co-supplementation on anthropometric and cardiometabolic indicators in women with obesity. METHODS: The current placebo-controlled double-blind randomized clinical trial was performed on 46 women with obesity, randomly allocated to either concomitant supplementation [L-carnitine tartrate (2 × 500 mg/day) + multistrain/multispecies synbiotic (1 capsule/day)] or monotherapy [L-carnitine tartrate (2 × 500 mg/day) + maltodextrin (1 capsule/day)] groups for 8 weeks. Participants in both groups received healthy eating dietary advice. RESULTS: Anthropometric, lipid, and glycemic indices significantly improved in both intervention groups; however, L-carnitine + synbiotic co-administration elicited a greater reduction in the anthropometric measures including body mass index (BMI), body weight, and neck, waist, and hip circumferences (p < 0.001, <0.001, <0.001, = 0.012, and =0.030, respectively) after adjusting for probable confounders. Moreover, L-carnitine + synbiotic joint supplementation resulted in a greater reduction in fasting blood sugar (FBS), insulin (though marginal), and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and more increment in quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI; p = 0.014, 0.051, 0.024, and 0.019, respectively) compared with the L-carnitine + placebo monosupplementation. No significant intergroup changes were found for the lipid profile biomarkers, except for a greater increase in high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations (HDL-C) in the L-carnitine + synbiotic group (p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: L-carnitine + synbiotic co-supplementation was more beneficial in ameliorating anthropometric indices as well as some cardiometabolic parameters compared with L-carnitine single therapy, suggesting that it is a promising adjuvant approach to ameliorate obesity or associated metabolic complications through potential synergistic or complementary mechanisms. Further longer duration clinical trials in a three-group design are demanded to verify the complementary or synergistic mechanisms.

The Faroese PCD patient cohort has been closely monitored and we now report results from a 10-year follow-up study of 139 PCD patients. Four patients have died of natural causes since diagnosis. There were no signs of cardiac complications related to PCD. 70.5% reported an effect of L-carnitine treatment. 33.7% reported current symptoms with fatigue and low stamina being the most common. 65.1% had experienced side effects during L-carnitine treatment. Most common side effects were fish odor, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. The overall mean L-carnitine dosage was 66.3 mg/kg/day. Free p-carnitine was similar between male and female patients on L-carnitine-18.6 and 18.8 μmol/L, respectively. L-carnitine supplementation seems to be a safe and effective treatment when suffering from PCD. PCD patients in the Faroe Islands are alive and doing well more than 10 years after diagnosis."

We also evaluated the effects of plasma on human umbilical cord-derived endothelial vascular cells (HUVEC) and astrocytes. The analyses were performed at the baseline (T0), after three months (T1), and after six months (T2). In ALS patients at T0/T1, the plasma markers of lipid peroxidation, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and 4-hydroxy nonenal (4-HNE) were higher, whereas the antioxidants, glutathione (GSH) and the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity were lower than in healthy controls. At T2, plasma TBARS and 4-HNE decreased, whereas plasma GSH and the GPx activity increased in ALS patients. As regards NO, the plasma levels were firmly lower at T0-T2 than those of healthy controls. Cell viability, and mitochondrial membrane potential in HUVEC/astrocytes treated with the plasma of ALS patients at T0-T2 were reduced, while the oxidant release increased. Those results, which confirmed the fundamental role of oxidative stress, mitochondrial function, and of the NVU in ALS pathogenesis, can have a double meaning, acting as disease markers at baseline and potential markers of drug effects in clinical practice and during clinical trials."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: We aimed to determine the effect of L-carnitine and spongostan on cartilage healing in an experimental animal model with a full-thickness cartilage defect. METHODS: In the study 32 Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups in equal numbers. A cartilage defect with a diameter of 1 mm and a depth of 3 mm was created in the femoral intercondylar region of rats in groups A, B, and C. Group A received no treatment in the defective area. Group B received treatment with spongostan. Group C received treatment with spongostan soaked in L-carnitine. Group D served as the healthy control group. The rats were euthanized 6 weeks after the treatment. Histological evaluation of the condyles was done with the modified Mankin scoring. RESULTS: In the histopathological imaging of the cartilage structure, it was observed that in group A, there was complete disorganization and cellular structure was completely absent up to the subchondral bone. In group B, moderate structural improvement, partially intact appearance in border integrity and mostly diffuse hypercellularity were observed. In group C, a near-normal healing, a completely intact appearance in boundary integrities and normal or hypercellularity in cellular structure were observed. The total score of the modified Mankin decreases numerically from A to D. There was no statistically significant difference observed between the A-B (p = 0.176), C-D (p = 0.145), and C-B (p = 0.580) groups, while significant differences were detected between the A-C (p = 0.004), B-D (p = 0.007), and A-D (p = 0.000) groups. CONCLUSION: It has been known that mitochondrial activity is reduced in the osteoarthritis, and as a result, decrease in cellular activity occurs with ATP synthesis. For this reason, we found that L-carnitine, which we expect to stimulate cell proliferation by stimulating ATP synthesis, makes a positive contribution to cartilage healing, as expected. It has been found that combining spongostan with L-carnitine for the treatment of cartilage healing, instead of applying spongostan alone, provides near-normal healing.",

PKU patients were treated with a Phe restricted diet supplemented with a special formula containing l-carnitine (L-car), well-known antioxidant compound. The lack of treatment can cause neurological and cognitive impairment, as severe mental retardation, neuronal cell loss and synaptic density reduction. Although Phe has been widely demonstrated to be involved in PKU neurotoxicity, the mechanisms responsible for the CNS injury are still not fully known. In this work, we evaluated markers of neurodegeneration, namely BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), PAI-1 total (Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 total), Cathepsin D, PDGF AB/BB (platelet-derived growth factor), and NCAM (neuronal adhesion molecule) in plasma of PKU patients at early and late diagnosis and under treatment. We found decreased Phe levels and increased L-car concentrations in PKU patients treated with L-car compared to the other groups, indicating that the proposed treatment was effective. Furthermore, we found increased BDNF levels in the patients under treatment compared to patients at early diagnosis, and a positive correlation between BDNF and L-car and a negative correlation between BDNF and Phe. Our results may indicate that in PKU patients treated with L-car there is an attempt to adjust neuronal plasticity and recover the damage suffered, reflecting a compensatory response to brain injury.",

Additionally, the role of cumulus cells in oocyte quality is of utmost importance. Therefore, this study was designed to simultaneously probe into the relative gene expression of oocytes and cumulus cells as biomarkers of oocyte quality with cyclophosphamide and L-carnitine treatment. A total of 60 adult NMRI mice were divided into four groups: control, L-carnitine (LC), cyclophosphamide (CP), and cyclophosphamide+L-carnitine (CP+LC). The relative mRNA expression levels of oocyte quality genes including growth differentiation factor 9 (Gdf9), hyaluronan synthase 2 (Has2), and mitochondrial sirtuin 3 (Sirt3) in oocytes, and genes involved in bilateral communication between cumulus cells and between the oocyte and its neighboring cumulus cells including connexin 37 (Cx37) and connexin 43 (Cx43) were detected by Real-time-PCR. DCFH-DA staining analyzed the level of intracellular ROS in oocytes. Under the influence of L-carnitine, Gdf9, Has2, Cx43, and Cx37 were significantly up-regulated (p ≤ 0.05). However, cyclophosphamide considerably reduced the expression of all these genes (p ≤ 0.05). The expression of the Sirt3 gene in the CP group increased significantly compared to the other groups (p ≤ 0.05). Analysis of fluorescent images revealed that the level of intracellular ROS in the cyclophosphamide group was significantly increased compared to the other groups (p ≤ 0.05), while it plummeted in the L-carnitine group (p ≤ 0.05). L-carnitine as an antioxidant can reduce the destructive effects of cyclophosphamide and enhance bilateral communications between oocytes and cumulus cells, and it may ultimately lead to an increase in the fertility rate.",

Acetyl L-carnitine (ALCAR) has proved useful in the treatment of different types of chronic pain with excellent tolerability. The present work aimed at evaluating the anti-hyperalgesic efficacy of ALCAR in a model of persistent visceral pain associated with colitis induced by 2,4-dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS) injection. Two different protocols were applied. In the preventive protocol, ALCAR was administered daily starting 14 days to 24 h before the delivery of DNBS. In the interventive protocol, ALCAR was daily administered starting the same day of DNBS injection, and the treatment was continued for 14 days. In both cases, ALCAR significantly reduced the establishment of visceral hyperalgesia in DNBS-treated animals, though the interventive protocol showed a greater efficacy than the preventive one. The interventive protocol partially reduced colon damage in rats, counteracting enteric glia and spinal astrocyte activation resulting from colitis, as analyzed by immunofluorescence. On the other hand, the preventive protocol effectively protected enteric neurons from the inflammatory insult. These findings suggest the putative usefulness of ALCAR as a food supplement for patients suffering from IBDs.",

However, high-dose (≥ 6 grams) intravenous supplementation results in a broad range of serum concentrations. We sought to describe the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of high-dose L-carnitine, test various estimates of kidney function, and assess the correlation of PK parameters with pre-treatment metabolites in describing drug response for patients with septic shock. DESIGN: Population PK analysis was done with baseline normalized concentrations using nonlinear mixed effect models in the modeling platform Monolix. Various estimates of kidney function, patient demographics, dose received, and organ dysfunction were tested as population covariates. DATA SOURCE: We leveraged serum samples and metabolomics data from a phase II trial of L-carnitine in vasopressor-dependent septic shock. Serum was collected at baseline (T0); end-of-infusion (T12); and 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment initiation. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION: Patients were adaptively randomized to receive intravenous L-carnitine (6 grams, 12 grams, or 18 grams) or placebo. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The final dataset included 542 serum samples from 130 patients randomized to L-carnitine. A two-compartment model with linear elimination and a fixed volume of distribution (17.1 liters) best described the data and served as a base structural model. Kidney function estimates as a covariate on the elimination rate constant (k) reliably improved model fit. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), based on the 2021 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation with creatinine and cystatin C, outperformed creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault) and older CKD-EPI equations that use an adjustment for self-identified race. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose L-carnitine supplementation is well-described by a two-compartment population PK model in patients with septic shock. Kidney function estimates that leverage cystatin C provided superior model fit. Future investigations into high-dose L-carnitine supplementation should consider baseline metabolic status and dose adjustments based on renal function over a fixed or weight-based dosing paradigm.",

Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) shows neuroprotection through anti-inflammatory effects and via regulation of neuronal synaptic plasticity by counteracting post-trauma excitotoxicity. This study aimed to investigate mechanisms implicated in the etiology of neurodegeneration in rmTBI mice treated with ALC. Adult male C57BL/6J mice were allocated to sham, rmTBI or ALC + rmTBI groups. 15 rmTBIs were administered across 23 days using a modified weight drop model. Neurological testing and spatial learning and memory assessments via the Morris Water Maze (MWM) were undertaken at 48 h and 3 months. RT-PCR analysis of the cortex and hippocampus was undertaken for MAPT, GFAP, AIF1, GRIA, CCL11, TDP43, and TNF genes. Gene expression in the cortex showed elevated mRNA levels of MAPT, TNF, and GFAP in the rmTBI group that were reduced by ALC treatment. In the hippocampus, mRNA expression was elevated for GRIA1 in the rmTBI group but not the ALC + rmTBI treatment group. ALC treatment showed protective effects against the deficits displayed in neurological testing and MWM assessment observed in the rmTBI group. While brain structures display differential vulnerability to insult as evidenced by location specific postimpact disruption of key genes, this study shows correlative mRNA neurodegeneration and functional impairment that was ameliorated by ALC treatment in several key genes. ALC may mitigate damage inflicted in the various secondary neurodegenerative cascades and contribute to functional protection following rmTBI."

This can be prevented through the use of medicines such as L-carnitine and modafinil. The study aimed to examine the effect of L-carnitine and modafinil on fatigue and which one is better for MS patients. This was a clinical trial. This clinical trial was conducted in cooperation between Al-Kut University College and an MS consultant at Al-Zahraa Teaching Hospital in addition to the private neurological clinic from October 1, 2022, to March 15, 2023. Forty participants were split into two groups; both of which were almost identical characteristics regarding age, disease duration, and degree of fatigue. Group I (n = 20): relapsing-remitting MS patients with fatigue received modafinil. Group II (n = 20): relapsing-remitting MS patients with fatigue received L-carnitine. Fatigue was evaluated according to the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS). The statistical work was done in SPSS (IBM Corp., Chicago, IL, USA, version 24). P values were calculated by the t-test. Significant data have P = 0.05. After 2 months of treatment, the results show a significant decrease in MFIS in both groups with a higher reduction in patients who use L-carnitine. Both modafinil and L-carnitine show a significant influence on fatigue in MS patients, and these effects are more in L-carnitine."

Male C57BL/6 mice were orally administered APIC for 8 weeks. The APIC group exhibited a significant increase in treadmill running time until exhaustion compared to the control group. The respiratory exchange ratio in the APIC group was lower, indicating an enhancement in fatty acid oxidative metabolism. Furthermore, APIC supplementation increased the proportion of oxidative myofibers. Biochemical parameters associated with endurance capacity were also affected by APIC, as evidenced by increased muscle ATP levels and decreased levels of muscle triglycerides and blood lactate. qPCR and immunoblot analysis of C2C12 myotubes and gastrocnemius muscles indicated that APIC treatment stimulated AMPK signaling, mitochondrial biogenesis, and fatty acid metabolism. Additionally, treatment with APIC led to an increased oxygen consumption rate in C2C12 myotubes. Collectively, these findings suggest that APIC supplementation enhances mitochondrial biogenesis, promotes a switch from glycolytic to oxidative fiber types, and improves fatty acid metabolism through the activation of the AMPK signaling pathway in murine skeletal muscle. Ultimately, these effects contribute to the enhancement of running endurance.",

Therefore, according to the finding of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effect of L-carnitine supplementation on inflammation in adults. To obtain acceptable articles up to October 2022, a thorough search was conducted in databases including PubMed, ISI Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and Scopus. A random-effects model was used to estimate the weighted mean difference (WMD). We included the 48 RCTs (n = 3255) with 51 effect sizes in this study. L-carnitine supplementation had a significant effect on C-reactive protein (CRP) (p < 0.001), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (p = 0.001), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (p = 0.002), malondialdehyde (MDA) (p = 0.001), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (p = 0.029), alanine transaminase (ALT) (p < 0.001), and aspartate transaminase (AST) (p < 0.001) in intervention, compared to the placebo group. Subgroup analyses showed that L-carnitine supplementation had a lowering effect on CRP and TNF-α in trial duration ≥ 12 weeks in type 2 diabetes and BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2. L-carnitine supplementation reduced ALT levels in overweight and normal BMI subjects at any trial dose and trial duration ≥ 12 weeks and reduced AST levels in overweight subjects and trial dose ≥ 2 g/day. This meta-analysis revealed that L-carnitine supplementation effectively reduces the inflammatory state by increasing the level of TAC and decreasing the levels of CRP, IL-6, TNF-α and MDA in the serum.",

This study investigated the combined effects of L-Carnitine (LC) and Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) on weight loss and adipose tissue microRNA levels. SUBJECTS /METHODS: Forty male Wistar rats weighing 150-200 g and about 8 weeks old were fed either a normal fat diet (NFD) or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks. Afterwards, the HFD group was randomly divided into four subgroups: control, LC (200 mg kg-1), CLA (500 mg kg-1), and both (n = 8 in each group). The study lasted for an additional 4 weeks. The animals' weights were recorded regularly, and after 12 weeks, miRNAs were extracted from epididymal adipose tissue and analysed using real-time PCR. The miRNA expression levels of miR-27a and miR-143 were compared between groups using Kolmogorov-Smirnov and one-way ANOVA tests in SPSS software. RESULTS: At the end of the first 8 weeks, the HFD group weighed significantly more than the NFD group. LC significantly decreased weight gain (4.2%) compared to the control group, whereas CLA alone (3.5%) or in combination with LC (3.1%) did not significantly slow weight gain. Real-time PCR results showed that the HFD group had higher miR-143 levels and lower miR-27a levels compared to the NFD group. LC and CLA increased miR-27a expression after 4 weeks, but their combination decreased miR-27a expression. CLA alone reduced miR-143 expression, whereas LC had almost no effect. Their combination also reduced miR-143 expression. CONCLUSION: CLA and LC, which are considered weight loss supplements, can potentially regulate metabolism and cellular pathways. However, their combination did not show a synergistic effect on weight loss, possibly due to the reduction in miR-27a expression. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effects of combined fat burners on obesity treatment.",

      "abstract": "Methotrexate (MTX)-induced hepatotoxicity is a serious adverse effect that may limit its use. Therefore, eligible drugs to ameliorate MTX-induced hepatotoxicity are required. l-Carnitine (LC) is a natural molecule with beneficial metabolic effects and infliximab (INF) is an anti-inflammatory monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Recently, Notch1/Hes-1 signaling was found to play a key role in the pathogenesis of liver injury. However, its role in MTX-induced hepatotoxicity is unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the modulatory effects of LC or INF on MTX-induced hepatotoxicity and to explore the underlying mechanism with emphasis on the Notch1/Hes-1 signaling pathway. Sixty rats were randomized into six groups (n = 10): (1) control (saline); (2) MTX (20 mg/kg MTX, intraperitoneal [ip], once); (3) LC group (500 mg/kg ip, 5 days); (4) INF (7 mg/kg INF ip, once); (5) MTX+LC (20 mg/kg ip, once, 500 mg/kg ip, 5 days, respectively); (6) MTX+INF (20 mg/kg ip, once, 7 mg/kg INF ip, once, respectively). Oxidative stress, inflammatory markers, and Notch1/Hes-1 were investigated. MTX induced the expression of Notch1 and Hes-1 proteins and increased the levels of TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1β in the liver. Cotreatment with LC or INF showed apparent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Interestingly, the downregulation of Notch1 and Hes-1 expression was more prominent in LC cotreatment as compared with INF. In conclusion, LC or INF attenuates MTX-induced hepatotoxicity through modulation of Notch1/Hes-1 signaling. The LC ameliorative effect against MTX-induced hepatotoxicity is significantly better than that of INF. Therefore, LC cotreatment may present a safe and therapeutically effective therapy in alleviating MTX-induced hepatotoxicity.",

Measurement of arterial stiffness using pulse wave velocity (PWV) enables assessment of atherosclerosis progression in individuals. The authors screened patients with asymptomatic atherosclerosis, based on the PWV findings, to evaluate appropriate early interventions and assess the efficacy of γ-linolenic acid, Vitis vinifera extract, and acetyl-L-carnitine triple combination therapy in atherosclerosis prevention. This retrospective study analyzed the medical records of adult patients between March 2007 and April 2019, with presenting complaints of fatigue and lethargy.

Those with compliance of <80% for any one drug were allocated to the control group to assess changes in arterial stiffness, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), lipid level, and blood pressure (BP). After 1 year of triple-combination therapy, there were significant decreases in right and left baPWV (1537.16 ± 274.84 and 1519.00 ± 289.32 cm/s, respectively) as compared to baseline (1633.15 ± 271. 20 and 1598.64 ± 267.95 cm/s, respectively; p < .001). There was no difference in baPWV between sexes. Moreover, neither group showed significant changes in FPG and lipid levels.

This study investigated the lipotropic benefits of choline or L-carnitine supplementation in lean and obese cats maintaining body weight (BW). METHODS: Lean [n = 9; body condition score (BCS): 4-5/9] and obese (n = 9; BCS: 8-9/9) adult male neutered colony cats were used in a replicated 3 x 3 complete Latin square design. Treatments included choline (378 mg/kg BW0.67), L-carnitine (200 mg/kg BW) and control (no supplement). Treatments were supplemented to the food for 6 weeks each, with a 2-week washout between treatments. Cats were fed once daily to maintenance energy requirements, and BW and BCS were assessed weekly. Fasted blood collection, indirect calorimetry, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry occurred at the end of each treatment period. Serum was analyzed for cholesterol (CHOL), high-density lipoprotein CHOL (HDL-C), triglycerides (TAG), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), glucose, creatinine (CREAT), urea, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Very low-density lipoprotein CHOL (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein CHOL (LDL-C) were calculated. Data were analyzed using proc GLIMMIX, with group and period as random effects, and treatment, body condition, and their interaction as fixed effects, followed by a Tukey's post-hoc test when significance occurred. RESULTS: Cats supplemented choline had lower food intake (P = 0.025). Treatment did not change BW, BCS and body composition (P > 0.05). Obese cats had greater ALP, TAG, and VLDL, and lower HDL-C compared to lean cats (P < 0.05). Choline resulted in greater CHOL, HDL-C, LDL-C and ALT (P < 0.05). L-carnitine resulted in lower CREAT (P = 0.010). Following the post-hoc test, differences between treatment means were not present for ALP (P = 0.042). No differences were found for glucose, urea or NEFA (P > 0.05). Obese cats had a lower fed respiratory quotient (RQ), regardless of treatment (P = 0.045). Treatment did not affect fed or fasted RQ and energy expenditure (P > 0.05). DISCUSSION: Choline appeared to increase circulating lipid and lipoprotein concentrations regardless of body condition, likely through enhanced lipid mobilization and hepatic elimination. Neither dietary choline or L-carnitine altered body composition or energy metabolism in the lean or obese cats, as compared to control."

In this study, 68 children with confirmed ASD were randomly allocated to receive either l-carnitine (150 mg/day) or matched placebo in addition to risperidone. We utilized the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition scale (ABC-C) and a checklist of potential adverse effects to assess changes in behavioral status and safety profile at weeks 0, 5 and 10 of the trial. The primary outcome was defined as a change in the irritability subscale score. Sixty patients with similar baseline characteristics completed the trial period. Although scores of ABC-C subscales significantly decreased in both groups over the trial period, the combination of l-carnitine and risperidone resulted in more reduction on the irritability and hyperactivity subscales compared to the combination of risperidone and placebo ( P  = 0.033 and P  < 0.001, respectively). However, changes in lethargy, stereotypic behavior and inappropriate speech subscales were similar between groups. In conclusion, l-carnitine adjuvant to risperidone could improve irritability and hyperactivity features in children with ASD. Results of this study should be considered preliminary and further clinical trials with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are warranted.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Higher circulating levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), which is a metabolite that can be produced by the gut microbiota from L-carnitine (LC), have been associated with bone mineral density (BMD). Because LC supplementation can improve bone density and microstructural properties in animal models, this study aimed to examine the effects of 12 weeks of LC supplementation on BMD and selected blood markers involved in bone metabolism of postmenopausal women participating in a resistance training (RT) program. METHODS: Twenty-seven postmenopausal women, who had not been treated for osteoporosis, with a total T-score above - 3.0 and no diet differences completed 12 weeks of RT. The participants' diets were supplemented with either 1 g of LC-L-tartrate and 3 g of leucine per day (LC group) or 4 g of leucine per day as a placebo (PLA group), in a double-blind fashion. RESULTS: After the intervention in the LC group, plasma total carnitine and serum decorin levels were higher than the corresponding preintervention values (p = 0.040 and p = 0.042, respectively). Moreover, plasma TMAO and serum SPARC levels were higher in the LC group than the corresponding postintervention values in the PLA group (p < 0.001 and p = 0.030, respectively). No changes in the BMD were observed after 3 months of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Twelve weeks of LC supplementation during RT program increased plasma TMAO levels and appeared to affect signaling molecules, as indicated by the increase in the resting SPARC and decorin levels, with no significant modification in the BMD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Retrospectively registered at the ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05120011)."
