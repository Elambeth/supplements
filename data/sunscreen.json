      "abstract": "Skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in the United States, costing more than $8.1 billion annually in treatment-related expenses, yet with ultraviolet exposure considered the most significant risk factor for skin cancer development, cutaneous malignancy is also highly preventable. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is committed to covering demonstrably effective preventive health care measures without patient cost sharing. To prevent skin cancer, the American Academy of Dermatology recommends applying sunscreen, donning sun-protective clothing, seeking shade, and avoiding midday sun. Additionally, The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends behavioral counseling for skin cancer prevention, including application of broad-spectrum sunscreen, from ages six months to 24 years of age. Despite these evidence-based recommendations and widespread precedent for ACA coverage of certain over-the-counter medications, dermatologic products such as sunscreen are notably excluded. Herein, we address an under-recognized insurance coverage gap for patients by outlining the evidence that sunscreen, as a primary prevention, dually reduces skin cancer incidence and healthcare costs, highlighting the critical need to address barriers to sunscreen utilization. As such, we advocate for amendment of current ACA coverage to include the cost of sunscreen as an evidence-based strategy to decrease the incidence of UV-induced cutaneous disease and associated treatment expenses."

      "abstract": "The extensive use of organic UV filters (OUVFs) has led to these compounds being ubiquitously detected in the environment and considered a new kind of environmental pollutant. As OUVFs cannot be efficiently eliminated by conventional treatment processes, there is an urgent need to develop new innovative solutions for their removal. The present work investigates the efficacy of three Cunninghamella strains in the biodegradation of OUVFs: oxybenzone (BP-3) and 3-(4-methylbenzylidene)camphor (4-MBC). Moreover, a cytochrome P450 (CYP450) inhibition study was conducted, and Cunninghamella-processed samples in silico and in vitro toxicity were evaluated. Our results indicated the ability of Cunninghamella strains to utilize OUVFs. Among the tested Cunninghamella strains, both agents were the most efficiently removed by C. blakesleeana. These results were comparable with A. niger biodegradation capacity. In vitro studies of the fungi-processed samples confirmed no mutagenicity in the Ames test and the lack of cytotoxicity against HepG2 cell line. Moreover, Cunninghamella treatment positively influenced OUVFs SH-SY5Y neurotoxicity and ecotoxicity. After fungal treatment, BP-3 agonistic estrogenic activity was higher, whereas antagonistic androgenic effect was lower than before biotransformation. 4-MBC, after biotransformation, lost agonistic estrogenic activity, but gained antagonistic estrogenic properties. Additionally, this study confirmed the involvement of CYP450 enzymes in BP-3 and 4-MBC biotransformation, thus contributing to a better understanding of the detoxification pathways of OUVFs in fungi. In conclusion, these findings demonstrated, for the first time, that using environmental fungi Cunninghamella for the biodegradation of BP-3 and 4-MBC represents a potent approach for eliminating contaminants from the natural environment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Skin hyperpigmentation is a dermatological concern for pigmented skin phototypes. Despite availability of multiple treatment options, hyperpigmentation management continues to be a challenge. AIMS: Efficacy and safety assessment of the skincare regimen [topical formulation of trihydroxybenzoic acid glucoside 10% (THBG) and α-arbutin 2% (twice-daily) + sunscreen (once daily)] in Indian females with pigmentary spots (facial dark spots or melasma). METHODS: This prospective, open-label, single-arm, interventional study was conducted in Indian females (n = 124), aged 18-45 years, having FitzPatrick skin type III-IV, dull skin, and facial dark spots or melasma. Efficacy of 90-day skincare regimen was evaluated using mexameter, modified melasma area and severity index (mMASI) score, cross-polarized light photography, chromameter, and color-luminosity-brightness-transparency (CLBT) technique. Student's t-test (paired data) was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: In efficacy analysis [modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population], 120 subjects were included. Melanin content of pigmentary spots (on mexametry) significantly reduced (-16.3%, p < 0.001) at Day 90 versus baseline. Significant reduction in severity of melasma was observed (-18.4% in mMASI score) at Day 90. Significant improvement in ΔEab (-8.7%) (change in color difference between pigmentary spot and normal skin) on cross-polarized photographs, in skin-brightening parameters L* (relative brightness/lightness) (-2.7%), ITA° (individual typology angle) (-37.7%), and ΔE* (skin-tone evenness) (-19.0%) using chromameter. Significant improvement in skin radiance was observed in CLBT parameters, color (pink: 32.8%, yellow: -5.5%, and olive: -7.8%), luminosity (6.0%), brightness (4.6%), and transparency (0.2%). Regimen did not cause itching, burning, or irritation. CONCLUSIONS: Skincare regime of 10% THBG and 2% α-arbutin along with sunscreen was effective in reducing pigmentary spots (dark spots and melasma) and was well tolerated in Indian women.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: UVA-UVB increases skin matrix metalloproteinases and breaks down extracellular proteins and fibrillar type 1 collagen, leading to photodamage. Topical application of nicotinamide prevents UV-induced immunosuppression. Several studies have demonstrated the importance of protection against UV. This study aims to determine the biological effect of a high broad-spectrum UVB-UVA sunscreen containing nicotinamide and panthenol (SSNP) on photodamaged skin using linear confocal optical coherence tomography (LC-OCT), immunohistochemistry, and RNA profiling. METHODS: Two areas of severely photodamaged forearm skin (L01 and L02) and one less sun-damaged (naturally protected) area on the inner part of the forearm (L03) were identified in 14 subjects. These areas were imaged using LC-OCT and L01 and L03 were biopsied at baseline. After 4 weeks of treatment with SSNP, L02 was reimaged using LC-OCT, and biopsied. Histology, immunostaining with p21, p53, PCNA, and CPD, and RNA sequencing were performed in all samples. RESULTS: LC-OCT analysis showed that epidermis thickness and the number of keratinocytes is higher in the sun-exposed areas than in the non-exposed areas. Comparing before and after treatment, even though there is a trend towards normalization, the differences were not statistically significant. The expression of p21, PCNA, p53, and CPD increased in severely photodamaged skin compared to less-damaged skin. When comparing before and after treatment, only p21 showed a trend to decrease expression. RNA sequencing analysis identified 1552 significant genes correlating with the progression from non-visibly photodamaged skin to post-treatment and pre-treatment samples; in the analysis comparing pre- and post-treatment samples, 5429 genes were found to be significantly associated. A total of 1115 genes are common in these two analyses. Additionally, nine significant genes from the first analysis and eight from the second are related to collagen. Six of these collagen genes are common in the two analyses. MAPK and cGMP-PKG signalling pathways are upregulated in the progression to photodamage analysis. In the pre- and post-treatment analysis, 32 pathways are downregulated after treatment, the most statistically significant being the ErbB, Hippo, NOD-like receptor, TNF, and NF-kB signalling pathways. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the role of SSNP in collagen generation, highlights the relevance of the cGMP-PKG and MAPK signalling pathways in photodamage, and shows the ability of SSNP to downregulate pathways activated by UV exposure. Additionally, it deepens our understanding of the effect of SSNP on immune-related pathways."

      "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a growing demand for high-quality sunscreens that combine high efficacy with ecological characteristics. This trend has led to an increased use of triazine compounds, which represent an emerging class of UV filters. While it is well-established that sunscreens can have significant environmental impacts, there is limited data on the degradation of triazine UV filters, despite available information on their environmental persistence, particularly in relation to disinfection processes. This study investigates the chemical fate of ethylhexyl triazone (EHT) under chlorination conditions, typical of swimming pools. Twelve disinfection byproducts (DBPs) were isolated and fully identified using nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry, with three of these byproducts being identified for the first time. DBP1-DBP12 were isolated at relative percentages of 1.26, 9.68, 1.05, 0.42, 0.84, 3.37, 3.58, 1.89, 0.84, 1.47, 0.42, and 0.63. Additionally, a mechanism for their formation was proposed. The ecotoxicological assessment of EHT and of byproducts (DBP1-DBP4) was conducted using acute, sub-chronic or chronic toxicity tests in producers and primary consumers of the freshwater trophic chain. The organisms included the alga Raphidocelis subcapitata, the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus, the crustacean anostracan Thamnocephalus platyurus and the benthic ostracod Heterocypris incongruens. EHT caused a lethal median concentration in rotifers, with values in the range of tens of mg/L. EHT, DBP1, and DBP4 exhibited sub-chronic effects in ostracods at concentrations in the μg/L range, with EC50s of 210, 9, 20 μg/L, respectively. Rotifers were slightly affected by DBP3 with a chronic EC50 of 200 μg/L. Algae were not affected by either EHT or byproducts.",

      "abstract": "SETTING: This study evaluates the impact of sunscreen dispensers in increasing sunscreen usage and awareness in Summerside, Prince Edward Island, Canada. INTERVENTION: In June 2022, three touchless sunscreen dispensers offering free Health Canada-approved SPF 30 sunscreen were installed in areas of high pedestrian traffic. A team of four city workers gathered observational data over a 17-day span between July and August 2022. OUTCOMES: Seven days of monitoring took place at the city ballpark, seven at a children's park, and three at the city beachfront boardwalk. In total, 1202 individuals were observed near the dispensers, of whom 209 utilized the dispensers, yielding a usage rate of 17.4 per 100 persons. The usage rate varied by location, with the children's park recording a higher average (40.0 users per 100 persons), and was also weather-dependent, with increased usage on sunny days (average of 52.2 users per 100 persons). The majority of users were classified with a Fitzpatrick skin type of I or II. The sunscreen bags, designed for 2000 applications, did not require refilling during the observation period. The QR code associated with the dispensers was scanned 14 times. IMPLICATIONS: The findings of this study indicate that installing sunscreen dispensers in public spaces may increase the frequency of sunscreen application. Both the location of the dispensers and the perception of weather conditions seem to impact usage rates.",

While the risks of not wearing sunscreen are well-documented, there are no effective interventions to promote sunscreen use across populations, and existing interventions have modest outcomes. The current study investigated a novel intervention to increase sunscreen use. METHODS: Participants (n=15) first reported their baseline daily sunscreen use then completed sunscreen sampling and selection procedures that included testing sunscreen samples, choosing preferred sunscreens to take home and sample further, and ultimately selecting a preferred sunscreen to use for the remainder of the study. Participants then self-reported their daily sunscreen use for approximately two weeks (+/-5 days). RESULTS: All participants increased sunscreen use following intervention. LIMITATIONS: Data were collected between January and May; individuals may increase sunscreen use as temperatures increase (and time outdoors increases). Additionally, the current study relied on self-report of sunscreen use primarily. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that sampling and election procedures may be an effective strategy to promote sunscreen use. The findings of this study may inform future research examining sunscreen intervention strategies."

      "abstract": "In recent years, concerns about the harmful effects of synthetic UV filters on the environment have highlighted the need for natural sun blockers. Lignin, the most abundant aromatic renewable biopolymer on Earth, is a promising candidate for next-generation sunscreen due to its inherent UV absorbance and its green, biodegradable, and biocompatible properties. Lignin's limitations, such as its dark color and poor dispersity, can be overcome by reducing particle size to the nanoscale, enhancing UV protection and formulation. In this study, 100-200 nm lignin nanoparticles (LNPs) were prepared from various biomass by-products (hardwood, softwood, and herbaceous material) using an eco-friendly anti-solvent precipitation method. Pure lignin macroparticles (LMPs) were extracted from beech, spruce, and wheat straw using an ethanol-organosolv treatment and compared with sulfur-rich kraft lignin (KL). Sunscreen lotions made from these LMPs and LNPs at various concentrations demonstrated novel UV-shielding properties based on biomass source and particle size. The results showed that transitioning from the macro- to nanoscale increased the sun protection factor (SPF) by at least 2.5 times, with the best results improving the SPF from 7.5 to 42 for wheat straw LMPs and LNPs at 5 wt%. This study underscores lignin's potential in developing high-quality green sunscreens, aligning with green chemistry principles."

Traditionally, it has been used for hemostasis therapy, as well as to treat sores, swelling and chapped skin. In this study, we used the ultraviolet (UV) absorbance rate of B. striata extracts as the index, and the extraction was varied with respect to the solid-liquid ratio, ethanol concentration, ultrasonic time and temperature in order to optimize the extraction process for its sunscreen components. The main compounds in the sunscreen ingredients of Baiji (B. striata) were analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography combined with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry. The sunscreen properties were subsequently evaluated in vitro using the 3M tape method. The results show that the optimal extraction conditions for the sunscreen components of B. striata were a solid-liquid ratio of 1:40 (g/mL), an ethanol concentration of 50%, an ultrasonic time of 50 min and a temperature of 60 °C. A power of 100 W and an ultrasonic frequency of 40 Hz were used throughout the experiments. Under these optimized conditions, the UV absorption rate of the isolated sunscreen components in the UVB region reached 84.38%, and the RSD was 0.11%. Eighteen compounds were identified, including eleven 2-isobutyl malic acid glucose oxybenzyl esters, four phenanthrenes, two bibenzyl and one α-isobutylmalic acid. An evaluation of the sunscreen properties showed that the average UVB absorption values for the sunscreen samples from different batches of B. striata ranged from 0.727 to 1.201. The sunscreen ingredients of the extracts from B. striata had a good UV absorption capacity in the UVB area, and they were effective in their sunscreen effects under medium-intensity sunlight. Therefore, this study will be an experimental reference for the extraction of sunscreen ingredients from the B. striata plant, and it provides evidence for the future development of B. striata as a candidate cosmetic raw material with UVB protection properties.",

Both CPDs and 6-4PPs were shown to last longer in blue-light irradiated RHE, proving the inhibition of the DNA repair by blue light exposure. This is a highly relevant information because sunscreens allow people to enjoy longer periods under the sun and consequently, to endure very high doses of blue light. The work also reported results obtained with RHEs previously treated with a sunscreen formulation containing a broadband filter that offers blue-light protection. Interestingly, authors observed that the DNA repair was not significantly inhibited in RHE previously treated with the sunscreen offering broadband protection. Readers will find a scientifically sound proof of the importance of blue-light protection in sun care products.",

However, present commercial sunscreens have a tendency to generate free radicals in the UV window, resulting in serious inflammatory responses and health problems. In this study, we demonstrate that silk fibroin microspheres (SFMPs) assembled from regenerated silk fibroin (SF) could scavenge free radicals while preventing UV irradiation and thus present a promising sunscreen. The SFMP reflected more UV light than SF and presented a higher stability than that of organic commercial sunscreens. In vitro analysis proved that SFMP could more efficiently scavenge the hydroxy radical and reduce the intracellular reactive oxygen than titanium dioxide (TiO2). In vivo experiments exhibited that SFMP provided stronger skin protection against UV irradiation than commercial sunscreens and TiO2. Furthermore, SFMP treatment significantly inhibited the skin inflammatory response. This work suggests that the SFMP has great potential to be developed into a biosafe sunscreen.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled trial of 51 patients aged 18 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris was conducted at the Hospital Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah, Universiti Putra Malaysia. The efficacy and tolerability of once-daily adapalene 1.0% were assessed during the 2-week run-in period. Subsequently, patients were randomized to receive either an add-on investigational LicA-containing sunscreen or niacinamide-containing comparator sunscreen every 4 hourly during daytime for 4 weeks. Patients were followed up at Weeks 2 and 4 to assess for improvement in acne severity, PAH, calorimetric parameters and cutaneous tolerability. RESULTS: Two weeks of adapalene usage significantly improved acne severity; however, up to 52% of patients experienced dryness, burning and stinging. Adding LicA-containing or comparator sunscreens was associated with further improvement in acne severity, PAH and calorimetric parameters at the study endpoint. No significant differences in the cutaneous tolerability profiles were observed between treatment groups. Notably, significantly fewer patients receiving LicA-containing sunscreen developed scaliness at Week 4 compared with those in the comparator group. In addition, more patients receiving LicA-containing sunscreen reported less dryness, burning and stinging reactions than the comparator group. Importantly, more patients receiving LicA-containing sunscreen agreed that their treatment led to excellent improvement than the comparator group; of note, one patient reported that their condition worsened with the receipt of the comparator product. CONCLUSION: The concurrent use of LicA-containing sunscreen with adapalene may improve the cutaneous tolerance to adapalene among Malaysian patients."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Long-term sun exposure is one of the risks faced by outdoor swimmers and can cause sunburn. Using sunscreen is one way to prevent sunburn; however, physical activity can trigger sweat, friction, and water washing that can interfere with sunscreen efficacy and decrease its sun protection factor (SPF). Sunscreens are classified into inorganic and organic based on their filter. Organic sunscreen has a better bond to the skin than inorganic sunscreen, which forms a barrier above the skin layer that makes removing it easier. Organic sunscreen lasts longer than inorganic sunscreen when used in physical activities, but it has a limited spectrum, is more photolabile, and is more allergenic. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the persistency of SPF 30 between inorganic and organic sunscreens on the back area after 1.5 hours of swimming. METHODS: This study is a randomized, split-body, double-blind clinical trial to evaluate the persistency of SPF 30 of the inorganic versus organic sunscreens in swimmers. Randomization was done to allocate the participants into treatment groups. Each participant received inorganic and organic sunscreen treatments applied to the back area. The research participants were swimmers from the Cikini swimming pool and Bina Taruna swimming pool, both in Jakarta, Indonesia. RESULTS: A total of 22 swimmers were enrolled in this study. The analysis showed no significant difference between the SPF of the two sunscreens before swimming (P=.22). After swimming, the SPF levels of both sunscreens decreased: the inorganic sunscreen decreased from a median of 27 (range 23-47) to 12.3 (range 8-19), and the organic sunscreen decreased from a median of 30 (range 24-47) to 9.9 (range 6-19), which was statistically significant (P<.001). When comparing the SPF of inorganic and organic sunscreens after swimming, there was a statistically significant difference in the decrease in SPF levels between the two groups (P=.02), which indicated a better SPF persistence for inorganic sunscreens when compared to organic sunscreens. CONCLUSIONS: There was a decrease in the SPF levels of inorganic and organic sunscreens after 1.5 hours of swimming, with better persistence in inorganic sunscreens compared to organic sunscreens.

The objective was to estimate the prevalence and predictors of sunscreen use among parents and their children. An observational cross-sectional study was conducted in April 2022. Parents who were visiting outpatient clinics at a university hospital in Al-Kharj city, Saudi Arabia, were invited to complete an online questionnaire. A total of 266 participants were included in the final analysis. The mean age of parents was 39.0 ± 8.9 years, and the mean age of children was 8.2 ± 3.2 years. The prevalence of sunscreen use was 38.7% in parents and 24.1% in their children. Females had higher sunscreen use than males in both parents (49.7% versus 7.2%, p < 0.001) and in children (31.9% versus 18.3%, p = 0.011). The most frequent sunburn protection measures practiced by children were wearing long-sleeved clothes (77.0%), sitting in the shade (70.6%), and wearing hats (39.2%). In multivariable analysis, predictors of sunscreen use in parents included female sex, history of sunburn, and sunscreen use by children. Independent predictors of sunscreen use in children included a history of sunburn, wearing hats, and practicing other sunburn protection measures on risky occasions, and sunscreen use in parents. Sunscreen use in parents and children in Saudi Arabia is still inadequate or limited. This calls for community/school intervention programs using educational activities and multimedia promotion. Further studies are needed."

      "abstract": "Background Although White individuals have higher incidence of melanoma, clinical outcomes are worse among patients with skin of color. This disparity arises from delayed diagnoses and treatment that are largely due to clinical and sociodemographic factors. Investigating this discrepancy is crucial to decrease melanoma-related mortality rates in minority communities. A survey was used to investigate the presence of racial disparities in perceived sun exposure risks and behaviors. Methods A survey consisting of 16 questions was deployed via social media to assess skin health knowledge. Over 350 responses were recorded, and the extracted data were analyzed using statistical software. Results Of the respondents, White patients were significantly more likely to have higher perceived risk of developing skin cancer, highest levels of sunscreen usage, and higher reported frequency of skin checks performed by primary care providers (PCPs). There was no difference between racial groups in the amount of education provided by PCPs related to sun exposure risks. Conclusion The survey findings suggest inadequate dermatologic health literacy as a result of other factors such as public health and sunscreen product marketing rather than as a consequence of inadequate dermatologic education provided in healthcare settings. Factors such as racial stereotypes in communities, implicit biases in marketing companies, and public health campaigns should be considered. Further studies should be conducted to determine these biases and improve education in communities of color."

Countries such as Europe have 30+ UV filters approved for sunscreen products while the US has about 10, greatly reducing the options to provide diverse, effective sun protection products. Bemotrizinol (BEMT) is the first new sunscreen active ingredient to be evaluated for inclusion in the Over-The-Counter (OTC) sunscreen monograph using FDA's new Generally Recognized as Safe and Effective (GRASE) testing guidelines. An in vitro skin permeation test (IVPT) and clinical pilot pharmacokinetic Maximum Usage Trial (MUsT) were completed to support the GRASE determination for 6% BEMT. IVPT results indicated an oil +10% ethanol as the model sunscreen intervention for the pilot MUsT. The open-label trial revealed: BEMT concentrations rarely exceeded FDA's defined threshold (0.5 ng/mL) in plasma; no evidence for BEMT accumulation or steady-state concentrations above threshold; only one moderate and few mild treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Therefore, maximal topical applications of 6% BEMT in a model sunscreen formulation did not contribute to meaningful systemic exposure. These results support the safety of BEMT 6% for human sunscreen use.",

Those who believed sunscreen use would prevent them from getting sunburned (odds ratio [OR]=1.84) and those who believed that their romantic partners thought they should use sunscreen (OR=1.72) were more likely to report sunscreen use. Those who believed sunscreen use would \"take too much time\" were less likely to report sunscreen use (OR=0.65).

For ethylene glycol-oxalic acid (EG-OA), more than 53 % of lignin was obtained and superb carbohydrate digestibility (i.e., glucose and xylose yields were reached to 94.6 % and 87.7 %, respectively) was achieved after pretreatment. Remarkably, detailed structural studies revealed that the polyol was incorporated into lignin, which stabilized reactive carbocation intermediates formed during BDESs treatment and prevented undesired recondensation reactions. This lignin protection mechanism was shown to play a key role in enzymatic hydrolysis enhancement and lignin valorization. The resultant β-O-4 linkage-rich lignin fractions were attractive for natural sunscreen applications due to their lighter color and excellent UV-blocking performance. Overall, this work proposed a sustainable and economically practical lignin-first biorefinery approach that is beneficial for achieving comprehensive valorization of lignocellulose.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Outdoor workers (OW) receive a higher dose of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) compared to indoor workers (IW) which increases the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Regular sunscreen use reduces the NMSC risk, however, adequate sun-safety behavior among OW is poor. The main objective was to conduct method- and intervention-related elements of a future intervention trial among OW, based on providing sunscreen and assessing sunscreen use on group- and individual level. METHODS: This pilot study was conducted at a construction site in the Netherlands from May-August 2021. Nine dispensers with sunscreen (SPF 50+) were installed at the worksite. OW (n = 67) were invited to complete two (cross-sectional) questionnaires on sun-safety behavior, before and after providing sunscreen. Stratum corneum (SC) samples for the assessment of UV-biomarkers were collected from the forehead and behind the ear from 15 OW and 15 IW. The feasibility of the following elements was investigated: recruitment, (loss to) follow-up, outcome measures, data collection, and acceptability of the intervention. RESULTS: The first questionnaire was completed by 27 OW, the second by 17 OW. More than 75 percent of the OW were aware of the risks of sun exposure, and 63% (n = 17) found sunscreen use during worktime important. The proportion of OW never applying sunscreen in the past month was 44.4% (n = 12) before, and 35.3% (n = 6) after providing sunscreen. A majority of OW (59.3%, n = 16) found sunscreen provision encouraging for sunscreen use, the dispensers easy to use (64.7%, n = 17) and placed in practical spots (58.8%, n = 18). Collecting SC-samples was fast and easy, and several UV-biomarkers showed higher levels for sun-exposed compared to less exposed body parts. There was no significant difference in UV-biomarker levels between OW and IW. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study revealed low sunscreen use among OW despite providing sunscreen, overall satisfaction with the sunscreen, and the sufficient awareness of the risks of UVR-exposure. Collecting SC-samples at the workplace is feasible and several UV-biomarkers showed to be promising in assessing UVR-exposure. The low participation rate and high loss to follow-up poses a challenge for future intervention studies.",

In general, regular UV filters are beneficial in preventing PIH, but the comparison with sunscreen containing anti-inflammatory ingredients remains unexplored. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of a sunscreen with anti-inflammatory agent (sunscreen A) in the reduction of PIH after a picosecond laser with that of regular sunscreen (sunscreen B). METHODS: Fifty-nine acne vulgaris and acne scar patients with skin phototypes III and IV were treated with 1 session of picosecond laser with the microlens array to the whole face. Sunscreens A and B were randomized to be applied on either side of the face. Hyperpigmentation assessed by brown score mode on Visia®, acne quantity, porphyrins and patient satisfaction were evaluated at baseline, weeks 1, 2, 4 and 6. RESULTS: Sunscreen A caused a higher reduction of the brown score compared to the other side but there was no statistically significant difference. Interestingly, a significant decrease of inflammatory acne lesions compared with baseline was observed as early as week 2 on the sunscreen A side (weeks 2, 4 and 6; P = 0.017, P = <0.001, and P = <0.001, respectively). Compared with sunscreen B, levels of porphyrins on sunscreen A side were significantly less at weeks 1 and 6 (weeks 1 and 6; P = 0.022 and P = 0.029, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a tendency towards lower post-laser pigmentation when the sunscreen with anti-inflammatory agents was applied. This product also had an effective outcome as an adjunctive treatment option of acne vulgaris.

We sought to investigate patients' perspectives and behaviors toward sunscreen usage. METHODS: A cross-sectional hospital-based study targeted 418 melasma patients from May 2019 to May 2021. Data regarding socio-demographic characteristics and the knowledge, attitude, and behavior toward sunscreen and sun exposure were collected and analyzed. Furthermore, a complete clinical assessment was done. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 35.4 ± 8.6 years. Melasma distribution was mostly centro-facial (49.8%). The mean duration of the disease was 22.3 ± 11.6 months, with a mean Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI) score of 18.6 ± 8.9. Only 170 patients believed that sun exposure played a role in their disease. Skin darkening was the most recognized effect of sun exposure by 92.9% of participants. 58.6% reported using sunscreen with a higher female predominance (p < .001), while males reported more broad-spectrum sunscreen usage (p < .001). The reason that was reported the most behind not using sunscreen was the high cost (94%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed a sound level of knowledge regarding the effects of sun exposure, and sunscreen advantages and disadvantages, with relatively inadequate translation into their attitudes and practices regarding sun-protective behaviors.

OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the efficacy of using sunscreen with photolyase compared to regular sunscreen, as well as to compare the combination of a topical formulation of antioxidants versus placebo in the treatment of advanced photodamage. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, factorial clinical trial. Participants with AKs on their forearms were randomized to apply regular sunscreen (SC) or sunscreen with photolyase (SC+P) on both forearms during the day. One of the forearms in each group was randomized again to receive topical antioxidants (AOx), and the other forearm received a placebo cream (both for night application). The four groups were SC/AOx, SC/placebo, SC+P/AOx, and SC+P/placebo. The duration of treatment was 8 weeks. Primary outcomes were total AK clearance, decrease in Forearm Photoaging Scale (FPS), and AK severity scores. Secondary outcomes were reduction in AK count, partial clearance rate, and safety. RESULTS: Forty participants (80 forearms) were included. All groups showed significant improvement in outcomes at week eight. There were no significant differences between SC and SC+P for either outcome. AOx led to a significant reduction in AK count (22%; p < 0.05). Partial clearance was obtained in 18 (47.4%) forearms treated with AOx and in 9 (23.7%) treated with placebo (p < 0.05). All groups reduced the FPS score, without significant differences among them. CONCLUSIONS: There is no difference in the treatment of advanced photodamage skin when comparing the use of sunscreen with photolyase and regular sunscreen, and topical antioxidants were more efficient in reducing AK count than placebo. STUDY LIMITATIONS: Short interval of follow-up and absence of re-evaluation in the absence of treatment were limitations of the present study.",

      "abstract": "A new method was developed for the in vitro sun protection factor (SPF) evaluation of sunscreen samples. A new type of substrate, a hydroxyalkyl cellulose-coated plate, was also prepared specifically for hydrophilic samples. This new substrate was required because hydrophilic samples would be unlikely to wet the surface of the standard cosmetic PMMA UV evaluation plate. A super-hydrophilic quartz plate was prepared by corona-discharge treatment before an aqueous solution of hydroxyalkyl cellulose was spread on it. A flat and uniform hydroxyalkyl cellulose film was subsequently formed through the evaporation of water. Special care was taken to inhibit the generation of spatial non-uniformity. Six hydrophilic sunscreen samples with in vivo SPF values of 56, 55, 52, 25, 15, and 4, were then applied to the prepared hydroxyalkyl cellulose-coated plate, as well as a super-hydrophilic quartz plate and a flat hydrophobic PMMA plate. The thicknesses of the applied layers were determined using a wheel-shaped wet film thickness gauge immediately after the application, and UV transmission was measured using an SPF analyzer. The value of in vitro SPF was calculated from the UV absorbance and the thickness of the layer. For two out of the six samples, PMMA plate could not be available, as the samples were unable to wet the PMMA surface. Relatively small differences were observed between the in vitro SPF values when the super-hydrophilic and hydroxyalkyl cellulose-coated plates were used. Samples exhibiting higher in vivo SPF were also associated with higher in vitro SPF values, although a linear relationship was not observed. In contrast to the super-hydrophilic plate whose half-life of the super-hydrophilicity is only approximately five days, the hydrophilicity of the hydroxyalkyl cellulose-coated plate scarcely varied during six months of storage. Finally, a simplified evaluation method was also proposed. The validity of the method was verified through a ring test where three researchers employed this method in different laboratories at three independent organizations.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Chlorphenesin is an approved biocide frequently used in cosmetics, and its carbamate ester is an approved skeletal muscle relaxant in certain countries for the treatment of discomfort related to skeletal muscle trauma and inflammation. A major urinary metabolite is 4-chlorophenoxy acetic acid (4-CPA), also known as para-chlorophenoxyacetate, which is also employed as a target analyte in sports drug testing to detect the use of the prohibited nootropic stimulant meclofenoxate. To distinguish between 4-CPA resulting from chlorphenesin, chlorphenesin carbamate, and meclofenoxate, urinary metabolite profiles of chlorphenesin after legitimate use were investigated. METHODS: Human administration studies with commercially available sunscreen containing 0.25% by weight of chlorphenesin were conducted. Six study participants dermally applied 8 g of sunscreen and collected urine samples before and up to 7 days after application. Another set of six study participants applied 8 g of sunscreen on three consecutive days, and urine samples were also taken for up to 5 days after the last dosing. Urine specimens were analyzed using liquid chromatography-high resolution (tandem) mass spectrometry, and urinary metabolites were identified in accordance with literature data by accurate mass analysis of respective precursor and characteristic product ions. RESULTS: In accordance with literature data, chlorphenesin yielded the characteristic urinary metabolites, chlorphenesin glucuronide, chlorphenesin sulfate, and 3-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2-hydroxypropanoic acid (4-CPP), as well as the common metabolite 4-CPA. 4-CPA and 4-CPP were observed at similar abundances, with urinary concentrations of 4-CPA reaching up to ~1500 and 2300 ng/mL after single and multiple sunscreen applications, respectively. CONCLUSION: 4-CPA is a common metabolite of meclofenoxate, chlorphenesin, and chlorphenesin carbamate. Monitoring the diagnostic urinary metabolites of chlorphenesin provides conclusive supporting evidence of whether chlorphenesin or the prohibited nootropic meclofenoxate was administered.",

In vitro analysis in dermal fibroblasts and their biological mechanisms involved are critical to determine antiaging potential. The study aimed to investigate the antiaging potential of sunscreen formulated from nanostructured lipid carrier and tocotrienol-rich fraction (NLC-TRF sunscreen). The antioxidant activity of the NLC-TRF sunscreen was evaluated by radical scavenging and hydrogen peroxide inhibition properties. Also, collagenase, elastase and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) inhibition activities, and type I collagen and elastin protein expression were studied. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to evaluate the mRNA expression of fibroblast growth factor (FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), type I collagen (COL1A1), elastin (ELN), MMP-1, MMP-2, and tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1). The results suggested that NLC-TRF sunscreen is effective in radical, anti-hydrogen peroxide, and collagenase, elastase and MMP-1 inhibition activities. Besides, a significant increase for type I collagen (3.47-fold) and elastin (2.16-fold) protein and fibroblast regeneration genes (FGF (2.12-fold), VEGF (1.91-fold), TGF-β1 (2.84-fold), TIMP-1 (1.42-fold), ELN (2.13-fold)) were observed after sample treatment. These findings support the therapeutic potential of NLC-TRF sunscreen in antiaging.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Melasma is the commonest cause of facial hypermelanosis in skin type IV-VI. First-line treatment includes a triple combination containing topical corticosteroid and hydroquinone which have side effects on prolonged use. Chemical peels are a second-line management option with the laser being used in refractory cases, but the worsening of hyperpigmentation in darker skin types can occur following laser therapy. Sunscreen is a must to prevent relapses. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: (i) To compare the effects of treatment with a proprietary combination (phenyl ethyl resorcinol, nonapeptide-1, aminoethyl phosphinic acid, antioxidants and sunscreen) versus sunscreen alone in limiting or reducing, melasma and preventing recurrence as a maintenance regimen after the initial use of triple combination,(ii) to evaluate the safety of the formulation studied, and (iii) to study the improvement of the quality of life of the patients after using the study formulation versus placebo. METHODS: It was a prospective double-blinded parallel-group randomized controlled pilot study. A total of 46 subjects were recruited by consecutive sampling methods and randomized to 23 each in case and control groups. The study period was eight months with three phases. Phase 1 constituted the application of triple combination for eight weeks by both groups followed by phase 2 with the case group applying proprietary medicine and the control group applying sunscreen. Phase 3 was a follow-up period to see the sustenance of results in both groups as well as any evidence of relapses. Sunscreen was applied in all three phases. RESULTS: Case group in the study showed improvement in the melasma severity score and mean melanin index as measured by mexameter but it did not attain statistical significance as compared to the control group. The melasma area and severity index score showed a consistent reduction in the case group, whereas it increased in the control group from baseline. LIMITATIONS: Small sample size and a short follow-up period of our study were major limitations. CONCLUSION: The proprietary combination, which has sunscreen as one of its constituents, is more effective in maintaining remission after triple combination without any added inconvenience of application of two separate preparations as compared to sunscreen alone.",

      "abstract": "Control of powder alignment is essential for maximizing the functionality of color cosmetics and sunscreens. Various surface treatments were applied to nanosized titanium dioxide to modify their surface characteristics. Such modifications can be used to control the behavior of dispersions in cosmetics, enabling them to align uniformly. The powders were mixed with solvents and applied to a cellulose triacetate film. The features of powder alignment on the film were evaluated using several approaches. When the type of surface treatment changed by varying the weight ratio, there was no significant correlation between its alignment and treatment. However, when we focused on the pseudo-HLB each treated pigment, their alignments were correlated. It was confirmed that the powders subjected to the appropriate surface treatment combinations from the pseudo-HLB standpoint made it possible to align uniformly and create a smooth coating film. As a result, it has a high UV-shielding ability. The surface-treated powders in this study were found to change the UV shielding ability and surface roughness of the layer formed when they were formed by spreading the sample powder dispersion and drying of the film. It was suggested that the pseudoHLB, which is calculated based on the chemical structure after the surface treatment process, is useful for choosing the optimum surface treatment to create a uniformly aligned pigment layer.",

The majority of lifetime UVR exposure occurs before age 20, underscoring an important window for risk reduction. Incorporation of skills-based sunscreen education into school health curricula may foster the development of consistent and effective use of sunscreen among children and youth. We describe the study protocol for a first-of-its-kind study that examined the feasibility of bringing skills-based sunscreen education into kindergarten classrooms. METHODS: Participants were 96 kindergarten students across four classrooms in a single elementary school. A single-blind open-label trial design was used to evaluate the feasibility of incorporating a song-based, video-guided intervention for independent application of sunscreen into the kindergarten curriculum. Students first completed a 10-day no-intervention baseline period, followed by a 10-day intervention period, and then a 10-day randomized follow-up period where students were randomly assigned to continue with the intervention or to revert to the no-intervention condition. OUTCOMES: Feasibility metrics associated with study process, resources, management, scientific outcomes and safety were gathered. The primary outcome was pre-to-post intervention changes in student engagement in the sunscreen task. The secondary outcome was pre-to-post intervention changes in the proportion of exposed skin to which a student applies sunscreen. Teacher and student perceptions of intervention value and utility were also evaluated. DISCUSSION: This is the study protocol for a clinical trial designed to determine the feasibility of implementing a skills-based sunscreen curriculum in kindergarten classrooms. Next steps include evaluation of the intervention for efficacy and effectiveness. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03752736.",

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the differences between the physical and the physical-chemical sunscreen application after microneedling, assessed through histological analysis. METHOD: This was a two-phase study. The first phase investigated the physical and physical-chemical sunscreen penetration mixed with India ink through histological analysis. The sunscreens were applied after the microleakage in vivo on the skin of a volunteer who underwent abdominoplasty 24 hours after the procedure. Histological analyses were carried out using optical and electron microscopy. The second phase analysed the skin reactions with the use of physical sunscreen after different microneedling treatments. The sample consisted of 30 volunteers distributed into three groups: G1 received the \"Roller\" microneedling, G2 received pen micropuncture treatment, and G3 received the fractional radiofrequency treatment. RESULTS: The histological analyses of the first phase indicated that the physical-chemical protection sunscreen penetrated more deeply, and pigment was found among the collagen fibres and the dermal fibroblast cytoplasm in comparison to the physical protection sunscreen, which had the pigment confined exclusively in the superficial epidermis layer. The second phase results demonstrated that the use of the physical protection sunscreen after the different microneedling techniques showed no adverse reactions such as itching, pain or soreness, and the hyperaemia. CONCLUSION: The proposed intervention showed that the use of physical protection sunscreen after different microneedling procedures is safe.",

Given their worldwide dissemination and the scarcity of studies on marine fish, we evaluated the toxicity of an organic (oxybenzone) and an inorganic (titanium dioxide nanoparticles) UV filter, individually and in a binary mixture, in the turbot (Scophthalmus maximus). Fish were intraperitoneally injected and a multi-level assessment was carried out 3 and 7 days later. Oxybenzone and titanium dioxide nanoparticles induced mild effects on turbot, both isolated and in mixture. Neither oxidative stress (intestine, liver and kidney) nor neurotoxicity (brain) was found. However, liver metabolic function was altered after 7 days, suggesting the impairment of the aerobic metabolism. An increased motility rate in oxybenzone treatment was the only behavioural alteration (day 7). The intestine and liver were preferentially targeted, while kidney and brain were unaffected. Both infra- and supra-additive interactions were perceived, with a toxicodynamic nature, resulting either in favourable or unfavourable toxicological outcomes, which were markedly dependent on the organ, parameter and post-injection time. The combined exposure to the UV filters did not show a consistent increment in toxicity in comparison with the isolated exposures, which is an ecologically relevant finding providing key information towards the formulation of environmentally safe sunscreen products.",

Nanoparticle sunscreen was used as a model to test toxicity based on oxidative stress using microbiopsy and confocal imaging. METHODS: Six volunteers were recruited for this study (3 males and 3 females). Zinc oxide nanoparticle containing topical formulation was prepared at 10% w/v. Each volunteer had 3 areas of 4 cm2 each mapped on each inner forearm for a total of 6 treatment areas (intact/ tape-stripped and with/without treatment). The topical zinc-nanoparticle formulation was applied directly to volunteer skin (2mg/cm2 ) for 2 hrs. Microbiopsied tissue from each treatment group was stained for reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in addition to mitochondrial superoxide. The stained samples were then imaged using confocal microscopy prior to image analysis. RESULTS: Skin exposed to zinc oxide nanoparticles did not show any significant increases in oxidative stress. Zinc oxide nanoparticle tape-stripped skin resulted in signal significantly lower (P < 0.001) oxidative stress levels than t-butylated hydroxytoluene treated tape-stripped skin for oxidative stress markers. Topically applied zinc oxide nanoparticles had no detectable effect on the oxidative status in volunteer skin. No adverse reactions or effects were observed after all treatments including microbiopsy. CONCLUSION: The data support the hypothesis that microbiopsy is a viable approach to study cosmeceutical- skin interactions in volunteers with capacity for molecular assays and high throughput with very low risk to the volunteer.",

      "abstract": "Scytonemin is a yellow-green ultraviolet sunscreen pigment present in different genera of aquatic and terrestrial blue-green algae, including marine cyanobacteria. In the present study, the anti-inflammatory activities of scytonemin were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Topical application of scytonemin inhibited 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced ear swelling in BALB/c mice. The expression of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was also suppressed by scytonemin treatment in the TPA-treated ear of BALB/c mice. In addition, scytonemin inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of TNF-a and nitric oxide (NO) in RAW 264.7 cells, a murine macrophage-like cell line, and the mRNA expressions of TNF-a and iNOS were also suppressed by scytonemin in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Further study demonstrated that LPS-induced NF-kB activity was significantly suppressed by scytonemin treatment in RAW 264.7 cells. Our results also showed that the degradation of IkBa and nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit were blocked by scytonemin in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Collectively, these results suggest that scytonemin inhibits skin inflammation by blocking the expression of inflammatory mediators, and the anti-inflammatory effect of scytonemin is mediated, at least in part, by down-regulation of NF-kB activity. Our results also suggest that scytonemin might be used as a multi-function skin care ingredient for UV protection and anti-inflammation.",

      "abstract": "Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi is a well-known medicinal plant native of South America. This species has demonstrated important biological activities such as antihypertensive and vasodilator, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. However, no studies have been, so far, reported with the fruits of S. terebinthifolius as a protector of the placenta against Zika virus infection and as sunscreen agents. The present study aimed to investigate new uses for the ethanolic fruit extracts of S. terebinthifolius, from fruits'peel (STPE) and from the whole fruits (STWFE). Zika virus (ZIKV) has been linked to several fetal malformations, such as microcephaly and other central nervous system abnormalities. Thus, the potential of these natural extracts against ZIKV infection was evaluated, using an in vitro method. The photoprotective potential, determined by spectrometry, along with phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, and chemical composition of both extracts were also evaluated. The chemical composition of the extracts was evaluated by HPLC-UV / vis. The cytotoxicity of peel and whole fruit extracts in vero E6 cell lines, in placental cell lines and placental explant cultures were evaluated by the MTT assay. The infectivity of placental cells and explants was evaluated by qRT-PCR and the effects of extracts on ZIKV infection were investigated using HTR-8/SVneo cells, pre-treated with 100 μg mL-1 of STWFE for 1 h, and infected with MR766 (AD) or PE243 (EH) ZIKV strains. STFE and STWFE were well-tolerated by both placental-derived trophoblast cell line HTR-8/SVneo as well as by term placental chorionic villi explants, which indicate absence of cytotoxicity in all analysed concentrations. Two strains of ZIKV were tested to access if pre-treatment of trophoblast cells with the STWFE would protect them against infection. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that STWFE extract greatly reduced ZIKV infection. The extracts were also photoprotective with SPF values equivalent to the standard, benzophenone-3. The formulations prepared in different concentrations of the extracts (5-10 %) had shown maximum SPF values of 32.21. STWFE represents a potential natural mixture to be used in pregnancy in order to restrain placental infection by ZIKV and might potentially protect fetus against ZIKV-related malformations. The extracts exhibited photoprotective activity and some of the phenolic compounds, mainly resveratrol, catechin and epicatechin, are active ingredients in all assayed activities. The development of biotechnological/medical products, giving extra value to products from family farming, is expected, with strong prospects for success."

We aimed to evaluate the body of literature to provide evidence for the use of sunscreen in the treatment of melasma and PIH. We reviewed English articles from PubMed, Journals@Ovid Full Text, and Embase using the search terms \"sunscreen\" and either \"melasma\" \"PIH,\" or \"post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.\" Nine relevant publications provide evidence that a broad spectrum of protection, including UVA, UVB, and visible light within sunscreens can play an adjuvant role in therapy for melasma and PIH by stabilizing and improving these pigmentary disorders in skin of color patients. This review illustrates the advantages and limitations of sunscreen use, as well as practice gaps in photoprotection in the skin of color patients with melasma and PIH."

      "abstract": "Oxybenzone (OBZ), avobenzone (AVB), octocrylene (OCR) and octinoxate (OMC) are ultraviolet (UV) filters commonly added to chemical sunscreens. These UV filters are known to widely contaminate the environment through a variety of anthropogenic sources, including sewage discharge. However, systematic studies of the damage caused by these four UV filters and their toxicopathological differences in a variety of plant species are lacking. In this study, we demonstrated that irrigation with water containing these four UV filters could significantly inhibit the aboveground growth of cucumber plant. All of the UV filters decreased photosynthesis through nonstomatal factors but via different inhibitory mechanisms. Only OBZ inhibited photosynthesis by directly inhibiting photosynthetic electron transport, while the other three (AVB, OCR, and OMC) inhibited photosynthesis by inhibiting the Calvin-Benson cycle. Additionally, these four UV filters also decreased plant respiration under long-term treatment. Photosynthesis and respiration inhibition led to the over production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the formation of lipid peroxidation damage products, which further damaged the structure and function of plant cells, causing secondary pathologies and potentially leading to reduced crop yields. The study also demonstrated that these four UV filters caused different degrees of phototoxic damage to cucumber plants. On the basis of comprehensive evaluation, we speculated that the order of the four UV filters in terms of plant damage was OBZ > AVB > OMC > OCR. Because of the severe damaging effects of these UV filters on plant growth, the application of contaminated biosolids/reclaimed water in agriculture reduces agricultural production and may damage ecosystems. The results of this study can advance recognition of the hazards associated with environmental and agricultural pollution via UV filters and encourage consumers and the industry to limit or reduce the application of cosmetics and over-the-counter drugs containing these substances.",

      "abstract": "Drug manufacturers are expected to provide labeling information needed to yield safe and effective product use. However, it is not clear that consumers dose sunscreen, an over-the-counter drug, appropriately; in fact, existing evidence suggests underdosing as a common phenomenon. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of dispensing device and labeling on self-administered doses of sunscreen in young adults. To investigate those effects, a 2 × 2 factorial laboratory experiment crossing dispensing device (two levels) with labeling treatment (two levels) was conducted. Participants applied sunscreen from each of the four treatments; dosing concentration, measured in mg/cm2, served as the response variable. Participants (n = 94) were recruited on the campuses of Michigan State University (East Lansing, MI) and California Polytechnic State University (San Luis Obispo, CA). Each participant applied sunscreen from each unique treatment to sites on their arms and legs (four applications). Postapplication, a survey was completed to characterize demographics, risk perception, and sunscreen use patterns. Results indicate participants applied approximately 30% less sunscreen from the pump bottles than the squeeze bottles (difference estimate of 0.3059 mg/cm2, standard error = 0.0607, p < .0001); there was no evidence of a difference based on label treatments. Post hoc recognition tests indicated only 55% of participants were able to recognize the two experimental labels they had viewed immediately following sunscreen application. Sunscreen application density was directly related to level of worry regarding skin cancer and frequency of sunscreen use (α = .05). Our results suggest the dispensing device used to deliver sunscreen impacts the dosage amount consumers apply.",

There is evidence pointing to lack awareness and misconceptions regarding use of Sunscreen. This is especially evident in populations with skin of color (POC). METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of 2000 individuals. A structured questionnaire was designed to collect data on general knowledge and use of sunscreen as well as reasons for stopping use of sunscreen. RESULTS: The results of this study indicate a clear deficiency in the use and knowledge about sunscreen among Jordanians. Females are using sunscreen more than males. However, the use of sunscreen is inadequate in many aspects including timing of application, frequency of use, and amount used among other things. There is an obvious lack of knowledge about sunscreen as shown by lack of awareness about benefits of use in various times of the year, use in children, use for all skin types, and several misconceptions among other knowledge gaps. Main reasons for stopping sunscreen include side effects, cost, and being not suitable for skin. Awareness about sunscreen can be improved by proper counseling by healthcare professionals and utilization of various media platforms. CONCLUSIONS: The use of sunscreen is inadequate in this population of color (POC). Lack of proper counseling, failure to read use instructions can contibute to inadequate use of sunscreen. Risks and benefits of sunscreen should be explained by medical professionals. The media should be more utilized to disseminate such knowledge.",

The anti-inflammatory drug piroxicam can counteract photocarcinogenesis and photoaging by blocking cyclooxygenases-1 and 2, matrix metalloproteinases, and ornithine decarboxylase, and inducing apoptosis. METHODS: We conducted an open observational study in 50 adults with moderate to severe signs of photoaging treated with a new local formulation of piroxicam 0.8% plus sunscreen for 16 weeks. Photoaging was assessed using a validated dermoscopic photoaging scale. Each patient’s own perception of their skin quality was assessed using a graphic scale. RESULTS: The new formulation demonstrated a reliable effect on photoaging after 16 weeks, based on improved median dermoscopic photoaging and skin-quality scores. No patients experienced any adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence for the safe and effective use of a local piroxicam formulation for the treatment of moderate to severe photoaging.",

OBJECTIVE: To recognize the expression and DNA methylation of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in malar melasma and perilesional skin, as well as the changes in DNMTs after their treatment with sunscreen in combination with 4% niacinamide, 0.05% retinoic acid, or placebo. METHODS: Thirty female patients were clinically evaluated for the expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3b using real-time PCR and immunofluorescence. These initial results were compared to results after eight weeks of treatment with sunscreen in combination with niacinamide, retinoic acid, or placebo. RESULTS: The relative expression of DNMT1 was significantly elevated in melasma compared with unaffected skin in all subjects, indicating DNA hypermethylation. After treatment, it was decreased in all groups: niacinamide (7 versus 1; p<0.01), retinoic acid (7 versus 2; p<0.05), and placebo (7 versus 3; p<0.05), which correlates with clinical improvement. DNMT3b was not overexpressed in lesional skin but reduced in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: We found DNA hypermethylation in melasma lesions. Environmental factors such as solar radiation may induce cellular changes that trigger hyperpigmentation through the activation of pathways regulated by epigenetic modifications. However, limiting or decreasing DNA methylation through sunscreen, niacinamide, and retinoic acid treatments that provide photoprotection and genetic transcription can counteract this.",

In this context, the development of innovative and more effective sunscreens, with bioactive compounds like caffeine, displaying antioxidant and anticancer potential, is required. This research work assessed in vitro and in vivo the efficacy and safety of topical sunscreen formulations containing caffeine as an adjuvant of the UV filters. Sunscreens were prepared with 2.5% w/w caffeine or in the absence of this compound. In order to evaluate the safety of these formulations, stratum corneum hydration, skin barrier and colorimetry were assessed in vivo in healthy subjects before and after skin treatment with the samples. The efficacy of the sunscreens was assessed in vitro, using PMMA plates and a spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere; and in vivo by the determination of the sun protection factor (SPF). None of the formulations caused erythema or impaired the skin barrier function. The in vitro functional characterization showed higher SPF values for the caffeine formulation. The in vivo studies also confirmed the higher SPF value of the formulation combining caffeine with the filters, compared to the caffeine-free sample. This improvement contributed to an increase of, approximately, 25% in the in vivo anti-UVB protection. In conclusion, caffeine was well tolerated by the skin and increased the photoprotective activity, being a new alternative adjuvant in sunscreens formulation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sunlight contains ultraviolet (UV)A and UVB radiation. UVB is essential for vitamin D synthesis but is the main cause of sunburn and skin cancer. Sunscreen use is advocated to reduce the sun's adverse effects but may compromise vitamin D status. OBJECTIVES: To assess the ability of two intervention sunscreens to inhibit vitamin D synthesis during a week-long sun holiday. METHODS: The impact of sunscreens on vitamin D status was studied during a 1-week sun holiday in Tenerife (28° N). Comparisons were made between two formulations, each with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15. The UVA-protection factor (PF) was low in one case and high in the other. Healthy Polish volunteers (n = 20 per group) were given the sunscreens and advised on the correct application. Comparisons were also made with discretionary sunscreen use (n = 22) and nonholiday groups (51·8° N, n = 17). Sunscreen use in the intervention groups was measured. Behaviour, UV radiation exposure, clothing cover and sunburn were monitored. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3 ] was assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Use of intervention sunscreens was the same (P = 0·60), and both equally inhibited sunburn, which was present in the discretionary use group. There was an increase (P < 0·001) in mean ± SD 25(OH)D3 (28·0 ± 16·5 nmol L-1 ) in the discretionary use group. The high and low UVA-PF sunscreen groups showed statistically significant increases (P < 0·001) of 19·0 ± 14·2 and 13·0 ± 11·4 nmol L-1 25(OH)D3 , respectively with P = 0·022 for difference between the intervention sunscreens. The nonholiday group showed a fall (P = 0·08) of 2·5 ± 5·6 nmol L-1 25(OH)D3 . CONCLUSIONS: Sunscreens may be used to prevent sunburn yet allow vitamin D synthesis. A high UVA-PF sunscreen enables significantly higher vitamin D synthesis than a low UVA-PF sunscreen because the former, by default, transmits more UVB than the latter. What's already known about this topic? Action spectra (wavelength dependence) for erythema and the cutaneous formation of vitamin D overlap considerably in the ultraviolet (UV)B region. Theoretically, sunscreens that inhibit erythema should also inhibit vitamin D synthesis. To date, studies on the inhibitory effects of sunscreens on vitamin D synthesis have given conflicting results, possibly, in part, because people typically apply sunscreen suboptimally. Many studies have design flaws. What does this study add? Sunscreens (sun protection factor, SPF 15) applied at sufficient thickness to inhibit sunburn during a week-long holiday with a very high UV index still allow a highly significant improvement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 concentration. An SPF 15 formulation with high UVA protection enables better vitamin D synthesis than a low UVA protection product. The former allows more UVB transmission.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sunscreens have long been an indispensable part in treating melasma as ancillary agents. None of previous studies have evaluated the role of sunscreens alone in the improvement of melasma. AIMS: Our objective was to study the role of broad-spectrum sunscreen with sun protection factor 19 and PA+++ as the sole agent for improvement of melasma. METHODS: A total of 100 patients with melasma were included in the study. Following proper method of application of 3 mL sunscreen, thrice daily, Melasma Area Severity Score (MASI) and Hindi language version of the MELASQOL scale (Hi-MELAQOL) was done at baseline and 12 weeks. RESULTS: The mean MASI in the study group at the beginning and at the end of the study was 12.38 ± 14.7 and 9.15 ± 4.7, respectively, whereas the mean value of Hi-MELASQOL at the beginning and at the end of the study was 47.2 ± 14 and 38.1 ± 14.2, respectively. The differences of both were statistically significant. Spearman's correlation between MASI and Hi-MELASQOL before and after the study was positive but insignificant. CONCLUSION: There was both an objective and subjective improvement in melasma after 12 weeks of sunscreen use in terms of both MASI, showing an objective improvement of melasma after using sunscreens alone and also in Hi-MELASQOL showing that use of sunscreens significantly improved quality of life of melasma patients. In our study, we have attempted to re-instate the importance of sunscreens to patients and dermatologists who are inclining more toward various skin lightening agents for treatment of melasma, which have many side effects.",

In order to address this issue, the color of lignin was whitened by facile and economical approach via solvent fractionation and follow-up acetylation. After the two-step treatment, the color of lignin was highly lightened by 313.5% owing to the separation of dark-colored condensed structures and the blocking of free hydroxyls. The UV absorbability of the light-colored lignin was investigated, which indicated that the UV absorbance of the light-colored lignin are not as strong as commercial sunscreen actives under certain wavelengths, however it presented broad-spectrum absorbability and obvious synergistic effects with the commercial sunscreen actives. Based on that, lignin-based sunscreen was prepared by blending light-colored lignin with an SPF15 lotion, and the SPF of the as-prepared lignin sunscreen was boosted from 15.3 to 75.2 under a lignin addition amount of 8%. The as-prepared lignin sunscreen is stable enough under UV irradiation and exhibits outstanding color performance, which make it possible to satisfy the daily requirement of consumers. Briefly, an effective approach was demonstrated in this work to prepare light-colored lignin, which makes lignin a green alternative to replace synthetic sunscreen actives and imparts lignin potentials in cosmetics applications.",

      "abstract": "Background: Poor ocular tolerance of sunscreens is partially responsible for poor compliance in use of sunscreens. A three-tiered approach for the testing of ocular tolerance for such products is described that includes an in vitro test for ocular irritation, an in vitro test for the activation of pain receptors, and finally a clinical study involving ocular instillation of the product under controlled conditions followed by ophthalmologic and subjective self-evaluation on a graded scale. We report the results for a new water-based facial sunscreen (SCFW) with very good ocular tolerance. Methods: The ocular irritation potential of SCFW was determined using the EpiOcular™ human cell construct which constituted the first-tier testing. Briefly, the tissues were exposed to SCFW and appropriate positive and negative controls for 15 minutes to 24 hours. After treatment, the tissues were rinsed and cytotoxicity determined. The calculated ET50 value (time at which relative viability decreased 50%) was then used to determine the ocular irritation potential. In the second-tier testing, the sting potential of SCFW was determined by employing the NociOcular assay that measures the activation of TRPV1 (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1) specific receptors linked to pain sensation in a neuronal model with over-expression of functional TRPV1 channels. Finally, as the third-tier testing, SCFW was tested in a clinical study with instillation of product into the ocular cul-de-sac and ocular irritation was evaluated after 30 seconds, 15 minutes, and 60 minutes by an ophthalmologist. Participating subjects were also asked to score sensation on a scale of 0 to 3 from slight prickliness to severe stinging. Assay control reference product with known good ocular tolerability (10% baby shampoo) was concurrently tested. Results: In the in vitro topical application assay using the EpiOcular™ construct, no significant cytotoxicity was observed in the tissues exposed to SCFW, indicating minimal ocular irritation potential. In the in vitro NociOcular assay, the cells exposed to the prepared dilutions of SCFW showed minimal TRPV1 specific activity, indicating minimal ocular sting potential. In the in vivo study, no statistically significant differences were found in terms of subjective or objective eye irritation assessment between SCFW and 10% baby shampoo. Conclusion: SCFW showed negligible ocular irritation potential in tier 1, minimal potential to activate pain receptors in tier 2, and good ocular tolerability that was comparable to 10% baby shampoo in tier 3 testing. The results suggest that SCFW has good eye tolerance and that the tiered approach can be used to evaluate facial sunscreens for ocular tolerability.",

The objective of this study was to assess the protective effect of this formulation against ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced photo dermatitis in rats, which is an established model to study the aetiopathogenic mechanisms in psoriasis vulgaris, as the former exhibits the same features to those of clinical psoriasis vulgaris in humans. Materials and methods: The animals were segregated into five groups (6/group) and all received their respective formulations dermally prior to chronic UV irradiation for 28 days. The test, placebo, and standard groups; received the test, placebo, and standard formulations respectively; whereas the positive control group received only UV radiation. A normal control group was also maintained. Disease and treatment status were analyzed using various techniques by euthanizing the rats after 28 days. Results: The test formulation was able to ameliorate the UV-induced increase in skin fold, epidermal thickness, and skin edema; inhibit the reduction of hydroxyproline content and incidence of LPO within the skin tissues of exposed animals. The formulation was also able to inhibit the release of proinflammatory cytokines; IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α; and upregulation of NF-κB and COX-2 genes caused by chronic UV exposure. Conclusion: It can be stated that melatonin included in the newly formulated sunscreen was able to inhibit the induction of photodermatitis via immunoregulation of inflammatory cytokines along with NF-κB and COX-2 genes.",

In this study, 7-day exposures were conducted to evaluate the toxicities and bioaccumulation of two organic UV filters, ethylhexylmethoxy-cinnamate (EHMC; octinoxate) and octocrylene (OC) (single- and combined-chemical tests), and diluted sunscreen wash-off water containing both active ingredients to the adult life stage of two hard coral species, Seriatopora caliendrum and Pocillopora damicornis. In the single-chemical tests, death (33.3%) and bleaching (83.3%) were only observed in the 1000 μg/L EHMC treatment of S. caliendrum. In the sunscreen product exposures, 5% sunscreen water (containing 422.34 ± 37.34 μg/L of EHMC and 33.50 ± 7.60 μg/L of OC at Day 0) caused high mortality in S. caliendrum (66.7-83.3%) and P. damicornis (33.3-50%), and tissue concentrations were up to 10 times greater than in the single-chemical exposures; co-exposure to EHMC and OC at similar levels to those in the sunscreen product resulted in bioaccumulation similar to the single-chemical tests. These results confirm the bioaccumulation potential of EHMC and OC and show that other ingredients in sunscreen products may increase the bioavailability of active ingredients to corals and exacerbate the toxicity of sunscreen products. Future studies on the toxicities of PCPs to aquatic organisms should not only focus on the toxicities of active ingredients.",

Actinic keratosis (AK) is a precursor of SCC. STUDY AIM: To evaluate in a prospective cohort study the efficacy of topical piroxicam 0.8% and sunscreen 50+ (ACTX) in the treatment of AK in hypertensive subjects with or without TD treatment. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 119 hypertensive subjects with multiple AK (39 under chronic TD treatment; and 80 treated with other non-TD, non-photosensitizing antihypertensive drugs) were enrolled after their informed consent in a 6-month observational cohort study. All the subjects were treated with ACTX twice daily. The primary endpoint was the evolution of AK lesions at baseline, after 3 and 6 months. The secondary endpoint was the clearance of AK target lesions and field of cancerization by dermoscopic evaluation using a score evaluating erythema, scaling, pigmentation, and follicular plugs (ESPFP score; ranging from 0 to 20). An investigator, unaware of the type of antihypertensive treatments (TD or non-TD), performed all the clinical and dermoscopy evaluations. RESULTS: At baseline, AK mean (SD) lesion number in TD group was 14.1(4) and 14.6(4) in the non-TD group. ESPFP mean (SD) score at baseline was 5.8(1.2) in both groups. A significant reduction of AK lesions in comparison with baseline was observed in both groups. A statistically significant greater reduction was observed in TD in comparison with the non-TD group (-54% vs -32%). ESPFP score was reduced in a higher proportion in the TD group in comparison with the non-TD group (-60% vs -37%, respectively). ACTX treatment was very well tolerated. CONCLUSION: In hypertensive subjects with multiple AK, the topical use of ACTX is associated with a significant reduction of lesions count with an improvement in the field cancerization. The clinical efficacy is more pronounced in subjects under thiazide diuretics treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sun protection factor (SPF) is assessed with sunscreen applied at 2 mg cm-2 . People typically apply around 0·8 mg cm-2 and use sunscreen daily for holidays. Such use results in erythema, which is a risk factor for skin cancer. OBJECTIVES: To determine (i) whether typical sunscreen use resulted in erythema, epidermal DNA damage and photoimmunosuppression during a sunny holiday, (ii) whether optimal sunscreen use inhibited erythema and (iii) whether erythema is a biomarker for photoimmunosuppression in a laboratory study. METHODS: Holidaymakers (n = 22) spent a week in Tenerife (very high ultraviolet index) using their own sunscreens without instruction (typical sunscreen use). Others (n = 40) were given SPF 15 sunscreens with instructions on how to achieve the labelled SPF (sunscreen intervention). Personal ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure was monitored electronically as the standard erythemal dose (SED) and erythema was quantified. Epidermal cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) were determined by immunostaining, and immunosuppression was assessed by contact hypersensitivity (CHS) response. RESULTS: There was no difference between personal UVR exposure in the typical sunscreen use and sunscreen intervention groups (P = 0·08). The former had daily erythema on five UVR-exposed body sites, increased CPDs (P < 0·001) and complete CHS suppression (20 of 22). In comparison, erythema was virtually absent (P < 0·001) when sunscreens were used at ≥ 2 mg cm-2 . A laboratory study showed that 3 SED from three very different spectra suppressed CHS by around ~50%. CONCLUSIONS: Optimal sunscreen use prevents erythema during a sunny holiday. Erythema predicts suppression of CHS (implying a shared action spectrum). Given that erythema and CPDs share action spectra, the data strongly suggest that optimal sunscreen use will also reduce CPD formation and UVR-induced immunosuppression.",

      "abstract": "Exposure to various types of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun has been linked to skin cancer. Use of sunscreen can reduce the damaging and carcinogenic effects of UV radiation. However, multiple chemicals in sunscreen can trigger allergic responses, making people less inclined to use sunscreen. Thus, finding natural, plant-based alternatives to sunscreen with similar efficacy has become an important area of research. Myrrh oil, extracted from the shrub Commiphora myrrha, has been used in the treatment of topical wounds and studies have shown that it may provide protection against solar radiation. This study sought to further investigate if C. myrrha oil can confer protection against UV radiation. A UV-sensitive strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was grown in petri dishes with one half covered by aluminum foil and the other half covered by clear polyethylene food wrap. The polyethylene half was treated with either SPF 15 or SPF 30 sunscreen, C. myrrha oil or a combination of C. myrrha oil and either sunscreen. The plates were exposed to sunlight. Colony death was quantified using visual estimation. While UV blocking by C. myrrha oil alone was not as effective as that by the synthetic sunscreen, the 1:1 combination of C. myrrha oil and SPF 15 sunblock was significantly more effective than SPF 15 sunblock alone to prevent S. cerevisiae death. These data suggest that naturally-based sunscreens supplemented with synthetic UV deterrents may provide a more holistic approach to prevent UV-induced skin damage.

      "abstract": "Skin cancer (melanoma and non-melanoma) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States of America, and non-melanoma skin cancer is the most common cause of Australian hospitalisations with cancer as the principle diagnosis, having a huge cost to the country's health care system. Primary and secondary skin cancer prevention is globally inadequate, with only 3 in 10 American adults using sun protection routinely. Evidence suggests that regular sunscreen use in Australians prevents both melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers, and American research has found that daily sunscreen use reduced the incidence of melanoma - the most skin cancer deaths - by half. Despite this, in many countries and regions around the world, a major ongoing divergence remains on the classification of sunscreen as either a cosmetic product or a form of medical therapy, which in turn affects the consumers' attitudes towards the use of sunscreen. This is also affected by the increasing use of the internet, which has made the purchasing of products internationally convenient and easy for consumers worldwide, including sunscreen products, which are frequently marketed online. There is variation between each country or region and their regulations of sunscreen affect the consequent labelling claims of sunscreen products. This affects the unsuspecting consumer's choices in purchasing sun protection, which may be misinformed. Australia, Canada, and the US are the only countries to classify sunscreen as a form of medical therapy. This paper explores the current classification of sunscreen products in countries and regions around the world and discusses the impact of these discrepancies and similarities on the attitudes of consumers towards sunscreen use. Finally, we make suggestions on changes that can be made to encourage sunscreen use and safe sunscreen purchasing. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(8):899-904.",

      "abstract": "With increasing awareness regarding the risks of sunburn, photoaging, and skin cancer, the use of sunscreens has increased. Organic and inorganic filters are used in sunscreen products worldwide. Concerns have been raised regarding the environmental effects of commonly used organic ultraviolet (UV) filters, including oxybenzone (benzophenone-3), 4-methylbenzylidene camphor, octocrylene, and octinoxate (ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate). Studies have identified UV filters such as oxybenzone, octocrylene, octinoxate, and ethylhexyl salicylate in almost all water sources around the world and have commented that these filters are not easily removed by common wastewater treatment plant techniques. Additionally, in laboratory settings, oxybenzone has been implicated specifically as a possible contributor to coral reef bleaching. Furthermore, UV filters such as 4-methylbenzylidene camphor, oxybenzone, octocrylene, and octinoxate have been identified in various species of fish worldwide, which has possible consequences for the food chain. As dermatologists, it is important for us to continue to emphasize the public health impact of excessive sun exposure and advise our patients about proper photoprotection practice, which consists of seeking shade, wearing photoprotective clothing (including hats and sunglasses), and applying appropriate sunscreens.",

Most of these products do not indicate whether the product includes NPs. In this study, we characterized metal oxide NPs according to size, shape, and composition as well as their aggregation/agglomeration characteristics. In order to comprehend quickly the characterization of metal oxide NPs, we employed single particle inductively coupled plasma (SP-ICPMS) to help quantify the size of metal oxide NPs; then, we use transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to corroborate the results. The crystal size and structure was measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD), there are two crystal phase of TiO2 NPs in sunscreen powder showed in XRD. However, SP-ICPMS proved highly effective in determining the size of NPs, the results of which remarkably good agreement with the TEM measurements. Pre-treatment included a conventional copper grid (requiring sample dilution) to evaluate the size, shape and composition of primary particles or plastic embedding (without the need for sample dilution) to evaluate the aggregate/aggregation of native NOAAs. The proposed method is an effective and fast approach to the characterization of oxide NPs in cosmetic sunscreen powder. These findings outline an alternative approach to the analysis of NPs in powder-form matrix.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Lesion and field-targeted treatments of actinic keratosis (AK) are commonly indicated for grade I and II type lesions. Grade III lesions are in general more difficult to treat. A film-forming medical device containing piroxicam 0.8% and sunscreen (SPF 50+) (PS) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of grade I and II AK lesions. Topical and oral retinoids have been utilized in AK and non-melanoma skin cancers. Topical glycolic acid promotes keratolysis and stimulates collagen synthesis for repair and skin rejuvenation and could be useful in AK treatment strategies. A gel containing retinoid acid (0.02%) and glycolic acid (4%) (RC) is commercially available. The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and local tolerability of a combined treatment approach with PS and RC in subjects with multiple grade II and III AK lesions. METHODS: Twenty-two subjects (16 males and 6 females; mean age 68 years) with more than five AK lesions were enrolled after obtaining their informed consent in a 3-month trial. PS cream was applied twice daily every day and RC gel was applied twice daily for 2 consecutive days every week. The primary endpoint was the evolution of the AK mean number from baseline to the end of the trial. Secondary endpoints were the thickness of the target lesion (expressed in mm3) and the erythema score (hemoglobin content), evaluated using a standardized computer-based image acquisition analysis system (Anthera 3D). RESULTS: At baseline, the mean (SD) lesion number was 7.7 (3) for grade II and 1.4 (1) for grade III AK. At the end of the study, a significant (P = 0.001) reduction was observed for both grade II (- 81%; from 7.7 to 1.5) and grade III (- 22%) lesions. Six grade III lesions out of 31 (20%), presented at baseline, completely disappeared at month 3. For grade III lesions, a significant mean thickness reduction of 51% was observed at month 3. The erythema score (all lesions) was reduced by 70%. Four patients out of 22 (18%) were completely free of AK lesions at month 3. No severe side effects were reported. CONCLUSION: In this exploratory trial, a combined treatment with a cream containing piroxicam and sunscreen and a retinoic/glycolic gel was associated with a substantial reduction of both grade II and III AK lesions with good local tolerability.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Skin cancer rates are increasing. Interventions to increase adolescent sunscreen use and skin self-examination (SSE) are required. METHODS: Quasi-experimental design; 1 control and 4 intervention group schools in Scotland, UK. Participants were 15-16 year old students on the school register. The intervention was a theoretically-informed (Common-Sense Model and Health Action Process Approach) 50-min presentation, delivered by a skin cancer specialist nurse and young adult skin cancer survivor, to students in a classroom, supplemented by a home-based assignment. Outcome variables were sunscreen use intention, SSE intention/behaviour, planning, illness perceptions and skin cancer communication behaviour, measured 2 weeks pre- and 4 weeks post- intervention using self-completed pen and paper survey. School attendance records were used to record intervention up-take; students self-reported completion of the home-based assignment. Pearson's chi-square test, analysis of variance, and non-parametric Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test were used to measure outcomes and associations between variables. Focus groups elicited students' (n = 29) views on the intervention. Qualitative data were analysed thematically. RESULTS: Five of 37 invited schools participated. 639 (81%) students in intervention schools received the intervention; 33.8% completed the home-based assignment. 627 (69.6%) of students on the school register in intervention and control schools completed a questionnaire at baseline; data for 455 (72.6%) students were available at baseline and follow-up. Focus groups identified four themes - personal experiences of skin cancer, distaste for sunscreen, relevance of SSE in adolescence, and skin cancer conversations. Statistically significant (p < 0.05) changes were observed for sunscreen use, SSE, planning, and talk about skin cancer in intervention schools but not the control. Significant associations were found between sunscreen use, planning and 2 illness perceptions (identity and consequence) and between SSE, planning and 3 illness perceptions (timeline, causes, control). CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to promote sunscreen use and SSE in the context of an adolescent school-based psychoeducation intention. Further research is required to improve study uptake, intervention adherence and effectiveness. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN11141528.",

RESULTS: More SSc(-) MN displayed dermoscopic changes at end of NBUVB therapy compared to the start of therapy (p=0.035). The number of the MN that decreased in size and showed loss of structure was significantly higher in SSc(-) MN (p=0.04 and p=0.026, respectively).

OBJECTIVE: To compare the sunburn protection provided by SPF 100+ and SPF 50+ sunscreen in conditions of actual use. METHODS: A total of 199 healthy men and women (≥18 years) participated in a natural sunlight, single-exposure, split-face, randomized, double-blind study in Vail, Colorado. Each participant wore both sunscreens simultaneously during activities, with no use restrictions other than designation of the treatment area. Erythema was clinically assessed on the day following exposure. Comparative efficacy was evaluated through bilateral comparison of sunburn between treatment areas and erythema score, as evaluated separately for each treatment area. RESULTS: Following an average 6.1 ± 1.3 hours of sun exposure, investigator-blinded evaluation identified 55.3% of the participants (110 of 199) as more sunburned on the SPF 50+ protected side and 5% (10 of 199) on the SPF 100+ protected side. After exposure, 40.7% of the participants (81 of 199) exhibited increased erythema scores (by ≥1) on the SPF 50+ protected side as compared with 13.6% (27 of 199) on the SPF 100+ protected side. LIMITATIONS: Single-day exposure may not extrapolate to benefits of longer-term protection. CONCLUSION: SPF 100+ sunscreen was significantly more effective in protecting against sunburn than SPF 50+ sunscreen in actual use conditions.",

Actinic keratosis (AK) is considered the precursor of these non-melanoma skin cancers. Sun protection is mandatory in subjects with AK and this preventive strategy is very important in OTR. Treatment of the field of cancerization is also crucial to reduce the risk of recurrence of skin lesions in AK and non-melanoma skin cancer patients. Activation of cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 enzymes plays an important role in the pathogenesis of skin cancers. Topical application of cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as diclofenac and, more recently, piroxicam has shown to reduce AK lesions in immunocompetent subjects. A medical device containing piroxicam and SPF 50+ sunscreen filters (P+SS) has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing AK lesions and improving the field of cancerization. We report the effect of P+SS, applied for 16 weeks, in a case series of 10 OTR subjects with multiple AK lesions. P+SS treatment was associated with a relevant AK lesion reduction (>75%) in 7 patients (with a complete clearance in 3 subjects) with an improvement in the field of cancerization. This medical device could be considered a promising long-term curative and preventive treatment in OTR patients at high risk of non-melanoma skin cancers."

High-quality epidemiological studies suggest regular sunscreen use prevents melanoma. OBJECTIVES: To calculate the potential impact fraction (PIF) for melanoma in the U.S.A. and Australia assuming a range of different intervention scenarios intended to increase sunscreen use. METHODS: We calculated the PIF, the proportional difference between the observed number of melanomas arising under prevailing levels of sunscreen use compared with the number expected under counterfactual scenarios. We used published melanoma incidence projections for Australia and the white population in the U.S.A. from 2012 through to 2031 as the baseline condition, with estimates for protective effects of 'regular sunscreen use' from the literature. Sunscreen prevalence was sourced from national or state surveys. RESULTS: Under a plausible public health intervention scenario comprising incremental increases in sunscreen prevalence over a 10-year implementation programme, we estimated that cumulatively to 2031, 231 053 fewer melanomas would arise in the U.S. white population (PIF 11%) and 28 071 fewer melanomas would arise in Australia (PIF 10%). Under the theoretical maximum model of sunscreen use, almost 797 000 (PIF 38%) and approximately 96 000 (PIF 34%) melanomas would be prevented in the U.S.A. and Australia, respectively between 2012 and 2031. A sensitivity analysis using weaker effect estimates resulted in more conservative PIF estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, interventions to increase use of sunscreen would result in moderate reductions in melanoma incidence, assuming no compensatory overexposure to the sun. Countries with a high incidence of melanoma should monitor levels of sunscreen use in the community.",

The components of these creams can end up in the waters affecting coastal species. Mediterranean mussels (Mytillus galloprovincialis) were subjected to an acute exposure of a sunscreen with TiO2 in their composition during 24h. The low and medium concentrations used in the assays contained a concentration of TiO2 in the range of values found in coastal waters of the Balearic Islands. Titanium and metallothionein concentrations were progressively increasing in gills with the sunscreen concentration in a dose-dependent manner. The activities of the antioxidant enzymes and the detoxification glutathione s-transferase evidenced a hormetic shape response with increased activities at lower sunscreen concentrations, a response that was abolished at the highest concentration. In accordance with these enzyme activities, the levels of malondialdehyde, as a marker of lipid peroxidation, were significantly elevated by the higher sunscreen concentrations. Acetylcholinesterase activity maintained control activities except for the highest sunscreen concentration, where a significant decrease was evidenced. In conclusion, the treatment of mussels with a sunscreen containing TiO2 in the range of Balearic coastal waters induces an adaptive response that is overcome by the highest concentration. Follow-up biomonitoring studies are necessary to control the concentration of sunscreen compound in coastal waters such as titanium since they can induce oxidative stress to affected organisms.",

The Center for Disease Control fourth national report on human exposure to environmental chemicals demonstrated that approximately 97% of the people tested have oxybenzone present in their urine, and independent scientists have reported various concentrations in waterways and fish worldwide. Oxybenzone can also react with chlorine, producing hazardous by-products that can concentrate in swimming pools and wastewater treatment plants. Moreover, adverse reactions could very well be increased by the closed loop of ingesting fish contaminated with oxybenzone and/or washing the ingredient off our bodies and having it return in drinking water as treatment plants do not effectively remove the chemical as part of their processing protocols. In humans, oxybenzone has been reported to produce contact and photocontact allergy reactions, implemented as a possible endocrine disruptor and has been linked to Hirschsprung's disease. Environmentally, oxybenzone has been shown to produce a variety of toxic reactions in coral and fish ranging from reef bleaching to mortality. Lastly, with the rise in skin cancer rates and the availability of more effective sunscreen actives such as micronized zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, serious doubts about the relative prevention benefit of personal care products containing oxybenzone must be raised and compared with the potential negative health and environmental effects caused by the accumulation of this and other chemicals in the ecosystem.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Student-athletes (SAs) have an increased skin cancer risk on account of significant ultraviolet exposure; however, their sun-protective practices are suboptimal. A novel program, Stanford University Network for Sun Protection, Outreach, Research, and Teamwork (SUNSPORT), was designed to target SAs, coaches, and athletic trainers (ATs). OBJECTIVE: To measure the impact of educational intervention on sun protection beliefs and practices of SAs. METHODS: A survey of sun protection beliefs and practices was administered to National Collegiate Athletic Association athletes before and after intervention. SUNSPORT dermatologists educated SAs, coaches, and ATs regarding skin cancer risk and prevention methods. The main outcome was frequency of sunscreen use by SAs before versus after intervention. RESULTS: A total of 846 National Collegiate Athletic Association athletes were surveyed between September 23, 2012, and September 20, 2015. After intervention, significant increases were observed in sunscreen use 4 or more days per week by SAs (from 26% to 39% [P = .02]), SAs spoken to by their coach about sun safety (from 26% to 57% [P = .0001]), and SA recognition of higher skin cancer risk (from 54% to 67% [P = .04]). LIMITATIONS: Intervention in only 1 West Coast university and no paired data. CONCLUSIONS: Following the SUNSPORT intervention, SAs were significantly more likely to use sunscreen, especially if encouraged by their coach. This study emphasizes that education directed to SAs, ATs, and coaches can improve sun-protective practices in SAs.",

However, protection can only be achieved through effective application, and areas that are routinely missed are likely at increased risk of UV damage. Here we sought to determine if specific areas of the face are missed during routine sunscreen application, and whether provision of public health information is sufficient to improve coverage. To investigate this, 57 participants were imaged with a UV sensitive camera before and after sunscreen application: first visit; minimal pre-instruction, second visit; provided with a public health information statement. Images were scored using a custom automated image analysis process designed to identify areas of high UV reflectance, i.e. missed during sunscreen application, and analysed for 5% significance. Analyses revealed eyelid and periorbital regions to be disproportionately missed during routine sunscreen application (median 14% missed in eyelid region vs 7% in rest of face, p<0.01). Provision of health information caused a significant improvement in coverage to eyelid areas in general however, the medial canthal area was still frequently missed. These data reveal that a public health announcement-type intervention could be effective at improving coverage of high risk areas of the face, however high risk areas are likely to remain unprotected therefore other mechanisms of sun protection should be widely promoted such as UV blocking sunglasses.",

      "abstract": "Oxybenzone (OBZ), a common ingredient in sunscreens and personal care products, has been frequently detected in effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants and also in surface waters. OBZ is an emerging contaminant due to its adverse impacts on marine/aquatic ecosystems. To investigate the removal and degradation capacity of phytotreatment for OBZ, the common wetland plant species Cyperus alternifolius L. was exposed to this compound at 5, 25 and 50 μM for 120 h, respectively. Continuous uptake by roots and accumulation in plant tissues was observed over the exposure time, and depletion of spiked OBZ from the aqueous medium exceeded 73.9 ± 9.1% after 120 h. Similar to its fate in mammalian cells, OBZ is activated in a phase I reaction resulting in the hydroxylated metabolite 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone (DHB). Independently, two phase II metabolites were identified as oxybenzone-glucoside (OBZ-Glu) and oxybenzone-(6-O-malonyl)-glucoside (OBZ-Mal-Glu) by LC-MS/MS. Formation of these metabolites increased over the experimental period. To our knowledge this is the first time that DHB, OBZ-Glu and OBZ-Mal-Glu are shown to be formed in higher plant tissues. Furthermore, plant defense systems-antioxidative enzymes (SOD, CAT, APOX and POX) were found to be elevated to counteract stress caused by exposure to OBZ. This study presents the huge potential of aquatic plants to cope with benzophenone type UV filters in contaminated water bodies.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Sunscreen protection in subjects with actinic keratosis (AK) is highly recommended to prevent clinical evolution of this in situ skin cancer condition. Use of topical anti-cyclooxygenase drugs such as diclofenac and piroxicam reduces the number of lesions and improves the cancerization field. A film-forming medical device in a cream formulation containing organic and inorganic sun-filters (50+ SPF) and piroxicam 0.8% (ACTX) has shown in a pilot, single-center, open trial to reduce AK lesions improving the cancerization field. AIM: We evaluated in a multicenter, assessor-blinded, 3 month trial the efficacy of ACTX in AK. METHODS: A total of 70 subjects with at least three AK lesions on the scalp or face were enrolled after written informed consent. Primary outcomes of the study were the clinical evolution of number of AK lesions on a target zone area and the evolution of dermoscopy features of the target lesion, assessing erythema, scaling, pigmentation, and follicular plug, using a 5 point score (from 0 to 4; maximum score: 16). Lesion count and dermoscopy score were evaluated in a blind fashion assessing digital color high definition coded images. A secondary outcome was the Investigator Global Score (IGS) of clinical evolution of the target area using a 7 point scale from -2 (significantly worse) to +4 (completely cured). IGS was evaluated in an open fashion. Subjects were instructed to apply the cream twice daily on the target area, using one finger-tip unit for the treatment of a 35 cm2 area. RESULTS: All but one subject (40 men and 30 women, mean age 73 years) concluded the study period. At baseline the mean (±SD) number of AK lesions in the target area were 7.0 (5.9) with a median value of 5 and the dermoscopy score of the target lesion was 7.0 (2.3) with a median value of 7.0. ACTX treatment reduced AK lesions to 3.2 (2.9), (p = .0001; Wilcoxon Test), representing a 55% relative reduction. Dermoscopy score was reduced to 3.3 (2.6) (p = .0001) (a reduction of 53%). The IGS after ACTX treatment was +1.9 (1.1), with a median of 2.0. A total of 86% of subjects showed a clinical improvement of IGS (≥1) with a very significant/complete clearance (score +3 or +4) in 42% subjects. No change or a worsening of AK lesions was observed in 14% of the subjects. The product was well tolerated. No serious adverse events were reported during the duration of the trial. CONCLUSION: In this multicenter, assessor-blinded trial, the use of a film-forming medical device with sun protection and anti-inflammatory actions was effective in reducing AK lesions and improving the dermoscopy aspect of the target lesion in 86% of treated subjects. A head-to-head trial evaluating the efficacy of this medical device in comparison with diclofenac is warranted to establish whether this therapeutic approach could offer additional advantages in term of AK lesion reduction compared to an established topical treatment.

      "abstract": "The literature claims that incorporation of antioxidants into sunscreens provides additional skin photoprotection by scavenging free radicals formed due to sun radiation, but there are limited in vivo studies that support this hypothesis. This study aims to examine whether addition of antioxidants to a broad-spectrum sunscreen increases its photoprotective effect in real-use conditions. Sunscreen formulations composed of stable UV filters (Tinosorb® S, Tinosorb® M, Uvinul® APlus, and Uvinul® T150) alone or in combination with antioxidants (Spirulina and dimethylmethoxy chromanol-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles) were developed and their appearance, odor, rheological behavior, Sun Protection Factor (SPF), and UVA protection were analyzed. Next, it was conducted a 3-month, single-blind clinical study with 44 healthy subjects (30-50years). Before and 28, 54, and 84days after twice-daily self application of the sunscreens on the face, the stratum corneum water content, transepidermal water loss, dermis echogenicity, and skin elasticity and pigmentation were measured. At the end of the study period, the volunteers answered a questionnaire containing terms related to sensory characteristics of the formulations. All formulations were stable and exhibited non-Newtonian and pseudoplastic behavior, in vivo SPF 30, and good UVA protection. Antioxidant supplementation to the sunscreen formulation significantly improved the skin pigmentation, the collagen degradation on the dermis and thereby the skin net elasticity after 84days of treatment compared to the sunscreen alone. Concerning safety, all formulations were considered non-irritant according to the sensorial analyses, whose results agreed with the clinical study findings.",

The cream was applied topically twicedaily on CFC/AK areas and patients were followedup for three months, with no other treatments. Theprimary outcome was the overall response rate (ORR),categorized as complete response (CR, completeresolution of AKs), partial response (PR, reduction inthe number of AKs), and no-response (NR, similar/increase in number of AKs). A 100% PR was observed.All subjects displayed at minimum, a 50% reductionin their lesion number and most patients experiencedalmost CR. Evaluation of AK numbers revealed anabsolute count reduction of 76.6% in the number oflesions, with the mean number of lesions reducedfrom 13.4 to 3.1 (p &lt; 0.0001). No adverse events werereported.

      "abstract": "The development of innovative, safe and non-photocatalytic sunscreens is urgently needed, as it is essential to have sunscreen filters offering appropriate UV protection without damaging the environment and/or generating free radicals when in contact with the skin. Hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, HAp) when substituted with iron has UV protection properties and is not photocatalytic; HAp was used to make a sunscreen filter by treating cod fish bones in an iron-containing solution, and then calcining them at 700°C. Here we present a systematic and advanced study on this material, to obtain a sunscreen with improved UV absorbing properties. Bones were treated with three different iron salts - Fe(II) chloride, Fe(II) lactate and Fe(III) nitrate - under various pH conditions. Results showed that Fe(II) chloride in basic pH led to the most effective iron inclusion. High energy ball milling or ultrasound were investigated to increase surface area and corresponding UV absorption; high energy ball milling treatment led to the best optical properties. The optimum powders were used to formulate UV protection creams, which showed Sun Protection Factor (SPF) values significantly superior to the control cream (up to 4.1). Moreover the critical wavelength (λcrit) was >370nm (388-389nm) and UVA/UVB ratios were very close to 1. With these properties these sunscreens can be classified as broad UV protectors. Results also showed that combining these powders with other sunscreens (i.e. titanium dioxide), a synergic effect between the different components was also observed. This investigation showed that HAp-based sunscreens of marine origin are a valid alternative to commercial products, safe for the health of the customers and, being non-photocatalytic, do not pose a threat to the environment.",

OBJECTIVE: To measure the effect of 2 water-resistant sunscreens on local sweat production in men and women exercising in the heat and to compare those effects with the expected inhibition resulting from the use of an antiperspirant. DESIGN: Randomized crossover study. SETTING: Exercise in the heat (ambient temperature = 30.2°C ± 0.4°C dry bulb and 58% ± 4.3% relative humidity) in a controlled-environment laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Twenty physically active, apparently healthy college students, 10 men (age = 22.5 ± 2.8 years, height = 1.771 ± 0.069 m, mass = 70.2 ± 11.0 kg) and 10 women (age = 22.2 ± 3.2 years, height = 1.625 ± 0.075 m, mass = 57.7 ± 7.9 kg). INTERVENTION(S): With sweat-collection patches applied to their right and left scapular regions, the participants performed 2 exercise sessions on consecutive days. We assigned skin treatments (antiperspirant; organic chemical sun filter, sunscreen A; inorganic physical sun block, sunscreen B; no lotion) randomly to side and session. Participants pedaled at 79% ± 1% of maximum heart rate for 20 minutes in the heat. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Scapular localized sweat rate. RESULTS: No baseline, environmental, or exercise condition was different among skin treatments. Scapular localized sweat rate was lower for the antiperspirant treatment (88.3 μL/min·dm 2 ; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 82.0, 94.7 μL/min·dm2) and the inorganic physical sun block (sunscreen B) treatment (99.3 μL/min·dm 2 ; 95% CI = 93.1, 105.5 μL/min·dm2) than for the organic chemical sun filter (sunscreen A) treatment (114.8 μL/min·dm 2 ; 95% CI = 108.8, 120.6 μL/min·dm2) or the no-lotion treatment (122.6 μL/min·dm 2 ; 95% CI = 116.2, 129.0 μL/min·dm2; P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: The inorganic physical sun block, sunscreen B, hindered effective sweating to the same extent as the antiperspirant, whereas the treatment with the organic chemical sun filter, sunscreen A, was not different from the control treatment. At this stage, it is not possible to identify the specific ingredient responsible for the effect.",

PATIENTS: Enrolled subjects applied a galenic formulation of piroxicam 0.8%, vehiculated in a topical product containing sun filters with high (50+) and broad spectrum (UVA) actions, twice a day for 6 months. Subjects were then followed up for additional 12 months. Thirty-eight subjects with a total of 69 A.K. lesions participated in the trial. The primary outcome was the evolution of the Actinic Keratosis Erythema Scale Atrophy (A.K.E.S.A) score assessing erythema, scale, and atrophy of a target A.K. lesion. Secondary outcomes were the percentage of treated lesions with complete (100%) or partial (≥75%) clearance and the evaluation skin tolerability. RESULTS: A.K.E.S.A. mean (S.D.) score at baseline was 7.5 (1.2). After 6 months of treatment, A.K.E.S.A. score decreased to 0.9 (1.1), a -88% reduction versus baseline. At the end of follow-up, A.K.E.S.A. score was 0.8 (1.2). A complete response was achieved in 38 of the 69 lesions (55%, 95% C.I.: 43% to 66%) and clearance was maintained 1 year post-treatment. A partial clearance was observed in 57 of 69 treated lesions (83%, 95% C.I.: 73% to 91%). Adverse events were limited to mild local irritation. CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that 6 month topical piroxicam 0.8% is efficacious and well tolerated in A.K. Clinical efficacy is maintained 1 year post-treatment. The main limitation of our study is that it was an open label non-controlled trial. Future controlled trials are warranted in order to compare the efficacy and tolerability of this topical piroxicam preparation with standard treatments in the management of A.K.",

Diacetyl boldine (DAB) stabilizes tyrosinase in its inactive form while TGF-β1 biomimetic oligopeptide-68 inhibits tyrosinase activity. AIMS: (1) to study the efficacy and safety of the combination use of two formulae containing two principal ingredients: DAB and TGF-β1 biomimetic oligopeptide-68 on facial melasma, and (2) to compare their efficacy with 2% and 4% hydroquinone cream (HQ) on sun-protected normal skin. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, 12-week comparative study of pre-/post-treatment was conducted in 40 females. Melasma was evaluated by manual MASI score and MASI score with instrumentally graded darkness at baseline, 6th week, and 12th week. The author also compared their effect with HQ on the arms, assessed their safety profile throughout the study. RESULTS: Thirty-eight subjects have completed the study. Their melasma showed improvement at the 6th week and 12th week as compared with baseline (P < 0.05). None developed severe reaction. Most subjects had temporary, mild skin reaction. About 2.6% of subjects graded themselves markedly improved, 76.3% moderately improved, and 21.1% slightly improved. Each formula showed either more efficacy or exerted faster action on pigment reduction than HQ. CONCLUSION: Combination of DAB serum at night and DAB/TGF-β1 biomimetic oligopeptide-68/sunscreen cream in the morning and at noon was effective and safe for facial melasma. They were superior to HQ in pigment reduction.",

      "abstract": "Oxybenzone (OBZ), known as Benzophenone-3, is a commonly used UV filter in sun tans and skin protectants, entering aquatic systems either directly during recreational activities or indirectly through wastewater treatment plants discharge. To study the potential degradation capacity of plants for OBZ in phytotreatment, a well-established hairy root culture (Armoracia rusticana) was treated with OBZ. More than 20% of spiked OBZ (100μM) was eliminated from the medium by hairy roots after 3h of exposure. Two metabolites were identified as oxybenzone-glucoside (OBZ-Glu) and oxybenzone-(6-O-malonyl)-glucoside (OBZ-Mal-Glu) by LC-MS/MS and TOF-MS. Formation of these metabolites was confirmed by enzymatic synthesis, as well as enzymatic and alkaline hydrolysis. Incubation with O-glucosyltransferase (O-GT) extracted from roots formed OBZ-Glu; whereas β-d-Glucosidase hydrolyzed OBZ-Glu. However, alkaline hydrolysis led to cleavage of OBZ-Mal-Glu and yielded OBZ-Glu. In the hairy root culture, an excretion of OBZ-Glu into the growth medium was observed while the corresponding OBZ-Mal-Glu remained stored in root cells over the incubation time. We propose that metabolism of oxybenzone in plants involves initial conjugation with glucose to form OBZ-Glu followed by malonylation to yield OBZ-Mal-Glu. To our best knowledge this first finding presenting the potential of plants to degrade benzophenone type UV filters by phytoremediation.",

The present study aimed to determine the degradation efficiency and mechanism of the sunscreen agent p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) using the UV/Fe(2+)/persulphate (PS) method. A series of irradiation experiments were conducted to optimise the system conditions and to study the impacts of the natural anion. Free radicals and degradation products were identified in order to clarify the degradation mechanism. Initial PS and Fe(2+) concentrations showed significant impacts on PABA degradation. Natural anions, such as Cl(-), NO3 (-), H2PO4 (-) and HCO3 (-), impeded PABA degradation because of ion (Fe(2+)) capture, radical scavenging or pH effects. Hydroxyl (HO·) and sulphate (SO4 (·-)) radicals were two main radicals observed in the UV/Fe(2+)/PS system; of these, SO4 (·-) showed greater effects on PABA degradation. Over 99 % of the available PABA was completely degraded into carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) by the UV/Fe(2+)/PS system, and the remaining PABA participated in complex radical reactions. By-products were identified by total ion chromatography and mass spectrometry. Our research provides a treatment process for PABA with high degradation efficiency and environmental safety and introduces a new strategy for sunscreen degradation.",

This study examined predictors of occupational sunscreen use in a group of US Hispanic adults who work outdoors. RESULTS: A population-based sample of outdoor workers (n = 149, 85 % male) completed survey measures regarding their demographics, melanoma risk, perceived skin cancer risk, skin cancer knowledge, and their occupational sunscreen use. Sixty-nine percent of the sample reported never or rarely wearing sunscreen while working outdoors. Being female (p = .02), having a higher level of education (p = .03), and residing at a higher latitude (p = .04) were associated with more frequent sunscreen use.

The reaction products were detected using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Since HOCl treatment leads to more polar products than EHMC, application of polar extracting agents, dichloromethane and ethyl acetate/n-hexane mixture, gave better results in terms of chlorinated breakdown products identification than n-hexane. Reaction of EHMC with HOCl lead to the formation of C=C bridge cleavage products such as 2-ethylhexyl chloroacetate, 1-chloro-4-methoxybenzene, 1,3-dichloro-2-methoxybenzene, and 3-chloro-4-methoxybenzaldehyde. High reactivity of C=C bond attached to benzene ring is also characteristic for MCA, since it can be converted in the presence of HOCl to 2,4-dichlorophenole, 2,6-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone, 1,3-dichloro-2-methoxybenzene, 1,2,4-trichloro-3-methoxybenzene, 2,4,6-trichlorophenole, and 3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxyacetophenone. Surprisingly, in case of EHMC/HOCl/UV, much less breakdown products were formed compared to non-UV radiation treatment. In order to describe the nature of EHMC and MCA degradation, local reactivity analysis based on the density functional theory (DFT) was performed. Fukui function values showed that electrophilic attack of HOCl to the C=C bridge in EHMC and MCA is highly favorable (even more preferable than phenyl ring chlorination). This suggests that HOCl electrophilic addition is probably the initial step of EHMC degradation.",

People often wear water-resistant sunscreen formulations during extended period of water activities in the summer to protect skin from harmful UV rays. We wanted to evaluate whether sunscreen formulations can also serve as additional water barriers to help mitigate the disruption in stratum corneum caused by constant exposure to water. METHODS: We conducted trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) measurement in a controlled water patch (including salt and chlorine water) model and then applied this relevant model to study the effects of pre-treatments of sunscreen sprays and stick. We also conducted water sorption-desorption test in vivo with and without sunscreens. Finally, we studied the effect of constant water exposure combined with a known irritant, sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), in a randomized clinical trial. RESULTS: We found that application of sunscreen formulations help mitigate water-induced barrier disruption by repelling water at skin surface. Pre-treatment of sunscreen also statistically decreased the irritation in an acute patch test model. CONCLUSIONS: Hydrophobic sunscreen formulations can help protect skin from extended water exposure by serving as additional water barriers.",

An effect was said to be mediated if the standardised path between processes of change, decisional balance and sun protection outcomes was significant. DESIGN: Longitudinal models of sun protection using data from individuals in the precontemplation (N = 964) and preparation (N = 463) stages who participated of an expert system intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Nine processes of change for sun protection, decisional balance constructs of sun protection (pros and cons), sun avoidance behaviour and sunscreen use. RESULTS: With the exception of two processes in the preparation stage, processes of change predicted the pros (r = .126-.614), and the pros predicted the outcomes (r = .181-.272). Three models with the cons as mediator in the preparation stage, and none in the precontemplation stage, showed a mediated relationship between processes and outcomes. CONCLUSION: In general, mediation analyses found both the process of change-to-pros and pros-to-behaviour paths significant for both precontemplation and preparation stages, and for both sun avoidance and sunscreen use outcomes. Findings provide support for the importance of assessing the role of underlying risk cognitions in improving sun protection adherence.",

METHODS: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) coupled with a window-type microchip K-kit/copper grid and X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to characterize the oxide NPs. RESULTS: TME pre-treatment was performed using two approaches: using a conventional copper grid (requiring dilution) and using a K-kit (not requiring dilution). The use of K-kit in conjunction with XRD makes it possible to obtain direct measurements from samples that have not undergone pre-treatment, which could otherwise alter the nature of the samples, such as the degree of agglomeration. XRD was used to obtain information related to particle size and crystal structure. A strong correlation was observed between XRD and TEM measurements. CONCLUSION: The proposed measurement methods were shown to be highly effective in the characterization of oxide NPs in sunscreen sprays, providing consistent information related to NPs and their interactions in the formulations.",

METHOD: College students (N = 253) were randomly assigned to two groups: a self-regulatory and a standard-care condition. Sunscreen use, intention to use sunscreen, and planning were assessed at two points in time, 1 month apart. RESULTS: The self-regulatory intervention improved planning to use sunscreen but not the behavior directly. Planning emerged as the mediator between conditions and later sunscreen use, controlling for baseline behavior. Moreover, participants who were less motivated benefited more from the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Although it is generally assumed that planning interventions are best designed for already motivated persons, the present findings suggest that less prepared individuals might have more to gain from a brief self-regulatory intervention.",

      "abstract": "Benzophenone-3 (BP-3) has been widely used in sunscreens and many other consumer products, including cosmetics. The widespread use of BP-3 has resulted in its release into the water environment, and hence its potential impact on aquatic ecosystem is of concern. To better understand the risk associated with BP-3 in aquatic ecosystems, we conducted a thorough review of available articles regarding the physicochemical properties, toxicokinetics, environmental occurrence, and toxic effects of BP-3 and its suspected metabolites. BP-3 is lipophilic, photostable, and bioaccumulative, and can be rapidly absorbed via oral and dermal routes. BP-3 is reported to be transformed into three major metabolites in vivo, i.e., benzophenone-1 (BP-1), benzophenone-8 (BP-8), and 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzophenone (THB). BP-1 has a longer biological half-life than its parent compound and exhibits greater estrogenic potency in vitro. BP-3 has been detected in water, soil, sediments, sludge, and biota. The maximum detected level in ambient freshwater and seawater is 125ng/L and 577.5ng/L, respectively, and in wastewater influent is 10,400ng/L. The major sources of BP-3 are reported to be human recreational activities and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. BP-3 and its derivatives have been also detected in fish lipid. In humans, BP-3 has been detected in urine, serum, and breast milk samples worldwide. BP-1 has also been detected in placental tissues of delivering women. While sunscreens and cosmetics are known to be major sources of exposure, the fact that BP-3 has been detected frequently among young children and men suggests other sources. An increasing number of in vitro studies have indicated the endocrine disrupting capacity of BP-3. Based on a receptor binding assay, BP-3 has shown strong anti-androgenic and weak estrogenic activities but at the same time BP-3 displays anti-estrogenic activity as well. Predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) for BP-3 was derived at 1.32μg/L. The levels observed in ambient water are generally an order of magnitude lower than the PNEC, but in wastewater influents, hazard quotients (HQs) greater than 1 were noted. Considering limited ecotoxicological information and significant seasonal and spatial variations of BP-3 in water, further studies on environmental monitoring and potential consequences of long-term exposure in aquatic ecosystem are warranted.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The most common side-effect of ablative fractional skin resurfacing in Asians is post inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). Various attempts have been made to reduce the occurrence of PIH after laser treatment including sun avoidance, the use of preoperative and postoperative treatment regimens, and treatment using conservative energy settings and epidermal protection. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the use of broad-spectrum sunscreen with anti-inflammatory agents starting on the first day after fractional CO2 laser skin resurfacing reduces the incidence of post laser PIH. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients were treated with ablative fractional CO2 resurfacing on both sides of their faces at 10 mJ and 10% density. Each subject was randomly treated on one side of the face with petrolatum ointment four times a day for the first week after laser treatment and on the other side of the face with petrolatum ointment four times a day plus broad-spectrum sunscreen with anti-inflammatory agents in the morning starting on the first day after laser treatment. Transepidermal water loss was recorded at baseline and every day for 1 week. Melanin and erythema indexes were measured at baseline, 1-, 2-week, 1-, 2- and at 3-month post treatment. RESULTS: Of the 30 patients involved in the study, 26 received the treatment and attended 1-, 2-week, 1-, 2- and 3-month post-treatment visits. Four patients were withdrawn from the study because they could not attend every follow-up visit. There was no statistically significant difference in transepidermal water loss at baseline, immediately after laser treatment, or at the D1 to D7 follow-up visits. Erythema index had no significantly statistical difference at baseline, 1-, 2- and at 3-month after laser treatment. Furthermore, there was a statistically significant difference in melanin index at 1-week post laser treatment between both sides (P = 0.001). Melanin index at the 1-week follow-up visit on the side treated with broad-spectrum sunscreen with anti-inflammatory agents starting on the first day after laser treatment was significantly less than the control side. CONCLUSION: The use of broad-spectrum sunscreen with anti-inflammatory agents starting on the first day after ablative fractional skin resurfacing can decrease the incidence of PIH after laser treatment at 1-week postoperatively.",

      "abstract": "Members of the green algal genus Klebsormidium (Klebsormidiales, Streptophyta) are typical components of biological soil crust communities worldwide, which exert important ecological functions. Klebsormidium fluitans (F. Gay) Lokhorst was isolated from an aeroterrestrial biofilm as well as from four different biological soil crusts along an elevational gradient between 600 and 2350 m in the Tyrolean and South Tyrolean Alps (Austria, Italy), which are characterised by seasonally high solar radiation. Since the UVtolerance of Klebsormidium has not been studied in detail, an ecophysiological and biochemical study was applied. The effects of controlled artificial ultraviolet radiation (UVR; <9 W m(-2) UV-A, <0.5 W m(-2) UV-B) on growth, photosynthetic performance and the capability to synthesise mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) as potential sunscreen compounds were comparatively investigated to evaluate physiological plasticity and possible ecotypic differentiation within this Klebsormidium species. Already under control conditions, the isolates showed significantly different growth rates ranging from 0.42 to 0.74 μm day(-1). The UVR effects on growth were isolate specific, with only two strains affected by the UV treatments. Although all photosynthetic and respiratory data indicated strain-specific differences under control conditions, UV-A and UV-B treatment led only to rather minor effects. All physiological results clearly point to a high UV tolerance in the K. fluitans strains studied, which can be explained by their biochemical capability to synthesize and accumulate a putative MAA after exposure to UV-A and UV-B. Using HPLC, a UV-absorbing compound with an absorption maximum at 324 nm could be identified in all strains. The steady-state concentrations of this Klebsormidium MAA under control conditions ranged from 0.09 to 0.93 mg g(-1) dry weight (DW). While UV-A led to a slight stimulation of MAA accumulation, exposure to UV-B was accompanied by a strong but strain-specific increase of this compound (5.34-12.02 mg(-1) DW), thus supporting its function as UV sunscreen. Although ecotypic differences in the UVR response patterns of the five K. fluitans strains occurred, this did not correlate with the altitude of the respective sampling location. All data indicate a generally high UV tolerance which surely contributes to the aeroterrestrial lifestyle of K. fluitans in soil crusts of the alpine regions of the European Alps.",

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether regular use of sunscreen compared with discretionary use or β-carotene supplements compared with placebo retard skin aging, measured by degree of photoaging. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled, community-based intervention. (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12610000086066). SETTING: Nambour, Australia (latitude 26° S). PATIENTS: 903 adults younger than 55 years out of 1621 adults randomly selected from a community register. INTERVENTION: Random assignment into 4 groups: daily use of broad-spectrum sunscreen and 30 mg of β-carotene, daily use of sunscreen and placebo, discretionary use of sunscreen and 30 mg of β-carotene, and discretionary use of sunscreen and placebo. MEASUREMENTS: Change in microtopography between 1992 and 1996 in the sunscreen and β-carotene groups compared with controls, graded by assessors blinded to treatment allocation. RESULTS: The daily sunscreen group showed no detectable increase in skin aging after 4.5 years. Skin aging from baseline to the end of the trial was 24% less in the daily sunscreen group than in the discretionary sunscreen group (relative odds, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.59 to 0.98]). β-Carotene supplementation had no overall effect on skin aging, although contrasting associations were seen in subgroups with different severity of aging at baseline. LIMITATION: Some outcome data were missing, and power to detect moderate treatment effects was modest. CONCLUSION: Regular sunscreen use retards skin aging in healthy, middle-aged men and women. No overall effect of β-carotene on skin aging was identified, and further study is required to definitively exclude potential benefit or potential harm.

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Sun damage is the most important environmental factor associated with malignant melanoma. To address the health threat, as well as the economic burden, primary prevention and early detection are crucial. OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of a topical sunscreen in the prevention of UV-induced effects in nevi. DESIGN: Prospective study of nevi protected by sunscreen vs a physical barrier. SETTING AND PATIENTS: Twenty-three nevi from 20 patients attending a referral hospital. INTERVENTION: Half of each nevus was protected by either a physical barrier or a sunscreen. Lesions were completely irradiated by a single dose of UV-B. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In vivo examination before and 7 days after irradiation and histopathologic-immunopathologic evaluation after excision on the seventh day. RESULTS: The most frequent clinical changes after UV radiation were pigmentation, scaling, and erythema; the most frequent dermoscopic changes were increased globules/dots, blurred network, regression, and dotted vessels. Both physical barrier- and sunscreen-protected areas showed some degree of these changes. More than 30% (7) of nevi did not show any change on clinical examination, and 18% (4) had no dermoscopic change. Immunohistopathologic differences between the halves of each nevus were demonstrable even when in vivo examination detected nothing. Parakeratotic scale, increased number and activation of superficial melanocytes, and keratinocyte proliferation were the most remarkable features. The only difference between both barriers was more enhanced melanocytic activation and regression features in the sunscreen group. No phenotypic features were found to predict a specific UV-B response. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Both physical barriers and sunscreens can partially prevent UV-B effects on nevi. Subclinical UV radiation effects, not always associated with visible changes, can develop even after protection. Sunscreens are not quite as effective as physical barriers in the prevention of inflammatory UV-B-induced effects.",

It is expected that laser treatment can generally deliver drugs into and across the skin, which is toxicologically relevant. The aim of this study was to establish skin absorption characteristics of antibiotics, sunscreens, and macromolecules via laser-treated skin and during postoperative periods. Nude mice were employed as the animal model. The skin received a single irradiation of a fractional CO2 laser, using fluences of 4-10 mJ with spot densities of 100-400 spots/cm(2). In vitro skin permeation using Franz cells was performed. Levels of skin water loss and erythema were evaluated, and histological examinations with staining by hematoxylin and eosin, cyclooxygenase-2, and claudin-1 were carried out. Significant signs of erythema, edema, and scaling of the skin treated with the fractional laser were evident. Inflammatory infiltration and a reduction in tight junctions were also observed. Laser treatment at 6 mJ increased tetracycline and tretinoin fluxes by 70- and 9-fold, respectively. A higher fluence resulted in a greater tetracycline flux, but lower skin deposition. On the other hand, tretinoin skin deposition increased following an increase in the laser fluence. The fractional laser exhibited a negligible effect on modulating oxybenzone absorption. Dextrans with molecular weights of 4 and 10 kDa showed increased fluxes from 0.05 to 11.05 and 38.54 μg/cm(2)/h, respectively. The optimized drug dose for skin treated with the fractional laser was 1/70-1/60 of the regular dose. The skin histology and drug absorption had recovered to a normal status within 2-3 days. Our findings provide the first report on risk assessment of excessive skin absorption after fractional laser resurfacing.",

Athletes are at high-risk with frequent sun exposure during peak hours of ultraviolet radiation. The aim of this study was to identify attitudes, personal characteristics, and barriers associated with sunscreen use among a high-risk athlete population. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey study conducted in 290 collegiate athletes from April 2010 to June 2011 at Duke and Stanford Universities. RESULTS: The average athlete spent 4h per day and 10 months per year training outdoors. While 96% agreed that sunscreen helps prevent skin cancer, over 50% never used sunscreen and 75% used sunscreen 3 or fewer days/week. Having a coach or athletic administrator discuss photoprotection was significantly associated with sunscreen use. Predictors of sunscreen use were female gender, sunburns in the last year, belief at risk for skin cancer, knowing someone with skin cancer, and being worried about wrinkles, sun burns, or skin cancer. CONCLUSION: Continued identification of characteristics and barriers to sunscreen use can lead to targeted interventions and education in this high-risk group of collegiate athletes with early and elevated total lifetime ultraviolet exposure.",

There is little information regarding sunscreen acquisition behaviors or availability/access to products that may help reduce the risk of skin cancer in Hispanic communities. This study sought to understand perceptions regarding sun protection and skin cancer risk and whether the availability of over-the-counter sunscreen products differed in three Chicago neighborhoods with different ethnic compositions. METHODS: We drew on interviews with 65 adult Spanish speaking Hispanics (23-72 years) recruited from faith-based institutions to better understand sunscreen use perceptions. Commercial establishments open to the general public were physically canvassed to determine whether there were any differences in sunscreen products availability. RESULTS: Stores carrying sun protection products are nearly twice as common in non Hispanic White neighborhoods versus Hispanic. In addition, when sunscreens are available for sale, Hispanics have fewer sunscreens to choose from. DISCUSSION: Emergent themes that were elicited during the interviews revealed that barriers to increased sunscreen use include economic and erroneous perceptions regarding skin cancer incidence and risk. Environmental factors that may reinforce these beliefs include lower availability and variety of sun protection products in Hispanic neighborhoods. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that providing culturally appropriate public health information encouraging the use of sunscreen and improving its availability in Hispanic communities are potential points of intervention in attempts to improve morbidity from skin cancer.",

Self-regulatory strategies such as action planning and coping planning are seen as proximal predictors of actual behavior. The study compares a pure planning intervention with a broader resource communication and examines differential effects at different stages of change. A sun safety online study was designed with two intervention groups (resource communication versus planning) and one control group at two assessment points, 2 weeks apart. Participants (N = 292) were grouped post hoc according to their stage of change, resulting in 51 pre-intenders (no intention to use sunscreen), 102 intenders (high intention but no regular use of sunscreen) and 139 actors (sunscreen use on a regular basis). No overall treatment effects on planning, but an interaction between time, stage and intervention emerged. The resource communication was more effective for pre-intenders, whereas the planning intervention proved more effective for intenders. A planning treatment was more beneficial in motivated individuals, whereas a broader approach was better for unmotivated ones.

Use of sunscreen has been shown to reduce this risk. OBJECTIVES: To identify patient and healthcare factors associated with sun-protective behaviours in organ transplant recipients after transplantation with the goal of increasing overall sunscreen use. METHODS: This study utilized a cross-sectional, retrospective survey from a national sample of 198 organ transplant recipients in the U.S.A. from 2004 to 2008 with no prior diagnosis of skin cancer. The main outcome measures were sunscreen use and sun avoidance before and after transplantation. Frequency of sunscreen use and sun exposure was obtained by self-report on Likert scales ranging from never to always, and these responses were converted to a numerical scale from 0 to 4. RESULTS: Overall sunscreen use increased after transplantation (from a score of 1·4 to 2·1, P < 0·001). Sex, Fitzpatrick skin type, receiving advice to avoid sun from a healthcare provider, and pretransplantation sunscreen use were significantly associated with frequency of post-transplantation sunscreen use in multivariate models. Pretransplantation sun exposure, advice to avoid sun and pretransplantation sunscreen use were significantly associated with sun avoidance post-transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Both patient features and clinician advice are associated with sun-protective behaviours after organ transplantation. These results will help physicians target expanded sun-protection counselling to those patients most in need of such intervention.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Health-care costs for the treatment of skin cancers are disproportionately high in many white populations, yet they can be reduced through the promotion of sun-protective behaviors. We investigated the lifetime health costs and benefits of sunscreen promotion in the primary prevention of skin cancers, including melanoma. METHODS: A decision-analytic model with Markov chains was used to integrate data from a central community-based randomized controlled trial conducted in Australia and other epidemiological and published sources. Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year was the primary outcome. Extensive one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the uncertainty in the base findings with plausible variation to the model parameters. RESULTS: Using a combined household and government perspective, the discounted incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained from the sunscreen intervention was AU$40,890. Over the projected lifetime of the intervention cohort, this would prevent 33 melanomas, 168 cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas, and 4 melanoma-deaths at a cost of approximately AU$808,000. The likelihood that the sunscreen intervention was cost-effective was 64% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of AU$50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. CONCLUSIONS: Subject to the best-available evidence depicted in our model, the active promotion of routine sunscreen use to white populations residing in sunny settings is likely to be a cost-effective investment for governments and consumers over the long term.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Each year more than 250,000 athletes participate on National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) teams. The majority of outdoor NCAA athletes, however, do not use sunscreen on a daily basis. Previous research notes that sunscreen availability represents the main barrier to use among collegiate athletes. OBJECTIVE: We sought to explore the effect of sunscreen availability on its application among outdoor collegiate athletes. METHODS: Participants (n = 83) on NCAA Division IA female golf teams were randomized to form treatment and control groups. Treatment group players placed study-supplemented sunscreen in their golf bags and locker rooms during the study period. Both groups completed self-administered surveys at the beginning and end of the 4-week investigation. RESULTS: The athletes for whom sunscreen was placed in the locker room and bags exhibited a statistically greater use of sunscreen at the end of the study compared with the control group (P = .01). Provision of readily available sunscreen in the locker room resulted in an average of 1.13 more days per week of sunscreen use, after adjustment for baseline use (P = .008). In addition, players with ready access to sunscreen during competitions increased their reapplication, although not significantly, by nearly 20% (P = .10). Sunscreen reapplication during practice did not change for either group. LIMITATIONS: Future investigations should target a larger population of both male and female outdoor collegiate athletes. CONCLUSIONS: The application of sunscreen increased significantly when athletes had easy access to sunscreen during practice and competition. These findings highlight a major opportunity to improve sun-protective behaviors among this vulnerable population.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To measure the thickness at which primary schoolchildren apply sunscreen on school day mornings and to compare it with the thickness (2.00 mg/cm(2)) at which sunscreen is tested during product development, as well as to investigate how application thickness was influenced by age of the child (school grades 1-7) and by dispenser type (500-mL pump, 125-mL squeeze bottle, or 50-mL roll-on). DESIGN: A crossover quasiexperimental study design comparing 3 sunscreen dispenser types. SETTING: Children aged 5 to 12 years from public primary schools (grades 1-7) in Queensland, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Children (n=87) and their parents randomly recruited from the enrollment lists of 7 primary schools. Each child provided up to 3 observations (n=258). INTERVENTION: Children applied sunscreen during 3 consecutive school weeks (Monday through Friday) for the first application of the day using a different dispenser each week. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Thickness of sunscreen application (in milligrams per square centimeter). The dispensers were weighed before and after use to calculate the weight of sunscreen applied. This was divided by the coverage area of application (in square centimeters), which was calculated by multiplying the children's body surface area by the percentage of the body covered with sunscreen. RESULTS: Children applied their sunscreen at a median thickness of 0.48 mg/cm(2). Children applied significantly more sunscreen when using the pump (0.75 mg/cm(2)) and the squeeze bottle (0.57 mg/cm(2)) compared with the roll-on (0.22 mg/cm(2)) (P<.001 for both). CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of age, primary schoolchildren apply sunscreen at substantially less than 1.00 mg/cm(2), similar to what has been observed among adults. Some sunscreen dispensers seem to facilitate thicker application than others.",

      "abstract": "The insect repellent N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) and sunscreen oxybenzone (OBZ) have been shown to produce synergistic permeation enhancement when applied concurrently in vitro and in vivo. The disposition of both compounds following intravenous administration (2 mg/kg of DEET or OBZ) and topical skin application (100 mg/kg of DEET and 40 mg/kg of OBZ) was determined in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Pharmacokinetic analysis was also conducted using compartmental and non-compartmental methods. A two-compartment model was deemed the best fit for intravenous administration. The DEET and oxybenzone permeated across the skin to accumulate in blood, liver and kidney following topical skin application. Combined use of DEET and oxybenzone accelerated the disappearance of both compounds from the application site, increased their distribution in the liver and significantly decreased the apparent elimination half-lives of both compounds (p < 0.05). Hepatoma cell studies revealed toxicity from exposure to all treatment concentrations, most notably at 72 h. Although DEET and oxybenzone were capable of mutually enhancing their percutaneous permeation and systemic distribution from topical skin application, there was no evidence of increased hepatotoxic deficits from concurrent application.",

A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted with 205 women (mean age 25 years) in three groups: motivational; volitional; and control. Sunscreen use, action planning, coping planning and coping self-efficacy were assessed at three points in time. The volitional intervention improved sunscreen use. Coping planning emerged as the only mediator between the intervention and sunscreen use at Time 3. Findings point to the role played by coping planning as an ingredient of sun protection interventions.",
