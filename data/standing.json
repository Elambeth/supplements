      "abstract": "Cellulose-based materials are emerging as versatile candidates for sustainable functional materials. This study presents a straightforward process to fabricate cellulose-based, self-standing films using 12 wt% microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) in an aqueous solution of 40 wt% tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAH). TBAH, as an out-of-equilibrium solvent capable of dissolving MCC, is utilized to fabricate self-standing cellulose films through gelation induced by cellulose I-cellulose II precipitation. The films exhibit moderate mechanical properties, with a Young's modulus approximately 460 MPa, tensile strength ranging from 1 to 4 MPa, and an elongation at break of about 2 %. The incorporation of zinc salts (0.2 M) does not significantly affect the overall mechanical properties. Their long-term stability is ensured by TBAH and zinc salts, both of which are known to prevent microbial growth. These films demonstrate a strong adsorption capacity for water-soluble contaminants like methylene blue, making them valuable for wastewater treatment and dye detection. Their multifunctional attributes position them as sustainable materials for advanced applications, including antimicrobial packaging, water purification systems, and potentially biomedical technologies. Overall, these cellulose-based films offer promising solutions for critical global challenges."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Most women suffering from urinary incontinence (UI) report that leakage occurs during everyday movement. These precise observations raise a potential association between standing postural control and UI. The aim of this systematic review is to compile studies investigating the link between standing postural control and UI, according to the presence or absence of UI, the severity of UI and bladder fullness. METHODS: This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Observational studies providing data on standing postural control in women with and without UI were considered for inclusion. RESULTS: Ten studies met the inclusion criteria, representing 4262 middle-aged and older active women. According to the modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment Scale, one was study rated as having a high risk of bias, 3 studies fair quality and 6 good quality. Four studies reported results using stabilographic measurement (p = 124 women). Six reported results using standing balance tests (p = 4138). All studies revealed some differences between UI and non-UI groups in standing postural control (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis provides a high level of evidence that women with UI have more impaired standing postural balance control than women without UI. According to the dual-task theory, worsening continence control is associated with a decline in standing postural balance, and conversely, a decline in standing postural balance is associated with the development of UI. Developing prospective planned physiotherapy intervention studies that address the impact of standing postural control interventions on UI signs and symptoms seems advisable."

      "abstract": "Vestibular sensation contributes to balance control during standing as well as somatosensation and vision. Previous studies have indicated that noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation (nGVS) activates vestibular function and improves standing balance in many subjects. However, the mechanism for improving balance control with the addition of nGVS remains unclear. This study aimed to clarify the balance control mechanism improved by nGVS using detailed motion data during quiet standing. Thirty-two young healthy subjects performed quiet standing tests for 40 s with their eyes closed under sham and optimal intensity stimulation. Detailed data consisting of the center of mass (COM) displacement and acceleration of the body, head acceleration, and lower and upper body accelerations were obtained from measurements using a force platform and a head inertial sensor based on the equations of motion of rigid body models. In addition, our study discusses the contributions of joint strategies for COM control and head acceleration control. The contributions of the ankle and hip strategies were calculated from the COM accelerations of the lower and upper bodies. The results indicated that the more effective group of nGVS suppressed head acceleration using the ankle strategy in the anteroposterior direction. This implies that acceleration feedback from vestibular function affects the quality of the ankle joint strategy control. The findings of this study could contribute to the evaluation of vestibular sensory weighting during standing and development of intervention methods for vestibular function using nGVS."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Individuals with a clinically complete spinal cord injury are unable to stand independently without external assistance. Studies have shown the combination of spinal cord epidural stimulation (scES) targeted for standing with activity-based recovery training (ABRT) can promote independence of standing in individuals with spinal cord injury. This cohort study aimed to assess the effects of stand-ABRT with scES in individuals with cervical chronic spinal cord injury. We evaluated the ability of these individuals to stand independently from physical assistance across multiple sessions. METHODS: Thirty individuals participated in this study, all unable to stand independently at the start of the intervention. Individuals were participating in a randomized clinical trial and received stand-ABRT in addition to targeted cardiovascular scES or voluntary scES. During the standing intervention, participants were asked to stand 2 h a day, 5 days a week for 80 sessions (Groups 1 and 2) or 160 sessions (Groups 3 and 4). RESULTS: A total of 3,524 training days were considered for analysis. Group 1 had 507 days, group 2 with 578 days, and 1152 and 1269 days for groups 3 and 4 respectively. 71% of sessions reached the two-hour standing goal. All individuals achieved outcomes of lower limb independent extension with spinal cord epidural stimulation, with a wide range throughout a training day. Sixteen participants achieved unassisted hip extension while maintaining unassisted bilateral knee and trunk extension. Participants receiving initial voluntary scES training performed better in unassisted bilateral knee and trunk extension than those receiving initial cardiovascular scES. The lower-limb standing activation pattern changes were consistent with the greater standing independence observed by all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with chronic cervical spinal cord injury were able to achieve various levels of extension without manual assistance during standing with balance assist following stand-ABRT with scES. These results provide evidence that scES modulates network excitability of the injured spinal cord to allow for the integration of afferent and supraspinal descending input to promote standing in individuals with spinal cord injury. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered on Clinical Trials.gov (NCT03364660) prior to subject enrollment.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Different studies on football players with fifth metatarsal stress fractures have found that hip internal rotation (HIR) range of motion is significantly reduced, while lateral forefoot pressure is significantly increased; therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether HIR range of motion is related to lateral plantar pressure. METHODS: The study included 120 college students (60 males and 60 females). HIR was measured using a smartphone inclinometer app in the prone position and a compass app in the supine position. Plantar pressure was assessed using the Gaitview® AFA-50 system during standing and walking. Correlation analysis was performed using SPSS 27.0. RESULTS: Among all subjects, HIR activity in the prone position was significantly negatively correlated with standing second through fourth metatarsophalangeal joints (MTPJ2-4), fifth metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ5), and midfoot (FM) pressures and significantly positively correlated with standing first toe (T1) pressure. During walking, there is a significant negative correlation between HIR in the prone position and MTPJ2-4, MTPJ5, FM, and lateral heel (LH). Similarly, in the supine position, HIR is significantly negatively correlated with MTPJ2-4, MTPJ5, FM, medial heel (MH), and LH. CONCLUSION: There is a significant negative correlation between HIR and lateral plantar pressure, indicating that reduced HIR is associated with increased lateral plantar pressure. Improving HIR through targeted rehabilitation may reduce lateral plantar pressure, offering new approaches for non-surgical treatment of little toe capsulitis and reducing the risk of fifth metatarsal stress fractures."

      "abstract": "Herein, a flexible and free-standing (substrate-free) PVDF/Ag2Se (Polyvinylidene fluoride) composite film was successfully fabricated through a combination of drop-casting and heat treatment. It was observed that when the drop-casted PVDF/Ag2Se composite film was heated above the melting point of PVDF, the small and separated Ag2Se crystalline grains in the composite film grow and interconnect to form a three-dimensional (3D) conductive network to increase the carrier mobility, while the molten PVDF effectively fills the network voids to enhance the flexibility and mechanical strength. As a result, both the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient of the composite films were significantly enhanced after heat treatment. The power factor of the PVDF/Ag2Se composite with a mass ratio of 1:4 at room temperature reached 488.8 μW m-1 K-2, among the best level of Ag2Se- or PVDF-based flexible and free-standing composite films. Bending tests demonstrated the superior flexibility of the hybrid film, with the electrical conductivity decreasing by only 10% after 1000 bending cycles. Additionally, a five-leg thermoelectric device achieved an impressive output power density of 1.75 W m-2 at a temperature difference (∆T) of 30 K. This study proposes an innovative strategy to enhance the thermoelectric performance and free-standing capability of organic-inorganic composite films, while achieving a competitive power factor and advancing the practical application of flexible thermoelectric devices."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Functional decline in gait motor control and the capacity to maintain balance during upright standing posture in older adults is influenced by deterioration in the complexity of various physiological systems involved in these daily activities. RESEARCH QUESTION: Is a 24-week dual-task protocol training, beginning with alternating cognitive demands and progressing to simultaneous dual-tasking, more effective than a control group training only with alternating dual tasks in improving the physiological complexity of postural control in older adults during upright standing posture under interoceptive and exteroceptive demands and gait under dual tasks? METHODS: This randomized controlled trial enrolled 60 community-dwelling older adults of both sexes, aged between 60 and 80. The experimental group (EG; n = 30) underwent training with progression from alternating dual-task (ADT) to simultaneous dual task (SDT) during activities such as gait, and static and dynamic functional balance. The control group (CG; n = 30) only underwent the ADT protocol throughout the six months of training. The primary outcome of this study was the physiological complexity of gait under dual task calculated by the refined composite multiscale fuzzy entropy method for the anteroposterior (AP), mediolateral (ML), and vertical (V) directions. The outcomes were acquired at baseline (T1) and after 24 weeks of intervention (T2). The analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle, using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with a significance level of 5 %. RESULTS: No interaction or group effects were observed. However, both groups significantly improved body sway physiological complexity in the AP direction during gait under ST, ADT, and SDT and in the V direction under ADT and SDT. No change in complexity during upright standing posture under interoceptive and exteroceptive demand was significantly observed, regardless of the group. SIGNIFICANCE: Regardless of the training protocol, both groups significantly improved the physiological complexity of gait under dual task."

CASE PRESENTATION: This case describes a 40-year-old Iranian woman with a decade-long history of nonspecific symptoms, including fatigue, widespread musculoskeletal pain, paresthesia, cognitive disturbances, and optic neuritis; misattributed to conditions such as fibromyalgia, hypothyroidism, and autoimmune diseases. Despite annual monitoring for normocytic anemia, her critically low vitamin B12 levels (< 150 pg/mL) and a diagnosis of pernicious anemia were identified only after persistent symptoms prompted further evaluation, revealing atrophic gastritis as the underlying cause. Neurologic improvement with parenteral B12 therapy, alongside management of fibromyalgia, emphasizes the importance of considering vitamin B12 deficiency even in the absence of classic hematologic findings. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the diagnostic challenges of pernicious anemia, where nonspecific symptoms and overlapping comorbidities obscure diagnosis, underscoring the need for a systematic, multidisciplinary approach and timely recognition of vitamin B12 deficiency to prevent irreversible complications.",

Animals Studied: One 20-year-old American Quarter Horse gelding and one 11-year-old pony mare were studied. Results: The presenting clinical signs, surgical technique, and postoperative results for two cases of iris hypoplasia treated with diode laser are described. Immediate postoperative complications-postoperative ocular hypertension (POH), corneal edema, and epithelial bullae-were possible anticipated effects but were controlled with topical medications in the first case. Following treatment, endothelial contact of the iris was eliminated, and a functional pupil was established in the first case. Anterior synechia occurred long-term but did not lead to pupil obstruction. Left untreated, the iris hypoplasia in the right eye progressed to a degree like that seen upon initial presentation in the left eye. In the second case, the area of the distended, hypoplastic iris was reduced, and the pupil remained functional. Conclusions: Diode laser ablation of hypoplastic iridal tissue was effective at eliminating anterior synechia in both cases presented here. The better functional results in Case 2 suggest that early intervention may result in more favorable outcomes."

Only a handful of cases of suprapubic cystostomy (SPC) site SCC have been reported and have been always seen in paraplegics or urethral stricture requiring long-standing catheterization. We report a case of a 69-year-old male with an indwelling (SPC) of 25 years duration for a urethral stricture who presented with a fungating growth around the SPC site enveloping the catheter confirmed to be squamous cell carcinoma. Imaging revealed involvement of abdominal wall and urinary bladder with no metastatic spread. He underwent wide local excision (WLE) of the lesion with radical cystectomy and ileal conduit reconstruction with bilateral ilio-inguinal lymphadenectomy and pedicled anterolateral thigh flap for abdominal wall reconstruction. He received adjuvant radiotherapy and was found to be recurrence free at 3 months. Among the cases previously reported, 9 of the 12 cases were treated surgically with 4 of those combined with partial cystectomy and 4 with radical cystectomy. SPC site SCC tends to be localized around the catheter and into the abdominal tract and wide surgical excision offers the best hope for cure. Regular cystoscopy and biopsy from bladder around the catheter site can help early detection and the treatment should be personalized to each patient."

      "abstract": "In Canada and the United States, many low-paid service providers are required to work long hours in a static standing posture. Women, young people, and low-paid workers are significantly more likely to report standing without moving at work. Prolonged sitting has received negative publicity, being associated with low caloric expenditure and, in some studies, with heart disease. Standing is often recommended, with static standing often conflated with walking. But prolonged standing has been associated with pain in the lower limbs and back, varicose veins, damage to arteries, heart disease, and problem pregnancies. Many US and Canadian jurisdictions such as the province of Quebec, Canada, include mandatory provision of seats in their occupational health regulations. Despite these regulations and subsequent jurisprudence, few cashiers, receptionists, or retail sales staff in these two countries can access seats at work. This article suggests some reasons for the lack of enforcement, describes efforts to transform this situation, and critically examines approaches to legislation, inspection, and intervention."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postural stability and muscle activity of older females were assessed during a sit-to-stand (STS) task completed from a standard North American toilet. Four STS toilet setups were examined: normal height (normalheight), raised seat (raisedseat), and normal and raised seats with bilateral grab bars (normalheightbars, raisedseatbars). METHODS: Eight older (72 ± 6 years) and 8 younger females (21 ± 1 years) participated. Total movement time, STS difficulty measured as the time from hindfoot to forefoot plantar pressure peaks, and center of pressure (COP) displacement were evaluated. Surface electromyography (EMG) captured muscle activity in the vastus medialis (VM), biceps femoris, calf muscles, and tibialis anterior (TA). RESULTS: Raisedseat, normalheightbars, and raisedseatbars reduced STS difficulty. Raising the seat reduced EMG activity in VM, TA, and calf muscles. Adding bars lowered biceps femoris and calf muscle EMG, and increased VM and TA activity. Normalheightbars and raisedseatbars lowered COP speed (P = .01) and displacement (P = .03) compared to normalheight and raisedseat. Conversely, raisedseat and raisedseatbars increased COP speed and displacement (P < .001) for young and older females. CONCLUSION: Normalheightbars provides the most stability and reduces STS difficulty, making it the best intervention for improving postural stability in older females standing up from a toilet.",

      "abstract": "Scapulothoracic dissociation (SD) is a rare and severe injury, typically associated with high-energy trauma. It is characterized by scapular displacement, often leading to neurovascular compromise. SD resulting from low-energy mechanisms, such as a fall from standing height, is exceptionally rare. We present the case of a 93-year-old male who sustained SD after a fall from standing height. He was hemodynamically unstable upon arrival, with progressive neurological deficits in the right upper limb. Computed tomography (CT) revealed an isolated right scapular glenoid fracture with lateral scapular displacement and a large hematoma, while CT angiography ruled out major vascular injury. Conservative management included hemodynamic stabilization and immobilization with a Velpeau-type splint. One month post-injury, neurological function in the affected upper extremity had significantly improved. By five months, the patient had regained nearly full, painless shoulder range of motion without neurological deficits. Although SD is classically associated with high-energy trauma, this case highlights its occurrence following minor trauma in elderly patients. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for SD in atypical presentations to facilitate early diagnosis and optimize treatment."

This study aimed to provide a current review of the literature (the \"current state of the art\") on lower third of the facial reanimation in restoring the voluntary and spontaneous smile in adult population using dual innervation free flap surgery. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature review of all relevant papers by searching the electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library. RESULTS: We included 12 retrospective studies involving 147 patients, five of which used the latissimus dorsi double innervation technique (42 patients) and seven of which investigated double innervation with a gracilis free flap (105 patients). In this review, we summarised the available data on smile recovery after free flap double innervation surgery. In half of the included studies, smiling was completely recovered. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that free flap surgery with dual innervation for long-term paralysis of the lower third of the face can guarantee comparable results using latissimus dorsi or gracilis free flaps. The best option depends on the case, taking into account the surgeon's skills and experience, as well as the patient's wishes and expectations."

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of dobutamine in escalating dosages on haemodynamic performance in awake and anaesthetised horses. STUDY DESIGN: Randomised cross-over experimental study. METHODS: Six healthy adult horses were enrolled, including both standing and isoflurane-anaesthetised experiments with 1-week washout. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, and thermodilution cardiac output (CO) were measured at baseline and at dobutamine infusion rates of 0.5, 1, and 2 mcg/kg/min. Arterial and mixed-venous blood was sampled, and oxygen delivery (DO2), oxygen extraction ratio (O2 ER), and fShunt were calculated. After confirming normal distribution, variables were compared with baseline and between groups using two-factorial ANOVA (alpha = 5%). RESULTS: MAP increased significantly during dobutamine infusion in both groups (Standing 92 ± 8 to 119 ± 8 mmHg, p < 0.001; Anaesthetised 58 ± 12 to 91 ± 16 mmHg, p < 0.001), and was significantly higher in awake versus anaesthetised horses at all time points (p < 0.001). CO increased significantly during dobutamine infusion (Standing 39 ± 5 to 68 ± 5 L/min, p < 0.001; Anaesthetised 21 ± 2 to 38 ± 3 L/min, p < 0.001), and was significantly higher in standing horses (p < 0.001). DO2 (p < 0.001) increased significantly, and O2 ER (p < 0.001) decreased significantly in both groups with dobutamine infusion. FShunt (p = 0.02) decreased significantly during dobutamine infusion in anaesthetised horses. MAIN LIMITATIONS: Small sample size; study performed in a lateral recumbency. CONCLUSIONS: Dobutamine produces a dose-dependent increase in CO and MAP and improves DO2 under standing and isoflurane-anaesthetised conditions. Dobutamine dosages of 2 mcg/kg/min reach standing baseline MAP and CO."

      "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease presenting with articular and extra-articular manifestations that could be related to genetic and environmental factors. Seropositive RA is marked by the presence of autoantibodies, which are associated with worse prognoses and increased risk of extra-articular manifestations, including cardiovascular diseases, lung disorders, and malignancies. Untreated RA can lead to substantial morbidity, reduced life expectancy, and poor quality of life. The development of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs has paved the way for improving disease outcomes and reducing morbidity and complications related to disease. However, adherence to therapy remains a challenge, often influenced by drug intolerance, misconceptions, and negative beliefs regarding potential side effects and drug toxicity. Here, we report three cases presenting with devastating complications due to long-standing untreated or inadequately treated seropositive RA. This emphasizes the huge disease burden and poor quality of life as part of the natural course and progression of untreated RA. Comprehensive patient education on the disease course, treatment benefits, and potential side effects is essential to enhance adherence and facilitate shared decision-making."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Macular hole (MH) duration is a prognostic indicator of posttreatment visual outcomes. The aim was to evaluate chronic (≥12 months) MH treatment using extended internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling. MATERIAL AND METHODS Medical records of patients with chronic MH treated with pars plana vitrectomy, ILM peeling (up to vascular arcades), and 20% SF6 tamponade were reviewed. Spearman correlation coefficient (r) examined relationships between MH duration and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). RESULTS Fifty patients were included (72.0% women; mean age, 73 years); mean (SD) MH duration was 19.1 (8.8) months. Most (76.0%) patients had a preoperative MH diameter >400 µm (mean [SD], 569.2 [164.6] µm). The MH was closed within 1 week in 46 (92.0%) patients. A significant improvement from baseline in BCVA was observed by month 1 after treatment (mean [SD] logMAR, 0.96 [0.38] vs 0.66 [0.25]; P<0.001). A moderate positive correlation was observed between MH duration and posttreatment BCVA (logMAR; r=0.40; P<0.01). Improvements in mean logMAR values through month 24 were similar when patients were stratified by MH diameter (≤400 vs >400 µm; P>0.05; all time points). Significant differences between patients with baseline MH diameter of ≤650 µm vs >650 µm were observed for BCVA (logMAR; P≤0.03; all time points). CONCLUSIONS Twenty-four month follow-up revealed a steady increase in visual acuity, with no symptom worsening. Vitrectomy, extended ILM peeling, and gas tamponade is effective for chronic MH closure, including for holes of up to 650 µm in diameter. A MH diameter >650 µm was associated with poorer BCVA results after treatment.",

It is a complex process encompassing multiple radiographic findings, including spondylolisthesis. Accurate characterization of the spondylolisthesis is important for the optimization of surgical treatment. OBSERVATIONS: A 56-year-old patient, whose medical history was significant for a posterior L4-S1 fusion performed about a decade earlier, presented with severe, refractory mechanical low back pain and lumbar radiculopathy for 1 year. Lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed mild L3-4 spondylolisthesis. Standing radiographs of the lumbar spine revealed marked worsening of the spondylolisthesis on neutral views, without significant change on flexion or extension. However, there was no spondylolisthesis present on computed tomography (CT) of the lumbar spine that revealed chronic bilateral pars defects. Dynamic instability was noted by comparison of the sagittal alignment of recumbent MRI and CT versus standing radiography in the neutral position. The patient was taken to the operating room for surgical stabilization, with resolution of symptoms. LESSONS: Comparison of sagittal alignment between standing radiography and recumbent MRI and CT of the lumbar spine revealed dynamic instability of the lumbar spondylolisthesis that was not otherwise fully appreciated on dynamic standing radiographs of the lumbar spine with flexion and extension views alone. https://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/CASE24555."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) usually demonstrate poor postural control due to impaired core muscle function. Dynamic neuromuscular stabilization (DNS) is based on developmental kinesiology principles, utilizing infant motor patterns to treat motor disorders. DNS has been shown to improve postural control in cerebral palsy patients by activating core muscle. However, whether the DNS approach is superior for enhancing core muscle contractility and postural control in CLBP patients still remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the effects of DNS training and conventional core exercises on core muscle contractility and standing postural control in CLBP patients. METHODS: Sixty CLBP patients were randomly assigned to a DNS group or a control group. Participants in the DNS group received DNS training, while those in the control group completed conventional core exercises. Both groups completed 12 sessions over 4 weeks (3 sessions/week, 50 min/session). Pre- and post-intervention evaluations included diagnostic musculoskeletal ultrasound to assess the change rate of core muscles (transversus abdominis (TrA), lumbar multifidus, and diaphragm), a balance assessment system to evaluate postural control performance (center of pressure displacement (COP)), and clinical questionnaires (Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ)) for pain intensity and disability. RESULTS: After 4 weeks, comparisons between both groups revealed significant statistical differences in the interaction effects of time*group. These differences were observed in the change rates of the left and right TrA (F1,58=4.820 and 3.964, p = 0.032 and 0.041), diaphragm change rate (F1,58=11.945, p = 0.001), as well as COP velocity (F1,58=5.283, p = 0.025), variability (F1,58=13.189, p = 0.001) in the anterior-posterior (AP) direction, COP path length (F1,58=6.395, p = 0.014), and COP area (F1,58=5.038, p = 0.029) in the eye-closed condition. DNS participants showed significantly greater muscle change rates and reduced COP (p < 0.05). The scores of VAS (F1,58=173.929, p = 0.001), ODI (F1,58=60.871, p = 0.001), and RDQ (F1,58=60.015, p = 0.001) decreased significantly over time, although no group differences were found between both groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: DNS is superior to conventional core exercises in enhancing core muscle contractility and standing postural control in CLBP patients, showing potential to reduce pain and improve disability. Its mechanism may involve the enhancement of proprioceptive feedback, particularly when visual feedback is blocked.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The integration of collaborative robots (cobots) in industrial settings has the potential to enhance worker safety and efficiency by improving postural control and reducing biomechanical risk. Understanding the specific impacts of varying levels of human-robot collaboration on these factors is crucial for optimizing cobot use. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the biomechanical effects of different levels of human-robot collaboration on postural stability and control during simulated working tasks. METHODS: A total of 14 participants performed simulated cashier working activities under 4 different collaboration modalities, with increasing levels of cobot assistance: full (Fu), half robot touch (HRT), half robot (HRb), and full robot (FRb). Center of pressure trajectories were extracted from 2 force plates' data to calculate 4 posturography parameters-mean distance (MDIST), mean velocity (MVELO), 95% confidence ellipse area (AREA-CE), and sway area (AREA-SW)-which were analyzed to assess the impact of cobot intervention on postural control. RESULTS: Nonparametric tests showed significance in the effect of the collaboration modalities on the 4 analyzed parameters. Post hoc tests revealed that FRb modality led to the greatest enhancement in postural stability, with a reduction in MDIST (4.2, SD 1.3 cm in Fu vs 1.6, SD 0.5 cm in FRb) and MVELO (16.3, SD 5.2 cm/s in Fu vs 7.9, SD 1.1 cm/s in FRb). AREA-CE and AREA-SW also decreased significantly with higher levels of cobot assistance (AREA-CE: 134, SD 91 cm² in Fu vs 22, SD 12 cm² in FRb; AREA-SW: 16.2, SD 8.4 cm²/s in Fu vs 4.0, SD 1.6 cm²/s in FRb). Complete assistance of the cobot significantly reduced interindividual variability of all center of pressure parameters. In FRb modality, as compared with all other conditions, removing the weight of the object during loading or unloading phases caused a significant decrease in all parameter values. CONCLUSIONS: Increased cobot assistance significantly enhances postural stability and reduces biomechanical load on workers during simulated tasks. Full assistance from cobots, in particular, minimizes postural displacements, indicating more consistent postural control improvements across individuals. However, high levels of cobot intervention also reduced the natural variation in how people balanced themselves. This could potentially lead to discomfort in the long run. Midlevel cobot assistance modalities can thus be considered as a good compromise in reducing biomechanical risks associated with postural stability at the same time granting a satisfactory level of user control.",

Cholesterol concentrations in VLDL (-0.15 mmol/l, p < 0.001), IDL (-0.11 mmol/l, p = 0.001) and small LDL C (-0.04 mmol/l, p < 0.001) decreased, while large LDL A cholesterol (0.07 mmol/l, p = 0.031) and LDL particle size (0.1 nm, p = 0.004) increased. CRP concentrations (0.95 mg/dl, p = 0.003) rose. CONCLUSIONS: Substituting sitting with standing and self-perceived light walking in free-living conditions, translates into lower CVD risk lipid and lipoprotein profiles in individuals who are overweight/obese. CRP significantly increased after the SitLess regimen.",

However, its relationship with age-related muscle changes and motor function and effective BIA assessment/intervention sites remains unclear. Herein, we evaluated age-related changes in PhA, explored the relationship between PhA and muscle mass, and identified effective sites for BIA. Methods: We included 131 healthy community-dwelling adults divided into older (≥65 years) and control (≤65 years) groups. PhA and muscle mass were measured using BIA with a device determining electrical resistance by transmitting a weak alternating current <90 μA. Motor function was measured using ground reaction force index, gait function, and grip strength. The relationships between muscle mass, PhA, and motor function were analyzed. Results: All values, excluding upper limb muscle mass, were lower in the older group, as were the rates of change in muscle mass and PhA in the lower limbs vs. the upper limbs. Lower limb PhA showed negative and positive correlations with the Timed Up and Go test and standing function, respectively; it was significantly associated with all motor functions. Conclusions: Regardless of age, muscle mass and PhA measured by BIA were high and low in the lower limbs, respectively, and lower limb PhA was related to walking and standing function. The decrease in lower limb muscle mass and PhA may accelerate with age. Given global population aging, easy-to-assess lower limb PhA linked to the movements necessary for independent living may be an effective site for assessment and intervention in clinical practice."

It is commonly advised to use footrests to relieve LBP. The impact of adjusting arm position on lumbar biomechanics can also be impressive. This study aimed to compare the effects of normalized footrest height and changing arm position on Gluteus medius (GMed) muscle activity, lumbar lordosis, and pain intensity. Twenty-four female pain developers (PDs) were recruited, identified by a > 10 mm increase on the visual analog scale (VAS) during prolonged standing. Electromyography (EMG) recorded GMed activity, and photogrammetry measured lumbar lordosis at time points over one hour-standing. The first group (A) used the footrest intermittently, while the second group (B) additionally changed their arm positions. These variables were analyzed using repeated measures (between/within) ANOVA. No significant interaction was observed between the groups in right and left GMed co-contraction index (CCI) (p =  0.14). However, both groups exhibited a significant decrease in CCI during prolonged standing (time *  condition: p =  0.003). Additionally, Group B consistently demonstrated lower overall levels of co-contraction across time (p =  0.01). An approximate 6-degree reduction in lumbar lordosis was observed after prolonged standing with both interventions (group A and group B; p =  0.008 and p =  0.01, respectively), although no significant differences in lumbar lordosis were detected between the groups. Lumbar discomfort increased over time; however, the interventions significantly alleviated this discomfort after the intervention time point. Notably, group B reported lower pain intensity compared to group A (p =  0.007). Applying these interventions in the workplace could be beneficial to reduce discomfort for individuals who stand for long periods of time. Further research is needed to optimize these strategies and assess long-term benefits.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Rehabilitation devices assist individuals with movement disorders by supporting daily activities and facilitating effective rehabilitation training. Accurate and early motor intention detection is vital for real-time device applications. However, traditional methods of motor intention detection often rely on single-mode signals, such as EEG or EMG alone, which can be limited by low signal quality and reduced stability. This study proposes a multimodal fusion method based on EEG-EMG functional connectivity to detect sitting and standing intentions before movement execution, enabling timely intervention and reducing latency in rehabilitation devices. METHODS: Eight healthy subjects and five spinal cord injury (SCI) patients performed cue-based sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transition tasks while EEG and EMG data were recorded simultaneously. We constructed EEG-EMG functional connectivity networks using data epochs from the 1.5-s period prior to movement onset. Pairwise spatial filters were then designed to extract discriminative spatial network topologies. Each filter paired with a support vector machine classifier to classify future movements into one of three classes: sit-to-stand, stand-to-sit, or rest. The final prediction was determined using a majority voting scheme. RESULTS: Among the three functional connectivity methods investigated-coherence, Pearson correlation coefficient and mutual information (MI)-the MI-based EEG-EMG network showed the highest decoding performance (94.33%), outperforming both EEG (73.89%) and EMG (89.16%). The robustness of the fusion method was further validated through a fatigue training experiment with healthy subjects. The fusion method achieved 92.87% accuracy during the post-fatigue stage, with no significant difference compared to the pre-fatigue stage (p > 0.05). Additionally, the proposed method using pre-movement windows achieved accuracy comparable to trans-movement windows (p > 0.05 for both pre- and post-fatigue stages). For the SCI patients, the fusion method showed improved accuracy, achieving 87.54% compared to single- modality methods (EEG: 83.03%, EMG: 84.13%), suggesting that the fusion method could be promising for practical rehabilitation applications. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that the proposed multimodal fusion method significantly enhances the performance of detecting human motor intentions. By enabling early detection of sitting and standing intentions, this method holds the potential to offer more accurate and timely interventions within rehabilitation systems."

      "abstract": "SUMMARY: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic disorder that affects millions of people worldwide, particularly the elderly population. Remission of T2D in elderly patients through lifestyle modifications has been well documented, especially in newly diagnosed patients with good glycemic control and without obesity. It is also common in patients with obesity undergoing bariatric surgery. In this report, we present the case of a 66-year-old male patient with a 30-year history of T2D and mild obesity who achieved remission of T2D through customized integrated intensive lifestyle modifications, including a vegan diet, exercise and psychological support. The patient showed an improvement in HbA1c (7.7 to 5.3%) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; 6.2 to 1.8) and a shift in BMI (25.3 to 23.7 kg/m2) through weight loss (73 to 67 kg). The patient remains in remission 33 months after the completion of the intervention. This case suggests the possibility of long-term remission with lifestyle changes in patients with advanced age, a longer duration of diabetes and mild obesity. LEARNING POINTS: Long-term sustained remission is possible in a geriatric patient with long-standing type 2 diabetes (T2D) of more than 30 years. Customized integrated intensive lifestyle intervention can lead to a significant improvement in glycemic control and insulin resistance in elderly patients with T2D. Integrated lifestyle interventions, including a vegan diet, exercise and psychological support, have the potential to stop the usage of oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin in an elderly patient with a prolonged history of T2D and mild obesity."

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to quantify whether interapical distance and coronal balance measured on 3D ultrasound (3DUS) images differed among 10 standing positions of participants with and without adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Apical vertebral translation (AVT) is an indicator of clinical symptoms and treatment outcomes in AIS. Stereoradiography simultaneously captures a frontal and lateral image, yet patients are required to elevate their arms during the examination and varied positioning may impact coronal plane measurements. Ultrasound can assess these measurements without exposing participants to radiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Females with and without AIS were recruited from a scoliosis clinic, and e-mail advertisements, respectively. Participants underwent 3DUS scans in 10 positions: standing; arms anteriorly supported in 60° of shoulder flexion; fingers to clavicles, chin, zygomatic processes, and eyebrows; shoulders abducted at 90° with hands open and thumbs on shoulders; hands on anterior wall with and without blocks; and hands unsupported. AVT and coronal balance measurements were obtained using custom software. Positions and groups were compared using repeated measures ANOVAs with Sidak pairwise comparisons. RESULTS: Fifty-nine females had a mean age, height, and weight of 17.5±4.9 years, 162.8±5.8 cm, and 56.2±10.6 kg, respectively. Seventeen single and 14 double curve participants were included with mean maximum curve angles of 26.4°±3.6° and 25.2°±3.1°, respectively. Overall, there were no statistically significant differences in interapical distance or coronal balance among the 10 positions, as well as in coronal balance between the groups ( P >0.05). The interapical distance of participants without AIS significantly differed from those with single curves in eight positions and from those with double curves in all 10 positions. CONCLUSIONS: The positions evaluated may be interchangeable for coronal plane lateral deviation measurements of females with AIS.",

Geographic proximity is a recognized barrier, thus, systemic infrastructure solutions through federal programs including General Clinical Research Centers and Clinical and Translational Science Awards have sought to improve accessibility. Even with such support, academic medical centers often have limited clinical research-dedicated space apart from shared exam rooms in difficult-to-navigate hospitals or clinics. In 2019, the Duke University School of Medicine looked beyond its medical center campus to identify free-standing sites within Durham communities for participant study visits. Catalyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Duke Research at Pickett, a 22 000-square-foot building with a laboratory, 30 exam rooms, and on-site parking, opened in October 2020 to support vaccine and treatment trials. Upon the lifting of many COVID-19 restrictions, and in partnership with the Research Equity and Diversity Initiative (READI) Community Advisory Council, the building was transformed to encourage community gatherings, education, and training programs. To date, Duke Research at Pickett has hosted 2692 participants in 78 research trials and 14 community-engaged activities."

The effectiveness of massage therapy as an intervention for managing leg pain associated with prolonged standing needs to be addressed. AIMS: This study aimed to evaluate the smart dynamic fabric actuator's effectiveness in treating chronic musculoskeletal leg pain in persons with occupations involving prolonged standing. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Thirty participants with chronic leg pain satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria participated in the study. The intervention group used the device for 15 minutes for each leg once a day and stretching exercises twice a day for six weeks. The control group performed stretching exercises twice a day for six weeks. The outcome was assessed at baseline, three weeks, and six weeks with a Numeric Rating Scale for pain and fatigue, short form-McGill Pain Questionnaire for pain, and SF-36 for quality of life. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The groups were compared using the two-sample t-test with equal variances, the two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and the Chi2 exact test as appropriate. RESULTS: Thirty medical (nursing officers and doctors) and nonmedical professionals (security guards and sales assistants) with a mean age of 32.9 ± 5.6 years (intervention group) and 36.2 ± 5.1 years (control group) participated in the study. At six weeks, a significant improvement in pain (4.80 ± 1.14 to 1.66 ± 1.04 vs 4.66 ± 0.89 to 2.6 ± 0.91, P = 0.014), quality of life (58.77 ± 9.06 to 71.76 ± 8.43 vs 51.39 ± 8.26 to 63.87 ± 7.61, P = 0.012), and reduced fatigue (5 to 2 vs 5 to 3, P = 0.003) was observed in the intervention group when compared with the control group. No adverse events were observed. CONCLUSION: A smart dynamic fabric actuator can be used as an adjunct to exercises for reducing leg pain and fatigue associated with prolonged standing."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This article critically examines long-standing groin pain (LSGP) in physically active adults related to sports overload by analyzing terminology, pathophysiology, and treatment. METHOD: This review is based on data from over 10,000 patients managed through a multidisciplinary algorithm. (LSGP) has been variably labeled, using terms that have led to inconsistencies in understanding its origin and management. Terms such as \"Pubic Inguinal Pain Syndrome,\" \"Sportsman's Groin,\" and \"Athletic Pubalgia\" have been proposed to standardize terminology and unify the classification of (LSGP). Pathophysiologically, (LSGP) is often due to tendinopathies affecting major tendons in the groin region, such as the adductors, iliopsoas, conjoint tendon, and inguinal ligament, often associated with weakness in the posterior wall of the inguinal canal. This condition frequently arises in sports involving abrupt directional changes and high-energy loads in the groin. Tendinopathies progress through reactive, reparative, or degenerative stages of tendinosis. RESULTS: Literature supports a multidisciplinary approach involving surgeons, physiotherapists, sports medicine physicians, and orthopedists for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. Our algorithm focuses on both anatomical and functional factors in managing (LSGP). Initial conservative therapies aim to support tendon regeneration and load correction, while surgical interventions, such as laparoscopic hernioplasty, are reserved for non-responsive cases. From 2004 to 2024, 12,144 patients completed this protocol, with only 14% requiring surgery. Long-term follow-up demonstrated a low recurrence rate of tendinopathy and an absence of severe complications. CONCLUSION: Standardizing terminology, understanding pathophysiology, and utilizing a multidisciplinary approach are essential for optimizing the diagnosis and management of sports-related (LSGP).",

Therefore, improving balance control is a key priority in the management of knee osteoarthritis (OA), underscoring the importance of accurately assessing standing balance. PURPOSE: To assess reliability, construct validity and responsiveness of common clinical balance tests, including Step Test, Single-Leg Stance Test, and Functional Reach Test, in patients with knee OA. METHODS: In the initial session, 100 participants underwent balance tests and completed Persian-version of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) as comparators for evaluating the construct validity of balance tests. For test-retest reliability, a subset of 70 participants repeated balance tests 1 week after initial assessment. To examine responsiveness, a subset of 90 participants underwent tests and completed WOMAC and TUG at baseline and after completing intervention. At post-intervention assessment, participants also completed global rating of change scale. RESULTS: Three balance tests showed excellent test-retest reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient >0.75). All balance tests were considered valid and responsive because they confirmed 100% of priori hypotheses. Minimal detectable change (MDC) values were 2.71 steps for Step Test, 7.15 seconds for Single-Leg Stance Test, and 4.90 centimeters for Functional Reach Test. Minimal important change (MIC) values were 4.5 steps for Step Test, 13.10 seconds for Single-Leg Stance Test, and 5.5 centimeters for Functional Reach Test. CONCLUSION: Three tests are reliable, valid and responsive for measuring balance in patients with knee OA. The MIC values aid clinicians and researchers in assessing the clinical relevance of changes in balance for these patients."

No significant effects between trials nor trial × time interaction was found for [glucose] or [insulin] (all p > 0.05). The postprandial iAUC did not differ for [glucose] (p = 0.824; SIT: 222 ± 83 mmol/L; STAND: 225 ± 90 mmol/L) or [insulin] (p = 0.269; SIT: 17507 ± 9738 pmol/L; STAND: 15649 ± 10181 pmol/L).

Although the precise mechanism of ITP is not yet fully understood, a therapeutic approach that relies on using a single agent in each treatment line may not be sufficient in this population. We report the case of a 67-year-old female with long-standing multi-refractory ITP treated with a combination of Daratumumab and Romiplostim who achieved a durable response for more than 42 weeks. Owing to the presentation of chronic and refractory disease, we used a dual-agent approach to address early immune destruction and promote megakaryocyte platelet production. Three doses of Daratumumab were administered during the induction phase (weeks 0,1,5) and then at less frequent intervals - every 4-12 weeks for total of 4 doses during the maintenance phase. Romiplostim was administered weekly, with dose modification depending on the platelet count. We hypothesize that when combined with thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs), daratumumab administered at less frequent intervals over an extended period can be safely used, resulting in a prolonged response."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several studies have explored the advantage of treatment with hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) for upper extremity lymphedema in irradiated breast cancer patients and reported controversial results. This prospective case series aimed to document the short- and long-term efficacy of this therapy, focusing on the arm volume and functional assessment in breast cancer patients with a history of long-standing lymphedema for more than 2 years. CASE: Six breast cancer patients with long-standing lymphedema were enrolled. All of them received breast surgery and dissection of axillary lymph nodes, chemotherapy, and postoperative radiotherapy. The average duration from the onset of lymphedema to HBO treatment was 9 ± 5.92 years (range 2-17). All patients were treated for 90 min in the HBO chamber with 100% oxygen at a higher pressure of two times the atmospheric pressure, five times a week for 30 sessions. We measured the circumference of both arms and calculated the arm volume before treatment (baseline), after 30 sessions of treatment, and after treatment at 3, 6, and 24 months. Functional assessment focused on the ability of the arm, shoulder, and hand using the Thai Quick-DASH questionnaires, which were assessed by the patients at the same periods. The change of arm volume and Thai Quick-DASH score at each time point were compared to the starting point data before HBO. CONCLUSION: The change of arm volume and mean Quick-DASH score had decreased at 3, 6, and 24 months after treatment compared to the starting point before HBO, However, these changes were not statistically significant.",

The convergent procedure is a valid ablation option for the treatment of long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation. AIM: To describe the outcomes of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation who underwent the convergent procedure. METHODS: We studied consecutive patients included in two French centres between 2009 and 2020. Primary endpoint was freedom from any atrial arrhythmia assessed on 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram at 3, 6 and 12 months after the procedure. Left ventricular ejection fraction was assessed on transthoracic echocardiography before and 1 year after the procedure. All patients had at least 12 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Forty-three patients were included (86% were men). Baseline left ventricular ejection fraction was 38±10.5% and indexed left atrial volume was 50±27mL/m2. Among the study population, 34 patients (79%) were free from atrial fibrillation/tachycardia at the end of follow-up. No periprocedural death occurred. We observed two groin haematomas and four mild pericardial effusions. At 12-month follow-up, 21 patients (49%) were still on antiarrhythmic drug therapy, and a reduction in antiarrhythmic drug dosage was achieved in 10 patients (23%). The absolute median improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction was 8% at 12 months (P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: The convergent procedure has been shown to be effective and safe for patients with patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation, with significant left ventricular function improvement.",

The resulting free-standing TEMPO-BC/HAPNW filter membrane exhibited strong mechanical strength, high flexibility, exceptional deformability, and a high pure water flux of up to 800 L·m-2·h-1 due to its porous architecture and inherent hydrophilicity. Additionally, the filter membrane demonstrated long-term high rejection efficiency towards TiO2 nanoparticles and methylene blue through size exclusion and electrostatic interaction. Notably, the surface wettability of the composites switched to being hydrophobic and lipophilic after in situ modification, enabling superior separation of various organic solvents and oils while maintaining cycle stability.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Medullary thyroid cancer often results in elevated calcitonin levels, which can cause localized formation of calcitonin amyloid, though rarely complications of systemic calcitonin amyloidosis have been reported. The objective of this report is to encourage awareness of calcitonin amyloid causing nephrotic syndrome in patients with metastatic medullary thyroid cancer. CASE REPORT: A 65-year-old woman with weakness, fatigue, anasarca, anemia, thrombocytopenia, venous and arterial thrombi, and a cavitary right lung lesion was transferred for care. She had a 14-year history of metastatic medullary thyroid cancer, status post-thyroidectomy and tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, adrenocorticotropic hormone-dependent Cushing syndrome in remission, and recently diagnosed nephrotic syndrome. On admission, she had lower extremity edema and scattered ecchymoses. Labs showed creatinine 0.62 mg/dL (0.7-1.3 mg/dL), morning cortisol >119.6 ug/dL (4-23 ug/dL), adrenocorticotropic hormone 426 pg/mL (6-50 pg/mL), 24-hour urine cortisol 6115.2 mcg/24 h (4-50 mcg/24 h), calcitonin 39 373 pg/mL (≤5 pg/mL), and carcinoembryonic antigen level 484.8 ng/mL (0-4.9 ng/mL). Kidney biopsy showed amyloidosis, which stained positive for calcitonin. DISCUSSION: Systemic calcitonin amyloidosis is not well-documented in medullary thyroid cancer. To our knowledge, there are 2 previous case reports describing nephrotic syndrome secondary to calcitonin amyloid in the setting of medullary thyroid cancer. CONCLUSION: This case supports a small body of evidence that metastatic medullary thyroid cancer can result in systemic calcitonin amyloidosis and its complications, including nephrotic syndrome. Clinicians should consider nephrotic syndrome as a potential complication in patients with metastatic medullary thyroid cancer, particularly in those with long-standing calcitonin elevation and characteristic symptoms."

LP is a rare cause of nephrotic syndrome in SLE patients with implications for prognosis and treatment. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 28-year-old woman with a medical history of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who presented with lower limb edema, dyspnea, hypercholesterolemia, with nephrotic range proteinuria, without acute kidney injury, and laboratory findings compatible with auto-immune hemolytic anemia. They had negative infectious serology, positive antinuclear antibody (ANA), and an eye fundus examination showing diabetic retinopathy. A biopsy was performed to define the etiology of the renal involvement, which was compatible with LP. Following immuno-suppressive and antiproteinuric therapy, the patient evolved with the complete remission of the nephrotic syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Lupus podocytopathy is an infrequent anatomopathological entity, so this case is presented as the first reported in Peru, and a literature review is made.",

Robotic assistive devices offer potential to enhance mobility, promoting community engagement and quality of life. This is an observational report of 22 cases of children with CP in which we evaluated the Moonwalker exoskeleton (a dynamic moving aid system) usability, functional changes, and caregivers' perspectives based on the International Classification of Functioning (ICF). All children (aged 2-8 years, with a severe gait impairment and inability to use a conventional walker) underwent Moonwalker training for 20 sessions, followed by home use for five months. Post-treatment, majority of children showed improved endurance assessed by the 10-m walk test with a notable involvement of the upper trunk and arm movements for gait assistance. Many of them achieved rather remarkable results reaching a velocity of ≥0.5 m/s given the constraints of the walking exoskeleton and the children's size, while at admission all children walked at a speed of less than 0.5 m/s. Several positive environmental factors and family adherence were noted, as assessed by ICF in a subgroup of children. This study on a sample of children demonstrated that the Moonwalker exoskeleton allows walking and training at home in children with severe CP, enhancing development, social interaction, and endurance, while being well-received by families."

This study aimed to assess the effects of utilizing a standing desk on the craniovertebral angle, muscle fatigue, work performance, and discomfort in individuals with forward head posture. Twenty-four participants meeting the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to either a traditional desk group (n = 12) or a standing desk group (n = 12). Each group engaged in 30 min of computer typing. To evaluate the impact of posture change using a standing desk, pre- and post-experiment discomfort surveys were conducted, and the craniovertebral angle and muscle fatigue were measured throughout the experiment. Work performance was assessed post-experiment based on the work completed by the participants. Intra-group analysis of the craniovertebral angle showed a significant decrease in the traditional desk group (p < 0.05) and a significant increase in the standing desk group (p < 0.05). When comparing the craniovertebral angle between the two groups, a significant difference was observed (p < 0.05). Additionally, significant differences in muscle fatigue, particularly in the levator scapulae muscles, were observed between the two groups (p < 0.05). The traditional desk group reported increased discomfort in the neck and shoulders (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that utilizing a standing desk can positively impact posture, reduce muscle fatigue, and alleviate discomfort in individuals with forward head posture, potentially serving as an intervention to prevent musculoskeletal disorders."

      "abstract": "Varicocele, one of the main diseases affecting male reproductive health, relies heavily on angiographic diagnostic techniques for disease-related examination and assessment. Traditional varicocele angiography often employs a supine position to facilitate the relaxation of the groin area muscles, the insertion of the angiography catheter, and imaging. However, the supine position may cause blood reflux, thus underestimating the clinical incidence of varicocele, particularly resulting in missed diagnoses of right-sided or bilateral varicoceles. To address this issue, this study proposes the combined use of supine and standing positions for varicocele imaging. The standing position increases lower abdominal pressure, making the degree of varicosity more prominent in the images. Compared to the sole use of the supine position, the method employed in this study effectively reduces the misdiagnosis rate of right-sided or bilateral varicoceles. This approach aims to facilitate the early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of varicocele, effectively reducing the potential threat of the disease to male reproductive health. It also helps improve the accuracy of disease assessment, providing more references for selecting subsequent treatment plans.",

This study aimed to examine the acute neuromuscular effects of physical exercise consisting of repeated jumps of randomized length. Fifteen healthy young participants completed 2 separate sessions of 90 minutes. They did 20 minutes of fatiguing exercise, consisting of 100 repeated standing long jumps (SLJ), in two different manners: one session with targeted jump length kept constant (CO), and one with targeted jump length being varied and unpredictable (RA). Pre- and post-tests were conducted before and immediately after, including measurements of Countermovement Jump (CMJ), SLJ, leg extension maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MViC), EMG activities of leg muscles and patellar tendon reflex amplitude (T-reflex: strike force and evoked force). Results showed that performances decreased after the repeated SLJs, independently of the condition (MViC decreased from 448 ± 118 N to 399 ± 122 N; CMJ decreased from 36.7 ± 7.2 cm to 34.6 ± 6.6 cm). EMG during MViC decreased by 21 ± 28 % from pre- to post-intervention. T-reflex decreased after both conditions ([Force/Strike] ratio decreased by 38 ± 69 % from pre to post). Subjective measures showed a greater sense of personal performance and enjoyment after the RA session. Results suggest that a randomly organized intensity of effort led to a similar decrease in physical performance compared to constant intensity when the session loads were matched. It also led to similar fatigue of the neuromuscular system as shown by T-reflexes and EMG measures. Nonetheless, random practice presents the benefit of being markedly more appreciated by participants.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In rehabilitation practices, expert therapists are believed to proficiently observe and assist patients. However, limited research has quantified the gaze behaviors of physical therapists during patient support. This study investigated the gaze patterns of expert and novice physical therapists from a first-person perspective during the process of assisting collaborators to stand. The aim was to determine which body parts received prolonged attention and to explore the characteristics of the support provided. METHODS: Seven experienced physical therapists were recruited as expert participants, and 17 physical therapy students served as novice participants. We also recruited additional students as collaborators and asked them to behave as if they were patients. Both expert and novice participants wore a wearable eye tracker while assisting the collaborators to stand. We analyzed the gaze focus on specific body parts and the center of mass sway of the collaborators. RESULTS: Experts spent 10.75% of the total time gazing at the head area, compared to 4.06% for novices, with experts displaying significantly longer gaze durations (p < .05). Furthermore, there was a significant difference in the number of gaze fixations, with experts averaging 25.71 fixations and novices 8.65 (p < .05). Experts also facilitated a slower sway in the collaborator's center of mass (0.44 m/s for experts vs. 0.49 m/s for novices; p < .01) and positioned the collaborator with a more pronounced trunk flexion during sitting and standing transitions (41.0 degrees for experts vs. 37.8 degrees for novices; p < .01). DISCUSSION: The findings suggest that experts may monitor the collaborator's center of mass position by focusing on the head area. Properly positioning the head forward may allow for optimal forward movement of the center of mass, potentially reducing the effort required by the collaborator to stand. This study is the first to explore differences in support strategies through the measurement of physical therapists' gaze during assistance."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Parkinson's patients will experience mobility disturbances with disease progression. Beneficial effects of physical therapy are short-lasting. Novel interventions are needed to maintain these benefits. METHODS: Fourteen Parkinson's patients (71±4.08 years) participated in a randomized controlled examiner-blinded feasibility clinical trial. After 12 physical therapy sessions, the intervention group received a height-adjustable desk that facilitates stepping while standing, for 4 months. Explorative outcome measures included MDS-UPDRS II, III, TUG, 8.5m walking test, PDQ-39, sABC, sFES, DEXA scans, and lower extremity strength. RESULTS: Post-physical-therapy, everyone significantly improved on the MDS-UPDRS II, III, TUG, and 8.5m walking test, and PDQ-39. (p<0.05) After 4 months, the control group regressed towards pre-physical-therapy values. In the intervention group, sedentary behavior decreased beyond desk use, indicating a carry-over effect. MDS-UPDRS II, PDQ-39, sFES, sABC, TUG, 8.5m walking test, activity time, sitting time, hip strength all improved with clinically relevant effect sizes. CONCLUSION: Post-physical therapy in-home reduction of sedentary behavior was associated with maintenance of physical benefits and additional improvements in mobility, activity time, balance and quality of life."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Asthma in the elderly is usually considered homogeneous and non-atopic. OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical, functional and immunological features between elderly asthmatics with long-standing asthma (LSA) and those with late-onset asthma (LOA). METHODS: Eighty-two asthmatics older than 64 were included into LSA (asthma onset before age 40; n = 46) and LOA (asthma onset from 40 years of age on; n = 36) groups. Asthma treatment and comorbidities were recorded. All individuals underwent the asthma control questionnaire-7 (ACQ-7) and cognitive impairment screening (Mini-Mental State Examination). Inhaler technique was assessed by checklists; the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8 was used to assess adherence to treatment. Spirometry, skin prick tests (SPTs), induced sputum and blood eosinophil counts were performed. RESULTS: We found high frequencies of cognitive impairment, poor inhaler technique and low adherence to treatment in both groups, which had good disease control (ACQ-7 scores: 1.20 ± 0.74 versus 1.11 ± 0.89; p = 0.67, respectively). The LSA group had more severe airway obstruction (FEV1(% predicted): 62.04 ± 19.50 versus 77.15 ± 18.74, p < 0.01; FEV1/FVC: 0.59 ± 0.10 versus 0.69 ± 0.09, p < 0.01); higher frequency of positive SPTs (65.6% versus 18.8%, p = 0.001); and lower frequency of blood eosinophilia (45.7% versus 77.1%, p = 0.004) than the LOA group. No differences in sputum cell counts or inflammatory profiles were found between the groups. Ninety percent of the individuals studied had at least one feature of Type 2 asthma. CONCLUSION: LSA and LOA phenotypes differ substantially. That should be accounted for in research and clinical practice grounds.",

      "abstract": "The current assessment of Parkinson's disease (PD) relies on dynamic motor tasks, limiting accessibility. This study aimed to propose an innovative approach to identifying PD and its stages using static standing balance and machine learning. A total of 210 participants were recruited, including a control group and five PD groups categorized by stage. Each participant completed a 10-s static standing balance task in which center of pressure trajectory data in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior directions were collected. Features were extracted from these trajectory data and the data derived from them using both representation learning and handcrafting methods. A Transformer encoder-based classifier was trained on these features and achieved an F1-score of 0.963 in classifying the six study groups. This approach enhances the accessibility of PD assessment, enabling earlier detection and timely intervention. The novel data mining framework introduced in this study heralds a new era of time-series data-driven digital healthcare."

DESIGN: Explorative ancillary analysis of two different prospective clinical trials with two different endpoint timelines. METHODS: 202 adolescents with either PFP or OSD were included. ActiGraph GT3X + objectively measured sedentary time before, during, and after adolescents were instructed to modify sports participation, requiring a minimum of 4 days with 10 h of wear time. Daily sedentary time was calculated from ≥10 min of consecutive bouts. RESULTS: 138 adolescents with PFP and 47 with OSD were eligible for inclusion. Adolescents with PFP had a non-significant increase of 14min/day change in sedentary time from baseline to during the activity modification. Adolescents with OSD had non-significant increases of 9min/day and 0min/day in sedentary time from baseline to immediately following the activity modification period and at the 12 weeks follow-up. There was variability in the individual adolescents' sedentary time during the intervention.

Various complications have been cited including retinopathy, nephropathy, peripheral artery disease and ulceration among others. However, rarer complications such as diabetic myonecrosis are limited in literature. This case report demonstrates the presentation of this complication to allow for earlier detection and treatment by providers. CASE REPORT: This case highlights a 49-year-old man with an extensive past medical history inclusive of diabetes mellitus type 2, who presented with acute onset left thigh pain and swelling. On presentation, the patient has an HbA1c of 8 % and hyperpigmented spots were noted bilaterally on the lower extremities. Initial management was centered around infectious etiologies and management which failed to improve his symptoms. Further work-up included a negative lower extremity duplex ultrasound and a CT scan showing a hypodense lesion in the left lower extremity. Following unsuccessful drainage of the lesion to assess for a possible abscess, MRI of the lower extremities showed bilateral myositis and myonecrosis centered in the left vastus medialis. CONCLUSION: This case report highlights a rare complication of diabetes mellitus known as diabetic myonecrosis (DMN). The gold-standard diagnostic tool is a muscle biopsy, however, sensitive imaging like MRI and clinical context are sufficient for a diagnosis. Supportive care centered around pain management remains the standard of care. While this remains as a diagnosis of exclusion, early identification may decrease the number of unnecessary treatments and should remain as a differential in patients with this presentation.",

This uses a vortex fluidic device (VFD) where induced mechanical energy and photo-contact electrification associated with the dynamic thin film in the rapidly rotating tube tilted at 45° while simultaneously UV irradiated (λ=254 nm, 20 W) results in decomposition of water to hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide with growth of the gold nanoparticles on the surface of the GO. We have established that the resulting Au@GO composite sheets rapidly catalyse the degradation of commercial dyes like methyl orange (MO) and methylene blue (MB) using the hydrogen peroxide generated in situ in the VFD. This process relies on active radicals generated through liquid-solid photo-contact electrification of water in the VFD which dramatically minimises the generation of waste in industrial applications, with the reaction having implications for wastewater treatment."

In this study, free-standing carbon nanofiber (CNF) films with supported cobalt phosphide nanoparticles have been prepared by means of an up-scalable electrospinning process followed by a thermal treatment under controlled conditions. The produced cobalt phosphide-supported CNF films show to be nanoporous (pore volume up to 0.33 cm3 g-1) with a high surface area (up to 502 m2 g-1) and with a suitable catalyst mass loading (up to 0.49 mg cm-2). Values of overpotential less than 140 mV at 10 mA cm-2 have been reached for the HER in alkaline media (1 M KOH), which demonstrates a high activity. The high electrical conductivity together with the mechanical stability of the free-standing CNF films allowed their direct use as cathodes in a MEC reactor, resulting in an exceptionally low voltage operation (0.75 V) with a current density demand of 5.4 A m-2. This enabled the production of H2 with an energy consumption below 30 kWh kg-1 H2, which is highly efficient."

However, data regarding CBA for long-standing persistent AF (PeAF) are limited. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of CBA for long-standing PeAF compared to PeAF. METHODS: The study included 1484 patients with non-paroxysmal AF from Korean CBA registry data with follow-up of > 12 months after de novo CBA. The primary outcome was recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATs) of ≥ 30-s after a 3-month blanking period. RESULTS: A total of 367 PeAF (25%) and 1117 long-standing PeAF (75.3%) patients (mean age 61.9 ± 9.6 years, 80% men) underwent de novo CBA. Compared to patients with PeAF, patients with long-standing PeAF had more heart failure, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, chronic kidney disease, higher CHA2DS2-VASc score, and larger left atrium (LA). During a mean follow-up period of 15.1 ± 10.9 months, ATs recurrence occurred in 41.4% of PeAF and 40.1% of long-standing PeAF. Multivariate analysis showed that female gender (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.31, p = 0.01), larger LA ≥ 45 mm (HR: 1.53, p < .001) and LA volume index ≥ 51 mL/m2 (HR: 1.77, p < 0.001), and longer AF duration ≥ 5 years (HR: 1. 33, p = .003) were associated with ATs recurrence. After propensity score matching, larger LA was an independent factor for ATs recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: During a long-term follow-up period after index CBA in patients with non-paroxysmal AF, ATs recurrence rate was similar between PeAF and long-standing PeAF. CBA might be an effective strategy as an initial rhythm control therapy regardless of AF type.",

This study investigates Gallium-doped Zinc Oxide (GZO), composed of abundant and non-toxic elements, to fabricate a substrate-free GZO film via 3D printing and compares its structural, chemical, and thermoelectric properties with those of a substrate-constrained GZO film produced through chemical deposition. Both films exhibited uniform crystal structures and phase purity; however, the substrate-constrained film displayed additional diffraction peaks, suggesting potential substrate interactions. The 3D-printed free-standing film effectively eliminated the tensile stresses observed in the substrate-constrained film. FE-STEM analysis revealed nanostructures with homogeneous elemental distribution in both films, though the substrate-constrained film showed discontinuities, such as pores, likely caused by post-deposition annealing treatment. XPS analysis highlighted differences in chemical states and elemental compositions between the films, influenced by fabrication methods, substrate-induced stresses, and surface energy mismatches. The free-standing GZO film developed through 3D printing exhibited a more balanced incorporation of Zn and O, as it was not subject to substrate or post-deposition annealing constraints. Consequently, it demonstrated a 14 % increase in electrical conductivity and a 91 % improvement in the Seebeck coefficient compared to the substrate-constrained film, resulting in a higher room-temperature power factor of 261 nW/m·K2. These findings underscore the potential of 3D-printed free-standing GZO films to advance thermoelectric applications, offering a promising alternative to overcome the challenges of substrate-constrained films and further drive innovation in the field."

We aim to compare mitral valve repair combined with the maze procedure with catheter ablation in patients with severe atrial functional mitral regurgitation due to long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with severe atrial functional mitral regurgitation and long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation were included in this retrospective cohort study. Surgical patients underwent mitral valve repair combined with the Cox maze procedure, whereas catheter patients underwent catheter radiofrequency ablation. Mortality, atrial fibrillation recurrence, and HF readmission were assessed using overlap propensity score weighting. Then, between 2018 and 2022, we identified 302 patients: 215 in the surgical group and 87 in the catheter group. There were significant differences in the baseline characteristics between groups. The surgical group had lower rates of atrial fibrillation recurrence (P=0.03), HF readmission (P=0.03), and mitral regurgitation grade >2 at discharge (P<0.01) and follow-up (P<0.01). However, there were no significant differences in the 5-year freedom from death (log-rank P=0.87), atrial fibrillation recurrence (log-rank P=0.36), or HF readmission rates (log-rank P=0.18). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with surgical patients, the catheter group had higher atrial fibrillation recurrence and HF readmission rates; however, the difference was not significant after overlap propensity score weighting. Although the proportion of patients with significant mitral regurgitation at the last follow-up was higher after catheter ablation, most patients still showed an effective decrease in mitral regurgitation severity.",

      "abstract": "Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the second most common cutaneous non-melanoma cancer in Mexico, accounting for 20% of all skin cancers. It is considered a global public health concern due to the rising incidence and prevalence, which is associated with an aging population. Treatment for cSCC depends on the severity of the disease, which determines different therapeutic approaches. Reconstructive surgery, as a treatment option, has seen significant advancements over the years, offering new opportunities to improve the quality of life for cSCC patients. Modern surgical techniques require both an aesthetic focus and effective reconstruction to meet the desires and expectations of patients. We present the case of a patient with long-standing SCC located in a facial area that is difficult to access for surgical resection and reconstruction, presenting a therapeutic challenge while achieving an aesthetically harmonious scar."

      "abstract": "Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a circulating hormone released from the atria in response to wall stretch and volume overload in the setting of heart failure. When atrial fibrillation (AF) becomes long-standing persistent, ANP secretion in response to volume overload is impaired due to degenerative changes of the atria. Here, we report a case of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and impaired ANP secretion due to long-standing AF. N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level was elevated (269 pg/mL), whereas the increase in ANP level was marginal (46.1 pg/mL), suggesting impaired ANP secretion due to long-standing AF. Valsartan (80 mg/day) was replaced with sacubitril/valsartan (100 mg/day) without changing other medications. Administration of sacubitril/valsartan was effective in improving the patient's symptoms, such as dyspnea and edema, and reducing NT-proBNP level by increasing endogenous ANP level from 46.1 pg/mL to 117 pg/mL in the first four weeks. This case highlights the possibility of impaired ANP secretion in response to volume overload as a predictor of the diuretic effect of sacubitril/valsartan in heart failure. This may lead to individualized treatment for each patient with heart failure based on natriuretic peptide profiles."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Over the past few years, the sport psychology literature has established that gender stereotype threat (ST) is one of the factors that can impair girls' performance. However, few studies have attempted to annihilate these negative effects. The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether questioning gender ST can mitigate the classical decline in girls' standing long jump (SLJ) performance. METHODS: The participants were 120 girls (Mage = 10.74 ± 0.85 years), selected through convenience sampling and randomly assigned to three groups: the gender ST group (n = 40), the questioning group (n = 40), and the control group (n = 40). For all groups, baseline performance (i.e., SLJ) was measured by a female researcher following a warm-up period. In the experimental phase, the control group repeated the baseline conditions; the gender ST group completed the same test but was evaluated by a male examiner (i.e., implicit stereotype induction), while participants in the questioning group were assessed after receiving questioning statements while performing the task in front of a male examiner. RESULTS: The results of the present study showed that the induction of a gender ST leads to a decrease in SLJ in girls. Additionally, if these inducing conditions of gender ST are accompanied by a questioning condition, the negative effects of gender ST can be reduced, and SLJ in girls does not decline. CONCLUSION: Based on our findings, this intervention is recommended as a simple, inexpensive, and quick solution for mitigating the negative effects of gender ST on girl's motor performance.",

      "abstract": "Background: The surgical treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is influenced by factors such as skeletal maturity, curve magnitude, progression, and spinal flexibility. The assessment of spinal flexibility is crucial for surgical planning; supine bending radiographs are commonly used but there is no consensus on the optimal technique. Fulcrum bending radiographs (FBRs) have shown better prediction of post-surgery correction compared to supine bending radiographs. New radiological techniques allow a significant reduction in radiation exposure. This study aims to compare spinal flexibility assessment and radiation exposure between FBRs and standing side-bending radiographs (SSRs) using biplanar stereoradiography. Materials and Methods: Twenty-five consecutive AIS patients scheduled for surgery were included in this prospective cohort study. Exclusion criteria were non-idiopathic etiology, age younger than 12 years, and older than 18 years. Pre-surgery FBRs and SSRs were performed, and the Cobb angles were measured. Flexibility and correction rates were calculated. Dose-area products (DAPs) were recorded. Statistical analysis was conducted using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Spearman correlation. Results: The mean pre-surgery Cobb angle of the thoracic curve was 66.3°. The FBR was superior to SSR for assessing flexibility for thoracic curves and provided a better prediction for post-surgery correction. There was no significant difference in lumbar curves between FBR and SSR. The mean DAP for SSRs was 0.81 Gy*cm2 compared to 3.42 Gy*cm2 for FBR, indicating a lower radiation exposure using SSRs. Conclusions: FBRs are superior for flexibility assessment of thoracic curves in AIS and offers a better prediction of post-surgery correction compared to SSRs. However, FBR is associated with a higher radiation exposure."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Interventions to improve the standing reach ability of older adults are essential for full functional independence, and structured positive feedback (PF) may be an effective intervention strategy. The purposes of this pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) are to investigate the preliminary efficacy of structured PF for improving the standing reach ability of older patients admitted to a convalescent rehabilitation ward and evaluate the feasibility of a future full-scale RCT. METHODS: Thirty-two eligible older adults (83.3 ± 5.9 years, 23 women) out of 587 potential participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to structured PF (experimental) and conventional rehabilitation (control) groups. Only the experimental group received PF intervention for standing reach ability once every 3 days. Both groups engaged in conventional rehabilitation programs for 2-3 h every day. The primary outcome was change in Functional Reach Test (FRT) performance after 5 weeks of the indicated intervention compared to baseline. Secondary outcomes were change in Short Falls Efficacy Scale International (Short FES-I), a self-reported measure of fear of falling, and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores after the 5-week intervention. RESULTS: The estimated difference in mean FRT change (∆) between experimental and control groups was - 4.1 cm (P = 0.07) according to a linear mixed model, supporting the potential efficacy of PF for improving standing reach ability. Further, Hedge's g value was 0.71, consistent with a moderate effect size. However, the estimated mean change in Short FES-I between groups also indicated greater fear of falling in the experimental group (∆ = - 4.5, P = 0.009, g = 1.0). In contrast, the intervention effect on FIM was negligible (∆ = 2.0, P = 0.66, g = - 0.1). CONCLUSIONS: These results support the preliminary effectiveness of structured PF for improving the standing reach ability of older adults. A larger-sample RCT is warranted for validation and optimization of the structured PF protocol.

      "abstract": "Platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome (POS) is characterized by dyspnea due to a marked fall in blood oxygen saturation while assuming standing or sitting positions. It is a rare condition with an unknown prevalence. The triggering role may remain unclear in a considerable number of patients. We present an 85-year-old female admitted to the emergency department (ED) due to aphasia, deviation of the right lip commissure, tachycardia, and dyspnea. History included a right femur shaft fracture in the previous month, and she was enrolled in a rehabilitation program. She already had a history of multiple falls and cerebrovascular disease. On physical examination, she was apyretic, normocardic, and normotensive, although tachypneic. Peripheral oxygen saturation was considerably different, being higher with the patient in the supine position when compared to a bed elevation of 30º. Lung fields were clear to auscultation, and cardiac examination showed no regurgitant heart murmurs or precordial impulses. No peripheral limb edema was noted. The neurologic examination was unremarkable. Her first arterial blood sample revealed hypoxemic respiratory failure. The remaining complementary diagnostic exams (CDE) were normal, apart from some old rib and spine fractures visible on a CT scan. The patient was admitted to the internal medicine ward for further investigation. After a long march of CDE, a transesophageal echocardiogram revealed the cause of POS, a patent foramen ovale. A contrast test with agitated saline showed a significant passage of bubbles from the right atrium to the left during the Valsalva maneuver, confirming intracardiac right-left shunt, and also an aneurysmal dilatation and lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum. Percutaneous closure is the surgical treatment procedure used. The intervention was discussed with the Department of Cardiology and a conservative approach was decided.  In recent years, increasing articles and case reports of POS have elicited the attention of physicians, who have acquired a greater awareness and have become more accurate in diagnosing and treating patients with unexplained or paroxysmal dyspnea. The challenge is to understand which are the higher-risk patients in order to refer them for primary percutaneous closure."

      "abstract": "Kneeling and half-kneeling training are common positions used in physical therapy. however, research on lower extremity muscle activity is lacking compared to the ergonomic aspects and trunk muscle activity. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects on lower extremity muscle activity during squats in kneeling and half-kneeling positions. The study was designed as a cross-sectional study with a single group of healthy adults. Participants were instructed to perform squats while assuming 3 positions (standing, kneeling, and half-kneeling). Surface electromyography data were recorded 3 times from the rectus femoris (RF), gluteus maximus (GMax), gluteus medius (GMed), and biceps femoris (BF) on the participant's dominant side, and the mean values were analyzed. The participants performed squats for 9 seconds, with 4 seconds of the descent phase, 1 second of the maintenance phase, and 4 seconds of the ascent phase. A metronome was used to ensure precise timing. The study included 30 participants (19 males and 11 females). The muscle activities of the RF, GMed, and BF showed statistically significant differences among the 3 positions, being highest in the half-kneeling position (HKP), followed by the standing position (SP) and kneeling position (KP). The muscle activity of the GMax was significantly higher in the HKP than in the SP and KP (P < .05). The co-contraction ratio was significantly higher with KP than with the SP and HKP (P < .05). In the SP and KP, there were statistically significant differences between the ascent and descent phases of the RF, GMax, GMed, and BF (P < .05). In the HKP, there were statistically significant differences between the ascent and descent phases of the RF, GMax, and GMed (P < .05). The results of this study indicate that squats in the HKP (especially during the ascent phase) require the highest muscle activity, whereas squats in the KP (especially during the descent phase) can be performed with the lowest muscle activity. It can be concluded that these findings could serve as selective indicators for squat exercises and in enhancing postural control, muscle strength, and lower extremity stabilization.",

      "abstract": "Melanoma is one of the most significant and dangerous superficial skin tumors with a high fatality rate, thanks to its high invasion rate, drug resistance and frequent metastasis properties. Unfortunately, researchers for decades have demonstrated that the outcome of using conventional therapies like chemotherapy and immunotherapy with normal drug delivery routes, such as an oral route to treat melanoma was not satisfactory. The severe adverse effects, slow drug delivery efficiency and low drug accumulation at targeted malignancy sites all lead to poor anti-cancer efficacy and terrible treatment experience. As a novel transdermal drug delivery system, microneedles (MNs) have emerged as an effective solution to help improve the low cure rate of melanoma. The excellent characteristics of MNs make it easy to penetrate the stratum corneum (SC) and then locally deliver the drug towards the lesion without drug leakage to mitigate the occurrence of side effects and increase the drug accumulation. Therefore, loading chemotherapeutic drugs or immunotherapy drugs in MNs can address the problems mentioned above, and MNs play a crucial role in improving the curative effect of conventional treatment methods. Notably, novel tumor therapies like photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) have shown good application prospects in the treatment of melanoma, and MNs provide a valid platform for the combination of conventional therapies and novel therapies by encompassing different therapeutic materials in the matrix of MNs. The synergistic effect of multiple therapies can enhance the therapeutic efficacy compared to single therapies, showing great potential in melanoma treatment. Dissolving MNs have been the most commonly used microneedles in the treatment of melanoma in recent years, mainly because of their simple fabrication procedure and enough drug loading. So, considering the increasing use of dissolving MNs, this review collects research studies published in the last four years (2020-2024) that have rarely been included in other reviews to update the progress of applications of dissolving MNs in anti-melanoma treatment, especially in synergistic therapies. This review also presents current design and fabrication methods of dissolving MNs; the limitations of microneedle technology in the treatment of melanoma are comprehensively discussed. This review can provide valuable guidance for their future development.",

Here, we report a 43-year old, female breast cancer who developed severe refractory PRP, which greatly impacted her quality of life. The patient experienced a marked improvement after treatment with tildrakizumab. Treatment was stopped after one year, and the three-year follow-up did not show relapse. In conclusion, 52- week treatment with tildrakizumab, an IL-23 antagonist, proved to be a favourable treatment option for PRP, leading to good patient adherence, improvement in quality of life, and long-term follow-up without relapse."

Task-specific visual feedback balance training (VFBT) has previously been shown to improve upright balance. In addition, therapies using functional electrical stimulation (FES) have been shown to improve various motor functions. Combining VFBT with FES therapy (FES+VFBT) may synergistically improve balance control for those with iSCI. Here we developed the FES+VFBT system that delivered physiologically relevant electrical stimulations to soleus (SOL) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles during VFBT. Ten young able-bodied individuals participated. Kinematic, kinetic, SOL and TA electromyography (EMG) data during quiet standing and limits-of-stability test were used to design the controller for the FES+VFBT system. To evaluate the performance of the designed controller, the controller outputs, which represented stimulation intensities, were compared with the recorded SOL and TA EMG during the four tasks associated with VFBT (i.e., bullseye, hunting, colour-matching, and ellipse tasks). Except for the bullseye task, the designed controller outputs were highly correlated with the recorded EMG, suggesting that the controller could generate electrical stimulations in a physiological manner. We expect that the addition of FES therapy to VFBT could contribute to improving standing balance for individuals with iSCI.",

While it primarily affects younger individuals, it can also present in older adults. This article discusses an extraordinary case of a long-standing neurofibroma in the hand. CASE PRESENTATION: A 70-year-old right-handed individual, known to have hypertension and a pacemaker, presented with a mass on the palm of his left hand. This mass was associated with tingling and mild pain, particularly after excessive use of the hand. Recently, he had experienced partial limitations in hand movement due to the mass's pressure. Following a thorough clinical assessment, he underwent surgical excision of the mass under local anesthesia. Histopathological findings confirmed the diagnosis of neurofibroma. The follow-up was generally uneventful, apart from some persistent tingling sensations. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Solitary neurofibromas affecting small nerves are not frequently encountered in clinical practice and usually appear as a slowly progressive mass that may cause pain and tingling. There are no particular radiological approaches that can definitively diagnose this condition; however, histopathological findings have proven effective in confirming the diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Long-term hand neurofibroma is an infrequent disorder that typically lacks prominent symptoms, highlighting the critical need for medical assessment. Surgery is the only effective treatment for hand cases, providing both a definitive diagnosis and the possibility of being performed with regional anesthesia."

Retroperitoneal schwannomas are rare and typically asymptomatic. CASE PRESENTATION: A 36-year-old female presented with a long-standing, asymptomatic right lower abdominal mass. Imaging revealed a retroperitoneal cystic mass displacing adjacent structures. The tumor was surgically excised, and histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of schwannoma. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and remains symptom-free with no signs of recurrence. DISCUSSION: Schwannomas are benign nerve tumors primarily affecting women aged 30 to 50. This case involved an asymptomatic retroperitoneal schwannoma displacing the inferior vena cava without neurological symptoms. Imaging methods like ultrasound and CT are useful but often lack definitive results, and preoperative biopsy is not recommended due to risks of vascular injury. While conservative management may be suitable for asymptomatic cases, complete surgical excision is crucial to prevent recurrence. Although some suggest partial excision, most literature supports curative resection with negative margins, as incomplete removal can lead to a 10-20 % recurrence rate. The patient underwent successful complete resection. CONCLUSION: Retroperitoneal schwannomas are rare tumors that are difficult to diagnose preoperatively. Radiologic findings are usually nondiagnostic. The treatment of choice is complete surgical excision."

Static component of the Berg balance scale was used to measure balance, and PoData Stabiliometeric plate (\"Chinesport, Italy\") to measure plantar pressure. Data was analysed using SPSS version 25. RESULTS: Of the 52 patients, 26(50%) were in group A with mean age 51.97±4.37 years and mean weight 79.48±5.7kg. The remaining 26(50%) patients were in group B with mean age 50.69±4.41 years and mean weight 78.27±4.55kg. The outcome measures were significantly better in group B compared to group A (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Postural and kinesthetic awareness could possibly be a well-grounded rehabilitative strategy that may support and enhance the balance of individuals with chronic stroke. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: The study was registered at the United States National Institutes of Health (ClinicalTrials.gov) with registration number NCT05915195.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) recipients. It is a marker of impaired CRT response mainly mediated by the reduction of effectively captured biventricular paced beats (BiVp). There are no randomized trials comparing strategies to maintain high BiVp percentage. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of rhythm vs rate control strategies in CRT recipients with long-standing persistent AF. METHODS: We performed a randomized trial including CRT recipients with persistent AF resulting in low BiVp%. All patients received amiodarone, the rhythm control group received external electrical cardioversion (EC), and the rate control group received atrioventricular node ablation, if needed. The primary end-point was 12-month BiVp% (NCT). RESULTS: 43 patients were included in the analysis. The mean age was 68.4 (SD: ± 8.3) years and the mean BiVp% 82.4% ± 9.7%. AF lasted 25 ± 19 months. The mean baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left atrium area, and the maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) were: 30 ± 8%, 33 ± 7 cm2, and 14 ± 5 mL/(kg*min), respectively. The EC success rate was 58%. 38% patients remained in sinus rhythm (SR) after 12 months. BiVp% increased similarly in both arms reaching 99% [95% CI 97.3-99.8] and 98% [94.0-99.0], P = 0.14 in rhythm and rate control groups, respectively. LVEF raised significantly only in the rhythm control group (ΔLVEF 4.1 (± 7.3), P = 0,018) which was driven by the patients who maintained SR. No differences in VO2max, QoL, clinical and safety end-points were observed. CONCLUSION: Despite comparable BiVp% in both groups, only restoration of SR led to improved left ventricular ejection fraction in CRT patients with long-standing AF.

New approaches to increase trial efficiency while maintaining rigor would benefit patients, especially in oncology, in which adjuvant trials hold promise for intercepting metastatic disease, but typically require large numbers of patients and many years to complete. We envision a standing platform - an infrastructure to support ongoing identification and trial enrolment of patients with cancer with early molecular evidence of disease (MED) after curative-intent therapy for early-stage cancer, based on the presence of circulating tumour DNA. MED strongly predicts subsequent recurrence, with the vast majority of patients showing radiographic evidence of disease within 18 months. Such a platform would allow efficient testing of many treatments, from small exploratory studies to larger pivotal trials. Trials enrolling patients with MED but without radiographic evidence of disease have the potential to advance drug evaluation because they can be smaller (given high probability of recurrence) and faster (given short time to recurrence) than conventional adjuvant trials. Circulating tumour DNA may also provide a valuable early biomarker of treatment effect, which would allow small signal-finding trials. In this Perspective, we discuss how such a platform could be established.",

Twelve horses underwent two examinations at least seven days apart. Horses were randomly assigned to receive midazolam intravenously (IV) (0.02mg/kg) or a placebo injection of saline (2-2.5mL IV). Five minutes later, detomidine (0.01mg/kg) and butorphanol (0.01mg/kg) were administered IV and horses were placed in standing stocks. A veterinarian blinded to the treatment protocol used a descriptive scoring system to assess degree of ataxia, acceptance of speculum, chewing on the speculum, headshaking, tongue movement, resistance to palpation, and eye appearance as related to the grimace score. During each examination, additional sedation of IV detomidine (0.006mg/kg) and butorphanol (0.006mg/kg) was administered at the discretion of the blinded practitioner to facilitate safe examination. At the second examination horses received the opposite treatment protocol and, following examination, a routine occlusal adjustment. Scores were compared using JMP software with a repeated measures mixed effects model, treatment as a fixed effect and horse and horse/treatment interaction as random effects. Significance was set at P<0.05. There were no significant differences in any of the single or overall sedation scores between treatment groups or within individual horses (P=0.3). Trends towards improvement of some assessed characteristics of sedation, including decreased tongue movement and less resistance to acceptance of speculum were observed. The use of midazolam may prove beneficial for routine oral examination, as well as other standing procedures, with no obvious undesired side effects.",

However, traditional synthesis methods for cg-N predominantly rely on high-pressure techniques or the utilization of nanoconfined effects using highly toxic and sensitive sodium azide as precursor, which substantially restrict its practical application. On the basis of the first-principles simulations, we found that adsorption of potassium on the cg-N surface exhibits superior stabilization compared to sodium. Then, we chose safer potassium azide as precursor for synthesizing cg-N. Through plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition treatment, the free-standing cg-N was successfully synthesized without the need for high-pressure and nanoconfined effects. It demonstrated excellent thermal stability up to 760 K, and then rapid and intense thermal decomposition occurred, exhibiting typical thermal decomposition behaviors of high-energy-density materials. The explosion parameters were also measured using laser-induced plasma spectroscopy. Our work has substantially promoted the practical application of cg-N as HEDMs."

In this study, LignoForce™ lignin, a biobased aromatic polymer commercially isolated from wood, was fractioned into two parts using acetone, and the resulting lignin fractions had distinct thermo-rheological behavior. These two fractionated lignins were combined in various ratios and transformed into nanofibers by electrospinning. Subsequently, electrospun fiber materials were disrupted by agitating the mats in water, and the materials were transformed into ultralight 3D aerogels through lyophilization and post-process controlled heating. Using only this combination of two fractions, the morphology of lignin nanofibers was tailored by heat treatment, resulting in lignin aerogels with high flexibility and significant shape recovery properties. Various microscale structures of lignin fibers impacted the resulting physical properties of the elastic aerogel materials, such as resilience, compressive strength, and electrical conductivity for the corresponding carbonized samples. By exploiting lignin's sensitivity to heat and tailoring the thermal properties of the lignin through fractionation, the work provided an interesting path to form robust lignin-derived functional materials without any toxic chemical additives and significant ability to serve as free-standing electrodes with specific capacitance values better than some graphene-based supercapacitors."

METHODS: Forty infants born before 37 weeks of gestation were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group. The Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) and the Segmental Assessment of Trunk Control (SATCo) were administered before and after the intervention. The experimental group, consisting of twenty preterm infants, participated in a computer-based early intervention involving 45 min of play in standing and walking positions, five times a week for 4 weeks. RESULTS: There were significant between-group differences in the gross motor percentiles of the AIMS (p-value <0.001). In addition, there was a significant difference in all conditions of the SATCo scores (p-value <0.05) compared with baseline score. The change in percentiles of gross motor development was significantly correlated (rs = 0.643; p-value <0.001) with reactive SATCo during walking in infants in the experimental group.

      "abstract": "Physical activity is recommended for the prevention of primary and secondary cardiovascular (CV) disease as it is linked to a number of health benefits, especially CV. However, recent research suggests that high-volume, long-term endurance exercise may hasten rather than slow the coronary atherosclerosis progression. This contentious theory has generated a great discussion and is still a major source of doubt when it comes to the clinical treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD) in athletes. CAD is the primary cause of sudden cardiac death in athletes over 35 years. Thus, recent studies evaluated the prevalence of CAD in athletes and its clinical and prognostic implications. Indeed, many studies have shown a relationship between endurance sports and higher volumes of coronary calcified plaque as determined by computed tomography. However, the precise pathogenetic substrate for the existence of an increased coronary calcification burden among endurance athletes remains unclear. Moreover, the idea that coronary plaques in elite athletes present a benign morphology has been cast into doubt by some recent studies showing potential association with adverse cardiovascular events. This review aims to analyze the association between physical activity and CAD, explaining possible underlying mechanisms of atherosclerotic progression and non-ischemic coronary lesions, focusing primarily on clinical and prognostic implications, multimodal evaluation, and management of CAD in endurance athletes."

One such alternative is \"harm reduction,\" which has generated a wave of positive interest from patients and clinicians alike because of its emphasis on individual autonomy, personal goals and quality of life. While harm reduction can provide an attractive alternative to seemingly endless cycles of ineffective treatment, this narrative review builds on previous work to highlight the inadequate terminology and possible dangers of considering harm reduction as the endpoint of treatment. In conjunction with perspectives from a lived experience author, we consider wider contextual and ethical issues in the field of eating disorders, which should inform the role of harm-reduction approaches in this patient group."

However, the number and identify of plant traits that will respond to this form of selection, as well as the overall predictability of evolutionary responses, remain unclear. We experimentally evolved 20 large replicate populations of Mimulus guttatus for 10 generations under three treatments: pure outcrossing, mixed mating (10% outcrossing) and pure selfing. These populations were founded from the same genetically diverse and outcrossing natural population. After 10 generations, all measured traits evolved with flower size, phenology, and reproductive traits diverging consistently among mating system treatments. Autogamy increased dramatically in the selfing treatment, but the magnitude of adaptation only becomes clear once inbreeding depression is factored out. Selfing treatment plants evolved reduced stigma-anther separation, and also exhibited declines in flower size and per-flower reproductive capacity. Flower size also declined in selfing populations but this was driven mainly by inbreeding depression and cannot be attributed to adaptation towards the selfing syndrome. Generally, the mixed mating populations evolved trait values intermediate to the fully selfing and outcrossing populations. Overall, our experimental treatments reiterated differences that have been documented in interspecific comparisons between selfing and outcrossing species pairs. Given that such contrasts involve species separated by thousands or even millions of generations, it is noteworthy that large evolutionary responses were obtained from genetic variation segregating within a single natural population."

We present the case of a 73-year-old Japanese man with a 13-year history of dopa-responsive Parkinsonism and abnormalities observed in metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy, suggesting Parkinson's disease. However, autopsy results revealed PSP pathology, including tuft-shaped astrocytes and globose-type neurofibrillary tangles, without Lewy body pathology. The degeneration was moderately to severely distributed in the globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and substantia nigra, whereas striatal degeneration was mild. These findings suggest an intact response to L-dopa therapy throughout the patient's lifetime. Pathological examination of cardiac sympathetic nerves revealed intact nerves, suggesting functional involvement in the MIBG abnormality. This study provides further evidence of the clinical and pathological heterogeneity of PSP. Homozygosity for both the rs564309-C allele at TRIM11 and the rs2242367-G allele at SLC2A13 might have played a protective role.

Considering that exercise can be implemented in different positions, the aim of the current study was to compare the effects of training at standing and lying positions on quality of life, and clinical symptoms in women with mild varicose veins. METHODS: Twenty-five women with mild varicose veins aged 35-50 years were randomly assigned to three groups; exercise at standing position (n=10), exercise at lying position (n=8) and control (no treatment) group (n=7). Each exercise program involved 6 weeks of training. Quality of life, pain severity, ankle swelling, and lower leg and ankle circumferences were measured using the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire, Visual Analog Scale (VAS), four-point pitting edema grading scale, and tape measure, respectively at baseline and at the end of the study. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the least significant difference (LSD) as post hoc test. RESULTS: Following a 6-week exercise program, there was a significant improvement in the quality of life of the participants in both exercise groups, and a significant reduction in pain, ankle swelling, and lower leg and ankle circumferences compared to pre-training and control group (P <0.05). However, there was no significant difference between two exercise groups in terms of study variables (P >0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The current study showed that exercise program comprising standing position exercises can significantly reduce the symptoms of mild varicose veins.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lymphopenia and high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio are known negative prognostic factors in rectal cancer. Until recently, however, lymphopenia was regarded as a minor sequela following radiation therapy (RT). The immune system's influence on rectal cancer treatment outcomes led us to evaluate the impact of lymphopenia at various time points, before, during, and following radiotherapy. We hypothesized that chronic lymphopenia following radiotherapy might negatively influence the survival of patients, and pre-treatment lymphopenia may be predictive of poor outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective study involved 110 patients treated for rectal cancer between 2015 and 2019. The oncological outcomes are defined as alive without disease (AWOD), alive with disease (AWD), and death. These outcome probabilities tested against variables of lymphopenia before RT, during RT, and at several post-RT follow-up time points. RESULTS: At the end of the study, 69 patients were AWOD (63 %), 13 were AWD (12 %) and 28 had died (25 %). Treatment results were assessed with according level of lymphocytes measured one year following RT: 35 out of 39 patients (89.7 %) with normal values were AWOD. In 65 patients with sustained lymphopenia, 52 % were AWOD, 18.5 % AWD and 29 % died. A similar difference was found at all time-points up to 2 years following RT (p < 0.004). The results of our study shows that pre-existing lymphopenia (prior to RT) is associated with a 3 times greater chance of death compared to patients with normal lymphocyte levels prior to RT. The PFS significantly affected by lymphopenia at all time-points after RT. An NLR of more than 4 was associated with a 3-time higher risk of recurrence than lower NLR scores (p = 0.0054). CONCLUSION: Our results support the relevance of lymphopenia and NLR in the prognosis of rectal cancer. We believe this is the first study showing a negative correlation between sustained lymphopenia and OS following RT.",

Notwithstanding its importance, little is known whether responsibility attributions and the relation between the victim and a witness (i.e., kinship) have different effects on the intention to intervene in situations of different severity (e.g., moral courage situations). We predict an interaction between the situation's severity and the victims' responsibility for their plight. In less-severe situations, witnesses would be less willing to help when they perceive the victim to be responsible for their plight. However, those who are not seen as responsible would receive more help. For more-severe situations, responsibility is predicted to have no effect. Opposite effects are predicted for the relationship between the helper and the victim. We further predict that perceived costs for helping mediates witnesses' willingness to intervene. Two studies showed that people are more willing to help individuals who are perceived as being innocent, but only in less-severe situations. In more-severe situations, people's willingness to intervene increases, regardless of responsibility attributions. We did not observe effects for kinship. Moreover, we provide partial evidence that witnesses of more-severe situations indeed accept higher costs for intervention.",

Frequently, general anesthesia is required to retrieve and ligate the bleeding vasculature when standing wound packing and retrieval of the spermatic cord are unsuccessful. We propose standing laparoscopic ligation of the testicular arteries via the paralumbar fossa as a rapid, effective means of halting hemorrhage while avoiding castration site trauma as well as the cardiovascular and recovery risks of general anesthesia. METHODS: Two geldings, 6 and 9 months old, presented for emergency treatment of severe post-castration hemorrhage of 10 and 24 h durations, respectively. Both geldings underwent standing laparoscopy under light sedation and the testicular vessels were ligated using a bipolar vessel-sealing device. RESULTS: Testicular vessel sealing was successfully performed in both geldings by standing laparoscopy and resulted in immediate cessation of hemorrhage. In one case, a left paralumbar fossa approach allowed coagulation of both the left and right spermatic vessels. The procedure time was 25 and 35 min. No complications occurred, and both geldings recovered uneventfully. CONCLUSIONS: Standing, laparoscopic ligation of the testicular arteries is a feasible emergency treatment in young geldings and can be applied in cases of uncontrolled post-castration hemorrhage."

However, evaluations to date have involved in-person researcher contact. We investigated the feasibility and acceptability of remote delivery to women (n = 12) in Iceland who had experienced trauma on average two decades earlier. METHOD: Participants monitored intrusive memories in a daily diary for one week (i.e., baseline phase), completed (at least) two guided, remote intervention sessions (e.g., via secure video platform), and were encouraged to continue to use the intervention self-guided. RESULTS: Eight participants completed the primary outcome and reported fewer intrusive memories in Week 5 (M = 6.98, SD = 5.73) compared to baseline (M = 25.98, SD = 29.39) - a 68% reduction. Intrusions decreased at each subsequent time point; at 3-months (n = 7) there was a 91% reduction compared to baseline. Other psychological symptoms reduced and functioning improved. Importantly, participant ratings and qualitative feedback support feasibility and acceptability. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest the feasibility of remote delivery of the brief imagery-competing task intervention by non-specialists (who were not mental health professionals) and hold promise for developing psychotherapeutic innovations supporting women with intrusive memories even decades after trauma."

      "abstract": "Neonatal varicella is indeed a rare condition, and most infants born to mothers with varicella have a good prognosis. However, in exceptional cases, neonatal varicella can be life-threatening, particularly for preterm infants. Therefore, it is vital to make an early diagnosis or predict the risk of neonatal varicella to ensure prompt treatment and improve prognosis. This report made an effort to early predict neonatal vericalla by using metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in a preterm infant who was at risk for vericalla infection. A preterm infant born from a mother with varicella with symptom onset at 8 days before delivery, putting the infant at risk for varicella infection. Importantly, the patient develop pneumonia and pneumothorax, and neonatal vericella was suspected. Fortunately, the use of mNGS for testing the varicella gene in the serum promptly ruled out varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection in the patient, as indicated by a negative mNGS result. Subsequent follow-up, which included a 14-day stay in the hospital followed by an additional 7 days at home, confirmed this finding. Throughout this period, the patient did not exhibit any rash or other symptoms associated with varicella. Therefore, the novel approach of using mNGS allows neonatologists to predict and promptly address potential neonatal infections. This early detection is crucial, as delayed diagnosis or treatment could pose life-threatening risks, as exemplified by the case of neonatal varicella. In such cases, neonatologists can take proactive measures instead of standing by for at-risk neonates. Furthermore, given the severity of neonatal varicella as a life-threatening condition, the early exclusion of subsequent varicella infection by mNGS can offer reassurance to both family members and healthcare professionals."

This case report highlights such an instance in a 29-year-old male patient, emphasizing the importance of vigilance among clinicians for detecting canceration in SRUS patients. CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient presented with recurrent constipation and anal discomfort, initially diagnosed with SRUS based on colonoscopy and pathological examination. Despite long-term mesalazine treatment, symptoms persisted, and subsequent evaluation revealed the development of mucinous adenocarcinoma within a short period. Surgical resection, combined with adjuvant FOLFOX chemotherapy, effectively controlled cancer progression. Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive expression of MLH1(+), MSH2(+), MSH6(+), PMS2(+), and HER2(+), providing molecular insights into SRUS-associated mucinous adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: This case underscores the need for increased awareness among clinicians regarding the potential for cancerous transformation in SRUS patients. Early detection and intervention are crucial for improving outcomes in SRUS-associated malignancies. Furthermore, this case adds to existing literature by presenting a rare instance of SRUS progressing rapidly to mucinous adenocarcinoma, highlighting the significance of regular monitoring and timely intervention in such cases. Further research is warranted to elucidate underlying mechanisms and risk factors, guiding future clinical practice and treatment strategies."

The use of laser (Nd:Yag or diode) has been reported but requires specialised equipment. Transcorneal aspiration has not been previously evaluated in the standing horse. OBJECTIVES: To review outcomes of standing transcorneal aspiration of primary iris cysts (STAPIC) in horses. METHODS: Horses were identified from electronic patient records from 2018 to 2024 across four collaborating centres. Clinical presentation and outcomes were identified and reported using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Eighteen horses were identified. Behavioural signs reported included 'spooking' and changes in rideability often associated with jumping. Single large unilateral cysts were present in 11 horses, bilateral cysts in three horses and multiple unilateral cysts in four horses. Following treatment, one horse developed uveitis and fibrin in the anterior chamber associated with needle contact with the iris stroma due to movement, and a second horse developed fibrin within the anterior chamber. Both conditions resolved with anti-inflammatory medication and administration of tissue plasminogen activator. No other adverse effects were reported. Follow-up was available from all horses (median: 6 months, interquartile range [IQR]: 4-11 months) with no recurrence, although one horse developed an iris cyst in the contralateral eye after 3 years. All owners reported improvement in clinical signs, with 61% reporting no further signs. CONCLUSIONS: STAPIC is an effective and easily accessible alternative for treating iris cysts in horses rarely associated with complications.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Bibliometric and scientometric analyses provide a structured approach to large amounts of data, enabling the prediction of research theme trends over time, the detection of shifts in the boundaries of disciplines, and the identification of the most productive countries, institutions and scholars. In the context of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted radiotheranostics, no bibliometric or scientometric analysis has been published thus far. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify key contributors to the literature, assess the global scientific production of related research, and possibly predict future development patterns. METHODS: Scientometrics and bibliometrics were utilized to analyze the current body of knowledge while tracking its evolution to support scientific decision-making comprehensively and systematically. Science mapping techniques were employed to visualize research activities. Two different tools, Tableau and VOSviewer, were utilized, with VOSviewer being deemed the most suitable for the research objectives. The Web of Science (WoS) was used as the principal database for the searches. RESULTS: Through the search process over a period of 30 years (January 1993-January 2023), 694 original studies in the English language were subjected to comprehensive analysis. By employing bibliometric and scientometric methods, multiple networks were created that mapped various concepts, such as publication trends, leading countries, cocitations, coauthorship among researchers and scientists, as well as coauthorship among organizations and funding agencies. This study revealed the evolutionary patterns, trends, outliers, and key players in the PSMA field, which enabled a more nuanced understanding of the research landscape. CONCLUSION: This research contributes to the enrichment of knowledge on PSMA-targeted radiotheranostics through detailed global bibliometric and scientometric analyses. It stresses the necessity for the development of communication platforms, the establishment of supportive infrastructures, and the implementation of proactive solutions to address emerging challenges. This study offers a significant resource for delineating effective strategies and identifying prominent funding bodies essential for continuous advancements in the field of PSMA-based diagnosis and therapy for prostate cancer. It is vital to sustain this momentum to ensure further progress in this pioneering area."

The aim was to investigate the associations of hepatic glucose uptake (HGU) and endogenous glucose production (EGP) to sedentary behavior (SB), physical activity (PA), cardiorespiratory fitness, dietary factors, and metabolic risk markers. METHODS: Forty-four adults with metabolic syndrome (mean age 58 [SD 7] years, BMI ranging from 25-40kg/; 25 females) were included. HGU was measured by positron emission tomography during the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. EGP was calculated by subtracting the glucose infusion rate during clamp from the glucose rate of disappearance. SB and PA were measured with hip-worn accelerometers (26 [SD3] days). Fitness was assessed by maximal bicycle ergometry with respiratory gas measurements and dietary intake of nutrients by 4-day food diaries. RESULTS: HGU was not associated with fitness or any of the SB or PA measures. When adjusted for sex, age, and body fat-%, HGU was associated with whole-body insulin sensitivity (β=0.58), water-insoluble dietary fiber (β=0.29), energy percent (E%) of carbohydrates (β=-0.32), saccharose (β=-0.32), mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids (β=0.35, β=0.41, respectively). EGP was associated with whole-body insulin sensitivity (β=-0.53), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [β=-0.31], and when further adjusted for accelerometry wear time, EGP was associated with standing [β=-0.43]. (p-value for all< 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Standing more, consuming a diet rich in fiber and unsaturated fatty acids, and a lower intake of carbohydrates, especially sugar, associate beneficially with hepatic insulin sensitivity. Habitual SB, PA, or fitness may not be the primary modulators of HGU and EGP. However, these associations need to be confirmed with intervention studies.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Attentional focus is a phenomenon in which shifting the focus of attention alters performance of standing postural control. It can be categorized as internal focus (IF), which directs attention to the body parts, or external focus (EF), which directs attention to the external environment. Although attentional focus that improves standing postural control in younger people exhibits individual dominance, the dominance of attentional focus in standing postural control in older adults remains ambiguous. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the dominance of attentional focus in standing postural control between healthy younger and older adults, a crucial step for understanding the aging process. METHODS: The participants performed a standing postural control task under the IF and EF conditions. Based on the condition during which they exhibited superior performance, the participants were divided into two groups: IF-dominant and EF-dominant. The standing postural control performance in each group under the IF and EF conditions was subsequently compared. RESULTS: The results showed that the participants, encompassing both younger and older adults, were divided into the IF-dominant and EF-dominant groups, confirming the dominance of attentional focus. The performance under the EF condition in older adults was also influenced by the dominance of attentional focus. CONCLUSION: These results highlight the potential importance of intervention methods based on the dominance of attentional focus, providing valuable insights into future research and clinical practice."

      "abstract": "The optimal immunosuppressive therapy for elderly patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate clinical practice and prognosis in elderly patients with UC through comparing between those with elderly-onset UC (EOUC) and those with long-standing elderly UC (LEUC). In this retrospective single-center cohort study, we evaluated elderly patients with UC aged ≥ 60 in August 2022 through collecting medical record data from the time of diagnosis of UC until August 2022. The patients were divided into two groups based on age at disease onset: EOUC (age at onset, ≥ 60 years) and LEUC (age at onset, < 60 years). We assessed the cumulative rates of systemic steroid and molecular targeted drug (MTD) initiation, and colectomy. We enrolled 97 eligible patients (EOUC group, n = 30; LEUC group, n = 67). The cumulative rates of initiating systemic steroid (46% vs. 22% at 1 year, respectively; P = 0.002) and MTD (17% vs. 5% at 1 year, respectively; P = 0.002) were higher in the EOUC group than in the LEUC group. In multivariate analysis, elderly onset was significantly associated with systemic steroid (hazard ratio [HR] 2.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.43-5.29; P = 0.003) and MTD (HR 2.76, 95% CI 1.30-5.87; P = 0.008) initiation. Cumulative colectomy rates did not differ significantly between the two groups. Patients with EOUC were initiated on systemic steroids and MTDs sooner following disease onset than patients with LEUC. Our findings suggest rapid progression and refractoriness in patients with EOUC.",
