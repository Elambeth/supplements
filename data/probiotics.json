      "abstract": "This study evaluates the efficacy of SYNLAC Prime probiotics, both live and heat-killed, in alleviating growth retardation and enhancing the health of white shrimp, Penaeus vannamei infected with Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP). Probiotic supplementation significantly improved growth performance of EHP-infected shrimp by increasing digestive enzyme activity in the hepatopancreas and guts. Interestingly, the final weight and weight gain percentage of EHP-infected shrimp supplemented with live probiotics surpassed that of healthy control shrimp. Probiotics modulated the gut microbiota, notably reducing Vibrio abundance. The immunomodulatory effects of probiotics were further highlighted by increased expression of immune-related genes and enhanced immune parameters. These immune responses are critical for pathogen defense and may contribute to the observed reduction in EHP load and increased resistance to Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection. To elucidate the metabolic differences between healthy and EHP-infected shrimp and to assess the effects of dietary probiotic supplementation, hepatopancreatic metabolite profiles were analyzed using LC-MS/MS. In positive ion mode, 54, 76, and 84 differential metabolites were identified in the NCON, P5D, and P5L groups, respectively, relative to the PCON group. In negative ion mode, 89, 80, and 64 metabolites were significantly altered across the same comparisons. KEGG pathway enrichment indicated that differential metabolites were primarily involved in key metabolic pathways, including terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, one-carbon metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pyrimidine metabolism, and amino acid biosynthesis. Notably, probiotic supplementation modulated multiple metabolic pathways associated with host immunity and energy metabolism. Heatmap analyses further revealed distinct metabolite expression patterns across all experimental groups. Overall, the findings demonstrate that probiotics, particularly live strains, offer a promising intervention for mitigating EHP-induced growth impairment and disease, enhancing both immune responses and metabolic stability in shrimp. This highlights the potential of probiotics as an effective tool in shrimp aquaculture, not only to improve growth performance but also to manage infections and improve overall health."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Pathogenesis of systemic scleroderma is a complex subject. Previous research has emphasized a possible contribution of the intestinal microbiome in developing symptoms. The use of probiotic formulas brings benefit in treatment of various autoimmune diseases, but the evidence for scleroderma is still not exhaustive. No official recommendations have been formulated on this topic, nor has the existing evidence been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the efficacy of probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics in patients with scleroderma with a focus on the improvement of symptoms and change in the quality of life (QoL) both measured using validated scales, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) eradication, as well as change in the intensity of interstitial lung disease and occurrence of pulmonary hypertension. METHODS: We performed a systematic search for randomised trials that assessed the beneficial and harmful effects of pro-, syn-, and prebiotics in patients with scleroderma. Pairs of authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias (RoB) of the included studies. We examined the certainty of evidence in accordance with the GRADE approach. RESULTS: We screened 1,801 references (after the removal of duplicates), and assessed 16 citations in full text. We identified four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 103 participants in intervention and 87 in control groups. The evidence suggests that probiotic intake may not affect gastrointestinal symptoms measured with Visual Analogue Scale for Gastrointestinal Tract (VAS-GIT) (change in the VAS-GIT: MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.40, low certainty, n=56 probiotic group, n=57 placebo group) and the evidence is very uncertain about the effect on gastrointestinal symptoms measured with The University of California Los Angeles Scleroderma Clinical Trial Consortium GIT 2.0 instrument (UCLA GIT 2.0) (change in the UCLA GIT 2.0 - total score: MD -0.18 95% CI -0.44, 0.07, very low certainty, n=76 probiotic group, n=74 placebo group). Meta-analysis showed that probiotic intake may slightly improve the social functioning measured with UCLA GIT 2.0 compared to placebo (MD -0.21, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.10, low certainty, n=57 probiotic group, n=53 placebo group), yet may result in little to no difference in physical functioning measured with HAQ-DI (MD 0.08, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.32, low certainty, n=56 probiotic group, n=57 placebo group) and frequency of adverse events, change in QoL and SIBO eradication. We did not find any studies addressing the effect of pro-, pre-, synbiotics on interstitial lung disease or pulmonary hypertension. The certainty of evidence was low to very low mainly due to high RoB (lack of blinding, incomplete reporting) and imprecision. CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to definitively prove a positive or negative effect of probiotic intake in patients with systemic sclerosis. The results should be interpreted with caution due to low or very low certainty of evidence and would need more confirmation from strain and dose specific RCTs at a lower RoB."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Probiotics are live microorganisms that provide many benefits to the human body when supplemented with a diet. In Saudi Arabia, there are limited studies on the use of probiotic supplements for some gastrointestinal inflammatory and infectious conditions. Many health professionals who provide health care for patients with gastrointestinal conditions may recommend probiotics at different degrees based on their knowledge and experience. This study aimed to explore the knowledge and practice of gastroenterologists and pharmacists in Saudi Arabia regarding probiotics. METHODS: We measured the practice of recommending, prescribing, and using probiotics by analyzing the responses of the healthcare specialists (gastroenterologists and pharmacists) using an anonymous online survey. The survey was constructed to explore the knowledge, use, and manner of prescribing probiotics by healthcare practitioners in the Saudi community to discuss health benefits with patients with gastrointestinal conditions. RESULTS: Most gastroenterologists (61.5%) partially disagreed that probiotics could benefit the treatment of digestive symptoms. However, a third of the pharmacists agreed that probiotic products could relieve digestive symptoms. The attitude toward and practice of prescribing probiotics depend on many factors, including professionals' beliefs in the benefits of probiotics, insufficient evidence from previous studies and clinical trials about the beneficial use of probiotics, cost, and manufacturing brands. CONCLUSION: Gastroenterologists' and pharmacists' knowledge of probiotics was up to date as evident by their ability to identify specific digestive disorders for which probiotics may be beneficial, as well as their rejection of the notion that probiotics are universally effective in all gastrointestinal disorders, which is a commonly held belief in the community. The cost of probiotics as supplements to dairy products or as brands alone may also affect the prescription of probiotics by health professionals, as shown in the current study."

      "abstract": "Characterized by elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and disrupted gut flora, ulcerative colitis (UC) affects millions of patients worldwide. Probiotic therapy is commonly utilized in clinical practice to modulate intestinal flora and ameliorate colitis symptoms. Nonetheless, oral probiotics encounter challenges such as limited bioactivity, brief retention time, intricate pathological conditions, and singular efficacy. Here we designed plant-derived 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid (18β-GA) prodrug nanomicelles with ROS and inflammation-resolving capabilities, as well as anti-depressant effects, to protect probiotics and amplify their therapeutic effects in alleviating UC and UC-associated depression-like behaviors. Upon oral administration to UC lesion sites, prodrug nanomicelles can be dissociated by excessive ROS and release 18β-GA to attenuate colonic inflammatory responses and oxidative stress, which in turn provided a favorable microenvironment for LGG to repair intestinal barrier integrity and restore the gut microbiota. The synergistic therapeutic effects of STG nanomicelles and LGG alleviated UC-associated depression-like behavior by suppressing the activation of microglia and reducing neuroinflammation. This study introduces a promising strategy for oral nanomedicine with satisfactory therapeutic outcomes for the treatment of inflammatory diseases by integrating naturally derived small-molecule drugs with probiotics."

      "abstract": "Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) is a condition marked by an increased proliferation of bacteria in the small intestine. This leads to a range of GI symptoms and nutritional issues. This article examines the preventive and therapeutic roles of nutrition, prebiotics, probiotics, and prokinetics in managing SIBO. Finding the prevalence of SIBO in the general population is challenging due to challenges in diagnosis and different diagnostic methods. Nevertheless, SIBO has been linked to several clinical conditions, such as obesity, celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and hepatic cirrhosis. The connection between SIBO and obesity remains controversial and unclear, with contraindicating evidence regarding its prevalence and association with body mass index (BMI). Anatomical changes from surgeries may also contribute to the development of SIBO, and disruptions in the migrating motor complex (MMC) can facilitate intestinal permeability. SIBO can lead to significant malabsorption of nutrients, including carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and iron, resulting in deficiencies and malnourishment. Additionally, increased levels of immunoglobulins observed point toward a possible immune response to bacterial overgrowth. Hence, understanding the prevalence, clinical manifestations, and nutritional impacts of SIBO is crucial for effective prevention and management. This article underscores the potential benefits of nutrition, including prebiotics and probiotics, in modulating gut microbiota and managing SIBO. Furthermore, prokinetics that enhance gastrointestinal motility may offer possible therapeutic advantages in the future. Continued research is necessary to clarify the underlying mechanisms and refine treatment strategies for SIBO."

      "abstract": "Bone marrow is vital for hematopoiesis, producing blood cells essential for oxygen transport, immune defense, and clotting. However, disorders like leukemia, lymphoma, aplastic anemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes can severely disrupt its function, leading to life-threatening complications. Traditional treatments, including chemotherapy and stem cell transplants, have significantly improved patient outcomes but are often associated with severe side effects and limitations, necessitating the exploration of safer, more targeted therapeutic strategies. Nanotechnology has emerged as a promising approach for addressing these challenges, particularly in the delivery of nutraceuticals-bioactive compounds derived from food sources with potential therapeutic benefits. Despite their promise, nutraceuticals often face clinical limitations due to poor bioavailability, instability, and inefficient delivery to target sites. Nanoparticles offer a viable solution by enhancing the stability, absorption, and targeted transport of nutraceuticals to bone marrow while minimizing systemic side effects. This study explores a range of bone marrow disorders, conventional treatment modalities, and the potential of nanoparticles to enhance nutraceutical-based therapies. By improving targeted delivery and therapeutic efficacy, nanoparticles could revolutionize bone marrow disease management, providing patients with more effective and less invasive treatment options. These advancements represent a significant step toward safer and more efficient therapeutic approaches, ultimately improving patient prognosis and overall health.",

      "abstract": "Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a prevalent global health issue, often requiring antibiotic treatment, which contributes to antimicrobial resistance. This narrative review explores the potential of probiotics and plant-based foods as alternative or complementary preventive strategies against UTIs. Fermented foods, such as yogurt, kefir, and kombucha, contain probiotic strains that can modulate the gut and urogenital microbiota, enhancing resistance to uropathogens. Likewise, plant-based foods, including cranberry, garlic, bearberry, juniper, and nettle, possess bioactive compounds with antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and diuretic properties. Laboratory and clinical studies suggest that these natural interventions may reduce the incidence of UTIs by inhibiting pathogen adhesion, modulating immune responses, and promoting urinary tract health. However, despite promising findings, inconsistencies in study methodologies, dosage standardization, and long-term efficacy warrant further investigation. Future research should focus on optimizing probiotic formulations, standardizing plant-based supplement dosages, and assessing potential food-drug interactions to establish evidence-based guidelines for UTI prevention.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The therapeutic or prophylactic efficacy and safety of probiotics are not well established. The objective of this study was to assess the knowledge and practice of probiotic use in children among pediatric providers. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of pediatric providers. A survey was sent to the members of the American Academy of Pediatrics, New York Chapter 1. RESULTS: We received 168 responses. Participants were mostly females (70%) and with MD or equivalent education (93%). About 50% of responders did not select the correct definition of probiotics and confused probiotics with prebiotics and synbiotics. About 97% of practitioners were asked about the merits of probiotics by families, and 60% of respondents had prescribed probiotics in their clinical practice. The most common indication for prescription was for treatment of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. When asked about their recommendation for a family who had already started probiotics, 66% of the providers recommended continuing the probiotics. There was a significant association between the frequency of probiotics prescription and the type of practice (p < 0.05). However, this association disappeared after adjusting for age, gender, education, and years of practice. The more experienced the practitioner, the lower the odds were of prescribing probiotics (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There was inadequate knowledge about probiotics among general pediatric providers. Of the pediatricians asked about probiotics, most recommended continuing them if a family was using probiotics for a specific condition. Studies with a larger nationally representative sample are required for future research.",

Periodontal pathogenic bacteria cause surface hypoxia, and gingival fibroblasts in the inflammatory microenvironment express HIF-1α, promoting hypoxic areas in periodontal pockets. No drug delivery system is available for the hypoxic region of periodontal pockets. We synthesized BI NPs via berberine (BBR) and indocyanine green (ICG) and formed BIP NPs by wrapping BI NPs with polydopamine (PDA), and the BIP NPs were delivered to the hypoxic region of the periodontal pocket by hitchhiking with the anaerobic probiotic Bifidobacterium bifidum (Bif). The BIP NPs released berberin (BBR) under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, which inhibited the sulfur metabolism of Porphyromonas gingivalis via mild photothermal action and BBR-targeted serine acetyltransferase, resulting in a decrease in resistance to oxidative stress, thus exerting a nonantibiotic bacteriostatic effect. This mild photothermal effect facilitated the uptake of BIP NPs bygingival fibroblasts. Moreover, BBR targeted nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) to reduce ferroptosis, and the gingival fibroblast supernatant modulated macrophage polarization through the NF-κB pathway. In the periodontitis rat model, Bif@BIP+NIR treatment carried the drug to deep periodontal pockets, decreasing local gingival ferroptosis and alleviating periodontitis symptoms. To summarize, engineered probiotics target low-oxygen periodontal pockets for drug delivery, P. gingivalis for nonantibiotic bacterial inhibition, and gingival fibroblasts to mitigate ferroptosis, thus alleviating periodontitis to reduce periodontitis."

      "abstract": "Chronic stress is a widespread problem that significantly affects both physical and mental health, leading to numerous complications such as mood disorders, cognitive impairments, gastrointestinal issues, and chronic diseases. The dysregulation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and the gut-brain axis underlies several stress related disorders, leading to systemic inflammation, neuroinflammation, dysbiosis, and impaired gut barrier integrity. This review emphasizes the growing significance of probiotics as a potential treatment strategy for addressing chronic stress. Probiotics are living bacteria that provide health benefits when consumed in sufficient quantities, acting via several processes including restoration of gut microbial composition, augmentation of gut barrier integrity, and synthesis bioactive compounds such as neurotransmitters and short-chain fatty acids. These effects lead to reduced systemic and neuroinflammation, enhanced neuroplasticity, and the regulation of stress responsive pathways, including the HPA axis. Moreover, probiotics enhance parasympathetic nervous system activity by modulating vagus signaling. Current review indicates the promise of probiotics in alleviating chronic stress; nonetheless, substantial gaps exist regarding strain specific benefits, appropriate doses, and long-term safety. It is essential to address these constraints by comprehensive, large scale clinical studies and tailored therapies. This review highlights the significance of probiotics as a natural, non-invasive approach to chronic stress management, providing an innovative solution for the worldwide issue of stress related health problems."

      "abstract": "Precision probiotics have shown great promise as novel therapies but have not been fully realized. One major obstacle is that different strains of the same gut microbiota species can induce markedly variable phenotypic outcomes. Here, we aimed to optimize and validate in a preclinical model, a six-species precision probiotic therapy for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), an autoimmune complication following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. We had identified these six species as associated with protection against GVHD in a prior clinical study. We isolated strains of three of the targeted taxa (B. longum, C. bolteae, and Blautia spp.) from human stem cell transplant patients and characterized their SCFA production in vitro. We observed significant strain-to-strain variability among these gut microbiota taxa in their capacity to produce short-chain fatty acids, a microbiota-derived metabolite shown to be important for mitigating gut GVHD and inflammatory bowel disease, in vitro. We found that B. longum was able to augment butyrate production by C. bolteae and Blautia when co-cultured in vitro. \"Optimized\" precision probiotics mitigated GVHD and significantly increased survival (p = 0.013, log-rank test) in mice compared to a \"standard\" probiotic consortium of the same bacterial species obtained from a commercial repository. Importantly, the optimized probiotics resulted in significant increases in intestinal short-chain fatty acid concentrations compared to standard probiotics (p < 0.001, Mann-Whitney test). Our findings highlight the promising potential of utilizing an optimized precision probiotic approach to maximize therapeutic efficacy."

      "abstract": "The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in regulating health and mitigating diabetes-induced liver injury. This study evaluated the hepatoprotective effects of Bifidobacterium bifidum supplementation, both alone and in combination with metformin, in a rat model of diabetes-induced liver dysfunction. Rats were divided into six groups: control, probiotic only, metformin only, diabetic, diabetic with probiotic supplementation, and diabetic with combined probiotic and metformin treatment. Diabetes was induced using a single streptozotocin (STZ) injection following a 12 h fast. Probiotic supplementation (1 × 109 CFU/kg daily) was initiated 2 weeks before diabetes induction and continued throughout the experiment, while metformin was administered concurrently at a therapeutic dose. Weekly assessments included fasting blood glucose, insulin levels, glycation markers, and liver function tests. Both probiotic and metformin treatments significantly improved glycemic control (p < 0.05) and reduced fasting blood glucose levels (p < 0.01), with the combined therapy demonstrating the most pronounced effects. Additionally, insulin sensitivity was enhanced (p < 0.05), antioxidant enzyme levels were restored (p < 0.01), and histopathological analyses revealed preserved liver architecture, decreased inflammation (p < 0.01), and reduced fibrosis (p < 0.05). The Comet assay confirmed a significant reduction in DNA damage (p < 0.01), indicating the protective effects of the interventions against diabetes-induced hepatic injury. These findings highlight the potential of combining Bifidobacterium bifidum supplementation with metformin as a promising probiotic-based therapeutic approach for managing diabetes-related liver complications. Future studies are warranted to confirm these results and to optimize the long-term efficacy of probiotic interventions in diabetes management."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Halitosis is a term that defines any unpleasant odour smell originating from the oral cavity and may have a local or systemic origin. This project aims to determine the effectiveness of treatment involving antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) combined with treatment using probiotics at reducing halitosis. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 92 individuals from 18 to 60 years of age with a diagnosis of halitosis (sulfide≥112 ppb, gas chromatography) will be selected. The participants will be randomly allocated to four groups (n=23). Group 1 (control): brushing, dental floss and tongue scraper; group 2: brushing, dental floss, tongue scraper and aPDT with blue Light Emitting Diode (LED) +annatto; group 3: brushing, dental floss, tongue scraper and aPDT with blue Light Emitting Diode (LED) +annatto and probiotic lozenges containing Streptococcus salivarius K12 (BLIS K12); and group 4: brushing, dental floss, tongue scraper and probiotic lozenges containing S. salivarius K12 (BLIS K12). Comparisons will be made of the respiratory analysis results before and immediately after the first treatment session, at the end of the 30-day treatment period and again 60 days after the treatment initiation. Microbiological analysis (counts of colony-forming units of viable bacteria from coated tongue) will be performed at the same time. The microbiome analysis will be conducted before treatment, 30 days after treatment completion and 60 days after treatment initiation, following DNA extraction. All groups will receive oral hygiene instructions as well as brushes, toothpaste and dental floss. Data normality will be checked using Shapiro-Wilk test. In the case of normality, analysis of variance is used for the comparisons. In the case of non-parametric data, Kruskal-Wallis test will be used. Wilcoxon test will be used to analyse the results of each treatment between two assessment times.

A huge amount of interdisciplinary medical information for the treatment of HCC has been accumulated over recent years. For example, advances in new immunotherapy have improved the results of treatment for HCC. This approach can be advantageously combined with standard conventional treatments such as surgical resection to improve the therapeutic effect. However, several toxic effects of treatments may pose a significant threat to human health. Now, a shift in mindset is important for achieving superior cancer therapy, where probiotic therapy may be considered, at least within the bounds of safety. The interplay between the gut microbiota and immune system could affect the efficacy of several anticancer treatments, including of immune checkpoint therapy via the alteration of Th17 cell function against various malignant tumors. Here, some recent anticancer techniques are discussed, whereby the growth of HCC may be effectively and safely repressed by probiotic therapy."

The effectiveness of probiotics in reducing inflammatory damage in MS. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was the potential effectiveness of probiotics in reducing Multiple Sclerosis progression in preclinical and clinical studies. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Google Scholar databases were searched using multiple relevant keywords, and screening was carried out based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria from January 2004 to August 16, 2024. RESULTS: Based on our criteria, 269 papers were obtained, and after omission of unsuitable articles, 23 full-text articles consisting of 17 animal studies and six human models were selected. It was concluded that in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal model, probiotics such as Bifidobacterium, Prevotella, and Lactobacillus can decrease the T helper 1 (Th1)/Th17 ratio while inducing interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin (IL)-17 levels. In all cases, probiotics can modulate immune cells and cytokines and consequently decrease EAE signs and symptoms. In all human studies, single or multiple probiotics decreased the severity of disease and changed the gut microbiota population. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that probiotics can control the development of MS by reducing inflammatory conditions, and may have beneficial effects in the prevention and treatment of MS.",

      "abstract": "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major pathogen responsible for acute lung injury (ALI) and other respiratory diseases. Probiotics and their metabolic byproducts are essential regulators of the gut-lung axis. This study investigated the protective effects of a mixed probiotics combination (Ligilactobacillus salivarius H3, Bacillus stratosphericus J1366, and Priestia megaterium J1037), which demonstrated inhibitory activity against MRSA growth and biofilm formation in vitro, on MRSA-induced ALI in mice. Results indicated that MRSA infection exacerbated lung pathological damage (P < 0.001), oxidative stress, and inflammation, while also disrupting gut microbiota balance and impairing intestinal barrier integrity. In contrast, the mixed probiotics restored gut microbiota homeostasis, enhanced barrier function, and increased short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels in the gut and circulatory system, particularly butyrate (P < 0.05). These changes promoted the polarization of macrophages towards the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype (P < 0.05), thereby reducing pulmonary bacterial load (P < 0.05) and alleviating inflammation. 16S rDNA sequencing revealed that mixed probiotics diminished the prevalence of Staphylococcus (P < 0.001) in the gut, while fostering the proliferation of beneficial genera such as Lactobacillus (P < 0.001) and Bifidobacterium (P < 0.05). Notably, while vancomycin treatment reduced lung bacterial load (P < 0.05) and inflammation, it aggravated gut microbiota imbalance and barrier damage. These findings indicate that administering mixed probiotics prevents MRSA-induced ALI by regulating the gut-lung axis, providing a potential alternative to antibiotics in managing bacterial pneumonia."

In total, 720 one-day-old (Ross-308) male broiler chicks were randomly assigned to five distinct feeding regimens (each treatment consisting of six replicates of 24 birds) including: (1) negative control (NC), fed only basal diet; (2) positive control (PC); with C. perfringens challenge + basal diet; (3) CP-Ab: challenged + virginiamycin (Stafac® 500) at 200 g/ton, (4) CP-Pro: challenged + 200 g/ton B. subtilis PB6 (Clostat dry®) probiotic additive, and (5) CP-LS2: challenged and fed an antimicrobial peptide (LassoTide Plus®) at 200 g/ton. The NE challenge was induced by administering 10X coccidia vaccine on day 15 followed by inoculation with a pathogenic field strain of C. perfringens type G (1 × 108 CFU/ml/ bird; 1 ml) on days 19 and 20 through oral gavage. Feeding AMP and probiotic to the NE-affected broilers resulted in 23.93% and 19.70% respectively higher body weight gain and 76.59% and 70.27% lower mortality compared to the PC. Similarly, supplementation with AMP improved (P < 0.05) gut morphology, carcass yield (5.82%), meat water holding capacity (14.73%), and reduced cooking loss (10.01%), dripping loss (20.87%), and shear force (25%) as compared to the PC. Additionally, the excreta score, litter quality and welfare attributes were significantly ameliorated (P < 0.05) with AMP addition. In conclusion, the findings suggest that AMP outperformed both virginiamycin and probiotic, demonstrating its potential as a superior substitute for AGPs in broilers.",

While assisted reproductive technologies (ART) provide hope, recurrent implantation failure (RIF) continues to challenge approximately one in 10 couples undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF). This expert opinion document intends to highlight the promise of probiotics, particularly from Lactobacillus, as a therapeutic approach for improving fertility and treating RIF. In India, on June 29-30, 2024, a physical expert meeting was organized involving 14 specialists from gynecology, obstetrics, and fertility fields. The role of probiotics in reproductive health was discussed in the meeting with an emphasis on infertility and RIF. All experts agree that microbial dysbiosis characterized by an imbalance among the dominant Lactobacillus species is associated with RIF leading to increased inflammation hence poor reproductive outcomes. Probiotics have emerged as possible therapies that restore microbial equilibrium while reducing inflammation and enhancing the intactness of the genital epithelium barrier. All experts have strongly supported the use of Lactobacillus-based oral probiotic supplementation particularly for preventing miscarriages and maintaining pregnancy. All the experts unanimously agreed that oral probiotic supplementation, particularly Lactobacillus-based, should be considered as a potential method to prevent miscarriages and aid in maintaining pregnancy. They recommend oral probiotic use prior to embryo transfer to enhance implantation and pregnancy rates. This expert opinion emphasizes the value of probiotics as a safe and non-invasive approach to treating infertility and RIF. By fostering a balanced microbiome, probiotics may increase the likelihood of successful pregnancies."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Skin wound healing represents a dynamic and intricate biological process involving the coordinated efforts of various cellular and molecular components to restore tissue integrity and functionality. Among the myriads of cellular events orchestrating wound closure, fibroblast migration and the regulation of fibrosis play pivotal roles in determining the outcome of wound healing. In recent years, probiotic therapy has emerged as a promising strategy for modulating wound healing and fibrosis. Here, we aim to investigate the effect of bacterial probiotics on cell migration and anti-fibrotic response of human dermal fibroblast (HDFs). METHODS: Probiotic mixture BioK was co-cultured with HDFs in vitro to assess its impact on fibroblast migration, gene expression, and protein production associated with important processes in wound healing. Gene expression was investigated by transcriptomic analysis and confirmed by RT-qPCR. Protein levels of the identified genes were evaluated by ELISA. The role of lactic acid, produced by BioK, in mediating pH-related effects on fibroblast activity was further examined. RESULTS: We observed that BioK effectively promoted HDFs migration in vitro, which was found to be related to the up-regulation of genes involved in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways such as Paxillin, PI3K, PKC and ITG-β1. Interestingly, we also found that BioK down-regulated the expression of Nox-4, α-SMA and Col-I in TGF-Smad signaling pathways, which are involved in the differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, and extracellular matrix type I collagen production, demonstrating its potential in reducing formation of fibrosis and scars. One of the acting factors for such down-regulation was identified to be BioK-produced lactic acid, which is known to lower the surrounding pH and to play a major role in fibroblast activity and wound healing. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates BioK's beneficial effects on fibroblast migration and its potential to mitigate fibrosis through pH modulation and pathway-specific gene regulation. These findings enhance our understanding of probiotic action on wound healing and offer promising therapeutic insights for the reduction of scar formation. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.",

      "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of antimicrobial resistance has emerged as one of the most pressing animal and public health challenges of our time. Probiotics, extensively employed in human and veterinary medicine, are instrumental in maintaining a balanced microbiome and mitigating its disruption during antibiotic therapy. While their numerous benefits are well documented, probiotics also present potential risks, notably the capacity to harbor antimicrobial resistance genes. This genetic reservoir could contribute to the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance by facilitating the horizontal transfer of resistance genes to pathogenic bacteria within the gut. This review critically examines the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes in commonly used probiotic strains, explores the underlying mechanisms of resistance, and provides a balanced analysis of the benefits and risks associated with their use. By addressing these dual aspects, this paper highlights the need for vigilant evaluation of probiotics to preserve their therapeutic potential while minimizing public health risks."

OBJECTIVE: The current systematic review investigated the effects of probiotics supplementation on short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Medline/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases were searched from inception to February 2024, including only randomized controlled trials. RESULTS: A total of 30 studies were included, involving 1499 participants. The vast majority of trials investigated Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains. These were categorized into healthy adults (n = 6), gastrointestinal/inflammatory diseases (n = 7), metabolic diseases (n = 6), elderly individuals (n = 3), children (n = 4), and infant formula (n = 4). Most studies evaluated isolated strain supplementation (n = 12), followed by fermented beverages (n = 11) and probiotic mixes (n = 3). Globally, 16 studies (53.3%) revealed an increase in at least 1 SCFA in participants supplemented with probiotics. In comparison, 5 studies (16.7%) reported a reduction and 9 studies showed no statistically significant impact in their findings (30%). The subgroup evaluation showed heterogeneity in the results, with low to moderate evidence grading levels. CONCLUSION: Probiotics supplementation during childhood was the intervention period more effective in increasing fecal SCFAs and immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels (GRADE: moderate/high-certainty evidence).

      "abstract": "The interaction between the gut microbiome and cancer chemotherapy has been extensively studied. However, the exact role of the vaginal microbiome in chemotherapy remains unknown. To address this issue, we established a colorectal cancer chemotherapy mouse model. Here, we confirmed that 5-fluorouracil induced dysbiosis in both the vaginal and gut microbiomes, presenting a new challenge for conventional chemotherapy. Therefore, we innovatively propose an \"intestinal-vaginal\" probiotics administration strategy, which involves the simultaneous delivery of probiotics to both the gut and vagina, aiming to enhance chemotherapy efficacy while alleviating dysbiosis and associated side effects. Our results indicate that, compared to gut-only probiotic intervention, \"intestinal-vaginal\" probiotics administration significantly enhanced the anticancer efficacy of 5-fluorouracil by upregulating the p53 pathway. Furthermore, regarding gastrointestinal side effects, \"intestinal-vaginal\" probiotics more effectively reduced the release of vomit-associated neurotransmitters (e.g., 5-HT and SP), while also alleviating mucositis by downregulating the NF-κB pathway. Additionally, \"intestinal-vaginal\" probiotics outperformed the oral probiotic by increasing beneficial microbiota and reducing pathogenic bacteria. Notably, regarding vaginal side effects, \"intestinal-vaginal\" probiotics significantly inhibited the NF-κB inflammatory pathway and pro-apoptotic proteins, and improved vaginal dysbiosis compared to vaginal-only probiotics. These findings provide the first evidence of the significant potential of the \"intestinal-vaginal\" probiotics delivery approach as an adjunctive cancer therapy, which offers a novel perspective on the synergistic interactions between host microbiota communities."

Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota affects skin diseases through the gut-skin axis. Therefore, microbiota-targeted therapy may potentially serve as a new management strategy for cAD. The present study aimed to investigate the association between gut microbiota and cAD and to evaluate the effect of probiotics on the clinical symptoms of cAD and gut microbiota in dogs. RESULTS: Gut microbiota was analyzed at baseline and after 8 and 16 weeks. Baseline analysis revealed significantly lower (p < 0.05) gut microbial diversity in dogs with cAD than in healthy dogs. Differential abundance analysis showed that Fusobacterium, Megamonas, Collinsella, unclassified Clostridiales, Bacillus, Helicobacter, and Caproiciproducens were significantly more abundant in healthy dogs. In contrast, Clostridioides, Erysipelatoclostridium, Clostridium, Terrisporobacter, and unclassified Ruminococcaceae were significantly more abundant in dogs with cAD, In addition, differential abundance analysis showed that the abundance of 46 metabolic pathways were significantly different between healthy dogs and dogs with cAD indicating the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota in cAD. Moreover, the clinical severity of cAD was negatively correlated (p < 0.05) with alpha diversity and the abundance of Fusobacterium and Megamonas. Notably, daily probiotic administration for 16 weeks significantly decreased the clinical severity (p < 0.05). Dogs with good prognoses exhibited significantly increased alpha diversity, whereas those with poor prognoses did not, suggesting that the therapeutic effects of probiotics may be mediated by changes in gut microbial diversity. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the association between gut microbiota dysbiosis and cAD in dogs and demonstrates that probiotic administration can effectively ameliorate cAD by improving gut microbial dysbiosis. These findings provide a basis for novel microbiota-based therapies in cAD treatment.",

However, comprehensive reviews integrating the diverse therapeutic effects of probiotics in human subjects have been limited. By analyzing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses, this review provides a comprehensive overview of key developments in probiotic interventions targeting gut, liver, skin, vaginal, mental, and oral health. Emerging evidence supports the efficacy of specific probiotic strains and combinations in treating a wide range of disorders, from gastrointestinal (GI) and liver diseases to dermatological conditions, bacterial vaginosis, mental disorders, and oral diseases. We discuss the expanding understanding of microbiome-organ connections underlying probiotic mechanisms of action. While many clinical trials demonstrate significant benefits, we acknowledge areas requiring further large-scale studies to establish definitive efficacy and optimal treatment protocols. The review addresses challenges in standardizing probiotic research methodologies and emphasizes the importance of considering individual variations in microbiome composition and host genetics. Additionally, we explore emerging concepts such as the oral-gut-brain axis and future directions, including high-resolution microbiome profiling, host-microbe interaction studies, organoid models, and artificial intelligence applications in probiotic research. Overall, this review offers a comprehensive update on the current state of therapeutic probiotics across multiple domains of human health, providing insights into future directions and the potential for probiotics to revolutionize preventive and therapeutic medicine."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome (NRDS) is a common and severe respiratory disorder in neonates, particularly among preterm infants (PTIs), and is often associated with hypoxemia and multiple organ dysfunction. This study aims to investigate the gut microbiota characteristics in NRDS and the potential regulatory role of probiotics in restoring gut microbiota dysbiosis. METHODS: This study enrolled 55 PTIs diagnosed with NRDS and 26 preterm infants without NRDS. The NRDS group was classified into two groups based on treatment: an antibiotic-only group (TA group, N = 30) and an antibiotic plus probiotics group (TB group, N = 25). Fecal samples were collected within 48 h of birth and again after recovery, for 16S rRNA sequencing. RESULTS: The study revealed that the gut microbiota diversity in the NRDS group was significantly greater than in the non-NRDS group, and the microbiota composition in the NRDS group was closely associated with multiple clinical indicators, including Apgar score, pH, PaO2, and PaCO2. Notably, the abundance of bacteria such as Muribaculaceae Incertae Sedis, Rhodococcus, and Corynebacterium was significantly higher in the NRDS group, which may contribute to disease progression. ROC analysis suggested that gut microbiota could serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosing NRDS. Probiotic intervention notably restored the gut microbiota structure in the NRDS group, particularly by enhancing the abundance of beneficial genera such as Streptococcus, Bifidobacterium, and Clostridium. This intervention reduced the microbiota disparity between the NRDS group and normal one-month-old children, thereby slowing disease progression. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the NRDS displayed an increase in gut microbiota diversity and alterations in specific bacterial populations, both of which were closely correlated with clinical data. Probiotic treatment aids in restoring the disrupted gut microbiota in NRDS infants, promoting disease recovery, and providing new biomarkers and clinical strategies for managing NRDS."

This expert opinion emphasizes the importance of oral probiotic supplementation in managing these conditions. A physical meeting with 14 experts was conducted on June 29-30, 2024, during which they highlighted that probiotics, particularly Lactobacillus species, have beneficial effects on restoring and maintaining healthy vaginal microbiota. Probiotics also promote vaginal health and aid in treating conditions such as bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Probiotics are proven effective in managing bacterial vaginosis by enhancing beneficial bacteria and reducing harmful ones. They help prevent and treat recurrent urinary tract infections by increasing lactobacilli levels, inhibiting Candida growth, and maintaining vaginal pH to prevent vulvovaginal candidiasis. Symptoms of genitourinary syndrome of menopause, such as vaginal dryness, itching, and recurrent urinary tract infections, can be alleviated through a combination of Lactobacillus-based probiotics and estrogen therapy. Experts also recommended probiotic supplementation for women with polycystic ovarian syndrome to improve both chemical and clinical pregnancy rates. Probiotics help modulate gut microbiota; improve blood glucose levels, insulin resistance, cholesterol, and androgen levels; restore the LH/FSH ratio; and enhance reproductive health. This expert opinion underscores the key role of Lactobacillus species in treating and preventing various gynecological disorders such as bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, genitourinary syndrome of menopause, urinary tract infection, and polycystic ovarian syndrome by restoring and maintaining vaginal microbiota, thus supporting overall feminine health."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a serious health problem, and finding new treatments is important. There is growing evidence for the antitumor activity of probiotics. This study investigated the anti-cancer potential of a probiotic mix containing Lactobacillus plantarum, L. brevis, L. helveticus, and L. delbrueckii, alone or in combination with the chemotherapy drug 5-fluorouracil, against CRC. METHODS: The research was carried out in Mashhad in 2021. The cytotoxic effect of Lactobacillus isolates on CRC cells was investigated in two-dimensional and three-dimensional cell culture models. Histological staining and molecular approaches were used to investigate the regulatory mechanism of Lactobacillus isolates on cell migration, inflammation, fibrosis, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and tumor necrosis in the CRC mouse model. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 20 with a significance level of P<0.05. The tests employed included the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, ANOVA, Dunnett's post hoc, and Kruskal-Wallis. RESULTS: Lactobacillus strains effectively suppressed tumor growth in CRC by promoting cell death and inhibiting fibrosis and inflammation. These bacteria regulated apoptosis-related genes such as Bcl-2-associated protein x (P=0.0033), and BCL-2 (P=0.0029), leading to increased tumor necrosis. Treatment with bacterial supernatants reduced tumor size and fibrosis by downregulating collagen type I, alpha 1 (Col1a1) (P=0.024), Col1a2 (P=0.0231), and actin alpha 2 (P=0.0466), and transforming growth factor-beta expression. Additionally, they suppressed inflammation by decreasing tumor necrosis factor-alpha (P=0.0001), interleukin 6, and IL-1β (P=0.0198) levels in tumor tissues. Furthermore, the treatment inhibited CRC cell migration by modulating epithelial cadherin (P=0.0198) and matrix metallopeptidase 2 (P=0.033) expression. CONCLUSION: Findings indicated that co-administration of Lactobacillus isolates with 5-FU could improve the anti-tumor properties of the standard drug, 5-FU, supporting the therapeutic potential of these safe isolated lactic acid bacteria for CRC patients in vivo.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and effects of the use of probiotics in pregnancy, starting in the third trimester, on rectovaginal colonization of group B streptococcus (GBS) in women at low obstetric risk. METHODS: A multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study was conducted in three tertiary hospitals in northern Italy and included low-risk pregnant women. The intervention consisted of oral administration of two capsules of probiotics or placebo from 30 weeks of pregnancy until 37 weeks of pregnancy. The primary outcome was GBS colonization, evaluated with rectovaginal swabs. In a subgroup, selected at random, changes in the vaginal microbiome after treatment administration were evaluated using 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation sequencing and analysis. RESULTS: In total, 267 pregnant women were randomized to receive probiotics (n = 133) or placebo (n = 134). The two groups were similar at baseline. After treatment, no differences were found in the rates of positive rectovaginal swabs (p = 0.24) and antibiotic administration (p = 0.27). Only one case of postpartum fever (>38 °C) was found in the placebo group. Labour and delivery outcomes and neonatal outcomes were similar in both groups. Analysis of the vaginal microbiota showed that the relative abundance of Lactobacillus spp. was not modified significantly by the probiotics, but the relative abundance of Gardnerella spp. decreased significantly (3.6 ± 7.9 vs 5.5 ± 10.2; p = 0.03). Interestingly, the relative abundance of Lactobacillus spp. reduced significantly in women who subsequently presented with partial rupture of membranes (46.9 ± 43.6 vs 77.7 ± 24.9; p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Although the clinical outcomes were unaffected, administration of probiotics led to favourable changes in vaginal microbiota. It remains to be established how this effect could be translated into clinical advantage."

However, their effects on PM2.5-induced toxic reactions have not yet been well studied. Objective: This study aims to investigate the effects of probiotics on lung function and quality of life in participants exposed to PM2.5, as well as to explore the potential mechanisms underlying these effects. Methods: 120 volunteers were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to receive either a placebo or 2.5 × 109 cfu g-1 LGG probiotics once daily for four consecutive weeks, with a follow-up period of 6 months. An analysis of covariance was conducted for data statistics, using PM2.5 exposure and baseline measurements as covariates. Least squares means and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated to explore the effect of PM2.5 exposure on changes in the intestinal microbiota. A mixed linear model analysis was used to construct a model with baseline values and PM2.5 exposure as covariates to analyse the effects of PM2.5 on SF-36, COOP/WONCA charts, and lung function, and the intervention effect of LGG on these parameters. Results: 120 participants were included. Probiotic intervention demonstrated benefits in the Shannon index and β diversity. After the probiotic intervention, the scores of quality-of-life charts increased during the follow-up period. The pulmonary function indicators, including FEV1, FEF50%, and FEF75%, were statistically different from those in the placebo group. Conclusion: Probiotic intervention can reshape the gut microbiota, offering potential benefits for improving the quality of life in participants chronically exposed to PM2.5."

Probiotics and postbiotics have been extensively studied for their potential to prevent and treat digestive diseases. Growing evidence suggests that programmed cell death, especially apoptosis, is a critical mechanism influencing the molecular and biological aspects of digestive diseases, contributing to disease progression. Understanding the mechanisms and signaling pathways by which probiotics and postbiotics regulate apoptosis could reveal new therapeutic targets for treating digestive diseases. This review focuses on the beneficial effects of probiotics and postbiotics in regulating apoptosis across a range of liver diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, liver injury, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. It also explores their effects on gastrointestinal diseases, such as colorectal cancer, colitis, gastrointestinal injury, and infectious diarrhea. Furthermore, some probiotics help balance the gut microbiota, enhance intestinal barrier function, and regulate the immune system, all of which are closely associated with apoptosis. Moreover, emerging technologies, such as encapsulation methods, have been developed to stabilize probiotics, primarily based on experimental findings from rodent and human studies."

      "abstract": "Developing and utilizing effective local antimicrobial agents can help treat periodontitis while minimizing the risks associated with systemic antibiotic use. Recent studies have shown that the mucosal adhesion properties of hydrogels can play a potential role in the treatment of periodontitis. The hydrogel can improve the contact and retention time of drugs in the periodontal pocket. Through the adhesion of mucosa, it interacts with the mucin coating surface of epithelium and teeth to form a specific interface force. The hydrogel exhibits strong mucosal adhesion (adhesion strength: 5-6 N/cm2) and prolonged retention in periodontal pockets (≥6 h), enabling sustained drug release through dynamic sol-gel transitions triggered by pH and reactive oxygen species (ROS). This design overcomes the limitations of poor mechanical stability in conventional formulations. The dynamic balance of oral microbiota plays an important role in maintaining oral health. Probiotics, by colonizing the oral cavity, transform the infected site from an environment rich in inflammatory cytokines to a more benign environment, inhibit harmful pathogenic microorganisms, and contribute to overall health. Microenvironment sensitive hydrogels can perform dynamic sol gel transformation in situ, and can accurately control drug release when exposed to various stimuli (such as temperature change, light, pH change, reactive oxygen species, etc.). Oral probiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs are encapsulated in hydrogels to inhibit the proliferation and adhesion of oral pathogens by planting in the mouth and producing metabolites, effectively preventing and treating oral diseases."

As conventional treatment and the development of antimicrobials for most infections standard treatment is either limited or not possible, alternative treatment options should be explored. Recent research shows that early enteral nutrition and nutritional supplements (such as probiotics and symbiotics) could have a pivotal role in promoting a healthy microbiome and subsequently preventing and improving outcomes for certain pediatric infectious diseases. However, understanding the specific mechanism of action and tailoring nutritional interventions remains a significant challenge. The optimal dose range for different probiotic strains and prebiotics and the most effective combination for each treatment indication needs further investigation and is yet to be defined. Additionally, in the era of personalized medicine, goal- and patient-directed treatment are key to optimizing and improving outcomes and minimizing potential complications and side effects, especially in complex and immunocompromised patients. The main objectives of this narrative review are 1. to explore the relationship and the complex interactions between microbiota and the human immune system; 2. to describe the influence of nutrition on infectious diseases; 3. to evaluate the impact of supplementation with probiotics and symbiotics in the prevention and treatment of the most relevant infections in children; and 4. to identify knowledge gaps and potential research priorities regarding the use of these supplements in pediatric patients.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Probiotic supplementation has been proposed as a preventive measure for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm infants. This umbrella meta-analysis assesses the effects of probiotics, including single-strain and multi-strain formulations, on NEC and related mortality. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and Embase for studies up to August 2024. The AMSTAR2 tool assessed the quality of included studies. Meta-analysis studies were selected based on the PICOS framework, focusing on preterm neonates (< 37-week gestation), probiotic supplementation (single-strain or multi-strain), placebo or standard care comparison, and outcomes of NEC and mortality. Pooled relative risks (RR) and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using random-effects models. RESULTS: Overall, 35 eligible studies were included into the study. Twenty-six and 32 probiotic intervention arms used single- and multi-strain probiotics, respectively. The findings revealed that probiotics decreased NEC significantly (ESRR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.55, p < 0.001, and ESOR: 0.59; 95%CI: 0.48, 0.72, P < 0.001), and mortality rate (ESRR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.68, 0.76, P < 0.001, and ESOR: 0.77; 95%CI: 0.70, 0.84, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The present review suggests that supplementation with probiotics reduced NEC and related mortality. Probiotic supplementation can be recognized as a NEC-preventing approach in preterm and very preterm infants, particularly Multi-strain probiotics.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial aimed to compare the effects of dulaglutide alone versus dulaglutide combined with probiotics on cardiovascular risk factors, pancreatic beta-cell function, and gut microbiota in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: Sixty overweight/obese adults with T2DM (HbA1c 6.5-11%, BMI ≥ 24 kg/m²) were randomized to a control group (dulaglutide 1.5 mg/week + placebo) or an intervention group (dulaglutide 1.5 mg/week + probiotics containing Bifidobacterium longum, 2 × 10⁹ CFU/dose) for 12 weeks. Outcomes included glycemic control (HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose [FPG], 2-hour postprandial glucose [2hPG]), inflammatory markers (TNF-α, CRP), cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure, lipids), gut microbiota, and safety. RESULTS: The intervention group showed greater reductions in HbA1c (- 1.06% vs. -0.35%, P = 0.028), FPG (- 4.16 vs. -3.92 mmol/L, P = 0.010), and inflammatory markers (TNF-α: -43.6% vs. -33.3%, P < 0.001). Pancreatic beta-cell function improved significantly (HOMA-β: +34.7% vs. +23.1%, P = 0.034), with increased beneficial gut microbiota (Lactobacillus: +2.1 × 10⁶ vs. +1.3 × 10⁶ CFU/g, P < 0.001). Hypertension incidence (0% vs. 13.3%, P = 0.038) and dyslipidemia (0% vs. 16.7%, P = 0.020) were lower in the intervention group. Both regimens were well-tolerated, with no severe hypoglycemia or renal/hepatic toxicity. CONCLUSION: Combining dulaglutide with probiotics enhances glycemic control, reduces inflammation, and improves cardiovascular risk factors in T2DM more effectively than dulaglutide alone, likely through gut microbiota modulation. This dual approach offers a promising strategy for T2DM management, though larger long-term trials are needed to confirm cardiovascular benefits."

      "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis is an idiopathic and chronic inflammatory bowel disease, characterized by inflammation of the mucosa of the colon and rectum. Clinical manifestations commonly include abdominal pain, diarrhea (with or without hematochezia), and weight loss. The pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis is multifactorial, involving a combination of genetic predispositions and lifestyle factors. High consumption of processed food, sedentary habits, alcohol intake, and stress are among the lifestyle factors implicated in disease onset and progression. Current treatment strategies focus on managing symptoms and inducing remission, however, the chronic nature of the disease, along with the adverse effects of conventional therapies, often compromises patient's quality of life. Therefore, exploring alternative therapies that can prolong remission and reduce symptom burden is important. Experimental evidence suggests that probiotics may extend remission duration in ulcerative colitis. Moreover, probiotics exhibit efficacy in amelioration clinical symptoms by reducing inflammation markers, preserving, and restoring intestinal epithelial. This review explores the advantages of the administration of probiotics in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, elucidating their mechanism of action."

      "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are often associated with compromised epithelial barriers and dysregulated gut microbiota. In this study, we revealed the synergistic effect that zinc and indole-3-carbinol (I3C) have in restoring the epithelial barrier, and co-localized them on a ZI platform, which was further conjugated to the surface of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN). The ZI@EcN formulation effectively delivered ZI to colon tissues and extended its retention in the intestines due to the colonic colonization effect of EcN, thereby promoting the sustained release of zinc and I3C for optimal synergistic effects on epithelial barrier remodeling. The restored epithelium acts as a protective barrier, preventing the infiltration of toxins and pathogens, which significantly reduces inflammation in colonic tissues. Additionally, EcN enriched the gut microbiome, increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria while reducing that of pathogens, demonstrating its significant efficacy in gut microbiome regulation. In dextran sulfate sodium-induced mouse colitis models, ZI@EcN exhibited substantially improved prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy with favorable safety profiles, highlighting its potential for clinical applications. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This study highlighted the synergistic effects that zinc and indole-3-carbinol, both derived from dietary sources, have on restoring integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier. A platform (ZI@EcN) was also developed for the targeted delivery and sustained release of zinc and indole-3-carbinol, specifically in colonic tissues, for colitis treatment. This platform not only restores the compromised intestinal epithelial barrier but also regulates the dysbiotic gut microbiota, promoting the recovery of a healthy intestinal microenvironment and showing promise in alleviating complex symptoms in a single formulation. Furthermore, the formulation demonstrated potent prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against colitis, with favorable safety profiles, and a strong potential for clinical applications."

Increasing evidence outlines the importance of the intestinal microbiome in atherosclerosis, wherein gut-derived uremic toxins (GDUTs) may be of concern. Plasma levels of the GDUTs trimethylamine n-oxide (TMAO), p-cresyl sulfate, and indoxyl sulfate are associated with accelerated renal function decline and increased cardiovascular risk. Thus, reducing the amount of GDUTs in circulation is expected to benefit patients with atherosclerosis. Because some beneficial bacteria can clear GDUTs in vitro and in vivo, orally administered probiotics targeting the intestinal tract represent a promising way to bring about these changes. Atherosclerosis such, this perspective reviews the potential use of probiotics to treat atherosclerosis, particularly in patients with non-traditional risk factors and/or impaired renal function."

Probiotics offer ways to investigate microbial-based interventions but results have been mixed, with more evidence of beneficial effects in clinically depressed patients. Using a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled design in 88 healthy volunteers, we conduct a comprehensive study into effects of a multispecies probiotic on emotion regulation and mood through questionnaires, emotional processing tests and daily reports. We find clear evidence that probiotics reduce negative mood, starting after two weeks, based on daily monitoring, but few other changes. Our findings reconcile inconsistencies of previous studies, revealing that commonly used pre- versus post-intervention assessments cannot reliably detect probiotic-induced changes in healthy subjects' emotional state. We conclude that probiotics can benefit mental health in the general population and identify traits of individuals who derive greatest benefit, allowing future targeting of at-risk individuals."

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most prevalent cancer worldwide. It is associated with imbalanced gut microbiota. Probiotics can help restore this balance, potentially reducing the risk of CRC. However, the hostile environment and constant changes in the gastrointestinal tract pose significant challenges to the efficient delivery of probiotics to the colon. Traditional delivery methods are often insufficient due to their low viability and lack of targeting. To address these challenges, researchers are increasingly focusing on innovative encapsulation technologies. One such approach is single-cell encapsulation, which involves applying nanocoatings to individual probiotic cells. This technique can improve their resistance to the harsh gastrointestinal environment, enhance mucosal adhesion, and facilitate targeted release, thereby increasing the effectiveness of probiotic delivery. This article reviews the latest developments in probiotic encapsulation methods for targeted CRC treatment, emphasizing the potential benefits of emerging single-cell encapsulation techniques. It also analyzes and compares the advantages and disadvantages of current encapsulation technologies. Furthermore, it elucidates the underlying mechanisms through which probiotics can prevent and treat CRC, evaluates the efficacy and safety of probiotics in CRC treatment and adjuvant therapy, and discusses future directions and potential challenges in the targeted delivery of probiotics for CRC treatment and prevention."

It was needed to simultaneously address the three issues for the effective treatment of colitis, but it was not satisfied. Here, we developed \"three-birds-one-stone\" probiotics, named Se@EcN-C2/A2, for colitis treatment. Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), a clinically approved probiotic, was used to intracellularly synthesize selenium (Se) nanoparticles by biomineralization, giving Se@EcN. Coating glycol chitosan and sodium alginate on the surface of Se@EcN (Se@EcN-C2/A2) endowed probiotics with high resistance to the harsh gastrointestinal tract environment and strong adhesion and targeting ability to the inflamed site of the colon to facilitate the uptake by M1 macrophages. Se@EcN-C2/A2 was metabolized to SeCys2 and MetSeCys to be involved in the synthesis of GPX2 and TXNRD1, which led to reaction oxygen species clearance to inhibit Toll-like receptor and nuclear factor κB signaling pathways to suppress inflammatory response and polarize M1 macrophages to M2 phenotypes by activating PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. In DSS-induced colitis mice, Se@EcN-C2/A2 exerted satisfactory therapeutic and prophylactic effects, including scavenging oxidative stress and regulating macrophage phenotypes to suppress inflammatory response and restore gut barrier functions. Moreover, the living probiotic EcN in the colon effectively regulated microbial dysbiosis by decreasing the abundance of Escherichia-Shigella and increasing the abundance of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium.",

OBJECTIVE: This umbrella meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively assess the effect of pre-, pro-, and synbiotics on AD among children. METHODS: A systematic search was carried out in the PubMed and Scopus databases up to April 2024 to identify relevant meta-analyses. Relative risks (RR) and weighted mean differences (WMD) along with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using a random effects model to evaluate the impacts on both the incidence of AD and its severity, as assessed by the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index. RESULTS: This umbrella meta-analysis included 38 meta-analyses, with 127,150 participants. The analysis suggested that intervention with pre-, pro-, and synbiotics significantly reduced the incidence of AD (RR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.70-0.79), which was confirmed by subgroup analyses. The treatment significantly reduced SCORAD score (WMD = -3.75, 95% CI: -5.08 to -2.42). In subgroup analysis, multi-strain probiotics, Lactobacillus, synbiotics, and pre-, pro-, and synbiotics mixtures were found to significantly decrease the SCORAD score, while, Bifidobacterium and prebiotics alone did not show a significant effect on the SCORAD score. The treatment resulted in a significant decrease in SCORAD score among children with moderate to severe AD, but not in subjects with mild AD. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics and synbiotics could be promising interventions to reduce the risk of developing AD and alleviate its severity in children."

Probiotics, recognized for their antioxidant properties, may provide a beneficial approach to mitigate this oxidative damage. This research aims to explore the efficacy of native probiotics in reducing oxidative stress in kidney tissues, potentially leading to improved protective strategies against the toxicity caused by heavy metals. In this study, forty male NMRI mice were exposed to Nickel to induce oxidative stress, followed by probiotic treatment to evaluate its potential protective effects. The impact of these interventions on the antioxidant system was assessed through Real-Time PCR analysis, which measured gene expression profiles in the kidney tissue of the mice. The study demonstrated that native probiotic strains effectively upregulated the expression of genes related to Nrf2 signaling pathway before exposing to oxidant agents. Despite the suppressive effects of Nickel exposure on these gene expressions, the subsequent administration of probiotics after Nickel resulted in a significant increase and enhancement of expression levels. This research underscores the detrimental effects of Nickel, a heavy metal, on kidney health while exploring the protective properties of probiotics, particularly their anti-oxidative effects. Given the substantial risks linked to heavy metal exposure, the integration of probiotics presents a promising strategy to alleviate oxidative stress, thereby potentially preventing various kidney disorders associated with this condition. The findings advocate for a dual approach of addressing heavy metal toxicity and enhancing kidney resilience through probiotic intervention."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A detailed bibliographic search on four databases (PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane and EMBASE) was conducted with a language restriction. The collected data were assessed according to the predefined eligibility criteria and randomized clinical trials reporting the effects of probiotics on plaque index (PI), bleeding on probing (BOP) and pocket probing depth (PPD) compared to control or placebo groups were selected and analysed. The risk of bias assessment was conducted using SYRCLE's RoB- 2 tool. The GRADEpro tool was used to determine the overall quality of evidence. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies (10 about gingivitis and 14 about periodontitis) were included in the meta-analysis. In the gingivitis studies, lower but non-significant PI and BOP were found in the probiotic group. In periodontitis, lower PI (95%-CI [- 0.54; - 0.15], p = 0.001) were reported in the probiotic group, and this difference was greater in studies with longer follow-up. Lower BOP (95%-CI [- 0.58; - 0.05], p = 0.021) was also reported, but this difference was only significant in studies with a shorter follow-up (95%-CI [- 0.86; - 0.11], p = 0.012). Meta-analysis for PPD showed lower, but non-significant, values (95%-CI [- 0.53; + 0.03], p = 0.077). However, this difference became significant when assessing studies with shorter follow-up (95% CI [- 0.77; - 0.07], p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis provides evidence suggested that probiotics can serve as a beneficial adjunct to periodontal treatment in patients with periodontitis, particularly in improving clinical outcomes such as plaque index and bleeding on probing. The results from gingivitis studies highlight the need for further investigation to better understand the impact of probiotics in the early stages of periodontal disease. These findings emphasize the importance of future research with standardized protocols and longer follow-up periods to confirm and expand on the clinical utility of probiotics in periodontal therapy.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: During the pandemic, overweight and obese adolescents were at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. Indonesia's government has implemented prevention programmes and immunisation; however, the rise in SARS-CoV-2 infections among adolescents is exacerbated by low-quality diet and lifestyle habits. Also, the vaccine programme is not prioritised in this population. To address this, a solution involves providing probiotics and counselling on healthy lifestyle habits to improve diet and immunity. Therefore, we designed a protocol for a randomised controlled trial with a 20-week intervention to investigate the effect of probiotics supplementation and counselling on healthy lifestyle habits, including healthy eating and physical activity, and psychosocial stimulation, on nutritional status and antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 in this group. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This clinical trial aims to investigate the effects of probiotic supplementation on healthy overweight and obese adolescents. The study will involve 440 adolescents aged 12-17 living in Jakarta, Surabaya or Yogyakarta for at least 6 months and have completed at least two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. The intervention group will receive daily probiotic supplementation of three strains, including Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. Lactis (BB-12), Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA-5) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LGG), at the level of 109-1010 colony-forming units for 20 weeks, while the control group will receive a placebo. Both groups will receive weekly counselling on healthy eating habits, physical activity and psychosocial stimulation. The primary outcomes will be changes in the body mass index for age z-score and IgG specific to SARS-CoV-2 titre concentrations between groups. The secondary outcomes will include changes in secretory IgA specific to SARS-CoV-2 titre concentrations, monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, gut microbiota diversity and the score of Healthy Eating Index 2015. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia-Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital (KET 763/UN2.F1/ETIK/PPM.00.02/2022: 1 August 2022). The study results will be disseminated in open-access international journals, scientific meetings and conferences with stakeholders. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: The study has been registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov with identifier number NCT05623007.",

This study examines the effects of probiotics on depression severity, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and cortisol levels in MDD patients. Fifty medication-free MDD patients were randomized to receive probiotics with fluoxetine (n = 25) or placebo with fluoxetine (n = 25) for 8 weeks. Depression severity was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-24), and fasting blood samples were collected at baseline and study conclusion. Forty-four patients completed the trial. The probiotic group showed a significant reduction in depression severity compared with the placebo group (p = 0.001). No significant differences were observed in serum cortisol (p = 0.46) and ACTH levels (p = 0.44). Plasma BDNF levels increased slightly in the probiotic group but were not statistically significant. Probiotic supplementation with fluoxetine significantly reduces depression severity in MDD patients."

      "abstract": "Probiotics play a crucial role in maintaining human health, particularly in intestinal health. However, their application has been hindered by issues related to their stability, survival through the gastrointestinal tract, and effective delivery to target sites. Encapsulating probiotics within liposomes not only protects them from environmental factors such as light, oxygen, and temperature but also shields them from harmful influences like gastric acid and bile. In addition, encapsulation promotes growth, release, and absorption of probiotics in the intestines. This study reviews the characteristics of probiotics and liposomes and their application advantages, and discusses the current state of knowledge of the delivery of probiotics through liposomes. Additionally, the study investigates how the digestive process affects the performance of liposomes and probiotics, focusing on the structural changes that occur in both probiotics and probiotic-loaded liposomes. Finally, the study discusses the challenges and future directions in the field of liposome-delivered probiotics. Liposome delivery of probiotics represents an innovative technology that significantly enhances the stability and bioavailability of probiotics, thereby offering improved protection for individuals' intestinal health. This novel approach creates new possibilities and advantages for probiotics in the realm of intestinal health and is anticipated to receive broader applications in the future."

      "abstract": "Sarcopenia refers to the decline in skeletal muscle mass and function. Due to its increased mortality rate and severe disability, the clinical importance of sarcopenia is becoming increasingly prominent. Although the exact cause of sarcopenia is not fully understood, the gut microbiota (GM) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia, and increasing evidence suggests that gut dysbiosis may be associated with disease development. In the past few decades, the use of probiotics has surged, few studies have explored their impact on sarcopenia prevention and treatment. Lactobacillus probiotics are commonly used for gut health and immune support, but their mechanism in sarcopenia via the gut-muscle axis remains uncertain. This review highlights the treatment challenges, GM's role in sarcopenia, and the potential of Lactobacillus as an adjunct therapy. In addition, we also discuss the possible mechanisms by which Lactobacillus affect muscle function, such as alleviating inflammatory states, clearing excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), improving skeletal muscle metabolism, enhancing intestinal barrier function and modulating the gut microbiota and its metabolites. These mechanisms may collectively contribute to the preservation of muscle mass and function, offering a promising avenue for advancing microbial therapies for sarcopenia."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is critically characterized with metabolic and endocrine dysfunctions, precipitating metabolic syndrome and infertility in reproductive aged women. Adipose tissue dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome, including in PCOS individuals. Probiotics are healthy bacteria in the gut that regulate metabolic health. However, the impact of probiotics on adipose-driven metabolic syndrome has not been reported. The present study therefore hypothesized that probiotics would attenuates metabolic disturbance in experimental PCOS rat model, probably by suppression of TGF-β1. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight-week-old female Wistar rats were randomly allotted into four groups (n=5). Administration of letrozole (1mg/kg p.o) for 21 days induced PCOS, thereafter the animals were treated with 3x109 CFU (p. o) of probiotics for six weeks. RESULTS: Letrozole-induced PCOS rats were characterized with elevated circulating testosterone, and multiple ovarian cysts. In addition, rats with PCOS developed increased body weight, which was also accompanied with insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and increased leptin, and decreased adiponectin and adipose TG, as well as elevated adipose lipase. Inflammatory markers (NF-kB, TNF-α) were elevated, while antioxidant defense (GSH) was depleted in PCOS animals. A significant increase in adipose TGF-β1, caspase-6 and HDAC2 levels was observed in PCOS rats when compared with the control. Immunohistochemical evaluation of adipose tissue also showed severe expression of NLRP3 in PCOS rats and these changes were accompanied by increased level of TGF-β1. However, treatment with probiotics reversed these aberrant systemic and adipose tissue changes in PCOS model. CONCLUSION: The present results suggest the therapeutic benefit of probiotics against metabolic disturbance in PCOS model through suppression of TGF-β1-dependent pathway."

      "abstract": "The use of coral probiotics, i.e. beneficial microorganisms for corals (BMCs), is a novel approach to enhancing coral health under heat stress. While BMCs mitigate coral bleaching and mortality during prolonged heat stress conditions, their effectiveness in mitigating short-term acute heat stress remains understudied. This study investigates the effects of BMCs on two Red Sea hard coral species, Acropora cf. hemprichii and Pocillopora verrucosa, during short-term heat stress. Twelve coral fragments per species were allocated to each treatment across two temperature regimes (26°C and 32°C) for 48 hours, with half receiving BMC inoculation and half serving as controls. Results show BMC supplementation significantly prevented mortality in Acropora cf. hemprichii at 32°C, contrasting with a 100% mortality observed in the control group. Specifically, probiotic-inoculated Acropora cf. hemprichii at 32°C exhibited preserved primary production, a 12-13 fold increase in algal cell densities, 4-5 times higher FV/Fm ratios, and 4-5 and 2-3 times higher chlorophyll a and c2 concentrations, respectively, compared to their untreated conspecifics. All P. verrucosa colonies survived the 32°C exposure without tissue loss or reduced holobiont function in both control and BMC treatments. These findings underscore the rapid effects of BMC inoculation, initiated just 2 hours prior to acute heat stress, in protecting heat-sensitive Acropora cf. hemprichii against mortality and adverse photo-physiological changes, with beneficial effects visible within 2 days. Recognizing the critical timeframe for beneficial effects is paramount for management strategies to address heat-sensitive corals on natural reefs, such as implementing probiotic interventions before anticipated marine heatwaves."

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Cystic fibrosis (CF), caused by CFTR gene mutations, primarily affects the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. Microbiota modulation through probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics may help restore microbial diversity and reduce inflammation. This study aimed to evaluate their efficacy in CF. Materials and Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 2000 and 2024 was conducted in Cochrane, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, LILAC, BMC, PubMed, and SCOPUS following PRISMA guidelines. Methodological quality was assessed using the Jadad scale, and RevMan 5.4® estimated effects on pulmonary function (FEV1), exacerbations, hospitalizations, quality of life, and inflammatory markers. Results: Thirteen RCTs (n = 552), mostly in pediatric populations, were included. Most examined probiotics (e.g., Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. reuteri), while four used synbiotics. Several studies reported reduced fecal calprotectin and proinflammatory interleukins (e.g., IL-6, IL-8), suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect. However, no significant differences were observed regarding hospitalizations or quality of life. Additionally, none of the studies documented serious adverse events associated with the intervention. The meta-analysis showed no significant decrease in exacerbations (RR = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.48-1.37; p = 0.43) or improvements in FEV1 (MD = 4.7; 95% CI = -5.4 to 14.8; p = 0.37), even in subgroup analyses. Sensitivity analyses did not modify the effect of the intervention on pulmonary function or exacerbation frequency, supporting the robustness of the findings. Conclusions: Current evidence suggests that probiotics or synbiotics yield inconsistent clinical benefits in CF, although some reduction in inflammatory markers may occur. Larger, multicenter RCTs with longer follow-up are needed for clearer conclusions. Until more definitive evidence is available, these supplements should be considered experimental adjuncts rather than standard interventions for CF management.",

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of morbidity worldwide. In Algeria, it ranks second in mortality-related deaths. Poor lifestyle, characterized by a low-fiber diet, insufficient physical activity, tobacco use, and alcohol consumption, is strongly associated with an increased risk of developing this disease. Probiotics have demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antitumor effects in preclinical and clinical studies. The World Health Organization (WHO) and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have recognized their safety and effectiveness, classifying them as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) and Qualified Presumption of Safety (QPS), respectively. Probiotics exhibit immunomodulatory effects and maintain the equilibrium of the gut microbiota. However, the evidence for their clinical efficacy is inadequate, and additional research is requisite to establish them as therapeutic agents rather than simply as dietary supplements. Although probiotics are, in most cases, safe, high-risk patients should exercise caution due to the potential risk of infection. This review examines the current knowledge on probiotic strains, their therapeutic potential for colorectal cancer, limitations, and areas where further research is imperative to improve their efficacy."

      "abstract": "The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) has emerged as a critical frontier in understanding neurological disorders, including epilepsy. Microbial disequilibrium potentially alters brain homeostasis and could potentiate an inflammatory state linking intestinal dysbiosis and intractable seizures. The current study sought to probe the anti-kindling, electrographical, behavioral and neuropathological impacts of combined intervention of probiotics (PRO; 10 ml/kg) and pregabalin (PRG; 10 mg/kg) in PTZ-induced epileptic mice for 21 days. Adult BALB/c mice were kindled via subthreshold dose of (PTZ 40 mg/kg) until mice reached seizure stage of 4-5. After the procedure, mice were tested using a set of behavioral tests, and redox alterations along with cellular pathology were assessed. vEEG monitoring revealed that kindling instigated recurrent polyspikes of high amplitude with generalized epileptic seizures which were markedly impeded in the mice treated with dual regime suggesting potential preventive impact of probiotic therapy on neuronal hyperexcitability. Additionally, combination intervention exerted positive behavioral outcomes as it ameliorated anxiety and depressive-like phenotypes along with cognitive impairments (P < 0.05) vs. PTZ control. Moreover, probiotic and pregabalin therapy incurred gut-microbiota antioxidant neuroprotection and prevented morbid neurodegeneration as evidenced by decreased production of oxidative stressors (MDA and AchE; p < 0.01) and increase in activity of antioxidant factors (SOD; P < 0.01 and CAT; P < 0.05). Furthermore, these commensal species and PRG duo regulates inflammation and halted neuronal apoptosis in CA1 and CA3 subfields of the cornu-ammonis. Overall, our findings support probiotics as an adjuvant therapy to shift treatment paradigms in drug-resistant epilepsy by altering gut-microbiome pathological neural links.",

Probiotics, known for their beneficial effects on gut microbiota, have emerged as potential therapeutic agents for improving sexual health. This systematic review evaluates the impact of probiotics on sexual function, hormonal regulation, and reproductive outcomes. A comprehensive search identified 3308 studies, with 12 meeting the inclusion criteria-comprising 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 2 in vivo and in vitro studies. Probiotic interventions were shown to significantly improve sexual function, particularly in women undergoing antidepressant therapy (p < 0.05). Significant improvements in Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) scores were observed, with combined treatments such as Lactofem with Letrozole and Lactofem with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) demonstrating a 10% biochemical and clinical pregnancy rate compared to 0% in the control group (p = 0.05). Probiotic use was also associated with a 66% reduction in menopausal symptoms, increased sperm motility (36.08%), viability (46.79%), and morphology (36.47%). Probiotics also contributed to favorable hormonal changes, including a reduced luteinizing hormone (LH) to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) ratio (from 3.0 to 2.5, p < 0.05) and increased testosterone levels. Regarding reproductive outcomes, probiotic use was associated with higher pregnancy rates in women undergoing fertility treatments and improvements in sperm motility, viability, and morphology in men. This review highlights the promising role of probiotics in addressing sexual dysfunction and reproductive health, suggesting their potential as adjunctive treatments for conditions such as depression and infertility. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms of these beneficial effects."

      "abstract": "Current treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) relies on anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents. However, this concept is considered outdated due to its restricted efficacy and unavoidable side effects. Herein, a polynorepinephrine-coated programmable probiotic expressing α-aminoadipate aminotransferase (NE-EcN-pA) was constructed to improve the levels of kynurenic acid and xanthurenic acid in the intestine by modulating the endogenous tryptophan metabolism. The NE layer could protect EcN-pA against the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract, enhancing its survival and colonization. In UC mice, oral administration of NE-EcN-pA effectively alleviated intestinal inflammation and restored the intestinal epithelial barrier owing to the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor pathway. Furthermore, NE-EcN-pA promoted the diversity of intestinal flora, improved the imbalance of flora, and enhanced the content of short-chain fatty acids in the colon. Overall, NE-EcN-pA can regulate endogenous tryptophan metabolism and gut microbiota, showing promise in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders.",

Without intervention, a significant proportion of aBV would progress. Metronidazole is the most widely used treatment for aBV, yet the main challenge has always been the high rate of recurrence. Probiotics may increase the cure rate and reduce the recurrence rate of symptomatic bacterial vaginosis (sBV), while no study has compared the efficacy of probiotics and metronidazole on treating aBV. This study aims to fill the gap in understanding the difference in efficacy of probiotics and metronidazole in treating aBV by a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial. Participants received either a 10-day intravaginal probiotic capsules or a 7-day oral metronidazole. Follow-up were performed at the end of the 1st, 2nd, and 4th week after completing therapy. Women cured by either method were followed up with three additional visits. The primary outcome was the difference of cure rates between the two groups. The secondary outcome was to evaluate the recurrence rates among patients who were successfully cured using either method. 358 participants received probiotics and another 358 participants received metronidazole. The cumulative cure rates at the end of the 1st, 2nd, and 4th week were higher in probiotics group compared to metronidazole group (OR 1.063, P = 0.715; OR 1.324, P = 0.083; OR 1.338, P = 0.071), while the differences were not statistically significant. Women cured (144 in probiotics and 123 in metronidazole) were followed up. The difference of cumulative recurrence rates between the two groups were statistically significant at the end of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th month (OR 0.212, P = 0.000; OR 0.160, P = 0.000; OR 0.119, P = 0.000). Adverse events were similar in the two groups (8.3%, 9.6% OR 0.858; P = 0.584). No life-threatening or severe adverse events were reported. Probiotics emerge as a superior therapeutic option for aBV due to their comparable cure rates, lower recurrence rates, and minimal side effects.

      "abstract": "Depression exhibits a complex and multifaceted pathophysiology, accompanied by high rates of relapse and disability with current medication treatments. 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) is a promising candidate for depression therapy, but its poor pharmacokinetics hinders its clinical application. To address this limitation, we introduced the hydroxylase XcP4H into Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) to biosynthesize 5-HTP in vivo. To create a high-yielding EcN strain for 5-HTP production, we engineered XcP4H through enzyme-directed evolution using a novel genetic code expansion-based high-throughput screening method. The most effective XcP4H variant achieved a 22-fold increase in 5-HTP production, and molecular dynamic simulations elucidated the underlying mechanisms. After pathway engineering and gene editing, we further improved the 5-HTP yield in EcN. When the most robust strain, EcN@5-HTP, was employed as a live therapeutic, it alleviated depressive-like behaviors in mice by increasing 5-HT levels in both the gut and brain, repairing neurological abnormalities, inhibiting inflammation, elevating SCFAs concentrations, and modulating gut microbiota dysbiosis. By integrating synthetic biology with enzyme-directed evolution, we successfully addressed the pharmacokinetic limitations of 5-HTP through a live therapeutic approach. This proof-of-concept design clearly demonstrates that combining synthetic biology with probiotics has the potential to significantly revolutionize our strategies for disease detection, prevention, and treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Allergic diseases are an increasingly serious health issue worldwide, affecting not only the physiological health of patients but also significantly reducing their quality of life, thereby imposing a substantial economic burden on families and society. According to data from the World Health Organization, the incidence of allergic diseases has risen markedly over the past few decades, particularly among children and adolescents, making it a significant public health challenge. Although several clinical studies have explored the effects of probiotics in the treatment of food-induced allergies and allergic diseases, the results have been inconsistent. Some studies indicate positive effects, while others fail to demonstrate their efficacy. Therefore, a systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of probiotics in allergic diseases is particularly important. Some studies indicate that patients with food allergies may also experience respiratory symptoms, and certain foods may be associated with the onset or exacerbation of allergic rhinitis and asthma. Diseases such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, and atopic dermatitis are characterized by inappropriate immune responses to typically harmless environmental allergens. The incidence of these diseases is continuously rising in urban populations, prompting researchers to extensively explore novel therapeutic strategies that can effectively modulate immune responses. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to systematically assess the effectiveness of probiotics in the treatment of allergic diseases. By integrating the results of existing clinical studies, we hope to provide a clearer scientific basis for the treatment of allergic diseases. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature search in databases such as PubMed for articles published before the end of 2023 that evaluated the effectiveness of probiotics in treating allergic diseases. Inclusion criteria focused on studies reporting binary outcomes related to the efficacy of probiotics in patients with food allergies, asthma, allergic rhinitis, or atopic dermatitis. Data were collected using Excel software, and the Review Manager software was used to analyze the collected binary variable data. The effectiveness of probiotics was assessed by calculating the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated using the I2 statistic, and publication bias was assessed through funnel plots. RESULTS: The analysis of the aggregated binary data indicates that probiotics significantly improve clinical outcomes in patients with allergic diseases. Additional analysis using continuous variables (scores) further demonstrates the effectiveness of probiotics in alleviating allergic diseases. Subgroup analyses show that probiotics are effective in treating various common conditions, with two specific probiotics strains being particularly effective for allergic diseases. CONCLUSION: We included literature involving pediatric patients with common allergic diseases, Probiotics can help treat allergic diseases by modulating immune mechanisms, but allergic diseases are typically caused by multiple factors and individual variations, however, allergic diseases are typically caused by multiple factors and individual variations, so they should not be used as the sole treatment method.This meta-analysis provides evidence supporting the effectiveness of probiotics in various allergic diseases. The findings suggest that probiotics can serve as a beneficial adjunctive therapy for the treatment of these conditions. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: https://clinicaltrials.gov/, CRD42024586317."

METHODS: Clinical data of 141 obese PCOS patients treated in the 73rd Group Army Hospital from June 2021 to December 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were grouped according to the treatment records: metformin group (n=69), patients treated with metformin and a calorie-restricted diet) and combined group (n=72, patients treated with probiotics combined with metformin and a calorie-restricted diet). Levels of endocrine hormone indicators, Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), Fasting blood glucose (FPG), gut microbiota status, and Body mass index (BMI) were compared before and after the treatment in two groups. RESULTS: After the treatment, the levels of endocrine hormone indicators, HOMA-IR, and FPG in both groups were significantly reduced compared to pre-treatment levels and were significantly lower in the combined group compared to the metformin group (P<0.05). Abundance of gut microbiota and Shannon Wiener diversity index in both groups significantly increased after the treatment and were markedly higher in the combined group than in the metformin group (P<0.05). Treatment led to a significant reduction in the body mass index (BMI) in all patients (P<0.05). However, post-treatment BMI was comparable in the two groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In obese patients with PCOS, adding probiotics to the metformin and calorie-restricted diet regimen is more effective in regulating hormone levels, improving blood sugar and insulin resistance, regulating gut microbiota status, and reducing BMI than metformin combined with calorie-restricted diet alone."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Probiotics usually have beneficial effects on the absorption of trace elements and detoxification of toxic metals in human. Hence, the aim of the systematic review was to evaluate various aspects of the effect of the combination of probiotics and heavy metals in human clinical trial studies. METHODS: Nine databases were searched for clinical trials up to June 2024 investigating probiotics for heavy metal exposure in humans. Two reviewers independently screened records and extracted data on study characteristics, interventions, outcomes, and results. Risk of bias was assessed. RESULTS: The analysis included 31 clinical trials with a total of 4,611 participants, focusing on the effects of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics. Among the trials, 23 investigated probiotics, five looked at prebiotics, and three explored synbiotics, with probiotic doses ranging from 107 to 2.5 × 1010 CFU/day. Results indicated that probiotics combined with zinc significantly reduced the time to resolution of vomiting and diarrhea compared to zinc alone, improved the treatment efficacy of antibiotic-associated diarrhea linked to pneumonia, and shortened hospital stays relative to probiotics alone. Probiotics did not show significant effects on blood parameters compared to placebo; however, prebiotic galactooligosaccharides enhanced iron absorption in women and children. The addition of probiotics to bismuth quadruple therapy did not improve Helicobacter pylori eradication rates but reduced side effects like diarrhea and vomiting. One trial reported a decrease in toxic metal levels in pregnant women due to probiotics, but no similar effects were observed in children. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics are one of the new methods employed to improve or eliminate the adverse effects of heavy metals in the body. Although many studies have investigated the effects of probiotics on heavy metals, there is still a need for more in-depth and extensive studies."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: The prevalence of Parkinson's Disease (PD) is high, and treatment is not optimal to date. Curcumin possesses neuroprotective effects. Nevertheless, oral use is incommodious due to its poor bioavailability. Numerous attempts have been made to increase its systemic bioavailability. Among these, an effective way to increase the bioavailability of curcumin is by combining it with probiotics to target the glucuronidation reaction. The present study focuses on the bio-enhancement of curcumin using probiotics in animal models of PD by alleviating oxidative stress and ameliorating dopamine levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two male rats were used for the study. Twelve animals were used for a bio-availability study in which curcumin was administered orally alone and concomitantly with a probiotic (Lactobacillus Rhamnus, 109 cfu, PO) to prove probiotics' ability to enhance curcumin's serum level by inhibition of β-glucuronidase activity. Serum curcumin level was estimated using the LC-MS/MS technique on 21 days of dosing. The remaining animals were used in an experimental study. PD was induced through 2.5 mg/kg rotenone (ROT). Subsequently, the animals were allocated to five groups and treated commensurately along with ROT. Three treatment groups were administered curcumin (alone, with 108 cfu, with 109 cfu). The standard control and disease control groups were supplied with sunflower oil. Effect on behavioral patterns, neurotransmitter and enzyme levels, and oxidative stress parameters were measured. Moreover, the brain was isolated for histopathology. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The bioavailability study revealed a significant (P-value <0.001) increase in the serum level of curcumin in concomitantly administered probiotics with curcumin-treated animals compared to curcumin-only treated animals. An experimental study showed improved behavioral parameters, brain dopamine level, acetylcholinesterase (AchE), and oxidative stress combined in the curcumin and L. Rhamnosus treated groups. A notable improvement in the histology of the brain was observed. These findings strongly indicate that combining L. Rhamnosus with curcumin may be an effective therapeutic solution."

      "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains an incurable condition, often accompanied by high rates of anxiety and depression, further diminishing the quality of life of patients. Endogenous gasotransmitters, such as carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H₂S), exhibit potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. However, their therapeutic application is limited by challenges in targeted delivery to affected tissues. Here, we propose a novel strategy for targeted gut delivery of CO/H2S through engineering Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) with CO/H2S-releasing copolymer (POSR) loading. This engineered probiotic (POSR@EcN) enhances EcN colonization in the intestine and enables controlled, localized release of CO/H2S at inflamed sites. The release of CO/H2S modulates inflammation, restores intestinal barrier integrity, and reshapes gut microbiota by promoting beneficial bacteria and increasing short-chain fatty acids production, effectively alleviating IBD symptoms. Notably, targeted CO/H2S delivery also elevates neuroprotective metabolites like indoleacetic acid and γ-aminobutyric acid, reducing neuroinflammation via the gut-brain axis and mitigating anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in IBD mice. This approach highlights the potential of EcN as a probiotic carrier for the targeted delivery of gasotransmitters, offering a promising strategy for IBD treatment."

      "abstract": "Dysbiosis in gut microbiota and abnormalities in bile acids have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases. While many studies have focused on the relationship between colonic bacteria and Alzheimer's disease (AD), this study propose that alterations in the small intestine microbiota may play a more critical role. This is because the small intestine is pivotal in recycling bile acids through enterohepatic circulation. This study uses amyloid precursor protein knock-in (APPNL-G-F/NL-G-F) transgenic mice to investigate the association between intestinal microbiota and bile acid metabolism. The results showed that the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) leads to a significant decrease in Lactobacillus johnsonii and a notable increase in bacteria of the genus Clostridium in the small intestine, which are important microorganisms for producing toxic bile acids. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) involved in bacterial interactions and bacteria-host interactions are currently a focus of research. Treatment with L. johnsonii-derived EVs at concentrations of 1010 and 1012/mL) inhibited the growth of Clostridium scindens and suppressed the production of toxic secondary lithocholic acid (TLA) at non-cytotoxic concentrations (108/mL). Furthermore, the removal of small RNA from L. johnsonii-derived EVs resulted in the loss of their ability to suppress TLA production. These results suggest that the small intestine microbiota may play a more critical role than the colonic microbiota in AD. Deterioration of small intestine microbiota led to the metabolism disruption of certain secondary bile acids, which have been reported to exacerbate AD pathology. The EVs released by L. johnsonii, which is abundant in the small intestine, can suppress toxic TLA and have the potential to be developed into health-promoting probiotics.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are prevalent in children, prompting frequent health care consultations, especially among those with fever. Probiotics show potential as an adjuvant treatment for URTIs, but evidence in children is limited. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a probiotic mixture containing Bifidobacterium breve M-16V, Bifidobacterium lactis HN019, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 in shortening fever duration among children with URTIs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted between November 19, 2021, and June 20, 2023, at the pediatric emergency department of the Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico in Milan, Italy. Patients between 28 days and 4 years of age with a fever (≥38.5 °C) and URTI were eligible. Exclusion criteria included recent probiotic use, chronic autoimmune diseases, immunosuppressive treatment, and requirement for hospitalization. Randomization was computer generated and assigned participants to either the intervention (probiotics) or control (placebo) group. Participants, parents or caregivers, and investigators were masked to the group assignments. The primary analysis followed the intention-to-treat approach. INTERVENTIONS: The probiotic group received daily single dose of 0.5 mL probiotic mixture containing Bifidobacterium breve M-16V, Bifidobacterium lactis HN019, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 for 14 days. The placebo group received daily single dose of 0.5 mL placebo for 14 days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was fever duration, defined as the number of days between the first and the last days with fever. RESULTS: Of the 128 patients enrolled (69 males [54%]; mean [SD] age 2.5 [1.3] years), 65 (51%) were randomly assigned to receive placebo and 63 (49%) to receive probiotics. The median (IQR) fever duration was shorter in the probiotic group than the placebo group (median [IQR], 3 [2-4] days vs 5 [4-6] days; adjusted risk ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51-0.80). Few mild adverse events were reported and did not significantly differ between the probiotic and placebo groups, including constipation (6 [16%] and 6 [12%]; P = .80) and abdominal pain (3 [8%] and 2 [4%]; P = .65). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, administering a probiotic mixture reduced fever duration by 2 days compared with placebo, with no meaningful safety concerns. The probiotic mixture under investigation could be an effective adjuvant for shortening fever duration in children with URTIs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT06052540.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objective: Rifaximin is a nonabsorbable antibiotic used to treat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Recent studies on Helicobacter pylori eradication treatment have reported synergistic effects and low adverse effects when antibiotics are used in combination with probiotics; yet, such studies have not been conducted in IBS. Probiotics can enhance gut microbiota modulation, inhibition of pathogen adhesion to the gut epithelia, improvement in gut barrier function, anti-inflammatory effects, and improvement of gut immunity. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of rifaximin in combination with probiotics compared to rifaximin monotherapy in patients with IBS. Methods: Patients with IBS were randomly allocated to receive rifaximin monotherapy or a combination of rifaximin and probiotics. The primary outcome was the response rate of the total IBS severity scoring system (IBS-SSS) score (>50-point decrease). Secondary outcomes were based on the response rate of the IBS quality of life (IBS-QOL) score and the IBS-SSS1 subscore (>10-point decrease in both scores). Results: Among 70 patients, the responder rates for the total IBS-SSS score were 65.7% in the combination therapy group and 31.4% in the monotherapy group at weeks 4 and 8, respectively (p = 0.004). The responder rates for IBS-QOL were 65.7% versus (vs.) 37.1% and 65.7% vs. 34.2% at weeks 4 and 8, respectively (p = 0.017 and p = 0.009, respectively). The IBS-SSS1 subscore responder rates were 65.7% vs. 40.0% at week 4 and 68.6% vs. 37.1% at 8 weeks (p = 0.031 and p = 0.017, respectively). Conclusions: Rifaximin combined with probiotics was superior to rifaximin monotherapy in patients with IBS. This combination therapy is considered an effective and safe treatment option for patients with IBS. However, further studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms of therapy and long-term outcomes.",

Chronic inflammatory responses can impair kidney function and probiotics and postbiotics agents can have positive effects on gut health and kidney function by modulating inflammation through affecting autophagy signaling pathway. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the properties of our probiotic and postbiotics to improve kidney health by focusing the autophagy signaling pathway. The probiotic and postbiotics of four Lactobacillus and two Bifidobacterium strains were selected. Dextran sulfate sodium induced colitis in mice, and probiotics and postbiotics treatments were accomplished in animal experiment. A qPCR assay was performed to assess the gene expression involved in the autophagy process in the kidney. In contrast to the dextran sulfate sodium group, both the probiotic and postbiotics cocktails exhibited the capacity to inhibit colitis-associated indicators. Of note, the postbiotics cocktails demonstrated a greater efficacy in preventing colitis-related indicators and also it could display a more pronounced effect in upregulating autophagy-related genes. Our native potential probiotics and postbiotics can be able to reduce gut inflammation and cope with kidney inflammation by triggering autophagy signaling pathway through the considerable impact on gut-organ axis. There is an encouraging concept about the anti-inflammatory effects of our probiotics and postbiotics cocktails with least side effects as a supplementary treatment not only in the gut, but also in the other organs particularly kidneys."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinometabolic disorder affecting women of reproductive age, characterized by hormonal imbalances, irregular menstrual cycles, and often, infertility. Hypothalamic amenorrhea, a condition marked by the cessation of menstruation due to disruptions in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, is a frequent manifestation in PCOS. Probiotics, beneficial microorganisms known for improving metabolic health, have shown promise in restoring hormonal balance and enhancing fertility. In this study, we hypothesize that probiotics would ameliorate hypothalamic amenorrhea by modulating hypothalamic kisspeptin and reducing inflammation in a rat model of PCOS. METHODS: Eight (8)-week-old female Wistar rats were grouped into four with n = 5. Letrozole administration (1 mg/kg, p.o.) for 21 days induced PCOS, thereafter the animals were treated with probiotics (3 × 109 CFU, p.o.), while control animals received distilled water. The treatment lasted for six weeks. RESULTS: Reduced insulin sensitivity, hyperinsulinemia, ovarian dysfunction with evidence of disrupted steroid hormone levels (testosterone/17β-Estradiol) and cystic follicles as well as hypothalamic lipid accumulation, elevated inflammatory markers (NF-kB/TNF-α) and antioxidant depletion (GSH/NrF2), which are accompanied by decreased level of kisspeptin. Nonetheless, administration of probiotics reversed these pathological alterations by enhancement of hypothalamic kisspeptin and suppression of inflammatory response. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, the present results demonstrate that probiotics significantly ameliorated hypothalamic amenorrhea by mitigating hypothalamic lipid accumulation, suppressed inflammation, and replenished antioxidants. Crucially, probiotics enhanced hypothalamic kisspeptin levels, a key regulator of reproductive function, highlighting their potential as a therapeutic strategy for restoring ovarian function in PCOS.",

      "abstract": "Hyperlipidemia, a metabolic disorder marked by dysregulated lipid metabolism, is a key contributor to the onset and progression of various chronic diseases. Maintaining normal lipid metabolism is critical for health, as disruptions lead to dyslipidemia. The gut and liver play central roles in lipid homeostasis, with their bidirectional communication, known as the gut-liver axis, modulated by bile acids (BAs), gut microbiota, and their metabolites. BAs are essential for regulating their own synthesis, lipid metabolism, and anti-inflammatory responses, primarily through the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5). Available evidence suggests that high-fat diet-induced the gut microbiota dysbiosis can induce \"leaky gut,\" allowing toxic microbial metabolites to enter the liver via portal circulation, triggering liver inflammation and lipid metabolism disturbances, ultimately leading to hyperlipidemia. Extensive studies have highlighted the roles of probiotics and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in restoring gut-liver axis balance and modulating lipid metabolism through regulating the levels of lipopolysaccharides, short-chain fatty acids, and BAs. However, the therapeutic potential of probiotics and TCM for hyperlipidemia remains unclear. Here, firstly, we explore the intricate interplay among gut microbiota and metabolites, lipid metabolism, gut-liver axis, and hyperlipidemia. Secondly, we summarize the mechanisms by which probiotics and TCM can alleviate hyperlipidemia by altering the composition of gut microbiota and regulating lipid metabolism via the gut-liver axis. Finally, we emphasize that more clinical trials of probiotics and TCM are necessary to examine their effects on lipid metabolism and hyperlipidemia.",

Despite significant advancements, developing a green and safe coating technology that functionalizes probiotics with nanozymes while preserving the activity of both components remains a challenge. To address this, chitosan-modified epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG-CS, EC)is synthesized, leveraging the intrinsic adhesive and coordination properties of polyphenols to capture gold nanozymes (AuNPs), forming ECA complexes that enhance nanozyme activity. When coated onto Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), the resulting ECA@EcN system effectively scavenged reactive oxygen species (ROS), improving probiotic viability and promoting colon accumulation. Mechanistically, ECA protected EcN by suppressing the activation of the Flagellar Assembly and Branched-Chain Amino Acid Synthesis pathways, ultimately alleviating inflammation and modulating intestinal microbial communities to relieve IBD symptoms. Given the biocompatibility of its components and the environmentally friendly assembly approach, this polyphenol-nanozyme-armored probiotic system represents a promising platform for IBD treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Infertility treatments are continually evolving, with vaginal probiotic supplementation before embryo transfer (ET) being explored as a potential method to improve clinical outcomes. So, this systematic review evaluated the effect of vaginal probiotics on pregnancy rates following ET. METHODS: Studies were identified through PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, and clinical trial registries up to October 17, 2024. We included prospective interventional studies (RCTs or quasi-experimental) focusing on pregnancy outcomes post-ET. We excluded non-prospective studies, non-vaginal routes of probiotic administration, and studies with insufficient methodological or statistical details. The data was extracted from each qualifying study by two reviewers and recorded using an electronic form. Results were synthesized using a random-effects model, with Mantel-Haenszel (MH) risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) calculated for ET outcomes. Also, subgroup analyses were done to explore the history of recurrent implantation failure (RIF) as a probable source of heterogeneity. RESULTS: We included six studies with 850 participants (419 in intervention and 431 in control groups). Vaginal probiotics showed a non-significant increase in clinical pregnancy rates compared to the control group (157 per 419 [37.47%] versus 136 per 431 [31.55%], respectively; RR: 1.19; P = 0.07), with similar findings in women with and without a history of RIF. No significant differences were found in biochemical pregnancy (RR: 1.04; P = 0.74) or ongoing pregnancy rates (RR: 1.09; P = 0.53). A non-significant reduction in miscarriage risk was observed (RR: 0.67; P = 0.12). CONCLUSIONS: Vaginal probiotics may offer a non-significant increase in clinical pregnancy rates and a slight non-significant reduction in miscarriage risk. However, considering the potential limitations of the included studies, findings should be interpreted with caution. Further research is needed to explore the potential of personalized probiotic therapy. PROSPERO REGISTRATION CODE: CRD42024550798.",

Here, we have explored and evaluated multiple synbiotic combinations incorporating three distinctive prebiotics, lactitol, lactulose and fructooligosaccharides. Of the synbiotic treatments evaluated, a combination of fructooligosaccharides and probiotics (FOS+Pro) exhibited superior protection against western diet-induced liver degeneration. This synbiotic (FOS+Pro) combination resulted in the lowest body weight gains, liver weights and liver/body weight ratios. The FOS+Pro synbiotic combination substantially alleviated liver histopathological markers and reduced serum AST and cholesterol levels. FOS+Pro ameliorated hepatic inflammation by lowering expression of proinflammatory markers including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and CCL2. FOS+Pro significantly improved steatosis by restricting the expression of lipid metabolic regulators (ACC1, FAS) and lipid transporters (CD36) in the liver. These findings are critical in suggesting that synbiotic treatments are capable of restraining western diet-induced metabolic dysfunction in the liver. Additionally, this study demonstrated that adding probiotic strains amplified the effectiveness of fructooligosaccharides but not all prebiotics.",

      "abstract": "Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND) refer to a constellation of symptoms that primarily affect the elderly and typically manifest as common complications after exposure to surgery and anesthesia. PND is associated with high morbidity, mortality, and progression to neurodegenerative diseases, thus exerting significant financial strains on families as well as the healthcare system. Given that an ageing global population is an inevitable trend and, with the latest advances in the healthcare system, an ever-growing number of elderly people present for surgery and anesthesia, PND is of prominent concern. The two-way communication between the intestinal flora and the brain, also known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis, plays an important role in central nervous system development, and multiple studies have highlighted the influence exerted by gut microbiome in both health and disease. Pertinent studies have corroborated the fact that anesthesia and surgery disrupt the harmony of the gut ecology, which sets off a cascade of events that initiate neuroinflammation, eventually leading to PND. Probiotics, which are live microorganisms that promote the host's health, have been shown as a viable option to restore or minimise the disruption of gut flora. Evidence exists that probiotics exhibit immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory benefits. Given the effectiveness of probiotics in reducing neuroinflammation, research has also focused on their impact on the development of PND. This review aims to compile the data from relevant clinical trials focusing on the influence of probiotics on PND to determine whether the derived findings might be applied for the prevention and treatment of PND."

      "abstract": "Alcoholic liver disease is one of the diseases with a high mortality rate worldwide, resulting from excessive and chronic alcohol consumption. With the rapid rise of intestinal microbial research, more and more researchers have begun to focus on the role of probiotics in preventing, alleviating or treating diseases. In this study, effects of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), a general type of probiotic, isolated from the fermented grains of Chinese baijiu, on alcohol-induced liver injury and alcohol metabolism were investigated, and the results showed that Lactiplantibacillus pentosus LTJ12, Pediococcus acidilactici LTJ28, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum LTJ30, and Pediococcus acidilactici LTJ32 could prevent drunkenness and sober up, and had a good protective effect on alcoholic liver injury. These LAB, especially Lactiplantibacillus, can reduce the drunken rate and mortality of drinking mice, shorten the sobriety time, decrease the content of ethanol in serum, reduce the activity or content of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), triglyceride (TG) and malondialdehyde (MDA), increase the activity or content of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) and nitric oxide (NO), and also improve the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) of the liver. The LAB intervention basically reversed the changes in the mRNA levels of genes related to ethanol/drug metabolism (CYP2E1, ADH1 and ALDH2), antioxidant markers (SOD2 and CAT), cellular inflammation, apoptosis and proliferation (SIRT1, SMYD3 and BRD4) and lipid metabolism (SREBP1 and FASn). In addition, we have found that the regulatory effect of these probiotics may be related to the SMYD3/BRD4 pathway, which needs further detailed research. Besides, the probiotics increased the abundance of gut microbes, restored the imbalance of the intestinal flora caused by alcohol consumption, and regulated the changes in the intestinal short-chain fatty acid content caused by chronic alcohol consumption. These results suggested that these baijiu-derived probiotics can effectively prevent drunkenness and chronic alcoholic liver injury. It is of great significance to provide scientific basis for subsequent research and development of new anti-alcoholism health products based on probiotics and the intestinal microecological regulation mechanism.",

Gerobiotics, an emerging concept in geroscience, offers a novel approach to repurposing selective probiotics, postbiotics, and parabiotics to modulate key aging processes and enhance systemic health. This review explores recent advancements in gerobiotics research, focusing on their role in targeting aging hallmarks, regulating longevity-associated pathways, and reducing risks of multiple age-related chronic conditions. Despite their promise, significant challenges remain, including optimizing formulations, ensuring safety and efficacy across diverse populations, and achieving successful clinical translation.

METHODS: Eighty-six mild-to-moderate UC patients were selected as study subjects and randomized into the control group (treated with mesalazine enteric-coated tablets [Salofalk]) and the observation group (treated with mesalazine enteric-coated tablets, Bifidobacterium Tetravaccine Tablets, and Yiyi Baitouweng Decoction retention enema). The clinical efficacy, colonoscopy score, serum levels of inflammatory factors, and the incidence of adverse reactions were compared. RESULTS: The clinical efficacy of patients in the observation group was better in contrast to the control group. After 8 weeks of treatment, the colonoscopy score, and levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ, CRP, and ESR were lower, while IL-10 levels were higher in patients of both groups than those before treatment; lower colonoscopy score and levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ, CRP, and ESR and higher IL-10 levels were observed in the observation group versus the control group. CONCLUSION: Probiotics combined with mesalazine and Yiyi Baitouweng Decoction retention enema have remarkable clinical effects in treating mild-to-moderate UC."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The gut-brain axis plays a crucial role in mitigating the adverse effects of environmental agents such as nickel exposure. Nickel, recognized as a heavy metal, poses significant concerns for public health because of its impact on neurological disorders and oxidative stress; consequently, it is prioritized for evaluations of its effects on biological pathways. This study investigates the potential of native probiotic strains to modulate inflammatory and autophagy signaling pathways, which are vital for combating oxidative stress. METHODS: Twenty male NMRI mice were divided into 4 groups randomly and were gavaged with NiCl2, followed by administration of a probiotic cocktail that consisted of 4 native probiotic Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. Brain tissues from these treated mice were collected to analyze the expression of autophagy-related genes involved in phagophore, autophagosome, and autolysosome formation using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated that treatment with this cocktail of native probiotic Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. significantly increased the expression of autophagy genes compared to the control group exposed to NiCl2 alone. Specifically, there was a notable upregulation in genes associated with autophagic processes, indicating that these probiotic strains effectively activated autophagy pathways in response to nickel-induced oxidative stress. CONCLUSION: The beneficial effects of our native probiotic strains were confirmed through enhanced expression of autophagy genes and reduced neuroinflammation, suggesting their potential as therapeutic agents in mitigating the adverse impacts of nickel exposure on brain health via modulation of the gut-brain axis.",

      "abstract": "Reducing L-lactate levels in tumors is crucial for alleviating immunosuppression and enhancing treatment efficacy. Recently, bacteria have great potential in improving lactate levels in the tumor microenvironment due to their physiological properties, tumor tropism, and immunogenicity. However, developing bacterial-based lactate regulation platforms is still facing great challenges due to bacterial modification impacts on activity, macrophage phagocytosis, and complex tumor microenvironment. Herein, an engineered Lactobacillus acidophilus (LH@LA) is developed, armed with a polymeric stealth coating that co-loads lactate oxidase (LOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP). This coating protects bacteria from macrophage phagocytosis, maintaining their activity for deep tumor drug delivery. And then, LOx and HRP can consume much L-lactate in the tumor site through an enzyme cascade reaction to improve the immunosuppressive environment, while causing oxidative stress and reduced ATP supply, thereby reversing AKT-mTOR metabolic pathway activation to inhibit tumor growth. More interestingly, LA not only acts as a natural enzyme's carrier, but also induces anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages to polarize into pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages by secreting D-lactate, enhancing antitumor immunotherapy. This engineered probiotic design provides a new idea for building a safe and efficient live bacteria delivery platform, providing a reference for developing cancer treatment strategies with clinical translation prospects.",

The human gut microbial eubiosis with functional probiotics and their heat-killed cells of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) is considered the current therapy for metabolic syndrome (MS). In accordance with this, our study aimed to isolate oxalate-degrading, cholesterol-lowering, and anti-adipogenic bacterial strains from raw donkey's milk and homemade fermented pickles. Nine LAB strains with potential in vitro oxalate degrading, α-glucosidase inhibiting, and cholesterol-lowering activities were pre-screened from fourteen isolates. Further, the heat-killed cells of selected strains were evaluated for anti-adipogenic activity in murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes. This activity was examined by studying the lipid storage, gene, and protein expression of adipogenic and lipogenic transcription factors. Subsequently, four potential isolates demonstrated a significant reduction in lipid storage by limiting adipogenesis (reducing C/EBPα, PPARγ expression), lipid transportation (downregulating aP2 expression), and lipogenesis (reducing PLIN-1 expression). These effective isolates were characterized using 16S rRNA molecular sequencing, and were identified as closest relatives to the Enterococcus (RRLA5, RRLA1, and RRLD6) and Lactobacillus (RRLM2) genera. Further, they displayed good survivability under in vitro gastric conditions and non-haemolytic activity. Taken together, the live cells of effective isolates depicted significant in vitro oxalate degradation, and their heat-killed cells demonstrated anti-adipogenic activity through downregulating the adipogenesis and lipogenesis. Moreover, future preclinical animal model studies on the synergistic role of probiotics and their heat-killed cells in disease prevention through gut microbial modulation could provide evidence as a biotherapeutic agent.",

To address this issue, we explored the potential of single- and multi-strain probiotics, both independently and in combination with gentamicin, through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. In vitro, gentamicin alone produced a mean inhibition zone of 12.9 ± 2.27 mm against E. coli O157:H7. The combination of gentamicin with single-strain probiotics (P1) increased the inhibition zone to 16.5 ± 2.24 mm (p < 0.05), while the combination with multi-strain probiotics (P2) resulted in the largest inhibition zone of 19 ± 2.8 mm (p < 0.05). In vivo, mice infected with E. coli O157:H7 and treated with P2, gentamicin (G), or their combination (G+P2), achieved 100% survival, no pathological symptoms, and full weight recovery within seven days. Conversely, mice treated with P1 or G+P1 exhibited lower survival rates (71.4% and 85%, respectively) and slower weight recovery. Hematological parameters improved across all groups, but kidney function analysis showed significantly higher serum creatinine levels in the P1, G, G+P1, and G+P2 groups compared to the P2 group (P1: 0.63 ± 0.15 mg/dL; G: 0.34 ± 0.09 mg/dL; G+P1: 0.53 ± 0.19 mg/dL; G+P2: 0.5 ± 0.23 mg/dL vs. P2: 0.24 ± 0.2 mg/dL). Histological analysis showed better intestinal and kidney tissue recovery in the P2 group, while the P1 and G+P1 groups exhibited abnormal ileal structures and severe cortical bleeding. These findings highlight the promise of multi-strain probiotics, alone or in conjunction with antibiotics, as a therapeutic strategy for E. coli O157:H7 infections. However, the nephrotoxicity associated with gentamicin co-administration remains a limitation, warranting further studies to optimize this approach."

Probiotics have been proposed as a potential adjunct therapy for these conditions by altering the intestinal environment, although studies on their effectiveness have yielded mixed results. AIM: This study aims to evaluate the short-term (2 months) effects of a dietary supplement containing Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria, and Lactococcus bacillus on disease progression, remission, quality of life, and nutritional intake in Lebanese patients with CD. METHOD: A multicenter, randomized, single-blind controlled trial was conducted in 2 medical centers in Beirut from 1 April 2024 to 1 August 2024. Recruitment, prescreening, screening, enrollment, and protocol implementation were carried out at both centers. Data were collected from 21 patients with CD, who were randomly assigned to the control group (n = 10) and the intervention group (n = 11). At baseline and after two months, participants underwent clinical assessments, WHOQOL-BREF evaluation, and 24 h dietary recalls. Follow-up visits included surveys on disease progression, quality of life, adherence, and adverse events, along with repeat body composition and anthropometric measurements. RESULTS: Probiotic supplementation over two months did not significantly alter symptoms, flares, or hospitalizations outcomes between the control and intervention groups. However, the intervention group experienced notable increases in body weight (p = 0.01), BMI (p = 0.01), body fat mass (p = 0.04), and arm muscle circumference (p = 0.01). Nutrient intake patterns differed, with the intervention group showing increased consumption of calcium, riboflavin, and folate compared to controls (p = 0.01, p = 0.04, p = 0.013, respectively). Probiotic supplementation led to significant within-group increases in dietary fiber (p = 0.01), total sugar (p = 0.02), and caffeine (p = 0.01) among the intervention participants. Adverse effects in the intervention group were mild, including nausea (18.2%) and abdominal discomfort (9.1%). QOL improved significantly in the intervention group, particularly in physical (p = 0.03), psychological (p = 0.04), and environmental domains (p = 0.003), while the control group exhibited improvements only in psychological health. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the findings suggest that probiotics can enhance body composition, nutrient intake, and certain aspects of QOL among CD patients, despite minimal impact on disease symptoms or dietary patterns.",

The goal of this project was to evaluate the impact of administering an oral nutritional supplement combined with a probiotic blend on the microbiota, intestinal permeability, and depression symptoms in malnourished hemodialysis patients. METHODS: With this aim, a randomized trial was conducted with three parallel groups: a control group with individualized diet, a supplement-placebo (SU-PL) group with oral nutritional supplementation (ONS), and a supplement-probiotic (SU-PR) group with ONS in conjunction with a probiotic blend. Blood and fecal samples were collected at basal time, and at 3 and 6 months. Several blood biomarkers, like zonulin, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), were measured, and the fecal microbiome was sequenced with the Illumina platform. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used for the estimation of depression (HADS-D) and anxiety (HADS-A) symptoms, along with the standardized mental health index SF12-MH from the general health questionnaire SF-12. RESULTS: The results showed that patients who consumed the probiotic blend maintained the LPS levels from their baseline readings and decreased their BDNF levels compared to the SU-PL or control groups. Moreover, a significant decrease in HADS-D scores (less depressive symptoms) and an increase in SF12-MH scores (higher quality of life) were found in that group in comparison to the other groups. The intervention produced an impact on the microbiome population, where the SU-PR group had reduced Akkermansia abundance with respect to the other groups, while their Acidaminococcus abundance decreased and their Barnesiella abundance increased with respect to the SU-PL group. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results indicate that the probiotic with the nutritional supplement could reduce the intestinal permeability biomarkers and improve depressive symptoms and quality of life in malnourished hemodialysis patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Obesity is a growing global epidemic. The composition of the intestinal microbiota can be influenced by several factors. Studies highlight the role of intestinal bacteria in the pathophysiology of obesity. So, the objective of this study was to investigate whether the use of probiotics, together with healthy lifestyle habits, contributes to weight reduction in obese individuals by analyzing the intestinal microbiota profile. METHODS: A prospective study was carried out with 45 adults with obesity. Participants underwent guidance on healthy lifestyle habits, received a probiotic component containing different microbiological strains and were followed for 60 days. Clinical parameters, body composition, biochemical analysis, and intestinal microbiota assessment were performed before and after treatment. After 60 days, it was observed that the bacterial strains present in the probiotic were present in the patients' intestinal microbiota. Participants also showed improvements in physical activity, sleep quality, and anxiety management, as well as changes in some eating habits, such as a reduction in the consumption of processed foods and a significant increase in water intake. RESULTS: A reduction in BMI, fasting glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides was observed, in addition to an increase in HDL cholesterol, improvement in bowel movement frequency, and stool consistency. Analysis of the intestinal microbiota revealed an increase in microbial diversity and a better balance between the bacterial phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. CONCLUSIONS: The changes related to improving the composition of the intestinal microbiota, dietary habits, increased physical activity, reduced anxiety, and better sleep quality have significantly contributed to weight loss and improvements in physiological parameters in obese individuals."

      "abstract": "Aim: Halitosis is the unpleasant odor emitted from the oral cavity during exhalation and phonation. Using oral care products containing specific probiotics and paraprobiotics, combined with lifestyle changes, this study is aimed at resolving the patient's altered breath odor. Case Report: A 49-year-old male patient suffered from retronasal discharge, bacterial plaque on the back of his tongue, and bad breath. He underwent a professional oral hygiene session, received instructions in proper home oral hygiene techniques, and was advised on appropriate lifestyle changes. The use of oral care products based on probiotics and paraprobiotics was recommended. Sixty days later, the patient was reevaluated and was satisfied with the results, as his tongue had improved significantly, and he no longer experienced any bad sensations in his mouth. Conclusion: Systematic removal of bacterial biofilm and the use of probiotics and paraprobiotics can be useful in the prevention and treatment of halitosis."

      "abstract": "The increasing global prevalence of cancer, particularly breast cancer, necessitates the development of innovative therapeutic strategies. Probiotics, proficient in promoting gut health, have emerged as promising candidates for cancer treatment due to their immunomodulatory and potential anticancer properties. This review focuses on the therapeutic mechanisms of probiotics in breast cancer, examining their anticancer efficacy through metabolic, immune, and molecular mechanisms. Probiotics enhance cancer therapies, minimize side effects, and offer new adjuvant approaches in oncology. Recent advancements discussed in the review include the utilization of probiotics as oncolytic gene expression systems and drug delivery vectors, as well as personalized probiotic interventions aimed at optimizing cancer therapy. Clinical studies are critically evaluated, highlighting both the outcomes and limitations of probiotic use in cancer patients, particularly those suffering from breast cancer. Additionally, the review explores factors influencing anticancer effects of probiotics, focusing on their role in modulating the tumor microenvironment. Challenges in translating preclinical findings to clinical practice are discussed, along with future research directions, focusing on the relationship between probiotics, the microbiome, and cancer treatment. Ultimately, this review advocates for further investigation into the therapeutic potential of probiotics in breast cancer, aiming to harness their benefits in oncology.",

      "abstract": "Obesity can mediate the occurrence of many cardiovascular metabolic diseases, such as coronary heart disease and diabetes, which will lead to a significant increase in all-cause mortality in obese people. Visceral fat refers to the excessive accumulation of adipose tissue in abdominal organs, which can lead to impaired normal function of organs. In recent years, it has been reported that probiotics can reduce obesity and visceral fat content, and some studies have put forward the opposite conclusion. In order to guide the practice of nutrition, we use Meta-analysis method to analyze these conclusions. The authors searched randomized controlled trials on the effects of oral probiotics on body weight and visceral fat content in obese people published before January 2024 in several public databases, such as PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and CNKI. The primary outcome was body weight, and the secondary outcomes included BMI, waist circumference, visceral fat content, and low-density lipoprotein levels. This trial has been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024521353). A total of 8 randomized controlled trials involving 412 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed that the weight loss of the experimental group taking probiotics was significantly higher than that of the control group (P < 0.00001). The reduction of waist circumference in the experimental group taking probiotics was significantly different from that in the control group (P = 0.01). The decrease of visceral fat content in the experimental group taking probiotics was significantly different from that in the control group (P < 0.00001). There was no significant difference in BMI and LDL-C levels between the experimental group and the control group. Oral probiotics can reduce weight loss, waist circumference and visceral fat content in obese patients, which may be a potential nutritional treatment for obese patients in the future. However, whether oral probiotics can reduce BMI and LDL-C levels in obese patients needs to be included in more RCTs and further discussed in the future.",

DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library for relevant English-language studies published up to February 21st, 2024. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials evaluating perioperative probiotics or synbiotics for preventing postoperative infections in patients undergoing major liver surgery. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Outcomes included postoperative infection incidence, antibiotic therapy duration, length of stay in intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital. A random-effect model was adopted for the meta-analysis. The quality of included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: Ten studies involving 588 patients were included. Pooled analyses revealed that perioperative probiotics or synbiotics significantly reduced postoperative infection incidence (RR 0.36, 95% CI [0.24-0.54], P < 0.0001, I2 = 6%) and antibiotic therapy duration (MD -2.82, 95% CI [-3.13 to -2.51], P < 0.001, I2 = 0%). No significant differences were observed in length of stay in ICU (MD -0.25, 95% CI [-0.84-0.34], P = 0.41, I2 = 64%) or length of stay in hospital (MD -1.25, 95% CI [-2.74-0.25], P = 0.10, I2 = 56%). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that perioperative administration of probiotics or synbiotics may reduce the incidence of postoperative infections and duration of antibiotic therapy. Their use as adjunctive therapy during the perioperative period could be considered for patients undergoing major liver surgery.",

In Exp. 1, a total of 60 crossbred weaning pigs were randomly allotted to one of five dietary treatments. The dietary treatments included: negative control (NC; basal diet with no supplement), positive control (PC; basal diet with 0.01% Lactiplantibacillus plantarum [LP] containing 1.0 × 108 CFU/g), basal diet with 0.1% Pediococcus acidilactici K (K) containing 1.0 × 109 CFU/g (K), basal diet with 0.1% Pediococcus pentosaceus SMFM2016-WK1 (WK1) containing 1.0 × 109 CFU/g (WK1), basal diet with 0.05% K + 0.05% WK1 containing 1.0 × 109 CFU/g (K-WK1). The average daily gain (ADG) was higher in the K group than in the WK1 group. Diarrhea score was lower in the K-WK1 group than in the NC group. At the genus level, Roseburia abundance in WK1 was higher than in the other treatment groups. At the species level, Blautia wexlerae abundance was lower in WK1 than in the other groups, whereas Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens abundance was higher in WK1. The serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the PC and WK1 groups were as low as those in the NC group. Experiment 2 was conducted with two trials in a 2 × 5 factorial arrangement of treatments consisting of two levels of challenge (challenge and non-challenge) with E. coli and SE and five levels of probiotics same as Exp.1. Supplementation with LP and WK1 resulted in higher ADG and lower diarrhea scores than those in the other groups. Consequently, supplementation of WK1 showed a particularly positive effect on growth performance and diarrhea, villus height and intestinal microbiota in oral challenge experiment and feeding trial. Therefore, WK1 might be the most effective among the probiotics used in this experiment."

      "abstract": "Recurrent implantation failure (RIF) is a significant obstacle in assisted reproductive technology, affecting approximately 10 % of couples undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Emerging evidence suggests that vaginal probiotics and vitamin D supplementation may improve reproductive outcomes. This randomized clinical trial evaluated the effects of these interventions on fertility in women with RIF and thin endometrium (<6 mm). A total of 112 women with a history of RIF were randomized into four groups: vaginal probiotics, vitamin D supplementation, a combination of both, or standard IVF treatment (control). The primary outcome was the pregnancy rate, confirmed by β-hCG testing and ultrasound. Secondary outcomes included changes in Th1/Th2 ratio, natural killer (NK) cell activity, and cytokine profiles. The combination group demonstrated the highest pregnancy rate (46.4 %), which was significantly higher compared with the probiotics ((14.2 %), p = 0.008), vitamin D ((17.8 %), p = 0.002), and control groups ((10.7 %), p = 0.003). Only the combination therapy significantly reduced the Th1/Th2 ratio (p < 0.001) and NK cell activity (p < 0.001), while significantly increasing IL-4 and TGF-β and decreasing IFN-γ levels (all p < 0.001). These findings suggest that combined vaginal probiotics and vitamin D supplementation may improve pregnancy outcomes by modulating the immune responses in women with RIF. This dual intervention may represent a promising strategy for enhancing fertility in this population of RIF patients."

      "abstract": "Cancer has the highest death rates due to increased immuno-oncological (IO) challenges and chemoresistance caused by gut dysbiosis, whereas administration of probiotics may reverse these responses against anticancer therapies. Recently, immunotherapeutics have extensively been focused for significant advancements in pharmacological drug discovery and clinical outcomes. Mammals have intestinal epithelial cells, mucosal immune cells, and indigenous gut microbiota which may reshape immunotherapeutics efficacy. These include use of T-cell immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPI), genetically engineered T-cells, tumor vaccines, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and anti-B- and T-cell antibodies. Immunotherapeutics for cancer treatment became popular in both veterinary and human health care systems due to their strong inhibitory actions against PD-1 and CTLA-4 to check tumorigenesis. IO issues in animals also need special attention, where caninized mAbs targeting CD-20 and CD-52 have been clinically used in treating canine B-cell and T-cell lymphomas, respectively. Probiotics appeared as strong immunotherapeutics that might be shaping the epigenetics of the organisms specifically in animal breeding practices for desired features, but limited literature regarding the immunomodulatory effects in humans and animals is available. In addition, considering the important role of probiotics in humans and veterinary medicine, a new perspective on the probiotic-mediated modulation of ncRNAs (miRNAs, lncRNAs, circRNAs) is also highlighted and would be a new therapeutic tool. This review provides insight into the cellular processes and pharmacological activities for treating veterinary infectious diseases and covers small drug molecules as ncRNA-modulators in veterinary medicine."
