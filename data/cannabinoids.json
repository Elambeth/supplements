      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain, a complex and often devastating condition, poses significant challenges for its effective management. Despite promising research on various cannabis formulations and delivery methods for neuropathic pain, significant gaps remain in our knowledge. While inhaled cannabis shows analgesic effects and alternative delivery methods may improve bioavailability, oral formulations have yielded mixed results, often limited by small sample sizes and placebo effects. Therefore, further research is essential to optimize cannabis formulations, identify responder profiles to tailor treatments effectively, and, most critically, confirm the long-term safety and efficacy of cannabis-based therapies in managing NP. This review article aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the therapeutic potential of cannabis-based medicines, with a particular focus on cannabinoids. This review, though not systematic, examines 11 clinical studies, specifically Randomised Clinical Trials) published from 2014 to 2024, highlighting the efficacy of numerous cannabis formulations, in alleviating neuropathic pain. Key findings show that cannabinoids can reduce pain perception, improve patient quality of life, and mitigate other symptoms associated with neuropathic pain. The synergistic effects of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol are discussed, emphasizing their ability to enhance analgesic effects, while potentially reducing the psychoactive side effects of tetrahydrocannabinol. This review emphasizes the importance of the personalized approach to improve therapeutic outcomes. Limitations of the existing research focusing on cannabis for neuropathic pain are limited by heterogeneity, lack of standardization, small sample sizes, and reliance on subjective outcomes, impacting the reliability and generalizability of findings. However, this exhaustive review aims to inform clinicians and researchers about the evolving role of cannabis in contemporary pain management strategies, illustrating the diverse pharmacological profiles of cannabinoids and their potential as adjunct therapies for neuropathic pain management."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Recently, the endocannabinoid system (ECS) has emerged as a therapeutic target for various inflammatory diseases, including those of the respiratory tract. The objective of this scoping review is to explore the role of the ECS in the pathophysiology of CRS. Moreover, we sought to identify, appraise, and summarize the available evidence for cannabinoids as a potential treatment for CRS. DATA SOURCES: Six databases and four clinical trial registries were searched from inception to February 2025. REVIEW METHODS: All identified studies investigating the role of the ECS in sinonasal inflammatory disease were included for review. RESULTS: A total of 1534 studies were identified in the initial search. Following screening and full-text analysis by three authors, five studies were included in the final scoping review. Four of the studies were preclinical and in vitro in nature, examining the effects of ECS modulation through CB1 and/or CB2 receptors. The findings of each study support a common conclusion that the ECS is implicated in regulating cellular inflammatory pathways potentially involved in sinonasal disease. The final study investigated the effect of marijuana smoking on subjective and objective measures of CRS severity. There were no clinical studies identified investigating the use of cannabinoids for the treatment of sinonasal inflammatory conditions. CONCLUSION: Current literature examining the role of ECS in sinonasal inflammatory disease is highly limited, though it indicates ECS may play a role in the complex pathophysiology of sinonasal inflammatory disease. Further work is warranted to assess ECS as a potential therapeutic target for CRS."

      "abstract": "Rhabdomyolysis is a life-threatening complication and is sometimes, though rarely, induced by the use of synthetic cannabinoids. The pathophysiology is poorly understood. However, the effect is through the activation of G-protein coupled receptors. We discuss the case of a 48-year-old man who was a known case of muscle-invasive bladder cancer and received four cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. An X-ray showed an interval decrease in urinary bladder wall size and pelvic lymph nodes. He underwent radical cystoprostatectomy with lymph node dissection and an orthotopic new bladder. Postoperatively, the patient developed severe back pain, reduced lower limb function, and shortness of breath. Laboratory investigations revealed elevated creatinine and creatine kinase levels and decreased urine output. The diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis was made. Accordingly, the patient required continuous renal replacement therapy and was then shifted to hemodialysis. There are limited data available mentioning the effect of synthetic cannabinoids in the development of rhabdomyolysis. Our study emphasizes the importance of understanding the effects of synthetic cannabinoid toxicity in the development of rhabdomyolysis as well as of educating physicians and pharmacists in establishing better therapeutic and protective measures for satisfactory outcomes and minimizing the risk of mortality if left untreated."

      "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) lacks an established pharmacological treatment protocol, prompting interest in alternative therapeutic approaches, such as cannabidiol (CBD). This systematic review evaluates the potential efficacy and safety of CBD-rich formulations in managing ASD symptoms. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library identified seven studies encompassing 494 patients from Brazil and Israel. Preliminary findings suggest that CBD-rich formulations may provide modest benefits for sleep and social interaction, with a reduction in anxiety symptoms. Regarding core ASD symptoms and behavioral outcomes, cannabinoids demonstrated greater efficacy compared to placebo in some studies. However, adverse events varied, and response to treatment was inconsistent across individuals. While cannabinoids, particularly CBD-rich formulations, appear to be relatively safe and potentially beneficial, further large-scale, controlled trials comparing CBD to established ASD treatments are essential to clarify its role and long-term impact in ASD management."

      "abstract": "The beneficial effects of cannabinoids in the treatment of respiratory diseases have been drawing researchers' attention for several decades. Asthma is a complex disease entity characterized by a variable course, the treatment of which requires the continuous search for alternative, adjuvant treatment strategies designed for patients refractory to available pharmacotherapies. Cannabinoids exert certain physiological responses in the respiratory system due to their immunomodulatory properties and the strong presence of the endocannabinoid system in the lungs. In animal model studies, THC and CBD seem to counteract bronchoconstriction and inhibit pro-inflammatory mediation, respectively, which highlights their possible future contribution to the treatment of respiratory and allergic diseases, such as asthma. However, there are controversies regarding the health consequences of cannabis usage, the extracts' proportions, or equally safe and effective routes of administration, especially considering the alarming reports indicating an increased risk of asthma development among recreational cannabis smokers. The purpose of this review is to analyze the available literature on the influence of the endocannabinoid system, phytocannabinoids, and their modes of action on asthma pathogenesis in an attempt to assess their potential clinical relevance and determine future research directions.",

      "abstract": "Diseases of multifactorial origin like neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases require a multitargeted approach. The discovery of the role of autoimmunity in glaucoma and retinal ganglionic cell (RGC) death has led to a paradigm shift in our understanding of the etiopathology of glaucoma. Glaucoma can cause irreversible vision loss that affects up to an estimated 3% of the population over 40 years of age. The current pharmacotherapy primarily aims to manage only intraocular pressure (IOP), a modifiable risk factor in the glaucomatous neurodegeneration of RGCs. However, neurodegeneration continues to happen in normotensive patients (where the IOP is below a reference value), and the silent nature of the disease can cause significant visual impairment and take a massive toll on the healthcare system. Cannabinoids, although known to reduce IOP since the 1970s, have received renewed interest due to their neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and immunosuppressive effects on autoimmunity. Additionally, the role of the gut-retina axis and abnormal Wnt signaling in glaucoma makes cannabinoids even more relevant because of their action on multiple targets, all converging in the pathogenesis of glaucomatous neurodegeneration. Cannabinoids also cause epigenetic changes in immune cells associated with autoimmunity. In this Review, we are proposing the use of cannabinoids as a multitargeted approach for treating autoimmunity associated with glaucomatous neurodegeneration, especially for the silent nature of glaucomatous neurodegeneration in normotensive patients."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cannabis use is common in people with and mood and anxiety disorders (ADs), and rates of problematic use are higher than in the general population. Given recent policy changes in favor of cannabis legalization, it is important to understand how cannabis and cannabinoids may impact people with these disorders. We aimed to assess the effects of cannabis on the onset and course of depression, bipolar disorder, ADs, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and also to explore the therapeutic potential of cannabis and cannabinoids for these disorders. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was completed. The PubMed® database from January 1990 to May 2018 was searched. We included longitudinal cohort studies, and also all studies using cannabis or a cannabinoid as an active intervention, regardless of the study design. RESULTS: Forty-seven studies were included: 32 reported on illness onset, nine on illness course, and six on cannabinoid therapeutics. Cohort studies varied significantly in design and quality. The literature suggests that cannabis use is linked to the onset and poorer clinical course in bipolar disorder and PTSD, but this finding is not as clear in depression and anxiety disorders (ADs). There have been few high-quality studies of cannabinoid pharmaceuticals in clinical settings. CONCLUSIONS AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: These conclusions are limited by a lack of well-controlled longitudinal studies. We suggest that future research be directed toward high-quality, prospective studies of cannabis in clinical populations with mood and ADs, in addition to controlled studies of cannabinoid constituents and pharmaceuticals in these populations.Reprinted from Am J Addict 2020; 29:9-26, with permission from American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry.

      "abstract": "Cannabinoids have attracted increasing attention in cancer research in recent decades. A major focus of current preclinical and clinical studies is on the interactions and potential risks when combined with chemotherapeutic agents, targeted therapies and other anticancer strategies. Given the extensive preclinical data on additive, synergistic and, in some cases, antagonistic tumor cell killing effects of chemotherapeutic agents and cannabinoids when co-administered, a critical analysis of these data seems essential. The available data mainly relate to combination treatments for glioblastoma, hematological malignancies and breast cancer, but also for other cancer types. Such an analysis also appears necessary because cannabinoids are used as an option to treat nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy, as well as tumor-related pain, and cancer patients sometimes take cannabinoids without a medical prescription. In addition, numerous recent preclinical studies also suggest cannabinoid-mediated relief of other chemotherapy-related side effects such as peripheral neuropathy, nephrotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, cystitis, bladder complications and mucositis. To summarize, the data available to date raise the prospect that cannabinoids may increase the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents while reducing their side effects. However, preclinical studies on anticancer interactions are mostly limited to cytotoxicity analyses. An equally thorough investigation of the effects of such combinations on the immune system and on the tumorigenic levels of angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis is still pending. On this basis, a comprehensive understanding for the evaluation of a targeted additional treatment of various cancers with cannabinoids could be established."

ICIs block cancer and T-cell interactions whereas cannabinoids may inhibit T-cell activation, reducing lysis of tumor cells. Interactions between cannabinoid use and dual ICI treatment remain unknown. METHODS: Individual patient data from 4 Canadian Cancer Trials Group (CCTG) trials of patients treated with dual ICI ± chemotherapy (n = 684) were pooled. Cochran - Mantel - Haenszel and log-rank tests (stratified by trial/treatment arms) correlated cannabinoid use with clinicopathologic characteristics, Best Overall Response (BOR)/iBOR per RECIST 1.1/iRECIST, Progression-Free Survival (PFS)/iPFS, Overall Survival (OS) and immune-related adverse events (irAEs). RESULTS: Sixty-five (9.5%) patients took cannabinoids at any time on trial, 32 (4.7%) of which were using cannabinoids at baseline. By multivariate analysis, cannabinoid use at baseline was significantly associated with improved iPFS (0.05), but not iBOR (p = 0.15), PFS (p = 0.12), OS (p = 0.35) or incidence of grade 1/2 or 3/4 irAEs (p = 0.96 and 0.65 respectively). Results were not significantly different with cannabinoid use at any time on trial. CONCLUSION: Improved iPFS with cannabinoid use in patients treated with durvalumab plus tremelimumab ± chemotherapy did not translate into OS benefits.

The current study aimed to compare children and adults with acute natural cannabinoids toxicity and highlight cases with acute synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) toxicity. This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on patients with acute cannabinoids toxicity admitted to Tanta University Poison Control Center from January 2019 to December 2023. Socio-demographic, toxicological, clinical, and laboratory data were retrieved from patients' medical records. Patients were divided into a pediatric group (≤ 18 years) and an adult group (> 18 years). Out of 106 patients, 68 were children and 38 were adults. Impaired consciousness level and bradypnea were more significantly reported in children (P < 0.001, 0.007, respectively). Low oxygen saturation, tachycardia, hypokalemia, and leukocytosis were more significantly reported in adults (P < 0.001, for each). Delay time from exposure to medical intervention and potassium level were significantly valid to predict complications in children (Adjusted odds ratio: 1.393 and 4.139, respectively). Delay time to medical intervention and oxygen saturation were significant risk factors for prolonged hospital stay in children (Adjusted odds ratio: 1.255 and 0.677, respectively). Acute SCs toxicity was observed only in four cases presented mainly with seizures, tachycardia, hypertension, tachypnea, and hypoxemia. It could be concluded that natural cannabinoids toxicity is more prevalent than SCs. Presentation of acute natural cannabinoids toxicity exhibits variations between children and adults. Delay time to medical intervention, as well as potassium and oxygen saturation levels are significant risk factors for complications and prolonged hospitalization in children."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cannabinoids have gained attention as a potential treatment for headache disorders, including migraine and cluster headache. While some studies suggest cannabinoids may provide analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects, concerns remain regarding their potential for overuse headache, cognitive impairment, and psychological dependence. This study critically evaluates the current evidence on cannabinoids in headache treatment, weighing their benefits and risks. RECENT FINDINGS: With the migraine treatment landscape expanding faster than ever, recent studies explore immune cells as a target for cannabinoids. Immune cells express cannabinoid and CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) receptors. As a result, cannabinoids might potentially modulate the efficacy of current CGRP-targeting drugs. Additionally, emerging studies suggest that cannabinoids may enhance neuronal resilience and mitigate central sensitization in chronic migraine. Research into optimal delivery mechanisms, including inhaled, sublingual, and transdermal formulations, is also expanding. SUMMARY: Cannabinoids are being studied as a potential treatment for headache disorders, particularly migraine, due to their interaction with the endocannabinoid system, which regulates pain, inflammation, and vascular function. Studies suggest cannabinoids may help reduce headache frequency, alleviate pain, and improve sleep, though concerns remain about dependency, cognitive impairment, and medication overuse headache. While retrospective studies indicate benefits, the lack of standardized dosing, long-term safety data, and controlled trials limits conclusive recommendations. Comparisons with conventional treatments show mixed results, with cannabinoids presenting variable effectiveness and a risk of adverse effects. Further research, including randomized controlled trials, is needed to establish optimal dosing, safety, and efficacy in headache management."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Chronic pain remains a pervasive and challenging public health issue, often resistant to conventional treatments such as opioids, which carry substantial risks of dependency and adverse effects. Cannabinoids, bioactive compounds derived from the Cannabis sativa plant and their synthetic analogs, have emerged as a potential alternative for pain management, leveraging their interaction with the endocannabinoid system to modulate pain and inflammation. Methods: The current, evolving literature regarding the history, efficacy, applications, and safety of cannabinoids in the treatment of chronic pain was reviewed and summarized to provide the most current review of cannabinoids. Results: Evidence suggests that cannabinoids provide moderate efficacy in managing neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, cancer-related pain, and multiple sclerosis-related spasticity. Patient-reported outcomes further indicate widespread perceptions of cannabinoids as a safer alternative to opioids, with potential opioid-sparing effects. However, the quality of existing evidence is limited by small sample sizes and methodological inconsistencies. Regulatory barriers, including the classification of cannabis as a Schedule I substance in the United States, continue to hinder robust research and clinical integration. Moreover, the risks associated with cannabinoids, such as psychiatric effects, addiction potential, and drug interactions, necessitate cautious application. Conclusions: Cannabinoids represent a promising, albeit complex, alternative for chronic pain management, particularly given the limitations and risks of traditional therapies such as opioids. However, significant deficiencies remain in the research. While smaller trials and systematic reviews indicate therapeutic potential, the quality of evidence is often low due to limited sample sizes, short study durations, and methodological inconsistencies. Large-scale, randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up are urgently needed to confirm efficacy and safety across diverse patient populations and pain etiologies."

      "abstract": "Cannabinoids relieve pain, nausea, anorexia and anxiety, and improve quality of life in several cancer patients. The immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), although very successful in a subset of patients, is accompanied by moderate to severe immune-related adverse events (ir-AE) that often necessitate its discontinuation. Because of their role in symptomatic relief, cannabinoids have been used in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) immunotherapy. A few studies strongly suggest that the use of medicinal cannabis in cancer patients attenuates many of the ir-AE associated with the use of ICI immunotherapy and increase its tolerability. However, no significant beneficial effects on overall survival, progression free survival or cancer relapses were observed; rather, some of the studies noted adverse effects of concurrent administration of cannabinoids with ICI immunotherapy on the clinical benefits of the latter. Because of cannabinoids' well documented immunosuppressive effects mediated through the cannabinoid recptor-2 (CB2), we propose considering this receptor as an inhibitory immune checkpoint per se. A simultaneous neutralization of CB2, concurrent with cannabinoid treatment, may lead to better clinical outcomes in cancer patients receiving ICI immunotherapy. In this regard, cannabinoids such as cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabigerol (CBG), with little agonism for CB2, may be better therapeutic choices. Additional strategies e.g., the use of monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibitors that degrade some endocannabinoids as well as lipogenesis and formation of lipid bilayers in cancer cells may also be explored. Future studies should take into consideration gut microbiota, CYP450 polymorphism and haplotypes, cannabinoid-drug interactions as well as genetic and somatic variations occurring in the cannabinoid receptors and their signaling pathways in cancer cells for personalized cannabis-based therapies in cancer patients receiving ICIs. This may lead to rational knowledge-based regimens tailored to individual cancer patients.",

      "abstract": "Elevating nutrient input is thought to increase yield and cannabinoid concentration of medical cannabis, but increased legalization has heightened awareness of the environmental impact of overfertilization. Elevated levels of phosphorus (P) are of particular concern. Here we report the effects of increasing P above levels adequate for other crops (15, 30, 45, 60, or 90 mg per L) and the interactive effects of elevated P with elevated nutrient solution concentration (electrical conductivity; 2 and 4 mS per cm). We used closed-system hydroponics to continuously quantify rootzone nutrient concentrations. The concentration of P in leaf tissue doubled and flower P concentration increased 70% when the P input increased from 15 to 90 mg per L but there was no difference in yield or quality among treatments. Doubling nutrient input from 2 to 4 mS per cm increased nutrient accumulation in solution but did not significantly increase yield or quality. Reducing P in the refill solution from 90 to 15 mg per L reduced P in solution at harvest from 300 to less than 0.1 mg per L. Despite the low steady-state concentration of P in solution in the 15 mg per L treatment, there was no difference in yield or quality among treatments, regardless of the concentration of other elements. Despite the high nutrient concentrations in the rootzone solution there was no leaf necrosis or other visual effects among treatments. These data indicate cannabis tolerates high nutrient concentrations, but neither excessive P nor excessive fertilization improves yield or quality."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Our objective was to provide an overview of the currently available scientific and clinical data supporting the use of Cannabis and Cannabis-derived products for the treatment of chronic pain disorders. We also provide information for researchers, clinicians, and patients to be better informed and understand the approach behind the recommendation of Cannabis as a potential adjuvant in the treatment/control of chronic pain. Cannabis and its bioactive compounds have sparked interest in the field of pain treatment in spite of its controversial history and status as a controlled substance in many countries. With the increase in chronic pain, physicians and patients have started to look at alternative ways to treat pain aside from traditional treatments. One alternative is the use of cannabis to reduce/treat chronic pain disorders based on anecdotal accounts and the function of its phytocannabinoids. The two main cannabinoids in cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol, act on CB1 and CB2 receptors (in addition to several additional receptors). It is through these pleiotropic receptor interactions that these compounds elicit their biological function including the reduction of chronic pain. In this narrative review, we included the most recent evidence supporting the use of cannabis in the treatment of chronic pain disorders including chronic neuropathic pain, cancer-induced neuropathic pain, chronic musculoskeletal pain, and chronic headaches and migraines. SUMMARY: Evidence suggests that cannabis and cannabinoids have an analgesic effect that arises from a combination of compounds and various receptor systems. These effects may be maximized with the use of a combination of cannabinoids. At the same time, the combination of cannabinoids helps minimize the undesirable side effects of some cannabinoids such as the psychoactivity of THC. With these findings, further research is necessary to assess the analgesic properties of other cannabinoids like cannabichromene and cannabigerol and their contributions to the reduction of pain. KEY MESSAGES: Cannabis and its bioactive compounds show potential in the reduction of chronic pain."

      "abstract": "Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a transmembrane receptor within the ErbB family that plays a pivotal role in the progression of various aggressive cancers. HER2-positive tumors often develop resistance to standard therapies, necessitating the exploration of innovative treatment options. Cannabinoids, bioactive compounds from Cannabis sativa such as cannabidiol (CBD), cannabigerol (CBG), and cannabinol (CBN), have gained attention for their potential anticancer properties. This study evaluates the efficacy of CBD, CBG, and CBN in targeting HER2-positive ovarian cancer through kinase inhibition assays, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), molecular docking, and cell viability assessments. SPR analysis revealed that cannabinoids bind strongly to HER2-tyrosine kinase (HER2-TK), with CBD showing the highest affinity (K D = 6.16 μM), significantly better than afatinib (K D = 26.30 μM), and CBG demonstrating moderate affinity (K D = 17.07 μM). In kinase inhibition assays, CBG was the most potent inhibitor (IC50 = 24.7 nM), followed by CBD (IC50 = 38 nM), suggesting their ability to disrupt HER2-mediated signaling pathways. Molecular docking studies highlighted critical interactions between cannabinoids and essential HER2 residues (Leu796, Thr862, Asp863). In cell viability assays, CBD and CBG effectively inhibited the growth of HER2-positive SKOV3 cells (IC50 = 13.8 μM and 16.6 μM, respectively), comparable to traditional tyrosine kinase inhibitors. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids, particularly CBD and CBG, as alternative or adjunct therapies for HER2-positive cancers, with the promise of mitigating resistance and adverse effects associated with existing treatments."

This review aims to assess the current clinical trials investigating cannabinoids, primarily Tetrahydrocannabinol and Cannabidiol, for neurological disorders. This review will aim to highlight the efficacy, safety, and outcome measures used in these trials. METHODS: Clinical trials were identified using ClinicalTrials.gov, focusing on studies that examined the effects of cannabinoids in treating neurological conditions. All trials that fulfilled the following criteria were included: Phase 1-4, focused on cannabinoids as primary intervention, and measured relevant outcomes such as pain relief, cognitive function, or spasticity reduction. Data on conditions, interventions, primary and secondary outcomes, and trial phases were extracted and analysed. RESULTS: A total of 47 clinical trials were identified, including different neurological conditions. The most frequently studied conditions were Multiple Sclerosis, Fibromyalgia, and Parkinson's Disease. Most trials were in Phase 2, with the primary outcome measures focused on pain management, spasticity, and cognitive function. Secondary outcomes included safety and tolerability measures. CONCLUSION: The review highlights the broad therapeutic potential of cannabinoids in neurology, with promising results in symptom management for conditions like Multiple Sclerosis and Fibromyalgia. However, the lack of standardized study protocols, dosing, and outcome measures presents challenges for broader clinical implementation. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: clinicatrials.gov."

The aim is to identify distinct outcomes of co-exposure compared to single-drug exposures and to examine potential sex-specific vulnerabilities in motor coordination and exploratory behaviors. Pregnant C57Bl/6J mice were assigned to one of four treatment groups: Control, Alcohol-exposed, Cannabinoid-exposed, or Alcohol+Cannabinoid-exposed, with drug administration occurring between Gestational Days 12-15. Offspring were first evaluated at birth for survival, physical malformations, and developmental delays. Subsequently, young adult offspring were assessed for motor coordination using rotarod tests and exploratory behavior using open field tests. Our results indicate that alcohol and cannabinoid co-exposure significantly reduced offspring survival and litter sizes compared to controls. Non-viable offspring displayed craniofacial abnormalities, limb malformations, and developmental delays. Behavioral assessments in young adulthood demonstrated that all forms of prenatal drug exposure impaired motor coordination in males, while alcohol and cannabinoid exposures independently produced impairments in females. In the open field test, co-exposed male offspring exhibited reduced center exploration, indicative of anxiety-like behavior. Co-exposed offspring, regardless of sex, demonstrated hyperactivity, characterized by increased speed and distance traveled. Together, these findings underscore the heightened risks associated with prenatal polysubstance exposure, which exacerbates offspring mortality and induces sex-specific neurobehavioral deficits. This study highlights the distinct outcomes associated with prenatal co-exposure, and the need for future research to investigate underlying mechanisms driving these developmental disruptions and sex-specific susceptibilities."

      "abstract": "Introduction: The endocannabinoid system plays a crucial role in gastrointestinal homeostasis; although some gastrointestinal adverse events have been reported with therapeutic cannabinoids in children, the complete profile of gastrointestinal adverse events in the pediatric population remains unknown. Through a systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to identify the prevalence of gastrointestinal adverse events from therapeutic cannabinoids in children. Materials and Methods: A literature search of OVID MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library was performed from inception to May 19, 2023. Selected studies included randomized controlled trials, retrospective cohort studies, uncontrolled before-after studies, and observational retrospective studies in English, French, or Spanish that reported gastrointestinal adverse events in the pediatric population under therapeutic cannabinoid interventions. The study was registered with PROSPERO and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guidelines. A random-effects model was used to pool and analyze the extracted data. Extracted data included the presence of adverse gastrointestinal events by analyzing the type of cannabinoid, duration of treatment, dosage, and type of study. A subgroup meta-analysis was also performed, focusing on patients' conditions. Results: Twenty-five studies were included, comprising 1,201 pediatric patients receiving therapeutic cannabinoids, of whom 451 experienced gastrointestinal adverse events, representing a cumulative prevalence of 33.91% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 21.49% to 49.04%). Interventional studies reported a higher prevalence of GI adverse events (47.36%; 95% CI: 31% to 64%) compared with observational studies (17.6%; 95% CI: 8.5% to 32.7%). As most studies focused on patients with epilepsy, a subanalysis was performed within this population, revealing that patients with Dravet syndrome had a higher prevalence of diarrhea compared with other types of epilepsy (21.75%; 95% CI: 8.52% to 45.34% vs. 5.95%; 95% CI: 3.11% to 11.1%). Discussion: This systematic review and meta-analysis showed a high prevalence of gastrointestinal adverse events in children receiving therapeutic cannabinoids, with some populations, such as those with Dravet syndrome, being at higher risk than others. With the increased public discourse of cannabinoids being \"natural\" and mistakenly equating them as \"risk-free,\" this information can help clinicians educate patients and the broader public on the adverse effects profile of these treatments."

The aim of this meta-analysis is to examine the relative efficacy of cannabinoids for prophylaxis of CINV. METHODS: A literature search was conducted in OVID Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception up until March 2024. Articles were included if they reported on complete response, no nausea, no vomiting or no use of rescue medications, and were randomized controlled trials with cannabinoids in one arm. Meta-analysis was conducted for each endpoint and for a composite endpoint amalgamating existing endpoints. Subgroup analyses by medication used in control arm and by study design were conducted. Cumulative and leave-one-out analysis was also conducted. Type I error was set at 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 26 studies were included in this meta-analysis, of which 23 were published before the 2000s. Nearly half of the included studies had some concern for bias. Cannabinoid had superior overall CINV control compared to placebo (RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.70-4.12, I2 = 0.00%). However, there was no difference between cannabinoid and active treatment alternatives (most using dated single-agent regimens) for any outcomes. A recent phase II/III trial demonstrated superior efficacy of THC:CBD for secondary prevention of CINV when used as adjunctive therapy alongside modern antiemetic regimens, albeit mostly without olanzapine. CONCLUSIONS: There is scant evidence for efficacy of cannabinoids for CINV in the era of triple and quadruple antiemetics. Although THC:CBD showed promised in a recent trial, further trials should examine its safety and efficacy in the context of regimens containing olanzapine.",

      "abstract": "A unifying mechanistic cause for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains uncertain. Multiple pathophysiological processes appear to occur simultaneously. Cannabinoids, including delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), cannabigerol (CBG), and others found in cannabis, and cannabis extracts (CEs), appear to have activity in these pathogenic pathways, which have led to increasing interest in cannabinoids as therapeutic agents for ALS. The use of cannabinoids as a treatment strategy is substantiated by preclinical evidence suggesting a role for the endocannabinoid system (ECS) in ALS and other neurodegenerative disorders. Preclinical data indicate that cannabis and CEs have powerful antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects in the SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS. The use of CEs in SOD1G93A murine models has been shown to prolong neuronal cell survival, which leads to delayed onset of the disease state, and slows progression of the disease. Although research in humans remains limited, a few studies suggest that cannabis and CBD, in humans, provide benefits for both motor symptoms, including rigidity, cramps, and fasciculations, and non-motor symptoms including sleep quality, pain, emotional state, quality of life, and depression. There remains a need for further, well-designed clinical trials to validate further the use of an individual cannabinoid, or a combination of cannabinoids, as a disease-modifying therapy for ALS."

      "abstract": "Abdominal pain is the most disabling symptom of inflammatory bowel diseases, but current treatments are limited, leading patients to seek alternatives such as cannabis. Cannabis contains over 100 cannabinoids which, unlike tetrahydrocannabinol, are biologically active compounds often without psychotropic effects (ie, nonpsychotropic cannabinoids [npCBs]). These npCBs have analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties and may show potentiating effects when administered in combination, referred to as the entourage effect. Here, we investigated the analgesic effects of cannabichromene, cannabidiol (CBD), cannabidivarin, and cannabigerol (CBG), individually and in combination, using the mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium colitis-induced visceral hypersensitivity (VHS). We then explored antinociceptive targets through patch-clamp electrophysiology on dorsal root ganglia neurons and recombinant channels. We found that a single injection of 10 mg/kg of either CBD or CBG reduced both VHS and c-Fos activation in the spinal dorsal horn. Moreover, a combination of npCBs consisting of 5 mg/kg CBD with 1 mg/kg of cannabichromene, cannabidivarin, and CBG-all at subtherapeutic dosages-reduced VHS, without altering colitis. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that the antinociceptive mixture of npCBs acts through voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels, particularly Cav2.2, but not Cav3.2 and Kv channels. These results suggest that CBD, CBG, and a mixture of npCBs given at subtherapeutic doses may be beneficial in managing VHS associated with inflammatory bowel disease. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Cannabis is increasingly used as an alternative treatment for managing pain associated with chronic conditions. Nonpsychotropic cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol, interact with ionotropic and voltage-gated ion channels. In our study, we demonstrated that cannabidiol, cannabigerol, and a combination of nonpsychotropic cannabinoids, administered at subtherapeutic doses, effectively alleviated visceral hypersensitivity associated with inflammatory bowel disease.",

      "abstract": "Stroke represents a significant burden on global health and the economy, with high mortality rates, disability, and recurrence. Ischemic stroke is a serious condition that occurs when a blood vessel in the brain is interrupted, reducing the blood supply to the affected area. Inflammation is a significant component in stroke pathophysiology. Neuroinflammation is triggered following the acute ischemic ictus, where the blood-brain barrier (BBB) breaks down, causing damage to the endothelial cells. The damage will eventually generate oxidative stress, activate the pathological phenotypes of astrocytes and microglia, and lead to neuronal death in the neurovascular unit. As a result, the brain unleashes a robust neuroinflammatory response, which can further worsen the neurological outcomes. Neuroinflammation is a complex pathological process involved in ischemic damage and repair. Finding new neuroinflammation molecular targets is essential to develop effective and safe novel treatment approaches against ischemic stroke. Accumulating studies have investigated the pharmacological properties of cannabinoids (CBs) for many years, and recent research has shown their potential therapeutic use in treating ischemic stroke in rodent models. These findings revealed promising impacts of CBs in reducing neuroinflammation and cellular death and ameliorating neurological deficits. In this review, we explore the possibility of the therapeutic administration of CBs in mitigating neuroinflammation caused by a stroke. We summarize the results from several preclinical studies evaluating the efficacy of CBs anti-inflammatory interventions in ischemic stroke. Although convincing preclinical evidence implies that CBs targeting neuroinflammation are promising for ischemic stroke, translating these findings into the clinical setting has proven to be challenging. The translation hurdle is due to the essence of the CBs ability to cause anxiety, cognitive deficit, and psychosis. Future studies are warranted to address the dose-beneficial effect of CBs in clinical trials of ischemic stroke-related neuroinflammation treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Poor acute postoperative pain control, coupled with the use of intravenous medications with a limited and unsafety efficacy spectrum, has led to new therapeutic alternative explorations to reduce adverse events while increasing its analgesic efficacy. There cannabinoids have been proposed as a useful control agent in post-surgical pain. Nevertheless, to date, there is no solid evidence to evaluate them. The current article sought to determine cannabinoids' effectiveness and safety in the aforementioned context. METHODS: A systematic review of controlled clinical trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of cannabinoids for the treatment of acute postoperative pain. The study was structured under the Cochrane recommendations. Primary outcomes included: pain intensity reduction, the number and doses of rescue analgesics and adverse events. RESULTS: Of 62 articles found, only five were included. Four of them presented high inter-observer agreement and 60% were classified as having a low risk of bias. When evaluating the objectives of each article, a disparity was found in the investigative methods and terms implemented. Due to the heterogeneity of methods, it was not possible to carry out meta-analytic evaluations and only qualitative evaluations were feasible. CONCLUSIONS: Despite finding contradictory evidence in relation to the analgesic cannabis effect in the postoperative context, methodological disparities found in the included articles and the impossibility of performing collective quantitative analyses were more significant. Before concluding with the well-known sentence: \"further intervention studies are necessary\", this report has identified limitations and has proposed recommendations for the planning and execution of future cannabis clinical trials, which will support new and necessary evidence for stronger meta-analytic reviews. SIGNIFICANCE: The management of severe pain after surgery, and the use of intravenous drugs with limited and potentially unsafe effectiveness, has led to the exploration of new treatment options to minimize side effects while improving pain relief. Cannabinoids have been suggested as a potential solution for managing post-surgical pain, but there is currently insufficient evidence to assess their effectiveness. The purpose of this article was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of cannabinoids in this context.",

      "abstract": "Both hydrogen sulfide and endocannabinoids can protect the neural retina from toxic insults under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Purpose: The aim of the present study was two-fold: (a) to examine the neuroprotective action of cannabinoids [methanandamide and 2-arachidonyl glycerol (2-AG)] against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative damage in the isolated bovine retina and (b) to evaluate the role of endogenously biosynthesized hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the inhibitory actions of cannabinoids on the oxidative stress in the bovine retina. Methods: Isolated neural retinas from cows were exposed to oxidative damage using H2O2 (100 µM) for 10 min. When used, tissues were pretreated with methanandamide (1 nM-100 nM) and 2-AG (1-10 µM) for 30 min before a 10 min treatment with H2O2 (100 µM). In some experiments, retinas were pretreated with inhibitors of the biosynthesis of H2S [cystathionine β-synthase/cystathionine γ-lyase (CBS/CSE), aminooxyacetic acid, AOAA 30 µM, or 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST), α-keto-butyric acid, KBA 1 mM] and the CB1-receptor antagonist, AM251 (100 nM) for 30 min before treatment with methanandamide (1 nM-100 µM). Enzyme immunoassay measurement of 8-epi PGF2α (8-isoprostane) levels was performed to assess lipid peroxidation in retinal tissues. Results: In the presence of H2O2 (100 µM), methanandamide (1 nM-100 µM) and 2-AG (1-10 µM) significantly (p < 0.001) blocked the H2O2-induced elevation in 8-isoprostane levels in the isolated bovine retina. In the presence of the CB1 antagonist AM251 (100 nM), the effect of methanandamide (1 nM) on the H2O2-induced 8-isoprostane production was significantly (p < 0.001) attenuated. While AOAA (30 µM) had no significant (p > 0.05) effect on the inhibition of H2O2-induced oxidative stress elicited by methanandamide, KBA (1 mM) reversed the neuroprotective action of methanandamide. Conclusions: The cannabinoids, methanandamide and 2-AG can prevent H2O2-induced oxidative stress in the isolated bovine retina. The neuroprotective actions of cannabinoids are partially dependent upon the activation of the CB1 receptors and endogenous production of H2S via the 3-MST/CAT pathway."

      "abstract": "There has been a global increase in the use of cannabinoids as a treatment for mental health (MH) and substance use disorders (SUD). In 2016, an Australian government-funded review found that although medicinal cannabinoids accounted for a small reduction in MH symptoms, the results varied according to study design. There has since been a rise in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) aiming to examine the efficacy of cannabinoids for the treatment of MH and SUD. Therefore, the current systematic review will (a) identify all RCTs examining the efficacy of cannabinoids in treating MH and SUD, (b) provide a quantitative or narrative synthesis of the evidence examining efficacy, and (c) synthesise adverse event data to examine evidence of harm. Electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Embase) were searched from 1980 to 24 May 2023. The study adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Guidelines. Articles will be screened to capture peer-reviewed RCTs evaluating the efficacy of plant-based and pharmaceutical cannabinoids in reducing or treating MH and SUD among people of any age. The Cochrane risk of bias tool 2.0 will be used to assess bias, while the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool will be used to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome. Study findings will be disseminated through published manuscripts, conferences, and health policy guidelines.Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD42023392718.",

      "abstract": "Metastasizing cancer cells surreptitiously can adapt to metabolic activity during their invasion. By initiating their communications for invasion, cancer cells can reprogram their cellular activities to initiate their proliferation and migration and uniquely counteract metabolic stress during their progression. During this reprogramming process, cancer cells' metabolism and other cellular activities are integrated and mutually regulated by tunneling nanotube communications to alter their specific metabolic functional drivers of tumor growth and progression. Here, we investigated the in vitro effects of the synthetic CB1 cannabinoids AM-404, arvanil, and olvanil on human pancreatic PANC-1 and colorectal SW-620 cancer cell lines to understand further cellular behaviors and the potential risks of their use in cancer therapy. For the first time, the synthetic CB1 cannabinoids AM-404, arvanil, and olvanil significantly altered cancer cells in forming missile-like shapes to induce tunneling nanotube (TNT) communications in PANC-1 cells. Oseltamivir phosphate (OP) significantly prevented TNT formation. To assess the key survival pathways critical for pancreatic cancer progression, we used the AlamarBlue assay to determine synthetic CB1 cannabinoids to induce the cell's metabolic viability drivers to stage migratory intercellular communication. The synthetic CB1 cannabinoids significantly increased cell viability compared to the untreated control for PANC-1 and SW-620 cells, and this response was significantly reduced with the NMBR inhibitor BIM-23127, neuraminidase-1 inhibitor OP, and MMP-9 inhibitor (MMP-9i). CB1 cannabinoids also significantly increased N-cadherin and decreased E-cadherin EMT markers compared to the untreated controls, inducing the process of metastatic phenotype for invasion. BIM-23127, MMP9i, and OP significantly inhibited CB1 agonist-induced NFκB-dependent secretory alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) activity. To confirm this concept, we investigated the migratory invasiveness of PANC-1 and SW-620 cancer cells treated with the synthetic CB1 cannabinoids AM-404, arvanil, and olvanil in a scratch wound assay. CB1 cannabinoids significantly induced the rate of migration and invasiveness of PANC-1 cancer cells, whereas they had minimal effect on the rate of migration of already metastatic SW-620 cancer cells. Interestingly, olvanil-treated SW-620 cells significantly enhanced the migration rate and invasiveness of these cells. The data support the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the synthetic CB1 cannabinoids, orchestrating intercellular conduits to enhance metabolic drivers to stage migratory intercellular communication in pancreatic cancer cells.",

      "abstract": "Our recently developed approach based on the local coupled-cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitation [LCCSD(T)] model gives very efficient means to compute the ideal-gas enthalpies of formation. The expanded uncertainty (95% confidence) of the method is about 3 kJ·mol-1 for medium-sized compounds, comparable to typical experimental measurements. Larger compounds of interest often exhibit many conformations that can significantly differ in intramolecular interactions. Although the present capabilities allow processing even a few hundred distinct conformer structures for a given compound, many systems of interest exhibit numbers well in excess of 1000. In this study, we investigate how to reduce the number of expensive LCCSD(T) calculations for large conformer ensembles while controlling the error of the approximation. The best strategy found was to correct the results of the lower-level, surrogate model (density functional theory, DFT) in a systematic manner. It was also found that the error in the conformational contribution introduced by a surrogate model is mainly driven by a systematic (bias) rather than a random component of the DFT energy deviation from the LCCSD(T) target. This distinction is usually overlooked in DFT benchmarking studies. As a result of this work, the enthalpies of formation for 20 cannabinoid and cannabinoid-related compounds were obtained. Comprehensive uncertainty analysis suggests that the expanded uncertainties of the obtained values are below 4 kJ·mol-1."

      "abstract": "Chronic pain lasting more than three months or persisting after normal healing is a significant global health issue. In a healthcare system, it is crucial to ensure proper chronic pain management. Traditional pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain management techniques may not fully meet the requirements of physicians regarding effectiveness and safety. Therefore, researchers are exploring natural analgesics. Plant-based phytoconstituents show promise in relieving chronic pain associated with various diseases. This study aims to review the latest advances in discovering natural bioactive compounds that can help alleviate chronic pain. It discusses the pathways of chronic pain and a multifactorial treatment strategy. It also organizes data on using plant- derived substances, such as cannabinoids, terpenoids, phenolics, and crude extracts. Additionally, it delves into the pharmacodynamics of cannabinoids, including their route of administration and elimination. The review presents the results of 22 clinical trials on various cannabinoids for pain relief. It is important to note that opioids and other alkaloids from plants are not covered in this article due to their primary use in controlling acute rather than chronic pain."

Few properly controlled clinical trials have evaluated the potential of exogenously administered cannabinoids or manipulations of the endogenous cannabinoid (eCB) system to treat nausea and vomiting. In this chapter, we explore the pre-clinical and human clinical trial evidence for the potential of exogenous cannabinoids and manipulations of the eCB system to reduce nausea and vomiting. Although there are limited high-quality human clinical trials, pre-clinical evidence suggests that cannabinoids and manipulations of the eCB system have anti-nausea/anti-emetic potential. The pre-clinical anti-nausea/anti-emetic evidence highlights the need for further evaluation of cannabinoids and manipulations of eCBs and other fatty acid amides in clinical trials."

It presents a challenge due to resistance to the current treatment, Metronidazole (MTZ), which is also associated with side effects. Cannabis sativa, with more than 100 phytocannabinoids and numerous studies for therapeutic applications, including parasitic infections, has undergone a significant shift in acceptance worldwide, highlighted by legalizations and substantial revenue projections. In this context, the present study delves into the effects of cannabinoids, specifically WIN 55,212-2 (WIN), Cannabivarin (CBV) showcasing their anti-parasitic actions that influence the growth and morphology of T. vaginalis. The analysis extends to encompass the pharmacokinetic properties of these cannabinoids. Among the analyzed cannabinoids, CBV stands out for adhering to Lipinski's rules, indicating its potential suitability for oral drug delivery. They also demonstrated inhibitory effects on the growth of T. vaginalis trophozoites and a reduction in the parasite's adhesion to host cells. Several morphological alterations were observed, such as membrane projections, blebbing, autophagosomes and damaged hydrogenosomes. These results highlight the need for further research to explore the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids and understand their mechanisms of action in T. vaginalis.",

However, the existence of more than 160 meroterpenoids can be partially explained by a side degree of promiscuity of the geranyltransferase itself, able to recognise different substrate than the ordinary ones. This biological process led to the identification of several unconventional phytocannabinoids with a limited distribution in the plant both for occurrence and concentration. Taking advance of the existing synthetic protocols and using as example the enzymatic promiscuity, we propose a bio-inspired synthesis of naturally occurring minor cannabinoids related to the cannabigerol-type and their preliminary biological inspection in U87, U251 and T98 human glioblastoma cell lines to investigate their potential contribute as supplement in anticancer therapy.",

Radula marginata, an endemic Aotearoa/New Zealand liverwort, produces the bibenzyl cannabinoid perrottetinene (PET), analogous to Cannabis psychoactive tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Structural differences between PET and THC could alter therapeutic interactions and mitigate adverse side effects. To understand the cannabinoid production potential of R. marginata, we analyzed 75 collections from three locations across several seasons, collaborating with kaitiaki Māori (indigenous guardians). Metabolic plasticity of the phytocannabinoids and plant growth was assessed under controlled growth conditions, and in in vitro culture. Perrottetinene diol (trans-PTD), analogous to cannabidiol (trans-CBD), and its acid precursor (PTDA), were identified and fully characterized from nature for the first time. Bibenzyl-4-geranyl (BB4G), analogous to cannabigerol (CBG), and its corresponding acid (BB4GA), were also isolated. Radula marginata showed chemotypes dominated by PET, PTD, or BB4G, in striking analogy to the main Cannabis chemotypes. These site-selective chemotypes persisted after growth under artificial lighting and in in vitro progeny, suggesting genetic control. These results expand phytocannabinoid knowledge through the discovery of PTD analogous to CBD. They add a new dimension to liverwort cannabinoids and suggest convergent evolution of biosynthesis in two distant plant lineages."

AIMS: This systematic review aims to synthesize results from randomized placebo-controlled trials regarding the efficacy and the dosage of cannabinoids as therapeutics in psychiatric disorders in children, adolescents, and young adults. METHODS: All publications up to June 30th, 2024, were included from PubMed and Embase. Eligibility criteria in accordance with the PRISMA-guidelines was applied. RCTs providing pre- and post-treatment parameters on cannabinoid therapies for mental disorders in comparison to controls in an age range from 0 to 25 years were included. Effect sizes were calculated as Hedges' g for primary outcomes, and a multilevel random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to account for dependent outcomes from same study populations. RESULTS: We identified 7603 records, of which 8 independent clinical trials (reported in 9 publications) met the pre-established eligibility criteria, comprising 474 unique participants (245 treatment, 229 control). Analysis of 13 primary outcomes (of 7 clinical trials) revealed a modest positive overall effect for symptom improvement or normalization of brain physiology (Hedges' g = 0.308, 95% CI: 0.167, 0.448). Autism spectrum disorder studies showed the most consistent evidence (g = 0.264, 95% CI: 0.107, 0.421), while other conditions showed wider confidence intervals. Age-stratified analysis showed that adult populations (mean age 23.3 years, n = 5 outcomes) demonstrated higher effect sizes (g = 0.463, SD = 0.402) compared to pediatric populations (mean age 11.8 years, n = 8 outcomes; g = 0.318, SD = 0.212). Whole plant preparations (g = 0.328, 95% CI: 0.083, 0.573) and pharmaceutical cannabinoids (g = 0.292, 95% CI: 0.069, 0.515) showed comparable effects. CBD dosages ranged from 17.5 mg to 600 mg per day, with no significant correlation between dosage and effect size (ρ = -0.014, p = 0.963). Mild to moderate side effects were reported, but no serious adverse events. Risk of bias assessment ranged from low (n = 3) to high (n = 5). CONCLUSION: While meta-analysis of effect sizes for primary outcomes revealed modest positive effects, particularly for autism spectrum disorders, the current evidence remains insufficient to broadly recommend cannabinoids for treating mental disorders in youth populations. Larger, controlled studies with standardized outcomes are needed to establish definitive clinical recommendations."

Cannabinoids may transiently impair night vision, depth perception, binocular and monocular contrast sensitivity, and dynamic visual acuity. Cannabinoids are not currently considered a first-line treatment option for any ocular conditions. Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol been shown to result in short-term intraocular pressure reduction, but insufficient evidence to support its use in treating glaucoma exists. Potential therapeutic applications of cannabinoids include their use as a second-line agent for treatment-refractory blepharospasm, for dry eye disease given corneal anti-inflammatory properties, and for suppression of pendular nystagmus in individuals with multiple sclerosis, which all necessitate further research for informed clinical practices."

METHOD: A pilot trial to assess the feasibility of FSCO in seven CP patients was followed by a prospective double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel trial, with 53 participants aged 5-25 years, randomised in a 1:1 ratio. The double-blind phase lasted six weeks, followed by the open-label phase of six weeks' duration. The primary endpoint was a change in spasticity measured by the modified Ashworth Scale. Secondary outcomes were changes in motor function (Gross Motor Function Measure 88 scale), quality of life, safety, and tolerability. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in spasticity, motor function, and quality of life parameters between patients receiving FSCO or placebo. Patients in the FSCO group were significantly drowsier compared to the placebo group. Adverse events were mild to moderate; there were no life-threatening events. INTERPRETATION: This trial suggests FSCO treatment in children with CP is generally well tolerated and safe. It might have benefits on quality of life. No significant change in spasticity was demonstrated with FSCO treatment compared to the placebo.",

      "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most prevalent primary brain tumor in adults and is known for its rapid proliferation and infiltrative nature. Current therapeutic strategies include surgical resection followed by radio- and chemotherapy. Still, they are hindered by GBM biological characteristics and physical-chemical properties of chemotherapeutic drugs, leading to limited efficacy and poor prognosis. Cannabinoids have emerged as potential anti-GBM agents, exhibiting antiangiogenic, antimetastatic, and antiproliferative effects. However, their hydrophobicity and poor oral bioavailability pose significant challenges for clinical applications. This study evaluates the potential of nanocarriers in enhancing the solubility and targeted delivery of cannabinoids for GBM therapy. The innovative combination of nanotechnology with cannabinoid-based treatment offers a promising strategy to improve therapeutic outcomes. We addressed the application of nanocarriers to deliver cannabinoids, which can enhance passage across the blood-brain barrier and enable targeted therapy. Studies demonstrate the potential of nanocarriers in improving solubility, stability, and controlled release of cannabinoids, highlighting the advancements in nanocarrier design for optimized delivery to glioma cells. Cannabinoids can exert their antitumor effect, including the induction of apoptosis through the ceramide and p8-regulated pathways and the modulation of immune responses. The evidence found in this study supports the potential of cannabinoid-based nanotechnologies in GBM therapeutic regimens as a strategy to enhance its efficacy and patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD), a bicyclic non-psychoactive cannabinoid biosynthesized by Cannabis spp. of plants, has attracted significant interest in the past decade due to its therapeutic properties. In 2018, the US FDA approved Epidiolex®, a CBD-based drug for the treatment of two rare epileptic seizure disorders. CBD possesses two chiral centers at C3 and C4 on its terpenoid moiety and exhibits cis-trans stereoisomerism along the C3-C4 bond axis. (-)-trans-(3R,4R)-CBD, the natural CBD, is biosynthesized by the cannabis plant, while the unnatural (+)-trans-(3S,4S)-CBD is obtained via chemical synthesis. Both trans isomers exhibit broad in vitro and in vivo biological activities; typically, the unnatural stereoisomer (+)-trans-CBD and its derivatives exhibited more potent activities in comparison to the corresponding (-)-trans isomers. On the other hand, cis-CBD isomers have only been reported recently and can undergo epimerization into trans isomers. There is a significant opportunity to explore unique synthetic methods and biological activities of stereoisomers of CBD that may pave the path for the development of novel therapeutics. Herein, as a novel direction in cannabinoids, we review the chemistry of CBD stereoisomers, their structure-activity relationships, target selectivity and efficacy in animal models.",

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the incidence rate difference (IRD) of AEs in middle aged and older adults of age ≥50 years receiving CBMs and also examine associations with weekly doses. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychInfo, Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials.gov (1st Jan 1990-12th June 2023). METHODS: We included randomised clinical trials (RCTs) using CBMs with mean participant age ≥50 years for medicinal purposes for all clinical indications. Paired reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and appraised risk of bias. We estimated pooled effect-sizes IRD under the random-effects model. RESULTS: Data from 58 RCTs (37 moderate-high quality studies, pooled n = 6611, mean age range 50-87 years, 50% male, n = 3450 receiving CBMs) showed that compared with controls, the incidence of all-cause and treatment-related AEs attributable to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing CBMs were: THC alone [IRD:18.83(95% Confidence Interval [CI], 1.47-55.79) and 16.35(95% CI, 1.25-48.56)] respectively; THC:cannabidiol (CBD) combination [IRD:19.37(95% CI, 4.24-45.47) and 11.36(95% CI, 2.55-26.48)] respectively. IRDs of serious AEs, withdrawals and deaths were not significantly greater for CBMs containing THC with or without CBD. THC dose-dependently increased the incidence of dry mouth, dizziness/lightheadedness, mobility/balance/coordination difficulties, dissociative/thinking/perception problems and somnolence/drowsiness. The interaction of weekly THC:CBD doses played a role in mostly neurological, psychiatric and cardiac side-effects. CONCLUSIONS: Although CBMs in general are safe and acceptable in middle aged and older adults, one needs to be mindful of certain common dose-dependent side-effects of THC-containing CBMs.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Peripheral neuropathies are commonly occurring conditions that are chronic and debilitating for patients. Established nonsurgical treatments have yielded mixed and patient-dependent results. Although cannabinoids have demonstrated efficacy as a treatment for central neuropathic pain, the therapeutic potential of cannabis-based medications for the management of peripheral neuropathic pain caused by nerve injury, trauma, and other noncompressive etiologies has yet to be definitively established. This study aims to determine whether cannabinoids are a potentially effective treatment for pain and symptoms associated with peripheral neuropathy. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted by two independent reviewers across PubMed, Cochrane, Ovid Medline, and CINAHL to identify studies in accordance with the predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Information regarding study design, medication, dosage, effect on neuropathic pain, and other related outcomes was extracted. Meta-analysis of pain scores was performed for seven studies, and descriptive statistics were used to summarize other study findings as appropriate. RESULTS: Of the 927 studies identified, 14 randomized controlled trials were included. Thirteen of 14 studies (79%) observed a statistically significant decrease in neuropathic pain score following treatment with a cannabinoid. Meta-analysis yielded a mean difference of -0.67 [-0.89, -0.45]) on a 0-10 scale compared with placebo. Improvements in secondary outcomes such as sleep, sensory symptoms, and quality of life were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis of the literature shows that cannabis-based medicines may be effective in treating the pain and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. These findings suggest the applicability of cannabis-based medicines for peripheral neuropathy. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV."

Herein, a novel electrochemical sensing platform based on Zn/Bi bimetallic organic framework-derived ZnO-Bi2O3 heterojunctions was constructed for the detection of cyclohexanylphenol synthetic cannabinoids (CP-type SCs: CP47,497 and CP55,940). The sensing characteristics of ZnO-Bi2O3 were studied under various conditions, including solvent composition, molar ratio of metal, and calcination temperature. The optimized ZnO-Bi2O3 heterojunction exhibited a larger surface area, more active sites, and stronger stability, conducive to enhanced electrochemical catalytic performance. Under optimal conditions, a ZnO-Bi2O3 modified screen-printed electrode (ZnO-Bi2O3/SPE) showed good linear responses toward CP47,497 and CP55,940 within the concentration ranges 7 × 10-9 ~ 5 × 10-6 M and 1 × 10-9 ~ 5 × 10-6 M, with detection limits of 2.3 × 10-9 M and 3.3 × 10-10 M, respectively. The sensor also depicted excellent reliability and can be used for on-site electrochemical detection of target objects in e-cigarettes with high recovery. Finally, the electrochemical oxidation mechanisms of CP47,497 and CP55,940 were studied for the first time, and electrochemical fingerprints of CP-type SCs were speculated.",

      "abstract": "Chemotherapy is a therapy of choice for many cancers. However, it is often inefficient for long-term patient survival and is usually accompanied by multiple adverse effects. The adverse effects are mainly associated with toxicity to normal cells, frequently resulting in immune system depression, nausea, loss of appetite and metabolic changes. In this respect, the combination of chemotherapy with cannabinoids, especially non-psychoactive, such as cannabidiol, cannabinol and other minor cannabinoids, as well as terpenes, may become very useful. This is especially pertinent because the mechanisms of anticancer effects of cannabinoids on cancer cells are often different from conventional chemotherapeutics. In addition, cannabinoids help alleviate chemotherapy-induced adverse effects, regulate sleep and appetite, and are shown to have analgesic properties. Another component for achieving potential anti-cancer synergism is regulating nutrient availability and metabolism by calorie restriction and intermittent fasting in cancer cells. As tumours require a lot of energy to grow and because glucose is constantly available, malignant cells often opt to use glucose as a primary source of ATP production through substrate-level phosphorylation (fermentation) rather than through oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, periodic depletion of cancer cells of primary fuel, glucose, could result in a strong synergy in killing cancer cells by chemo- and possibly radiotherapy when combined with cannabinoids. This commentary will discuss what is known about such combinatorial treatments, including potential mechanisms and future protocols."

Nowadays, cannabinoids are used for spasticity control in patients with MS, while the efficacy and safety are not clearly understood. So, we designed this systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of cannabinoids for controlling MS-related spasticity. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were systematically searched by two independent researchers on 1 May 2023. They also searched gray literature (references of included studies, as well as conference abstracts). RESULTS: A literature search revealed 6552 records, 95 full-texts were evaluated, and finally, 31 studies remained for systematic review. Among included studies, six randomized trials were included. Nabiximols was the most commonly used medication for controlling MS-related spasticity. Mean Expanded Disability Status Scale ranged between 4.6 and 7. Most studies (17 studies) were done in Italy, followed by Germany (4 studies). The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) of NRS (Numeric Rating Scale) (after-before) is estimated as -1.41 (95% confidence interval (CI): -1.65, -1.17) (I2 = 97%, p < 0.001). The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) of Ashworth (after-before) is estimated as -0.39 (95% CI: -0.72, -0.06) (I2 = 69.9%, p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis showed that nabiximols was the most common cannabinoid which was used to control MS-related spasticity, and it was effective in controlling MS-related spasticity (significantly decreased SMD of NRS, and Ashworth after treatment)."

This systematic review aimed to summarize the efficacy and safety of cannabinoids to treat OSA. Databases including Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, PsycINFO, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts were searched; experimental and observational studies were eligible for inclusion. One-hundred seventy unique records were screened, and nine studies included: five full-text studies and four published abstracts. The five full-text studies were judged for quality appraisal: two studies deemed at low risk for bias, one study deemed to have some concerns for bias, and two studies deemed to have high risk for bias. Seven of nine total studies were experimental designs and evaluated dronabinol, and the other two studies were observational designs evaluating cannabis. The range of cannabinoid therapy duration spanned from 1 to 6 weeks, and the median duration was 3 weeks. Eight of nine total studies reported statistically significant, positive OSA outcomes due to cannabinoid therapy including reductions in the apnea hypopnea index and improvements in patient-reported daytime sleepiness scales. Between 70% and 80% of study participants reported neuropsychiatric and gastrointestinal adverse events attributable to cannabinoids. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine does not recommend using cannabinoids to treat OSA due to a lack of long-term safety and efficacy data. This systematic review found similar limitations, with the median cannabinoid treatment duration being only 3 weeks. Adequately powered experimental trials over longer time frames are necessary to more completely assess the long-term efficacy and safety of cannabinoids in the treatment of OSA and its effects on common comorbid conditions, such as obesity and cardiovascular disease.",

Despite the availability of many antiglaucoma drugs, a significant proportion of patients may experience worsening of the disease. Hence, there is a need for newer antiglaucoma drugs. SUMMARY: Natural and synthetic derivatives of cannabis plants have been studied in the treatment of glaucoma since the 1970s. This review describes the potential mechanisms of the cannabinoids in the treatment of glaucoma, summarizes the findings of clinical studies describing the efficacy of these compounds, and describes the adverse effects observed with the various cannabinoid formulations evaluated in clinical studies of glaucoma in healthy volunteers and patients. The implications of these findings in terms of the potential clinical status of cannabinoids in the treatment of glaucoma and the challenges involved have also been described. KEY MESSAGES: Cannabinoids lower intraocular pressure. However, the effect is short-lived. There is also a lack of well-formulated ocular delivery system. The available evidence is inadequate to recommend the use of cannabinoids for the routine treatment of glaucoma."

      "abstract": "Patients suffering from schizophrenic psychosis show reduced synaptic connectivity compared to healthy individuals, and often, the use of cannabis precedes the onset of schizophrenic psychosis. Therefore, we investigated if different types of cannabinoids impact methylation patterns and expression of schizophrenia candidate genes concerned with the development and preservation of synapses and synaptic function in a SH-SY5Y cell culture model. For this purpose, SH-SY5Y cells were differentiated into a neuron-like cell type as previously described. Effects of the cannabinoids delta-9-THC, HU-210, and Anandamide were investigated by analysis of cell morphology and measurement of neurite/dendrite lengths as well as determination of methylation pattern, expression (real time-qPCR, western blot) and localization (immunocytochemistry) of different target molecules concerned with the formation of synapses. Regarding the global impression of morphology, cells, and neurites appeared to be a bit more blunted/roundish and to have more structures that could be described a bit boldly as resembling transport vesicles under the application of the three cannabinoids in comparison to a sole application of retinoic acid (RA). However, there were no obvious differences between the three cannabinoids. Concerning dendrites or branch lengths, there was a significant difference with longer dendrites and branches in RA-treated cells than in undifferentiated control cells (as shown previously), but there were no differences between cannabinoid treatment and exclusive RA application. Methylation rates in the promoter regions of synapse candidate genes in cannabinoid-treated cells were in between those of differentiated cells and untreated controls, even though findings were significant only in some of the investigated genes. In other targets, the methylation rates of cannabinoid-treated cells did not only approach those of undifferentiated cells but were also valued even beyond. mRNA levels also showed the same tendency of values approaching those of undifferentiated controls under the application of the three cannabinoids for most investigated targets except for the structural molecules (NEFH, MAPT). Likewise, the quantification of expression via western blot analysis revealed a higher expression of targets in RA-treated cells compared to undifferentiated controls and, again, lower expression under the additional application of THC in trend. In line with our earlier findings, the application of RA led to higher fluorescence intensity and/or a differential signal distribution in the cell in most of the investigated targets in ICC. Under treatment with THC, fluorescence intensity decreased, or the signal distribution became similar to the dispersion in the undifferentiated control condition. Our findings point to a decline of neuronal differentiation markers in our in vitro cell-culture system under the application of cannabinoids."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Opioid and cannabinoid therapies for chronic pain conditions including neuropathic pain are controversial. Understanding patient and prescribing factors contributing to risks and implementing risk mitigation strategies optimizes outcomes. LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: The ongoing transformation from a biomedical model of pain care toward a biopsychosocial model has been accompanied by a shift away from opioid therapy for pain, in particular for chronic pain. Opioid overdose deaths and opioid use disorder have greatly increased in the last several decades, initially because of increases in opioid prescribing and more recently associated with illicit drug use, in particular fentanyl derivatives. Opioid risk mitigation strategies may reduce risks related to opioid prescribing and tapering or discontinuation. Opioid therapy guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have become the consensus best practice for opioid therapy. Regulatory agencies and licensing medical boards have implemented restrictions and other mandates regarding opioid therapy. Meanwhile, interest in and use of cannabinoids for chronic pain has grown in the United States. ESSENTIAL POINTS: Opioid therapy is generally not recommended for the chronic treatment of neuropathic pain conditions. Opioids may be considered for temporary use in patients with severe pain related to selected neuropathic pain conditions (such as postherpetic neuralgia), and only as part of a multimodal treatment regimen. Opioid risk mitigation strategies include careful patient selection and evaluation, patient education and informed consent, querying the state prescription drug monitoring programs, urine drug testing, and issuance of naloxone as potential rescue medication. Close follow-up when initiating or adjusting opioid therapy and frequent reevaluation during long-term opioid therapy is required. There is evidence for the efficacy of cannabinoids for neuropathic pain, with meaningful response rates in select patient populations.",

      "abstract": "Cannabinoids are a class of drugs derived from the Cannabis plant that are widely used for the treatment of various medical conditions and recreational use. Common examples include Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), spice, and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). With more than 100 cannabinoids identified, their influence on the nervous system, role in pain management, and effects due to illicit use have been extensively studied. However, their effects on peripheral organs, such as the kidneys, require further examination. With dramatic rises in use, production, and legalization, it is essential to understand the impact and mechanistic properties of these drugs as they pertain to renal and cardiovascular physiology. The goal of this review is to summarize prior literature on the expression of cannabinoid receptors and how cannabinoids influence renal function. This review first discusses the interaction of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) and renal physiology and pathophysiology. Following, we briefly discuss the role of the ECS in various kidney diseases and the potential therapeutic applications of drugs targeting the cannabinoid system. Lastly, recent studies have identified several detrimental effects of cannabinoids, not only on the kidney but also in contributing to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Thus, the negative impact of cannabinoids on renal function and the development of various cardiovascular diseases is also discussed.",

      "abstract": "Dysfunction or damage to the nervous system may develop into and result in a chronic pain condition known as neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is defined as the structural and functional alteration of the somatosensory component of the nervous system. The treatment of neuropathic pain is a complex endeavor, which often requires specialist care and intensive drug therapy. Recently, cannabinoids have emerged as an alternative and natural option for the treatment of chronic pain, with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) being the most extensively studied neuroactive components. The therapeutic potential of cannabis remains largely underexplored, primarily due to its social stigma and the restrictions that are in place on its cultivation. The primary aim of this systematic review was to explore the therapeutic value of cannabinoids in the management of chronic pain and thus achieve an improved quality of life for those patients. A systematic review of the literature published over the last two decades was performed using the following databases: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Turning research into practice (Trip), and Google Scholar. Studies that were completed and published between January 01, 2000 and August 31, 2024, in English language, were extracted and appraised. A combination of keywords and Boolean operators Cannabis OR Chronic Pain OR End of life OR Pain Management AND Drug therapy was employed for data extraction. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) was used for risk-of-bias assessment. The initial search resulted in 125282 articles; 86,781 of the articles were identified as duplicates and were removed from the primary analysis, and 38,501 abstracts were thus screened. Abstracts, case studies, reports, editorials, viewpoints, cross-sectional studies, cohort studies, case-control studies, case series, and letters to the editor/correspondence manuscripts (n =38,492) were furthermore excluded. Nine full-text articles were critically assessed and tested against the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and a further four articles were excluded with a total of five placebo-controlled randomized control studies being ultimately included in the final systematic review. Compared to placebo, cannabinoids provided significant relief from chronic pain (33% vs 15%) as measured by the visual analog scale. The transdermal application of CBD led to a more pronounced reduction in sharp pain, according to the neuropathic pain scale. Minimal to no side effects were recorded, further highlighting the potential benefits of cannabinoids."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epitranscriptomic modifications modulate diverse biological processes like regulation of gene expression, abundance, location and function. N6-methyladenosine (m 6 A) methylation has been shown to regulate various diseases, including cancer and inflammation. While there is evidence that m 6 A modification is functionally relevant in neural development and differentiation, the role of m 6 A modification in HIV neuropathogenesis is unknown. METHODS: Here, we used anti-N6-methyladenosine (m 6 A) antibody immunoprecipitation and microarray profiling to identify m 6 A modifications in miRNAs in basal ganglia (BG) of Rhesus macaques (RMs) that were uninfected (VEH) and SIV-infected on combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART) and either VEH-treated (VEH/SIV/cART), or THC:CBD-treated (THC:CBD/SIV/cART). Ingenuity pathway analysis was conducted to understand the biological implications of miRNA m 6 A methylation in HIV neuropathogenesis. Finally, to understand the functional significance of m 6 A modifications in miRNAs, we overexpressed FAM-labeled wild-type or m 6 A-modified miR-194-5p in SCC-25 cells and determined its impact on the expression of its target, STAT1, an interferon-stimulated transcription factor known to drive persistent neuroinflammation in several neurodegenerative diseases. RESULTS: HIV/SIV infection promoted an overall hypomethylated miRNA m 6 A profile. While the overall hypomethylated m 6 A profile was not significantly impacted by THC:CBD, specific miRNAs predicted to target proinflammatory genes showed markedly reduced m 6 A methylation levels compared to the VEH-treated RMs. Additionally, specific BG tissue miRNAs bearing m 6 A epi-transcriptomic marks were transferred and detected in BG-derived extracellular vesicles. Mechanistically, the DRACH motif in the seed region of miR-194-5p was significantly m 6 A hypomethylated in THC:CBD/SIV/cART RMs. In SCC-25 cells, unlike wild-type miR-194-5p, transfected m 6 A-modified miR-194-5p mimics failed to downregulate STAT1 protein expression. Further, compared to VEH/SIV/cART RMs, THC:CBD administration significantly reduced m 6 A methylation of 44 miRNAs directly involved in regulating CNS network genes. CONCLUSIONS: These results underscore the need for investigating the qualitative, and posttranscriptional modifications in RNA along with the more traditional, quantitative alterations in pathological conditions or in response to disease modifying treatments. Our findings indicate that m 6 A epitranscriptomic marks in the seed nucleotide region can impair miRNA function and that cannabinoids may preserve it by reducing m 6 A methylation levels. Finally, these findings provide a novel mechanistic (miRNA m 6 A hypomethylation) explanation underlying the anti-neuroinflammatory effects of phytocannabinoids in HIV/SIV infection."

      "abstract": "Migraine is a common and complex neurological disorder that has a high impact on quality of life. Recent advances with drugs that target the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) have helped, but treatment options remain insufficient. CGRP is released from trigeminal sensory fibers and contributes to peripheral sensitization, perhaps in part due to actions on immune cells in the trigeminovascular system. In this review, we will discuss the potential of cannabinoid targeting of immune cells as an innovative therapeutic target for migraine treatment. We will cover endogenous endocannabinoids, plant-derived phytocannabinoids and synthetically derived cannabinoids. The focus will be on six types of immune cells known to express multiple cannabinoid receptors: macrophages, monocytes, mast cells, dendritic cells, B cells, and T cells. These cells also contain receptors for CGRP and as such, cannabinoids might potentially modulate the efficacy of current CGRP-targeting drugs. Unfortunately, to date most studies on cannabinoids and immune cells have relied on cell cultures and only a single preclinical study has tested cannabinoid actions on immune cells in a migraine model. Encouragingly, in that study a synthetically created stable chiral analog of an endocannabinoid reduced meningeal mast cell degranulation. Likewise, clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of cannabinoid-based therapies for migraine patients have been limited but are encouraging. Thus, the field is at its infancy and there are significant gaps in our understanding of the impact of cannabinoids on immune cells in migraine. Future research exploring the interactions between cannabinoids and immune cells could lead to more targeted and effective migraine treatments.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer therapy has been facing remarkable changes. Classic treatments are now combined with other therapies to improve efficacy and surpass resistance. Indeed, the emergence of resistance demands the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Due to key estrogen signaling, estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer treatment has always been focused on aromatase inhibition and ER modulation. Lately, the effects of phytocannabinoids, mainly Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), have been evaluated in different cancers, including breast. However, Cannabis sativa contains more than 120 phytocannabinoids less researched and understood. METHODS: Here, we evaluated, both in silico and in vitro, the ability of 129 phytocannabinoids to modulate important molecular targets in ER+ breast cancer: aromatase, ER, and androgen receptor (AR). RESULTS: In silico results suggested that some cannabinoids may inhibit aromatase and act as ERα antagonists. Nine selected cannabinoids showed, in vitro, potential to act either as ER antagonists with inverse agonist properties, or as ER agonists. Moreover, these cannabinoids were considered as weak aromatase inhibitors and AR antagonists with inverse agonist action. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we present, for the first time, a comprehensive analysis of the actions of the phytocannabinoids in targets of ER+ breast tumors, pointing out their therapeutic potential in cancer and in other diseases."

      "abstract": "For centuries, cannabinoids have been utilized for their medicinal properties, particularly in Asian and South-Asian countries. Cannabis plants, known for their psychoactive and non-psychoactive potential, were historically used for spiritual and remedial healing. However, as cannabis became predominantly a recreational drug, it faced prohibition. Recently, the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids has sparked renewed research interest, extending their use to various medical conditions, including cancer. This review aims to highlight current data on the involvement of cannabinoids in cancer signaling pathways, emphasizing their potential in cancer therapy and the need for further investigation into the underlying mechanisms. A comprehensive literature review was conducted using databases such as PubMed/MedLine, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase. The search focused on peer-reviewed articles, review articles, and clinical trials discussing the anticancer properties of cannabinoids. Inclusion criteria included studies in English on the mechanisms of action and clinical efficacy of cannabinoids in cancer. Cannabinoids, including Δ9-THC, CBD, and CBG, exhibit significant anticancer activities such as apoptosis induction, autophagy stimulation, cell cycle arrest, anti-proliferation, anti-angiogenesis, and metastasis inhibition. Clinical trials have demonstrated cannabinoids' efficacy in tumor regression and health improvement in palliative care. However, challenges such as variability in cannabinoid composition, psychoactive effects, regulatory barriers, and lack of standardized dosing remain. Cannabinoids show promising potential as anticancer agents through various mechanisms. Further large-scale, randomized controlled trials are essential to validate these findings and establish standardized therapeutic protocols. Future research should focus on elucidating detailed mechanisms, optimizing dosing, and exploring cannabinoids as primary chemotherapeutic agents."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Glucose homeostasis is regulated by a dynamic interplay between hormones along the gastro-insular axis. For example, enteroendocrine L- and K- cells that line the intestine produce the incretins glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), respectively, which are secreted following a meal. Broadly, incretin signaling enhances insulin release from the endocrine pancreas and participates in the control of food intake, and therapeutics that mimic their activity have recently been developed for the treatment of type-2 diabetes and obesity. Notably, genes for cannabinoid subtype-1 receptor (CB1R) are expressed in these cell subpopulations; however, roles for CB1Rs in controlling fat-induced incretin release are unclear. To address this gap in our understanding, we tested the hypothesis that intestinal epithelial CB1Rs control fat-induced incretin secretion. METHODS: We treated mice with conditional deletion of CB1Rs in the intestinal epithelium (IntCB1-/-) or controls (IntCB1+/+) with oil gavage to stimulate incretin release in the presence of the cannabinoid receptor agonists, WIN55,212-2 or Δ9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and the peripherally-restricted CB1R antagonist AM6545. Circulating incretin levels were measured in plasma. RESULTS: Oral gavage of corn oil increased levels of bioactive GLP1 and GIP in IntCB1+/+ mouse plasma. Pretreatment with the WIN55,212-2 or THC blocked this response, which was largely reversed by coadministration with AM6545. WIN55,212-2 failed to inhibit fat-induced GIP release, but not GLP1, in IntCB1-/- mice. In contrast, THC inhibited the secretion of incretins irrespective of CB1R expression in intestinal epithelial cells. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that cannabinoid receptor agonists can differentially inhibit incretin release via mechanisms that include intestinal epithelial CB1R-dependent and CB1R-independent mechanisms."

Evidence of the safety of cannabinoids in this context is sparse, creating a need for reliable information to close this knowledge gap. OBJECTIVE: To study the adverse event profile of cannabinoids used for medical purposes in children and adolescents. DATA SOURCES: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomized clinical trials published from database inception to March 1, 2024, for subject terms and keywords focused on cannabis and children and adolescents. Search results were restricted to human studies in French or English. STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers independently performed the title, abstract, and full-text review, data extraction, and quality assessment. Included studies enrolled at least 1 individual 18 years or younger, had a natural or pharmaceutical cannabinoid used as an intervention to manage any medical condition, and had an active comparator or placebo. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers performed data extraction and quality assessment independently. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline and PRISMA-S guideline were used. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the incidence of withdrawals, withdrawals due to adverse events, overall adverse events, and serious adverse events in the cannabinoid and control arms. Secondary outcomes were the incidence of specific serious adverse events and adverse events based on organ system involvement. RESULTS: Of 39 175 citations, 23 RCTs with 3612 participants were included (635 [17.6%] female and 2071 [57.3%] male; data not available from 2 trials); 11 trials (47.8%) included children and adolescents only, and the other 12 trials (52.2%) included children, adolescents, and adults. Interventions included purified cannabidiol (11 [47.8%]), nabilone (4 [17.4%]), tetrahydrocannabinol (3 [13.0%]), cannabis herbal extract (3 [13.0%]), and dexanabinol (2 [8.7%]). The most common indications were epilepsy (9 [39.1%]) and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (7 [30.4%]). Compared with the control, cannabinoids were associated with an overall increased risk of adverse events (risk ratio [RR], 1.09; 95% CI, 1.02-1.16; I2 = 54%; 12 trials), withdrawals due to adverse events (RR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.73-5.43; I2 = 0%; 14 trials), and serious adverse events (RR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.21-2.71; I2 = 59%; 11 trials). Cannabinoid-associated adverse events with higher RRs were diarrhea (RR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.30-2.54; I2 = 35%; 10 trials), increased serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (RR, 5.69; 95% CI, 1.74-18.64; I2 = 0%; 5 trials) and alanine aminotransferase (RR, 5.67; 95% CI, 2.23-14.39; I2 = 0%; 6 trials), and somnolence (RR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.83-2.85; I2 = 8%; 14 trials). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, cannabinoids used for medical purposes in children and adolescents in RCTs were associated with an increased risk of adverse events. The findings suggest that long-term safety studies, including those exploring cannabinoid-related drug interactions and tools that improve adverse event reporting, are needed.",

      "abstract": "With the recent introduction of a number of highly effective disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) and the resulting almost complete prevention of acute relapses in many patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), the interest of MS clinicians has gradually shifted from relapse prevention to counteraction of disease progression and the treatment of residual symptoms. Targeting the cannabinoid system with nabiximols is an approved and effective strategy for the treatment of spasticity secondary to MS. Recently, the concept of spasticity plus syndrome (SPS) was introduced to account for the evidence that spasticity often appears in MS patients in clusters with other symptoms (such as pain, bladder dysfunction, sleep, and mood disorders), where cannabinoids can also be effective due to their broader action on many immune and neuronal functions. Interestingly, outside these symptomatic benefits, extensive pre-clinical and clinical research indicated how the modulation of the cannabinoid system results in significant anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, all potentially relevant for MS disease control. This evidence makes nabiximols a potential disease modifying symptomatic treatment (DMST), a concept introduced in an attempt to overcome the often artificial distinction between DMTs and symptomatic therapies (STs).",

The pharmacologically active compounds in Cannabis, such as delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, exhibit diverse immunomodulatory properties. Although studies have explored the effects of cannabinoids on immune function, their specific interactions with the thymus, a primary immune organ critical for T-cell development and maturation, remain an intriguing area of investigation. As the thymus plays a fundamental role in shaping the immune repertoire, understanding the interplay between cannabinoids and thymic function may shed light on potential benefits or concerns associated with Cannabis-based therapies.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Obesity is a chronic noncommunicable disease characterized by excessive body fat that can have negative health consequences. Obesity is a complex disease caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. It is characterized by a discrepancy between caloric intake and expenditure. Obesity increases the risk of acquiring major chronic diseases, including heart disease, stroke, cancer, and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Currently, the inhibition of pancreatic lipases (PL) is a promising pharmacological therapy for obesity and weight management. In this study, the inhibition of pancreatic lipase by Cannabis sativa (C. sativa) plant extract and cannabinoids was investigated. METHODS: The inhibitory effect was assessed using p-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB), and the results were obtained by calculating the percentage relative activity and assessed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Kinetic studies and spectroscopy techniques were used to evaluate the mode of inhibition. Diet-induced; and diabetic rat models were studied to evaluate the direct effects of C. sativa extract on PL activity. RESULTS: Kinetic analyses showed that the plant extracts inhibited pancreatic lipase, with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabinol (CBN) being the potential cause of the inhibition noted for the C. sativa plant extract. CBN and THC inhibited the pancreatic lipase activity in a competitive manner, with the lowest residual enzyme activity of 52 % observed at a 10 μg/mL concentration of CBN and 39 % inhibition at a 25 μg/mL concentration of THC. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy revealed that the inhibitors caused a change in the enzyme's secondary structure. At low concentrations, THC showed potential for synergistic inhibition with orlistat. C.sativa treatment in an in vivo rat model confirmed its inhibitory effects on pancreatic lipase activity. CONCLUSION: The findings in this study provided insight into the use of cannabinoids as pancreatic lipase inhibitors and the possibility of using these compounds to develop new pharmacological treatments for obesity.",

Comprehensive searches were conducted across multiple databases, including CINAHL, Cochrane library, Medline, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and LILACS, encompassing records up to May 22, 2024. Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Eleven were animal studies, predominantly utilizing murine models (n = 10) and one equine model, involving 437 animals. The seven human studies ranged from case reports to randomized controlled trials, encompassing 92 participants aged six months to ninety years, with sample sizes varying from 1 to 69 patients. The studies examined the effects of various cannabinoid formulations, including combinations with other plant extracts, crude extracts, and purified and synthetic cannabis-based medications administered topically, intraperitoneally, orally, or sublingually. Four animal and three human studies reported complete wound closure. Hemp fruit oil extract, cannabidiol (CBD), and GP1a resulted in complete wound closure in twenty-three (range: 5-84) days with a healing rate of 66-86% within ten days in animal studies. One human study documented a wound healing rate of 3.3 cm2 over 30 days, while three studies on chronic, non-healing wounds reported an average healing time of 54 (21-150) days for 17 patients by oral oils with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and CBD and topical gels with THC, CBD, and terpenes. CBD and tetrahydrocannabidiol demonstrated significant potential in reducing bacterial loads in murine models. However, further high-quality research is imperative to fully elucidate the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids in the treatment of bacterial skin infections and wounds. Additionally, it is crucial to delineate the impact of medicinal cannabis on the various phases of wound healing. This study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021255413)."

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, manifests through dysregulation of brain function and subsequent loss of bodily control, attributed to β-amyloid plaque deposition and TAU protein hyperphosphorylation and aggregation, leading to neuronal death. Concurrently, similar cannabinoids to the ones derived from Cannabis sativa are present in the endocannabinoid system, acting through receptors CB1R and CB2R and other related receptors such as Trpv-1 and GPR-55, and are being extensively investigated for AD therapy. Given the limited efficacy and adverse effects of current available treatments, alternative approaches are crucial. Therefore, this review aims to identify effective natural and synthetic cannabinoids and elucidate their beneficial actions for AD treatment. PubMed and Scopus databases were queried (2014-2024) using keywords such as \"Alzheimer's disease\" and \"cannabinoids\". The majority of natural (Δ9-THC, CBD, AEA, etc.) and synthetic (JWH-133, WIN55,212-2, CP55-940, etc.) cannabinoids included showed promise in improving memory, cognition, and behavioral symptoms, potentially via pathways involving antioxidant effects of selective CB1R agonists (such as the BDNF/TrkB/Akt pathway) and immunomodulatory effects of selective CB2R agonists (TLR4/NF-κB p65 pathway). Combining anticholinesterase properties with a cannabinoid moiety may enhance therapeutic responses, addressing cholinergic deficits of AD brains. Thus, the positive outcomes of the vast majority of studies discussed support further advancing cannabinoids in clinical trials for AD treatment.",

Prior meta-analysis has shown inconclusive evidence for efficacy of cannabinoids. We sought to produce an up-to-date meta-analysis that pools new data to evaluate the therapeutic effects of cannabinoids in both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL and CINAHL were queried for randomized-controlled trials evaluating the impact cannabinoids in CD or UC. Random effects modeling was used to compute pooled estimates of risk difference. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2. RESULTS: Eight studies, including 4 studies of CD, 3 studies of UC, and 1 study of both diseases met inclusion criteria. Among 5 studies of CD, a statistically significant decrease in clinical disease activity following intervention was observed (risk ratios [RR],  -0.91; 95% CI, CI:1.54 to CI:0.28, I2 = 71.9%). Clinical disease activity in UC was not significantly lower in the pooled analysis (RR, -2.13; 95% CI, -4.80 to 0.55; I2 = 90.3%). Improvement in quality of life (QoL) was observed in both CD and UC combined (RR, 1.79; 95% CI, 0.92-0.2.66; I2 = 82.8%), as well as individually. No differences were observed in the analysis on endoscopic disease activity and inflammatory markers. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis of clinical trials suggests that cannabinoids are associated with improved quality of life in both CD and UC, as well as improved disease activity but not inflammation.",

Until recently, treatment options for TNBC were limited to chemotherapy. A new successful systemic treatment is immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors, but new tumor-specific biomarkers are needed to improve patient outcomes. Cannabinoids show antitumor activity in most preclinical studies in TNBC models and do not appear to have adverse effects on chemotherapy. Clinical data are needed to evaluate efficacy and safety in humans. Importantly, the endocannabinoid system is linked to the immune system and immunosuppression. Therefore, cannabinoid receptors could be a potential biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy or a novel mechanism to reverse resistance to immunotherapy.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and degenerative disease of the central nervous system. More than 90,000 Canadians are affected; a cure is yet to be found. Available treatments to manage the disease course are only partially effective. For many years, persons with MS (PwMS) have used cannabis to relax, to reduce pain and spasticity, or to improve sleep and daily functioning, despite the lack of scientific evidence on the efficacy of specific cannabinoids [i.e., tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD)] on these MS symptoms. The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the effectiveness of different doses of these cannabinoids, alone or combined, on spasticity relief, compared to placebo. Moreover, we aim to determine which treatment is best effective to address other key MS conditions. METHODS: A double-blinded, randomized, factorial, placebo-controlled trial will be performed. We intend to include up to 250 PwMS aged over 21 recruited from the Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal MS Clinic. PwMS will be randomly assigned on a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the trial arms: THC alone, CBD alone, THC/CBD combination, or placebo, using stratified blocked randomization, with random blocks within each stratum. The primary outcome is a self-assessment of spasticity using the mean Numeric Rating Scale score over 7 days. The main outcome will be the difference in this score at 4 weeks compared to baseline. Secondary outcomes include assessments of spasticity as measured by a clinician, pain, fatigue, sleep, bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunction, restless legs syndrome, mental health, quality of life, mobility, cognitive functioning, and adverse events. Treatment responders are eligible for a 12-week extension phase, using the same treatment allocation and assessments. DISCUSSION: Previous clinical studies examined the efficacy of cannabis-based medicines in PwMS, mostly using products with 1:1 THC/CBD ratio. The major barrier to effectively use cannabis in real-world clinical settings is the lack of evidence on benefits of specific cannabinoids and information on possible related risks. The CANSEP study will contribute to overcome these limitations and identify the risks and benefits of cannabis-based treatments in PwMS. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.Gov, NCT05092191."

      "abstract": "This integrative review addresses the potential of the Endocannabinoid System (ES) and cannabinoids in the pathogenesis and treatment of periodontal disease (PD). Cannabinoid receptors are expressed in healthy and inflamed periodontal tissues, indicating a potential regulatory role for SEC in oral homeostasis. Healthy periodontal cells express more CB1 receptors, while inflamed sites show increased CB2 receptors. This suggests a dynamic involvement of the SEC in the inflammatory response associated with PD. Cannabinoids such as cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabinoid receptor agonists such as HU-308, anandamide (AEA), and methanamide (Meta-AEA) have demonstrated promising therapeutic potential in studies. CBD has been associated with the control of bone resorption, antibacterial activity, and increased production of gingival fibroblasts, indicating effects in mitigating the progression of PD. HU-308 demonstrated preventive effects against alveolar bone loss, and anti-inflammatory, osteoprotective, and pro-homeostatic properties in animal models of periodontitis. AEA and Meta-AEA have anti-inflammatory effects by reducing pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α. The activation of cannabinoid receptors attenuates inflammatory processes, inhibits alveolar bone loss, exerts antibacterial effects, and promotes tissue repair. However, clinical trials are especially needed to validate these results and explore the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids in the treatment of PD in humans."

Here we report on timeliness to study initiation, enrolment, compliance and retention rates. The target sample size was not reached. Two hundred and five individuals were approached, and 10 consented and were randomized; the rest refused (reasons: cannabis-related stigma/discomfort; too many study visits/insufficient time; unwillingness to undergo a \"washout period\" for three weeks) or were not eligible. The age of those randomized was 58 years (IQR 55-62); 80% were male. Only three met all criteria (30% enrolment compliance); seven were enrolled with minor protocol deviations. Compliance was excellent (100%). Eight (80%) participants completed the study; two (20%) were withdrawn for safety reasons (transaminitis and aggravation of pre-existing anemia). Time to study initiation and recruitment were the most challenging aspects. Ongoing work is required to reduce stigma related to CBMs. Future studies should find a balance between the requirements for safety monitoring and frequency of study visits."

      "abstract": "The inclusion of spent hemp biomass (SHB), an extracted byproduct from industrial cannabidiol (CBD) production, in the diets of dairy cows and lambs appears to be safe with minor effects on the metabolism, including a decrease in circulating cholesterol and increase bilirubinemia, both associated with liver metabolism. Those effects could be consequence of the presence of cannabinoids, particularly Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and CBD in the SHB. This study aimed to study the transcriptional profile of the liver of dairy cows and lambs fed SHB. Dairy cows received SHB or alfalfa pellet for four weeks of intervention (IP) and four weeks of withdrawal periods (WP). Finishing lambs were fed a control diet (CON), 10% (LH2), or 20% (HH2) SHB for 2 months or 1 month followed by 1-month SHB withdrawal (LH1 and HH1, respectively). RNA sequencing was performed, and the mRNA was annotated using the latest reference genomes. The RNAseq data were filtered, normalized for library size and composition, and statistically analyzed by DESeq2. The bioinformatic analysis was performed by using DAVID, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), and the Dynamic Impact Approach. Using a 0.2 FDR cut-off, we identified only ≤24 differentially expressed genes (DEG) in the liver by feeding SHB in dairy cows and a larger number of DEGs in lambs (from 71 in HH1 vs. CON to 552 in LH1 vs. CON). The KEGG analysis demonstrated that feeding SHB in dairy cows and lambs had relatively minor to moderate metabolic alterations in dairy cows and lambs mainly associated with amino acids and lipid metabolism whereas cholesterol synthesis was overall activated in lambs. GSEA identified activation of the PPAR signaling pathway only in dairy cows. We found an opposite effect on activation of metabolism of drug and xenobiotics by cytochrome P450 enzymes in dairy cows and lambs receiving less SHB but an inhibition in HH2 lambs. Immune system-related pathways were inhibited by feeding SHB in lambs, but the impact was minor. Cumulatively, inclusion of SHB containing cannabinoids in dairy and lambs demonstrate very little effects on the alteration of transcriptomic profile of the liver.",

      "abstract": "The endocannabinoid system is composed by a complex and ubiquitous network of endogenous lipid ligands, enzymes for their synthesis and degradation, and receptors, which can also be stimulated by exogenous compounds, such as those derived from the Cannabis sativa. Cannabis and its bioactive compounds, including cannabinoids and non-cannabinoids, have been extensively studied in different conditions. Recent data have shown that the endocannabinoid system is responsible for maintaining the homeostasis of various skin functions such as proliferation, differentiation and release of inflammatory mediators. Because of their role in regulating these key processes, cannabinoids have been studied for the treatment of skin cancers and melanoma; their anti-tumour effects regulate skin cancer progression and are mainly related to the inhibition of tumour growth, proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis, through apoptosis and autophagy induction. This review aims at summarising the current field of research on the potential uses of cannabinoids in the melanoma field.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting about 1% of children. The disorder is characterized by difficulties within three core symptoms: social interactions, communication, and restricted or repetitive behavior. There is currently no approved psychopharmacological treatment; however, it is hypothesized that ASD symptoms might be ameliorated by manipulating the endocannabinoid (eCB) system.This study aims to review the existing research on cannabinoids as a potential effective treatment for the core symptoms of ASD in children and adolescents. METHODS: A literature search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, APA PsychInfo, and Cochrane. The available literature was screened, and studies were included if: the study population consisted of children/adolescents, the treatment involved cannabinoids, and the outcome assessed was the impact on core ASD symptoms. RESULTS: The search yielded five studies, two RCTs and three cohort studies. All the included studies reported an effect of the cannabinoid treatment; however, most of these effects were non-significant and not related to core symptoms. Only one study found a significant improvement on all three core symptoms. The risk of bias was rated as \"high\" or \"very high\" in four studies and as \"low\" in one study. DISCUSSION: Although the included studies did not find substantial results regarding core ASD symptoms, they all reported that cannabinoid treatment had other positive effects. However, Long term outcome is unknown, and safety aspects are scarcely discussed. CONCLUSION: Based on this review, the effect of cannabinoid treatment on ASD core symptoms is not clear; therefore, further studies are required.",

      "abstract": "Cannabinoids, notably cannabidiol (CBD) and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), have emerged as promising candidates for anxiety disorder treatment, supported by both preclinical and clinical evidence. CBD exhibits notable anxiolytic effects with a favourable safety profile, though concerns regarding mild side effects and drug interactions remain. Conversely, THC, the primary psychoactive compound, presents a range of side effects, underscoring the importance of careful dosage management and individualized treatment strategies. So far there are no FDA approved cannabinoid medications for anxiety. The review highlights challenges in cannabinoid research, including dosage variability, variable preclinical data, and limited long-term data. Despite these limitations, cannabinoids represent a promising avenue for anxiety management, with the potential for further optimization in formulation, dosing protocols, and consideration of interactions with conventional therapies. Addressing these challenges could pave the way for novel and personalized approaches to treating anxiety disorders using cannabinoid-based therapies.",

      "abstract": "Marijuana has been used by humans for thousands of years for both medicinal and recreational purposes. This included the treatment of pain, inflammation, seizures, and nausea. In the 1960s, the structure of the principal psychoactive ingredient Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol was determined, and over the next few decades, two cannabinoid receptors were characterized along with the human endocannabinoid system and what it affects. This includes metabolism, the cardiovascular and reproductive systems, and it is involved in such conditions as inflammation, cancer, glaucoma, and liver and musculoskeletal disorders. In the central nervous system, the endocannabinoid system has been linked to appetite, learning, memory, and conditions such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, stroke, multiple sclerosis, neurodegeneration, addiction, and epilepsy. It was the profound effectiveness of cannabidiol, a non-psychoactive ingredient of marijuana, to relieve the symptoms of Dravet syndrome, a severe form of childhood epilepsy, that recently helped spur marijuana research. This has helped substantially to change society's attitude towards this potential source of useful drugs. However, research has also revealed that the actions of endocannabinoids, such as anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, and the phytocannabinoids, tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, were not just due to interactions with the two cannabinoid receptors but by acting directly on many other targets including various G-protein receptors and cation channels, such as the transient receptor potential channels for example. This mini-review attempts to survey the effects of these 4 important cannabinoids on these currently identified targets."

      "abstract": "Cannabis, often recognized as the most widely used illegal psychoactive substance globally, has seen a shift in its legal status in several countries and regions for both recreational and medicinal uses. This change has brought to light new evidence linking cannabis consumption to various vascular conditions. Specifically, there is an association between cannabis use and atherosclerosis, along with conditions such as arteritis, reversible vasospasm, and incidents of aortic aneurysm or dissection. Recent research has started to reveal the mechanisms connecting cannabinoid compounds to atherosclerosis development. It is well known that the primary biological roles of cannabinoids operate through the activation of cannabinoid receptor types 1 and 2. Manipulation of the endocannabinoid system, either genetically or pharmacologically, is emerging as a promising approach to address metabolic dysfunctions related to obesity. Additionally, numerous studies have demonstrated the vasorelaxant properties and potential atheroprotective benefits of cannabinoids. In preclinical trials, cannabidiol is being explored as a treatment option for monocrotaline-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension. Although existing literature suggests a direct role of cannabinoids in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, the correlation between cannabinoids and other vascular diseases was only reported in some case series or observational studies, and its role and precise mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, it is necessary to summarize and update previously published studies. This review article aims to summarize the latest clinical and experimental research findings on the relationship between cannabis use and vascular diseases. It also seeks to shed light on the potential mechanisms underlying these associations, offering a comprehensive view of current knowledge in this evolving field of study.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a shared burden for 68.1% of oncological patients undergoing chemotherapy with Paclitaxel (PTX). The symptoms are intense and troublesome, patients reporting paresthesia, loss of sensation, and dysesthetic pain. While current medications focus on decreasing the symptom intensity, often ineffective, no medication is yet recommended by the guidelines for the prevention of CIPN. Cannabinoids are an attractive option, as their neuroprotective features have already been demonstrated in neuropathies with other etiologies, by offering the peripheral neurons protection against toxic effects, which promotes analgesia. Methods: We aim to screen several new cannabinoids for their potential use as neuroprotective agents for CIPN by investigating the cellular toxicity profile and by assessing the potential neuroprotective features against PTX using a primary dorsal root ganglion neuronal culture. Results: Our study showed that synthetic cannabinoids JWH-007, AM-694 and MAB-CHMINACA and phytocannabinoids Cannabixir® Medium dried flowers (NC1) and Cannabixir® THC full extract (NC2) preserve the viability of fibroblasts and primary cultured neurons, in most of the tested dosages and time-points. The combination between the cannabinoids and PTX conducted to a cell viability of 70%-89% compared to 40% when PTX was administered alone for 48 h. When assessing the efficacy for neuroprotection, the combination between cannabinoids and PTX led to better preservation of neurite length at all tested time-points compared to controls, highly drug and exposure-time dependent. By comparison, the combination of the cannabinoids and PTX administered for 24 h conducted to axonal shortening between 23% and 44%, as opposed to PTX only, which shortened the axons by 63% compared to their baseline values. Discussion and Conclusion: Cannabinoids could be potential new candidates for the treatment of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy; however, our findings need to be followed by additional tests to understand the exact mechanism of action, which would support the translation of the cannabinoids in the oncological clinical practice."

Effective therapeutic strategies against this novel coronavirus remain limited, underscoring the urgent need for innovative approaches. The present research investigates the potential of cannabis compounds as therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 through their interaction with the virus's papain-like protease (PLpro) protein, a crucial element in viral replication and immune evasion. Computational methods, including molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, were employed to screen cannabis compounds against PLpro and analyze their binding mechanisms and interaction patterns. The results showed cannabinoids with binding affinities ranging from -6.1 kcal/mol to -4.6 kcal/mol, forming interactions with PLpro. Notably, Cannabigerolic and Cannabidiolic acids exhibited strong binding contacts with critical residues in PLpro's active region, indicating their potential as viral replication inhibitors. MD simulations revealed the dynamic behavior of cannabinoid-PLpro complexes, highlighting stable binding conformations and conformational changes over time. These findings shed light on the mechanisms underlying cannabis interaction with SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, aiding in the rational design of antiviral therapies. Future research will focus on experimental validation, optimizing binding affinity and selectivity, and preclinical assessments to develop effective treatments against COVID-19.",

      "abstract": "The enduring relationship between humanity and the cannabis plant has witnessed significant transformations, particularly with the widespread legalization of medical cannabis. This has led to the recognition of diverse pharmacological formulations of medical cannabis, containing 545 identified natural compounds, including 144 phytocannabinoids like Δ9-THC and CBD. Cannabinoids exert distinct regulatory effects on physiological processes, prompting their investigation in neurodegenerative diseases. Recent research highlights their potential in modulating protein aggregation and mitochondrial dysfunction, crucial factors in conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease, multiple sclerosis, or Parkinson's disease. The discussion emphasizes the importance of maintaining homeodynamics in neurodegenerative disorders and explores innovative therapeutic approaches such as nanoparticles and RNA aptamers. Moreover, cannabinoids, particularly CBD, demonstrate anti-inflammatory effects through the modulation of microglial activity, offering multifaceted neuroprotection including mitigating aggregation. Additionally, the potential integration of cannabinoids with vitamin B12 presents a holistic framework for addressing neurodegeneration, considering their roles in homeodynamics and nervous system functioning including the hippocampal neurogenesis. The potential synergistic therapeutic benefits of combining CBD with vitamin B12 underscore a promising avenue for advancing treatment strategies in neurodegenerative diseases. However, further research is imperative to fully elucidate their effects and potential applications, emphasizing the dynamic nature of this field and its potential to reshape neurodegenerative disease treatment paradigms."

This review critically evaluates current knowledge about the mechanisms of action and biological effects of endocannabinoids and phytocannabinoids on GIT functions and the potential therapeutic applications of these compounds. The results of ex vivo and in vivo preclinical data indicate that cannabinoids can both inhibit and stimulate gut peristalsis, depending on various factors. Endocannabinoids affect peristalsis in a cannabinoid (CB) receptor-specific manner; however, there is also an important interaction between them and the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) system. Phytocannabinoids such as Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) impact gut motility mainly through the CB1 receptor. They were also found to improve intestinal barrier integrity, mainly through CB1 receptor stimulation but also via protein kinase A (PKA), mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK), and adenylyl cyclase signaling pathways, as well as by influencing the expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins. The anti-inflammatory effects of cannabinoids in GIT disorders are postulated to occur by the lowering of inflammatory factors such as myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and regulation of cytokine levels. In conclusion, there is a prospect of utilizing cannabinoids as components of therapy for GIT disorders.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Anorexia of aging (AoA) is a prevalent geriatric syndrome characterized by a multifactorial decline in appetite and reduced food intake associated with the aging process. This systematic review aims to investigate the use and outcomes of cannabinoids in addressing AoA, with the goal of providing a comprehensive understanding and discussing their potential integration into daily clinical practice. METHODS: A thorough search of databases (Embase Ovid, Scopus, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) identified 6100 studies. After eliminating duplicates and screening titles and abstracts, 25 studies underwent full appraisal. Two reviewers assessed inclusion suitability, and study methodologies were evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for observational studies and the modified Jadad Scoring Scale for randomized controlled trials. Ultimately, six studies published between 2002 and 2019, involving 869 participants, were included in the review. RESULTS: Out of the 6 fin. l papers selected, 5 were randomized trials, and 1 was a prospective study. Megestrol acetate (800 mg/d) proved to be more effective than dronabinol 2.5 mg twice a day in increasing appetite. Nabilone (at a dosage of 0.5 mg per day) did not show superiority over placebo in alleviating symptoms such as pain, nausea, loss of appetite, and weight. However, with a double dosage followed by 1.0 mg/6 weeks, after eight weeks of treatment, patients recorded a significant increase in calorie intake and carbohydrate consumption compared to the placebo group, with some patients also experiencing substantial weight gain. Regarding delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a weight increase of ≥10% was observed in 17.6% of patients with doses of 5 mg or 10 mg capsules daily, without significant side effects. Additionally, patients treated with THC 2.5 mg reported improved chemosensory perception and increased appetite before meals compared to placebo. No significant side effects were reported in older adults taking cannabinoids. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabinoids offer promise in enhancing the quality of life for older individuals with active neoplastic disease. However, to establish comprehensive guidelines, further research with larger sample sizes is essential. Only through this approach can we fully grasp the potential and application of cannabinoids in addressing the nutritional concerns associated with neoplastic diseases.",

If a cure is not possible, the aim of drug therapy is to alleviate the symptoms to such an extent that the patient no longer has any restrictions in everyday life. However, around 20% of the approximately 100,000 medicines licensed in Germany have traffic-relevant side effects that can also lead to driving impairment.It is assumed that the effect of a drug is at least partially responsible for one in four traffic accidents and that one in ten victims of fatal road accidents has taken psychotropic drugs before driving. In addition to alcohol and drugs, medications from the benzodiazepine, opioid, and antidepressant groups are suspected of impairing driving safety in particular. The effects of these substances on young people have been described many times, but this review deals specifically with the traffic-relevant (side) effects of various classes of drugs on elderly people (aged 65 and over).Older people in particular often have to take different medications, which are metabolized differently compared to younger people due to underlying diseases and can also interact with each other. It was found that (1) older people often react more sensitively to substances, (2) not all representatives of a drug class have the same effect on driving safety, and (3) a general assessment of a drug's safety is not possible, since the effects also depend on other factors such as underlying diseases, treatment regimen, and the time of day the medication is taken.",

      "abstract": "The forensic analysis of amide-based synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) in seized materials is routinely performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS); however, a major challenge associated with GC-MS is the thermolytic degradation of substances with sensitive functional groups. Herein, we report the comprehensive thermal degradation and ester transformation of amide-based SCs, such as AB-FUBINACA, AB-CHMINACA, and MAB-CHMINACA, during GC-MS analysis and their treatment with analyte protectants (APs). These SCs were found to undergo thermolytic degradation during GC-MS in the presence of non-alcohol solvents. Using methanol as an injection solvent resulted in the conversion of the amide group to an ester group, producing other SCs such as AMB-FUBINACA, MA-CHMINACA, and MDMB-CHMINACA. Degradant and ester product formation has been interpreted as the adsorption of target SCs on glass wool via hydrogen bonding interactions between the active silanol and amide groups of the SCs, followed by an addition and/or elimination process. The factors found to influence the thermal degradation and/or esterification of the amide functional group include residence time, activity of glass wool, and injection volume. This report presents the fragmentation patterns of all compounds that were produced by degradation and esterification. Using 0.5 % sorbitol (AP) in MeOH as an injection solvent resulted in complete protection and improvement of the chromatographic shape of the compounds. This method has been successfully confirmed in terms of sensitivity, linearity, accuracy, and precision for standard solutions and tablet extraction using 0.5 % sorbitol in MeOH. Using AP increased the sensitivity by ten times or more compared to the use of only MeOH. The limit of detection for all analytes was determined as 25 ng/mL, and the calibration curves were linear over the concentration range of 50-2000 ng/mL. The values of accuracy error were below 11 %, and precision was less than 13 %. The effects of phytochemicals of herbal products, tablet ingredients, and biological matrices on the degradation and/or esterification and APs performance have also been evaluated in this work.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The usage of nicotine and cannabinoids has rapidly grown in popularity, leading to increased research into how they can affect people's health, both positively and negatively. Nicotine, Cannabidiol (CBD), and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) have been shown to have significant effects on cytokine function and inflammatory response. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to review and summarize the current literature on the effects of nicotine and cannabinoids on cytokines, including interleukins, TNF, IFN, and TGF-β. METHODS: Literature search was conducted on Medline/PubMed electronic databases utilizing the search terms \"nicotine\" OR \"cannabis\" OR \"cannabinoids\" AND \"cytokine\" AND \"inflammation\" AND \"stress\" AND \"immune\" from 11/1973 to 02/2024. RESULTS: THC and CBD usage have been associated with conflicting impacts on immune response, and observed to both exacerbate and inhibit inflammation. Nicotine has been shown to be generally proinflammatory with regards to cytokines. These responses have been reported to have significant effects on bodily response to inflammation-related diseases. Nicotine usage is associated with worsened outcomes for some conditions, like chronic pain, but improved outcomes for others, like arthritis. The impacts of cannabinoid usage tend to be more positive, exerting anti-inflammatory effects across a wide range of diseases. Given the widespread usage of these substances, it is important to understand the nature of their consequences on immune functions and the underlying mechanisms by which they act. CONCLUSION: This review has covered how cannabinoids and nicotine affect inflammation directly and how these effects can be attributed to the treatment of inflammatory diseases. In summary, the existing research studying the effects of cannabinoids and nicotine supports the major relationship between nicotine and cannabis use and inflammatory diseases.",

      "abstract": "Cholesterol is crucial for the proper functioning of eukaryotic cells, especially neurons, which rely on cholesterol to maintain their complex structure and facilitate synaptic transmission. However, brain cells are isolated from peripheral cholesterol by the blood-brain barrier and mature neurons primarily uptake the cholesterol synthesized by astrocytes for proper function. This study aimed to investigate the effect of aging on cholesterol trafficking in astrocytes and its delivery to neurons. We found that aged astrocytes accumulated high levels of cholesterol in the lysosomal compartment, and this cholesterol buildup can be attributed to the simultaneous occurrence of two events: decreased levels of the ABCA1 transporter, which impairs ApoE-cholesterol export from astrocytes, and reduced expression of NPC1, which hinders cholesterol release from lysosomes. We show that these two events are accompanied by increased microR-33 in aged astrocytes, which targets ABCA1 and NPC1. In addition, we demonstrate that the microR-33 increase is triggered by oxidative stress, one of the hallmarks of aging. By coculture experiments, we show that cholesterol accumulation in astrocytes impairs the cholesterol delivery from astrocytes to neurons. Remarkably, we found that this altered transport of cholesterol could be alleviated through treatment with endocannabinoids as well as cannabidiol or CBD. Finally, according to data demonstrating that aged astrocytes develop an A1 phenotype, we found that cholesterol buildup is also observed in reactive C3+ astrocytes. Given that reduced neuronal cholesterol affects synaptic plasticity, the ability of cannabinoids to restore cholesterol transport from aged astrocytes to neurons holds significant implications in aging and inflammation.",

      "abstract": "Concerns have been raised about synthetic cannabinoids (SCs), which are among the most often trafficked and used illegal substances. An analytical method that holds promise for determining illicit drug use in the general population is wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). Unfortunately, the concentration of SCs in wastewater is often extremely low on account of their hydrophobic nature, thus presenting a significant obstacle to the accurate detection and quantification of SCs using WBE. In this study, we present novel magnetic nanomaterials as amphiphilic adsorbents for pretreatment of wastewater using magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE). Polydopamine-modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles were used as the magnetic core and further functionalized with poly(divinylbenzene-N-vinylpyrrolidone). Coupled with UHPLC-MS/MS analysis, an analytical method to simultaneously detect nine SCs at trace-levels in wastewater was developed and validated, enriching 50 mL wastewater to 100 μL with limits of detection (LOD) being 0.005-0.5 ng L-1, limits of quantification (LOQ) being 0.01-1.0 ng L-1, recoveries ranging from 73.99 to 110.72%, and the intra- and inter-day precision's relative standard deviations less than 15%. In comparison to the time-consuming conventional column-based solid phase extraction, the entire MSPE procedure from sample pre-treatment to data acquisition could be finished in one hour, thus largely facilitating the WBE method for drug surveillance and control.",

Medical Cannabis popularity has surged since its legal regulation growing around the world. Numerous promising discoveries bring more data on cannabinoids' pharmacological characteristics and therapeutic applications. Given the current surge in interest in the medical use of cannabinoids, there is an urgent need for an effective method of their administration. Surpassing low bioavailability, low water solubility, and instability became an important milestone in the advancement of cannabinoids in pharmaceutical applications. The numerous uses of cannabinoids in clinical practice remain restricted by limited administration alternatives, but there is hope when biodegradable polymers are taken into account. The primary objective of this review is to highlight the wide range of indications for which cannabinoids may be used, as well as the polymeric carriers that enhance their effectiveness. The current review described a wide range of therapeutic applications of cannabinoids, including pain management, neurological and sleep disorders, anxiety, and cancer treatment. The use of these compounds was further examined in the area of dermatology and cosmetology. Finally, with the use of biodegradable polymer-based drug delivery systems (DDSs), it was demonstrated that cannabinoids can be delivered specifically to the intended site while also improving the drug's physicochemical properties, emphasizing their utility. Nevertheless, additional clinical trials on novel cannabinoids' formulations are required, as their full spectrum therapeutical potential is yet to be unravelled.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Genes related to MAPK-ERK signaling pathways, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition induction is evolutionarily conserved and has crucial roles in the regulation of important cellular processes, including cell proliferation. In this study, six cannabinoids from Cannabis sativa were docked with MAPK-ERK signaling pathways to identify their possible binding interactions. The results showed that all the cannabinoids have good binding affinities with the target proteins. The best binding affinities were MEK- tetrahydrocannabinol (- 8.8 kcal/mol) and P13k-cannabinol (- 8.5 kcal/mol). The root mean square deviation was calculated and used two alternative variants (rmsd/ub and rmsd/lb) and the values of rmsd/lb fluctuated 8.6-2.0 Å and for rmsd/ub from 1.0 to 2.0 Å that suggests the cannabinoids and protein complex are accurate and cannot destroy on binding. The study analyzed the pharmacokinetic and drug-likeness properties of six cannabinoids from C. sativa leaves using the SwissADME web tool. Lipinski's rule of five was used to predict drug-likeness and showed that all compounds have not violated it and the total polar surface area of cannabinoids was also according to Lipinski's rule that is benchmarked of anticancer drugs. Cannabinoids are meet the requirements of leadlikeness and synthetic accessibility values showed they can be synthesized. The molecular weight, XLOGP3, solubility (log S), and flexibility (FLEX) are according to the bioavailability radar. The bioavailability score and consensus Log Po/w fall within the acceptable range for the suitable drug. Pharmacokinetics parameters showed that cannabinoids cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, have high GI absorption as well as cannabinoids are substrates of (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4) but no substrate of P-glycoprotein. Based on these findings, the study suggests that cannabinoids are suitable drugs that could be used as effective inhibitors for target proteins involved in cancer pathways. Among the six cannabinoids, cannabinol and tetrahydrocannabinol exerted maximum binding affinities with proteins of MAPK-ERK signaling pathways, and their pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness-related profiles suggest that these cannabinoids could be superlative inhibitors in cancer treatment. Further in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies are needed to explore their potential in cancer treatment.

      "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD), one of the main Cannabis sativa bioactive compounds, is utilized in the treatment of major epileptic syndromes. Its efficacy can be attributed to a multimodal mechanism of action that includes, as potential targets, several types of ion channels. In the brain, CBD reduces the firing frequency in rat hippocampal neurons, partly prolonging the duration of action potentials, suggesting a potential blockade of voltage-operated K+ channels. We postulate that this effect might involve the inhibition of the large-conductance voltage- and Ca2+-operated K+ channel (BK channel), which plays a role in the neuronal action potential's repolarization. Thus, we assessed the impact of CBD on the BK channel activity, heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells. Our findings, using the patch-clamp technique, revealed that CBD inhibits BK channel currents in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 280 nM. The inhibition is through a direct interaction, reducing both the unitary conductance and voltage-dependent activation of the channel. Additionally, the cannabinoid significantly delays channel activation kinetics, indicating stabilization of the closed state. These effects could explain the changes induced by CBD in action potential shape and duration, and they may contribute to the observed anticonvulsant activity of this cannabinoid.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The opioid epidemic is a public health crisis affecting spine care and pain management. Medical marijuana is a potential nonopioid analgesic yet to be studied in the surgical setting since its effects on bone healing are not fully understood. Studies have demonstrated analgesic and potentially osteoinductive properties of cannabinoids with endocannabinoid receptor expression in bone tissue. PURPOSE: We hypothesize that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) will not decrease bone healing in spinal fusion. STUDY DESIGN: Seventy-eight adult Sprague-Dawley rats were used for this study. Utilizing allogenic bone grafts (6 donor rats), posterolateral inter-transverse lumbar fusion at the L4-L5 level was performed. The animals were equally divided into four treatment groups, each receiving 0.1 ml intraperitoneal injections weekly as follows: placebo (saline), 5 mg/kg THC, 5 mg/kg CBD, and a combination of 5 mg/kg THC and 5mg/kg CBD (Combo). METHODS: Callus tissue was harvested 2- and 8-weeks postsurgery for qPCR assessment to quantify changes in the expression of osteogenic genes. Manual palpation was done to assess the strength of the L4-L5 arthrodesis on all rats. μCT image-based callus analysis and histology were performed. One-way ANOVA followed by post hoc comparisons was performed. RESULTS: μCT demonstrated no significant differences. Treatment groups had slightly increased bone volume and density compared to control. qPCR at 2 weeks indicated downregulated RANKL/OPG ratios skewing towards osteogenesis in the CBD group, with the THC and CBD+THC groups demonstrating a downward trend (p>.05). ALPL, BMP4, and SOST were significantly higher in the CBD group, with CTNNB1 and RUNX2 also showing an upregulating trend. The CBD group showed elevation in Col1A1 and MMP13. Data at eight weeks showed ALPL, RUNX2, BMP4, and SOST were downregulated for all treatment groups. In the CBD+THC group, RANK, RANKL, and OPG were downregulated. OPG downregulation reached significance for the THC and CBD+THC group compared to saline. Interestingly, the RANKL/OPG ratio showed upregulation in the CBD and CBD+THC groups. RANKL showed upregulation in the CBD group. At 2 and 8 weeks, the CBD treatment group showed superior histological progression, increasing between time points. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that CBD and THC have no adverse effect on bone healing and the rate of spinal fusion in rats. Osteogenic factors were upregulated in the CBD-treated groups at 2 weeks, which indicates a potential for bone regeneration. In this group, compared to control, the RANKL/OPG ratio at the early healing phase demonstrates the inhibition of osteoclast differentiation, enhancing bone formation. Interestingly, it shows promoted osteoclast differentiation at the later healing phase, enhancing bone remodeling. This aligns with the physiological expectation of a lower ratio in the early phases and a higher ratio in the later remodeling phases. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: CBD and THC showed no inhibitory effects on bone healing in a spinal fusion model. Moreover, histologic and gene expression analysis demonstrated that CBD may, in fact, enhance bone healing. Further research is needed to confirm the safe usage of THC and CBD in the postoperative setting following spinal fusions.",

      "abstract": "Despite decades of rigorous research and numerous clinical trials, Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as a notable healthcare challenge of this century, with effective therapeutic solutions remaining elusive. Recently, the endocannabinoid system (ECS) has emerged as an essential therapeutic target due to its regulatory role in different physiological processes, such as neuroprotection, modulation of inflammation, and synaptic plasticity. This aligns with previous research showing that cannabinoid receptor ligands have the potential to trigger the functional structure of neuronal and brain networks, potentially impacting memory processing. Therefore, our study aims to assess the effects of prolonged, intermittent exposure (over 90 days) to JWH-133 (0.2 mg/kg) and an EU-GMP certified Cannabis sativa L. (Cannabixir® Medium Flos, 2.5 mg/kg) on recognition memory, as well as their influence on brain metabolism and modulation of the expanded endocannabinoid system in APP/PS1 mice. Chronic therapy with cannabinoid receptor ligands resulted in reduced anxiety-like behavior and partially reversed the cognitive deficits. Additionally, a reduction was observed in both the number and size of Aβ plaque deposits, along with decreased cerebral glucose metabolism, as well as a decline in the expression of mTOR and CB2 receptors. Furthermore, the study revealed enlarged astrocytes and enhanced expression of M1 mAChR in mice subjected to cannabinoid treatment. Our findings highlight the pivotal involvement of the extended endocannabinoid system in cognitive decline and pathological aspects associated with AD, presenting essential preclinical evidence to support the continued exploration and assessment of cannabinoid receptor ligands for AD treatment."

      "abstract": "The endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS) plays a critical role in the regulation of various physiological functions, including sleep, mood, and neuroinflammation. Phytocannabinoids such as Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinomimimetics, and some N-acylethanolamides, particularly palmitoyethanolamide, have emerged as potential therapeutic agents for the management of sleep disorders. THC, the psychoactive component of cannabis, may initially promote sleep, but, in the long term, alters sleep architecture, while CBD shows promise in improving sleep quality without psychoactive effects. Clinical studies suggest that CBD modulates endocannabinoid signaling through several receptor sites, offering a multifaceted approach to sleep regulation. Similarly, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), in addition to interacting with the endocannabinoid system, acts as an agonist on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). The favorable safety profile of CBD and PEA and the potential for long-term use make them an attractive alternative to conventional pharmacotherapy. The integration of the latter two compounds into comprehensive treatment strategies, together with cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), represents a holistic approach to address the multifactorial nature of sleep disorders. Further research is needed to establish the optimal dosage, safety, and efficacy in different patient populations, but the therapeutic potential of CBD and PEA offers hope for improved sleep quality and general well-being.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: Acute pain management remains a challenge and postoperative pain is often undermanaged despite many available treatment options, also including cannabinoids. RECENT FINDINGS: In the light of the opioid epidemic, there has been growing interest in alternative care bundles for pain management, including cannabinoids as potential treatment to decrease opioid prescribing. Despite the lack of solid evidence on the efficacy of cannabinoids, their use among patients with pain, including those using opioids, is currently increasing. This use is supported by data suggesting that cannabinoids could potentially contribute to a better pain management and to a reduction in opioid doses while maintaining effective analgesia with minimum side effects. The scientific basis for supporting the use of cannabis is extensive, although it does not necessarily translate into relevant clinical outcomes. The use of cannabinoids in acute pain did not always consistently show statistically significant results in improving acute pain. Large randomized, controlled trials evaluating diverse cannabis extracts are needed in different clinical pain populations to determine safety and efficacy.",

      "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a serious threat to human, animal, and plant health on a global scale. Search and elimination techniques should be used to effectively counter the spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. With only a few novel drugs in clinical development, the quest for plant-based alternatives to prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance among bacteria has accelerated. Treatment of MRSA infections is challenging owing to rapidly emerging resistance mechanisms coupled with their protective biofilms. In the present research, we examined the antibacterial properties of ten plant-derived ethanolic leaf extracts. The most effective ethanolic leaf extract against MRSA in decreasing order of zone of inhibition, Cannabis sativa L. > Syzygium cumini > Murraya koenigii > Eucalyptus sp. > while Aloe barbadensis, Azadirachta indica, had very little impact. Mangifera indica, Curcuma longa, Tinospora cordifolia, and Carica papaya did not exhibit inhibitory effects against MRSA; hence, Cannabis was selected for further experimental study. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Cannabis sativa L. extract was 0.25 mg ml-1 with 86% mortality. At a sub-MIC dosage of 0.125 mg ml-1, the biofilm formation was reduced by 71%. The two major cannabinoids detected were cannabidiol and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), which were majorly attributed to substantial inhibitory action against MRSA. The time-kill kinetics demonstrated a bactericidal action at 4 MIC over an 8-20-h time window with a 90% reduction in growth rate. The results from SEM, and light microscopy Giemsa staining revealed a reduction in cells in the treated group with increased AKP activity, indicating bacterial cell membrane breakdown. These findings suggested cannabinoids may be a promising alternative to antibiotic therapy for bovine biofilm-associated MRSA.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of SCs consumption by assessing the effects of three novel synthetic cannabinoids (SCs); MDMB-CHMINACA, 5F-ADB-PINACA, and APICA post-drug treatment. SCs are known for their rapid onset (<1 min) and prolonged duration (≥5 h). Therefore, this research aimed to assess behavioral responses and their correlation with endocannabinoids (ECs) accumulation in the hippocampus, and EC's metabolic enzymes alteration at different timeframes (1-3-5-h) following drug administration. Different extents of locomotive disruption and sustained anxiety-like symptoms were observed throughout all-encompassing timeframes of drug administration. Notably, MDMB-CHMINACA induced significant memory impairment at 1 and 3 h. Elevated levels of anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) were detected 1 h post-MDMB-CHMINACA and 5F-ADB-PINACA administration. Reduced mRNA expression levels of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) (AEA and 2-AG degrading enzymes, respectively), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) occurred at 1 h, with FAAH levels remaining reduced at 3 h. These findings suggest a connection between increased EC content and decreased BDNF expression following SC exposure. Cognitive disruption, particularly motor coordination decline and progressive loss manifested in a time-dependent manner across all the analyzed SCs. Our study highlights the importance of adopting a temporal framework when assessing the effects of SCs.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the medical use of cannabinoids has attracted growing attention worldwide. In particular, anti-inflammatory properties of cannabinoids led to their emergence as potential therapeutic options for autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. Recent studies have also shown that cannabinoid receptors are widely expressed and have endogenous ligands in the skin, suggesting that the skin has its own endocannabinoid system. The aim of this review is to discuss the potential therapeutic effects of cannabinoids in autoimmune and inflammatory skin diseases. Following an overview of cannabinoids and the endocannabinoid system, we describe the cellular and molecular mechanisms of cannabinoids in skin health and disease. We then review the clinical studies of cannabinoids in autoimmune and inflammatory skin diseases including systemic sclerosis (SSc), dermatomyositis (DM), psoriasis (Pso) and atopic dermatitis (AD). A primary literature search was conducted in July 2023, using PubMed and Web of Science. A total of 15 articles were included after excluding reviews, non-human studies and in vitro studies from 389 non-duplicated articles. Available evidence suggests that cannabinoids may be beneficial for SSc, DM, Pso and AD. However, further studies, ideally randomized controlled trials, are needed to further evaluate the use of cannabinoids in autoimmune and inflammatory skin diseases.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The elevation of endocannabinoid levels through inhibiting their degradation afforded neuroprotection in CaMKIIα-TDP-43 mice, a conditional transgenic model of frontotemporal dementia. However, which cannabinoid receptors are mediating these benefits is still pending to be elucidated. METHODS: We have investigated the involvement of the CB1 and the CB2 receptor using chronic treatments with selective ligands in CaMKIIα-TDP-43 mice, analysis of their cognitive deterioration with the Novel Object Recognition test, and immunostaining for neuronal and glial markers in two areas of interest in frontotemporal dementia. RESULTS: Our results confirmed the therapeutic value of activating either the CB1 or the CB2 receptor, with improvements in the animal performance in the Novel Object Recognition test, preservation of pyramidal neurons, in particular in the medial prefrontal cortex, and attenuation of glial reactivity, in particular in the hippocampus. In addition, the activation of both CB1 and CB2 receptors reduced the elevated levels of TDP-43 in the medial prefrontal cortex of CaMKIIα-TDP-43 mice, an effect exerted by mechanisms that are currently under investigation. CONCLUSIONS: These data reinforce the notion that the activation of CB1 and CB2 receptors may represent a promising therapy against TDP-43-induced neuropathology in frontotemporal dementia. Future studies will have to confirm these benefits, in particular with one of the selective CB2 agonists used here, which has been thoroughly characterized for clinical development.",
