      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD) is a complication of long-term PN use, attributed to the use of ω-6 injectable lipid emulsions (ILE). Fish oil (FO) ILE have been successful in reversing liver injury in neonates. Evidence for pure FO ILE use in adult patients is limited. METHODS: Case series of the use of FO lipid emulsions in adults with IFALD from the University of Chicago PN registry. Analysis of medical charts and PN formulations was performed. RESULTS: Three cases of IFALD treated with FO ILE were identified. The first case was a 30-year-old man with short bowel syndrome (SBS), hyperbilirubinemia, and biopsy-proven IFALD. Following a change from a soy lipid emulsion to FO lipid emulsion, his liver tests rapidly improved and remained stable over 202 weeks of use. The second case was a 76-year-old woman with intestinal failure (IF) due to a frozen bowel. A change from a soy ILE to a composite lipid and later to a pure FO ILE did not result in improvement in her liver tests. The third case was a 28-year-old man with SBS and biopsy-proven IFALD. Change to a composite ILE and subsequently FO lipid emulsion resulted in a gradual improvement in liver tests. No clinical essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiencies were identified during treatment. CONCLUSION: FO ILE may be effective in the treatment of adult patients with cholestatic IFALD. Use is safe with no EFA deficiencies detected in up to 4 years of use.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress and inflammation, as natural parts of metabolic adaptations during the transition from late gestation to early lactation, are critical indicators of dairy cows' metabolic health. This study was designed to investigate the effects of abomasal infusion of essential fatty acids (EFA), particularly α-linolenic acid, and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on plasma, erythrocyte, and liver markers of oxidative stress in dairy cows during the transition period. Rumen-cannulated German Holstein cows (n = 38) in their second lactation (11,101 ± 1,118 kg milk/305 d, mean ± standard deviation) were abomasally infused with one of the following treatments from d -63 antepartum until d 63 postpartum (PP): CTRL (n = 9; 76 g/d coconut oil); EFA (n = 9; 78 g/d linseed plus 4 g/d safflower oil); CLA (n = 10; isomers cis-9,trans-11 and trans-10,cis-12 CLA; 38 g/d); and EFA+CLA (n = 10; 120 g/d). Hematological parameters as well as markers of oxidative status were measured in plasma, erythrocytes, and liver before and after calving. Immunohematological parameters, including erythrocyte number, hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, leukocytes, and basophils, were affected by time, and their peak levels were observed on the day after calving. The oxidative stress markers glutathione peroxidase 1 and reactive oxygen metabolites in plasma and erythrocytes were both affected by time, exhibiting the highest levels on d 1 PP, whereas β-carotene, retinol, and tocopherol were at their lowest levels at the same time. Immunohematological parameters were only marginally affected by fatty acid treatment in a time-dependent manner. As such, lymphocyte and atypical lymphocyte counts were both significantly highest in the groups that received EFA at d 1 PP. Moreover, EFA supplementation increased the mean corpuscular volume and showed a trend for induction of mean corpuscular hemoglobin compared with the CLA group during the transition period. The PP mean thrombocyte volume was higher in the EFA than in the CLA group (except for d 28) and both EFA and CLA reduced number of thrombocytes and thrombocrit at distinct time points. Hepatic mRNA abundance of markers related to oxidative status, including glutathione peroxidase (GPX-1) and catalase (CAT), was lower (P < 0.05) in EFA-treated than non-EFA-treated cows at d 28 PP. Dairy cows at the onset of lactation were characterized by induced markers of both oxidative stress and inflammation. Supplementing EFA and CLA had minor and time-dependent effects on markers of oxidative stress in plasma, erythrocytes, and liver. A comparison of EFA supplementation with CLA or CTRL showed higher immunohematological response at d 1 PP and lower hepatic antioxidant levels by d 28 PP. Supplementation with EFA+CLA had only a minor effect on oxidative markers, which were more similar to those with the EFA treatment. Altogether, despite the time-dependent differences, the current findings show only minor effects of EFA and CLA supplementation in the prevention of early lactation-induced oxidative stress.",

      "abstract": "Bombyx mori is an ideal lepidopteran species representative of many scientific studies, a model of studies for medicine and a significant insect from an ecological standpoint. This review was performed to summarize the fatty acids (FA) composition of silkworm pupae (SP) that are associated with other important compounds that could add value to SP, diversifying the ways of valorization. The proposal to complete plant-based feeds with insect-based feeds represents a viable option to beneficially impact human and animal health and the environment. The quality and quantity of fats consumed significantly impact the aetiology of certain diseases. The key compounds of fat named essential FA (EFA) substantially influence the prevention and treatment of several diseases through their nutraceutical functions. Due to its excellent profile in nutrients such as protein and fat, amino acids and fatty acids composition, SP has become an important alternative feed ingredient and source of EFA. SP is a by-product that was discarded in large quantities. Following the need to act to improve human health and reduce climate change impact, many researchers focused on studying SP applications in the medical and agricultural industries. Several authors noticed an improvement in the health markers by using SP. The feed cost for the animal was reduced with economic implications. Minimization of environmental impact was recorded. Few precautions were recommended regarding SP use, although they should not be ignored. The composition of SP and its potential for use in various industries provides us with persuasive arguments for continuing to develop the sericulture industry."

      "abstract": "Egg biochemical composition is among the main factors affecting offspring quality and survival during the yolk-sac stage, when larvae depend exclusively on yolk nutrients. These nutrients are primarily embedded in the developing oocytes during vitellogenesis. In aquaculture, assisted reproduction procedures may be applied enabling gamete production. For the European eel (Anguilla anguilla), reproductive treatment involves administration of pituitary extracts from carp (CPE) or salmon (SPE) to induce and sustain vitellogenesis. In the present study, we compared the influence of CPE and SPE treatments on offspring quality and composition as well as nutrient utilization during the yolk-sac stage. Thus, dry weight, proximal composition (total lipid, total protein), free amino acids, and fatty acids were assessed in eggs and larvae throughout the yolk-sac stage, where body and oil-droplet area were measured to estimate growth rate, oil-droplet utilization, and oil-droplet utilization efficiency. The results showed that CPE females spawned eggs with higher lipid and free amino acid contents. However, SPE females produced more buoyant eggs with higher fertilization rate as well as larger larvae with more energy reserves (estimated as oil-droplet area). Overall, general patterns of nutrient utilization were detected, such as the amount of total lipid and monounsaturated fatty acids decreasing from the egg stage and throughout the yolk-sac larval stage. On the contrary, essential fatty acids and free amino acids were retained. Notably, towards the end of the yolk-sac stage, the proximal composition and biometry of surviving larvae, from both treatments, were similar.",

Four different percentages of dietary leaf extract powder of Aleo vera (ALE) with a basal feed, designated as, i.e., T0 (Control group; without ALE), T1 (1% ALE), T2 (2% ALE), and T3 (3% ALE). Fish fry was reared in concrete tanks (7.0 m, 1.6 m, 1.0: L, W, H; water volume 11.2 m3/tank), with an average initial weight 4.04 ± 0.03 g/ fry, and each treatment was triplicated. Fry was randomly distributed at a stocking rate of 450 individuals/ tanks. The water quality parameters revealed that temperature, pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO) and nitrates were found in a promising range as given by FAO/WHO limits. However, the record values obtained for Electric Conductivity (EC), Total dissolved solids (TDS), and alkalinities were not found in all tanks' suitable range according to FAO/WHO limits. The results revealed a significant impact of different percentages of dietary ALE supplementation on fry's body composition and haematological parameters. Moreover, the final body weight, final body length, average daily weight gain (g), net weight gain (g) and specific growth rate (%) were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in T1 and T2 compared with T0 and T3 treatments. The poorest feed conversion ratio was recorded in the T2 group compared with other treatments. Thus, the current study provides information about the nutritional quality of Nile tilapia culturing in Pakistan."

      "abstract": "This study aimed at investigating the synergistic effects of essential fatty acids (EFA) and conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) on the liver proteome profile of dairy cows during the transition to lactation. 16 Holstein cows were infused from 9 wk. antepartum to 9 wk. postpartum into the abomasum with either coconut oil (CTRL) or a mixture of EFA (linseed + safflower oil) and CLA (EFA + CLA). Label-free quantitative proteomics was performed in liver tissue biopsied at days -21, +1, +28, and + 63 relative to calving. Differentially abundant proteins (DAP) between treatment groups were identified at the intersection between a multivariate and a univariate analysis. In total, 1680 proteins were identified at each time point, of which between groups DAP were assigned to the metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, drug metabolism - cytochrome P450, steroid hormone biosynthesis, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and glutathione metabolism. Cytochrome P450, as a central hub, enriched with specific CYP enzymes comprising: CYP51A1 (d - 21), CYP1A1 & CYP4F2 (d + 28), and CYP4V2 (d + 63). Collectively, supplementation of EFA + CLA in transition cows impacted hepatic lipid metabolism and enriched several common biological pathways at all time points that were mainly related to ω-oxidation of fatty acids through the Cytochrome p450 pathway. SIGNIFICANCE: In three aspects this manuscript is notable. First, this is among the first longitudinal proteomics studies in nutrition of dairy cows. The selected time points are critical periods around parturition with profound endocrine and metabolic adaptations. Second, our findings provided novel information on key drivers of biologically relevant pathways suggested according to previously reported performance, zootechnical, and metabolism data (already published elsewhere). Third, our results revealed the role of cytochrome P450 that is hardly investigated, and of ω-oxidation pathways in the metabolism of fatty acids with the involvement of specific enzymes.",

      "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, is a common childhood disorder with a prevalence rate of 5-10%. There have been many theories proposed to explain ADHD, and one of them focuses on the deficiency of essential fatty acids (EFA), particularly omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Studies have shown that there is a positive correlation between EFA deficiency severity and ADHD symptoms, and a negative association between blood PUFAs levels and ADHD symptoms. Moreover, clinical studies have shown a promising effect of n-3 PUFAs in the treatment of both clinical and cognitive symptoms in children with ADHD. In addition, with the more relatively safe and tolerable properties of n-3 PUFAs when comparing with the standard pharmacotherapy, n-3 PUFAs may be a potential treatment option for children with ADHD. Of note, the association between n-3 PUFAs deficiency and ADHD has been suggested to involve several biological systems, including inflammation, dysregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the autonomic nervous system (ANS), and an imbalanced gut-microbiota axis (GBA). Thus, the biomarkers from these biological systems may serve as possible treatment response predictors of n-3 PUFAs in children with ADHD."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pegvaliase is an enzyme substitution therapy that reduces blood phenylalanine (Phe) in adults with phenylketonuria (PKU), and often allows normalization of protein intake (≥0.8 g protein/kg). Here we examine the nutrition status of adults with PKU consuming a normal protein intake without medical food after being treated with pegvaliase for ≥1 year. METHODS: A cross-sectional study evaluating nutritional intake (3-day food record and food frequency questionnaire), anthropometrics, laboratory indices of protein, micronutrient, and essential fatty acid (EFA) status, and questionnaires evaluating food neophobia and Epicurean eating pleasure. RESULTS: Participants (n = 18, 61% female) started pegvaliase 4.9 ± 2.1 years prior to enrollment and were aged 38.2 ± 8.8 years with a mean BMI of 29.2 ± 4.1 kg/m2. Participants consumed a mean of 73.2 ± 17.6 g protein/d (1.0 ± 0.3 g/kg/d). Eleven participants had low blood Phe (<30 μmol/L) with adequate protein intake and normal indices of protein status. Micronutrient and EFA concentrations were normal except for mildly low vitamin D (<30 ng/mL, n = 12). Intakes of sodium, saturated fat, and added sugars exceeded recommendations for healthy adults, though mean diet quality was comparable to a US adult reference population. Lower food neophobia scores correlated with an increased aesthetic appreciation of food. However, 53% of participants self-reported having moderate (n = 6) to high (n = 3) food neophobia. DISCUSSION: Participants treated with pegvaliase consumed an unrestricted diet with adequate dietary protein and, overall, had normal protein, micronutrient, and fatty acid status. Despite low blood Phe, protein nutriture was not compromised. While nutritional deficiencies were not identified, diet quality was suboptimal and some participants reported food neophobia. Nutrition education remains an important component of care as patients adapt to a normal diet.",

Eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have antibacterial and inflammation-resolving effects in tuberculosis (TB). However, whether switching to a diet with optimum n-3 EFA intake after the infection has comparable benefits has not been investigated. We aimed to compare the effects of a diet with sufficient n-3 EFA content in an acceptable n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio for rodents ((n-3)eFAS group) with those on the same diet supplemented with EPA and DHA (EPA/DHA group) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-infected C3HeB/FeJ mice with a low n-3 PUFA status. Mice were conditioned on an n-3 PUFA-deficient diet with a high n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio for 6 weeks before Mtb infection and randomized to either (n-3)eFAS or EPA/DHA diets 1 week post-infection for 3 weeks. At endpoint, EPA and DHA compositions were higher and arachidonic acid, osbond acid, and total n-6 LCPUFAs lower in all lipid pools measured in the EPA/DHA group (all P < 0.001). Percentage body weight gain was higher (P = 0.017) and lung bacterial load lower (P < 0.001) in the EPA/DHA group. Additionally, the EPA/DHA group had a more pro-resolving lung lipid mediator profile and lower lung in IL-1α and IL-1β concentrations (P = 0.023, P = 0.049). Inverse correlations were found between the lung and peripheral blood mononuclear cell EPA and DHA and selected pro-inflammatory cytokines. These are the first findings that indicate that EPA/DHA supplementation provides benefits superior to a diet with sufficient n-3 EFAs concerning bacterial killing, weight gain and lung inflammation resolution in Mtb-infected mice with a low n-3 PUFA status. Therefore, EPA and DHA may be worth considering as adjunct TB treatment.",

      "abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that the maternal supply of essential fatty acids (EFA), especially α-linolenic acid, and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), affects glucose metabolism, the endocrine regulation of energy metabolism and growth, and the intestinal development of neonatal calves. We studied calves from dams that received an abomasal infusion of 76 g/d coconut oil (CTRL; n = 9), 78 g/d linseed oil and 4 g/d safflower oil (EFA; n = 9), 38 g/d Lutalin (BASF SE) containing 27% cis-9,trans-11 and trans-10,cis-12 CLA (CLA; n = 9), or a combination of EFA and CLA (EFA+CLA; n = 11) during the last 63 d of gestation and early lactation. Calves received colostrum and transition milk from their own dam for the first 5 d of life. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, leptin, and adiponectin concentrations were measured in milk. Blood samples were taken before first colostrum intake, 24 h after birth, and from d 3 to 5 of life before morning feeding to measure metabolic and endocrine traits in plasma. On d 3 of life, energy expenditure was evaluated by a bolus injection of NaH13CO3 and determination of CO2 appearance rate. On d 4, additional blood samples were taken to evaluate glucose first-pass uptake and 13CO2 enrichment after [13C6]-glucose feeding and intravenous [6,6-2H2]-glucose bolus injection, as well as postprandial changes in glucose, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), insulin, and glucagon. On d 5, calves were killed 2 h after feeding and samples of small intestinal mucosa were taken for histomorphometric measurements. The concentrations of IGF-I, adiponectin, and leptin in milk decreased during early lactation in all groups, and the concentrations of leptin in first colostrum was higher in EFA than in CTRL cows. Plasma glucose concentration before first colostrum intake was higher in EFA calves than in non-EFA calves and was lower in CLA calves than in non-CLA calves. Plasma IGF-I concentration was higher on d 1 before colostrum intake in EFA calves than in EFA+CLA calves and indicated an overall CLA effect, with lower plasma IGF-I in CLA than in non-CLA calves. Postprandial NEFA concentration was lowest in EFA and CLA calves. The postprandial rise in plasma insulin was higher in EFA than in non-EFA calves. Plasma adiponectin concentration increased from d 1 to d 2 in all groups and was higher on d 3 in CLA than in non-CLA calves. Plasma leptin concentration was higher on d 4 and 5 in EFA than in non-EFA calves. Maternal fatty acid treatment did not affect energy expenditure and first-pass glucose uptake, but glucose uptake on d 4 was faster in EFA than in non-EFA calves. Crypt depth was lower, and the ratio of villus height to crypt depth was higher in the ilea of CLA than non-CLA calves. Elevated plasma glucose and IGF-I in EFA calves immediately after birth may indicate an improved energetic status in calves when dams are supplemented with EFA. Maternal EFA and CLA supplementation influenced postprandial metabolic changes and affected factors related to the neonatal insulin response.",

      "abstract": "Sufficient glucose availability is crucial for exploiting the genetic potential of milk production during early lactation, and endocrine changes are mainly related to repartitioning of nutrient supplies toward the mammary gland. Long-chain fatty acids, such as essential fatty acids (EFA) and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), have the potential to improve negative energy balance and modify endocrine changes. In the present study, the hypothesis that combined CLA and EFA treatment supports glucose metabolism around the time of calving and stimulates insulin action and the somatotropic axis in cows in an additive manner was tested. Rumen-cannulated German Holstein cows (n = 40) were investigated from wk 9 antepartum (AP) until wk 9 postpartum (PP). The cows were abomasally supplemented with coconut oil (CTRL, 76 g/d); 78 g/d of linseed and 4 g/d of safflower oil (EFA); Lutalin (CLA, isomers cis-9,trans-11 and trans-10,cis-12 CLA, each 10 g/d); or the combination of EFA+CLA. Blood samples were collected several times AP and PP to determine the concentrations of plasma metabolites and hormones related to glucose metabolism and the somatotropic axis. Liver tissue samples were collected several days AP and PP to measure glycogen concentration and the mRNA abundance of genes related to gluconeogenesis and the somatotropic axis. On d 28 AP and 21 PP, endogenous glucose production (eGP) and glucose oxidation (GOx) were measured via tracer technique. The concentration of plasma glucose was higher in CLA than in non-CLA-treated cows, and the plasma β-hydroxybutyrate concentration was higher in EFA than in non-EFA cows on d 21 PP. The eGP increased from AP to PP with elevated eGP in EFA and decreased eGP in CLA-treated cows; GOx was lower in CLA than in CTRL on d 21 PP. The plasma insulin concentration decreased after calving in all groups and was higher in CLA than in non-CLA cows at several time points. Plasma glucagon and cortisol concentrations on d 21 PP were lower in CLA than non-CLA groups. The glucagon/insulin and glucose/insulin ratios were higher in CTRL than in CLA group during the transition period. Plasma IGF-I concentration was lower in EFA than non-EFA cows on d 42 AP and was higher during the dry period and early lactation in CLA than in non-CLA cows. The IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-3/-2 ratio in blood plasma was higher in CLA than in non-CLA cows. Hepatic glycogen concentration on d 28 PP was higher, but the mRNA abundance of PC and IGFBP2 was lower in CLA than non-CLA cows on d 1 PP. The EFA treatment decreased the mRNA abundance of IGFBP3 AP and PCK1, PCK2, G6PC, PCCA, HMGCS2, IGFBP2, and INSR at several time points PP. Results indicated elevated concentrations of plasma glucose and insulin along with the stimulation of the somatotropic axis in cows treated with CLA, whereas EFA treatment stimulated eGP but not mRNA abundance related to eGP PP. The systemic effects of the combined EFA+CLA treatment were very similar to those of CLA treatment, but the effects on hepatic gene expression partially corresponded to those of EFA treatment.",

METHODS: Thus, a survey was developed with the purpose of evaluating current nutrition practices of CF-focused gastroenterologists, specifically utilizing awardees and mentors of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) Developing Innovative GastroEnterology Specialty Training (DIGEST) Program. Topics included appetite stimulation, tube feeding (TF), and aspects of nutrition assessment, specifically urine sodium and essential fatty acid (EFA) status. RESULTS: The response rate was 61% (22/36). About half (55%; 12/22) of respondents had 5-10 years of experience in GI, and 23% (5/22) had >10 years. In regard to appetite stimulation, the majority used cyproheptadine; however, duration and pattern of prescribing varied. Variation was noted in TF management pertaining to tube placement, formula choice, and prescribing pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy with overnight TF. The majority did not check EFAs or urine sodium. Treatment for deficiencies in EFA or abnormal urine sodium was inconsistent. CONCLUSION: The survey reveals wide variation in management of some aspects of nutrition-related manifestations of CF among experienced providers. This reflects the need for research to provide evidence-based guidelines.",

      "abstract": "Dairy cows are exposed to increased inflammatory processes in the transition period from late pregnancy to early lactation. Essential fatty acids (EFA) and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) are thought to modulate the inflammatory response in dairy cows. The present study investigated the effects of a combined EFA and CLA infusion on the fatty acid (FA) status in plasma lipids, and whether changes in the FA pattern were associated with the acute phase and inflammatory response during late pregnancy and early lactation. Rumen-cannulated Holstein cows (n = 40) were assigned from wk 9 antepartum to wk 9 postpartum to 1 of 4 treatment groups. Cows were abomasally supplemented with coconut oil (CTRL, 76 g/d), linseed and safflower oil (EFA, 78 g/d of linseed oil and 4 g/d of safflower oil; ratio of oils = 19.5:1; n-6:n-3 FA ratio = 1:3), Lutalin (CLA, 38 g/d; isomers cis-9,trans-11 and trans-10,cis-12; each 10 g/d), or both (EFA+CLA). Blood samples were taken to measure changes in FA in blood plasma on d -63, -42, 1, 28, and 56, and in plasma lipid fractions (cholesterol esters, free fatty acids, phospholipids, and triglycerides) on d -42, 1, and 56 relative to calving, and in erythrocyte membrane (EM) on d 56 after calving. Traits related to the acute phase response and inflammation were measured in blood throughout the study. Liver samples were obtained for biopsy on d -63, -21, 1, 28, and 63 relative to calving to measure the mRNA abundance of genes related to the inflammatory response. The concentrations of α-linolenic acid and n-3 FA metabolites increased in lipid fractions (especially phospholipids) and EM due to EFA supplementation with higher α-linolenic acid but lower n-3 metabolite concentrations in EFA+CLA than in EFA treatment only. Concentration of linoleic acid decreased in plasma fat toward calving and increased during early lactation in all groups. Concentration of plasma arachidonic acid was lower in EFA- than in non-EFA-treated groups in lipid fractions and EM. The cis-9,trans-11 CLA increased in all lipid fractions and EM after both CLA treatments. Plasma haptoglobin was lowered by EFA treatment before calving. Plasma bilirubin was lower in EFA and CLA than in CTRL at calving. Plasma concentration of IL-1β was higher in EFA than in CTRL and EFA+CLA at certain time points before and after calving. Plasma fibrinogen dropped faster in CLA than in EFA and EFA+CLA on d 14 postpartum. Plasma paraoxonase tended to be elevated by EFA treatment, and was higher in EFA+CLA than in CTRL on d 49. Hepatic mRNA abundance revealed time changes but no treatment effects with respect to the inflammatory response. Our data confirmed the enrichment of n-3 FA in EM by EFA treatment and the inhibition of n-3 FA desaturation by CLA treatment. The elevated n-3 FA status and reduced n-6:n-3 ratio by EFA treatment indicated a more distinct effect on the inflammatory response during the transition period than the single CLA treatment, and the combined EFA+CLA treatment caused minor additional changes on the anti-inflammatory response.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to test the effects of essential fatty acids (EFA), particularly α-linolenic acid (ALA), and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) supplementation on metabolic and endocrine traits related to energy metabolism, including the somatotropic axis, in mid-lactation dairy cows. Four cows (126 ± 4 d in milk) were used in a dose-escalation study design and were abomasally infused with coconut oil (CTRL; 38.3 g/d; providing saturated fatty acids), linseed and safflower oils (EFA; 39.1 and 1.6 g/d; n-6:n-3 FA ratio = 1:3), Lutalin (CLA; cis-9,trans-11 and trans-10,cis-12 CLA, 4.6 g/d of each), or EFA and CLA (EFA+CLA) for 6 wk. The initial dosage was doubled twice after 2 wk, resulting in 3 dosages (dosages 1, 2, and 3). Each cow received each fat treatment at different times. Cows were fed with a corn silage-based total mixed ration providing a low-fat content and a high n-6:n-3 fatty acid ratio. Plasma concentrations of metabolites and hormones (insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins only on wk 0 and 6) were analyzed at wk 0, 2, 4, and 6 of each treatment period. Liver biopsies were taken before starting the trial and at wk 6 of each treatment period to measure hepatic mRNA abundance of genes linked to glucose, cholesterol and lipid metabolism, and the somatotropic axis. The changes in the milk and blood fatty acid patterns and lactation performance of these cows have already been published in a companion paper. The plasma concentration of total cholesterol increased with dosage in all groups, except CLA, reaching the highest levels in EFA+CLA and CTRL compared with CLA. The high-density lipoprotein cholesterol plasma concentration increased in CTRL and was higher than that in EFA and CLA, whereas the concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased in a dose-dependent manner in EFA and EFA+CLA, and was higher than that in CLA. Hepatic mRNA expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA synthase 1 was upregulated in all groups but was highest in EFA+CLA. Expression of sterol regulatory element-binding factor 1 tended to be lowest due to EFA treatment, whereas expression of long chain acyl-CoA-synthetase was lower in EFA than in CTRL. Hepatic mRNA expression of GHR1A tended to be higher in EFA+CLA than in CTRL. The plasma concentration of insulin-like growth factor I increased in CLA, and the plasma IGFBP-2 concentration was lower in EFA+CLA than in CTRL at wk 6. The plasma concentration of adiponectin decreased in EFA+CLA up to dosage 2. Plasma concentrations of albumin and urea were lower in CLA than in CTRL throughout the experimental period. Supplementation with EFA and CLA affected cholesterol and lipid metabolism and their regulation differently, indicating distinct stimulation after the combined EFA and CLA treatment. The decreased IGFBP-2 plasma concentration and upregulated hepatic mRNA abundance of GHR1A in EFA+CLA-supplemented cows indicated the beneficial effect of the combined EFA and CLA treatment on the somatotropic axis in mid-lactation dairy cows. Moreover, supplementation with CLA might affect protein metabolism in dairy cows.",

      "abstract": "(1) Background: Little is known on impacts of ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) treatment on lipid metabolism in children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM). (2) Methods: We analyzed glycerophospholipid fatty acids (FA) and polar lipids in plasma of 41 Pakistani children with SAM before and after 3 months of RUTF treatment using gas chromatography and flow-injection analysis tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed using univariate, multivariate tests and evaluated for the impact of age, sex, breastfeeding status, hemoglobin, and anthropometry. (3) Results: Essential fatty acid (EFA) depletion at baseline was corrected by RUTF treatment which increased EFA. In addition, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) and the ratio of arachidonic acid (AA)/linoleic acid increased reflecting greater EFA conversion to LC-PUFA, whereas Mead acid/AA decreased. Among phospholipids, lysophosphatidylcholines (lyso.PC) were most impacted by treatment; in particular, saturated lyso.PC decreased. Higher child age and breastfeeding were associated with great decrease in total saturated FA (ΣSFA) and lesser decrease in monounsaturated FA and total phosphatidylcholines (ΣPC). Conclusions: RUTF treatment improves EFA deficiency in SAM, appears to enhance EFA conversion to biologically active LC-PUFA, and reduces lipolysis reflected in decreased ΣSFA and saturated lyso.PC. Child age and breastfeeding modify treatment-induced changes in ΣSFA and ΣPC.",

      "abstract": "Rations including high amounts of corn silage are currently very common in dairy production. Diets with corn silage as forage source result in a low supply of essential fatty acids, such as α-linolenic acid, and may lead to low conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) production. The present study investigated the effects of abomasal infusion of essential fatty acids, especially α-linolenic acid, and CLA in dairy cows fed a corn silage-based diet on performance, milk composition, including fatty acid (FA) pattern, and lipid metabolism from late to early lactation. Rumen-cannulated Holstein cows (n = 40) were studied from wk 9 antepartum to wk 9 postpartum and dried off 6 wk before calving. The cows were assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups. Cows were abomasally supplemented with coconut oil (CTRL, 76 g/d), linseed and safflower oil (EFA, 78 and 4 g/d; linseed/safflower oil ratio = 19.5:1; n-6/n-3 FA ratio = 1:3), Lutalin (CLA, 38 g/d; BASF SE, Ludwigshafen, Germany; isomers cis-9,trans-11 and trans-10,cis-12 each 10 g/d) or EFA+CLA. Milk composition was analyzed weekly, and blood samples were taken several times before and after parturition to determine plasma concentrations of metabolites related to lipid metabolism. Liver samples were obtained by biopsy on d 63 and 21 antepartum and on d 1, 28, and 63 postpartum to measure triglyceride concentration. Body composition was determined after slaughter. Supplementation of CLA reduced milk fat concentration, increased body fat mass, and improved energy balance (EB) in late and early lactation, but EB was lowest during late lactation in the EFA group. Cows with CLA treatment alone showed an elevated milk citrate concentration in early lactation, whereas EFA+CLA did not reveal higher milk citrate but did have increased acetone. Milk protein was increased in late lactation but was decreased in wk 1 postpartum in CLA and EFA+CLA. Milk urea was reduced by CLA treatment during the whole period. After calving, the increase of nonesterified fatty acids in plasma was less in CLA groups; liver triglycerides were raised lowest at d 28 in CLA groups. Our data confirm an improved metabolic status with CLA but not with exclusive EFA supplementation during early lactation. Increased milk citrate concentration in CLA cows points to reduced de novo FA synthesis in the mammary gland, but milk citrate was less affected in EFA+CLA cows, indicating that EFA supplementation may influence changes in mammary gland FA metabolism achieved by CLA.",

In terms of survival, larvae from treatment b (74.5%) and c (66%) excelled over the control (a) treatment (59%). Furthermore, larvae from both the Chlorella (b) and the Selco (c) treatments showed more resilience to stress conditions (10% and 37% reduction in mortality) when exposed to high salinity conditions (18ppt) for 3 h (stress response). Overall, larvae from treatments b and c performed better than those receiving a non-enriched diet (a), likely due to the higher levels of Essential Fatty Acids (EFA) and the ability of pikeperch to desaturate and elongate fatty acids (FA) with 18 carbons to LC PUFAs (Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids). The present study provides valuable input for designing improved feeding protocols, which will increase the efficiency of pikeperch larval culture."

Four cows (126 ± 4 d in milk) were investigated in a 4 × 4 Latin square and were abomasally infused with 1 of the following for 6 wk: (1) coconut oil (control treatment, CTRL; 38.3 g/d; providing saturated FA), (2) linseed and safflower oil (EFA treatment; 39.1 and 1.6 g/d, respectively; providing mainly α-linolenic acid), (3) Lutalin (BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany; CLA treatment; cis-9,trans-11 and trans-10,cis-12 CLA, 4.6 g/d each), (4) or EFA+CLA. The initial dosage was doubled every 2 wk, resulting in 3 dosages (dosage 1, 2, and 3). Cows were fed a corn silage-based total mixed ration with a high n-6/n-3 FA ratio. Dry matter intake and milk yield were recorded daily, and milk composition was measured weekly. The FA compositions of milk fat and blood plasma were analyzed at wk 0, 2, 4, and 6. The plasma concentration and hepatic mRNA abundance of parameters linked to the antioxidative and inflammatory response were analyzed at wk 0 and 6 of each treatment period. Infused FA increased in blood plasma and milk of the respective treatment groups in a dose-dependent manner. The n-6/n-3 FA ratio in milk fat was higher in CTRL and CLA than in EFA and EFA+CLA. The sum of FA <C16 in milk fat decreased in CLA and EFA+CLA in a dosage-dependent manner. Energy-corrected milk and milk fat decreased in CLA and EFA+CLA in a dosage-dependent manner and were higher in EFA and CTRL than in CLA at dosages 2 and 3. Energy balance tended to be highest in CLA cows. Milk protein content was lower in CLA and EFA+CLA than in CTRL. Milk urea concentration decreased in CLA and EFA+CLA in a dosage-dependent manner and was lower in CLA and EFA+CLA than in EFA and CTRL at dosages 2 and 3. Milk citrate concentration increased in CLA in a dosage-dependent manner and was higher in CLA and EFA+CLA than in EFA and CTRL. Glutathione peroxidase activity in blood plasma was lower in CTRL than in EFA, and plasma concentration of β-carotene increased in EFA and EFA+CLA with dosage. Increased milk citrate pointed at reduced de novo FA synthesis and a better antioxidative status in milk due to CLA treatment. Supplementation with CLA may also affect milk protein synthesis, but EFA and CLA treatment did not influence the inflammatory status in a consistent manner in mid-lactating cows.",

      "abstract": "Objective: The development of these updated clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) was commissioned by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), The Obesity Society, American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, Obesity Medicine Association, and American Society of Anesthesiologists Boards of Directors in adherence with the AACE 2017 protocol for standardized production of CPGs, algorithms, and checklists. Methods: Each recommendation was evaluated and updated based on new evidence from 2013 to the present and subjective factors provided by experts. Results: New or updated topics in this CPG include: contextualization in an adiposity-based chronic disease complications-centric model, nuance-based and algorithm/checklist-assisted clinical decision-making about procedure selection, novel bariatric procedures, enhanced recovery after bariatric surgery protocols, and logistical concerns (including cost factors) in the current health-care arena. There are 85 numbered recommendations that have updated supporting evidence, of which 61 are revised and 12 are new. Noting that there can be multiple recommendation statements within a single numbered recommendation, there are 31 (13%) Grade A, 42 (17%) Grade B, 72 (29%) Grade C, and 101 (41%) Grade D recommendations. There are 858 citations, of which 81 (9.4%) are evidence level (EL) 1 (highest), 562 (65.5%) are EL 2, 72 (8.4%) are EL 3, and 143 (16.7%) are EL 4 (lowest). Conclusion: Bariatric procedures remain a safe and effective intervention for higher-risk patients with obesity. Clinical decision-making should be evidence based within the context of a chronic disease.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The use of medicinal plants and their derivatives is increasing, and approximately one-third of all traditional herbal medicines are intended for wound treatment. Natural products used in these treatments include vegetable oils, which are rich in essential fatty acids. Once in contact with an ulcerative surface, the oil reaches the blood and lymphatic vessels, thus eliciting systemic effects. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the local and possible systemic effects of essential fatty acids (sunflower oil) applied topically to rat wounds. METHODS: Cutaneous punch wounds (6 mm) were produced on the dorsa of 30 rats. Saline (SS), mineral oil (MO) or essential fatty acid (EFA) solutions were applied topically. Healing was evaluated after 2, 4 and 10 days (n = 5 per group) by visual and histological/morphometric examination, second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy, and cytokine and growth factor quantification in the scar tissue (real-time PCR) and in serum (ELISA). RESULTS: MO/EFA-treated animals had higher IGF-1, leptin, IL-6 and IFN-γ mRNA expression and lower serum IL-6 levels than the control (SS/MO) animals. SHG analysis showed no difference in collagen density between the animals treated with MO and EFA. CONCLUSION: EFA treatment induces topical (observed by local IGF-1, leptin, IL-6 and IFN-γ production) and systemic effects, lowering IL-6 levels in the serum. As the oil is widely used to shorten ulcer healing time, studies are needed to evaluate the treatment safety and possible undesired effects.",

As a consequence, millions of people worldwide suffer from chronic wounds. The search for new treatment alternatives is therefore an important issue. In the context of wound healing, Maggot Debridement Therapy (MDT) is an inexpensive treatment with few contraindications and very promising results. This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro feasibility and implications of larvae (= MDT) use when combined with topical agents as a strategy to identify additive or synergistic combinations. The weight and survival rate of Cochliomyia macellaria (Fabricius) (Insecta, Diptera, Calliphoridae) larvae reared in an in vitro wound with either honey, hydrogel, 10% papain gel, essential fatty acids (EFA), collagenase, or silver sulfadiazine were evaluated after 24, 48 and 72 h. Hydrogel (for weight: 24 and 72 h; for survival: 24 h) and 10% papain gel (for weight: 48 h; for survival: 48 and 72 h) demonstrated the least interference in larval weight gain and survival rate, when compared to the control group. The results obtained in this study showed that the combined use of larvae and hydrogel or 10% papain gel may be promising to maximize the tissue repair. Honey, EFA and collagenase could be used to prepare the bed of the dry wounds to receive the MDT.",

It seems that two complexes of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, mTORC1 and mTORC2, are congruent with the two bases of the Traditional Iranian Medicine (TIM) therapy, Cold and Hot nature, which are essential for the efficacy of functional oils for controlling immune responses in autoimmune diseases. Methods: We searched PubMed database, Web of Science (WOS), Google Scholar, Scopus and selected studies by predefined eligibility criteria. We then assessed their quality and extracted data. Results: The oils controlled by Cold or Hot nature may be helpful in maintaining homeostasis and preventing autoimmune diseases. In summary, studies of randomized controlled trials for allergy and cancer patients found no improvement in the signs or response to tests, despite a remarkable change in EFA fractions in the blood by supplementation with sources of borage, evening primrose, hemp seed and fish oils. In contrast, portulaca oleracea oil exhibited protective effects by anti-inflammatory properties via the PI3K/Akt/mTORC2 pathway with a deviation immune response to Th1 to treat atopic diseases and cancer. Conclusions: According to the concept of Traditional Iranian Medicine therapy, in contrast to Cold-nature oils, EFA supplementation with the sources of Hot-nature oilsis not suitable for the treatment of atopic and cancerous diseases.",

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: A zinc methionine, essential fatty acids (EFA) and biotin product (Zn supplement) was compared to an EFA and biotin product (control) in canine atopic dermatitis (CAD). ANIMALS: Twenty seven client-owned dogs with chronic CAD receiving ciclosporin or glucocorticoids. METHODS: A 24 week, randomized, double-blinded, controlled study with crossover at week 12 and 4 week period of allergy medication reduction at weeks 8 and 20. Evaluations included Canine Atopic Dermatitis Lesion Index (CADLI), pruritus Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and cytology sampling. RESULTS: In dogs receiving the zinc supplement and ciclosporin for eight weeks, 44% (n = 7) had significantly decreased CADLI from 11.9 to 6.0 (P = 0.0002) with no significant change in pruritus VAS (P = 1.0). In dogs receiving the zinc supplement and glucocorticoids for eight weeks, 55% (n = 6) had significantly decreased CADLI from 10.9 to 5.0 (P = 0.0043) and pruritus VAS from 7.4 to 3.2 (P = 0.0166). For dogs receiving either steroids or ciclosporin there was a reduction in use of such medications, for at least four weeks, in 63% of dogs receiving the zinc supplement and 37% of dogs receiving the control. This difference was not significant (P = 0.1027). Seventy eight percent of dogs were diagnosed and treated for superficial skin infections during the study. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This study supports a potential benefit of adjunctive zinc methionine supplementation in CAD. Dogs receiving glucocorticoids may be more likely to benefit. Further studies are needed to substantiate these initial results.",

The objective of this study was to determine the association between whole-blood EFA and cognitive function in Tanzanian children. A total of 325 2-6-year-old children attempted the dimensional change card sort (DCCS) tasks to assess executive function. Blood samples were collected for fatty acid (FA) analysis by GC. Associations between executive function and FA levels were assessed by regression. Among the 130 4-6-year-old children who attempted the DCCS tasks, whole-blood levels of linoleic acid were positively associated with executive function, whereas whole-blood levels of α-linolenic acid and nervonic acid were inversely associated with executive function. A full model including all twenty-five FA explained 38 % of the variation in executive function, whereas a reduced model including only the EFA (α-linolenic acid and linoleic acid), DHA and EPA explained 25 % of the variation in executive function. Children who had sufficient whole-blood levels of EFA were 3·8 times more likely to successfully complete all DCCS tasks compared with children with insufficient EFA. These results suggest that whole-blood FA levels are associated with cognitive abilities. Intervention trials that include assessment of whole-blood FA levels are required to determine the relationships between intake, blood levels and executive function in Tanzanian children.",

We therefore tested the effects of vitamin, mineral and n-3 supplementation on behaviour in a 12-week double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial in typically developing UK adolescents aged 13-16 years (n 196). Changes in erythrocyte n-3 and 6 fatty acids and some mineral and vitamin levels were measured and compared with behavioural changes, using Conners' teacher ratings and school disciplinary records. At baseline, the children's PUFA (n-3 and n-6), vitamin and mineral levels were low, but they improved significantly in the group treated with n-3, vitamins and minerals (P=0·0005). On the Conners disruptive behaviour scale, the group given the active supplements improved, whereas the placebo group worsened (F=5·555, d=0·35; P=0·02). The general level of disciplinary infringements was low, thus making it difficult to obtain improvements. However, throughout the school term school disciplinary infringements increased significantly (by 25 %; Bayes factor=115) in both the treated and untreated groups. However, when the subjects were split into high and low baseline infringements, the low subset increased their offences, whereas the high-misbehaviour subset appeared to improve after treatment. But it was not possible to determine whether this was merely a statistical artifact. Thus, when assessed using the validated and standardised Conners teacher tests (but less clearly when using school discipline records in a school where misbehaviour was infrequent), supplementary nutrition might have a protective effect against worsening behaviour.",

      "abstract": "Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a common chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease. Early and accurate detection is essential for effective disease treatment. Recently, research has focused on genomics and proteomics. However, the associated metabolic variations, especially fatty acid profiles, have been poorly discussed. In this study, the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) approach and multivariate statistical analysis were used to investigate the metabolic profiles of serum free fatty acids (FFAs) and esterified fatty acids (EFAs) in AS patients. The results showed that significant differences in most of the FFA (C12:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:3, C20:4, C20:5, C22:5 and C22:6) and EFA (C12:0, C16:1, C18:0, C18:1, C18:2, C18:3, C20:4 and C22:6) concentrations were found between the AS patients and healthy controls (p < 0.05). Principal component analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis were performed to classify the AS patients and controls. Additionally, FFAs C20:4, C12:0, C18:3 and EFAs C22:6, C12:0 were confirmed as potential biomarkers to identify AS patients and healthy controls. The present study highlights that differences in the serum FFA and EFA profiles of AS patients reflect the metabolic disorder. Moreover, FFA and EFA biomarkers appear to have clinical applications for the screening and diagnosis of AS.",

      "abstract": "Essential fatty acid (EFA) is known to be required for the body to function normally and healthily. However, the effect of EFA on glucose uptake in skeletal muscle has not yet been fully investigated. In this study, we examined the effect of two EFAs, linoleic acid (LA) and α-linolenic acid (ALA), on glucose uptake of C2C12 skeletal muscle cells and investigated the mechanism underlying the stimulatory effect of polyunsaturated EFAs in comparison with monounsaturated oleic acid (OA). In palmitic acid (PA)-induced insulin resistant cells, the co-treatment of EFAs and OA with PA almost restored the PA-induced decrease in the basal and insulin-stimulated 2-NBDG (fluorescent D-glucose analogue) uptake, respectively. Two EFAs and OA significantly protected PA-induced suppression of insulin signaling, respectively, which was confirmed by the increased levels of Akt phosphorylation and serine/threonine kinases (PKCθ and JNK) dephosphorylation in the western blot analysis. In PA-untreated, control cells, the treatment of 500 µM EFA significantly stimulated 2-NBDG uptake, whereas OA did not. Phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and one of its downstream molecules, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) was markedly induced by EFA, but not OA. In addition, EFA-stimulated 2-NBDG uptake was significantly inhibited by the pre-treatment of a specific AMPK inhibitor, adenine 9-β-D-arabinofuranoside (araA). These data suggest that the restoration of suppressed insulin signaling at PA-induced insulin resistant condition and AMPK activation are involved at least in the stimulatory effect of EFA on glucose uptake in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells."

      "abstract": "Certain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) called essential fatty acids (EFAs) cannot be biosynthesized by the body and hence, need to be obtained from diet. These PUFAs and their metabolites have multiple physiological functions that are altered in tumor cells due to a decreased expression of Δdelta-6-desaturase, which is an essential step in their metabolism. As a result, tumor cells would be protected from the toxic effect caused by free radicals, one product of EFA metabolism. EFAs have been proposed to have therapeutic potential in the treatment of glioblastoma. Gliomas are the most common primary tumors of the central nervous system in children and adults. High-grade gliomas remain a therapeutic challenge in neuro-oncology because there is no treatment that achieves a significant improvement in survival. Novel therapeutic strategies that use PUFAs for the treatment of gliomas have been assessed in cell cultures, rodent glioma models, and humans, with encouraging results. Here we review the latest progress made in the field.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the treatment of phrynoderma, various nutrients have been tried in different dosages and routes with variable therapeutic outcomes. AIMS: The present study was undertaken to compare the efficacy of various nutrients in the treatment of phrynoderma. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: An open label randomized controlled study was conducted in the out-patient department of Dermatology in a tertiary care hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The patients were divided into group of five and each patient received one of the five regimens [10 injections of Vitamin A 1 lakh units, intramuscularly (IM) on alternate day, 10 injections of Vitamin B complex, 2cc IM on alternate day, 2 table spoon of safflower oil, two times daily with meals, Tab Vitamin E 400mg once daily, and only topical keratolytic (salicylic acid 3% ointment) two times daily] respectively. The first four regimens also received topical keratolytic. The primary outcome measured was therapeutic response at the end of regimen. The response was graded based on the percentage of flattening and decrease in number of lesions. Less than 25% improvement was graded as poor, 26-50% improvement as moderate, 51-75% improvement as good, and more than 75% improvement as excellent response. In the statistical analysis, comparison was done using Chi-square and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: A total of 125 patients were included in the study with 25 patients each in five regimen groups. There were 79 (63.2%) males and 46 (36.8%) females with a ratio of 1.72:1. The age of the patients ranged from 3 to 26 years with mean of 10.1±4.3 years. Out of 125 patients, 105 completed the study. In regimen 1 and 2, significant number of patients showed good to excellent response whereas significant number of patients in remaining regimen showed moderate to poor response with a p value of <0.05. The therapeutic response to Vitamin A and Vitamin B complex therapy was significantly better than other regimens. CONCLUSION: Intramuscular injections of Vitamin A or Vitamin B are effective in the treatment of phrynoderma. Addition of topical keratolytics helps in faster clearance of keratotic lesions."

A nutritional approach based on low-fat/high-protein content diet associated or not with medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) showed to be an efficient conservative treatment to improve the milky urine appearance in a patient with chyluria. CASE REPORT: A 30-year-old female patient was admitted with chyluria of unknown etiology. An ureteropyeloscopy revealed a single lesion in each kidney, both with linear aspect and measuring 5 mm in extension. These lesions were located close to the renal papillae and were leaking a cloudy and milky fluid. Both lesions were laser cauterized followed by improvement of the milky urine. However, the chyluria relapsed after few months and a low-fat/high-protein content diet with 10 g of soybean oil to meet the requirements essential fatty acids (EFA) and with MCT from coconut oil as alternative to prepare foods was started. Few weeks later the patient returned reporting consistent improvement of the milky urine appearance related with the use of the diet. However since the diet was tasteless and time consuming to prepare, she reported low compliance to diet with MCT and the milky urine relapsed. The MCT was discontinued and the diet with EFA source was maintained with better compliance. Since then the chyluria remains in remission. In conclusion, the dramatic improvement of the milky urine with low-fat/high-protein diet with EFA source observed in our patient demonstrates that this nutritional approach is efficient with fast results to treat chyluria during long term.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress (OS) has been implicated in the etiology of certain neurodegenerative disorders. Some of these disorders have been associated with unbalanced levels of essential fatty acids (EFA). The response of certain brain regions to OS, however, is not uniform and a selective vulnerability or resilience can occur. In our previous study on rat brains, we observed that a two-generation EFA dietary restriction reduced the number and size of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) rostro-dorso-medial. To understand whether OS contributes to this effect, we assessed the status of lipid peroxidation (LP) and anti-oxidant markers in both SN and corpus striatum (CS) of rats submitted to this dietary treatment for one (F1) or two (F2) generations. Wistar rats were raised from conception on control or experimental diets containing adequate or reduced levels of linoleic and α-linolenic fatty acids, respectively. LP was measured using the thiobarbituric acid reaction method (TBARS) and the total superoxide dismutase (t-SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzymatic activities were assessed. The experimental diet significantly reduced the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels of SN phospholipids in the F1 (~28%) and F2 (~50%) groups. In F1 adult animals of the experimental group there was no LP in both SN and CS. Consistently, there was a significant increase in the t-SOD activity (p < 0.01) in both regions. In EF2 young animals, degeneration in dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neurons and a significant increase in LP (p < 0.01) and decrease in the CAT activity (p < 0.001) were detected in the SN, while no inter-group difference was found for these parameters in the CS. Conversely, a significant increase in t-SOD activity (p < 0.05) was detected in the CS of the experimental group compared to the control. The results show that unbalanced EFA dietary levels reduce the redox balance in the SN and reveal mechanisms of resilience in the CS under this stressful condition."

      "abstract": "The soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) enzyme regulates the levels of endogenous epoxygenated fatty acid (EFA) lipid metabolites by rapidly degrading these molecules. The EFAs have pleiotropic biological activities including the modulation of nociceptive signaling. Recent findings indicate that the EFAs, in particular the arachidonic acid (AA) derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) derived epoxydocosapentaenoic acids (EpDPEs) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) derived epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (EpETEs) are natural signaling molecules. The tight regulation of these metabolites speaks to their importance in regulating biological functions. In the past several years work on EFAs in regard to their activities in the nervous system evolved to demonstrate that these molecules are anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive. Here we focus on the recent advances in understanding the effects of sEH inhibition and increased EFAs on the nociceptive system and their ability to reduce pain. Evidence of their role in modulating pain signaling is given by their direct application and by inhibiting their degradation in various models of pain. Moreover, there is mounting evidence of EFAs role in the crosstalk between major nociceptive and anti-nociceptive systems which is reviewed herein. Overall the fundamental knowledge generated within the past decade indicates that orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitors of sEH may find a place in the treatment of a number of diverse painful conditions including inflammatory and neuropathic pain.",

      "abstract": "Linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid are essential fatty acids (eFAs) and have to be acquired from the diet. eFAs are the precursors for long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (lcPUFAs), which are important immune-modulating compounds. lcPUFAs can be converted into eicosanoids and other mediators. They affect membrane structure and fluidity and can alter gene expression. There has been a marked change in dietary fatty acid intake over the last several decades. Since eFAs are acquired from the diet and immune development occurs mainly perinatally, the maternal diet may influence fetal and neonatal eFA levels, and thereby lcPUFA status, and thus immune development and function. To study whether early exposure to eFAs can program immune function, mice were fed diets varying in the ratio of ω-3 to ω-6-eFAs during pregnancy and/or lactation. After weaning, pups received a Western-style diet. At 11 weeks of age, the effects of maternal diet on the offspring's allergic and vaccination responses were examined using the T-helper 2 driven ovalbumin-induced allergy model and the T-helper 1 driven influenza-vaccination model, respectively. Offspring of dams fed a high α-linolenic acid diet during lactation showed an enhanced vaccination response. As diets with either low or high ω-3/ω-6-eFA ratio attenuated the T-helper 2 allergic response, the high α-linolenic acid diet fed during lactation had the most pronounced effect. These results indicate that there is a programming effect of maternal diet on the offspring's immune response and that in mice the window of greatest susceptibility to maternal dietary intervention is the lactation/suckling period."

Reserpine-induced orofacial dyskinesia and catalepsy (P < 0.05) were prevented by FO (P < 0.05). Biochemical evaluations showed that reserpine treatment increased the lipid peroxidation in the cortex and striatum (P < 0.05), while the FO supplementation prevented this oxidative effect in both brain regions (P < 0.05).

While there is evidence that phospholipid metabolism is at least impaired in individuals with AD, it has not been established whether phospholipid metabolism is implicated in causal, mechanistic or epiphenomenological models. More research is needed to ascertain whether breastfeeding, and specifically, the administration of colostrum or an adequate substitute can play a preventative role by supplying the neonate with essential fatty acids (EFAs) at a critical juncture in their development.

      "abstract": "Familial hypocholesterolemia, namely abetalipoproteinemia, hypobetalipoproteinemia and chylomicron retention disease (CRD), are rare genetic diseases that cause malnutrition, failure to thrive, growth failure and vitamin E deficiency, as well as other complications. Recently, the gene implicated in CRD was identified. The diagnosis is often delayed because symptoms are nonspecific. Treatment and follow-up remain poorly defined.The aim of this paper is to provide guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of children with CRD based on a literature overview and two pediatric centers 'experience.The diagnosis is based on a history of chronic diarrhea with fat malabsorption and abnormal lipid profile. Upper endoscopy and histology reveal fat-laden enterocytes whereas vitamin E deficiency is invariably present. Creatine kinase (CK) is usually elevated and hepatic steatosis is common. Genotyping identifies the Sar1b gene mutation.Treatment should be aimed at preventing potential complications. Vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal distension improve on a low-long chain fat diet. Failure to thrive is one of the most common initial clinical findings. Neurological and ophthalmologic complications in CRD are less severe than in other types of familial hypocholesterolemia. However, the vitamin E deficiency status plays a pivotal role in preventing neurological complications. Essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency is especially severe early in life. Recently, increased CK levels and cardiomyopathy have been described in addition to muscular manifestations. Poor mineralization and delayed bone maturation do occur. A moderate degree of macrovesicular steatosis is common, but no cases of steatohepatitis cirrhosis. Besides a low-long chain fat diet made up uniquely of polyunsaturated fatty acids, treatment includes fat-soluble vitamin supplements and large amounts of vitamin E. Despite fat malabsorption and the absence of postprandial chylomicrons, the oral route can prevent neurological complications even though serum levels of vitamin E remain chronically low. Dietary counseling is needed not only to monitor fat intake and improve symptoms, but also to maintain sufficient caloric and EFA intake. Despite a better understanding of the pathogenesis of CRD, the diagnosis and management of the disease remain a challenge for clinicians. The clinical guidelines proposed will helpfully lead to an earlier diagnosis and the prevention of complications.",

      "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes is a multifactorial disease involving genetic and environmental factors and results from the destruction of pancreatic islet β cells, virtually the only source of insulin. When the majority of β cells are lost, a 'honeymoon' period of variable length follows: namely, a fleeting phase of residual endogenous insulin production, during which glycemic control is achieved with modest or no doses of insulin. However, the remaining β cells are eventually lost, causing the individual to become insulin-dependent and to require long-term insulin therapy or islet transplantation. Here we show that NOD mice, a type 1 diabetes model, survived significantly longer when their diet was changed from one chow with a high essential fatty acid (EFA) ratio (n-6/n-3, 14.5) to another with a low n-6/n-3 ratio (3.0) within 6 days after the onset of overt diabetes (i.e. the 'honeymoon' period), than mice that were continuously fed with the chow with the high n-6/n-3 ratio. This effect was not observed when the chow was changed later than 9 days after the onset. Significantly larger number of islets remained with suggestive islet neogenesis from the pancreatic duct and pathological changes in renal glomeruli were significantly milder in NOD mice fed the chow with the low n-6/n-3 ratio within 6 days after the onset of overt diabetes than those continuously fed with the high-n-6/n-3-ratio chow. These findings indicate that a diet with a low n-6/n-3 ratio prolongs the 'honeymoon' period by retaining the β cell mass, suggesting its potential therapeutic merit.",

Although this selective COX-2 inhibitor, like diet, may alter the fatty acid and eicosanoid pattern, data on the potential alteration in tissues after use, are scarce. The aims were to study if rofecoxib might influence the fatty acid distribution in serum phospholipids and duodenal lesions, mRNA for COX-1 and COX-2 in leucocytes and duodenal lesions, and finally plasma levels of PGE(2) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study (n = 38). Significant reductions were found for essential fatty acid index both in serum phospholipids (P = 0.01, 95% CI = -0.9; -0.1), and in duodenal lesions (P = 0.04, 95 CI % = -0.9; -0.1) after treatment. No treatment effects were found on the COX mRNA expression, or in the plasma PGE(2) levels. Dietary AA/EPA ratio was inversely associated with all the indicators of EFA status (all P < 0.01). These findings suggest that the effects of COX chemoprevention should be further investigated in FAP and that dietary needs should be included in the treatment of FAP.",

      "abstract": "Nutritional supplementation with omega-6 essential fatty acids (omega-6 EFAs) is of potential interest in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. EFAs play a vital role in skin structure and physiology. EFA deficiency replicates the symptoms of atopic dermatitis, and patients with atopic dermatitis have been reported to have imbalances in EFA levels. Although direct proof is lacking, it has been hypothesized that patients with atopic dermatitis have impaired activity of the delta-6 desaturase enzyme, affecting metabolism of linoleic acid to gamma-linolenic acid (GLA). However, to date, studies of EFA supplementation in atopic dermatitis, most commonly using evening primrose oil, have produced conflicting results. Borage oil is of interest because it contains two to three times more GLA than evening primrose oil. This review identified 12 clinical trials of oral or topical borage oil for treatment of atopic dermatitis and one preventive trial. All studies were controlled and most were randomized and double-blind, but many were small and had other methodological limitations. The results of studies of borage oil for the treatment of atopic dermatitis were highly variable, with the effect reported to be significant in five studies, insignificant in five studies, and mixed in two studies. Borage oil given to at-risk neonates did not prevent development of atopic dermatitis. However, the majority of studies showed at least a small degree of efficacy or were not able to exclude the possibility that the oil produces a small benefit. Overall, the data suggest that nutritional supplementation with borage oil is unlikely to have a major clinical effect but may be useful in some individual patients with less severe atopic dermatitis who are seeking an alternative treatment. Which patients are likely to respond cannot yet be identified. Borage oil is well tolerated in the short term but no long-term tolerability data are available.",

      "abstract": "Essential fatty acids (EFAs) play many important roles in human biology, affecting organ systems and cellular and intracellular function. Omega-3 and omega-6 EFAs are the precursors of eicosanoids, locally acting hormones involved in mediating inflammatory processes. It is largely via the production of these eicosanoids that the essential fatty acids influence human health and disease. In general, the omega-3 derived eicosanoids are anti-inflammatory while the n-6 pathway eicosanoids promote inflammation. To date, EFAs have been primarily studied with regard to systemic diseases, particularly cardiovascular disease. Currently, no dietary recommendations of EFAs for the prevention or treatment of eye disease exist. The majority of studies concerning EFAs and eye disease have focused on diseases of the retina. This article provides an overview of the current literature regarding EFAs and dry eye disease (DED). Eight studies were identified, including six randomized controlled trials. All the studies preliminarily confirmed that there is a relationship between EFA supplementation and improvement in DED. However, strong conclusions cannot be made yet because of limitations in the research reported. The role of essential fatty acids is an important topic that would benefit from a large, multicenter, randomized clinical trial powered to reach a conclusion regarding the efficacy of essential fatty acids in the treatment of dry eye disease.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Dry eye is a common complaint often encountered in optometric practice. However, it is a difficult condition to treat as clinical signs do not always correlate with patient symptoms. Essential fatty acids (EFA), particularly omega-3 EFA, may be effective in dealing with the underlying causes. METHODS: A literature review was carried out on the PubMed, ScienceDirect and Ovid databases. Searches included keywords such as 'dry eye', 'essential fatty acids' and 'nutrition' to find articles relating to the treatment of dry eye syndrome (DES) with omega-3 EFAs. RESULTS: Omega-3 and -6 EFAs need to be consumed together within a reasonable ratio to be effective. Currently, typical diets in developed countries lack omega-3 EFA and this results in an overexposure to omega-6. Omega-3 supplementation has an anti-inflammatory effect, inhibiting creation of omega-6 prostaglandin precursors. Omega-3 EFAs also demonstrate anti-inflammatory action in the lacrimal gland preventing apoptosis of the secretory epithelial cells. Supplementation clears meibomitis, allowing a thinner, more elastic lipid layer to protect the tear film and cornea. CONCLUSION: Dietary supplementation of omega-3 EFA has already proven to be effective in coronary heart disease and arthritis. Safety is not a concern as it works synergistically with omega-6 in the body. Evidence suggests that supplementation with omega-3 EFA may be beneficial in the treatment and prevention of DES.",

      "abstract": "AIM: To evaluate the lipid-regulating effects of extract from Ginkgo biloba leaves (EGB) using pharmacological methods and metabonomic profiling in a rat model of diet-induced hyperlipidemia. METHODS: EGB was orally administered at a dose level of 40 mg/kg in both the EGB-prevention and -treatment groups. All rat samples obtained were examined for known and potential biomarkers and enzyme activity using commercial assay kits and GC/MS-based metabonomic profiling coupled with principal component analysis (PCA). RESULTS: The data obtained from the assay kits indicated that EGB reduced total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in rat plasma obtained from both the EGB-prevention and -treatment groups compared with those of the diet-induced hyperlipidemia group. EGB also increased the activities of lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase and excretion of fecal bile acid in rats from the EGB-prevention and-treatment groups. Using GC/MS-based metabonomic analysis, more than 40 endogenous metabolites were identified in rat plasma. PCA of rat plasma samples obtained using GC/MS produced a distinctive separation of the four treatment groups and sampling points within each group. Metabolic changes during hyperlipidemia formation and improvement resulting from EGB treatment were definitively monitored with PCA score plots. Furthermore, elevated levels of sorbitol, tyrosine, glutamine and glucose, and decreased levels of citric acid, galactose, palmitic acid, arachidonic acid, acetic acid, cholesterol, butyrate, creatinine, linoleate, ornithine and proline, were observed in the plasma of rats treated with EGB. CONCLUSION: EGB exerts multi-directional lipid-lowering effects on the rat metabonome, including limitation of the absorption of cholesterol, inactivation of HMGCoA and favorable regulation of profiles of essential polyunsaturated fatty acid (EFA). Further experiments are warranted to explore the mechanisms of action underlying the lipid-regulating effects of EGB against hyperlipidemia.",

In addition, several studies have reported abnormal nutritional status with regard to EFAs in ADHD, indicating that lower levels of long-chain PUFAs occur more frequently in the plasma and/or red blood cells of ADHD subjects. Few nutritional EFA supplementation studies have been reported in ADHD to date, but several of them have shown increased blood EFA levels, although their effects on ADHD-related symptoms were not or were only partly successful.

These pi-complexing sorbents were prepared by covalently immobilizing ionic liquids (ILs) onto silica and then coating these silica-supported ILs with silver salts. The silica-supported hydrophobic ILs enhanced the retention of silver salts on the solid sorbents. After the extraction of the polyunsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (PUFAMEs) 18:3 and 18:2 from biodiesel using the sorbents, a decrease in NO(x) emissions and an enhancement of the oxidation stability of biodiesel can be obtained. Solid phase extraction was investigated using a simple three-step procedure consisting of (1) sorbent pre-treatment, (2) sample extraction onto the sorbent and (3) stripping the sorbent by desorption solvent. The factors influencing extraction capacity and selectivity were also studied. 10.5 Mg of sorbent AgBF(4)/SiO(2) x Im(+) x PF(6)(-) could completely adsorb the 18:3 (0.66 mg) from standard biodiesel hexane solution in 5 min. After a consecutive two-step stripping by diethyl ether and 1-hexene, the 18:3 concentration (wt.%) was increased from around 8.5% in the original biodiesel hexane solution to approximately 90% in the 1-hexene stripping solvent.",

The rats were divided into three groups, each being treated with either saline, sugar or EFA. All the animals received a closed dressing on the wounds, changed daily. Measures were taken in four moments, and the values of wound area reduction by healing, cellular inflammatory response, collagen ordering and types I and III collagen density were assessed. RESULTS: The wound healing was equal in all the three groups, but sugar promoted an inflammatory response modulation between the 7th and 14th days. On the 20th post-operative day, there were no differences between the three treated groups concerning types I and III collagen. CONCLUSIONS: The wounds healed in the three groups. The sugar group promoted effective cellular inflammatory response modulation. There were no differences between all the treated groups regarding types I and III collagen at the end of this study.",

The EFA blood profile seems to be different in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as compared to matched controls. Previous open EFA supplementation trials were successful in demonstrating significant therapeutic effects in this population, whereas most of the randomized controlled trials failed to show any benefit over placebo. The current randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial tested the influence of short-chain EFA supplementation on ADHD children, using parent and teacher questionnaires and a computerized continuous performance test. A total of 73 unmedicated children aged 7-13 years with a diagnosis of ADHD participated in the study; 63 children completed the study. The EFA supplement contained 480 mg of linoleic acid and 120 mg of alpha-linolenic acid, and the placebo contained 1000 mg of vitamin C (daily amounts); both were given for a 7-week supplementation period. Analysis of variance for repeated measures revealed that both treatments ameliorated some of the symptoms, but no significant differences were found between the groups in any of the treatment effects.",

Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) larvae were fed, from 16 days after hatching (DAH), on Artemia enriched with different oils, inducing graded dietary concentrations of DHA: (1) soyabean oil, containing no measurable amounts of DHA (NDHA); (2) fish oil, inducing a medium DHA level (MDHA, 3 g DHA/100 g fatty acids); and (3) a mixture of Easy DHA Selco and Microfeed, resulting in high DHA content (HDHA, 8 g/100 g). At 28 DAH a metabolic trial was conducted where larvae were tube fed [1-(14) C]DHA, in order to determine its absorption, retention in the gut and body tissues, as well as its oxidation. At 23 DAH the HDHA treatment induced a significantly higher larval growth, while at 32 DAH significant differences were only found between the NDHA and HDHA treatments. The absorption of tube-fed [1-(14) C]DHA was extremely high (94-95 %) and independent of feeding regime. However, in larvae fed NDHA Artemia, a significantly higher amount of label was retained in the gut compartment and a concurrently lower retention was measured in the body. A significantly higher proportion of the absorbed DHA label was oxidized in larvae fed HDHA, compared to NDHA. Based on these results, we suggest that increasing dietary supply of DHA above the larval requirement level results in its increased oxidation for energy purposes and we propose potential applications of the tube feeding methodology using radiolabelled EFA in conjunction with dose-response studies.",

In addition to the pharmacotherapy, which is the primary treatment of ADHD, nutritional intervention may have a significant impact on ADHD symptoms. We studied lipid and lipoprotein profiles, fatty acid (FA) composition, and oxidant-antioxidant status in 37 pediatric ADHD patients and 35 healthy control subjects. Our results show that plasma triacylglycerols and phospholipids were lower, whereas free cholesterol, HDL, and apolipoprotein A-I were higher in ADHD patients compared with controls. The proportion of plasma EPA and DHA was higher, but that of oleic and alpha-linolenic (ALA) acids was lower. As expected from these findings, the proportions of both total saturates and polyunsaturates fatty acids (PUFA) were higher and lower, respectively, in ADHD patients than in controls, which led to a significant decrease in the PUFAs/saturates ratio. On the other hand, the ratios of eicosatrienoic acid to arachidonic acid and of palmitoleic acid to linoleic acid, established indexes of essential fatty acid (EFA) status remained unchanged revealing that EFA did not affect ADHD patients. Similarly, the activity of delta-6 desaturase, estimated by the ratio of 18:2(n-6)/20:4(n-6), was found unaffected, whereas ALA/EPA was diminished. Lessened lipid peroxidation was noted in ADHD subjects as documented by the diminished values of plasma malondialdehyde accompanied by increased concentrations of gamma-tocopherol. In conclusions, significant changes occur in the lipid and lipoprotein profiles, as well as in the oxidant-antioxidant status of ADHD patients, however, the FA distribution does not reflect n-3 FA deficiency.",

This study compared such a diet (Eukanuba Veterinary Diets Dermatosis FP) with a home-cooked equivalent (fish and potato) in a randomised, single-blinded, cross-over trial. Twenty dogs with perennial AD were randomly assigned to receive either the test (group A) or the control diet (group B) for 1 month, followed by the contrasting diet for a further month. Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index (CADESI version 2) and pruritus (visual analogue scale) scores were recorded at days 0, 30 and 60. Eight dogs in each group completed the study. CADESI scores significantly declined when dogs were fed the test diet (group A P < 0.01; group B P < 0.001), and increased (group A P < 0.05) or remained steady (group B) on the control diet. CADESI scores decreased in 15 of 16 dogs fed the test diet, but this was less than 50% in all cases. Pruritus scores also declined when dogs were fed the test diet compared to the control diet, but this was only significant for group A (P = 0.027). Pruritus was reduced in 11 of 16 dogs fed the test diet, but this was 50% or more in only two dogs. This trial provides evidence for the efficacy of Eukanuba Veterinary Diets Dermatosis FP in canine AD, although it is likely that most cases will require adjunct therapy. The mechanism is unclear, but may involve increased and balanced EFA levels.",

      "abstract": "Information from a preceding lipid study contributed to the pathobiological assessment of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). Lipid-driven signaling pathways are responsible for laryngeal carcinogenesis and immunodeficiency. The construction of fatty acid (FA) profiles for LSCC allowed the identification of FA role players. The integration of lipid and clinicomolecular information encountered in the literature, in turn, allowed the identification of biological prognostic markers to distinguish between early (less aggressive) and advanced (more aggressive) LSCCs. High arachidonic acid (AA) and cyclooxygenase (COX-2) activities are criteria for less aggressive growth, whilst low AA and COX-2 activities occur during more aggressive growth. Excessive tobacco use and environmental smoke or human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and alcohol abuse can, respectively, elicit cumulative oxidative stress and an oxidative burst or interfere with signaling pathways during essential fatty acid (EFA) metabolism, all factors and events which may cause LSCC. Research revealed that enhanced COX-2 activity and Bcl-2 expression prevent apoptosis and, hence, LSCCs become resistant to radiotherapy. It was also observed that recurrent laryngeal cancers become more aggressive after radiotherapy failure. It is predicted that manipulation of AA activity and consequently a cascade of downstream factors that include COX-2 and Bcl-2 expression responsible for LSCC may have therapeutic potential to improve radiotherapy outcome during early LSCC. Adjuvant FA therapy to improve early LSCC management by counteracting radiotherapy failure and unwanted complications for further management is proposed. FA therapeutic strategies before and during radiotherapeutic courses need to be evaluated.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine if the available data support the use of omega-3 essential fatty acids (EFA) for clinical use in the prevention and/or treatment of psychiatric disorders. PARTICIPANTS: The authors of this article were invited participants in the Omega-3 Fatty Acids Subcommittee, assembled by the Committee on Research on Psychiatric Treatments of the American Psychiatric Association (APA). EVIDENCE: Published literature and data presented at scientific meetings were reviewed. Specific disorders reviewed included major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, dementia, borderline personality disorder and impulsivity, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Meta-analyses were conducted in major depressive and bipolar disorders and schizophrenia, as sufficient data were available to conduct such analyses in these areas of interest. CONSENSUS PROCESS: The subcommittee prepared the manuscript, which was reviewed and approved by the following APA committees: the Committee on Research on Psychiatric Treatments, the Council on Research, and the Joint Reference Committee. CONCLUSIONS: The preponderance of epidemiologic and tissue compositional studies supports a protective effect of omega-3 EFA intake, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in mood disorders. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials demonstrate a statistically significant benefit in unipolar and bipolar depression (p = .02). The results were highly heterogeneous, indicating that it is important to examine the characteristics of each individual study to note the differences in design and execution. There is less evidence of benefit in schizophrenia. EPA and DHA appear to have negligible risks and some potential benefit in major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, but results remain inconclusive in most areas of interest in psychiatry. Treatment recommendations and directions for future research are described. Health benefits of omega-3 EFA may be especially important in patients with psychiatric disorders, due to high prevalence rates of smoking and obesity and the metabolic side effects of some psychotropic medications.",

      "abstract": "The treatment of psychiatric illness requires novel pharmacological strategies. There is a growing body of evidence examining the role of neuronal phospholipid abnormalities in the pathogenesis of psychiatric illness, particularly in schizophrenia. However, work in other conditions like mood disorders are also showing interesting outcomes with EPA supplementation. Diseases that are considered to have a genetic basis may be significantly influenced by environmental factors including dietary supplementation. The suggestion that EFA supplementation may prevent the onset of symptoms of a psychiatric disease or aberrant behaviour needs longitudinal randomized controlled research. In recent years the focus has shifted from omega-6 to omega-3. It is true that western diets have far more omega-6 than omega-3. In the 1980s, there were positive outcomes in research studies using GLA in schizophrenia (Vaddadi et al., 1989). Future research needs to incorporate studies using pure GLA. Research should not be restricted to parent fatty acid (omega-3) supplementation alone but be expanded to include bioactive down-the-chain metabolites. The recent identification of novel omega-3 derived mediators such as resolvins and neuroprotectins, which are a highly bioactive (1-10 nMol range), may well have some role to play in psychiatric disorders; however this remains highly speculative at this stage.",

      "abstract": "Essential fatty acids (EFAs), and their longer-chain more-unsaturated derivatives (LCPUFAs) in particular, are essential for normal growth and cognitive development during childhood. Children with inborn errors of amino acid metabolism represent a risk population for a reduced LCPUFA status because their diet is low in EFAs and LCPUFAs. We have investigated the EFA and LCPUFA status of children with various amino acid metabolism disorders (not PKU) under treatment. Fatty acid profiles of plasma and erythrocyte phospholipids of 33 patients (aged 0-18 years) and 38 matched controls were determined by gas-liquid chromatography. Food-frequency questionnaires were used to assess the mean fatty acid intake. The dietary intake of the EFAs linoleic acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) was comparable in both groups, while the LCPUFA intake was much lower in patients. This was associated with lower relative concentrations (% of total fatty acids) of n-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in plasma and erythrocyte phospholipids. Concentrations of arachidonic acid (AA) did not differ. The same was observed for the two EFAs LA and ALA. Thus, as compared to healthy controls, children with amino acid metabolism disorders have a lower intake of LCPUFAs and have lower concentrations of DHA but not of AA in plasma and erythrocyte phospholipids. This suggests that endogenous AA synthesis might guarantee an adequate AA status. The lower DHA status, however, warrants further investigations regarding the impact of DHA supplementation on growth and development of these children.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) status of children with PKU is often compromised. LC-PUFA, which are important fatty acids in the development of the CNS, can be synthesised endogenously from the parent essential fatty acids (EFA) provided dietary intakes are adequate. This study was designed to assess the biochemical effect over a 20-week period of a phe-free protein substitute that has been supplemented with a balanced blend of n-3 and n-6 EFAs on LC-PUFA status of children with PKU. DESIGN, SETTING AND SUBJECTS: Fifty three community-living children aged 1-10 years diagnosed with PKU in the newborn period were recruited from seven tertiary centres in the UK and France and randomised to a fat-free control formula or the EFA-supplemented test-treatment formula in an open, prospective study. Forty four children completed the study (20 controls, 24 test-treatments). Fatty acid status was assessed at entry and 20-weeks follow-up. Three day dietary diaries were recorded at 20 weeks' follow-up. The safety, efficacy and palatability of the test-treatment formula were also assessed. RESULTS: The test-treatment group had significantly higher intakes of fat and EFA than the control group. There was a significant between group difference (P=0.04) in increases in median docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) concentrations in erythrocyte phospholipids, which increased by 19% in the test-treatment group and by 0.5% in the control group over the study period. Growth and phe control were satisfactory in all subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementing the diets of children with PKU with a balanced blend of n-6 and n-3 EFA improves DHA status without compromising AA status.",

      "abstract": "Contrary to larval essential fatty acid (EFA) requirements, the effect of dietary neutral lipid supply has been little investigated in marine fish larvae. The present work investigates the effect of feeding Senegalese sole larvae on Artemia enriched with higher or lower doses of lipid emulsion. Two lipid sources - soybean oil and fish oil - were compared. From 16 days after hatching (DAH) onwards, larvae were fed one of four experimental treatments: Artemia enriched on a high or low dose of soybean oil emulsion (HS and LS) or Artemia enriched on a high or low dose of fish oil emulsion (HF and LF). In terms of growth, the dietary lipid level did not have a significant effect while the soybean oil treatments induced a lower growth than the fish oil-enriched Artemia. The fatty acid (FA) composition of the larvae closely reflected the dietary quantitative and qualitative FA profile. Only slight dietary effects were noted in the activity of trypsin, lipase and alkaline phosphatase. A higher amount of lipid droplets was noticeable in the posterior intestine epithelia and in the hepatocytes of larvae fed Artemia enriched with higher lipid doses, while LS-Artemia induced the lower lipid accumulation on the basal zone of the enterocytes, in accordance with the lowest total lipid level measured in this treatment. These results suggest an important effect of dietary total lipid level on lipid accumulation in the enterocytes and on FA absorption. At 33 DAH a tube feeding trial was conducted with 14C-labelled oleic acid (OA) or triolein (TRI), showing that the lower accumulation of lipid droplets in the larvae fed LS was associated with a significantly higher absorption and retention in the gut and body tissues of the TRI label. For OA no significant differences between treatments were found. TRI label was considerably more evacuated than OA, indicating that sole larvae may have a lower capacity to incorporate a triacylglycerol, which needs to be digested. Finally, OA appears to be preferentially utilized for energy production, accumulating more in larval tissues when absorbed in higher amounts.",

METHODS: Subjects randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to a phe-free protein substitute supplemented with EFA (test-treatment group) or a phe-free, fat-free protein substitute (control group) for 20 weeks. 3-day semi-weighed records of food intakes collected at the end of the study period. RESULTS: Total fat and alpha-linolenic acid (alpha-LA) intakes were found to be poor in the control group (n = 19). Those in the test-treatment group (n = 24) had higher fat and EFA intakes (P < 0.05), bringing intakes closer to population norms. The youngest children (<5 years of age) in the control group appeared to be especially vulnerable to poor fat intakes because of the restricted diversity of their diets and, regardless of age, alpha-LA intakes by this group were poor compared with the non-PKU population. CONCLUSIONS: The quantity and quality of fat in the diets of children with PKU, in particular young children, should be given careful consideration in trying to optimize the ratio of linoleic acid: alpha-LA in their diets and in satisfying the requirements of this group for fat and alpha-LA.",

Twenty-two non-seasonal atopic dogs of different breeds and ages were included in the 2-month trial. All the patients were given an essential fatty acid (EFA) supplementation [17 mg/kg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + 5 mg/kg docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) + 35 mg/kg gammalinolenic acid (GLA)], the global (diet + supplementation) omega-6 to omega-3 ratio was 5.5-1. Two groups of dogs were considered: group A 'pre-immunotherapy' (15 cases) included dogs with early stages atopy, which had not been submitted to any treatment yet; group B 'post-immunotherapy' (seven cases) included dogs with chronic atopy immunotherapy non-responsive. Clinical evaluations were performed at the beginning, on day 30 and at the end of the trial. Blood serum fatty acids profile was determined at the beginning and at the end of the study. Better clinical results were obtained in group A, a great difference was found between the two groups on pruritus score. Serum arachidonic acid (AA) was significantly lower at the end of the trial in group A while GLA was significantly higher in group B. We hypothesized that different-stages atopic dogs could have different response to EFA supplementation, maybe because of a different fatty acids metabolism. Early stages cases seem to be more responsive to EFA supplementation.",

      "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most commonly occurring lethal autosomal recessive disorder. The gene defect causes defective sodium and chloride transport across epithelial cells of the respiratory, hepatobiliary, gastrointestinal and reproductive tracts, resulting in thick mucus secretions. In the respiratory tract, mucus traps bacteria, causing repeated lung infections, progressive bronchiectasis and eventual death due to respiratory failure. In the gastrointestinal tract, mucus prevents pancreatic enzymes reaching the gut, leading to nutrient malabsorption. Careful nutritional management has a dramatic effect on growth and survival rates in CF. Appropriate nutritional support includes pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, a high-fat/high-energy diet and essential nutrient supplementation, specifically fat-soluble vitamins and essential fatty acids (EFA). Long-term studies are required to examine the effects of nutritional interventions on key clinical outcomes in CF, such as the rate of decline of lung function. The use of circulating markers to assess the influence of nutritional therapy allows short-term intervention studies to predict the potential for clinical improvements. This article provides an overview of the biomarkers useful in the prediction of the efficacy of nutritional therapy on improvements in quality and quantity of life in CF.",

The metabolism of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) appears to be one of the critical targets in the complex metabolic stages that lead to, or are associated with cancer. The goal of our research was to analyze the erythrocyte specific types of membrane fatty acid content, level and distribution in cancer patients as compared to non-cancer patients. Changes in fatty acid composition may affect different aspects of cell structure and function, including proliferation. Analyses of RBCs membrane fatty acids were performed for 255 patients with different types of cancer (breast, prostate, liver, pancreas, colon, and lung), 2,800 non-cancer patients and 34 healthy volunteers. Our research study demonstrated a lower level of stearic acid and an increased content of oleic acid in RBC of cancer patients in comparison with control and non-cancer patients. According to the results of this investigation, the ratio of Eicosa pentaenoic acid (EPA) and Decosa hexaenoic acid (DHA) to Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) may be useful to estimate PUFA imbalances in cancer patients. EPA and DHA acid may be recommended as supplementation and in addition to current therapy during cancer treatment.",

The new finding that ID induces an increase in the pancreas cells, leads to the hypothesis that cholecystokinin-8 (CCK-8) is involved in the ID effects. The level of CCK-8 was higher among ID rats, compared with normal rats. The ID rats in our study were anorectic and performed poorly in learning tests (Morris water maze and passive avoidance learning). Essential fatty acids (EFA) mediate dopamine activity and have been found to rehabilitate learning deficits. Treatment with a fatty acid compound blocked both the learning deficits and the anorexia, while a CCK-8 antagonist was successful only against the anorectic effects.",

      "abstract": "The term 'Mediterranean diet', implying that all Mediterranean people have the same diet, is a misnomer. The countries around the Mediterranean basin have different diets, religions and cultures. Their diets differ in the amount of total fat, olive oil, type of meat, wine, milk, cheese, fruits and vegetables; and the rates of coronary heart disease and cancer, with the lower death rates and longer life expectancy occurring in Greece. The diet of Crete represents the traditional diet of Greece prior to 1960. Analyses of the dietary pattern of the diet of Crete shows a number of protective substances, such as selenium, glutathione, a balanced ratio of n-6/n-3 essential fatty acids (EFA), high amounts of fibre, antioxidants (especially resveratrol from wine and polyphenols from olive oil), vitamins E and C, some of which have been shown to be associated with lower risk of cancer, including cancer of the breast. Epidemiological studies and animal experiments indicate that n-3 fatty acids exert protective effects against some common cancers, especially cancers of the breast, colon and prostate. Many mechanisms are involved, including suppression of neoplastic transformation, cell growth inhibition, and enhanced apoptosis and anti-angiogenicity, through the inhibition of eicosanoid production from n-6 fatty acids; and suppression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), interleukin 1 (IL-1) and IL-6 gene expression by n-3 fatty acids. Recent intervention studies in breast cancer patients indicate that n-3 fatty acids, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in particular, increase the response to chemopreventive agents. In patients with colorectal cancer, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and DHA decrease cell proliferation, and modulate favourably the balance between colonic cell proliferation and apoptosis. These findings should serve as a strong incentive for the initiation of intervention trials that will test the effect of specific dietary patterns in the prevention and management of patients with cancer.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common, progressive, neurodegenerative disease that primarily afflicts the elderly. A well-defined risk factor for late onset AD is possession of one or more alleles of the epsilon-4 variant (E4) of the apolipoprotein E gene. Meta-analysis of allele frequencies has found that E4 is rare in populations with long historical exposure to agriculture, suggesting that consumption of a high carbohydrate (HC) diet may have selected against E4 carriers. The apoE4 protein alters lipid metabolism in a manner similar to a HC diet, suggesting a common mechanism for the etiology of AD. Evolutionarily discordant HC diets are proposed to be the primary cause of AD by two general mechanisms. (1) Disturbances in lipid metabolism within the central nervous system inhibits the function of membrane proteins such as glucose transporters and the amyloid precursor protein. (2) Prolonged excessive insulin/IGF signaling accelerates cellular damage in cerebral neurons. These two factors ultimately lead to the clinical and pathological course of AD. This hypothesis also suggests several preventative and treatment strategies. A change in diet emphasizing decreasing dietary carbohydrates and increasing essential fatty acids (EFA) may effectively prevent AD. Interventions that restore lipid homeostasis may treat the disease, including drugs that increase fatty acid metabolism, EFA repletion therapy, and ketone body treatment.",

We developed murine models for EFA deficiency (EFAD) with and without extrahepatic cholestasis and compared the efficacy of oral supplementation of EFA as PL or as TG. EFAD was induced in mice by feeding a high-fat EFAD diet. After 3 wk on this diet, bile duct ligation was performed in a subgroup of mice to establish extrahepatic cholestasis. Cholestatic and noncholestatic EFAD mice continued on the EFAD diet (controls) or were supplemented for 3 wk with EFA-rich TG or EFA-rich PL. Fatty acid composition was determined in plasma, erythrocytes, liver, and brain. After 4 wk of EFAD diet, induction of EFAD was confirmed by a sixfold increased triene-to-tetraene ratio (T/T ratio) in erythrocytes of noncholestatic and cholestatic mice (P < 0.001). EFA-rich TG and EFA-rich PL were equally effective in preventing further increase of the erythrocyte T/T ratio, which was observed in cholestatic and noncholestatic nonsupplemented mice (12- and 16-fold the initial value, respectively). In cholestatic mice, EFA-rich PL was superior to EFA-rich TG in decreasing T/T ratios of liver TG and PL (each P < 0.05) and in increasing brain PL concentrations of the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid (each P < 0.05). We conclude that oral EFA supplementation in the form of PL is more effective than in the form of TG in increasing LCPUFA concentrations in liver and brain of cholestatic EFAD mice.",

The most significant observation was the complete occlusion of the tumor-feeding vessels after LGIOC injection. Follow-up angiograms performed in all the patients showed occlusion of the tumor-feeding vessels is more or less permanent. A significant reduction in the size of the tumor was also observed in these patients. LGIOC showed occlusion of tumor-feeding vessels after infusion, and further studies are needed to confirm these preliminary results.",

Human tumour cell lines (T-24 from urothelium, MCF-7 from breast and HRT-18 from colon) were used. EPA showed an anti-proliferative effect on the three lines. ETA showed the following effects: in T-24, the lipid peroxidation was decreased and E-cadherin was undetectable; in MCF-7, increased E-cadherin expression enhanced the lipid peroxidation and decreased cell proliferation; on HRT-18, the E-cadherin expression and lipid peroxidation diminished, whereas cell proliferation was increased. In conclusion, EFA (20:5 n-3) exhibited beneficial effects, whereas unusual ETA showed an opposite effect on some tumour parameters. The possible riskiness of EFA-deprivation, along with the potential of EFA as natural nutrapeutic products for human tumour prevention and treatment, makes EFA worthy of further consideration.",

Excessive levels of circulating TNF-alpha can coexist with EFAD in various clinical disorders such as cystic fibrosis and type I diabetes. The present study therefore aimed to investigate their combined effects on lipid profile and lipoprotein composition by administering TNF-alpha to EFAD rats. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL), the rate-limiting enzyme in TG catabolism, was also measured in epididymal adipose tissue. EFAD, after a 4-wk period, induced significant increases in plasma TG (80%, P < 0.001), total cholesterol (TC, 27%, P < 0.025), and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C, 62%). Two hours after the administration of TNF-alpha, a further rise in TG (43%, P < 0.05) was noted in controls, but not EFAD animals. TC and HDL-C were unaffected by TNF-alpha treatment. In addition, TNF-alpha modified lipoprotein-lipid composition. VLDL and HDL2 derived from EFAD rats were depleted in apolipoprotein (apo) E and apo A-II, and enriched in apo A-I 2 h after TNF-alpha administration. Finally, TNF-alpha decreased adipose tissue LPL activity in both control and EFAD animals. The TNF-alpha-induced inhibition was more marked in EFAD rats. The present results demonstrated that TNF-alpha can amplify or antagonize the effects of EFAD on lipid profile, lipoprotein composition, and LPL activity. These data also suggest that the host's nutritional status is a determining factor for the modulating effect of TNF-alpha on lipid metabolism.",

      "abstract": "Omega-3 (omega-3) is an essential fatty acid (EFA) found in large amounts in fish oil. It contains eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). DHA is one of the building structures of membrane phospholipids of brain and necessary for continuity of neuronal functions. Evidences support the hypothesis that schizophrenia may be the result of increased reactive oxygen species mediated neuronal injury. Recent reports also suggest the protective effect of omega-3 EFA against neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia. This study proposed to assess the changes in antioxidant enzyme and oxidant parameters in the corpus striatum (CS) of rats fed with omega-3 EFA diet (0.4g/kg/day) for 30 days. Eight control rats and nine rats fed with omega-3 were decapitated under ether anesthesia, and CS was removed immediately. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and nitric oxide (NO) levels as well as total superoxide dismutase (t-SOD) and xanthine oxidase (XO) enzyme activities in the CS were measured. Rats treated with omega-3 EFA had significantly lower values of TBARS (P<0.001), NO (P<0.002) and XO (P<0.005) whereas higher values of t-SOD enzyme activity (P<0.002) than the control rats. These results indicate that omega-3 EFA rich fish oil diet reduces some oxidant parameters in CS. This may be revealed by means of reduced CS TBARS levels as an end product of lipid peroxidation of membranes in treated rats. Additionally, reduced XO activity and NO levels may support this notion. On the other hand, although the mechanism is not clear, omega-3 EFA may indirectly enhance the activity of antioxidant enzyme t-SOD. Taken together, this preliminary animal study provides strong support for a therapeutic effect of omega-3 EFA supplemented to classical neuroleptic regimen in the treatment of schizophrenic symptoms and tardive dyskinesia.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Limited evidence supports a hypothesis suggesting that schizophrenic symptoms may be the result of altered neuronal membrane structure and metabolism. This structure and metabolism is dependent on blood plasma levels of certain essential fatty acids and their metabolites. OBJECTIVES: To review the effects polyunsaturated fatty acids for people with schizophrenia. SEARCH STRATEGY: The initial search of 1998 was updated. We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (July 2002), and authors of included studies and relevant pharmaceutical companies were contacted. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised clinical trials of polyunsaturated fatty acid treatment for schizophrenia. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Reviewers, working independently, selected, quality assessed, and extracted relevant data. Analysis was on an intention-to-treat basis. Where possible and appropriate Relative Risk (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and the number needed to treat (NNT) estimated. For continuous data, weighted mean differences (WMD) and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Data were inspected for heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS: Five short small studies (n=313) were included. One small study (n=30) suggested that an omega-3 EFA (ecisapentenoic acid (EPA) enriched oil) may have some antipsychotic properties when compared with placebo, even if not given as a supplement to standard drugs (RR not needing antipsychotic drugs 0.73 CI 0.54 to 1.00; RR less than 25% improvement in PANSS 0.54 CI 0.3 to 0.96, NNT 3 CI 2 to 29). Other studies comparing omega-3 EFA's with placebo as a supplement to antipsychotics were too small to be conclusive. There was a suggestion that people already on antipsychotics when given omega-3 EFA supplementation had greater improvement of mental state compared to those receiving a placebo supplementation but the result were not significant (n=29, 1 RCT, RR <25% improvement in PANSS 0.62 CI 0.37 to 1.05). However, the mental state of both medicated and un-medicated patients was significantly better for those receiving omega-3 EFA supplementation (n=59, 2 RCTs, RR <25% improved on PANSS 0.58 CI 0.39 to 0.85, NNT 3 CI 2-8). Medium term data, however, did not favour either group (n=87, 1 RCT, MD PANSS endpoint -1.0 CI -8.15 to 6.15). All studies had low attrition (<10% total, n=271, 4 RCTs, RR leaving the study early 0.91 CI 0.36 to 2.33). Another study (n=31) comparing two types of omega-3 EFA's, ecisapentenoic acid enriched oil and docosahexanoic acid oil, also found no differences between these two EFA's in measures of mental state. One small (n=16) study investigated the effects of an omega-6 EFA compared with placebo for tardive dyskinesia and found no clear effects. There is not a clear dose response to omega-3 supplementation. Adverse effects seem rare but diarrhoea may be a problem in the medium term. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: The use of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for schizophrenia remains experimental and large well designed, conducted and reported studies are indicated and needed.",

Evidence suggests that CLA modulates essential fatty acid (EFA) metabolism; however, it is not clear which parts of this pathway are important regulatory points modulated by CLA. Enriched mixtures of D9-cis,11-trans (D9c,11t)- and D10-trans,12-cis (D10t,12c)-18:2 were used to assess outcome measures of EFA metabolism pertaining to membrane phospholipid incorporation, tumor cell growth, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis in the MDA-MB-231 mammary tumor cell line. Tumor cells were treated with linoleic acid (LA), an equal mixture (Mix), or enriched preparations of D9c,11t- or D10t,12c-18:2. Treatment with Mix or the enriched mixture of D10t,12c-18:2 significantly inhibited the synthesis of arachidonic acid (AA) from LA, resulting in increased levels of LA and decreased levels of AA in membrane phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine (P < 0.05). LA and AA levels were not altered in cells treated with enriched D9c,11t-18:2 and were similar to those in LA control treated cells. All CLA treatments reduced [3H]thymidine uptake, an indicator of tumor cell growth, by more than one-half relative to LA controls. MDA-MB-231 cells challenged with AA in the presence of all CLA mixtures resulted in significantly reduced PGE2 synthesis relative to controls treated with LA (P < 0.05). It is evident that individual isomers exert inhibitory effects at specific steps of EFA metabolism, which correspondingly leads to a reduction in PGE2 synthesis and, ultimately, tumor growth.",

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have the potential to influence the immune system in CFS patients by supporting T helper cell 1 driven cellular immunity and may decrease allergies. In addition LAB are strong antioxidants, may improve EFA status, can enhance absorption of micronutrients by protecting the intestinal epithelial barrier, and have been used to treat SIBO.

      "abstract": "This review examines the data pertaining to an important and often underrated EFA, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). It examines its sources, metabolism, and biological effects in various population studies, in vitro, animal, and human intervention studies. The main role of ALA was assumed to be as a precursor to the longer-chain n-3 PUFA, EPA and DHA, and particularly for supplying DHA for neural tissue. This paper reveals that the major metabolic route of ALA metabolism is beta-oxidation. Furthermore, ALA accumulates in specific sites in the body of mammals (carcass, adipose, and skin), and only a small proportion of the fed ALA is converted to DHA. There is some evidence that ALA may be involved with skin and fur function. There is continuing debate regarding whether ALA has actions of its own in relation to the cardiovascular system and neural function. Cardiovascular disease and cancer are two of the major burdens of disease in the 21st century, and emerging evidence suggests that diets containing ALA are associated with reductions in total deaths and sudden cardiac death. There may be aspects of the action and, more importantly, the metabolism of ALA that need to be elucidated, and these will help us understand the biological effects of this compound better. Additionally, we must not forget that ALA is part of the whole diet and should be seen in this context, not in isolation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Early suspicion of essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD) or omega3-deficiency may rather focus on polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) or long-chain PUFA (LCP) analyses than clinical symptoms. We determined cut-off values for biochemical EFAD, omega3-and omega3/22:6omega3 [docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)]-deficiency by measurement of erythrocyte 20:3omega9 (Mead acid), 22:5omega6/20:4omega6 and 22:5omega6/22:6omega3, respectively. METHODS: Cut-off values, based on 97.5 percentiles, derived from an apparently healthy omnivorous group (six Dominica breast-fed newborns, 32 breast-fed and 27 formula+LCP-fed Dutch low-birth-weight infants, 31 Jerusalem infants, 33 Dutch 3.5-year-old infants, 69 omnivorous Dutch adults and seven Dominica mothers) and an apparently healthy group with low dietary LCP intake (81 formula-fed Dutch low-birth-weight infants, 12 Dutch vegans). Cut-off values were evaluated by their application in an EFAD suspected group of 108, mostly malnourished, Pakistani children, three pediatric patients with chronic fat-malabsorption (abetal-ipoproteinemia, congenital jejunal and biliary atresia) and one patient with a peroxisomal beta-oxidation disorder. RESULTS: Erythrocyte 20:3omega9, 22:5omega6/20:4omega6 and 22:5omega6/22:6omega3 proved age-dependent up to 0.2 years. Cut-off values for ages above 0.2 years were: 0.46mol% 20:3omega9 for EFAD, 0.068mol/mol 22:5omega6/20:4omega6 for omega3-deficiency, 0.22mol/mol 22:5omega6/22:6omega3 for omega3/DHA-marginality and 0.48mol/mol 22:5omega6/22:6omega3 for omega3/DHA-deficiency. Use of RBC 20:3omega9 and 22:5omega6/20:4omega6 cut-off values identified 20.4% of the Pakistani subjects as EFAD+omega3-deficient, 12.9% as EFAD+omega3-sufficient, 38.9% as EFA-sufficient+omega3-deficient and 27.8% as EFA-sufficient+omega3-sufficient. The patient with the peroxisomal disorder was classified as EFA-sufficient, omega3-sufficient (based on RBC 22:5omega6/20:4omega6) and omega3/DHA-deficient (based on RBC 22:5omega6/22:6omega3). The three other pediatric patients were classified as EFAD, omega3-deficient and omega3/DHA-deficient. CONCLUSION: Use of the combination of the present cut-off values for EFA, omega3 and omega3/DHA status assessment, as based on 97.5 percentiles, may serve for PUFA supplement intervention until better concepts have emerged.",

      "abstract": "The fatty acid profile of chronic renal failure (CRF) patients on maintenance haemodialysis treatment (MHT) is abnormal and results point towards an essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency. However, controversies still exist as to which of the essential fatty acids (EFAs) or EFA-products are decreased. In this study, the results of a comprehensive analysis of the fatty acids, performed on the red blood cells of 14 CRF patients on MHT, are presented. The red blood cell membrane fatty acids determined in this study include a range of saturated fatty acids (SFAs), mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Results confirmed the suggested presence of an essential fatty acid deficiency in CRF patients on MHT. It showed the total content of the n-6 fatty acids (31.66 +/- 3.21 vs 34.67 +/- 2.05), as well as the total content of the PUFAs (37.22 +/- 4.08 vs 40.93 +/- 2.35), to be significantly decreased. The total MUFA content was, in contrast, significantly increased (16.87 +/- 0.91 vs 15.49 +/- 1.18). The EFA deficiency profile seen in this study points towards that of a chronic inflammatory condition. This is borne out by the fact that all three precursors of the eicosanoids--the mediators of various inflammatory and immune responses--were reduced in the presence of an increase in MUFAs as well as SFAs. The possibility of the fatty acid profile of CRF patients on MHT being that of a chronic inflammatory condition is supported by the fact that continuous complement-dependent and complement-independent immune activation, due to bio-incompatibility between blood cells and the dialysis membranes, is known to occur during the dialysis process.",

      "abstract": "Linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids, obtained from plant material in the diet are the precursors in tissues of two families with opposing effects which are referred to as \"essential fatty acids\" (EFA): arachidonic acid (AA) and pentaene (eicosapentaenoic acid: EPA) and hexaene (docosahexaenoic acid: DHA) acids. The role of EFA is crucial, without a source of AA or compounds which can be converted into AA, synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs) by a cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme would be compromised, and this would seriously affect many normal metabolic processes. COX, also known as prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase (Pghs) or as prostaglandin G/H synthase, is a key membrane bound enzyme responsible for the oxidation of AA to PGs. Two COX isoforms have been identified, COX-1 and COX-2 that form PGH2, a common precursor for the biosynthesis of thromboxane A2 (TxA2), prostacyclin (PGI2) and PGs (PGD2, PGE2, PGF2alpha. COX-1 enzyme is expressed constitutively in most cells and tissues. Its expression remains constant under either physiological or pathological conditions controlling synthesis of those PGs primarily involved in the regulation of homeostatic functions. In contrast, COX-2 is an intermediate response gene that encodes a 71-kDa protein. COX-2 is normally absent from most cells but highly inducible in certain cells in response to inflammatory stimuli resulting in enhanced PG release. PGs formed by COX-2 primarily mediate pain and inflammation but have multiple effects that can favour tumorigenesis. They are more abundant in cancers than in normal tissues from which the cancers arise. COX-2 is a participant in the pathway of colon carcinogenesis, especially when mutation of the APC (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli) tumour suppressor gene is the initiating event. In addition, COX-2 up-regulation and elevated PGE2 levels are involved in breast carcinogenesis. It seems that there is a correlation between COX-2 level of expression and the size of the tumours and their propensity to invade underlying tissue. Inhibition by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) of COX enzymes which significantly suppress PGE2 levels, reduced breast cancer incidence and protected against colorectal cancer. Therefore it is suggested that consumption of a diet enriched in n-3 PUFA (specifically EPA and DHA) and inhibition of COX-2 by NSAIDs may confer cardioprotective effects and provide a significant mechanism for the prevention and treatment of human cancers.",

      "abstract": "The effects of a 1% addition of cholesterol to a diet low in EFA on FA desaturases were examined. The administration of cholesterol markedly increased the esterified cholesterol content in microsomes and total liver lipids from the first day, whereas the proportion of free cholesterol remained unaltered throughout the treatment. An excellent homeostasis in the free cholesterol content was apparently evoked by the acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase. The cholesterol esters were mainly oleate, palmitate, and stearate, and the addition of cholesterol increased the relative proportions of cholesterol palmitoleate and oleate. The addition of cholesterol to a low-EFA diet induced, as in animals fed a high-EFA diet, a marked increase in liver stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 mRNA and enzyme activity. This increased activity apparently evoked a similar enhancement of palmitoleic and oleic acids in total and microsomal liver lipids. The cholesterol-rich diet depressed the liver A6 and delta5 desaturase activity. However, the abundance of delta6 desaturase mRNA was not modified throughout the treatment. This indicates that the depressive effect is evoked at a step beyond that controlled by the mRNA level. The depression of both enzymatic activities was consistent with the decrease in the percentages of arachidonic acid and DHA in total and microsomal liver lipids. Taken together, these results indicate that through its modulating effect on the desaturases, dietary cholesterol may lead an animal or human fed low-EFA diet to a true deficiency by the decreased synthesis of the highly polyunsaturated acids derived from linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids.",

      "abstract": "The term \"Mediterranean diet,\" implying that all Mediterranean people have the same diet, is a misnomer. The countries around the Mediterranean basin have different diets, religions and cultures. Their diets differ in the amount of total fat, olive oil, type of meat and wine intake; milk vs. cheese; fruits and vegetables; and the rates of coronary heart disease and cancer, with the lower death rates and longer life expectancy occurring in Greece. Extensive studies on the traditional diet of Greece (the diet before 1960) indicate that the dietary pattern of Greeks consists of a high intake of fruits, vegetables (particularly wild plants), nuts and cereals mostly in the form of sourdough bread rather than pasta; more olive oil and olives; less milk but more cheese; more fish; less meat; and moderate amounts of wine, more so than other Mediterranean countries. Analyses of the dietary pattern of the diet of Crete shows a number of protective substances, such as selenium, glutathione, a balanced ratio of (n-6):(n-3) essential fatty acids (EFA), high amounts of fiber, antioxidants (especially resveratrol from wine and polyphenols from olive oil), vitamins E and C, some of which have been shown to be associated with lower risk of cancer, including cancer of the breast. These findings should serve as a strong incentive for the initiation of intervention trials that will test the effect of specific dietary patterns in the prevention and management of patients with cancer.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Investigators in Italy and Spain have suggested that therapy for patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) may result in essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency. Objectives of this study were to determine if the diets of patients with PKU in the United States provided adequate EFA intakes and whether patients could form long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. METHODS: Patients (1-13 years of age) with classic PKU undergoing therapy and their non-PKU sibling closest in age were compared. Nutrient intakes were calculated from 3-day diet diaries. Fatty acids in plasma and erythrocytes were identified and quantified. Paired t tests compared results for the patients and their non-PKU siblings. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients and 26 siblings were studied. Mean fat intake was greatest by siblings (34.8 +/- 1.3% of energy) and lowest by Phenyl-Free-fed patients (19.5 +/- 1.2% of energy; P < 0.05). Fat intake (30.4 +/- 1.8% of energy) by Phenex-fed patients did not differ from that of siblings. Percentage of energy ingested as C18:2n-6 and C18:3n-3 did not differ significantly between patients and siblings. No clinically significant, consistent differences were found in fatty acid levels (wt%) in plasma or erythrocytes between patients with PKU and siblings. CONCLUSIONS: No patient in this study exhibited a Holman index of EFA deficiency. Siblings ingested animal protein containing C20:5n-3 and C22:6n-3 fatty acids, and this may account for their greater wt% of these plasma and erythrocyte fatty acids. Because patients with PKU do not ingest fatty acids >C18 but C20:4n-6, C20:5n-3, and C22:6n-3 were found in their plasma and erythrocytes, in vivo synthesis from C18:2n-6 and C18:3n-3 appears to occur. Lack of EFA deficiency in patients in this study may be the result of the use of canola and soy oils containing C18:2n-6 and C18:3n-3 rather than olive oil in the diets.",

Because of these multi-faceted effects, EFA have been proposed for treatment of canine atopic dermatitis (AD) since 1987. To date, more than 20 trials have been performed, reporting the efficacy of either oral EFA supplements or EFA-rich diets. Unfortunately, most of these studies were found to exhibit one or more of the following deficiencies: heterogeneity of diagnoses used as inclusion criteria, short duration of supplementation, lack of randomization of treatment allocation, lack of blinding of investigators and/or owners, lack of placebo or active controls, lack of documentation of plasma or skin EFA profiles during supplementation, as well as lack of standardization of the basal diets or supplements which could have provided additional EFA. Consequently, there is presently insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of EFA to control clinical signs of canine AD. Evidence of efficacy must await the performance of blinded, randomized and controlled trials of at least 3 months duration in which diets are identical for all of study subjects. In these trials, clinical efficacy should be evaluated in relation to plasma and cutaneous EFA treatment-induced alterations.",

The goals of this study were to further explore the potential absorptive benefits of STG by comparing the intestinal absorption and lymphatic transport of tocopherol and retinol when delivered gastrically with either STG or PM under normal conditions and after I/R injury to the small bowel. Food-deprived male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to two treatments (sham controls or I/R). Under halothane anesthesia, the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) was occluded for 20 min and then reperfused in I/R rats. The SMA was isolated but not occluded in control rats. In both groups, the mesenteric lymph duct was cannulated and a gastric tube was inserted. Each treatment group received 1 mL of the fish oil/MCT STG or PM (7 rats/group) along with (14)C-alpha-tocopherol and (3)H-retinol through the gastric tube followed by an infusion of PBS at 3 mL/h for 8 h. Lymph was collected hourly for 8 h. Under steady-state conditions, the amount of (14)C-alpha-tocopherol and (3)H-retinol transported into lymph was significantly higher in the STG-fed rats compared with those fed PM in both control and I/R groups. In addition, control and I/R rats given STG had earlier steady-state outputs of (14)C-alpha-tocopherol and (3)H-retinol and maintained approximately 30% higher outputs in lymph throughout the 8-h lymph collection period compared with rats given the PM. We conclude that STG provides the opportunity to potentiate improved absorption of fat-soluble vitamins under normal and malabsorptive states.",

A neuronal membrane phospholipid hypothesis is proposed for OCD analogous to those developed for schizophrenia by Horrobin et al. and for bipolar disorder by Stoll et al. Essential fatty acid (EFA) dietary supplementation has shown some efficacy in treating schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients and should also be considered for OCD. Supporting this, a case report is presented of a subject with OCD who developed comorbid paresthesia, for whose latter condition a regimen of ibuprofen was instituted. Thirteen weeks thereafter subject's OCD symptomatology had declined by 40% (YBOC scale) from baseline. Inasmuch as ibuprofen and numerous other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) block brain neuronal prostaglandin synthase (several also inhibiting phospholipases A(2)and C), thereby reducing catabolism of neuronal membrane arachidonic acid, the ibuprofen apparently increased the integrity of subject's neuronal membranes, as would likely also be the case with EFA dietary supplementation. This OCD NSAID-EFA therapy concept should be further tested by seeking other OCD subjects, especially from arthritis and rheumatism practices (where NSAIDS are routinely employed) and medical record data banks, as OCD has an estimated worldwide population lifetime prevalence of 1% to 3% and at least a subset of OCD patients might possibly benefit.",

This study describes changes in body weight (BW) and composition, 24-h urine creatinine excretion, intestinal fatty acid absorption (total, saturated, unsaturated and EFA), and EFA status in relation to treatment with GH + GLN in 8 short bowel patients. METHODS: A double-blind, crossover study between placebo and growth hormone (mean, 0.12 mg/kg/day) plus oral (mean, 28 g/day) and parenteral glutamine (mean, 5.2 g/day) for 28 days. Body composition was measured by dual-energy absorptiometry (DEXA) scans. Intestinal fatty acid absorption was evaluated in balance studies, and EFAs were measured in plasma phospholipids by gas liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Active treatment did not increase BW, lean body mass (LBM), fat mass (FM) and bone mass significantly compared with placebo treatment, but BW increased 1.03 kg (1.7%, P < 0.05), LBM 2.93 kg (8.7%, P < 0.001) and FM decreased 2.41 kg (10.6%, P < 0.001) in comparison with baseline. Twenty-four-hour urine creatinine excretion did not differ between study periods. No changes in intestinal absorption of fatty acids were seen, and no changes in EFAs measured in plasma phospholipids were observed. Only 1 of 8 patients, who did not receive parenteral lipids, had a Holman index above 0.2, indicative of EFA deficiency. All developed peripheral oedema. CONCLUSIONS: Combined high dose growth hormone and glutamine administered for 4 weeks, did not improve absorption of fatty acids or EFA status in short bowel patients. No changes in BW or composition were seen when comparing treatment to placebo periods. The increase in LBM measured by DEXA scan, comparing treatment and baseline periods, was not accompanied by an increase in the 24-h urinary creatinine excretion and is suspected to be associated with an accumulation in extracellular fluids.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with cystic fibrosis who have steatorrhea frequently are underweight and have essential fatty acid (EFA) depletion, which is associated with a poor clinical course. It has been stated that poor EFA status is difficult to correct in patients with cystic fibrosis, and an impaired EFA metabolism with reduced synthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids has been proposed. In this study, the effects of an oral energy supplement rich in linoleic acid were investigated in patients with cystic fibrosis who had a body weight below 95% of normal for height. METHODS: Thirty-six patients (16 girls) more than 4 years of age were randomized either to a control group (n = 20, age 13.3 +/- 3.8 years, mean +/- SD) receiving intensive dietary counseling only, or an intervention group (n = 16, age, 10.4 +/- 4.3 years) treated for 3 months with dietary counseling plus 628 +/- 254 mL (= kcal) per day of an energy supplement rich in fat (31% of energy) and linoleic acid (16% of energy). RESULTS: In contrast to the control group, the patients with supplemented diets achieved significant increases of energy intake (2189 +/- 731 kcal/day vs. 2733 +/- 762 kcal/day), weight for height (82.8% +/- 8.6% vs. 84.8% +/- 9.6% of normal), and body fat (5.1 +/- 1.7 kg vs. 5.8 +/- 2.2 kg) as well as the initially low values of plasma phospholipid linoleic acid (11.8% +/- 1.1% vs. 17.6% +/- 1.6% of total phospholipid fatty acids) and its main metabolite arachidonic acid (4.4% +/- 0.4% vs. 5.9% +/- 0.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cystic fibrosis with low body weight and poor EFA status benefit from EFA-rich energy supplements and can synthesize arachidonic acid from the precursor linoleic acid.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Limited evidence gives support to an hypothesis suggesting that the symptoms of schizophrenia may result from altered neuronal membrane structure and metabolism. The latter are dependent on blood plasma levels of certain essential fatty acids (EFAs) and their metabolites. Several studies have shown those with schizophrenia often have low levels of the particular EFAs necessary for normal nerve cell membrane metabolism. OBJECTIVES: To review the effects of supplementing standard antipsychotic treatment with polyunsaturated fatty acids, whether essential (EFAs) or non-essential, for those with schizophrenia and, in recent updates to also evaluate the effects of EFA's as a sole antipsychotic treatment. To evaluate the relative efficacy of different types of fatty acid supplementation. SEARCH STRATEGY: Relevant randomised trials were identified by searching the following electronic databases: Biological Abstracts (1985-1998), CINAHL (1982-1998), Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 1999), Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (February 2000), EMBASE (1980-1998), MEDLINE (1966-1998) and PsycLIT (1974-1998). In addition, reviewers searched references of included and excluded studies and contacted authors to identify further studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised clinical trials of polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation to standard treatment or as primary intervention for schizophrenia (however defined) versus standard care. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Reviewers evaluated data independently and analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. They assumed that people who left the study early or were lost to follow-up had no improvement. Where possible and appropriate relative risk (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. The number needed to treat (NNT) was estimated. For continuous data weighted mean differences (WMD) and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Data were inspected for heterogeneity and publication biases. MAIN RESULTS: Four relatively small trials (total n=204) showed low levels of loss to follow up and adverse effects for those taking essential fatty acids. Early results from a few trials suggest a positive effect of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) over placebo for scale-derived mental state outcomes. The data, however, is limited making these results difficult to analyse and interpret with confidence. A single small study (n=30) investigated the value of using EPA as sole treatment for people hospitalised for relapse. Results suggest that EPA may help one third of people avoid instigation of standard antipsychotic drugs for 12 weeks (RR 0.6, CI 0.4-0.91). There were no clear effects of primrose oil (omega-6) EFA supplementation. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: All data are preliminary, but results look encouraging for fish oil. EPA does not seem harmful, may be acceptable to people with schizophrenia and have moderately positive effect. A further trial is soon to be reported from the USA and more are underway or planned in the South Africa and Norway. Considering that EPA may be an acceptable intervention, large, long simple studies reporting clincially meaningful data should be anticipated.",

      "abstract": "Several studies have shown that the activities of delta-6-desaturase and delta-5-desaturase are depressed in experimental diabetes and in humans with insulin- and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type I and type II diabetes mellitus respectively). Furthermore, treatment with insulin is known to correct the defects in desaturases in rats and humans with diabetes, especially in type I. In a recent study, we demonstrated that L-arginine and nitric oxide can prevent alloxan-induced beta cell damage, and the severity of diabetes, and restore the antioxidant status to near normal levels. But, no information is available as to the relationship between L-arginine-nitric oxide system and the metabolism of essential fatty acids in diabetes mellitus. In the present study, it was noted that the plasma levels of saturated fatty acids: stearic and palmitic were increased where as unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic, linoleic, gamma-linolenic and eicosapentaenoic acids (OA, LA, GLA and EPA respectively) were decreased in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. In the liver phospholipid (PL) fraction, GLA, DGLA (dihomo-GLA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) were decreased in the alloxan-treated group; in the muscle PL fraction, LA, GLA and DGLA were low, whereas an increase in the saturated fatty acid content was noted. L-arginine (the precursor of nitric oxide) and sodium nitroprusside (a nitric oxide donor) treatment of alloxan-induced diabetic rats enhanced the levels of LA, GLA and DGLA. Further, nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, L-NMMA, prevented this beneficial action of L-arginine-nitric oxide system on essential fatty acid metabolism. The abnormalities in the essential fatty acid metabolism observed also reverted to normalcy following control of diabetes with insulin. These results indicate that nitric oxide can enhance the activities of delta-6- and delta-5 desaturases, which are depressed in diabetes, and suggests that there is a close interaction between L-arginine-nitric oxide system and the metabolism of essential fatty acids.",

      "abstract": "Recent research suggests that deficient uptake or excessive breakdown of membrane phospholipids may be associated with schizophrenia. We review available clinical research on abnormalities in membrane fatty acid composition and metabolism in schizophrenia, and therapeutic trials of fatty acid in this disorder. All potentially relevant English-language articles were identified from the medical and psychiatric literature with the aid of computer searches using key words such as lipids, phospholipids, prostaglandins and schizophrenia. All studies which include human subjects are reviewed. Empirical studies related to membrane hypotheses of schizophrenia focus on: 1) assessment of prostaglandins (PG) and their essential fatty acid (EFA) precursors in the tissues of patients with schizophrenia; 2) evaluation of the niacin flush test as a possible diagnostic marker; 3) evaluation of phospholipase enzyme activity; 4) NMR spectroscopy studies of brain phospholipid metabolism; and 5) therapeutic trials of PG precursors for the treatment of schizophrenia. The most consistent clinical findings include red blood cell fatty acid membrane abnormalities, NMR spectroscopy evidence of increased phospholipid turnover and a therapeutic effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation of neuroleptic treatment in some schizophrenia patients. Studies of EFA metabolism have proved fruitful for generating and testing novel etiologic hypotheses and new therapeutic agents for schizophrenia. Greater attention to factors that influence tissue EFA levels such as diet, tobacco and alcohol are required to reconcile inconsistent findings. Treatment studies, although promising, require independent replication.",

      "abstract": "Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the diagnosis used to describe children who are inattentive, impulsive, and hyperactive. ADHD is a widespread condition that is of public health concern. In most children with ADHD the cause is unknown, but is thought to be biological and multifactorial. Several previous studies indicated that some physical symptoms reported in ADHD are similar to symptoms observed in essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency in animals and humans deprived of EFAs. We reported previously that a subgroup of ADHD subjects reporting many symptoms indicative of EFA deficiency (L-ADHD) had significantly lower proportions of plasma arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid than did ADHD subjects with few such symptoms or control subjects. In another study using contrast analysis of the plasma polar lipid data, subjects with lower compositions of total n-3 fatty acids had significantly more behavioral problems, temper tantrums, and learning, health, and sleep problems than did those with high proportions of n-3 fatty acids. The reasons for the lower proportions of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) in these children are not clear; however, factors involving fatty acid intake, conversion of EFAs to LCPUFA products, and enhanced metabolism are discussed. The relation between LCPUFA status and the behavior problems that the children exhibited is also unclear. We are currently testing this relation in a double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention in a population of children with clinically diagnosed ADHD who exhibit symptoms of EFA deficiency.",

To study whether an oral supplementation with omega-6 (n-6) EFAs would restore deranged plasma EFAs and ameliorate skin symptoms, 9 and 7 dialysis patients were randomly assigned to receive either gamma-linolenic acid (GLA)-rich evening primrose oil (EPO) or linoleic acid (LA) (2 g/day each) for 6 weeks. Plasma concentrations of EFA were analyzed by gas chromatography and uremic skin symptoms were assessed for dryness, pruritus and erythema by questionnaire and visual inspection in a double-blind manner. The patients given EPO exhibited a significant (p < 0.05) increase in plasma dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (a precursor of anti-inflammatory prostaglandin E1) with no concomitant change in plasma arachidonic acid (a precursor of pro-inflammatory prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4). In contrast, those given LA exhibited a significant (p < 0.05) increase in LA but not in any other n-6 EFAs, whereas they exhibited a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in plasma docosahexaenoic acid. The patients given EPO showed a significant (p < 0.05) improvement in the skin scores for the three different uremic skin symptoms over the baseline values and a trend toward a greater improvement (0.05 < p < 0.1) in pruritus scores than those given LA. Results indicate that GLA-rich EPO would be a more favorable supplemental source than LA in terms of shifting eicosanoid metabolism toward a less inflammation status through modifying plasma concentrations of their precursor n-6 EFAs. Further studies are required to confirm the efficacy and safety of EPO therapy for the treatment of uremic pruritus.",

High intake of saturated fats or non-EFAs, conditions that may induce EFA deficiency (EFAD) increase the risk of bladder cancer in case-control studies. In other cell populations, EFAs are beneficial as preventive and therapeutic nutrients for the treatment of cancer.

      "abstract": "In order to understand the mechanisms by which fatty acids are taken up by the placenta, the uptake of oleic, linoleic, arachidonic, and docosahexaenoic acids by cultured human placental choriocarcinoma (BeWo) cells was examined. Fatty acid uptake by BeWo cells was temperature-dependent and exhibited saturable kinetics. Oleic acid was taken up least and docosahexaenoic acid most by these cells. Moreover, competitive studies of fatty acid uptake by BeWo cells also indicated preferential uptake compared with oleic acid in the order of docosahexaenoic acid, arachidonic acid, and linoleic acid. Western blot analysis demonstrated that BeWo cells express a protein immunoreactive with antibodies to the human placental plasma membrane fatty acid-binding protein (p-FABPpm). Furthermore, pre-treatment of BeWo cells with these antibodies inhibited most of the uptake of docosahexaenoic (64%) and arachidonic acids (68%) whereas oleic acid uptake was inhibited only 32% compared with the controls treated with preimmune serum. These results clearly demonstrate that the pFABPpm may be involved in the preferential uptake of essential fatty acids (EFA) and their long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) by these cells. Studies on the distribution of radiolabeled fatty acids in the cellular lipids of BeWo cells showed that docosahexaenoic acid was incorporated mainly in the triacylglycerol fraction, followed by the phospholipid fraction, whereas for arachidonic acid the reverse was true. The preferential incorporation of docosahexaenoic acid into triacylglycerol suggests that triacylglycerol may play an important role in the placental transport of docosahexaenoic acid to the fetal circulation. Together these results demonstrate the preferential uptake of EFA/LCPUFA by BeWo cells that is most probably mediated via the pFABPpm. We thus propose that the p-FABPpm may be involved in the sequestration of maternal plasma LCPUFA by the placenta.",

      "abstract": "Malassezia furfur is important in the pathogenesis of a number of dermatologic diseases including seborrheic dermatitis in adults. It has also recently been suggested that M. furfur might be the etiologic agent in infantile seborrheic dermatitis (ISD). We studied the presence of M. furfur in 21 children with the clinical diagnosis of infantile seborrheic dermatitis. Laboratory analyses showed aberrant patterns of essential fatty acids (EFA) in serum characterized by elevated levels of 18:1w9 and 20:2w6. Samples for M. furfur were taken from the foreheads and chests of children with infantile seborrheic dermatitis at the time of diagnosis, directly after treatment to complete healing, and after 1 year with no signs of infantile seborrheic dermatitis. All the patients were treated topically with borage oil containing 25% gammalinolenic acid (GLA). No reduced growth of M. furfur was seen on contact plates prepared with borage oil. The growth of M. furfur seems not to be related to the clinical symptoms in ISD.",

      "abstract": "Depletion of Ca2+ pools using the irreversible Ca2+ pump blocker, thapsigargin, induces DDT1MF-2 smooth muscle cells to enter a stable nonproliferative state. Reversal of this state can be mediated by high (20%) serum treatment, which induces new Ca2+ pump protein, return of Ca2+ pools, and reentry of cells into the cell cycle; the effect of serum can be mimicked by the essential fatty acids (EFA), arachidonic, linoleic, and alpha-linolenic acids (Graber, M.N., Alfonso, A., and Gill, D.L., (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 883-888). The possible requirement for EFA metabolism in inducing recovery of Ca2+ pool-depleted growth-arrested cells was investigated. Neither cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase inhibitors had any effect on arachidonic acid-induced growth recovery of thapsigargin-treated cells. In contrast, the cytochrome P-450 epoxygenase inhibitors, SKF525A and metyrapone, substantially reduced arachidonic acid-induced recovery of growth while having minimal effects on control cell growth. Both epoxygenase inhibitors completely prevented the arachidonic acid-induced recovery of bradykinin-releasable Ca2+-pumping pools, whereas cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitors had no effect. The effectiveness of the four cytochrome P-450 metabolites of arachidonic acid on recovery of Ca2+ pools were compared; 8,9- and 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) at 1.5 microM were completely effective in recovering agonist-sensitive Ca2+ pools, whereas the 5,6- and 14,15-EETs were without effect. SKF525A did not block the action of 8,9- or 11, 12-EET indicating further P-450 metabolism was not required. Hydration of the active EET molecules prevented Ca2+ pool recovery since the dihydroxy-derivatives of both 8,9- and 11,12-EET were ineffective. The specificity of effectiveness among EET molecules for subsequent resumption of growth of thapsigargin-treated cells was the same as for Ca2+ pool recovery. Significantly, the P-450 inhibitors, SKF525A and metyrapone, both prevented the action of 20% serum in inducing recovery of thapsigargin-treated cells, whereas cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitors were ineffective, indicating that EFAs are the active component within serum that is responsible for recovery of Ca2+ pool-depleted cells. The specific action of EETs in mediating recovery of Ca2+ pools and growth of thapsigargin-treated cells represents not only a novel action of epoxygenase products from EFAs, but also a potentially significant new signaling pathway that may effect translational control and regulate transition from a stationary to proliferative growth state.",
