      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Persistent physical symptoms (PPS), including (primary) pain, can, according to Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (EAET), be precipitated, perpetuated, and prolonged by emotional processes related to unresolved trauma and psychosocial conflicts. EAET is a novel, short-term, psychodynamic- and emotion-focused psychological treatment that targets these etiological factors, intending to substantially reduce or eliminate pain and/or somatic symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This article provides an overview of EAET's theoretical background, core treatment principles, and empirical evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in alleviating somatic symptoms in people with PPS. Moreover, the potential of EAET and future research directions are discussed. METHODS: We report a selective literature review synthesizing the foundations and treatment characteristics of EAET and the findings from RCTs investigating EAET since 2017. RESULTS: Grounded in psychodynamic theory, with influences from affective neuroscience and emotion-focused therapy, the core treatment principles are reframing symptom explanations, fostering emotional processing, and facilitating corrective interpersonal experiences. EAET has been implemented in various formats, including individual therapy, group therapy, and internet-administered self-help. Since 2017, seven RCTs have been published, demonstrating efficacy in reducing symptoms, which appears superior to cognitive-behavioral therapy. CONCLUSION: EAET is particularly effective for treating chronic (primary) pain conditions such as fibromyalgia and musculoskeletal pain. However, further studies are required to evaluate its long-term efficacy, determine patient characteristics associated with positive outcomes, and better understand its most active mechanisms."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nearly half of individuals who sustain orthopaedic trauma develop chronic pain and experience significant levels of depression and anxiety. Emotional awareness and expression therapy (EAET) is a newly developed psychological intervention designed to treat chronic pain by helping patients process psychological trauma and conflict to reduce pain. The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of delivering EAET to individuals who sustained traumatic orthopaedic injuries requiring surgery and who have chronic pain 6 months after hospital discharge. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study will consist of a single-arm design. Thirty individuals who sustained traumatic orthopaedic injuries requiring surgery and who reported chronic pain 6 months after hospital discharge will be recruited. Participants will receive eight sessions of individually administered EAET delivered via telehealth and complete self-report questionnaires at three timepoints (pretreatment, post-treatment and 3-month follow-up). Quantitative sensory testing will also be done before and after treatment. The primary outcome of the study is feasibility (eg, per cent of eligible patients recruited and per cent of study completers) and acceptability as reported by responses to a self-report questionnaire. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board. All data are expected to be collected by 2026, with results of this study to be disseminated via relevant peer-reviewed journals and scientific conferences.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We examined whether the treatment effects from a previous RCT of Internet-delivered Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (I-EAET) for somatic symptom disorder were maintained 12 months after treatment. METHOD: 12-month assessments of self-reported somatic symptoms, pain severity, and several secondary outcomes were compared with baseline and post-treatment levels within the I-EAET condition only, given that the waitlist control condition had already received treatment. Twenty-eight out of the original 37 participants (76%) in the I-EAET condition provided follow-up data. RESULTS: The beneficial effects of I-EAET on somatic symptoms observed at post-treatment were maintained at the 12-month follow-up (d = -0.22, 95% CI: -0.72 to 0.28), as well as for pain intensity (d = -0.02, 95% CI: -0.52 to 0.48). From pre-treatment to 12-month follow-up, there was a medium effect on somatic symptoms (d = 0.74, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.24), and a small, non-significant effect for pain intensity (d = 0.43, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.93). Response rates (at least 50% symptom reduction) at 12-month follow-up were 25% for somatic symptoms, and 12% for pain intensity. CONCLUSION: I-EAET seems to have positive long-term effects for somatic symptom disorder. Larger studies with controls and comparisons to other treatments are needed."

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Chronic pain is common and disabling in older adults, and psychological interventions are indicated. However, the gold standard approach, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), produces only modest benefits, and more powerful options are needed. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether emotional awareness and expression therapy (EAET) is superior to CBT for treatment of chronic pain among predominantly male older veterans and whether higher baseline depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms-key targets of EAET-moderate treatment response. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 2-arm randomized clinical trial was conducted from May 16, 2019, to September 14, 2023, in the US Department of Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System. The trial included a racially and ethnically diverse group of veterans aged 60 to 95 years with at least 3 months of musculoskeletal pain. INTERVENTIONS: Emotional awareness and expression therapy or CBT, conducted concurrently, each presented as one 90-minute individual session followed by eight 90-minute group sessions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was Brief Pain Inventory pain severity (range, 0 to 10) from baseline to posttreatment (week 10, primary end point) and 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included Patient Reported Outcomes Institute Measurement System Anxiety, Depression, Fatigue, General Life Satisfaction (NIH Toolbox), Pain Interference, and Sleep Disturbance Short Forms, Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), and Satisfaction with Therapy and Therapist Scale-Revised. A subset of participants completed the PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition). All analyses were for the intention-to-treat population and included all randomized participants. RESULTS: Among 126 randomized participants (66 in the EAET group and 60 in the CBT group; mean [SD] age, 71.9 [5.9] years; 116 [92%] male), 111 (88%) completed posttreatment, and 104 (82%) completed the 6-month follow-up. The EAET was superior to CBT for the primary outcome of reduction in pain severity at posttreatment (estimate, -1.59 [95% CI, -2.35 to -0.83]; P < .001) and follow-up (estimate, -1.01 [95% CI, -1.78 to -0.24]; P = .01). A greater percentage of participants in EAET vs CBT had clinically significant (at least 30%) pain reduction (63% vs 17%; odds ratio, 21.54 [95% CI, 4.66-99.56]; P < .001) at posttreatment. In addition, EAET was superior to CBT on 50% pain reduction (35% vs 7%; odds ratio, 11.77 [95% CI, 2.38-58.25]; P = .002), anxiety (estimate, -2.49 [95% CI, -4.30 to -0.68]; P = .006), depression (estimate, -3.06 [95% CI, -5.88 to -0.25]; P = .03), general life satisfaction (estimate, 1.23 [95% CI, 0.36-2.10]; P = .005), PTSD symptoms (estimate, -4.39 [95% CI, -8.44 to -0.34]; P = .03), PGIC score (estimate, 1.46 [95% CI, 0.77-2.15]; P < .001), and global treatment satisfaction (estimate, 0.28 [95% CI, 0.12-0.45]; P < .001) at posttreatment. Higher baseline depression (estimate, -1.55 [95% CI, -0.37 to 2.73]; P < .001), anxiety (estimate, -1.53 [95% CI, -2.19 to -0.88]; P < .001), and PTSD symptoms (estimate, -1.69 [95% CI, -2.96 to -0.42]; P = .009) moderated greater reduction in pain severity after EAET but not CBT. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this randomized clinical trial suggest that EAET may be a preferred intervention for medically and psychiatrically complex patients with pain. The societal burden of chronic pain could be improved by further incorporating the principles of EAET into mainstream clinical pain medicine.

      "abstract": "School refusal (SR) is commonly associated with somatic symptoms that are temporally related to school attendance. Abdominal pain, headache, vomiting, and musculoskeletal pain are frequently encountered and are usually not caused by a physical disease. School refusers, parents and health care workers are often puzzled by these impairing symptoms. In this qualitative study, we assessed somatic symptoms in a population encompassing both school refusers and their parents. We aimed at better understanding experiences and strategies in the management of these debilitating symptoms, while also investigating the journey of these symptoms and their behavioral consequences on the said population. We conducted qualitative interviews both within an Integrated Youth Health Care Unit in Paris and through a French parent-led support group improving care for school refusers. We interviewed 19 young persons with SR (aged 6-21 years old) and 20 parents. Using the Grounded Theory, three themes were identified: (1) somatic symptoms' journey in four phases (emergence, coping, crisis, and disappearance in the context of school dropout); (2) their deconstruction, indicating the patients' emotional state; and (3) their management through self-care practices as well as increased emotional and body awareness. Some parents, who could portray similar symptoms at a younger age, mentioned familial pattern of heightened emotional and sensorial sensitivity as a possible cause. Findings suggested that somatic symptoms in SR offer an insight into the patients' emotional state. We recommend that psychotherapies targeting somatic symptoms could be further assessed in SR, along with educational content aimed at increasing emotional literacy in schools and health care settings.",

This article first presents a targeted literature review focused on emotional expressions in psychotherapy and implementing psychodynamic therapy over telehealth and then describes our clinical experience transitioning a psychodynamically-informed, evidence-based, and experiential group treatment for chronic pain, emotional awareness and expression therapy (EAET), to video telehealth at VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System. We discuss barriers we encountered in our implementation of EAET over video telehealth but also illustrate the ultimate success of the approach using verbatim excerpts from our therapeutic work, which aim to demonstrate the potential to facilitate powerful emotional expressions over video telehealth when conducting a psychodynamically-informed treatment. We examine the possible applications for video telehealth to maintain emotionally focused, psychodynamic psychotherapy administration and enhance its teaching and training. Although we describe limitations of our specific approach, ultimately, our experience supports the potential efficacy of experiential, emotion-focused psychodynamic therapies in a telehealth setting."

This uncontrolled pilot assessed acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of group-based video telehealth EAET (vEAET) for older veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain. METHODS: Twenty veterans were screened, and 16 initiated vEAET, delivered as one 60-minute individual session and eight 90-minute group sessions. Veterans completed posttreatment satisfaction ratings and pain severity (primary outcome), pain interference, anxiety, depression, functioning, social connectedness, shame, and anger questionnaires at baseline, posttreatment, and 2-month follow-up. RESULTS: Satisfaction was high, and veterans attended 7.4 (SD = 0.6) of 8 group sessions; none discontinued treatment. Veterans attained significant, large reductions in pain severity from baseline to posttreatment (p < .001, Hedges' g = -1.54) and follow-up (p < .001, g = -1.20); 14 of 16 achieved clinically significant (≥ 30%) pain reduction, and 3 achieved 90-100% pain reduction. Secondary outcomes demonstrated significant, medium-to-large improvements. CONCLUSIONS: In this small sample, vEAET produced better attendance, similar benefits, and fewer dropouts than in-person EAET in prior studies. Larger, controlled trials are needed.

We developed a novel, single-session, telehealth-delivered EAET class (\"Pain, Stress, and Emotions\"; PSE) and tested it on adults with chronic pain of mixed etiology. METHODS: After an initial developmental phase, we conducted an uncontrolled trial, providing PSE to 74 individuals with chronic pain (63.5% female; 64.9% White; 60.8% with pain duration >5 years) in four class administrations. Participants completed self-report measures (primary outcomes: pain intensity and pain interference) at baseline and multiple follow-ups to 12 weeks. Linear mixed-models examined changes over time, and effect sizes were calculated on change from baseline to 4-week (primary endpoint) and 12-week follow-ups. The trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05014126). RESULTS: Participants reported high satisfaction with the PSE class. Pain intensity showed a significant, medium reduction across time (p < .001; d = 0.60 at 4 weeks); one-quarter of participants had clinically meaningful pain reduction (≥30%). Pain interference had a large reduction (p < .001; d = 0.74). There were significant but smaller improvements in most secondary outcomes (ds = 0.15 to 0.55; ps < .01). Effects were generally maintained or increased at 12-week follow-up. Higher education and baseline ambivalence over emotional expression predicted greater pain reductions. CONCLUSIONS: People taking this EAET class had reduced pain severity and interference and improvements in other pain-related outcomes. The single-session, telehealth class holds promise as an easily delivered, efficient, and potentially impactful intervention for some patients with chronic pain, although controlled trials are needed."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is commonly encountered in health care settings. Cognitive-behavioural treatments have been most extensively studied, but they tend to have small effects of temporary duration. Emotional awareness and expression therapy (EAET) is a newly developed treatment for SSD, targeting emotional processing of trauma and conflict as a mechanism of symptom change. In an earlier uncontrolled study of self-guided, internet-administrated EAET (I-EAET), we found substantial reductions in somatic symptoms, prompting the need for a randomized controlled trial of I-EAET. METHODS: We conducted a 2-arm RCT, comparing 10-week I-EAET (n = 37) to a waitlist control (WL; n = 37). Primary outcomes were reductions of somatic symptoms (PHQ-15) and pain intensity (BPI-4) at post-treatment, with a 4-month evaluation of effect duration. We also analysed emotional processing (EPS-25) and depression (PHQ-9) as possible mediators of I-EAET's effects. RESULTS: Compared to controls, I-EAET significantly reduced somatic symptoms at both post-treatment and follow-up. I-EAET also reduced pain, depression, insomnia, and anxiety at post-treatment, but these effects were not retained at follow-up. As hypothesized, a facet of emotional processing partially mediated the treatment effect on somatic symptoms, even when controlling for depression. CONCLUSIONS: Although treatment effects were smaller than in the previous uncontrolled trial, I-EAET is a promising treatment for SSD, with a minority of patients (around 20%) experiencing substantial clinical improvement. The benefits of I-EAET are partially mediated by improved emotional processing. Future research should identify and target patients who respond best to I-EAET and develop tailored treatment to enhance treatment effects. (Preregistered at clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04751825.).",

RESULTS: The main goal of the 'Centre for Integral Rehabilitation (CIR) Excellent' IMPT is to improve daily functioning, participation and quality of life of patients with CMP by helping them to adapt their behaviour so as to better manage their symptoms. A combination of physical and psychosocial treatment methods is employed, including Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (EAET), Pain Neuroscience Education (PNE), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), graded activity, exposure in vivo, and experiential learning through physical training. The interdisciplinary treatment team comprises physiotherapists, psychologists and a physiatrist. The programme lasts 10 weeks (61 h in total) and consists of three phases: a start (Week 1), education (Weeks 2-3), and skills learning phase (Weeks 4-10). Patients come in twice a week and participate in 2-4 sessions (3-4 h) per treatment day. The programme consists of both individual (physical and mental coaching) and group sessions (education, movement and behaviour outdoors/indoors). Individualisation through personal goal-setting is an important characteristic of the treatment, as well as frequent interdisciplinary consultation between care providers.",

      "abstract": "A single session of Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (EAET)-the EAET Interview-was previously shown to lead to clinical benefits for patients with centralized somatic conditions in primary care (Ziadni et al. in Health Psychol 37(3):282-290, 2018) and tertiary care (Carty et al. in Pain Med 20(7):1321-1329, 2019) settings. There has yet to be an examination of patients' experiences of and reactions to the EAET Interview, which is crucial in evaluating possible clinical implementation of the interview. We conducted secondary analyses on 88 patients (M age = 41.32, 90.9% women) from the two prior trials (primary care N = 51; tertiary care N = 37). Analyses examined interview processes (stress disclosure themes, working alliance, and emotional processing) and patients' reactions to the interview (interview credibility and perceived value of the interview), comparing the two samples and examining correlations among these variables. All patients disclosed at least one stressful life experience, commonly interpersonal problems (89.2%) and childhood adversity (51.5%). Patients had moderately high levels of working alliance and emotional processing during the interview and reported high interview credibility and perceived value of the interview. More extensive emotional processing of stressors was associated with more positive patient reactions to the interview, including higher interview credibility (r = .23) and perceived value (r = .32). We conclude that the single-session EAET Interview was valued by most patients, and patients' emotional processing is particularly beneficial. Addressing the trauma and emotional conflicts of patients with centralized somatic conditions is both feasible and valuable in front-line medical settings.",

      "abstract": "Chronic pain remains a serious healthcare challenge, particularly for older adults who suffer substantial disability and are susceptible to serious risks from pain medications and invasive procedures. Psychotherapy is a promising option for older adults with chronic pain, since it does not contribute to medical or surgical risks. However, standard psychotherapies for chronic pain, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), acceptance and commitment therapy, and mindfulness-based interventions, produce only modest and time-limited benefits for older adults. In this article, we describe a novel, evidence-based psychological assessment and treatment approach for older adults with chronic pain, including a detailed case example. The approach begins with reviewing patients' pain, psychosocial, and medical histories to elicit evidence of a subtype of chronic pain called centralized (primary, nociplastic, or psychophysiologic) pain, which is highly influenced and may even be caused by life stress, emotions, and alterations in brain function. Patients then undertake a novel psychotherapy approach called emotional awareness and expression therapy (EAET) that aims to reduce or eliminate centralized pain by resolving trauma and emotional conflicts and learning healthy communication of adaptive emotions. Our published preliminary clinical trial (n = 53) indicated that EAET produced statistically significant and large effect size advantages over CBT in pain reduction and marginally greater improvements in pain interference than CBT for older adults with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Geriatric mental healthcare providers may learn this assessment and treatment approach to benefit many of their patients with chronic pain.",

Methods: Participants (N = 52) engaged in a 9-week I-EAET treatment. Before treatment and each week during treatment (i.e., 10 weekly measurements), emotional processing was assessed with the Emotional Processing Scale-25 (EPS-25), which contains five subscales, and somatic symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15). Results: Mediation analyses using linear mixed models showed that two EPS-25 subscales-Signs of Unprocessed Emotions and Impoverished Emotional Experience-were uniquely associated with somatic symptom reduction. The proportion of the mediated effect was 0.49, indicating that about half of the total association of the PHQ-15 with symptoms was accounted for by the two EPS-25 subscales. Conclusion: This preliminary mediation analysis suggests that improved emotional processing is associated with change in somatic symptoms in I-EAET. However, randomized controlled and comparison trials are needed to establish that I-EAET creates the change in emotional processing and that such changes are specific to I-EAET."

      "abstract": "Background: There is growing evidence that trauma, psychosocial conflict, and difficulties with emotional processing contribute to centralized somatic symptoms. Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (EAET) was developed to address these factors and reduce symptoms, and EAET has shown efficacy in face-to-face formats. No trial of an internet-delivered EAET (I-EAET) exists, however, so we developed such an intervention and conducted an uncontrolled feasibility and potential efficacy trial of I-EAET for patients with Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD) with centralized symptoms (SSD-CS). Method: After screening potential participants, a sample of 52 patients (50 women, two men; age M = 49.6, SD = 11.9) diagnosed with SSD-CS initiated treatment. I-EAET consisted of nine weekly modules focused on psychoeducation, emotional awareness and exposure, and anxiety regulation with self-compassion. Therapists communicated with each patient by email for about 20 min per week during treatment, answering questions and giving feedback on homework assignments. Patients completed measures of somatic symptoms, depression, anxiety, trauma-related symptoms, and functional disability before treatment and again at post-treatment and 4-month follow-up. Results: A large reduction in somatic symptoms (PHQ-15) occurred pre-to post-treatment (d = 1.13; 95% CI: 0.84-1.47) which was fully maintained at 4-month follow-up (d = 1.19; 95% CI: 0.88-1.56). Twenty-three percent of the patients at post-treatment and 27% at follow-up achieved a 50% or greater reduction in somatic symptoms, and about 70% achieved a minimally important clinical difference. In addition, at post-treatment, there were small to medium reductions (d's from 0.33 to 0.72) in anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), trauma-related symptoms (PCL-5), and functional disability (Sheehan Disability Scale). For all of these secondary outcomes, improvements were slightly to substantially larger at follow-up than at post-treatment (d's from 0.46 to 0.80). Conclusion: I-EAET appears to be a feasible treatment for adults with SSD and centralized symptoms, resulting in substantial and durable improvement not only in somatic symptoms but in other psychiatric symptoms and functioning. Controlled trials are needed determine the effects of I-EAET specifically and how this approach compares to face-to-face EAET and to other internet-delivered treatments, such as cognitive-behavioral interventions. Research should also identify treatment responders and mechanisms of change in EAET. Clinical Trial Registration: www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT04122846."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Emotional awareness and expression therapy (EAET) emphasizes the importance of the central nervous system and emotional processing in the etiology and treatment of chronic pain. Prior trials suggest EAET can substantially reduce pain; however, only one has compared EAET with an established alternative, demonstrating some small advantages over cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for fibromyalgia. The current trial compared EAET with CBT in older, predominately male, ethnically diverse veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain. DESIGN: Randomized comparison trial. SETTING: Outpatient clinics at the West Los Angeles VA Medical Center. SUBJECTS: Fifty-three veterans (mean age = 73.5 years, 92.4% male) with chronic musculoskeletal pain. METHODS: Patients were randomized to EAET or CBT, each delivered as one 90-minute individual session and eight 90-minute group sessions. Pain severity (primary outcome), pain interference, anxiety, and other secondary outcomes were assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and three-month follow-up. RESULTS: EAET produced significantly lower pain severity than CBT at post-treatment and follow-up; differences were large (partial η2 = 0.129 and 0.157, respectively). At post-treatment, 41.7% of EAET patients had >30% pain reduction, one-third had >50%, and 12.5% had >70%. Only one CBT patient achieved at least 30% pain reduction. Secondary outcomes demonstrated small to medium effect size advantages of EAET over CBT, although only post-treatment anxiety reached statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: This trial, although preliminary, supports prior research suggesting that EAET may be a treatment of choice for many patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Psychotherapy may achieve substantial pain reduction if pain neuroscience principles are emphasized and avoided emotions are processed.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Quantitative sensory testing may help predict treatment responses in individuals with chronic pain. Our objective was to determine whether evoked pain sensitivity at baseline predicted preferential treatment responses to either emotional awareness and expression therapy (EAET) or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in individuals with fibromyalgia (FM). METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of a previous randomized clinical trial, in which individuals with FM were randomized to EAET, CBT, or Education as a control intervention. Only females who completed baseline and post-treatment assessments were analyzed (n=196). The primary outcome was change in overall clinical pain severity from pretreatment to posttreatment, and the primary predictor of interest was pressure pain tolerance at baseline. RESULTS: Among patients with low pain tolerance at baseline (n=154), both EAET and CBT led to small but significant improvements in clinical pain severity (CBT mean=0.66, 95% confidence interval [0.24-1.07]; EAET mean=0.76 [0.34-1.17]). Conversely, in patients with normal pain tolerance (n=42), there was no significant improvement in clinical pain after CBT (0.13 [-0.88 to 1.14]), a small improvement after FM Education (0.81 [0.14-1.48]), but a much larger and statistically significant improvement after EAET (2.14 [1.23-3.04]). DISCUSSION: Normal levels of pressure pain tolerance at baseline predicted greater improvement in clinical pain severity after EAET than CBT. Quantitative sensory testing may provide insights about individual responses to psychologically based therapies for individuals with chronic pain.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with chronic pain, especially primary or centralized pain, have elevated rates of psychosocial trauma and intrapersonal or intrapsychic conflict. To address these risk factors and potentially reduce pain, the authors developed emotional awareness and expression therapy (EAET). This article presents the rationale for EAET, describes its principles and techniques, reviews its development and early testing as well as recent clinical trials, and critically analyzes the evidence base. RECENT FINDINGS: Four initial trials (between 2006 and 2011) demonstrated the efficacy of earlier versions of EAET. Four recent randomized, controlled trials of different EAET durations (1 to 8 sessions) and formats (individual or group) in patients with fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, pelvic pain, or medically unexplained symptoms support the earlier findings. EAET reliably reduces pain and interference, although improvements in anxiety and depression are less reliably achieved and may be delayed. The largest and best conducted trial found superiority of EAET over cognitive-behavioral therapy for fibromyalgia. Patient retention in EAET is high, and adverse events are rare. EAET merits inclusion as a treatment option for primary pain conditions, and it may be the preferred treatment for some patients. Research is needed on EAET with other pain conditions and samples, using better controls and comparison conditions, and on additional ways to motivate and help patients engage in successful emotional processing.",

A prior randomized controlled trial found that both relaxation training (RT) and emotional awareness and expression training (EAET) were superior to a waitlist control condition for IBS symptoms, quality of life, depression, and anxiety among IBS patients (Thakur et al., 2017). METHOD: We conducted secondary analyses on these data to examine potential moderators of treatment outcomes. Baseline measures of patients' ambivalence over emotional expression and perceived social constraints, which have been hypothesized to influence some treatments, were tested as possible moderators of the effects of RT and EAET, compared to the control condition. RESULTS: Results indicated that these variables moderated the effects of RT but not EAET. The benefits of RT occurred for patients who reported higher ambivalence over emotional expression or perceived social constraints, whereas the benefits of EAET were not influenced by these factors. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that RT might be particularly helpful for people who tend to avoid emotional disclosure and expression, supporting the possible benefit of targeting treatments to patient characteristics and preferences, whereas EAET might be helpful for a broader range of patients with IBS.",

      "abstract": "Patients with fibromyalgia (FM) experience increased lifetime levels of psychosocial adversity, trauma, and emotional conflict. To address these risk factors, we developed emotion awareness and expression therapy (EAET) and tested its benefits against an active control condition, FM education, and the field's gold standard intervention for FM, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for symptom management. Adults with FM (N = 230) formed 40 treatment groups, which were randomized to EAET, CBT, or education and given 8, 90-minute sessions. Patient-reported outcomes were assessed at baseline, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up (primary end point). Retention of patients to follow-up was excellent (90.4%). Intent-to-treat analyses indicated that although EAET did not differ from FM education on pain severity (primary outcome), EAET had significantly better outcomes than FM education on overall symptoms, widespread pain, physical functioning, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety, depression, positive affect, and life satisfaction (between-condition d's ranging from 0.29-0.45 SD) and the percentage of patients reporting being \"very much/much\" improved (34.8% vs 15.4%). Emotional awareness and expression therapy did not differ from CBT on the primary or most secondary outcomes, but compared to CBT, EAET led to significantly lower FM symptoms (d = 0.35) and widespread pain (d = 0.37) and a higher percentage of patients achieving 50% pain reduction (22.5% vs 8.3%). In summary, an intervention targeting emotional awareness and expression related to psychosocial adversity and conflict was well received, more effective than a basic educational intervention, and had some advantages over CBT on pain. We conclude that EAET should be considered as an additional treatment option for FM.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Current clinical guidelines identify several psychological treatments for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS patients, however, have elevated trauma, life stress, relationship conflicts, and emotional avoidance, which few therapies directly target. We tested the effects of emotional awareness and expression training (EAET) compared to an evidence-based comparison condition-relaxation training-and a waitlist control condition. METHODS: Adults with IBS (N=106; 80% female, Mean age=36 years) were randomized to EAET, relaxation training, or waitlist control. Both EAET and relaxation training were administered in three, weekly, 50-minute, individual sessions. All patients completed the IBS Symptom Severity Scale (primary outcome), IBS Quality of Life, and Brief Symptom Inventory (anxiety, depressive, and hostility symptoms) at pretreatment and at 2 weeks posttreatment and 10 weeks follow-up (primary endpoint). KEY RESULTS: Compared to waitlist controls, EAET, but not relaxation training, significantly reduced IBS symptom severity at 10-week follow-up. Both EAET and relaxation training improved quality of life at follow-up. Finally, EAET did not reduce psychological symptoms, whereas relaxation training reduced depressive symptoms at follow-up (and anxiety symptoms at posttreatment). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Brief emotional awareness and expression training that targeted trauma and emotional conflicts reduced somatic symptoms and improved quality of life in patients with IBS. This emotion-focused approach may be considered an additional treatment option for IBS, although research should compare EAET to a full cognitive-behavioral protocol and determine which patients are best suited for each approach.
