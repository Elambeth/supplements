      "abstract": "Chronic muscle and joint pain affect many people. However, current treatment options harbor a considerable risk of adverse drug reactions, which is why the search for other treatment alternatives is constantly expanding. As a result, research is also focusing on plant-based products. These include devil's claw, a medicinal plant from the sesame family, which is native to the African continent and is used there as a traditional remedy. In this study, 16 different criteria were selected for a critical analysis of devil's claw products, which included aspects such as drug-drug interactions, adverse drug reactions, and recommended daily dose, and 88 products were analyzed with the help of these criteria. Furthermore, products classified as food supplements, dietary supplements, and herbal medicinal products were compared with each other. Our goal was to analyze how consumers are informed, with a focus on consumer safety. The primary objective was not to analyze the actual ingredients of the products or to compare them based on their composition. The results almost invariably show the pharmaceutical reliability of herbal medicinal products. In contrast, products marketed as food supplements and dietary supplements have questionable reliability, as most products in these categories allow manufacturers more freedom and impose fewer controls and requirements. Devil's claw products labeled as food or dietary supplement show significant gaps in consumer information compared to herbal medicinal products. Product naming and packaging are often suggestive, potentially misleading consumers. Our study shows that food supplements and dietary supplements are clearly pursuing financial interests, and that consumer protection is often neglected in the process. The study analysis also revealed a limited number of clinical studies, no long-term studies, and poor methodological quality, undermining their reliability."

      "abstract": "Harpagophytum procumbens subsp. procumbens (Burch.) DC. ex Meisn. (Sesame seed Family-Pedaliaceae) is a popular medicinal plant known as Devil's claw. It is predominantly distributed widely over southern Africa. Its impressive reputation is embedded in its traditional uses as an indigenous herbal plant for the treatment of menstrual problems, bitter tonic, inflammation febrifuge, syphilis or even loss of appetite. A number of bioactive compounds such as terpenoids, iridoid glycosides, glycosides, and acetylated phenolic compounds have been isolated. Harpagoside and harpagide, iridoid glycosides bioactive compounds have been reported in countless phytochemical studies as potential anti-inflammatory agents as well as pain relievers. In-depth studies have associated chronic inflammation with various diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. In addition, 60% of chronic disorder fatalities are due to chronic inflammatory diseases worldwide. Inflammation and pain-related disorders have attracted significant attention as leading causes of global health challenges. Articles published from 2011 to the present were obtained and reviewed in-depth to determine valuable data findings as well as knowledge gaps. Various globally recognized scientific search engines/databases including Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect were utilized to collect information and deliver evidence. Based on the literature results, there was a dramatic decrease in the number of studies conducted on the anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity of Devil's claw, thereby presenting a potential research gap. It is also evident that currently in vivo clinical studies are needed to validate the prior massive in vitro studies, therefore delivering an ideal anti-inflammatory and analgesic agent in the form of H. procumbens products.",

      "abstract": "Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by abnormal keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation that is accompanied with dysregulated immune response and abnormal vascularization. Devil's claw (Harpagophytum procumbens (Burch.) DC. ex Meisn.) tubers extract has been used both systemically and topically for treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, osteoporosis, inflammatory bowel disease, among others. However, its potential mechanisms of action against psoriasis remains poorly investigated. The human keratinocyte HaCaT cell line is a well-accepted in vitro model system for inflammatory skin disorders such as psoriasis. The present study involved an exploration of the effect of biotechnologically produced H. procumbens (HP) cell suspension extract and pure phenylethanoid glycosides verbascoside (VER) and leucosceptoside A (LEU) in interferon (IFN)-γ/interleukin (IL)-17A/IL-22-stimulated HaCaT cells as a model of psoriasis-like inflammation. Changes in key inflammatory signaling pathways related to psoriasis development were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Treatment with LEU, but not VER and HP extract improved psoriasis-related inflammation via suppression of the PI3K/AKT signaling in IFN-γ/IL-17A/IL-22-stimulated HaCaT cells. Our results suggest that LEU may exhibit therapeutic potential against psoriasis by regulating keratinocyte differentiation through inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway.",

      "abstract": "Over 200 million people are exposed to arsenic worldwide in their daily lives. Arsenic is a toxic ubiquitous metalloid distributed in the ground water. From the last few decades it is obtaining considerable attention for its severe neurotoxic properties. In this study the neuroprotective efficacy of devil's claw (DCW), a potent antioxidant has been investigated against arsenic induced neurotoxicity in female rats. Neurotoxicity was established by oral administration of 13 mg/kg sodium arsenite. The animals were divided into five groups (n = 6) including normal control, disease/arsenic control, standard treatment (Apocynin, 10 mg/kg), DCW treatment I (DCW, 200 mg/kg) and DCW treatment II (DCW, 400 mg/kg). Exploratory, anxiety and motor coordination related behavior of the animals was assessed using hole-board, forced swimming, beam walk and elevated plus maze tests. Findings revealed that DCW treatment ameliorated anxiety and motor in-coordination in the rats compared to the arsenic control group. In addition, arsenic induced a significant oxidative stress in arsenic only treated group, whereas co-administration with DCW the oxidative stress was reduced prominently. Arsenic control group produced gliosis and nuclear pyknosis of the brain cells which were prominently suppressed with the treatment of DCW for 21 days. The activity of DCW was in correlation with the concentration of harpagoside in the serum estimated by the HPLC method, supports that harpagoside was the active constituent responsible for neuroprotective effect. Further findings are required to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in neuroprotective effect of harpagoside and DCW."

      "abstract": "Devil's claw is used for the treatment of inflammatory symptoms and degenerative disorders in horses since many years, but without the substantive pharmacokinetic data. The pharmacokinetic parameters of harpagoside, the main active constituent of Harpagophytum procumbens DC ex Meisn., were evaluated in equine plasma after administration of Harpagophytum extract FB 8858 in an open, single-dose, two-treatment, two-period, randomized cross-over design. Six horses received a single dose of Harpagophytum extract, corresponding to 5 mg/kg BM harpagoside, and after 7 days washout period, 10 mg/kg BM harpagoside via nasogastric tube. Plasma samples at certain time points (before and 0-24 hr after administration) were collected, cleaned up by solid-phase extraction, and harpagoside concentrations were determined by LC-MS/MS using apigenin-7-glucoside as internal standard. Plasma concentration-time data and relevant parameters were described by noncompartmental model through PKSolver software. Harpagoside could be detected up to 9 hr after administration. Cmax was found at 25.59 and 55.46 ng/ml, t1/2 at 2.53 and 2.32 hr, respectively, and tmax at 1 hr in both trials. AUC0-inf was 70.46 and 117.85 ng hr ml-1 , respectively. A proportional relationship between dose, Cmax and AUC was observed. Distribution (Vz /F) was 259.04 and 283.83 L/kg and clearance (CL/F) 70.96 and 84.86 L hr-1  kg-1 , respectively. Treatment of horses with Harpagophytum extract did not cause any clinically detectable side effects.",

      "abstract": "Devil's claw is a common ingredient in nutraceutical products for the treatment of inflammation due to arthritis. The secondary root extract of Harpagophymn piocumbens contains bioactive iridoid glycosides known as harpagosides. Recent scrutiny of the nutraceutical industry claims that products listing devil's claw on their labels should refer only to H. procumbens, while the closely related, and less expensive, H. zeyheri is not to be classified as devil's claw. .This assertion is in contrast to botanists who claim that either species of Harpagophytum can be generically referred to as devil's claw. The current research aimed to determine the chemical composition of extracts from H. procumbens and H. zeyheri, with the intent to identify whether the bioactive harpagosides were similarly present between species, and how their presence resembled or deviated from commercially available H. procumbens extracts commonly used in -nutraceutical products. A microwave extraction followed by high performance liquid chromatography analysis of root samples from botanical specimens of H. procimbens and H. zeyheri identified similar quantities of harpagoside, regardless of species. The chemical composition between root extracts for each.species was found to contain varying quantities of non-harpagoside constituents, however their harpagoside content was comparable. These findings are intended to inform policymakers, nutraceutical manufacturers, and the general public of the distinction between myth and reality regarding devil's claw supplements.",

Some of the taxa are appreciated for their medicinal effects and have been traditionally used to relieve symptoms of inflammation. The objectives of this pilot study were to investigate the antioxidant capacity and the content of total phenols, verbascoside, isoverbascoside, and selected iridoids, as well as to investigate the capacity of various Harpagophytum taxa in suppressing respiratory burst in terms of reactive oxygen species produced by human neutrophils challenged with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), opsonised Staphylococcus aureus, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Harpagophytum plants were classified into different taxa according to morphology, and DNA analysis was used to confirm the classification. A putative new variety of H. procumbens showed the highest degree of antioxidative capacity. Using PMA, three Harpagophytum taxa showed anti-inflammatory effects with regard to the PBS control. A putative hybrid between H. procumbens and H. zeyheri in contrast showed proinflammatory effect on the response of neutrophils to F. nucleatum in comparison with treatment with vehicle control. Harpagophytum taxa were biochemically very variable and the response in suppressing respiratory burst differed. Further studies with larger number of subjects are needed to corroborate anti-inflammatory effects of different taxa of Harpagophytum.",

Although the clinical efficacy in osteoarthritis has been demonstrated in clinical trials, the molecular target(s) of Hp are unclear. This study quantified the effects of the ethanol Hp extract (60% v/v ethanol, sole active ingredient of Pascoe®-Agil), on the expression and release of the major pro-inflammatory mediators in LPS-stimulated human monocytes and the intracellular signalling pathways involved in inflammation. The Hp extract dose-dependently inhibited the release of TNFα as well as that of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β and prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂). The Hp prevented TNFα and IL-6 mRNA expression in human monocytes and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in RAW 264.7 cells. Furthermore, the Hp extract inhibited LPS-stimulated AP-1-mediated gene transcription activity and binding to the AP-1 response elements. The extract had no effect on the LPS-induced binding of nuclear factor-κB in RAW 264.7 cells, on LPS-induced degradation of IκBα or on LPS-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), p38MAPK and JNK in human monocytes. The data indicate that a standardized ethanol Hp extract inhibits induction of pro-inflammatory gene expression, possibly by blocking the AP-1 pathway. This is novel evidence of a possible mechanism of action of this antiinflammatory drug.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cancer patients frequently use alternative therapies. Two follicular lymphoma patients who had objective tumour regression after taking Devil's Claw without cytotoxic therapy are reported here. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patient 1 presented with coexistent immunoglobulin G plasma cell dyscrasia and stage iiia lymphoma (nodes 5 cm in diameter). Computed tomography scan 10 months later showed partial regression. On enquiry, it was learned that the patient was taking Devil's Claw and Essiac (Essiac Products Services, Pompano Beach, FL, U.S.A.). This patient later developed overt myeloma, at which time he stopped the herbal supplements and underwent high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation, since which no lymphoma progression has occurred. Patient 2 presented with stage IIIA lymphoma (nodes 2.5 cm in diameter). He learned of patient 1 through our lymphoma patient support group and started Devil's Claw. Computed tomography scan 11 months later showed decreased adenopathy and splenomegaly, which has been sustained for 4 years. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Devil's Claw tuberous root has anti-inflammatory properties, probably through suppression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression. There are no prior reports of anticancer activity. Inhibition of COX-2 has a role in colon cancer prevention, has been implicated in lymphomagenesis, and is associated both with lymphoma stage and with response to treatment. However, spontaneous regression in lymphoma has been reported in 16% of patients in one series, of whom none were on herbal medications or COX-2 inhibitors. The key issue in both these patients is whether disease regression was \"spontaneous\" or causally related to therapy with Devil's Claw. The timing of the response suggests a positive effect. Further investigation is warranted, preferably with a COX-2 inhibitor of known purity."

Its major active components, harpagoside (1), harpagide (2), 8-coumaroylharpagide (3), and verbascoside (4), are believed to interact either synergistically or antagonistically in modulating the enzymes responsible for inducing inflammation, although this has not been probed hitherto. In the current work, the ability of these compounds to inhibit the expression of COX-2 following administration to freshly excised porcine skin has been investigated. An ethanol-soluble extract of H. procumbens tubers and two of the pure compounds tested showed promising activity in Western blotting and immunocytochemical assays, with harpagoside (1) and 8-coumaroylharpagide (3) exhibiting greater reductions in COX-2 expression than verbascoside (4). Harpagide (2) caused a significant increase in the levels of COX-2 expression after 6 h of topical application. The data suggest that the efficacy of H. procumbens is dependent upon the ratios of compounds 1-4 present, which is inconsistent with some current official monograph specifications based solely on harpagoside (1) content.",

It is considered that the instance of AORC will continue to increase. To assess the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of Harpagophytum (Bioforce) in the treatment of AORC, a single group open study of 8 weeks duration (259 patients) was performed in the United Kingdom. Effectiveness was assessed by numeric rating scales, the Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) Index and the Algofunctional Hand Osteoarthritis Index. Tolerance was measured by a numeric rating scale and safety by self-reporting, blood analysis and liver function tests. Quality of life was measured by SF-12 questionnaire. There were statistically significant (p < 0.0001) improvements in patient assessment of global pain, stiffness and function. There were also statistically significant reductions in mean pain scores for hand, wrist, elbow, shoulder, hip, knee and back pain. Quality of life measurements (SF-12) were significantly increased from baseline and 60% patients either reduced or stopped concomitant pain medication. Harpagophytum is an effective and well-tolerated serious treatment option for mild to moderate degenerative rheumatic disorders providing improved quality of life measure.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a highly prevalent musculoskeletal disorder. Conventional treatment (i.e., the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-NSAIDs) is associated with well-documented adverse effects. Devil's Claw (Harpagophytum procumbens) a traditional South African herbal remedy used for rheumatic conditions, may be a safer treatment option. To date, 14 clinical trials have assessed its efficacy/ effectiveness in OA. AIM: To address the two main questions of importance to clinicians: (1) Does Devil's Claw work for the treatment of OA, and (2) Is it safe? METHODS: A review of the literature on Devil's Claw and OA from 1966 to 2006 was performed using multiple search databases, monographs, and citation tracking. Relevant trials in all languages were identified and included. Both internal validity (i.e., adequacy of the dosage and period of treatment for this condition, reporting of randomization, rates of dropout, blinding, and statistical analysis) and external validity (i.e., inclusion/ exclusion criteria, baseline characteristics of the study populations, trial setting, and the appropriateness of the outcome measures of the trials) were assessed. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were identified: eight observational studies; 2 comparator trials (1 open, the other randomized to assess clinical effectiveness); and 4 double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trials to assess efficacy. Many of the published trials lacked certain important methodological quality criteria. However, the data from the higher quality studies suggest that Devil's Claw appeared effective in the reduction of the main clinical symptom of pain. The assessment of safety is limited by the small populations generally evaluated in the clinical studies. From the current data, Devil's Claw appears to be associated with minor risk (relative to NSAIDs), but further long-term assessment is required. CONCLUSIONS: The methodological quality of the existing clinical trials is generally poor, and although they provide some support, there are a considerable number of methodologic caveats that make further clinical investigations warranted. The clinical evidence to date cannot provide a definitive answer to the two questions posed: (1) Does it work? And (2) is it safe? A definitive high-quality trial that addresses the necessary methodologic improvements noted is needed to answer these important clinical questions.",

      "abstract": "Devil's claw is the common name for two species in the genus Harpagophytum. Their root extracts contain the iridoid glycoside, harpagoside, which has been found to be effective in the treatment of degenerative rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, tendonitis, kidney inflammation, and heart disease. Most of the world's supply comes from Namibia, with lesser amounts from South Africa and Botswana. In 2002, the peak year of export, 1018 tonnes of dried tubers were exported from southern Africa, representing the harvest of millions of plants. In 2001, sales in Germany were estimated at 30 M euros, accounting for 74% of the prescriptions for rheumatism. Harvest has improved income levels in marginalized communities but it has also raised questions of sustainability. In 2000, recommendations were made to the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) to add devil's claw to Appendix II. In 2004, the proposal was formally withdrawn due to the efforts of the range states to address sustainability issues. Replacing wild collection with cultivation has generated a debate on the positive and negative effects on harvester income and rural farmers. Successful cultivation efforts have involved micropropagation techniques and growing the plant without water or fertilizers. The governments of the main range states are working with local communities to develop policies and regulations to protect the species and to determine a sustainable harvest.",

Only preparations with proven effectiveness for painful lower back or arthrotic pain are an attractive alternative to synthetic analgesics, and are of substantial benefit in the treatment of chronic pain. From an evidence based view, extract with at least 50 mg harpagoside in the daily dose should be recommended for the treatment of pain. Treatment with devil's claw extract is associated with a lower risk of adverse events than treatment with synthetic analgesics, and may contribute in the majority of patients to the relief of pain.",

In order to add data on the efficacy and long-term safety of an aqueous extract (Doloteffin; 2400 mg extract daily, corresponding to 50 mg harpagoside), which has been tested successfully in patients with low back pain, an uncontrolled multicentre drug surveillance study for about 12 weeks was conducted in 75 patients with arthrosis of the hip or knee. To standardize the assessment of treatment effects, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) osteoarthritis index (10 point scale) as well as the 10 cm VAS pain scale were used. The results of the study revealed a strong reduction of pain and the symptoms of osteoarthritis. There was a relevant improvement of each WOMAC subscale as well as of the total WOMAC index: 23.8% for the pain subscale, 22.2% for the stiffness subscale and 23.1% for the physical function subscale. The WOMAC total score was reduced by 22.9%. VAS pain scores were decreased by 25.8% for actual pain, 25.2% for average pain, 22.6% for worst pain and 24.5% for the total pain score. The physicians reported a continuous improvement in typical clinical findings such as 45.5% for pain on palpation, 35% for limitation of mobility and 25.4% for joint crepitus. Only two cases of possible adverse drug reactions were reported (dyspeptic complaints and a sensation of fullness). Although this was an open clinical study, the results suggest that this Devil's claw extract has a clinically beneficial effect in the treatment of arthrosis of the hip or knee.",

      "abstract": "PROBLEM: This randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study was intended to investigate the effects of Harpagophytum procumbens (Devil's Claw) on sensory, motor and vascular mechanisms of muscle pain. In addition to clinical efficacy and tolerability, possible action mechanisms were analysed by means of experimental algesimetric methods. METHODOLOGY: The study was performed on patients with slight to moderate muscular tension or slight muscular pain of the back, shoulder and neck. On a double-blind randomised basis the verum group received 2x1 film tablets per day, i. e. 2x480 mg/day, of Harpagophytum extract LI 174 (Rivoltan(R)) at 8.00 a.m. and 8.00 p.m. over a certain period. The duration of the therapy was 4 weeks. Data recording at 14-day intervals was made using a visual analogue scale, pressure algometer test, recording of antinociceptive muscular reflexes, muscle stiffness test, EMG surface activity, muscular ischaemia test, clinical global score and subjective patient and physician ratings. RESULTS: A total of 31 patients in the verum group and 32 in the placebo group were treated. After four weeks of treatment there was found to be a clear clinical efficacy of the verum on the clinical global score and in the patient and physician ratings. Highly significant effects were found in the visual analogue scale, the pressure algometer test, the muscle stiffness test and the muscular ischaemia test. No difference from placebo was found in the recording of antinociceptive muscular reflexes or in the EMG surface activity. Tolerability was good; no serious adverse effects occurred. CONCLUSIONS: A highly significant clinical efficacy was achieved with a monotherapy of Harpagophytum dry extract LI 174 after four weeks' treatment at a dosage of 2x480 mg/day in cases of slight to moderate muscular pain. With regard to the action mechanisms investigated, it may be concluded that treatment with Harpagophytum extract LI 174 may be expected to have a significant influence on sensory and vascular muscular response and bring about a reduction in muscle stiffness. No central nervous effects were discovered.",
