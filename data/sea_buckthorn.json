      "abstract": "Enriched or fortified foods are typically linked to ultra-processed foods, limiting the choice of functional food in the market. Addressing the market potential, particularly the elder population with osteoporosis, the functional food industry should consider developing a healthy snack enriched with bioactive substances. This study aimed to produce freeze-dried Polish Gala apple with improved antioxidant properties and calcium content via impregnation or osmotic dehydration process. The solutions containing various concentrations of sea buckthorn (SB) juice and inulin were prepared at different temperatures and times, then analyzed by response surface regression modelling. Subsequently, the effect of the addition of 0-6% calcium lactate (CaL) on antioxidant properties and calcium content was also studied. Freeze-dried apple, after impregnation with 93.8% SB juice, 0:100 inulin-SB juice ratio, at 30 °C for 120 min, with the addition of 4% CaL (hereafter called \"4% CaL\" treatment), possessed a minimum yet acceptable loss of antioxidant properties and increased calcium content (2209.13 mg Ca/100 g). UPLC-PDA revealed the altered compositions of phenolics (flavonols were dominated by isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside and isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside) and carotenoids in 4% CaL. The 4% CaL also exhibited lower polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase activities, moderate sensory acceptability with soft texture, and better nutritional values with lower calories when compared to the controls. This work is a scalable study, covering aspects of process design, physicochemical, nutritional, and enzymatic properties, as well as sensory profiling, which has potential for industrial implementation.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), a critical complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is marked by metabolic dysfunction, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation, ultimately progressing to heart failure. This study investigated the synergistic therapeutic potential of Hippophae rhamnoides L. (sea buckthorn, SBU) extract and metformin in a mouse model of T2DM-induced DCM. T2DM was induced using a 45% high-fat-AGEs-enriched diet, followed by treatment with SBU, metformin, or their combination. Treatment effects were monitored through bioinformatic analysis, chemoinformatic prediction, behavioral testing, biochemical assays, histopathological evaluations and gene expression profiles. Based on bioinformatic analysis, we identified key hub genes involved in the diabetic cardiomyopathy including SERPINE1, NRG1, MYH11, PTH, NR4A2, NRF2, PGC1α, GPX4, ATF1, ASCL2, NOX1, NLRP3, CCK8, COX2, CCL2, PTGS2, EGFR, and oncostatin, which are pivotal in modulating the ferroptosis pathway. Furthermore, the expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) NEAT1 and MALAT1, critical regulators of inflammation and cell death, was effectively downregulated, correlating with decreased levels of the pro-inflammatory marker oncostatin. The combined therapy significantly improved glucose regulation, reduced systemic inflammation and protected the heart from oxidative damage. Histopathological analysis revealed notable reductions in cardiac necrosis and fibrosis. Particularly, the combination therapy of SBU and metformin demonstrated a synergistic effect, surpassing the benefits of individual treatments in preventing cardiac damage. These findings highlight the potential of integrating SBU with metformin as a novel therapeutic strategy for managing DCM by targeting both metabolic and ferroptosis-related pathways. This dual intervention opens promising avenues for future clinical applications in diabetic heart disease management, offering a comprehensive approach to mitigating the progression of DCM."

The SBP extraction parameters were optimized, the following optimal parameters were identified: solid-liquid ratio of 1:32 g/mL, ultrasound duration of 26 min, ultrasound temperature of 52 °C, and composite enzyme concentration of 6000 U/100 mL, and the maximum extraction yield of SBP was 24.07 ± 0.15 %. The separation and purification of SBP resulted in the isolation of three fractions of polysaccharides (SBPR-1, SBPR-2, SBPR-3). The composition and structural characteristics of the SBPRs were identified. Furthermore, the SBPRs exhibited the characteristic absorption peaks of polysaccharides. Notably, the surface microstructures of the SBPRs showed significant variations. Moreover, all SBPRs demonstrated commendable thermal stability and in vitro antioxidant activity. This study serves as a reference for the development and application of natural antioxidants and provides a theoretical foundation for the environmentally friendly and effective extraction of SBP."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cultivating edible fungi, particularly Lentinula edodes, efficiently transforms agroforestry byproducts into valuable products. However, the mechanism of the promotive effects of those substrates was largely unknown. This study used wolfberry (WB) and sea buckthorn (SBK) substrates to investigate mushroom fruiting bodies' physiological, proteomics, and metabolism profiling. RESULTS: Results show that compared to apple wood (AW), the crude protein and fatty acids were substantially enhanced by both WB and SBK treatment. We identified 1409 and 1190 upregulated and downregulated differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) for the SBK versus AW group and observed 929 overlapped DAPs with upregulation patterns. Of these DAPs, carbohydrates and oxidoreductase activity pathways were significantly enriched. Moreover, the enhanced expression of nine genes by WB and SBK was confirmed by qPCR. Metabolism suggests that 66 differentially abundant metabolites overlapped in the list of two comparison groups (WB versus AW and SBK versus AW). CONCLUSION: Collectively, we summarized that both WB and SBK stimulate glucose degradation, enhance the expression of gene-related oxidoreductase activity, and promote protein biosynthesis by coordinating with amino acid metabolism. This study highlights the importance of oxidoreductase activity in promoting nutritional value in mushroom fruiting bodies induced by WB and SBK substrates."

      "abstract": "Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) has many beneficial health properties. In our previous study we showed suppression of hyperglycaemia, water intake, decreased sorbitol levels in the lens of the eyes after sea buckthorn m(Hippophae rhamnoides L.) treatment in Zucker diabetic fatty rats (animal model of type 2 diabetes mellitus, T2DM) with better antioxidant properties of dried berries. Afterwards, we decided to compare the effects of metformin (150 mg/kg b.wt.) and sea buckthorn dried berries (500 or 1000 mg/kg b.wt.) or leaves infusion per os administration on the liver histology in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Moreover, following biochemical parameters in the blood serum were determined: alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin, cholesterol and triglycerides. The histological analyses revealed the appearance of lipid droplets within the liver tissue of diabetic ZDF rats which were not observed in the non-diabetic control animals. Administration of both metformin and sea buckthorn caused a decrease in the number of lipid droplets in the liver. In ZDF rats, an increase in AST, ALP, bilirubin, cholesterol and triglyceride in blood serum was noticed. In comparison with diabetic animals, metformin and sea buckthorn administration did not change the biochemical parameters but only a tendency to reduce some biochemical parameters was noticed. The obtained results suggest that sea buckthorn dried fruits as well as leaves infusion may have biological potential to be used in prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases. Next studies are needed to analyse the exact mechanism of action, develop and promote sea buckthorn berries as a functional food or natural therapeutical products.",

Different ultrasound powers (250, 350, 450, 550, 650 W) and times (20, 25, 30, 35, 40 min) were applied to assess these effects. Among these treatments, the ultrasonic treatment of 350 W for 30 min led to an increase in surface hydrophobicity, a significant reduction in average particle size, and enhanced the solubility, emulsifying capacity, and foaming properties of SBSP. Furthermore, the secondary and tertiary structures of SBSP underwent changes during the ultrasound treatment, with a decrease in α-helix content and a 17.5% increase in β-sheet content. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed a reduction in SBSP crystallinity. The in vitro digestibility of the protein was also improved, while the content of undesirable volatile flavor compounds was reduced during extraction. Thus, ultrasound-assisted pretreatment proves to be an effective method for extracting SBSP, improving its functional properties, and providing important implications for the application of SBSP in food products.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota is firmly associated with the progression of ulcerative colitis (UC). Beneficial microbial metabolites, such as butyrate, exert vital roles in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. The Sea buckthorn berry is a traditional Chinese medicine homologous to food and medicine which is widely applied in the prevention and treatment of UC in clinic practice. Recent studies have exhibited the potential function of Sea buckthorn on regulating the gut microbiota, however, the mechanism underlying its anti-colitis effects and the key gut microbes mediating its efficacy are still unclear. PURPOSE: This study is intended to explore the pharmacological mechanism of the efficacy of Sea buckthorn berries extract (SBE) in alleviating UC from the perspective of the gut microbial regulation. METHODS: The effect of SBE on UC was evaluated on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine model by assessing the body weight change, colon length, disease activity index (DAI), histopathological staining and the transcriptional expression of genes associated with inflammation and mucosal integrity. The dependence of the gut microbiota in the therapeutical effects of SBE on UC was confirmed by pseudo-germ-free mice and the co-housing experiment. The differential gut microbes altered by SBE were discovered by 16S rRNA sequencing and qPCR. The levels of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in bacterial medium and colonic contents were determined by GC-MS/MS. Bacterial colonization was conducted to estimate the effects of the bacteria on UC and to verify the involvement of the functional bacteria in the efficacy of SBE. A butyrate receptor G protein-coupled receptor (GPR)109A antagonist mepenzolate bromide (MPN) was used to validate the important role of butyrate and GPR109A in the anti-colitis effects of SBE and functional bacteria on UC. Two-way ANOVA was employed for multiple curve comparison and One-way ANOVA and Brown-Forsythe ANOVA test were used for multiple group comparison. Statistical significance was defined as p< 0.05. RESULTS: SBE treatment significantly alleviated DSS-induced UC and its therapeutical effects was impaired in pseudo-germ-free mice. Moreover, the co-housing experiment exhibited that SBE-altered microbiota could effectively ameliorate UC. Further research demonstrated that Faecalibaculum rodentium was obviously increased by SBE and could be transferable by co-housing. Moreover, butyrate, a product of F. rodentium, dramatically decreased in UC mice while could be recovered by SBE administration. Abolishment of F. rodentium using vancomycin deprived the efficacy of SBE, but this could be reversed by recolonization of F. rodentium. Finally, blockage of the butyrate's receptor GPR109A weakened the effects of F. rodentium, indicating the indispensability of butyrate and GPR109A in the anti-colitis effects of F. rodentium. CONCLUSION: SBE has potent therapeutical efficacy on UC including relieving inflammation and enhancing intestinal epithelial integrity, which is mediated by the gut F. rodentium-regulated butyrate-GPR109A axis.",

The sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) berry extract is rich in essential fatty acids and antioxidants, including vitamin C, vitamin E, and anthocyanins, which contribute to its wide-ranging health benefits. In this study, we assessed the morphology, intracellular delivery, and anti-inflammatory effect of sodium cholate (NaC) and sodium deoxycholate (NaDC)-based phytocarriers loaded with ethanolic extract from sea buckthorn berries (sea buckthorn carrier nanostructures, further defined as phytocarriers). Methods: Negative and electron cryo-microscopy were used to analyze hollow and loaded nanocarriers. The cyto-compatibility of nanocarriers was assessed by endpoint (LDH and MTS) and real-time cell assays, on both human fibroblasts (HS27) and human normal monocytes (SC). The anti-inflammatory effect of hollow and loaded nanocarriers was tested by multiplexing. Results: The negative and electron cryo-microscopy analyses showed that NaC-based phytocarriers were spherical, whilst NaDC-based phytocarriers were predominantly polymorphic. Moreover, the NaDC-based phytocarriers frequently formed large lipid networks or \"plaques\". Although 24 h cytotoxicity testing showed both types of nanocarriers are biocompatible with human fibroblasts and monocytes, based on a long-term real-time assay, NaDC delayed fibroblast proliferation. NaC sea buckthorn phytocarriers did not impair fibroblast proliferation in the long term and they were uptaken by cells, as shown by hyperspectral microscopy. NaC nanocarriers and NaC sea buckthorn phytocarriers induced an anti-inflammatory effect, lowering IL-8 cytokine production in normal human monocytes as soon as 4 h of treatment lapsed. Conclusions: NaC-derived phytocarriers loaded with sea buckthorn alcoholic extract are a cell-compatible delivery system with anti-inflammatory properties."

Ultrasonic treatment ensured effective homogenization of SBO in both types of emulsions, resulting in yellow-tinted semi-opaque films with relatively low micro-roughness. Generally, GEL films demonstrated lower UV barrier properties and solubility but exhibited higher compactness, crystallinity, transparency, surface hydrophobicity, oxygen barrier performance, strength, and antiradical activity compared to their NaCAS-based counterparts. In a concentration-dependent manner, SBO decreased the solubility and water absorption of the gelatin-based film and enhanced its oxygen permeability. Conversely, SBO improved the water vapor barrier properties of both films in a concentration-independent manner. At the highest SBO concentration, the tensile strength of NaCAS- and GEL-based films decreased by 27% and 20%, respectively, while their antiradical activity increased by 9.3× and 4.3× (based on the time required for the half-neutralization of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radicals). Migration studies showed that at the lowest concentration, SBO was released (into 95% ethanol) approximately 2× faster from the GEL-based film than from the NaCAS film, whereas at higher concentrations, the trend reversed."

Optimal malic acid degradation and antioxidant occurred when Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. pombe) was inoculated after pectinase digestion of the pulp, while sequential inoculation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. pombe produced the most favorable flavor profile. S. pombe effectively promoted the degradation of malic and quinic acids during fermentation, improving color, antioxidant activity, and flavor characteristics. These findings highlight the critical role of pectinase digestion and inoculation sequence, offering practical guidance for optimizing large-scale fermentation processes and strain selection to develop innovative sea buckthorn beverages and enhance their market potential.",

      "abstract": "SP0.1-1, derived from Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.), has been discovered to exhibit unique antioxidant activity. In this study, we investigated the immunomodulatory activity and mechanisms of SP0.1-1 on macrophage RAW 264.7 cells in vitro and immunosuppressive mice induced by cyclophosphamide in vivo. The results indicated SP0.1-1 strengthened the immune functions via promoting the proliferation of RAW264.7 cells and phagocytic activity, along with stimulating the release of NO, ROS and cytokines including TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and IFN-γ. Western blot and molecular docking analysis demonstrated that SP0.1-1 attached to the prime receptors TLR2 and TLR4 in RAW264.7 cells, and triggered the activation of MyD88-mediated MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways, thereby exerting the immune response in RAW264.7 cells. However, the intervention of specific inhibitors against TLR2, TLR4, JNK, ERK, p38 and NF-κB blocked the TLR-mediated MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways and downregulated the levels of NO and the aforementioned cytokines, thus suppressing the activation of macrophages. Therefore, it can be speculated that SP0.1-1 activated the macrophages principally via the TLR2/4-MyD88-mediated MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. Additionally, SP0.1-1 could protect against the cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression in mice, manifested by the improvement of body weight, immune organ indices, phagocytic index, and the relievement of spleen damage, along with the enhancement of cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-γ and immunoglobulin IgG and IgM. These findings will shed light on the molecular mechanism of SP0.1-1 on the immunoregulatory effect, and lay the foundation for exploiting a potential immunostimulatory agent of SP0.1-1.",

Tropomyosin (TM) induced a regulatory immune response associated with food allergy. In this study, a mouse model of food allergy sensitized to tropomyosin (TM) was established to assess the antiallergic properties of sea buckthorn flavonoid extract (SBF). SBF alleviated mice's allergic symptoms and exhibited a significant reduction in the levels of IgE and histamine. Meanwhile, SBF repaired the allergic Th2 cell overpolarization generated by TM, via downregulating the IL-4 production and upregulating IFN-γ production to restore the balance of Th1/Th2 cells. Furthermore, the 16S RNA analysis showed that SBF primarily restored the gut microbiota via increasing the abundance in Chitinophilidae and decreasing in Burkholderiaceae, Pneumatobacteriaceae, and Sphingomonadaceae. Gut metabolomes determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) suggested that TM upregulated PE (14:0/22:1(13Z)) and SBF decreased formimino-l-glutamic acid and urocanic acid levels. According to the KEGG pathway analysis, SBF treatment has been shown to modulate glycerophospholipid and histidine metabolism to improve allergic reactions. SBF holds great promise as a novel potential agent for the treatment of food allergies.",

      "abstract": "In this work, we explored the role and mechanism of sea buckthorn oil in reducing radiation-induced skin damage. The radiation-induced rat skin injury model was established using strontium-90. Rats were treated with sea buckthorn oil twice a day postirradiation, and skin damage was observed at different times and evaluated using an injury score. Skin pathological changes were observed using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the expression of vascular growth and pathway proteins. ELISA was used to detect the secretion level of inflammatory factors. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect macrophage polarization marker proteins. We found that sea buckthorn oil can alleviate radiation-induced skin damage, accelerate skin vascular regeneration, and promote the up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor (VEGFR). These results demonstrate the beneficial effects of sea buckthorn oil on radiation-induced skin damage. Furthermore, the levels of IL-1β and TNF-α in the sea buckthorn oil treatment group were significantly lower than those in the control group, while the levels of IL-4 and IL10 were significantly higher (P < 0.05). CD206 expression also increased in the sea buckthorn oil treatment group, while CD16 expression decreased compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Western blotting showed that PI3K, Akt and ERK expression increased in the sea buckthorn oil treatment group (P < 0.05). The beneficial effect of sea buckthorn oil in reducing the inflammatory response in irradiated rats was diminished when they were treated with PI3K inhibitor. We conclude that sea buckthorn oil may regulate macrophage M2 polarization by increasing the PI3K-Akt-ERK signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting the inflammatory response and promoting skin vascular regeneration to prevent and treat radiation-induced skin damage.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides), a traditional Tibetan medicinal herb, exhibits protective effects against cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Although Sea buckthorn extract (SBE) has been confirmed to alleviate airway inflammation in mice, its therapeutic effect and underlying mechanism on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) requires further clarification. AIM OF THE STUDY: To elucidate the alleviative effect and molecular mechanism of SBE on lipopolysaccharides (LPS)/porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE)-induced COPD by blocking ferroptosis. METHODS: The anti-ferroptotic effects of SBE were evaluated in human BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells using CCK8, RT-qPCR, western blotting, and transmission electron microscopy. Transwell was employed to detect chemotaxis of neutrophils. COPD model was induced by intranasally administration of LPS/PPE in mice and measured by alterations of histopathology, inflammation, and ferroptosis. RNA-sequencing, western blotting, antioxidant examination, flow cytometry, DARTS, CETSA, and molecular docking were then used to investigate its anti-ferroptotic mechanisms. RESULTS: In vitro, SBE not only suppressed erastin- or RSL3-induced ferroptosis by suppressing lipid peroxides (LPOs) production and glutathione (GSH) depletion, but also suppressed ferroptosis-induced chemotactic migration of neutrophils via reducing mRNA expression of chemokines. In vivo, SBE ameliorated LPS/PPE-induced COPD phenotypes, and inhibited the generation of LPOs, cytokines, and chemokines. RNA-sequencing showed that p53 pathway and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway were implicated in SBE-mediated anti-ferroptotic action. SBE repressed erastin- or LPS/PPE-induced overactivation of p53 and MAPK pathway, thereby decreasing expression of diamine acetyltransferase 1 (SAT1) and arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15), and increasing expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11). Mechanistically, erastin-induced elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was reduced by SBE through directly scavenging free radicals, thereby contributing to its inhibition of p53 and MAPK pathways. CETSA, DARTS, and molecular docking further showed that ROS-generating enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase 4 (NOX4) may be the target of SBE. Overexpression of NOX4 partially impaired the anti-ferroptotic activity of SBE. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that SBE mitigated COPD by suppressing p53 and MAPK pro-ferroptosis pathways via directly scavenging ROS and blocking NOX4. These findings also supported the clinical application of Sea buckthorn in COPD therapy.",

This study investigated the preventive effects and potential biological mechanisms of SYN (Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and sea buckthorn polysaccharides) on DSS-induced colitis in mice. The results indicated that dietary supplementation with SYN has a significant improvement effect on DSS mice. SYN ameliorated disease activity index (DAI), colon length, and intestinal barrier permeability in mice. In addition, RT-qPCR results indicated that after SYN intervention, the expression levels of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-17F) and transcription factor RORγt secreted by Th17 cells were significantly reduced, and the expression levels of anti-inflammatory factors (IL-10 and TGF-β) and transcription factor Foxp3 secreted by Treg cells were robustly increased. 16S rDNA sequencing analysis revealed that key intestinal microbiota related to Th17/Treg balance (Ligilactobacillus, Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, and Akkermansia) was significantly enriched. At the same time, a significant increase in microbial metabolites SCFAs and BAs was observed. We speculate that SYN may regulate the Th17/Treg balance by restructuring the structure and composition of the intestinal microbiota, thereby mitigating DSS-induced colitis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hyperlipidemia (HLP) presents a significant challenge to global public health. Mounting evidence suggests that statins, the recommended first-line lipid-lowering agents, have significant adverse effects. Consequently, the quest for natural and efficacious alternative therapies is steadily emerging as a research priority for HLP prevention and treatment. Consumption of tea, which is rich in diverse biologically active compounds with the capacity to regulate lipid metabolism and combat obesity, has emerged as a promising alternative therapy. Sea buckthorn leaves are rich in a multitude of biologically active substances, have a hypolipidemic effect, and can be used as a raw material for tea because of their unique flavor. There is a suggestion that combining Aspergillus cristatus with tea could modify or boost the lipid-lowering active compounds present in tea, thereby increasing its efficacy in regulating lipid metabolism. RESULTS: Sea Buckthorn Leaf Fu Tea (SBLFT) was obtained by fermentation when sea buckthorn leaves contained 42 % moisture, inoculated with Aspergillus cristatus 0.2 mL/g, and incubated for 8 d at constant temperature. Animal experiments demonstrated that SBLFT significantly inhibited body weight gain in HLP rats and reduced lipid content and serum oxidative stress. In addition, liver tissue sections and functional indices showed that SBLFT can improve liver morphology and function abnormalities. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results indicated that the expression of Liver kinase B1 (LKB1), adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), and sterol-regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP1c) gene related to lipid metabolism was altered. CONCLUSION: SBLFT improved HLP, specifically via promoting the expression of LKB1 in the liver of HLP rats, activating AMPK, and inhibiting ACC1 and SREBP1c expression, resulting in the inhibition of fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis-related enzymes at the transcriptional level."

Traditional sea buckthorn thermal processing (TP) technology has problems such as low juice yield, poor quality, and poor flavor. Sea buckthorn berries are processed using a technique combining pulsed electric field (PEF) and high-pressure processing (HPP) to increase juice yield and study its impact on the quality and volatile aroma of sea buckthorn juice. Results have show that, compared with TP, under the condition of PEF-HPP, the juice yield of sea buckthorn significantly increased by 11.37% (p > 0.05); TP and PEF-HPP treatments could effectively kill microorganisms in sea buckthorn juice, but the quality of sea buckthorn juice decreased significantly after TP treatment (p > 0.05), whereas PEF-HPP coupling technology could maximally retain the nutrients of sea buckthorn juice while inhibiting enzymatic browning to improve color, viscosity, and particle size. The flavor of sea buckthorn juice is analyzed using electronic nose (E-nose) and gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometer (GC-IMS) techniques, and it has been shown that PEF-HPP retains more characteristic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of sea buckthorn while avoiding the acrid and pungent flavors produced by TP, such as benzaldehyde, (E)-2-heptenal, and pentanoic acid, among others, which improves the sensory quality of sea buckthorn juice. PEF-HPP technology is environmentally friendly and efficient, with significant economic benefits.

A specialized software was used for the determination of potential optimal extraction parameters, leading to the development of four optimized extracts with different characteristics (UAE ± EAE). For these extracts, buffered or non-buffered solutions have been used, with the aim to determine the influence of adjustable pH on extractability. As enzymatic solution, a pectinase, cellulase, and hemicellulase mix (2:1:1) has been applied, acting as pre-treatment for the optimized protocol. The highest extractive yields have been identified for non-buffered extracts, and the E-UAE combination obtained extracts with the highest overall in vitro antioxidant activity. The HPLC-MSn analysis demonstrated a rich composition in different types of isorhamnetin-O-glycosides, as well as some quercetin-O-glycosides, showing a high recovery of specific flavonol-type polyphenolic species. Moreover, we have tentatively identified two flavanols (i.e., catechin and epigallocatechin) and one flavone derivative (i.e., luteolin).",

Furthermore, mitochondrial dynamics have been implicated to play a critical role in these processes. For the first time, we describe in this study how UVB-induced aberrant mitochondrial dynamics and inflammation interact in primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). Our findings demonstrated that UV-B irradiation induced -impairment in mitochondrial dynamics by increasing mitochondrial fragmentation in HDFs. Imbalanced mitochondrial dynamics lead to the activation of NFкB and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The current study further aimed to investigate the protective effect of Naringenin (a naturally occurring flavonoid isolated from Sea buckthorn fruit pulp) against UV-B-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and inflammation in HDFs and Balb/c mice. Although Naringenin has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potential, its effects and mechanisms of action on UVB-induced inflammation remained unclear. We observed that Naringenin restored the UV-B-induced imbalance in mitochondrial fission and fusion in HDFs. It also inhibited the phosphorylation of NFкB and reduced the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Naringenin also alleviated UV-B-induced oxidative stress by scavenging the reactive oxygen species and up-regulating the cellular antioxidant enzymes (Catalase and Nrf2). Topical application of Naringenin to the dorsal skin of Balb/c mice exposed to UV-B radiation prevented mitochondrial fragmentation and progression of inflammatory responses. Naringenin treatment prevented neutrophil infiltration and epidermal thickening in mice's skin. These findings provide an understanding for further research into impaired mitochondrial dynamics as a therapeutic target for UV-B-induced inflammation. Our findings imply that Naringenin could be developed as a therapeutic remedy against UVB-induced inflammation.",

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are a broadly understood concept focusing on vascular and heart dysfunction. Lack of physical exercise, type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, thromboembolism, and kidney and lung diseases all contribute to the development of heart and blood vessel dysfunction. Although effective and important, traditional treatment with diuretics, statins, beta blockers, calcium inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, and anti-platelet drugs remains a second-line treatment after dietary interventions and lifestyle changes. Scientists worldwide are still looking for an herbal product that would be effective and free from side effects, either taken together with or before the standard pharmacological intervention. Such herbal-originated medication therapy may include Morus alba L. (white mulberry), Elaeagnus rhamnoides (L.) A. Nelson (sea-buckthorn), Allium sativum L. (garlic), Convallaria majalis L. (lily of the valley), Leonurus cardiaca L. (motherwort), and Crataegus spp. (hawthorn). Valuable herbal raw materials include leaves, fruits, seeds, and even thorns. This short review focuses on six herbs that can constitute an interesting and potential therapeutic option in the management of cardiovascular disorders.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sea buckthorn has the functions of antioxidation, antitumor, anti-inflammation and regulating energy metabolism. In order to investigate the effects of sea buckthorn powder and sea buckthorn flavonoids on the antioxidant properties, immune function and muscle fatty acid composition of common carp, an oral feeding experiment was carried out. RESULTS: The administration of glucose significantly reduced the levels of glutathione and the activity of total antioxidant capacity enzyme in serum and hepatopancreas, while concurrently upregulating the level of malondialdehyde (MDA)(P < 0.05). Conversely, oral intake of sea buckthorn powder and flavonoids increased antioxidant enzyme activity and decreased MDA levels. In terms of antioxidant molecular indicators, sea buckthorn powder and sea buckthorn flavonoids significantly increased the mRNA levels of nuclear factor NF-E2-related factor (nrf2) in the hepatopancreas and muscle. Meanwhile, mRNA expression levels of downstream antioxidant-related genes (gr, cat, gpx, and sod) regulated by Nrf2 were also upregulated. In the immune aspects, the mRNA expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (il-6), interleukin-1β (il-1β) and nuclear factor-κB (nf-κb), were reduced but the expressions of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as growth factor-β (tgf-β) and interleukin-10 (il-10), were enhanced in the head kidney and spleen tissues after oral administration with sea buckthorn. In terms of muscle fatty acid composition, the ratio of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)/n-6 PUFA was notably higher after administering sea buckthorn flavonoids than that of the glucose group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that oral administration of sea buckthorn powder and sea buckthorn flavonoids significantly enhanced the antioxidant capacity and immune response and improved the muscle fatty acid compositions in common carp, and also mitigated the adverse effects of glucose treatment to a certain extent. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "Enzymatic hydrolysis using pectinase is critical for producing high-yield and quality sea buckthorn juice. This study determined the optimal temperature, time, and enzyme dosage combinations to guide manufacturers. A temperature of 60 °C, hydrolysis time of 3 h, and 0.3% enzyme dosage gave 64.1% juice yield-25% higher than without enzymes. Furthermore, monitoring physicochemical properties reveals enzyme impacts on composition. Higher dosages increase soluble solids up to 15% and soluble fiber content by 35% through cell wall breakdown. However, excessive amounts over 0.3% decrease yields. Pectin concentration also declines dose-dependently, falling by 91% at 0.4%, improving juice stability but needing modulation to retain viscosity. Electrochemical fingerprinting successfully differentiates process conditions, offering a rapid quality control tool. Its potential for commercial inline use during enzymatic treatment requires exploration. Overall, connecting optimized parameters to measured effects provides actionable insights for manufacturers to boost yields, determine enzyme impacts on nutrition/functionality, and introduce novel process analytical technology. Further investigations of health properties using these conditions could expand sea buckthorn juice functionality.",

      "abstract": "Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) is a flowering shrub, and its berries have been utilized for decades as a raw ingredient in cuisines and herbal remedies. This evidence-based study focuses on its key bioactive constituents, and mechanism of protective effects with a focus on female reproductive processes. Parts of the plant contain phenols, carotenoids (lycopene, carotene, lutein, and zeaxanthin), flavonoids (isorhamnetin, quercetin, glycosides, and kaempferol), tocopherols, sterols, polyunsaturated fatty acids, minerals, vitamins, omega 3, 6, 9 and rare omega 7 fatty acids etc. Key polyphenolic flavonoids such as isorhamnetin and quercetin are believed to be mainly responsible behind its health benefits (against cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, obesity etc.) through properties including anti-cancer, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. These sea buckthorn constituents appear to mediate healthy ovarian cell proliferation, death, and hormone release, as well as decrease ovarian cancer possibly through apoptosis, and hormonal (estrogen) release. Thus, sea buckthorn and its bioactive ingredients may have potential in the management of gynecological problems such as uterine inflammation, endometriosis, and easing symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women (by targeting inflammatory cytokines and vascular endothelial growth factor - VEGF). Apigenin, myricetin, and luteolin have also been recommended as prospective ovarian cancer preventative and adjuvant therapy options as they can inhibit ovarian cancerogenesis by triggering apoptosis and halting the cell cycle in ovarian tumors. Furthermore, its oil (containing carotenoid, sterol, and hypericin) has been speculated as an alternative to estrogen replacement therapy for postmenopausal women particularly to improve vaginal epithelial integrity. However, it is uncertain whether steroid hormone receptors, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and inflammatory regulators are actually behind sea buckhorn's actions. Sea buckthorn, and its compounds' health promoting potential warrants further validation not just in vitro and in animal research, but also in clinical trials to identify and/or standardize optimal methods of delivery of biologically active molecules.",

      "abstract": "This experiment aimed to investigate the protective effect of sea buckthorn (Hipphophae rhamnoides) extract on an animal model of NAFLD induced by high-fat and cholesterol diet. Twenty-five SPF-grade male KM mice were randomly divided into the blank control group, high-fat model group, sea-buckthorn low-dose group, sea-buckthorn medium-dose group, and sea-buckthorn high-dose group. During the whole experiment, the high-fat model group and sea-buckthorn treatment group were fed high-fat and high-cholesterol diet to build the fatty liver model, whereas the blank control group was fed ordinary diet. The high-fat model group and blank control group were intragastrically given normal saline, and each sea buckthorn treatment group was intragastrically given different concentrations of sea buckthorn extract. After 5 weeks of intervention using the abovementioned method, the experiment was completed; relevant serological indexes were determined, and the liver coefficient was calculated. Our results demonstrated that the liver coefficient in the high-dose sea buckthorn group was extremely significantly decreased (P < 0.01) compared with that in the high-fat model group. In addition, the concentration of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in serum of mice was decreased by the intervention of sea buckthorn extract, whereas the concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was increased. Significant differences were observed between the sea-buckthorn high-dose treatment group and the high-fat model group (P < 0.05). The extracts of sea buckthorn had a certain protective effect on non-alcoholic fatty liver. This study lays an important foundation in developing and using sea buckthorn extract as a clinical drug and guiding people to take health care products reasonably.",

      "abstract": "Sea buckthorn pomace is a by-product of juice production, which is still rich in bioactive compounds. After drying, the pomace can be effectively used as a valuable addition to bakery products supporting their nutritional value. However, due to the high content of the amino acid asparagine in sea buckthorn, this promising material contributes to the undesirable formation of acrylamide. To reduce the risk from this potentially carcinogenic compound, enzymatic treatment of sea buckthorn with asparaginase was applied, which resulted in a substantial reduction of asparagine content from 1834 mg/kg in untreated dried sea buckthorn pomace to 89 mg/kg in enzymatically treated dried sea buckthorn pomace. 10% substitution of wholegrain cereal flour with enzymatically treated sea buckthorn pomace powder in rye and triticale biscuits resulted in a 35% reduction in acrylamide content, in the case of wholegrain wheat biscuits up to a 64% reduction, compared to biscuits with untreated sea buckthorn pomace powder. This study confirmed that treating fruit with asparaginase is an effective way to reduce health risk caused by acrylamide in biscuits enriched with nutritionally valuable fruit pomace."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sea buckthorn contains almost 200 nutrients and bioactive substances, including phenolic compounds such as flavonoids, vitamins, proteins, amino acids, minerals, alkaloids, chlorophyll derivatives, amines, organic acids, fatty acids and phytosterols. Human and animal studies suggest that sea buckthorn may have a variety of beneficial effects: cardioprotective, antiatherogenic, antioxidant, anticancer, immunomodulatory, antibacterial, antiviral and antiinflammatory. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of regular consumption of 100% sea buckthorn juice on the risk factors of cardiovascular diseases in women of productive age with hypercholesterolemia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A clinical study involved 19 women with a mean age of 54.06 ±2.97 years who consumed 50 mL of sea buckthorn juice daily for 8 weeks. Anthropometric and biochemical parameters in blood serum were monitored before the start of sea buckthorn consumption and after 8 weeks of consumption. Body composition was determined using an multifrequency analyzer InBody720. Routine biochemical analyzes were performed by standard methods in an accredited laboratory of the University Hospital by automatic biochemical analyzer BioMajesty JCA-BM6010/C. Statistical comparison between individual measurements was performed using a paired t-test, using Statistica Cz version 10 (TIBCO Software, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA). RESULTS: We observed significant decrease of body weight, body mass index (P<0.05), body fat and visceral fat (P<0.001) after 8 weeks of consumption of 100% sea buckthorn juice. In this intervention study, we observed a significant decrease in low-density cholesterol (P˂0.05) and a significant increase in high-density cholesterol (P˂0.001). The level of triglycerides was similar at the end of the study (P>0.05). After the intervention, we observed decrease of orosomucoid, immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin M (P<0.001) and C-reactive protein (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results support the hypothesis that the daily consumption of sea buckthorn juice for eight weeks could contribute to the beneficial effects of reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as the reduction of body and visceral fat, LDL-C, CRP and the increase of HDL-C.",

      "abstract": "In women, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.7% of total cases) and the leading cause of cancer death (6.9%) worldwide. Bioactive dietary components such as Sea buckthorn berries are known for their high carotenoid content, which has been shown to possess anti-cancer properties. Considering the limited number of studies investigating the bioactive properties of carotenoids in breast cancer, the aim of this study was to investigate the antiproliferative, antioxidant, and proapoptotic properties of saponified lipophilic Sea buckthorn berries extract (LSBE) in two breast cancer cell lines with different phenotypes: T47D (ER+, PR+, HER2-) and BT-549 (ER-, PR-, HER2-). The antiproliferative effects of LSBE were evaluated by an Alamar Blue assay, the extracellular antioxidant capacity was evaluated through DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP assays, the intracellular antioxidant capacity was evaluated through a DCFDA assay, and the apoptosis rate was assessed by flow cytometry. LSBE inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner, with a mean IC50 of 16 µM. LSBE has proven to be a good antioxidant both at the intracellular level, due to its ability to significantly decrease the ROS levels in both cell lines (p = 0.0279 for T47D, and p = 0.0188 for BT-549), and at the extracellular level, where the ABTS and DPPH inhibition vried between 3.38-56.8%, respectively 5.68-68.65%, and 35.6 mg/L equivalent ascorbic acid/g LSBE were recorded. Based on the results from the antioxidant assays, LSBE was found to have good antioxidant activity due to its rich carotenoid content. The flow cytometry results revealed that LSBE treatment induced significant alterations in late-stage apoptotic cells represented by 80.29% of T47D cells (p = 0.0119), and 40.6% of BT-549 cells (p = 0.0137). Considering the antiproliferative, antioxidant, and proapoptotic properties of the carotenoids from LSBE on breast cancer cells, further studies should investigate whether these bioactive dietary compounds could be used as nutraceuticals in breast cancer therapy.",

In experiments both in vitro and in vivo (ranging from cell lines to animal models and human patients), sea buckthorn has shown positive effects on symptoms of metabolic syndrome; evidence suggests that sea buckthorn treatment can decrease blood lipid content, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels, and regulate key metabolites. This article reviews the main bioactive compounds present in sea buckthorn and discusses their efficacy in treating metabolic syndrome. Specifically, we highlight bioactive compounds isolated from distinct sea buckthorn tissues; their effects on abdominal obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia; and their potential mechanisms of action in clinical applications. This review provides key insight into the benefits of sea buckthorn, promoting future research of this species and expansion of sea buckthorn-based therapies for metabolic syndrome."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The therapeutic properties of Hippophae rhamnoides L. were known in Ancient Greece and in Tibetan and Mongolian medicine, which commonly used it for the treatment of heart ailments, rheumatism, and brain disorders. Modern studies have indicated that Hippophae rhamnoides L. polysaccharide (HRP) can improve cognitive impairment in mice with Alzheimer's disease (AD) but the specific mechanisms of the protective effect of HRP have not been elucidated fully. RESULTS: Our results showed that Hippophae rhamnoides L. polysaccharide I (HRPI) improved pathological behaviors related to memory and cognition, and reduced 1 Beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptide deposition and neuronal cell necrosis. Pretreatment with Hippophae rhamnoides L. polysaccharide I (HRPI) also decreased the level of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), and reduced the release of inflammatory factors Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in the brains of mice with AD. Treatment with HRPI also suppressed the expression level of Recombinant Kelch Like ECH Associated Protein 1 (KEAP1), and increased the levels of Nuclear factor erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 (Nrf2), antioxidant enzymes Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in the brains of AD mice. CONCLUSIONS: On the whole, these findings revealed that HRPI could improve the learning and memory ability and attenuate pathologic impairment in AD mice, and the underlying mechanisms may involve mediating oxidative stress and inflammation, possibly through the regulation of the Keap1/Nrf2 and TLR4/MyD88 signaling pathways. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",

In order to find a suitable method for determining TPC and antioxidant activity, the effects of centrifugation and nylon membrane treatment on the determination of TPC and antioxidant activity in sea buckthorn juice were studied. TPC was determined by the Folin-Ciocalteau method, and antioxidant activity was determined by DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP assays. For Treatment Method (C): the sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 rpm and the supernatant was taken for analysis. Method (CF): The sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm, filtered by Nylon 66 filtration membranes with pore size of 0.22 μm, and taken for analysis. Method (F): the sample was filtered by Nylon 66 filtration membranes with pore size of 0.22 μm and taken for analysis. Method (N): after the sample of ultrasonic extract solution reacted completely with the assay system, the reaction solution was filtered by Nylon 66 filtration membranes with pore size of 0.22 μm and colorimetric determination was performed. The results showed that centrifugation or transmembrane treatment could affect the determination of TPC and antioxidant activity of sea buckthorn juice. There was no significant difference (p > 0.05) between methods (CF) and (F), while there was a significant difference (p < 0.05) between methods (C) (F) (N) or (C) (CF) (N). The TPC and antioxidant activity of sea buckthorn juice determined by the four treatment methods showed the same trend with fermentation time, and the TPC and antioxidant activity showed a significant positive correlation (p < 0.05). The highest TPC or antioxidant activity measured by method (N) indicates that method (N) has the least loss of TPC or antioxidant activity, and it is recommended for sample assays.",

A total of 240 23-week-old laying ducks (female ducks) with similar body weight were randomly divided into four treatment groups with 6 replicates of 10 each. The experimental groups were fed diets supplemented with 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 g/kg of SBE, respectively. The results showed that the addition of 1.0 g/kg SBE to the diet had significant increase (P < 0.05) in average egg weight and feed conversion ratio. The inclusion of SBE showed the significant improvement (P < 0.05) in yolk weight, shell strength, egg white height and haugh unit. Ducks fed with 1.0 and 1.5 g/kg SBE displayed a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in yolk cholesterol. The significant improvements were observed in the contents of total amino acid essential amino acids, non-essential amino acids, umami amino acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, and docosahexenoic acids of eggs (P < 0.05) when supplemented with SBE. However, the contents of total saturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in eggs showed decrease when ducks fed with SBE diets (P < 0.05). SBE diets may reduce (P < 0.05) the levels of serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, while increased (P < 0.05) the levels of serum superoxide dismutase, total antioxidant capacity, and glutathione catalase compared to the control. The levels of serum immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin M were improved in SBE diets (P < 0.05) in comparation to the control. The addition of SBE to diets can improve feed nutrient utilization, increase egg weight, optimaze egg quality and amino acid content in eggs, reduce blood lipids, improve fatty acid profile and yolk cholesterol in eggs, and increase antioxidant capacity and immunity in laying ducks."

      "abstract": "The effect of sea buckthorn seed oil (SSO) on exercise-induced fatigue in mice was explored. The animals were randomly divided into a normal control group, exercise-induced fatigue group (EFG), SSO low-dose group, SSO medium-dose group, and SSO high-dose group. The mice in all the groups underwent swimming training for 10 days. Those in the treatment groups received different amounts of SSO (0.85, 1.68, and 3.35 g/kg BW [body weight]) before the exercise. All the animals were sacrificed on the last day after an exhaustive swimming test, and serum, liver, and brain specimens were collected. In the exhaustive swimming test, the swimming durations in the SSO-treated animals were longer than those in the EFG. Furthermore, SSO reduced serum lactic acid, blood urea nitrogen, and hepatic malondialdehyde levels and increased liver glycogen level, hepatic superoxide dismutase level, hypothalamic dopamine content, and glutathione peroxidase level. The SSO treatment decreased hypothalamic 5-hydroxytryptamine content, lipid hydroperoxide level, NLRP3 inflammasome, and interleukin-1β protein expression in the prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, it promoted the protein expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 in the liver. SSO exhibited an excellent antifatigue effect, which may be related to its inhibition of oxidative and inflammatory injury and regulation of hypothalamic neurotransmitters. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: In the present study, the effect of sea buckthorn seed oil on fatigue in mice and its potential mechanism were explored. Taken together, the findings provide insight into the potential role of sea buckthorn seed oil in the development of antifatigue drugs.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Impact of processing on product characteristics, sustainability, traceability, authenticity, and public health along the food chain becomes more and more important not only to the producer but also to the customer and the trust of a consumer toward a brand. In recent years, the number of juices and smoothies containing so called super foods or fruits, which have been \"gently pasteurized,\" has increased significantly. However, the term \"gentle pasteurization\" related to the application of emerging preservation technologies such as pulsed electric fields (PEF), high pressure processing (HPP) or ohmic heating (OH) is not clearly defined. METHODS: Therefore, the presented study investigated the influence of PEF, HPP, OH, and thermal treatment on quality characteristics and microbial safety of sea buckthorn syrup. Syrups from two different varieties were investigated under the following conditions HPP (600 MPa 4-8 min), OH (83°C and 90°C), PEF (29.5 kV/cm, 6 μs, 100 Hz), and thermal (88°C, hot filling). Analyses to test the influence on quality parameters like ascorbic acid (AA), flavonoids, carotenoids, tocopherols, antioxidant activity; metabolomical/chemical profiling (fingerprinting) via U-HPLC-HRMS/MS (here especially flavonoids and fatty acids); sensory evaluation, as well as microbial stability including storage, were conducted. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Independent from the treatment, the samples were stable over 8 weeks of storage at 4°C. The influence on the nutrient content [Ascorbic acid (AA), total antioxidant activity (TAA), total phenolic compounds (TPC), tocopherols (Vit E)] was similar for all tested technologies. Employing statistical evaluation Principal Component Analysis (PCA) a clear clustering based on the processing technologies was observed. Flavonoids as well as fatty acids were significantly impacted by the type of used preservation technology. This was obvious during the storage time of PEF and HPP syrups, where enzyme activity was still active. The color as well as taste of the syrups were found to be more fresh-like for the HPP treated samples."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of sea buckthorn polysaccharide (SBP) on high-fat diet (HFD) induced mice cognitive dysfunctions and attempted to explore its biological mechanisms. Behavior tests (Y-maze and Barnes maze) suggested that SBP effectively alleviated the HFD induced behavioral disorders, which was in accordance with the inhibition of neuroinflammation via suppressing the NF-κB pathway and amelioration of synaptic dysfunction via upregulating CREB/BDNF/TrkB pathway in mice brain. Furthermore, SBP alleviated the gut barrier impairment, inflammatory responses, and lipopolysaccharide invasion into blood circulation via regulating the gut microbiome structure, especially correcting the reduction of Ileibacterium and increase of Lactobacillus, Dubosiella, Olsenella, Helicobacter, and Ruminiclostridium_9 in HFD mice. Therefore, the reversal effects of SBP on gut dysbiosis might be the important reason for its positive effects on cognitive dysfunction induced by HFD in mice.",

      "abstract": "Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) is a small tree, valued for its medicinal properties throughout the ages. Sea buckthorn berries and leaves are a known source of phytochemicals and have been used in the treatment of inflammation, oedema, hypertension, ulcers, and wounds in folk medicine. Sea buckthorn seeds are natural dietary sources of various bioactive compounds as well, but the number of studies on their content and biological properties is still insufficient. For the first time, we examined the phytochemical content and biological activity of sea buckthorn seeds in vitro. We have studied the effect of two extracts-from regular (no thermal processing) and roasted (thermally processed) sea buckthorn seeds-on the levels of oxidative stress induced by H2O2/Fe2+ in plasma, coagulation times, and white thrombus formation (measured by Total Thrombus-formation Analysis System-T-TAS). We observed that sea buckthorn seeds contain diverse flavonoids, mostly glycosides of isorhamnetin, kaempferol, and quercetin, as well as smaller amounts of proanthocyanidins and catechin, triterpenoid saponins, and a number of unidentified polar and hydrophobic compounds. Both extracts inhibited lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation, but only the extract from roasted seeds decreased oxidation of thiol groups in plasma treated with H2O2/Fe2+. They did not alter coagulation times, but the extract from roasted seeds at the highest concentration (50 µg/mL) prolonged the time needed for white thrombus formation. The results indicate that sea buckthorn seeds have antioxidant activity that is not impaired by thermal processing and possess anticoagulant potential, but more research is needed in order to ascertain which compounds are responsible for these effects, especially in in vivo models.",

      "abstract": "Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) is an edible and medicinal plant species. However, due to its sour taste, it is not readily accepted by consumers. To overcome this, fermentation can be used to change its flavor profile. In this study, we used response surface methodology (RSM) to determine the best process for producing fermented sea buckthorn juice (FSBJ) using probiotics. The biological enzyme activity and total flavonoid content (TFC) of sea buckthorn juice (SBJ) increased after fermentation. When the number of bacteria inoculated was 4.08 × 106 CFU/mL and the inoculation ratio was 30% Z. mobilis, 5% L. casei, 13.75% L. plantarum, 31.25% P. acidilactici, 12.5% L. animalis, and 7.5% P. pentosaceus, the amount of sugar was 2.98% (w/v) after 20 h of fermentation at 37°C, and the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity reached 725.44 U/mL, and the TFC reached 2.38 mg/mL. FSBJ demonstrated strong antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Botrytis cinerea. Then, to investigate the antioxidant capacity of FSBJ, we used H2O2 to induce oxidative stress in C2C12 cells and assessed the protection conferred by FSBJ to damaged cells. It was discovered that after 24 h of treatment with FSBJ, not only was there an increase in the activities of intracellular SOD and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), but also a reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS) content, catalase (CAT) activity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content. This research lays the theoretical groundwork and provides reference materials for the improved fermentation of sea buckthorn and demonstrates its resulting antioxidant effect."

      "abstract": "Plants growing in unfavorable environments, such as sea buckthorn, can have a high serotonin content. The potential of using different parts of sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) as a natural source of serotonin was investigated. The feasibility of extracting serotonin hormone from the non-fruit parts of sea buckthorn is demonstrated. One- and two-year-old woody shoots were the best material for obtaining serotonin-containing raw product. Serotonin content in shoots of different sea buckthorn varieties growing in different regions and its dynamics during the vegetation period were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Serotonin is a water-soluble substance prone to microbial degradation, so proper preparation of raw materials plays a very important role in preserving serotonin in plant samples. A method for serotonin extraction using preliminary mechanochemical treatment is presented: it consists in pre-grinding, followed by mechanical treatment of raw materials with 5% adipic acid in a semi-industrial centrifugal mill. The highest degree of serotonin extraction was achieved when using air circulation at a drying temperature of 60-80 °C; serotonin concentration decreased when temperature was further increased. Serotonin content depended on the place and time of harvesting, the method used for drying the branches, and the characteristics of the plant variety. The minimum serotonin concentration (29 mg/g dry basis) was observed during summer; the maximum concentration was observed during winter; the annual changes in concentration can be as significant as 10-fold. The possibility of industrial cultivation and harvesting of different sea buckthorn varieties was also considered.",

Mechanistically, FHJ intervention significantly reversed the microorganism dysbiosis by restoring the microbial diversity, and modulating obesogenic bacteria abundance, like Oscillospira. Furthermore, fermentation altered FHJ's metabolomics, especially flavonoids, contributing to interactions between FHJ and probiotics, like Akkermansia and Lachnospiraceae. Furthermore, short-chain fatty acids, related to ameliorations of MS, were increased by FHJ. This study demonstrated that interactions between metabolomic alterations in FHJ and microorganisms were vital to attenuate MS.",

      "abstract": "Sea buckthorn has strong physiological activities, which might be attributed to its flavonoid compounds. The heat treatment could speed up the transformation of the flavonoids, so it would affect the properties of the flavonoids. To explore the effect of the heat-treating methods on the sea buckthorn pulp flavonoids, the flavonoid compositions, color and taste properties, and antioxidant activity, prepared by three heating methods, were investigated. The results showed that the extractable sea buckthorn flavonoids rose after heat treatment; the high temperature with high-pressure treatment had the largest yield (3.66 ± 0.21 mg/ml). A total of 16 flavonoid monomers were identified in the sea buckthorn, the content of isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside was the highest in the pulp (589.34 ± 4.72 µg/ml), the concentrations of eight monomers increased after heat-treating, and the treating methods could significantly affect the contents of flavonoid monomers (p < 0.05). The difference in color was positively correlated to the heat-treating time and temperature (p < 0.01); the ΔE value in high pressure with high temperature treatment was the largest (10.59). The heat treatment enhanced bitterness and acidity, while it greatly reduced the saltiness, umami, and sweetness (p < 0.01). The stronger antioxidant capacity of the total flavonoids was accompanied by the higher temperature and longer time of heat treatment. The antioxidant capacity was closely correlated to the contents of flavonoid monomers. Therefore, the heat treatment boosted the content of the flavonoids, enhanced the taste, and improved the antioxidant properties. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study can provide suitable a method for improving the extracting efficiency, improving properties and biological activities of sea buckthorn pulp flavonoids, also provide directions for predicting the antioxidant activity by the flavonoid monomer contents.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, the consumer trend towards healthier food choices is unquestionable. Meat products enriched with nutrients, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids and antioxidants, are gaining much more interest among consumers. However, products are susceptible to quality deterioration and a short shelf-life of meat through lipid oxidation due to the lack of antioxidants in the meat. In this regard, the efficacy of dietary sea buckthorn leaves (Hippophaë rhamnoides L.) together with Chromium on the nutritional quality of meat and lipid oxidative stability was investigated. An experiment (28 days long) was carried out on 90 Cobb 500 chickens assigned into three treatments: a control treatment based on corn and soybean meal, without Chromium (T0) and two treatments supplemented either with 0.00002% Chromium (T1) or with 0.00002% Chromium and 2% sea buckthorn leaves (T2). Dietary supplementation of SBL and Cr improved the PUFA/MUFA ratio, DHA concentration and decreased the n-6/n-3 ratio compared to the other treatments. Moreover, the breast and thigh meat belonging to T1 and T2 treatments showed a higher concentration of lutein and zeaxanthin, Fe and Zn and expressed a higher antioxidant capacity compared to those from T0. Furthermore, n-6 and n-3 PUFA deposited preferentially in the thigh meat rather than in the breast meat. The results from the study showed that dietary SBL and Cr significantly improved the fatty acid pattern and the oxidative stability of chicken breast meat, lowering the TBARS level after storage. In conclusion, SBL and Cr are promising dietary bioactive compounds with beneficial effects to obtain nutrient-enriched meat products."

      "abstract": "Background: Sea buckthorn (SBT) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), rich in calcium, phosphorus, and vitamins, which can potentially prevent and treat osteoporosis. However, no research has been conducted to confirm these hypotheses. QiangGuYin (QGY) is a TCM compound used to treat osteoporosis. There is a need to investigate whether SBT enhances QGY efficacy. Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore whether SBT enhances QGY efficacy by inhibiting CKIP-1 and Notum expression through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. The study also aimed to explore the active components of SBT. Methods: Experimental animals were divided into control, model, QGY, SBT, SBT + Eucommia ulmoides (EU), and SBT + QGY groups. After treatment, bone morphometric parameters, such as estrogen, PINP, and S-CTX levels, and Notum, CKIP-1, and β-catenin expression were examined. Screening of SBT active components was conducted by molecular docking to obtain small molecules that bind Notum and CKIP-1. Results: The results showed that all the drug groups could elevate the estrogen, PINP, and S-CTX levels, improve femoral bone morphometric parameters, inhibit Notum and CKIP-1 expression, and promote β-catenin expression. The effect of SBT + EU and SBT + QGY was superior to the others. Molecular docking identified that SBT contains seven small molecules (folic acid, rhein, quercetin, kaempferol, mandenol, isorhamnetin, and ent-epicatechin) with potential effects on CKIP-1 and Notum. Conclusion: SBT improves bone morphometric performance in PMOP rats by inhibiting CKIP-1 and Notum expression, increasing estrogen levels, and activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Furthermore, SBT enhances the properties of QGY. Folic acid, rhein, quercetin, kaempferol, mandenol, isorhamnetin, and ent-epicatechin are the most likely active ingredients of SBT. These results provide insight into the pharmacological mechanisms of SBT in treating osteoporosis."

      "abstract": "The fruit of Hippophae rhamnoides has been widely used for medicinal purposes because of its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiplatelet, and antimicrobial effects. Since there are no clear reports on the therapeutic efficacy of H. rhamnoides in osteoporosis, this study aimed to confirm the potential use of H. rhamnoides for the treatment of osteoporosis through its osteogenic differentiation-promoting effect in ovariectomized mice. Through an in vitro study, we compared the effects of the EtOH extract of H. rhamnoides fruits (EHRF) on the differentiation of C3H10T1/2, a mouse mesenchymal stem cell line, into osteoblasts based on alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining and the relative expression of osteogenesis-related mRNAs. The EHRF significantly stimulated the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblasts and showed 7.5 times (* p < 0.05) higher osteogenesis than in the untreated control. A solvent fractionation process of EHRF showed that the hexane-soluble fraction (HRH) showed 10.4 times (** p < 0.01) higher osteogenesis than in the untreated control. Among the subfractions derived from the active HRH by preparative HPLC fractionation, HRHF4 showed 7.5 times (* p < 0.05) higher osteogenesis than in the untreated naïve cells, and HRH and HRHF4 fractions showed 22.6 times (*** p < 0.001) stronger osteogenesis activity than in the negative control. Osteoporosis was induced by excision of both ovaries in 9-week-old female ICR mice for in vivo analysis, and two active fractions, HRH and HRHF4, were administered orally for three months. During the oral administration period, body weight was measured weekly, and bone mineral density (BMD) and body fat density were measured simultaneously using a DEXA machine once a month. In particular, during the in vivo study, the average BMD of the ovariectomized group decreased by 0.0009 g/cm2, whereas the average BMD of the HRH intake group increased by 0.0033 g/cm2 (* p < 0.05) and that of the HRHF4 intake group increased by 0.0059 g/cm2 (** p < 0.01). The HRH and HRHF4 intake groups significantly recovered the mRNA and protein expression of osteogenic genes, including ALP, Osteopontin, Runx2, and Osterix, in the osteoporosis mouse tibia. These findings suggest that the active fractions of H. rhamnoides fruit significantly promoted osteoblast differentiation in mesenchymal stem cells and increased osteogenic gene expression, resulting in an improvement in bone mineral density in the osteoporosis mouse model. Taken together, H. rhamnoides fruits are promising candidates for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.",

One such diseases is Diabetes mellitus, the prevalence of which is growing and is associated primarily with diet, lack of exercise and/or genetics. This study intends to examine the effects of sea buckthorn and metformin on body weight, water and feed intake, glycaemia, insulinemia, sorbitol accumulation and cataract development in Zucker diabetic fatty rats, which represent an animal model of type 2 Diabetes mellitus, as well as to characterize the individual content of bioactive substances and the antioxidant activity of sea buckthorn. Particular concentrations were applied (500 and 1000 mg.kg-1 body weight of sea buckthorn, and combinations with 150 mg.kg-1 body weight of metformin) by gastric gavage. The total antioxidant capacity and bioactive compounds were determined by spectrophotometric analysis. The best results of the study showed suppression of hyperglycaemia, water intake, decreased sorbitol levels in the lens of the eyes after sea buckthorn treatment. Determination of bioactive compounds showed significantly higher values in dry berries when compared to fresh berries of sea buckthorn and high total antioxidant capacity. Our results represent an interest in sea buckthorn and its potential use in the treatment of Diabetes mellitus as well as other experimental studies.",

The related RCTs from five databases were systematically searched and comprehensively random effects model was used to calculate SMD and 95% CI. The Cochrane deviation risk tool was used to evaluate the deviation risk. Fifteen studies were involved in the meta-analysis. First, sea buckthorn supplementation reduced triglycerides [-0.722 (-1.129, -0.316); p < .001], total cholesterol [-0.345 (-0.639, -0.051); p = .021], low density lipoprotein cholesterol [-0.396 (-0.755, -0.037); p = .031], and increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol [0.370 (0.056, 0.684); p = .021] in overall subjects. Second, subgroup analysis showed that sea buckthorn supplementation reduced lipids only in people with abnormal lipid metabolism. Third, sea buckthorn had no effect on blood sugar, blood pressure, and BMI of the overall subjects. Sea buckthorn may affect the lipid metabolism in circulation, but it cannot affect blood glucose, blood pressure, and BMI. These indicators are closely associated with metabolic syndrome. This study may contribute to the development and utilization of sea buckthorn, and may provide a new and safer way for the prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome. The limitation of this study is high heterogeneity, even if subgroup analysis is used. However, more clinical studies are needed to determine the real effect of sea buckthorn on metabolic syndrome.",

This study aimed to investigate the impact of intervention with sea buckthorn berry puree on plasma metabolomics profile and gut microbiota in hypercholesterolemic subjects. A total of 56 subjects with hypercholesterolemia consumed 90 g of sea buckthorn berry puree daily for 90 days, and plasma metabolomic profile was studied at 0 (baseline), 45, and 90 days of intervention by using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR). Gut microbiota composition was analyzed at the baseline and after 90 days of supplementation by using high-throughput sequencing. The plasma metabolic profile was significantly altered after 45 days of intervention as compared to the baseline (day 0). A clear trend of returning to the baseline metabolomic profile was observed in plasma when the intervention extended from 45 days to 90 days. Despite this, the levels of several key plasma metabolites such as glucose, lactate, and creatine were lowered at day 90 compared to the baseline levels, suggesting an improved energy metabolism in those patients. In addition, intervention with sea buckthorn puree enriched butyrate-producing bacteria and other gut microbes linked to lipid metabolisms such as Prevotella and Faecalibacterium while depleting Parasutterella associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease. These findings indicate that sea buckthorn berries have potential in modulating energy metabolism and the gut microbiota composition in hypercholesterolemic patients."

      "abstract": "Blood platelets play a crucial role in hemostasis, the process responsible for keeping blood flowing in the circulatory system. However, unnecessary platelet activation can lead to aggregation at the site of atherosclerotic plaque rapture and the formation of a thrombus, which promotes atherothrombotic diseases. Various dietary components, such as phenolic compounds, are known to demonstrate antiplatelet and anticoagulant properties, and it is possible that these could form an important element in the prophylaxis and therapy of cardiovascular diseases. Our present study examined the biological activity of isorhamnetin (1) and two isorhamnetin derivatives, (2): 3-O-beta-glucoside-7-O-alpha-rhamnoside and (3): 3-O-beta-glucoside-7-O-alpha-(3″'-isovaleryl)-rhamnoside, isolated from the phenolic fraction of sea buckthorn fruit, against human washed blood platelets and human whole blood in vitro. The anti-platelet and anticoagulant potential was determined using (A) flow cytometry, (B) the thrombus-formation analysis system (T-TAS) and (C) colorimetry. The results of the T-TAS test indicate that the AUC10 (Area Under the Curve) of the tested phenolic compounds (compounds 1, 2 and 3; 50 µg/mL) was markedly reduced compared to the control values. Moreover, flavonol demonstrated anti-platelet potential, including anti-adhesive activity, with these effects being more intense in compound 2 than isorhamnetin. Different actions of flavonol on platelet activation may depend on their binding ability to various receptors on blood platelets. However, the mechanism of their anti-platelet potential requires further additional studies, including in vitro and in vivo experiments.",

Total flavonoids of Hippophae rhamnoides (TFH) are reported to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. AIM: The effects of TFH on atopic dermatitis (AD)-like lesions induced by MC903 in mice was elucidated in the study. METHODS: To induce AD-like lesions, MC903 was adopted to apply repeatedly on the left ear in C57BL/6 mice. After induction of AD-like lesions, 0.5% and 1% TFH cream was applied topically on ears of mice once a day for 8 days. The degree of skin lesions was evaluated by macroscopical and histological methods. Expressions of filaggrin (FLG) was evaluated by Western blotting. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was adopted to detect the mRNA expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL-4), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in skin lesions. In vitro, Cytokine Antibody Arrays were performed to measure production of cytokines in IFN-γ/TNF-α-treated HaCaT cells, Western blotting was employed to detect the expressions of p-NF-κB, p-ERK and p-P38. RESULTS: Topical application of TFH significantly improved the severity of dermatitis by inhibiting the infiltration of mast cell, increasing expression of FLG, decreasing the expressions of TNF-α, IL-4, IFN-γ and TSLP in skin lesions. TFH decreased the levels of IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, MCP-3, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB, thymus and activation regulated chemokine (TARC) in the supernatants of the HaCaT cells treated by IFN-γ/TNF-α. Furthermore, expressions of p-NF-κB, p-ERK and p-P38 were also decreased by TFH administration with dose dependent manner in HaCaT cells treated by IFN-γ/TNF-α. CONCLUSIONS: Topical application of TFH improved AD-like lesions in mice induced by MC903. Which exerted the effects of anti-inflammation and repairing skin barrier by regulating Th1/Th2 balance. This finding indicates that TFH is a novel potential agent for the external treatment of AD.",

Sea buckthorn (SBT) vegetation is currently poorly studied. The purpose of this research was to assess the composition and potential of SBT twigs as a source of valuable biologically active substances. Water and 50% EtOH extracts of twigs of three Latvian SBT cultivars with a high berry yield and quality, popular for cultivation in many countries (H. rhamnoides 'Maria Bruvele', 'Tatiana', 'Botanicheskaya Lubitelskaya'), were investigated for the first time. The phytochemical composition (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis) and biological activity of the obtained hydrophilic extracts were determined. The highest yield of polyphenolic compounds and serotonin was observed for 'Maria Bruvele'. Hydrophilic extracts were investigated for radical scavenging activity (DPPH˙ test), antibacterial/antifungal activity against five pathogenic bacteria/yeast, cytotoxicity, and the enzymatic activity of alpha-amylase (via in vitro testing), which is extremely important for the treatment of people with underweight, wasting, and malabsorption. The results showed a high potential of sea buckthorn biomass as a source of valuable biologically active compounds for the creation of preparations for the food industry, nutraceuticals, and cosmetics."

The IDF was treated with ball milling and cellulase treatment to obtain co-modified insoluble dietary fiber (CIDF). The physicochemical and functional properties of IDF, milled insoluble dietary fiber (MIDF), and CIDF were studied. After treatments, MIDF had smaller particle sizes and a looser structure, and CIDF exhibited a wrinkled surface and sparse porous structure according to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction. Compared to IDF, MIDF and CIDF showed improved water-holding, oil-binding, and swelling capacities, improved by 16.13, 14.29, and 15.38%, and 38.5, 22.2, and 25.0%, for MIDF and CIDF, respectively. The cation exchange ability of modified samples showed improvement as well. Treatments also changed the fluidity of MIDF and CIDF. Due to the smaller particles and increased stacking, the bulk density (BD) and angle of repose of MIDF improved by 33.3% and 4.1° compared to IDF, whereas CIDF had a looser structure and thus decreased by 7.1% and 13.3° with increased fluidity. Moreover, the modification also enhanced the effects of CIDF on glucose adsorption, glucose diffusion inhibition, starch digestion inhibition, starch pasting interference, and α-amylase activity inhibition.

      "abstract": "Pomaces of sea buckthorn berry were usually side-products during the processing of juice. Due to a lack of an economical and effective extraction method, it was typically recognized as waste. For the purpose of resource utilization, the mechanochemical-assisted extraction (MCAE) method was applied to develop an ecofriendly extraction method and product with better pharmacology activity. The parameters were investigated through response surface methodology (RSM) design experiments. The processing conditions were optimized as follows: amount of Na2CO3 40%, ball-to-material rate 29:1 g/g, milling speed 410 rpm, milling time 24 min, extraction temperature 25 °C, extraction time 20 min and the solid-to-solution ratio 1:10 g/mL. Under these conditions, the yields of flavonoids from sea buckthorn pomaces were 26.82 ± 0.53 mg/g, which corresponds to an increase of 2 times in comparison with that extracted by the heat reflux extraction method. Meanwhile, the hepatoprotective activity of sea buckthorn pomaces extracts was studied by the liver injury induced by ip injection of tetracycline. Biochemical and histopathological studies showed that biomarkers in serum and liver of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) mice were significantly ameliorated when sea buckthorn flavonoids extracted by MCAE were used. Altogether, these results demonstrate that, as a green and efficient extraction, MCAE treatment could increase the extraction yield of sea buckthorn flavonoids, meanwhile it could exhibit significant activity of improving liver function. This research provided a new way to use pomaces of sea buckthorn as a functional food. It also has great value on the comprehensive utilization of nature's resources.",

      "abstract": "In plants, recent studies have revealed that N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation of mRNA has potential regulatory functions of this mRNA modification in many biological processes. m6A methyltransferase, m6A demethylase and m6A-binding proteins can cause differential phenotypes, indicating that m6A may have critical roles in the plant. In this study, we depicted the m6A map of sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides Linn.) transcriptome. Similar to A. thaliana, m6A sites of sea buckthorn transcriptome is significantly enriched around the stop codon and within 3'-untranslated regions (3'UTR). Gene ontology analysis shows that the m6A modification genes are associated with metabolic biosynthesis. In addition, we identified 13,287 different m6A peaks (DMPs) between leaf under drought (TR) and control (CK) treatment. It reveals that m6A has a high level of conservation and has a positive correlation with mRNA abundance in plants. GO and KEGG enrichment results showed that DMP modification DEGs in TR were particularly associated with ABA biosynthesis. Interestingly, our results showed three m6A demethylase (HrALKBH10B, HrALKBH10C and HrALKBH10D) genes were significantly increased following drought stress, which indicated that it may contributed the decreased m6A levels. This exhaustive m6A map provides a basis and resource for the further functional study of mRNA m6A modification in abiotic stress.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this research was to show the effect of the ozonation process on the quality of sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.). The quality of the ozonated berries of sea buckthorn was assessed. Prior to and after the ozone treatment, a number of parameters, including the mechanical properties, moisture content, microbial load, content of bioactive compounds, and composition of volatile compounds, were determined. The influence of the ozonation process on the composition of volatile compounds and mechanical properties was demonstrated. The ozonation had negligible impact on the weight and moisture of the samples immediately following the treatment. Significant differences in water content were recorded after 7 days of storage. It was shown that the highest dose of ozone (concentration and process time) amounting to 100 ppm for 30 min significantly reduced the water loss. The microbiological analyses showed the effect of ozone on the total count of aerobic bacteria, yeast, and mold. The applied process conditions resulted in the reduction of the number of aerobic bacteria colonies by 3 log cfu g-1 compared to the control (non-ozonated) sample, whereas the number of yeast and mold colonies decreased by 1 log cfu g-1 after the application of 100 ppm ozone gas for 30 min. As a consequence, ozone treatment enhanced the plant quality and extended plant's storage life."

      "abstract": "Sea buckthorn (SB) has been indicated to have hypoglycemic potential, but its effects on glucose in people with impaired glucose regulation (IGR) are still unclear. This work presents a randomized, double-blinded, two-way crossover study. A total of 38 subjects with IGR completed the intervention of consuming sea buckthorn fruit puree (SBFP, 90 mL/day, five weeks), washing out (four weeks), and then consuming placebo (90 mL/day, five weeks) or in reverse order. In our methodology, a unified questionnaire was used to gather information on physical activity and dietary intakes, and physical examinations were performed to measure blood pressure, height, and weight. Fasting blood samples were collected to detect the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycated serum protein (GSP). To calculate the area under the curve of 2 h postprandial plasma glucose (2 h PG-AUC), blood samples at t = 30, 60, and 120 min were also collected and analyzed. Effects of the intervention were evaluated by paired-sample Wilcoxon test and mixed model analyses. Our results show that the FPG in subjects with IGR decreased by a median reduction of 0.14 mmol/L after five weeks' consumption of SBFP, but increased by a median of 0.07 mmol/L after placebo intervention, and the comparison of these two interventions was statistically significant (p = 0.045). During the wash-out period, a similar difference was observed as the FPG decreased in the group that received SBFP intervention first, but increased in another group (p = 0.043). Both SBFP and placebo significantly raised GSP during the intervention period, but lowered it in the wash-out period (p < 0.05), while no significant difference was found between the two interventions. The 2 h PG-AUC remained relatively stable throughout the study. Our results indicated that consumption of SBFP for five weeks showed a slight downward trend on FPG in subjects with IGR."

We conducted this clinical trial to evaluate the period of wound healing with sea buckthorn dressings for the second-degree burns and compare the results with 1% silver sulfadiazine (SSD) dressings. This randomized triple-blind clinical trial was conducted in a hospital in Isfahan, Iran. Fifty-five patients suffering second-degree burns were recruited through convenient sampling and randomly divided into two groups and treated with either sea buckthorn cream or 1% SSD. Wound dressings were done until complete wound healing was attained. The process of healing burns was monitored using the Bates-Jensen Wound Assessment Tool; complete healing was determined by using the standard burn healing checklist. It was deduced that the period of healing second-degree burns in the group treated with sea buckthorn cream was shorter than the group treated with 1% SSD (p < 0.001). The results demonstrated the greater clinical efficacy of sea buckthorn cream over 1% SSD for healing second-degree burns. It was concluded that using sea buckthorn dressing by reducing the period of wound healing can shorten the course of treatment of second-degree burns as well as reduce the burden of care in health care services.",

On the other hand, saponins also exhibit a number of beneficial properties, such as antioxidant properties. Thus, saponins can be considered both in terms of their therapeutic and protective effects during anticancer treatment. In this study, we investigated the effect of the saponin fraction isolated from sea buckthorn (Elaeagnus rhamnoides (L.) A. Nelson) leaves on the viability of HL-60 cancer cells using resazurin assay and its ability to induction of apoptosis with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) double staining. Moreover, we studied its effect on the oxidative stress induced by H2O2, and anti-platelet and anticoagulant potential in whole blood using T-TAS, a microchip-based flow chamber system. We observed that the saponin fraction significantly decreased the viability of HL-60 cells at the concentration above 50 µg/mL and induced apoptosis at the concentration of 100 µg/mL. Moreover, we observed that saponin fraction used at lower concentrations, such as 0.5 and 1 µg/mL, stimulated HL-60 cells and increased their viability. The saponin fraction also decreased the level of free radicals and reduced oxidative DNA damage measured by the comet assay. However, at high concentration of oxidant H2O2 equal 5 mM, we noticed that the saponin fraction at 50 µg/mL increased the level of free radicals in HL-60 cells. We also demonstrated anticoagulant potential of the saponin fraction at the concentration of 50 µg/mL. Our results indicate that the saponin fraction obtained from sea buckthorn leaves can show both chemotherapeutic and chemoprotective potential.",

Low-polarity fractions from fruit (OL), twigs (GL) and leaves (LL) were investigated. Compared to the previous scientific reports a more detailed analysis of the chemical composition of individual fractions was performed. Cytotoxicity of low-polarity fractions has been investigated and activity compared in human tumor and normal cells cultured in vitro. The genotoxicity and pro-apoptotic properties of low-polarity fractions were also followed on selected cell lines that had proved to be the most sensitive. In the proposed research model being tested, low-polarity fractions act cytotoxically, even 3 times more strongly in cancer cells than normal ones. Measurement of caspase 3/7 activity indicated that cell death occurs through apoptosis. Furthermore, high concentrations of low-polarity fractions have moderate genotoxic properties. Data obtained on the biological properties of low-polarity fractions from sea-buckthorn show that these fractions can potentially support cancer cells elimination. Phytotochemical analysis indicates the key role of the triterpenoids in this process.",

SB is well known more than just a fruit. So far, a unique mixture of bioactive components was elucidated in SB including flavonoids, phenolic acids, proanthocyanidins, carotenoids, fatty acids, triterpenoids, vitamins and phytosterols, which implied the great medicinal worth of this seaberry. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments, ranged from cell lines to animals as well as a few in patients and healthy volunteers, indicated that SB possessed various biological activities including anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, antioxidant properties, anti-cancer activities, hepato-protection, cardiovascular-protection, neuroprotection, radioprotection, skin protection effect as well as the protective effect against some eye and gastrointestinal sickness. Furthermore, the toxicological results revealed neither the fruits, nor the seeds of SB were toxic. The present review summarizes the unique profile of the chemical compounds, the nutritional and health effects as well as the toxicological properties of SB, which lay the foundation for practical applications of SB in treatment of human diseases."

Physical examination and analysis of lipid markers, hsCRP concentrations and cell adhesion protein concentrations with fasting blood samples were performed at 0-day, 45-day and 90-day after treatment. We found that the sea buckthorn puree did not affect the levels of serum total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride (TG). However, the level of HDL-C was decreased by sea buckthorn puree in a short period (first 6 weeks), which was increased in the last 6 weeks (p < 0.05). Compared with placebo, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was decreased after taking sea buckthorn puree (p > 0.05). There was moderately decreased in hsCRP concentration in sea buckthorn group. Nevertheless, there was no correlation between changes in ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 concentration.

      "abstract": "Sea buckthorn is an important ecological and economic tree species, and its berries have been severely damaged by sea buckthorn fruit fly, Rhagoletis batava obseuriosa Kol. (Diptera: Tephritidae) (RBO). Brassinosteroid (BR) is widely involved in stress tolerance of plant. However, limited knowledge exists regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying insect resistance. Here, we found that BR content was much higher in sea buckthorn fruits with RBO infection than non-infection, and the damage rates of fruit with BR treatment were significantly lower than that of non-treatment. It indicated that BR could enhance RBO resistance in sea buckthorn. Several BR biosynthesis-related HrCYPs genes (CYP85A1/85A2/90A1/90B1/90C1/90D1/92A6/724B/734A1) were obtained and identified based on transcriptome analysis, of which the most up-regulated gene in fruits was HrCYP90B1 under RBO and mechanical damage. Overexpression of HrCYP90B1 in Arabidopsis thaliana showed BR and salicylic acid (SA) content was significantly increased, and the substrate campesterol (CR) of HrCYP90B1 content decreased. Further studies revealed that silencing HrCYP90B1 by virus-induced gene silencing resulted in decrease of BR, SA and defense-related enzymes contents, and increase of CR content. Silencing HrCYP90B1 also caused suppression of SA and activation of jasmonic acid pathways, enabling enhanced RBO susceptibility and more damage of fruits. Taken together, we obtained evidence that HrCYP90B1 was a positive regulator in RBO resistance improvement in sea buckthorn, which will provide comprehensive insights into the tree defense system of sea buckthorn to pest infection.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies reported that sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L., Elaeagnaceae, HRP) exhibits hepatoprotective effects via its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties as well as its inhibitory effects on collagen synthesis. However, it is unclear whether this hepatoprotective effect is also achieved by regulating liver drug metabolism enzyme pathways. Herein, we examined the regulatory effect of HRP on cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) in rats with immune liver injury, and explored the molecular mechanism of its hepatoprotective effect. Rat models of immunological liver injury were induced by intravenous injections of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG; 125 mg kg-1; 2 wks). Specific protein levels were detected by ELISA or western blot, and CYP3A mRNA expression was detected by RT-PCR. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) detected relative changes in CYP3A metabolic activity based on the rates of 1-hydroxylation of the probe drug midazolam (MDZ). BCG pretreatment (125 mg kg-1) significantly down-regulated liver CYP3A protein expression compared with the control, metabolic activity, and transcription levels while up-regulating liver NF-κB, IL-1β, TNF-α and iNOS. HRP intervention (ED50: 78 mg kg-1) moderately reversed NF-κB, inflammatory cytokines, and iNOS activation in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05), and suppressed CYP3A down-regulation (P < 0.05); thereby partially alleviating liver injury. During immune liver injury, HRP may reverse CYP3A down-regulation by inhibiting NF-κB signal transduction, and protect liver function, which involves regulation of enzymes transcriptionally, translationally and post-translationally. The discovery that NF-κB is a molecular target of HRP may initiate the development and optimization of a clinical therapeutic approach to mitigate hepatitis B and other immunity-related liver diseases.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a worldwide chronic skin disease which burden public health. Sea buckthorn (SBT) (Hippophae rhamnoides L., Elaeagnaceae) oil, as a traditional herbal medicine, has been used for disease treatment for many years. The effects of SBT oil on AD mouse model induced by repeated administration of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) in BALB/c mice was evaluated in this study. METHODS: Mice were divided into four groups including the normal control group, AD model group, AD model group treated with SBT oil (5 ml/kg) and AD model group treated with SBT oil (10 ml/kg). Same volume at different concentrations of SBT oil was applied daily on the latter two groups by gavage for 15 days following AD model induction. The function of skin barrier and the production of IL-4, IFN-γ, TNF-α and TSLP were examined after animal sacrifice. The migration and mature of langerhans cell (LCs) in lymph node was further assessed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: SBT oil alleviated dermatitis scores, decreased ear thickness, prevented infiltration of mast cell, reduced lymph node weight and depressed activity of Th2 cells. SBT oil also reduced the expression of IL-4, IFN-γ, TNF-α and TSLP in ear tissue, IgE level in serum and mRNA relative expression of IL-4, IFN-γ, TNF-α in lymph node. Moreover, SBT oil inhibited the migration of LCs cells from local lesions to lymph node and it's mature in lymph node. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest SBT oil had a beneficial effect either systemic or regional on DNCB-induced AD mice via maintain the balance of Th1/Th2 and may be a potential complementary candidate for AD treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Medications to reduce oxidative stress are preventing cellular damage associated with hyperlipidemia. In this regard, statins (e.g., atorvastatin) act primarily by decrease in low-density lipoprotein-c but, in the last decade, hepatotoxicity, associated with liver injuries in the next months after treatments' initiation, was reported. In this case, associated phytotherapy can be a solution. PURPOSE: To investigate the antioxidant potential and response to free radicals, in the case of hyperlipidemic rats treated with atorvastatin. Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) and a grape extract (antioxivita) efficiency in the oxidative stress were investigated, also being ascertained the rats' organs cytoarchitecture. METHODS: Eighty-four hyperlipidemic Wistar rats were divided into seven groups and orally treated as follows: ATS, atorvastatin (20 mg/kg·bw); ATS + Hr, atorvastatin + H. rhamnoides; ATS + Aox, atorvastatin + grape extract; Hr, H. rhamnoides; and Aox, grape extract (both as 100 mg/kg·bw). HFD and Control received high fat diet and normal fodder only. After two and six months, respectively, rats were euthanized and the heart, liver, and kidneys were gathered. The tissue samples were prepared by homogenization of 0.5 g tissue, in ethanol, kept for 48 hours at 4°C-10°C and then filtered, in order to assess organs' cytoarchitecture and the TAC's values (by using cupric ion reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) assay). The test tubes were incubated, at room temperature, for 30 minutes, and then analyzed using a spectrophotometer at 450-650 nm. RESULTS: The statistics (ANOVA) revealed that sea buckthorn diminished notably (p < 0.001) the oxidative stress in the heart, liver, and kidney. After six months, the TAC's reduced levels for the heart were significant (p < 0.001) in ATS + Aox. In the case of histology, the liver's cytoarchitecture in ATS revealed abnormal cytoarchitecture. In ATS + Hr, ATS + Aox, Hr, and Aox, cell regeneration improved in different stages, especially for ATS + Hr and ATS + Aox, in comparison with HFD, which exhibited fat degeneration. Kidney's cytoarchitecture revealed cellular healing, especially in ATS + Hr and ATS + Aox."

      "abstract": "Sea-buckthorn flavonoids (SFs) have been used as functional food components for their bioactive potential in preventing metabolic complications caused by diet, such as obesity and inflammation. However, the protective effect of SFs on cognitive functions is not fully clear. In this study, a high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFFD)-induced obese mice model was treated with SFs for 14 weeks. It was found that the oral SF administration (0.06% and 0.31% w/w, mixed in diet) significantly reduced bodyweight gain and insulin resistance in the HFFD-fed mice. SFs significantly prevented HFFD-induced neuronal loss and memory impairment in behavioral tests. Additionally, SFs also suppressed the HFFD-induced synaptic dysfunction and neuronal damages by increasing the protein expressions of PSD-95. Furthermore, SF treatment activated the ERK/CREB/BDNF and IRS-1/AKT pathways and inactivated the NF-κB signaling and its downstream inflammatory mediator expressions. In conclusion, SFs are a potential nutraceutical to prevent high-energy density diet-induced cognitive impairments, which could be possibly explained by their mediating effects on insulin signaling and inflammatory responses in the brain.",

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have the potential to improve plant growth and soil properties. We aimed to assess the effects of AMF on the growth and soil properties of sea buckthorn under field conditions at different reclamation times. Inoculation with AMF significantly promoted the survival rate of sea buckthorn over a 50-month period, while also increasing plant height after 14, 26, and 50 months. Crown width after 14 months and ground diameter after 50 months of inoculation treatment were significantly higher than in the uninoculated treatment. AMF inoculation significantly improved plant mycorrhizal colonization rate and promoted an increase in mycelial density in the rhizosphere soil. The pH and electrical conductivity of rhizosphere soil also increased after inoculation. Moreover, after 26 and 50 months the soil organic matter in the inoculation treatment was significantly higher than in the control. The number of inoculated soil rhizosphere microorganisms, as well as acid phosphatase activity, also increased. AMF inoculation may play an active role in promoting plant growth and improving soil quality in the long term and is conducive to the rapid ecological restoration of damaged mining areas.",

      "abstract": "Hippophae rhamnoides L. (Elaeagnaceae; commonly known as \"sea buckthorn\" and \"vitamin tree\"), is a spiny deciduous shrub whose fruit is used in foods and traditional medicines. The H. rhamnoides fruit (berry) is rich in vitamin C, with a level exceeding that found in lemons and oranges. H. rhamnoides berries are usually washed and pressed to create pomace and juice. Today, the powder of the aqueous extract of H. rhamnoides berries are sold as a functional food in many countries. As part of our ongoing effort to identify bioactive constituents from natural resources, we aimed to isolate and identify those from the fruits of H. rhamnoides. Phytochemical analysis of the extract of H. rhamnoides fruits led to the isolation and identification of six compounds, namely, a citric acid derivative (1), a phenolic (2), flavonoids (3 and 4), and megastigmane compounds (5 and 6). Treatment with compounds 1-6 did not have any impact on the cell viability of RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages. However, pretreatment with these compounds suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NO production in RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages in a concentration-dependent manner. Among the isolated compounds, compound 1 was identified as the most active, with an IC50 of 39.76 ± 0.16 μM. This value was comparable to that of the NG-methyl-L-arginine acetate salt, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor with an IC50 of 28.48 ± 0.05 μM. Western blot analysis demonstrated that compound 1 inhibited the LPS-induced expression of IKKα/β (IκB kinase alpha/beta), I-κBα (inhibitor of kappa B alpha), nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) p65, iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase), and COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) in RAW 264.7 cells. Furthermore, LPS-stimulated cytokine production was detected using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Compound 1 decreased interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) production in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. In summary, the mechanism of action of 1 included the suppression of LPS-induced NO production in RAW 264.7 cells by inhibiting IKKα/β, I-κBα, NF-κB p65, iNOS, and COX-2, and the activities of IL-6 and TNF-α."

The ability of the ZnO/NF to degrade cationic and anionic dyes, including malachite green (MG), Congo red (CR), methylene blue (MB), and eosin Y (EY), under ultraviolet illumination was studied. The photocatalyst degraded approximately 99% of the MG, MB, CR and EY dyes within 70, 70, 80, and 90 min of contact time, respectively, at a dye concentration of 15 mg/L, 5 mg/L, SBT-ZnO/NF degraded 100% of the MG, MB, CR and EY dyes within 23, 25, 28, and 30 min, respectively. The results indicate that SBT-ZnO/NFs as synthesized is an inexpensive, non-toxic, rapid, and reusable photocatalyst that can play an enhanced role in wastewater treatment."

      "abstract": "Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by circumscribed, red, thickened plaques with overlying silvery white scales. It is associated with the release of pro-inflammatory mediators that lead to the development of edema and distress. Here we show the anti-inflammatory and anti-psoriatic efficacies of a neutraceutical sea buckthorn oil (SBKT) derived from the fruit pulp of Hippophae rhamnoides. Chemical analysis of the SBKT showed the presence of 16 major saturated, mono-, and polyunsaturated fatty acids components, imparting significant nutritional values. Efficacy of the SBKT in modulating psoriasis and associated inflammation was first tested in vitro using human monocytic (THP-1) cells. SBKT induced cytotoxicity at a dose of ≥25 µl/ml. Treatment of the lipopolysaccharide-stimulated THP-1 cells with SBKT subdued the enhanced release of intracellular reactive nitrogen species and expression of NF-κB protein, in a concentration-dependent manner. This was accompanied by a reduction in the release of downstream pro-inflammatory cytokines: Interleukin-1ß and interleukin-6. Tumor necrosis factor-α released in the stimulated THP-1 cells were also inhibited by SBKT dose of 5 µl/ml. In vivo oral and topical treatment with SBKT in the Carrageenan-stimulated paw edema model, showed a significant decrease in paw volume and edema. In the 12-O tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) stimulated CD-1 mice psoriasis-like model, concurrent oral and tropical SBKT treatments substantially reduced ear edema and ear biopsy weights. Histopathologically, significant reduction in ear epidermal thickness and skin lesion scores was observed in the SBKT-treated animals. In conclusion, SBKT showed anti-inflammatory and anti-psoriasis-like efficacies in healing chemical-induced inflammation and psoriasis. The possible mode of action of SBKT was found through inhibition of reactive nitrogen species, and downregulation of NF-κB protein and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, the present data suggest that Sea buckthorn oil can be used as an anti-inflammatory and anti-psoriatic nutraceutical."

The sea buckthorn (Elaeagnus rhamnoides (L.) A. Nelson) berries are rich in flavonoids and non-polar compounds. In this study, the activity of the phenolic fraction from the sea buckthorn berries was evaluated in vitro in comparison with three phenolic compounds: isorhamnetin (compound 1) and its two new derivatives: compound 2 (isorhamnetin 3-O-beta-glucoside-7-O-alfa-rhamnoside) and compound 3 (isorhamnetin 3-O-beta-glucoside-7-O-alfa-(3\"'-isovaleryl)-rhamnoside). The impact of these phenolic compounds and the phenolic fraction against the effect of the donor of hydroxyl radicals - H2O2/Fe on proteins and lipids in human plasma was measured. Additionally, the aim of the study was to determine the effect of these phenolic compounds and the phenolic fraction on various typical hemostasis parameters. Our results show that the used derivatives of isorhamnetin possess different biological properties (e.g. antioxidant, anti-platelet and anticoagulant). The tested compounds can be seen as new natural beneficial compounds to be used in prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.",

      "abstract": "Psoriasis is one of the most common chronic dermatological conditions, with a strong impact on patients' quality of life. Currently, psoriasis benefits from conventional therapy with a high rate of adverse effects and an increase in non-compliance and self-medication of patients. As such, there is a need to pinpoint low-adverse effects and accessible remedies for this condition. Our single-blind, placebo-controlled study assessed the effect of sea buckthorn extract on psoriasis lesions in previously untreated patients. Our results showed an improvement in Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) scores and in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores when compared to the baseline values, as well as at the 4- and 8-week time marks for the lesions treated with sea buckthorn extract. By contrast, the measurements for the placebo treated lesions showed no alteration at the 4-week mark, and significant worsening at the end of the trial. These findings provide a solid, optimistic base for the in-depth research of sea buckthorn as an adjuvant or a component in psoriasis care protocols."

Preliminary data showed that the components, C13, C15, and C32, exhibited profound inhibitory effect on the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) induced by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and decreased the levels of inflammatory factors. Furthermore, these compounds over-regulated the proteins of DNA damage signaling pathway and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Moreover, active components of sea buckthorn berry (ACSB) treatment attenuated fibrosis development in rats after bile duct ligation (BDL), reducing liver injury and inflammation, and reviving liver function in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, ACSB down-regulated the expression of α-SMA, while over-regulating the DNA damage signaling pathway and the related genes. These suggest that ACSB inhibit DNA repair of HSCs, make them in a damaged state, inhibit the expression of TGF-β, and induce apoptosis.",

There is a growing need for natural compounds that will protect these sensitive molecules from damage, without harmful side effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of sea buckthorn seed oil on the redox balance and lipid metabolism in UV irradiated cells formed different skin layers to examine whether it had a protective effect. Human keratinocytes and fibroblasts were subjected to UVA (ultraviolet type A; 30 J/cm² and 20 J/cm²) or UVB (ultraviolet type B; 60 mJ/cm² and 200 mJ/cm², respectively) radiation and treated with sea buckthorn seed oil (500 ng/mL), and the redox activity was estimated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and enzymatic/non-enzymatic antioxidants activity/level (using electron spin resonance (ESR), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and spectrophotometry). Lipid metabolism was measured by the level of fatty acids, lipid peroxidation products, endocannabinoids and phospholipase A2 activity (GC/MS (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry), LC/MS (liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry), and spectrophotometry). Also, transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear erythroid 2-related factor) and its activators/inhibitors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) and cannabinoid receptor levels were measured (Western blot). Sea buckthorn oil partially prevents UV-induced ROS generation and enhances the level of non-enzymatic antioxidants such as glutathione (GSH), thioredoxin (Trx) and vitamins E and A. Moreover, it stimulates the activity of Nrf2 leading to enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity. As a result, decreases in lipid peroxidation products (4-hydroxynonenal, 8-isoprostaglandin) and increases in the endocannabinoid receptor levels were observed. Moreover, sea buckthorn oil treatment enhanced the level of phospholipid and free fatty acids, while simultaneously decreasing the cannabinoid receptor expression in UV irradiated keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The main differences in sea buckthorn oil on various skin cell types was observed in the case of PPARs-in keratinocytes following UV radiation PPAR expression was decreased by sea buckthorn oil treatment, while in fibroblasts the reverse effect was observed, indicating an anti-inflammatory effect. With these results, sea buckthorn seed oil exhibited prevention of UV-induced disturbances in redox balance as well as lipid metabolism in skin fibroblasts and keratinocytes, which indicates it is a promising natural compound in skin photo-protection."

A total of forty1/2 Dorper × 1/2 thin-tailed Han ram lambs (BW = 22.2 ± 0.92 kg, age =120 ± 11 d; mean ± SD) were selected and divided into four groups in a randomized design and were randomly allocated to one of four treatment diets. Diets were formulated isonitrogenously and contained different levels of SBP: 1) 0% SBP (control), 2) 7.8% of DM SBP (8SBP), 3) 16.0% of DM SBP (16SBP), and 4) 23.5% of DM SBP (24SBP). A portion of corn and forages were replaced with SBP. DMI and ADG increased linearly (P = 0.001), but feed efficiency was not affected (P ≥ 0.460) by increasing SBP inclusion rate. As the SBP inclusion increased, OM, NDF, and ADF digestibility decreased linearly (P ≤ 0.005) and that CP increased linearly (P = 0.012). Response to inclusion level of SBP was quadratic (P = 0.003) for the estimated microbial CP yield with the greatest at intermediate SBP levels. For intestinally absorbable dietary protein, quadratic (P = 0.029) effects were observed among treatments. The metabolizable protein (MP) supplies were linearly (P < 0.0001) improved with increasing SBP inclusion rate. The results indicated that SBP can be incorporated in the ration of ram lambs and improve MP supply and ADG. However, high content of it in the diet was adverse for nutrient digestibility. The optimal proportion was 16.0% under the condition of this experiment.",

      "abstract": "Various parts of sea buckthorn [Elaeagnus rhamnoides (L.) A. Nelson], particularly the berries, known also as seaberries, or Siberian pineapples, are characterized by a unique composition of bioactive compounds: phenolic compounds, vitamins (especially vitamin C), unsaturated fatty acids, and phytosterols such as beta-sitosterol. These berries, together with the juices, jams, and oils made from them, have a range of beneficial antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. This short review discusses whether sea buckthorn may represent a \"golden mean\" for the treatment of cancers: It has anti-proliferation properties and can induce apoptosis and stimulate the immune system, and sea buckthorn oil counteracts many side effects of chemotherapy by restoring kidney and liver function, increasing appetite, and keeping patients in general good health. Although the anticancer activity of sea buckthorn has been confirmed by many in vitro and animal in vivo studies, the treatment and prophylactic doses for humans are unknown. Therefore, greater attention should be paid to the development of well-controlled and high-quality clinical experiments in this area."

However, studies in turkeys are lacking. Hence, the present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of SBT and giloe leaf meal by dietary feed supplementation in turkey poults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1-day-old turkey poults (n=84) of small white variety were distributed into four dietary treatments having three replicates each with seven birds. The study was conducted in turkey poults during 0-8 weeks of age. During the experiment, the poults were fed basal ration (28% crude protein [CP], 2800 Kcal/kg ME) T1, T2-basal ration was supplemented with SBT leaf meal powder at 0.5%, T3-basal ration was supplemented with giloe leaf meal powder at 0.5%, and T4-basal ration was fed along with supplementation of both SBT at 0.5% and giloe leaf meal powder at 0.5%. RESULTS: T2 turkey poults had a significantly higher (p<0.01) body weight gain than T3 and T4 at 7th week of age. Weekly body weight gain was significantly higher (p<0.05) in T2 than T3 during 5th-8th week and 0-8th week of the growth phase. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) was significantly better (p<0.01) in T2 than other treatment groups during 4th-8th week phase of growth (2.09 vs. 2.36, 2.29 and 2.31). Further, FCR was significantly better (p<0.01) in T2 group as compared to other treatment groups during 0-8th week of growth phase (1.95 vs. 2.21, 2.21 and 2.12). Plasma uric acid was found significantly increased (p<0.05) in T1 than T3 and T4, and alkaline phosphatase value was significantly higher (p<0.05) in T1 and T3 than T2. Zinc content of breast (pectoralis major) muscles was significantly higher (p<0.05) in T2 and T4 as compared to T1, while ether extract (EE) in thigh (ilio tibialis) muscles was significantly higher (p<0.05) in T2 as compared to the other treatment groups. CONCLUSION: It may be concluded that supplementation of SBT leaf meal at 0.5% may improve production performance of turkey poults. Supplementation of 0.5% SBT leaf meal may result in higher levels of zinc and EE in the breast and thigh cuts of turkey poults."

      "abstract": "There is evidence that sea buckthorn, as a source of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), possesses health-enhancing properties and may modulate neuroendocrine and immune functions. In the present study, we investigated the effect of sea buckthorn pomace (SBP) supplementation in the diet of growing German Landrace pigs on fatty acids in the blood and hypothalamus, peripheral immune parameters and mRNA expression of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the hypothalamus and spleen. Pigs were fed diets supplemented with 12% of dried SBP or 0% SBP (control group) over an intervention period of eight weeks. The fatty acid profiles in blood plasma were significantly affected by SBP supplementation only for C18:2n-6 and n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio compared with the control group. SBP supplementation did not significantly affect the fatty acid concentrations in the hypothalamus. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in mRNA expression of CRH, MR and GR in the hypothalamus or of GR mRNA expression in the spleen. Concerning the immune status, the plasma IgG levels tended to be higher in SBP pigs, whereas the leukocyte distribution, mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation, and serum IgM levels remained unchanged. In conclusion, the SBP supplementation of the diet only caused moderate effects on fatty acid metabolism, but no significant effects on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity and immunity in growing pigs. It seems that a beneficial effect of dietary n-3 PUFA on health and welfare is more likely to be expected during stressful situations.",

This study analysed and elucidated differences between the normal mice group, diabetic mice group, and sea buckthorn protein supplemented group, and the structures of respective intestinal flora. The mice supplemented with sea buckthorn protein exhibited an obvious drop in body weight and blood glucose levels. The Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, and Clostridium coccoides populations recovered. The amplification of the 16S rDNA gene V3 region revealed that the species of intestinal microbes in the treatment group were adjusted to a certain extent.

SBL harvested in August had the highest total phenolic and flavonoid contents and antioxidant capacity. Treatment of neuronal PC-12 cells with the ethyl acetate fraction of SBL harvested in August increased their viability and membrane integrity and reduced intracellular oxidative stress in a dose-dependent manner. The relative populations of both early and late apoptotic PC-12 cells were decreased by treatment with the SBL ethyl acetate fraction, based on flow cytometry analysis using annexin V-FITC/PI staining.

Heating the sea buckthorn extract resulted in structural changes that led to red- or blue-shifts in maximum emission, depending on temperature and excitation wavelengths. The attenuated total reflectance analysis of the sea buckthorn extract revealed a satisfactory thermostability of compounds at high temperatures. A fractional conversion kinetic model was used to describe the mechanism of degradation in terms of rate and activation energy. Activation energies for total carotenoids, polyphenolic, flavonoids, and antioxidant activity were 8.45±0.93kJ/mol, 2.50±0.66kJ/mol, 22.50±7.26kJ/mol and 15.22±2.75kJ/mol, respectively. The kinetic parameters evidence a higher thermal stability of carotenoids and polyphenols, suggesting higher degradation rates for flavonoids and antioxidant activity. Our results demonstrate that industrial process optimization in terms of time-temperature combinations demands product specific kinetic data.",

      "abstract": "Sea buckthorn has long been used as a functional food to regulate cholesterol, relieve angina, and diminish inflammation. Flavonoids are one of the main active components in sea buckthorn. We investigated the effects of sea buckthorn flavonoid (SF) treatment on two pathways that mediate inflammation, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathways, to explore the anti-inflammatory activity of SFs in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. The LPS-induced over-production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was inhibited by SFs through a mechanism related to the modulatory effects of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) genes. Additionally, SFs downregulated the production and mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β. Moreover, SFs inhibited the phosphorylation of the p38 and stress-activated protein kinase/jun amino-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) MAPK pathways, and they reduced the nuclear translocation of NF-κB to prevent its activation by blocking the phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitor protein of NF-κB α (IκB-α). Based on these findings, SFs may exert their inhibitory effects on inflammation by regulating the release of inflammatory mediators through the MAPK and NF-κB pathways. SFs highlight the potential benefits of using functional foods with anti-inflammatory actions to combat inflammatory diseases.",

However, the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. The present study examined whether SBT leaf extract could inhibit proliferation and promote apoptosis of rat glioma C6 cells. The results revealed that the treatment with SBT leaf extract inhibited proliferation of rat C6 glioma cells in a dose-dependent manner. SBT-induced reduction of C6 glioma cell proliferation and viability was accompanied by a decrease in production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are critical for the proliferation of tumor cells. SBT treatment not only significantly upregulated the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) but also promoted its localization in the nucleus. Although increased expression and nuclear translocation of Bax were observed in SBT-treated C6 glioma cells, the induced nuclear morphological change was distinct from that of typical apoptotic cells in that most of SBT-treated cells were characterized by convoluted nuclei with cavitations and clumps of chromatin. All of these results suggest that SBT leaf extract could inhibit the rapid proliferation of rat C6 glioma cells, possibly by inducing the early events of apoptosis. Thus, SBT may serve as a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of glioma.",

      "abstract": "Sea buckthorn fruit oil is rich in palmitoleic acid (POA), which has been reported to play roles in many metabolic processes. In this study, a sea buckthorn fruit oil (SBFO) extract was evaluated through in vitro experiments (the doses were 50, 100, 200, and 400 μM) and in vivo experiments (the doses were 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg·day) to explore its mechanism of action in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The results revealed that the SBFO extract effectively increased the glucose uptake from 12.23 ± 1.09 to 14.90 ± 1.48 mmol/L in insulin resistance (IR) HepG2 cells, lowered blood glucose (the reductions rates of blood glucose in groups treated with SBFO extract at 200 and 300 mg/kg·day were 10.47% and 13.79%, respectively) and improved insulin indices from -6.11 ± 0.10 to -5.45 ± 0.31 after 4 weeks treatment with SBFO extract at 300 mg/kg·day in T2DM SD rats. RT-PCR and Western blotting analyses suggested that the SBFO extract could promote the expression of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and glycogen synthesis (GS) while inhibiting the expression of glycogen synthesis kinase-3β (GSK-3β). Thus, the SBFO extract played a positive role in alleviating T2DM through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in HepG2 cells, and diabetic rats and could be used for the future development of functional food and dietary supplements.",

The aim of the present study is to investigate the potential of a mixture of sea buckthorn and St. John's wort oils (HrHp oil) in the treatment of endometriosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The activity was assessed in surgically induced endometriosis in rats. A 15-mm piece of endometrium was sutured into the abdominal wall. Twenty-eight days later, a second laparotomy was performed to calculate the endometrial foci areas and to score intra-abdominal adhesions. The rats were treated with either vehicle, HrHp oil formulation, or the reference (buserelin acetate). At the end of the experiment all rats were sacrificed and endometriotic foci areas and intra-abdominal adhesions were re-evaluated. The tissue sections were analyzed histopathologically. Peritoneal fluids of the experimental animals were collected in order to detect the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, vascular endothelial growth factor, and interleukin-6, which might be involved in the etiology of endometriosis. RESULTS: In the HrHp oil-treated group, the volumes of endometriotic implants were found to be significantly decreased (from 50.8 mm3 to 18.6 mm3, p<0.001) without any adhesion (0.0±0.0, p<0.001) when compared to the control group (3.1±0.9). The levels of tumor necrosis factor-α decreased from 7.02±1.33 pg/mL to 4.78±1.02 pg/mL (p<0.01); vascular endothelial growth factor from 17.39±8.52 pg/mL to 9.67±5.04 pg/mL (p<0.01); and interleukin-6 from 50.95±22.84 pg/mL to 29.11±7.45 pg/mL (p<0.01), respectively, after HrHp oil treatment. CONCLUSION: HrHp oil may be a promising alternative for the treatment of endometriosis.",

      "abstract": "Sea buckthorn has gained importance as a versatile nutraceutical, due to its high nutritive value in terms of carotenoids content. β-Lactoglobulin (β-LG) is a natural carrier for various bioactive compounds. In this study, the effect of thermal treatment in the temperature range of 25 to 100°C for 15min on the complex formed by β-LG and carotenoids from sea buckthorn was reported, based on fluorescence spectroscopy, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation results. Also, the berries extracts were analyzed for their carotenoids content. The chromatographic profile of the sea buckthorn extracts revealed the presence of zeaxanthin and β-carotene, as major compounds. The Stern-Volmer constants and binding parameters between β-LG and β-carotene were estimated based on quenching experiments. When thermally treating the β-LG-carotenoids mixtures, an increase in intrinsic and extrinsic fluorescence intensity up to 90°C was observed, together with blue-shifts in maximum emission in the lower temperature range and red-shifts at higher temperature. Based on fluorescence spectroscopy results, the unfolding of the protein molecules at high temperature was suggested. Detailed information obtained at atomic level revealed that events taking place in the complex heated at high temperature caused important changes in the β-carotene binding site, therefore leading to a more thermodynamically stable assembly. This study can be used to understand the changes occurring at molecular level that could help food operators to design new ingredients and functional foods, and to optimize the processing methods in order to obtain healthier food products.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An experiment was conducted for 60 days. 36 adult male Wistar rats with a mean body weight of 177.8±12.6 g were divided into five groups and were subjected to various daily oral treatment regimens. Group I served as a negative control receiving only feed and water, Group II (positive control for lead) received lead acetate at 250 ppm in drinking water, and Group III (positive control for SLE) received SLE at 100 mg/kg b.wt. Animals in Group IV received a combination of lead acetate at 250 ppm in drinking water for the first 45 days and SLE at 100 mg/kg b.wt. throughout the experimental period of 60-day, and in Group V for the last 15 days of the trial after the administration of lead acetate until the first 45 days of the trial to study the protective and ameliorating effects of SLE, respectively. Blood samples were collected from retro-orbital fossa of each rat on 0th, 45th, and 60th day of the experiment for hemato-biochemical analysis including hemoglobin (Hb), packed cell volume (PCV), serum total protein, albumin, globulin, albumin:globulin ratio, cholesterol, urea, and creatinine. RESULTS: Significantly (p<0.01) lower levels of serum total proteins and albumin, and a significantly (p<0.01) higher serum cholesterol, urea and creatinine levels were observed in Group II (lead intoxicated group) in comparison to Group I (negative control). Administration of SLE at 100 mg/kg body wt. to lead intoxicated Wistar rats resulted in normalization of almost all the biochemical parameters studied in both the treatment Groups, i.e., IV and V (protective and ameliorative). However, the effects were more pronounced in the protective group. No effects of SLE supplementation were observed on Hb levels. PCV levels improved in protective groups, but no effect was observed in ameliorative group in comparison to lead intoxicated groups. CONCLUSION: SLE administration at 100 mg/kg b.wt. to lead intoxicated Wistar rats may be used to protect/ameliorate lead induced biochemical alterations in Wistar rats."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Vaccines and antiviral drugs are the most widely used methods of preventing or treating Influenza virus infection. The role of sea buckthorn (SBT) bud dry extract as a natural antiviral drug against Influenza was investigated. METHODS: Influenza virus was cultured in the MDCK cell line, with or without SBT bud extract, and virus growth was assessed by HA and TCID50 virus titration in terms of cytopathic effect on cells. Several concentrations of extract were tested, the virus titer being measured on day 4 after infection. RESULTS: After infection, the virus titer in the control sample was calculated to be 2.5 TCID50/ml; treatment with SBT bud extract reduced the virus titer to 2.0 TCID50/ml at 50 μg/ml, while the HA titer was reduced from 1431 (control) to 178. Concentrations lower than 50μg/ml displayed an inhibitory effect in the HA assay, but not in the TCID50 virus titration; however, observation of the viral cultures confirmed a slowdown of viral growth at all concentrations. DISCUSSION: Natural dietary supplements and phytotherapy are a growing market and offer new opportunities for the treatment of several diseases and disorders. These preliminary experiments are the first to show that SBT bud extract is able to reduce the growth of the Influenza A H1N1 virus in vitro at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. This discovery opens up the possibility of using SBT bud extract as a valid weapon against Influenza and, in addition, as the starting-point for the discovery of new drugs."

Study with 9-week-old inbred male Swiss albino Strain 'A' mice demonstrated that SBL-1 treatment before (60)Co-gamma-irradiation (10 Gy) significantly (p < 0.05) countered radiation induced decreases in jejunum crypts (1.27-fold), villi number (1.41-fold), villus height (1.25-fold), villus cellularity (2.27-fold), cryptal Paneth cells (1.89-fold), and Bcl2 level (1.54-fold). It countered radiation induced increases in cryptal apoptotic cells (1.64-fold) and Bax levels (1.88-fold). It also countered radiation (2 Gy and 3 Gy) induced bone marrow apoptosis (1.59-fold and 1.85-fold) and micronuclei frequency (1.72-fold and 2.6-fold). SBL-1 rendered radiation protection by promoting cryptal stem cells proliferation, by regulating apoptosis, and by countering radiation induced chromosomal damage. Quercetin, Ellagic acid, Gallic acid, high contents polyphenols, tannins, and thiols detected in SBL-1 may have contributed to radiation protection by neutralization of radiation induced oxidative species, supporting stem cell proliferation and tissue regeneration."

      "abstract": "Depression is one of the prevalent and serious mental disorders and the number of depressed patients has been on the rise globally during the recent decades. Sea buckthorn seed oil from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is edible and has been widely used for treatment of different diseases for a long time. However, there are few published reports on the antidepressant effect of sea buckthorn seed oil. With the objective of finding potential biomarkers of the therapeutic response of sea buckthorn seed oil in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rats, urine metabolomics based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) coupled with multivariate analysis was applied. In this study, we discovered a higher level of pimelic acid as well as palmitic acid and a lower level of suberic acid, citrate, phthalic acid, cinnamic acid and Sumiki's acid in urine of rats exposed to CUMS procedures after sea buckthorn seed oil was administered. These changes of metabolites are involved in energy metabolism, fatty acid metabolism and other metabolic pathways as well as in the synthesis of neurotransmitters and it is helpful to facilitate the efficacy evaluation and mechanism elucidating the effect of sea buckthorn seed oil for depression management.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vaginal atrophy, the thinning and drying of vaginal mucosa, is associated with menopause. The standard estrogen treatment is not suitable for all women. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of oral sea buckthorn (SB) oil supplementation on vaginal atrophy. METHOD: A total of 116 postmenopausal women experiencing symptoms of vaginal dryness, itching or burning were randomized to this placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Ninety-eight participants completed the intervention of three months, during which they consumed 3g of SB or placebo oil daily. At the beginning and end, factors of vaginal health were scored by a gynecologist, vaginal pH and moisture were measured and vaginal health index was calculated. Symptoms of atrophy and menopause were evaluated at study visits and by daily logbooks. Serum samples were collected for the analysis of circulating lipids, liver enzymes and C-reactive protein. RESULTS: Compared to placebo, there was a significantly better rate of improvement in the integrity of vaginal epithelium in the SB group when both compliant and noncompliant participants were included (odds ratio (OR)=3.1, 95% CI 1.11-8.95). A beneficial trend was observed when only the compliant participants were included (OR=2.9; 95% CI 0.99-8.35). There was a tendency (P=0.08) toward better improvement of vaginal health index from baseline to the end in the SB group [(0.8 (SD 2.8)] compared to placebo [-0.1 (SD 2.0)]. CONCLUSIONS: SB oil showed beneficial effects on vaginal health, indicating it is a potential alternative for mucosal integrity for those women not able to use estrogen treatment for vaginal atrophy.",

      "abstract": "Fatty acid synthase (FAS) is overexpressed in many human cancers including breast cancer and is considered to be a promising target for therapy. Sea buckthorn has long been used to treat a variety of maladies. Here, we investigated the inhibitory effect of sea buckthorn procyanidins (SBPs) isolated from the seeds of sea buckthorn on FAS and FAS overexpressed human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. The FAS activity and FAS inhibition were measured by a spectrophotometer at 340 nm of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) absorption. We found that SBP potently inhibited the activity of FAS with a half-inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 0.087 μg/ml. 3-4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,3-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to test the cell viability. SBP reduced MDA-MB-231 cell viability with an IC50 value of 37.5 μg/ml. Hoechst 33258/propidium iodide dual staining and flow cytometric analysis showed that SBP induced MDA-MB-231 cell apoptosis. SBP inhibited intracellular FAS activity with a dose-dependent manner. In addition, sodium palmitate could rescue the cell apoptosis induced by SBP. These results showed that SBP was a promising FAS inhibitor which could induce the apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells via inhibiting FAS. These findings suggested that SBP might be useful for preventing or treating breast cancer.",

      "abstract": "The extract of sea buckthorn (SBT) [Hippophae rhamnoides L. (Elaeagnaceae)], is used as a food supplement and traditional medicine in numerous countries. This study investigated the protective effects of the functional extract of SBT against paraquat (PQ)-induced toxicity via antioxidant mechanisms in A549 cells. The methanol extract of SBT (25-200 µg/ml) was used to protect cells against PQ (200 µM)-induced cell death. A viability assay was conducted using 3-(4,5-dimethylthioazol-2-ly)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Total intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured and plotted. For validation of the SBT-induced expression of nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its target genes, western blot analysis and qPCR were performed. The present study showed that pretreatment of A549 cells with SBT extract significantly attenuated PQ (200 µM)-induced cellular toxicity. The maximum cytoprotective effect was identified using 200 µg/ml SBT extract; it began 24 h following exposure and was sustained up to 120 h (P<0.05). SBT extract significantly reduced LDH activity by 35.63% and ROS levels by 30.90% (P<0.05). Pretreatment with SBT extract activated Nrf2 mRNA and protein expression and its nuclear translocation. The SBT extract effectively induced Nrf2 target genes, such as NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone 1, glutathione peroxidase 1, glutathione reductase and catalase following treatment with PQ. Based on these results, it was hypothesized that SBT extract may be used as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of various oxidative stress-related diseases.",
