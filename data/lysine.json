      "abstract": "As some of the most promising candidates available, fullerene-derived bioactive agents have been explored as new drugs with high efficacy and safety for biomedical applications. In this study, a fullerene-lysine derivative (C60-Lys) was synthesized successfully and proved to be good at treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). C60-Lys could alleviate oxidative stress both in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced MIN6 cells and in STZ-induced T2DM mice subjected to a high-fat diet, and it significantly normalized glucose uptake and reduced blood glucose. In addition, C60-Lys can alleviate insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia and lipid levels in T2DM mice. It was further confirmed that C60-Lys could alleviate oxidative stress by increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes and stabilizing the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) of pancreatic β-cells to reduce the overproduction of ROS. The results provide compelling evidence that C60-Lys possesses promising applications for T2DM treatment."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the intrinsic relationships between meat quality, protein properties, and enzyme activities of pork longissimus dorsi treated with L-lysine (Lys) during postmortem aging. METHODS: The pork was obtained from 18 twelve-month-old crossbred pigs (120 kg, Duroc × Long White Large × White, longissimus dorsi muscle) in three batches of six samples each. The meat was then immediately placed in a thermal container and transported to the laboratory within 1 hour for subsequent processing at 4 ℃. After removing fat and connective tissue, the pork was cut into 20 g ± 1 g meat blocks. Then, the samples were vacuum sealed and left in a freezer (4 ℃) for 0, 1 and 3 days. RESULTS: The results indicated that Lys addition (0.10%, 0.15%, and 0.20%) could improve pork quality (water-holding capacity and tenderness). On the third day of aging, the shear force values reached their lowest levels (P < 0.05), measuring 38.21 N, 34.04 N, and 30.94 N for the respective treatment groups. In addition, the postmortem addition of Lys significantly increased the myofibrillar fragmentation index and actomyosin solubility during pork aging (P < 0.05), with maximum values of 105.07 and 90.35%, respectively. Meanwhile, microscopic structure and electrophoresis results indicated that Lys treatment disrupted the muscle fiber structure, promoted the degradation of MPs (myofibrillar proteins) and dissociation of actomyosin. Furthermore, with increasing Lys addition, calpain-1 activity, caspase-3 activity, and Ca2+-ATPase activity in the muscle significantly increased (P < 0.05), reaching maximum values of 17.46 ng/mL, 55.68 µg/mL, and 2.79 μmol (Pi)/min·mg protein, respectively. The activation of these enzymes promoted the dissociation and hydrolysis of key structural proteins. CONCLUSION: Lys improved pork quality by activating calpain-1, caspase-3, and Ca2+-ATPase activity during the postmortem aging, thereby promoting the degradation of MPs and the dissociation of the actomyosin."

      "abstract": "Endoscopic investigations reveal that a significant majority of individuals taking NSAIDs exhibit acute hemorrhages and mucosal erosions within the gastroduodenal lining. Ketoprofen acid (KA) is a potent NSAID with established efficacy and cardiovascular tolerability, but its gastric tolerability is a recognized limitation. To mitigate this, ketoprofen lysine salt (KLS) was developed. This review evaluates the pharmacological advantages of KLS over KA. While both KA and KLS maintain similar potency, KLS offers distinct advantages. Firstly, KLS demonstrates superior gastrointestinal protection through enhanced antioxidant properties and upregulation of mucosal defenses, as evidenced by both in vitro and in vivo studies. Secondly, KLS exhibits significantly faster absorption, leading to a more rapid onset of analgesic effects; this is attributed to its increased solubility and faster achievement of therapeutic concentrations. In essence, KLS addresses the gastric tolerability issues of KA while providing a quicker onset of action, making it a valuable alternative for patients requiring NSAID therapy, particularly those with gastric sensitivities or in need of rapid pain relief."

Methods for their site-specific modification offer immense potential for enhancing their therapeutic applications, but established approaches, such as fusion proteins, have well-known limitations in the nanobody format. Here, we report a convenient and broadly applicable method for site-specifically functionalizing a single residue near the C-terminus of VHH nanobodies by employing lysine acylation using conjugating enzymes (LACE) to transfer short peptides bearing functional group handles for potassium acyltrifluoroborate (KAT) ligations onto a single lysine residue of the expressed nanobodies. This approach requires a LACE tag (4 residues or 11 residues) in the recombinant nanobodies and enables direct elaboration of the products via a rapid amide forming reaction. In this study, VHH nanobodies expressed in Escherichia coli could be efficiently modified through the transfer of specific chemical handles, enabling their conjugation to small molecules, nanobodies, and antibodies by chemoselective, amide-forming KAT ligations that operate at micromolar concentrations."

A total of 384 one-day-old male White Pekin ducklings were allocated to six different dietary treatments, each containing varying levels of digestible Lys content ranging from 0.72% to 1.12%. All amino acids in the diets remained consistent except for Lys. The ducklings were randomly distributed into 24-floor pens, with each treatment group comprising eight pens, and each pen housing eight ducklings. The diets were offered ad-libitum throughout the study. Weekly measurements of body weight and feed intake were recorded to calculate the feed conversion ratio. The SID Lys requirement was determined by analyzing the data using both linear-plateau and quadratic-plateau models and calculating the mean value. The results demonstrated a significant linear (p < 0.001) and quadratic (p < 0.001) improvement in body weight gain and feed efficiency with increasing SID Lys content in the diet. According to the linear-plateau regression analysis, the estimated SID Lys requirements for final body weight, weight gain, and feed efficiency were 1.00%, 1.00%, and 0.98%, respectively. Conversely, the quadratic-plateau regression analysis yielded estimated SID Lys requirements of 1.11%, 1.11%, and 1.10%, respectively, for the same parameters. In summary, this study established that the recommended SID Lys levels for White Pekin ducklings for the 3 wk period after hatching were found to be 1.05%, 1.05%, and 1.04% for achieving the finest final body weight, daily gain, and feed efficiency, respectively."

      "abstract": "Oncolytic virotherapy, which uses engineered viruses to selectively target tumour cells, has emerged as a potential treatment in glioma. However, how oncolytic virus infection modulates lactylation enzymes in gliomas remains unclear. The RNA-seq data after oncolytic virus EV-A71 infection on glioma cells was analysed to screen and lysine acetyltransferase 8 (KAT8) was selected. We analysed KAT8 expression in glioma tissues using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases. Associations between KAT8 expression and clinicopathological features were evaluated. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression models were used to assess the prognostic value of KAT8. Functional annotation analyses were performed to explore the KAT8-related biological processes. Single-cell RNA-sequencing data were analysed to investigate cell-type-specific KAT8 expression. In vitro experiments were conducted to validate the effects of KAT8 knockdown on apoptosis in glioma cells. KAT8 was among the top 5 down-regulated genes in glioma cells after oncolytic viruses EV-A71 infection. KAT8 was significantly overexpressed in glioma tissues compared to normal brain tissues, with higher expression in lower-grade gliomas. High KAT8 expression was associated with 1p19q co-deletion, IDH mutation, and younger patient age. Notably, high KAT8 expression correlated with better overall survival in grade IV gliomas. Functional analyses revealed KAT8's involvement in neuronal development, mRNA processing, and apoptosis regulation. Single-cell sequencing data revealed a negative correlation between KAT8 expression and apoptosis in glioblastoma cells. In vitro experiments confirmed the increased apoptosis in glioma cell lines following KAT8 knockdown. Our findings suggest that the regulatory pathway of oncolytic virus infection for lactylation enzymes may be a key pathway affecting gliomas. These findings highlight KAT8 as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for gliomas.",

      "abstract": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) progresses from preneoplastic precursors via genetic and epigenetic alterations. Previous studies have focused on the treatment of terminally developed OSCC. However, the role of epigenetic regulators as therapeutic targets during the transition from preneoplastic precursors to OSCC has not been well studied. Our study identified lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) as a crucial promoter of OSCC, demonstrating that its knockout or pharmacological inhibition in mice reversed OSCC preneoplasia. LSD1 inhibition by SP2509 disrupted cell cycle, reduced immunosuppression, and enhanced CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell infiltration. In a feline model of spontaneous OSCC, a clinical LSD1 inhibitor (Seclidemstat or SP2577) was found to be safe and effectively inhibit the STAT3 network. Mechanistic studies revealed that LSD1 drives OSCC progression through STAT3 signaling, which is regulated by phosphorylation of the cell cycle mediator CDK7 and immunosuppressive CTLA4. Notably, LSD1 inhibition reduced the phosphorylation of CDK7 at Tyr170 and eIF4B at Ser422, offering insights into a novel mechanism by which LSD1 regulates the preneoplastic-to-OSCC transition. This study provides a deeper understanding of OSCC progression and highlights LSD1 as a potential therapeutic target for controlling OSCC progression from preneoplastic lesions.",

SIRT7 is associated with aging and a number of age-related diseases, but the enzymatic properties of SIRT7 are largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the biochemical activity of SIRT7 by performing a series of in vitro kinetic studies in the presence of different acyl substrates. The binding affinity of SIRT7 for NAD+ was dependent on the acyl substrate, and SIRT7 showed a preference for depropionylation and demyristoylation. Nicotinamide, the end-product of the sirtuin reaction, inhibits the activity of SIRT1-6. We also found that the sensitivity of SIRT7 to nicotinamide inhibition also depended on the chain length of the acylated peptides and that nicotinamide was a poor inhibitor of SIRT7 with non-acetylated substrates. These findings may provide insights into the development of novel SIRT7 modulators for the treatment of age-related diseases.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin condition, affecting 15%-20% of children and up to 10% of adults. It has a significant impact on patients' quality of life and represents a considerable burden on healthcare systems. Management strategies aim to restore the skin barrier, reduce inflammation, and achieve physiological and homeostatic balance. This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of a new dermocosmetic formulation combining poly-l-lysine biovectors with vitamins A and C. METHODS: A single-arm, open-label study was conducted on 20 patients diagnosed with AD, including 14 women and 6 men aged between 24 and 63, with skin phototypes of Fitzpatrick I-VI. Treatment involved sequential application of poly-l-lysine G2/vitamin C in the morning and poly-l-lysine G3/vitamin A in the evening for 28 days, on the face, hands, and body. Outcomes were assessed using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and SCORAD scores. Additional assessments included a visual analog scale for pruritus and sleep disturbance, as well as patient self-report questionnaires on skin improvement and treatment satisfaction. RESULTS: The treatment was well-tolerated, with no adverse effects and no relapses of AD. After 28 days, patients showed a significant reduction in DLQI (-61.8%, Cohen's d = 1.20) and SCORAD (-41.8%, Cohen's d = 1.05) scores. Objective improvements included reductions in erythema (-50%), dryness (-60%), and pruritus (-50%). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the potential of poly-l-lysine-based dermocosmetics combined with vitamins A and C to improve the symptoms and quality of life of patients suffering from AD. The formulations were well-tolerated and effective in restoring the skin barrier and reducing inflammation. Further large-scale controlled studies are needed to validate these results and explore long-term efficacy."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen capable of causing superficial mucosal and systemic infections, sometimes leading to life-threatening conditions. The increasing resistance of C. albicans to azole antifungals has become a significant challenge in clinical treatment. Lysine acetylation (KAc) is a well-studied post-translational modification that plays crucial roles in various biological processes. However, its impact on antifungal resistance in C. albicans remains poorly understood. Five strains of C. albicans isolated from the same patient, representing different stages of acquired fluconazole resistance in vivo, were used in this study to investigate the potential regulatory mechanism of KAc on the development of azole resistance in C. albicans. Quantitative proteomic analysis using tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling, acetylation enrichment, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was conducted on these five strains. We divided all strains into four comparison groups and identified a total of 1,796 lysine acetylation sites across 938 proteins, with quantitative data available for 1,314 acetylation sites in 712 proteins. Analysis of 155 significantly differentially modified sites revealed that the acetylation levels of key proteins involved in the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA for entry into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for energy production were initially decreased and then increased during the acquisition of fluconazole resistance. Additionally, the acetylation levels of proteins involved in ribosome synthesis, translation processes, and amino acid synthesis were found to increase. Therefore, lysine acetylation in C. albicans may contribute to azole resistance by regulating energy metabolism and protein synthesis. I: Candida albicans, an opportunistic fungal pathogen, presents significant clinical challenges due to its escalating resistance to azole antifungals, especially fluconazole. This study investigates the role of lysine acetylation in the development of azole resistance using multiple strains isolated from a single patient with varying resistance levels. Through advanced proteomic analysis, we identified numerous lysine acetylation sites on proteins involved in key metabolic pathways. The results revealed a dynamic change in the acetylation of proteins related to energy metabolism - specifically, those connecting pyruvate to the tricarboxylic acid cycle-which correlated with the evolution of resistance. Additionally, increased acetylation was observed in proteins linked to ribosome synthesis and translation processes. These findings suggest that lysine acetylation is crucial for regulating metabolic and protein synthesis pathways, potentially influencing azole resistance in C. albicans."

Developing high-quality diets that ensure positive feed perception by birds is a key strategy for enhancing production performance within the industry. This study evaluated the effect of crude protein (CP) and four essential amino acid (AA) reductions on broiler chickens' growth performance and taste sensitivity for Lysine, Methionine, Threonine, and Tryptophan. Sixty-four one-day-old male broiler chickens (Ross 308) were exposed to four dietary treatments consisting of a balanced (control) diet with a total inclusion of CP and Lysine, Methionine, Threonine, and Tryptophan (T1); diets with a 30 g/kg reduction in CP maintaining 100% exogenous incorporation of the four aforementioned AAs (T2); diets with a 30 g/kg reduction in CP and 50% exogenous incorporation of the same four AAs (T3); and diets with a 30 g/kg reduction in CP with no exogenous incorporation of the four previously mentioned AAs (T4). After 7 days of acclimatization to the diets, the birds were offered Lysine, Methionine, Threonine, and Tryptophan at eight concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5%) each for 4 h/day in a double-choice test for 32 days to determine the preferences and sensory-motivated intake (SMI) of the birds. During the 39-day trial, the birds in the T4 group showed a lower (p < 0.050) average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily gain (ADG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), and body weight (BW) than the birds of the rest of the treatments. No significant effects of the different dietary treatments, CP content, or AA levels were observed on the preferences or SMI of the birds (p > 0.050). However, differences were found in the preferences and SMI between birds from the different treatments when evaluating the treatment × AA × concentration interaction (p < 0.050), reflecting that dietary treatments generate changes in the consumption behavior of birds in response to the delivery of AAs at different concentrations. The preference and SMI thresholds for Lysine decreased in the birds in the T4 group, while the thresholds for Methionine and Tryptophan increased compared to the birds in the control group (p < 0.050). We concluded that the reduction in CP and AAs in the diet of broiler chickens affects their productive parameters and increases their taste sensitivity, which was reflected in lower weight gain and feed conversion efficiency, along with increased preferences and higher SMI values in the birds exposed to diets with more significant nutritional deficits."

Lysine lactylation is a recently identified post-translational modification that serves as an intracellular mechanism of lactate sensing and transfer. Although acetyltransferases such as p300 exhibit general acyl transfer activity, no bona fide lactyltransferases have been identified. Recently, the protein synthesis machinery, alanyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (AARS1), AARS2 and their Escherichia coli orthologue AlaRS, have been shown to be able to sense lactate and mediate lactyl transfer and are thus considered pan-lactyltransferases. Here we highlight the mechanisms and functions of these lactyltransferases and discuss potential strategies that could be exploited for the treatment of human diseases.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Chondrocyte metabolic dysfunction plays an important role in osteoarthritis (OA) development during aging and obesity. Protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) have recently emerged as an important regulator of cellular metabolism. We aim to study one type of PTM, lysine malonylation (MaK) and its regulator Sirt5 in OA development. METHODS: Human and mouse cartilage tissues were used to measure SIRT5 and MaK levels. Both systemic and cartilage-specific conditional knockout mouse models were subject to high-fat diet (HFD) treatment to induce obesity and OA. Proteomics analysis was performed in Sirt5-/- and WT chondrocytes. SIRT5 mutation was identified in the Utah Population Database (UPDB). RESULTS: We found that SIRT5 decreases while MAK increases in the cartilage during aging. A combination of Sirt5 deficiency and obesity exacerbates joint degeneration in a sex dependent manner in mice. We further delineate the malonylome in chondrocytes, pinpointing MaK's predominant impact on various metabolic pathways such as carbon metabolism and glycolysis. Lastly, we identified a rare coding mutation in SIRT5 that dominantly segregates in a family with OA. The mutation results in substitution of an evolutionally invariant phenylalanine (Phe-F) to leucine (Leu-L) (F101L) in the catalytic domain. The mutant protein results in higher MaK level and decreased expression of cartilage ECM genes and upregulation of inflammation associated genes. CONCLUSIONS: We found that Sirt5 mediated MaK is an important regulator of chondrocyte cellular metabolism and dysregulation of Sirt5-MaK could be an important mechanism underlying aging and obesity associated OA development."

      "abstract": "Recent advances in cancer therapy have underscored the importance of targeting specific metabolic pathways. In this study, we propose a precision nutrition approach aimed at lysosomal function in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Using patient-derived GBM cells, we identify lysosomal activity as a unique metabolic biomarker of tumorigenesis, controlling the efficacy of temozolomide (TMZ), a standard GBM therapy. Employing combined analyses of clinical patient samples and xenograft models, we further elucidate the pivotal role of Transcription Factor Binding To IGHM Enhancer 3 (TFE3), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, in modulating malignant properties, particularly TMZ tolerance, by regulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α)-mediated mitochondrial activity. Notably, we find that lysine protects GBM cells from lysosomal stress by counteracting arginine's effects on nitric oxide production. The lysine restriction mimetic, homoarginine administration, significantly enhances the efficacy of anticancer therapies through lysosomal dysfunction. This study underscores the critical role of lysosomal function modulated by amino acid metabolism in GBM pathogenesis and treatment.",

      "abstract": "Developing cancer therapies that induce robust death of the malignant cell is critical to prevent relapse. Highly effective strategies, such as immunotherapy, exemplify this observation. Here we provide the structural and molecular underpinnings for an approach that leverages chemical induced proximity to produce specific cell killing of diffuse large B cell lymphoma, the most common non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We develop KAT-TCIPs (lysine acetyltransferase transcriptional/epigenetic chemical inducers of proximity) that redirect p300 and CBP to activate programmed cell death genes normally repressed by the oncogenic driver, BCL6. Acute treatment rapidly reprograms the epigenome to initiate apoptosis and repress c-MYC. The crystal structure of the chemically induced p300-BCL6 complex reveals how chance interactions between the two proteins can be systematically exploited to produce the exquisite potency and selectivity of KAT-TCIPs. Thus, the malignant function of an oncogenic driver can be co-opted to activate robust cell death, with implications for precision epigenetic therapies."

The wound-healing activity of DHQ is well-known. The addition of amino acid to the composition increases the water solubility of the flavonoids, providing an opportunity to develop a spray dosage form. The research involved 60 male Wistar rats divided into five treatment groups. Sea buck oil served as a positive control. On day 14, the composition treatment group showed significant progress in wound healing, being 9.6 ± 2.0% ahead of the other groups in absolute terms. On day 35, treatment with the composition resulted in a significant decrease in relative wound area to 1.9 ± 0.9%, while in the negative and positive control groups, it was 10.7 ± 7.8% and 8.4 ± 4.9%, respectively. At the same time, the epidermal and dermal layers were found to be clearly distinguished in the composition treatment according to histological analysis. Numerous collagen fibres were clearly visible, and the active process of keloid scar formation was observed. An additive effect of the combined use of DHQ and L-lysine was observed (F = 0.21, p = 0.649). A natural next step is to develop the dosage form for the DHQ-L-lysine composition.",

Acetylation is a post-translational modification used to regulate protein function at the end of protein synthesis. In this study, we found that acetylated human serum albumin (Ac-HSA) acts an uptake ligand on CD44 receptors. This promising finding motivated us to develop an Ac-HSA-based nanocarrier for cancer chemotherapy. By conjugating maleimide-polylactic acid (MAL-PLA) with Ac-HSA, the resulting amphiphile formed nanoparticles (Ac-HSA-PLA NPs) which were shown to rapidly enter CD44+ cancer cells and cancer stem cells via CD44-mediated endocytosis. This contrasts with the comparatively slow uptake of CD44 antibodies. Abraxane®, an approved human serum albumin (HSA) nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel (PTX) demonstrates that PTX may be delivered by HSA nanoparticles. However, Abraxane® is not clinically superior to solvent-based PTX formulations. In a CD44+ tumor model, PTX-loaded Ac-HSA-PLA NPs outperformed Abraxane®, achieving complete tumor elimination without recurrence, two months post-treatment, while Abraxane treated tumors continued to grow (tumor volume increased five fold). The Ac-HSA-PLA (PTX) NPs also demonstrated minimal systemic toxicity, suggesting that Ac-HSA could be a promising alternative for targeted cancer therapy in CD44-expressing cancers."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a prevalent and serious complication among individuals with diabetes, significantly compromising their visual acuity and overall quality of life. Lysine acetyltransferase 5 (KAT5), an essential catalytic subunit of the nucleosome acetyltransferase of the H4 complex, is implicated in the development of various diseases, including neurological disorders, breast cancer, and lung cancer. However, the function of KAT5 in DR remains poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the influence of KAT5 on autophagy (Atg) during DR. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Experiments were conducted using streptozotocin (STZ)-treated rats to induce diabetes and observe changes in KAT5 expression and its effect on Atg. Retinal tissues and RF/6A cells were utilized to analyze the expression levels of various proteins and their involvement in Atg and apoptosis. KAT5 depletion and Atg7 knockdown were performed to further understand their roles in the process. RESULTS: The eyeballs of STZ-treated rats showed increased expression of KAT5. Depletion of KAT5 attenuated STZ-induced DR injury in rats. The retinal tissues of STZ-treated rats exhibited reduced expression of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and increased levels of BCL-2-associated X protein and cleaved caspase 3, which could be reversed by KAT5 depletion. STZ treatment induced expression of Beclin-1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B in retinal tissues, and KAT5 knockdown blocked this effect. In monkey retinal choroidal endothelial ( RF/6A) cells, high glucose (HG) treatment decreased 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine-positivecells and increased terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling-positive cells, which were reversed by KAT5 depletion. KAT5 depletion also attenuated HG-induced apoptosis and Atg in RF/6A cells. Mechanistically, KAT5 depletion reduced histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation and ribonucleic acid ( RNA) polymerase II enrichment on the Atg7 promoter, leading to a decrease in the messenger RNA ( mRNA) and protein expression of Atg7. Atg7 knockdown suppressed Atg in RF/6A cells under HG conditions and reversed the effect of KAT5 depletion on cell apoptosis and Atg. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that KAT5 contributes to DR by modulating Atg through epigenetic regulation of Atg7. KAT5 emerges as a valuable target for DR treatment, providing a fresh perspective on the disease's pathogenesis and laying the foundation for the development of potential therapeutic strategies."

      "abstract": "Abnormal amino acid metabolism supports cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and immune evasion in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Previous research exploring amino acid metabolism in HCC has primarily focused on how metabolic reprogramming impacts tumor cells. Here, we focused on the role of amino acid metabolism dysregulation in the crosstalk between HCC and T cells. HCC cells disrupted lysine uptake in T cells, leading to impaired T cell immunity. Lysine deprivation decreased STAT3 levels in T cells, inhibiting T cell proliferation and effector function and ultimately promoting tumor progression. Mechanistically, HCC cells outcompeted T cells for lysine by expressing high levels of the lysine transporter SLC3A2. Clinically, elevated SLC3A2 expression correlated with poor survival and was linked to dysregulated T cell functional gene signatures in HCC patients. Furthermore, the multikinase inhibitor lenvatinib induced a c-Myc-SLC3A2 regulatory axis that limited the efficacy of lenvatinib treatment. Lysine supplementation enhanced tumor sensitivity to combined treatment with lenvatinib and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. These findings suggest that lysine supplementation is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating HCC and enhancing the sensitivity of HCC to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint blockade."

      "abstract": "Environmental exposure is one driving factor of chronic kidney disease (CKD), yet the intrinsic molecular mechanisms are largely unexplored. As a persistent chemical, perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) is regulated due to a great potential to induce multiple diseases, including renal fibrosis, a major pathological characteristic of CKD. It is hypothesized that sodium p-perfluorous nonenoxybenzenesulfonate (OBS), a typical alternative to PFOS, may also induce renal fibrosis. We observed distinct renal fibrosis in mice exposed to OBS. Metabolomics analysis showed that Nα-acetyllysine was the primary metabolite biomarker, whose level decreased greatly due to its excessive consumption by lysyloxidase (LOX). This suppressed the miR-140-5p expression, promoting upregulation of fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9), which activated the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway through fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), thereby enhancing proliferation and activation of fibroblasts. Supplement of Nα-acetyllysine upregulated miR-140-5p expression, reduced expressions of FGF9 and FGFR3, and eventually ameliorated OBS-induced renal fibrosis. Similarly, treatment with miR-140-5p agomir and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway inhibitor LY294002 attenuated OBS-induced renal fibrosis. Taken together, OBS caused renal fibrosis through the LOX-Nα-acetyllysine-miR-140-5p-FGF9-FGFR3-PI3K/Akt-Bad-Bcl-2-fibroblast axis. The results of this study reveal a specific molecular axis for OBS to induce renal fibrosis and call for concerns in supervising the application of OBS.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dietary protein level and amino acid (AA) balance are crucial determinants of animal health and productivity. Supplementing rumen-protected AAs in low-protein diets was considered as an efficient strategy to improve the growth performance of ruminants. The colon serves as a crucial conduit for nutrient metabolism during rumen-protected methionine (RPMet) and rumen-protected lysine (RPLys) supplementation, however, it has been challenging to clarify which specific microbiota and their metabolites play a pivotal role in this process. Here, we applied metagenomic and metabolomic approaches to compare the characteristic microbiome and metabolic strategies in the colon of lambs fed a control diet (CON), a low-protein diet (LP) or a LP diet supplemented with RPMet and RPLys (LR). RESULTS: The LP treatment decreased the average daily weight gain (ADG) in lambs, while the LR treatment tended to elicit a remission in ADG. The butyrate molar concentration was greater (P < 0.05), while acetate molar concentration (P < 0.05) was lower for lambs fed the LP and LR diets compared to those fed the CON diet. Moreover, the LP treatment remarkably decreased total AA concentration (P < 0.05), while LR treatment showed an improvement in the concentrations of methionine, lysine, leucine, glutamate, and tryptophan. Metagenomic insights proved that the microbial metabolic potentials referring to biosynthesis of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and AAs in the colon were remarkably altered by three dietary treatments. Metagenomic binning identified distinct microbial markers for the CON group (Alistipes spp., Phocaeicola spp., and Ruminococcus spp.), LP group (Fibrobacter spp., Prevotella spp., Ruminococcus spp., and Escherichia coli), and LR group (Akkermansia muciniphila and RUG099 spp.). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that RPMet and RPLys supplementation to the low-protein diet could enhance the microbial biosynthesis of butyrate and amino acids, enriche the beneficial bacteria in the colon, and thereby improve the growth performance of lambs."

METHODS: ε-PLL-CD-LZD was synthesized via chemical methods. The grafting rate of CD was characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance. In vitro biocompatibility was evaluated through live/dead cell staining after co-culturing with mouse embryonic osteoblast precursor cells (MC3T3-E1), human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (3T3-L1). The biofilm-enrichment capacity of ε-PLL-CD-LZD was assessed using Staphylococcus aureus biofilms through enrichment studies. Its biofilm eradication efficacy was investigated via minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination, scanning electron microscopy, and live/dead bacterial staining. A bone and joint infection model in male Sprague-Dawley rats was established to validate the antibacterial effects of ε-PLL-CD-LZD. RESULTS: In ε-PLL-CD-LZD, the average grafting rate of CD reached 9.88%. The cell viability exceeded 90% after co-culturing with three types cells. The strong biofilm enrichment capability was observed with a MIC of 2 mg/L. Scanning electron microscopy observations revealed the effective disruption of biofilm structure, indicating potent biofilm eradication capacity.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dysregulation of histone methylation-based epigenetic mechanisms leads to either transient or long-lasting transcriptomic alterations in vascular and immune cells with important consequences on atherosclerotic plaque development and stability. We hypothesized that the epigenetic enzyme SET7 lysine methyltransferase contributes to the up-regulation of NADPH oxidase (Nox) and NLRP3 inflammasome expression in atherosclerosis. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we examined human non-atherosclerotic and atherosclerotic tissue samples, apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice, and human macrophages (Mac) employing real-time PCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence microscopy, and histological techniques. Male ApoE-/- mice with established atherosclerosis were randomized to receive concomitant with the high-fat diet, 5 mg/kg (R)-PFI-2, a selective SET7 pharmacological inhibitor, or its vehicle, every other day for 4 weeks. RESULTS: The results revealed that SET7 mRNA and protein, and H3K4me1 levels were significantly elevated in human carotid atherosclerotic lesions, aorta of atherosclerotic mice, and in cultured pro-inflammatory Mac. In the atherosclerotic mice, pharmacological blockade of SET7 catalytic activity with the specific inhibitor, significantly reduced atherosclerotic plaque development, decreased the aortic up-regulation of mRNA and protein levels of Nox catalytic subunits, mitigated the formation of NT-/4HNE-protein adducts, attenuated NLRP3 gene and protein expression, and reduced pro-caspase-1 and pro-IL18 cleavage. In polarized pro-inflammatory human M1-Mac, SET7-oriented pharmacological intervention reduced the transcriptional up-regulation of Nox catalytic subunits, NLRP3, caspase-1, IL1β, and IL18, and the secretion IL1β and TNFα. Transient overexpression of SET7 in human endothelial cells enhanced mRNA levels of Nox1, Nox2, Nox4, Nox5, and p22phox. CONCLUSION: The novel results show that SET7 regulates important mechanisms leading to enhanced formation of reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory cytokines release in atherosclerosis. The data recommend SET7 as a promising target for pharmacological interventions and as supportive therapeutic strategy in atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different exogenous additives, specifically sodium tripolyphosphate and lysine, on the quality of chicken breast meat in canned assorted vegetables and diced chicken using different curing methods: static curing, ultrasonic curing, vacuum tumbling curing, and ultrasonic combined with vacuum tumbling curing. The texture, moisture mobility and distribution, microstructure, and sensory acceptability of the chicken meat were evaluated. The results showed that lysine demonstrates better water retention than sodium tripolyphosphate, combining ultrasonic and vacuum tumbling treatments with 0.2% Lys (SL-UVT) significantly enhanced the texture characteristics and reduced the cooking loss of chicken breast meat. Additionally, SL-UVT treatment improved the texture, appearance, flavor, and overall acceptability scores. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis showed that SL-UVT treatment affected water distribution and flowability, increasing the retention of less mobile water in chicken breasts. In addition, the gap between myogenic fibers increased after SL-UVT treatment, trapping more water. In conclusion, SL-UVT treatment significantly improved the tenderness and water-holding capacity of the chicken breast from both macroscopic and microscopic perspectives. This study provided a theoretical foundation for refining and optimizing canned meat processing techniques.",

In this study, we investigated the protective effects of Lysine-Proline-Valine (KPV)-an endogenous peptide derived from α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone-against oxidative damage and inflammation induced by fine PM (PM10) in human HaCaT keratinocytes. Our results show that PM10 markedly suppresses HaCaT cell proliferation via cytotoxic effects and induces a pro-inflammatory response by increasing IL-1β secretion. Notably, treatment with 50 μg/mL of KPV restored cell viability and reduced IL-1β secretion disrupted by PM10 exposure. To counteract PM10-induced cell death, KPV inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which is responsible for activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Additionally, KPV decreased the expression of apoptosis-related proteins (Bax, Bcl-2, and cleaved caspase-3) and IL-1β through suppression of the redox-sensitive transcription factor nuclear, factor-kappa B in PM10-treated HaCaT cells. Against PM10-induced inflammation, KPV effectively blocked ROS-mediated caspase-1 activation, reducing IL-1β secretion. In a three-dimensional (3D) skin model, KPV treatment effectively attenuated the inflammatory cell death induced by PM10. Collectively, these findings suggest that KPV protects keratinocytes by mitigating PM10-induced pyroptosis and holds potential as a therapeutic agent for preventing environmental pollutant-related skin damage, with promising applications in functional cosmetics and skin-protective treatments."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Candida auris has emerged as a multidrug-resistant human fungal pathogen that causes infections of high morbidity and mortality. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying pronounced multidrug resistance and host-pathogen interactions are poorly understood. Here, we show that C. auris GCN5 lysine acetyltransferase is essential for cell wall remodeling, antifungal drug resistance, and virulence. The Candida albicans GCN5 has previously been shown to be an important regulator of antifungal drug resistance and virulence. Therefore, to identify Gcn5-dependent evolutionary conserved as well as divergent transcriptional networks between the two species, we performed comparative transcriptional analysis. The gene set enrichment analysis of C. auris vs C. albicans gcn5Δ transcriptomic data revealed several major biological pathways and processes including sphingolipid metabolism and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor biosynthesis to be enriched in both species. Consistent with these data, we found a prominent role for C. auris Gcn5 in maintaining cell-wall architecture, as the C. auris gcn5Δ mutant demonstrated a significant increase in cell-surface β-glucan exposure and chitin content. Additionally, we observed that Gcn5 modulates susceptibility to caspofungin and was required for fungal survival when challenged with primary murine macrophages and neutrophils ex vivo. Furthermore, disruption of GCN5 causes virulence attenuation in a murine model of disseminated candidiasis. Lastly, lysine acetyltransferase inhibitor cyclopentanone, 2-[4-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-thiazolyl] hydrazone displayed antifungal activity either alone or in combination with caspofungin against the drug-resistant C. auris wild-type strain. Collectively, these data provide new insights into the mechanisms of antifungal drug resistance and C. auris-host interactions and suggest Gcn5 lysine acetyltransferase as a potential target for antifungal therapy. IMPORTANCE: Invasive fungal diseases affect approximately 6.5 million people every year, of which about 2.5 million people die worldwide. This number is expected to rise due to increasing numbers of immunosuppressed people, including the elderly, premature infants, organ transplant recipients, cancer, and HIV/AIDS patients. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have both recently emphasized a critical need for the development of new antifungal therapeutics to address expanding drug resistance among human fungal pathogens. The necessity of new antifungal drugs is also underscored by the fact that mortality due to invasive candidiasis has remained unchanged for several decades. However, the discovery of new drugs acting on antifungal drug targets is complicated because fungi are eukaryotes. This greatly limits the number of feasible fungal-specific drug targets. One class of molecules that fulfills the criterion of fungal specificity is chromatin modification enzymes such as lysine acetyltransferase (KATs). The fungal KATs are structurally less well conserved, and some modifications are only found in fungi, minimizing the risk of toxicity, thus making KATs new promising tools for antifungal therapy. We report here that Gcn5 lysine acetyltransferase mediates antifungal drug resistance and virulence of C. auris and represents an important target for antifungal drug discovery.",

This study focuses on evaluating the expression of histone H4 lys 5 lactylation (H4K5lac) and its clinical role in breast cancer (BC). Methods During this research, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunoblotting, utilizing a specific primary anti-L-lactyl-histone H4 (Lys 5) rabbit monoclonal antibody, were employed to assess H4K5lac expression in BC tissue chips. H4K5lac expression in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of BC patients was investigated through immunoblotting. Results IHC revealed upregulation of histone H4K5lac in both triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and non-TNBC tissues, with positive rate of 91.40% [170/(150 + 19 + 17)] and 93.64% (103/110) in TNBC and non-TNBC tissues, respectively. The expression of H4K5lac demonstrated positive correlations with lymph nodes (%), and Ki-67 expression. Survival analysis indicated a negative correlation between H4K5lac expression and overall survival (OS) time in both TNBC (HR [hazard ratio] = 2.773, 95%CI [confidence interval]: 1.128-6.851, P = 0.0384) and non-TNBC cases (HR = 2.156, 95%CI: 1.011-4.599, P = 0.0275). Furthermore, elevated levels of H4K5lac were observed in the PBMCs of BC cases, and H4K5lac expression is positively correlated with serum lactate and carcinoma embryonic antigen (CEA) levels. Conclusions Histone H4K5lac exhibits increased levels in both BC tissues and PBMCs, suggesting its potential as a promising biomarker for BC. This study might pave the way toward novel lactylation treatment strategies in BC.",

Recent research shows that KDMs activate or silence downstream target genes by removing lysine residues from histone tails, and participate in the regulation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs), osteoblasts (OB), osteoclasts (OC), chondrocytes and other skeletal cell development, differentiation and formation. Moreover, several members of the KDM family affect the occurrence and development of bone diseases such as osteoporosis (OP), osteoarthritis (OA), osteosarcoma (OS), by regulating target genes. Specific regulation mechanisms of KDMs suggest new strategies for bone disease treatment and prevention. Despite the unique function and importance of KDMs in the skeletal system, previous studies have never systematically summarized their specific role, molecular mechanism, and clinical treatment in bone physiology and pathology. Therefore, this review summarises the expression pattern, intracellular signal transduction, and mechanism of action of the KDM family in several bone physiological and pathological conditions, aiming to highlight the important role of KDMs in bone diseases and provide a reference for the future treatment of bone diseases."

      "abstract": "Protein lysine lactylation is a ubiquitous and post‑translational modification of lysine residues that involves the addition of a lactyl group on both histone and non‑histone proteins. This process plays a pivotal role in human health and disease and was first discovered in 2019. This epigenetic modification regulates gene transcription from chromatin or directly influences non‑histone proteins by modulating protein‑DNA/protein interactions, activity and stability. The dual functions of lactylation in both histone and non‑histone proteins establish it as a crucial mechanism involved in various cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, immune and inflammatory responses and metabolism. Specific enzymes, referred to as 'writers' and 'erasers', catalyze the addition or removal of lactyl groups at designated lysine sites, thereby dynamically modulating lactylation through alterations in their enzymatic activities. The respiratory system has a remarkably intricate metabolic profile. Numerous pulmonary diseases feature an atypical transition towards glycolytic metabolism, which is linked to an overproduction of lactate, a possible substrate for lactylation. However, there has yet to be a comprehensive review elucidating the full impact of lactylation on the onset, progression and potential treatment of neoplastic and inflammatory pulmonary diseases. In the present review, an extensive overview of the discovery of lactylation and advancements in research on the existing lactylation sites were discussed. Furthermore, the review particularly investigated the potential roles and mechanisms of histone and non‑histone lactylation in various neoplastic and inflammatory pulmonary diseases, including non‑small cell lung cancers, malignant pleural effusion, pulmonary fibrosis, acute lung injury and asthma, to excavate the new therapeutic effects of post‑translational modification on various pulmonary diseases.",

Here, we report that vitC directly modifies lysine residues to form \"vitcyl-lysine\"-a process termed vitcylation. Vitcylation occurs in a dose-, pH-, and sequence-dependent manner in both cell-free systems and living cells. Mechanistically, vitC vitcylates signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1)- lysine-298 (K298), impairing its interaction with T cell protein-tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP) and preventing STAT1-Y701 dephosphorylation. This leads to enhanced STAT1-mediated interferon (IFN) signaling in tumor cells, increased major histocompatibility complex (MHC)/human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I expression, and activation of anti-tumor immunity in vitro and in vivo.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the dietary lysine (Lys)/ methionine (Met) ratio in a low-protein diet on short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) profiles, villus morphology, antioxidant capacity, and immune status of the jejunum in Tibetan sheep. METHODS: A total of 90 weaned Tibetan sheep, each 2 months old with an initial weight of 15.37 ± 0.92 kg, were randomly divided into three treatment groups. These groups were supplemented with different Lys/Met ratios of 3 [low protein-high methionine (LP-H)], 2 [low protein-medium methionine (LP-M)], and 1 [low protein-low methionine (LP-L)] in the basal diet (10% crude protein). The feeding trial lasted 100 days, including a 10-day acclimation period and a 90-day experimental period. RESULTS: The hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) sections showed that the LP-L group had a significantly increased villus height compared to the LP-M and LP-H groups (p < 0.05). In addition, the LP-L group showed higher levels of Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and Total Antioxidant Capacity (T-AOC) concentrations (p < 0.05). A lower concentration of Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) was observed in the LP-H group (p < 0.05). The activities of α-amylase, chymotrypsin, and lipase were higher in the LP-L group compared to the LP-H group (p < 0.05). Bacterial sequencing showed that both Chao1 and ACE richness were significantly increased in the LP-L group (p < 0.05), suggesting that the species richness in the jejunum is connected to the ratio of dietary Lys/Met. Furthermore, lowering the dietary Lys/ Met ratio significantly increased the abundance of Romboutsia, the Ruminococcus gauvreauii group, the Lachnospiraceae NK3A20 group, Ruminococcus 2, and the Christensenellaceae R-7 group (p < 0.05) while decreasing the abundance of Methanobrevibacter (p < 0.05). Several differential metabolites, including beta-alanine, pantothenate, pantothenic acid, phosphoenolpyruvate, cysteine, adenosine 5'-diphosphate, isodeoxycholic acid, glutamate conjugated cholic acid, and 3-dehydrocholic acid, were significantly increased in the LP-L group (p < 0.05). The functional analysis based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotations indicated that these metabolites were mainly involved in pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, ferroptosis, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Several genes related to barrier function, such as Occludin and Muc- 2, were upregulated in the LP-L group (p < 0.05), while IL-6 and TNF-α were downregulated (p < 0.05). DISCUSSION: Collectively, our results suggest that the dietary Met/ Lys ratio could affect the jejunal SCFA concentration by modulating the microbial community and regulating metabolism, thereby contributing to jejunal barrier function. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for the application of Lys/Met diet supplementation in the nutritional management of Tibetan sheep, particularly when reducing the dietary crude protein (CP) level."

      "abstract": "Histone lysine demethylase 5 (KDM5) is a ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase in histone lysine demethylation, playing a vital role in immunological memory by modulating H3K4me3. Investigating on the role of invertebrate KDM5 in the immune priming, a novel form of immunological memory recently verified in invertebrates, will further our knowledge of epigenetic regulation for innate immune memory. In the present study, a KDM5A was identified in Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, and its role in regulating haemocyte proliferation during immune priming was assessed. The deduced amino acid sequence of CgKDM5A harbors a complete JmjC domain featuring a conserved αKG binding site. The mRNA expression of CgKDM5A in the haemolymph was significantly higher than that in the tested tissues of the mature oysters. After Vibrio splendidus stimulation, CgKDM5A transcripts and KDM5 enzymatic activity in haemocytes significantly decreased, accompanying with increased H3K4me3 levels. Moreover, H3K4me3 modifications at the CgBMP7 and CgGATA2/3 promoters were elevated at 7 d after V. splendidus stimulation (p < 0.05), and the haemocyte proliferation index increased significantly at 12 h after the secondary stimulation (p < 0.05). Treatment with KDM5 activator DM-αKG further led to a significant increase in H3K4me3 enrichment levels at the CgBMP7 and CgGATA2/3 promoters at 7 d after the primary stimulation (p < 0.05). Subsequently, the expression of CgBMP7 and CgGATA2/3, as well as the haemocyte proliferation index decreased significantly after the secondary stimulation (p < 0.05). In contrast, CgKDM5A-RNAi oysters exhibited an enriched H3K4me3 at the CgBMP7 and CgGATA2/3 promoters at 7 d after the primary stimulation and an increased haemocyte proliferation index at 12 h after the secondary stimulation (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that CgKDM5A plays a critical role in haemocyte proliferation by affect H3K4me3 enrichment at the CgBMP7 and CgGATA2/3 promoters during immune priming in C. gigas, highlighting the potential of epigenetic regulation in innate immune memory of mollusks.",

After the bracket debonding, the residual adhesive is difficult to remove precisely due to its appearance similar to tooth enamel. In this study, we successfully synthesized small-sized and highly active PL-CDs by one-pot pyrolysis using ε-poly-l-lysine as a precursor. It was incorporated into orthodontic adhesives for multi-function modification. Based on our experimental results, the 3 wt% PL-CDs modified orthodontic adhesive exhibited excellent antibacterial properties and color identifiability. The addition of 3 wt% PL-CDs did not affect the biocompatibility and mechanical properties of the adhesive, and the cell survival rate was up to 80%. Therefore, this study provides a new strategy to solve the two major problems of enamel white spot and adhesive removal in the process of fixed orthodontics, and has important clinical application."

RDN8011 effectively degrades KDM4A-C while sparing KDM4D, and displays potent antiproliferative activity in esophageal cancer cells.

      "abstract": "This study was executed to estimate the impacts of increasing dietary standardized ileal digestible (SID) lysine and net energy levels on growth, nutrient absorption, and meat carcass traits in growing-finishing pigs. In total, 90 pigs [(Yorkshire × Landrace) × Duroc] were erratically dispensed to 3 treatments (6 replicate/treatment) with 5 pigs (3 barrows and 2 gilts) per pen, and their average primary body weight was 20.51± 0.02 kg. The trial period was 16 weeks (growing stage, initial to week 8; finishing stage, week 8 to week 16). The dietary treatments used included control (CON) as the basal diet, TRT1 (basal diet + 0.05% SID lysine), and TRT2 (basal diet + 0.05% SID lysine + 0.084 MJ/kg net energy) for both the growing and finishing stages. Both the TRT1 and TRT2 group diets improved (p = 0.033) average daily gain (ADG) at week 12 and tended to enhance (p = 0.088) body weight at week 12 and ADG at the overall period compared to the CON group. Moreover, pigs in the TRT2 group had higher backfat thickness (p = 0.034) at week 12 in comparison to the TRT1 and CON diets. Nevertheless, no treatment effect was found (p > 0.05) in nutrient absorption or carcass grade among the dietary treatments. Hence, incorporating the increasing level of 0.05% SID lysine and 0.084 MJ/kg net energy into the pig diet during the growing and finishing stages can be considered a suitable approach for enhancing both growth efficiency and carcass backfat thickness in pigs."

Bioinformatics analysis predicted that SEPP1 was low expressed in PC and related to tumor immune microenvironment, but its biological function was still unclear. METHODS: PC xenograft and liver metastasis mouse models, as well as PC cell-MDSCs co-culture system, were established for in vivo and in vitro studies, respectively. The expression and localization of key molecules were detected by qRT-PCR, western blot, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Flow cytometry was employed to assess the abundance of immune cells and cell apoptosis. The interactions among KAT8, SEPP1 and LRP8 were detected by co-IP. Cell viability, migration and invasion were monitored by CCK-8 and transwell assays. RESULTS: SEPP1 was downregulated in pancreatic tumors, and it was positively correlated with the abundance of CD8+ T cells. In vivo overexpression of SEPP1 impaired PC tumor growth and liver metastasis via modulating the abundance of CD8+ T cell and MDSCs. KAT8 upregulated SEPP1 transcription and protein level via catalyzing the acetylation at K247/249 on SEPP1, and SEPP1 impaired MDSCs survival via its receptor LRP8, thus regulating CD8+ T cell-mediated immune responses in PC. In vivo studies further revealed that SEPP1 recombinant protein enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in PC xenograft mouse model. CONCLUSION: KAT8 catalyzed the acetylation of SEPP1 at K247/249 and modulated the activity of CD8+ T cells via LRP8 to promote anti-tumor immunity in PC."

The results revealed that the addition of 0.3% TG yielded acceptable cooking loss and emulsion stability in Lys-rich salt-reduced frankfurters, significantly improved their textural parameters, and visibly optimised their microstructure. Moreover, combination treatment with TG and Lys also promoted the gelling properties of the thermally induced gels, conferring greater viscoelasticity and stability. Meanwhile, TG and Lys positively transformed their protein conformations by promoting the generation of isopeptide bonds and enhancing the predominant molecular forces (hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions). Additionally, combination treatment with 0.3% TG and Lys increased the overall sensory score of the salt-reduced frankfurters from 45.4 to 82.6. In summary, the combined application of TG and Lys potentially serves as an efficient salt-replacement strategy in emulsified meat products, providing superior product quality and health benefits.",

With increasing Lys concentrations, the dielectric constant initially declined then rose, while dielectric loss showed an inverse pattern. MW processed samples exhibited deeper penetration than water bath (WB), with penetration depth initially dipping then rising with amino acid levels. The combo treatment enhanced electromagnetic wave absorption and optimized absorber thickness. Optimal gel thickness for MW heating was approximately 1 cm, ensuring uniform radiation penetration, high absorption, and efficient energy conversion. Infrared analysis showed reduced α-helix/β-sheet and increased β-turn/random coil structures. The red shift and fluorescence intensity indicated Lys-induced partial unfolding QP. Notably, 0.6 % Lys with MW maximized gel hardness, adhesiveness, chewiness, elasticity, and viscoelastic properties (G', G\"), significantly improving texture and rheology. The results provided a promising approach for the development of high-quality and gluten-free quinoa-based products.",

Lysine malonylation is a post-translational modification that involves various cellular functions in plants, though it is rarely studied, especially in medicinal plants. In this study, the aim was to perform a comparative quantitative proteomic study of malonylation modification on P. grandiflorus root proteins after salicylic acid treatment using Western blot with specific antibodies, affinity enrichment and LC-MS/MS analysis methods. The analysis identified 1907 malonyl sites for 809 proteins, with 414 proteins and 798 modification sites quantified with high confidence. Post-treatment, 361 proteins were upregulated, and 310 were downregulated. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that malonylation in P. grandiflorus is primarily involved in photosynthesis and carbon metabolism. Physiological and biochemical analysis showed that salicylic acid treatment increased the malondialdehyde levels, soluble protein, superoxide dismutase, and peroxidase activity but did not significantly affect the total saponins content in P. grandiflorus. These findings provide an important basis for exploring the molecular mechanisms of P. grandiflorus following salicylic acid treatment and enhance understanding of the biological function of protein lysine malonylation in plants.",

To further explore the possible involvement of the C-terminal lysine residues of the LH1 α-polypeptide, we have genetically engineered a Rhodospirillum rubrum mutant strain to yield the site-directed modifications of the terminal α-Lys60 and α-Lys61 residues of Tch. tepidum LH1 α-polypeptide. Four of the LH1 mutants exhibit a subtle blue shift of 3 nm upon deletion or substitution of the lysine residues, however, they display over 40 nm blue shifts upon Ca2+ removal by ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) treatment. Spectral properties of native Tch. tepidum LH1-RC, the LH1-only, and the mutant LH1-only complexes are compared on a structural basis, which allows us to conclude that the C-terminal lysine residues and the Ca2+ binding synergistically affect the structural integrity and the LH1-Qy spectral shift. This work demonstrates a methodology for the genetic manipulation of photosynthetic proteins lacking mutagenesis information, and may shed light on understanding the detailed structural factors involved in tuning the LH1-Qy absorption.",

There has been significant interest in exploring the effect of diet on negative social behaviors and the wider social behavior repertoire of pigs. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of dietary Lysine (Lys) and Tryptophan (Trp) levels on the social behavior of commercially housed pigs. A total of 2,293 PIC Camborough barrows with a mean starting weight of 11.87 ± 1.35 kg were used in a randomized complete block design with a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement, with 16 replicates per treatment, of the following factors: 1) Standardized ileal digestible Lys levels: 100% Lys = diets with 100% PIC requirement at the midpoint of the growth phase (Lys 100) vs 80% Lys = diets with 80% PIC requirement at the midpoint of the growth phase (Lys 80); and 2) Trp to Lys ratio of 0.210, 0.185, or 0.160. Pigs were randomly allocated across the 6 treatments over 2 starting dates. Behavior and lesion data were collected. There was an effect of Lys (P = 0.032) on ear-biting behavior, with pigs on the Lys 80 treatments showing a higher level of ear-biting behavior. We also found an effect of the Lys score week interaction on the proportion of pens showing ear lesions (P < 0.001) and an effect of the Lys Trp interaction (P = 0.030) and the Lys score week interaction (P = 0.0104) on the proportion of pens showing severe ear lesions. In conclusion, the lysine content of feed can affect the social behavior of pigs, specifically ear biting, in commercial conditions.",

The YS + ZL (Ⅳ) group was fed a basal diet supplemented with 0.3 mg/kg of selenium-yeast and 106.05 mg/kg of zinc-lysine. The experimental period lasted for 91 days. The results showed that supplementation of 0.3 mg/kg YS and 106.05 mg/kg ZL significantly increased sperm motility (P < 0.05), and significantly increased VAP, VSL, VCL, ALH, LIN, MAD and STR (P < 0.01) compared with the control group. Compared with the control group, dietary supplementation of YS and ZL increased the number of germ cells and Johnson score in groups Ⅱ, Ⅲ and Ⅳ (P < 0.01), and the number of spermatogonia and sertoli cells were significantly different from the control group (P < 0.05). Dietary supplementation of YS and ZL could increase the reproductive hormone level (P < 0.05) and serum antioxidant capacity (P < 0.05), and the fertilization rate showed a certain promoting trend (P = 0.09). In conclusion, dietary supplementation of 0.3 mg/kg YS and 106.05 mg/kg ZL can improve semen quality, promote testicular development, maintain stability of the fertilization rate, and increase reproductive hormone levels and the serum antioxidant capacity of geese.",

In this study, two novel daphnane-type diterpenes, along with ten related known ones were obtained from the flower buds of Wikstroemia chamaedaphne. Compounds 1 and 2, a ring cleavage 1α-alkyldaphnane-type backbone diterpenoids with uncommon H-10 β configuration, were elucidated by the integrated analyses of NMR spectra and experimental and calculated ECD. Compound 3 displays the most potent inhibitory activity against the histone lysine acetyltransferase PCAF and histone methyltransferase GLP. Compounds 1-3 could also bind to GLP and PCAF through hydrogen bonding, alkyl and van der Waals interactions and exhibited a high affinity as supported by the molecular docking results. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations revealed the stability of the PCAF-3 complex during the entire simulation process. Selected daphnane-type diterpenes exhibited potent activity against human BXPC-3 pancreatic cells. The cell cycle arrest experiment revealed that daphnane-type diterpenes could markedly arrest S-phases or G2/M-phase in BXPC-3 cells to inhibit cell proliferation. Overall, the results imply that daphnane-based natural products could be used as promising scaffolds for rational drug design in treatment of human diseases.",

Histone lysine demethylase 1A (KDM1A) demethylates the mono- and di-methyl groups of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) and H3K9 and plays an essential role in NSC proliferation. In this study, we investigated the effects of Seclidemstat (SP-2577), a reversible KDM1A inhibitor, and tranylcypromine (TCP), a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and recently known as an irreversible histone lysine demethylase 1A inhibitor, on NSCs. SP-2577 and TCP increased glial fibrillary acidic protein expression (GFAP), decreased βIII-tubulin (TUBB3) expression, and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in rat NSCs. SP-2577 and TCP enhanced the transcription of Gfap and reduced Tubb3 transcription. Furthermore, SP-2577 increased the transcription levels of interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor, while TCP induced the transcription level of fibroblast growth factor 2. Therefore, we show that the KDM1A inhibitors, SP-2577 and TCP, induce astrocytogenesis in rat NSCs. These findings suggest that KDM1A is a target for regulating NSCs fate and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental processes and epigenetics.",

Fish oil, for the first time, was considered as a nutritional agent for the mitigation of acrylamide (AA) and Nε-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML). The addition of fish oil at 30 μL/g significantly reduces the formation of AA, free CML, and bound CML by 39.2 %, 27.3 %, and 14.9 %, respectively, during thermal processing at 160 °C for 20-30 min in air-based thermal processed potato chips.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy is more effective in relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) than other therapies, but a high proportion of patients relapse after CAR-T cell therapy owing to antigen escape, limited persistence of CAR-T cells, and immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. CAR-T cell exhaustion is a major cause of relapse. Epigenetic modifications can regulate T cell activation, maturation and depletion; they can be applied to reduce T cell depletion, improve infiltration, and promote memory phenotype formation to reduce relapse after CAR-T cell therapy. PURPOSE: We propose to develop and validate in vitro the function of novel CAR-T cells for the treatment of DLBCL, which simultaneously express an anti-CD19 CAR with lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) short hairpin (sh)RNA to prevent depletion and prolong the survival of CAR-T cells. METHODS: We designed an shRNA sequence targeting LSD1 mRNA, and created a vector with the following elements: the U6 promoter driving expression of the LSD1 shRNA sequence, the EF1a promoter driving a second-generation anti-CD19 CAR sequence encoding an anti-CD19 single-chain variable fragment (FMC63), the CD8 hinge and transmembrane structural domains, the CD28 co-stimulatory structural domain, and the CD3ζ-activating structural domain. The MFG-LSD1 shRNA anti-CD19 CAR plasmid was first constructed, then packaged in retroviral vectors and transduced into human primary peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived T cells to generate the corresponding CAR-T cells. We examined by flow cytometry the efficiency of two CAR-T cells in killing U-2932 cells (a human DLBCL line) upon co-culture with RNAU6 anti-CD19 CAR-T cells or LSD1 shRNA anti-CD19 CAR-T cells. We analyzed Ki-67 staining of the CAR-T cells by flow cytometry on days 0, 5, and 10, and counted the cells to assess expansion. We also used flow cytometry to detect the central memory T cell (TCM) proportion. RESULTS: We detected the expression of the CAR in the CAR-T cells by flow cytometry, and observed transduction rates of 31.5% for RNAU6 anti-CD19 CAR-T cells and 60.7% for LSD1 shRNA anti-CD19 CAR-T cells. The killing efficiency of LSD1 shRNA anti-CD19 CAR-T cells was significantly higher than that of RNAU6 anti-CD19 CAR-T cells at the low effector target ratio. We further found that LSD1 shRNA anti-CD19 CAR-T cells secreted more IFN-γ and granzyme B than RNAU6 anti-CD19 CAR-T cells. CAR-T cells proliferated after U-2932 cell stimulation and were able to sustain proliferation. After stimulation via U-2932 cell co-culture, both RNAU6 anti-CD19 CAR-T and LSD1 shRNA anti-CD19 CAR-T populations had increased proportions of cells with the TCM phenotype, with a higher percentage among LSD1 shRNA anti-CD19 CAR-T cells. CONCLUSION: We developed a novel, feasible CD19-LSD1 shRNA CAR-T cell strategy for the treatment of DLBCL. Our in vitro assay results showed that LSD1 shRNA anti-CD19 CAR-T cells more effectively killed target cells than RNAU6 anti-CD19 CAR-T cells, and developed a higher proportion of TCM phenotype cells. LSD1 shRNA anti-CD19 CAR-T cells may represent a potential treatment for DLBCL.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Industrial processing and storage of milk products can strongly increase protein glycation level. Previously, we have reported that ingestion of highly glycated milk protein attenuates the postprandial rise in plasma lysine concentrations compared to the ingestion of an equivalent amount of milk protein with a low glycation level. Whether the attenuated increase in plasma lysine availability is attributed to compromised protein digestion and subsequent lysine absorption remains to be established. OBJECTIVES: The present study combined stable-isotope methodology with the ingestion of specifically produced, intrinsically labeled protein to assess protein digestion and amino acid absorption following ingestion of milk protein with a high versus low glycation level in vivo in humans. METHODS: Fifteen recreationally active, healthy young males participated in this double-blinded, randomized cross-over study. Subjects ingested 40 g intrinsically L-[1-13C]-lysine-labeled milk protein with either a low (3%) or high (50%) glycation level. Continuous intravenous infusion of L-[4,4,5,5-2H4]-lysine was combined with frequent blood sample collection during a 6-h postprandial period to evaluate dietary protein-derived lysine release into the circulation. RESULTS: Postprandial plasma lysine concentrations were lower following the ingestion of milk protein with a high versus low glycation level (time × treatment effect: P = 0.002; ƞ2 = 0.214), resulting in a 23 mmol/L x 360 min (95% confidence interval [CI]: 13, 32) lower incremental area under the curve (0 ± 12 vs 23 ± 11 mmol/L x 360 min, respectively, P < 0.001). The postprandial release of milk protein-derived lysine into the circulation was attenuated following ingestion of the protein with the high versus low glycation level (time × treatment effect: P < 0.001; ƞ2 = 0.640) and was 31% (95% CI: 26, 36) lower over the full 6-h postprandial period (18 ± 4 vs 49 ± 10% of the ingested lysine, respectively, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A high level of milk protein glycation strongly reduces postprandial plasma lysine availability in vivo in humans. Industrial processing and storage of (milk) protein products can strongly modulate protein bioavailability and, as such, lower the nutritional value of a protein source.

Developing a multifunctional nano-drug capable of simultaneously controlling bleeding, preventing infection, and promoting wound healing is critical. This study aimed to design and evaluate a nanoparticle-based solution to address these challenges effectively. Methods: Using a one-pot assembly approach, we prepared a series of nanoparticles composed of poly-L-lysine and hyodeoxycholic acid (PLL-HDCA NPs). Theoretical simulations and experimental studies were combined to optimize their structure and functionality. In vitro platelet aggregation, antibacterial assays, cytotoxicity tests, and hemolysis evaluations were performed. In vivo efficacy was assessed in various hemorrhage models, a full-thickness skin defect model, and a skin irritation test. Results: PLL-HDCA NPs demonstrated effective induction of platelet aggregation and significantly reduced bleeding time and blood loss in mouse models, including tail vein, femoral vein, artery, and liver bleeding. Antibacterial assays revealed strong activity against E. coli and S. aureus. Wound healing studies showed that PLL-HDCA NPs promoted tissue repair in a full-thickness skin defect model. Cytotoxicity and hemolysis tests indicated minimal impact on human cells and significantly reduced hemolysis rates compared to PLL alone. Skin irritation tests confirmed the safety of PLL-HDCA NPs for external application. Conclusions: PLL-HDCA NPs represent a safe, efficient, and multifunctional nano-drug suitable for topical applications to control bleeding, combat infection, and facilitate wound healing, making them promising candidates for use in battlefield and hospital settings."

For this purpose, a total of 816 day-old broiler birds having an average weight of 38 ± 3 g were divided into six dietary treatments in such a way that each treatment had eight replicates and each replicate had 17 birds. The treatments were 0.95 (1.19/1.25, 1.12/1.18, and 1.05/1.1), 1 (1.25/1.25, 1.18/1.18, and 1.1/1.1), 1.05 (1.31/1.25, 1.24/1.18, and 1.17/1.1), 1.10 (1.38/1.25, 1.30/1.18, and 1.23/1.1), 1.15 (1.44/1.25, 1.36/1.18, and 1.28/1.1), and 1.20 (1.50/1.25, 1.42/1.18, and 1.34/1.1) Arg/Lys divided into different amounts according to the nutritional needs of starter, grower, and finisher diets, respectively. The results showed that in the finisher phase, the FI was influenced cubically, while in the overall period, a quadratic effect was observed for the FI (p < 0.05). The results of BWG showed that BWG was linearly increased in birds given different Arg/Lys in the grower, finisher, and overall period (p < 0.05). The results also showed that during the grower, finisher, and overall phases, the body weight gain (BWG) was better in birds fed with 1.05 and 1.10 Arg/Lys (p < 0.05). Furthermore, a better feed conversion ratio (FCR) was shown in the starter and grower phases at 1.10 and 1.15 Arg/Lys (p < 0.05). The results of nutrient digestibility explored showed that the experimental treatments had a better effect (p < 0.05) on dry matter and crude fat digestibility in birds fed with 1.19/1.25, 1.12/1.18, and 1.05/1.1 and 1.25/1.25, 1.18/1.18, and 1.1/1.1 Arg/Lys in their diets while the crude protein digestibility remained unaffected with different treatments (p > 0.05). The treatments had no effect (p > 0.05) on relative organ weights, immune organs, and carcass characteristics. However, higher titers of ND and IBD were observed in birds fed with Arg/Lys of 1.38/1.25, 1.30/1.18, and 1.23/1.1 and 1.50/1.25, 1.42/1.18, and 1.34/1.1 in their diets (p < 0.05). Based on the results of the current study, it is concluded that the inclusion levels of 1.38/1.25, 1.30/1.18, and 1.23/1.1, and 1.44/1.25, 1.36/1.18, and 1.28/1.1 Arg/Lys resulted in better growth performance and immune response in the broiler birds, respectively. Therefore, adjusting the levels of Arg/Lys in feed is recommended to enhance broilers' growth performance and immune response."

      "abstract": "The aim of this experiment was to investigate the effects of intravenous infusion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and feeding different ratios of lysine (Lys) and methionine (Met) on feed intake, apparent digestibility, rumen fermentation and microorganisms in young Holstein bulls. Five seven-month-old Holstein bulls with similar body weights (279 ± 42 kg) were selected and subjected to a 5 × 5 Latin square experiment. The control group (CON) was fed with basal diet and the ratio of Lys to Met in the diet was adjusted to 3.0: 1. The experimental groups were received LPS infusion while being fed the basal diet (TRT1), along with LPS infusion and the addition of rumen-protected lysine (RPL) and rumen-protected methionine (RPM) to make the ratio of Lys to Met to 2.5:1 (TRT2), 3.0:1 (TRT3) and 3.5: 1 (TRT4), respectively. The LPS jugular infusion dose was set at 0.01 μg/kg body weight on days 1-3 and 0.05 μg/kg body weight on days 4-7. The trial was conducted over five periods, consisting of a 7-day trial period and a 6-day interval. The results indicated that there were no significant effects of LPS infusion on feed intake and apparent digestibility in young Holstein bulls fed different ratios of Lys and Met (p > 0.05). The treatment had no significant effects on the pH and total volatile fatty acids (p > 0.05). Compared with CON, the acetate content in the experimental groups exhibited an increasing trend (p = 0.066), while the content of NH3-N decreased significantly (p < 0.05). LPS infusion had no significant effect on rumen microorganisms at either the species or phylum level (p > 0.05). However, feeding different ratios of Lys and Met could significantly increasing the abundance of Oribacterium (p < 0.05) and tended to increase the abundance of norank_f__norank_o__RF_39 at the genus level (p = 0.087). These findings suggest that adding RPL and RPM into the diet may enhance the rumen environment in young Holstein bulls. Under the conditions of this experiment, adding RPL and RPM can mitigate the negative effects associated with LPS infusion, with an optimal ratio of Lys and Met is 3.0:1."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is one of the most malignancy diseases. Lysine β-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) has been reported to involve various metabolism and cancer progression. METHODS: Data from online databases (TCGA and GEO) were retrieved for the selection of differential expressed Kbhb site genes (DTRGs). Univariate cox and LASSO analysis were performed to identify the prognostic DTRGs. Based on the optimal DTRGs, a prognostic risk score model was established. Kaplan-Meier and Receiver operator characteristic analysis were conducted to evaluate the predicting ability of the prognosis model. Generated with clinical data, independent analysis and nomogram model were performed. Finally, the differences of survival, immune cell levels, immunotherapy response, drug sensitivity between high- and low-risk groups were explored. RESULTS: A total of 63 DTRGs were identified in PAAD, and these genes were related to cell division and apoptosis biological functions. Through univariate cox regression and LASSO analysis, 30 DTRGs were selected to be related to prognosis and five (KRT18, ANLN, ECT2, RBM5, and RBM6) were identified as the optimal DTRGs in PAAD. Based on the five optimal DTRGs, a prognostic risk score model was constructed, with promising predictive ability in PAAD survival (AUC >0.70). High-risk group showed lower survival rate (P < 0.05). Moreover, based on the risk score, a nomogram model was also established, which possessed perfect stability. Finally, lower risk score was related to higher immune cell levels, indicating an immune activation in low-risk status, which maybe the reason for the better survival in low-risk group. Furthermore, the immunotherapy response and drug sensitivity were all higher than that in low-risk groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: A five-gene prognosis risk model which exhibit promising predictive ability in survival is constructed for patients with PAAD."

The tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), which includes T cells, macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells and B cells, significantly affects tumor progression, immunosuppression and drug resistance in patients with GC. In recent years, immunotherapy has become the first-line or second-line treatment for GC. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1, also known as KDM1A) was the first identified human histone demethylase, and high expression of LSD1 in GC is closely related to the dysfunction of the above types of immune cells. Therefore, LSD1 inhibitors could regulate the cytotoxic effects of immune cells against tumor cells through a variety of mechanisms to control tumor progression. In this review, we discuss the effects of LSD1 inhibitors on immune cells in GC and propose LSD1 as a new potential target for immunotherapy in GC."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by progressive cartilage degeneration mediated by various molecular pathways, including inflammatory and autophagic processes. SET domain-containing lysine methyltransferase 7 (SETD7), a methyltransferase, has been implicated in OA pathology. This study investigates the expression pattern of SETD7 in OA and its role in promoting interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β)-induced chondrocyte injury through modulation of autophagy and inflammation. METHODS: The expression of SETD7 in cartilage tissues from OA patients and healthy controls was quantified using quantitative reverse transcription PCR and Western blot analysis. Small interfering RNA targeting SETD7 (si-SETD7) was transfected into human articular chondrocytes (HACs) treated with IL-1β to examine its impact on cellular viability, apoptosis, inflammatory responses, and autophagy. Functional assays including Cell Counting Kit-8, flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and commercial kits were employed to assess biochemical changes. Interaction between YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 2 (YTHDF2) and SETD7 was explored using RNA immunoprecipitation and co-immunoprecipitation assays. RESULTS: SETD7 was overexpressed in OA cartilage compared with controls and increased further upon IL-1β treatment. Knockdown of SETD7 in IL-1β-treated HACs improved cellular viability, decreased apoptosis, and reversed the adverse effects on lactate dehydrogenase release and inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6) while enhancing antioxidant enzymes (catalase, malondialdehyde, and superoxide dismutase). Additionally, autophagy was restored, as evidenced by changes in the levels of autophagy related 5, Beclin1, and sequestosome 1. Interfering with autophagy using chloroquine negated the protective effects of SETD7 knockdown. Furthermore, YTHDF2 was found to stabilize SETD7 mRNA, influencing its expression and enhancing IL-1β-induced chondrocyte injury. CONCLUSION: SETD7 plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of OA by modulating chondrocyte survival, apoptosis, inflammation, and autophagy. The interaction between YTHDF2 and SETD7 exacerbates chondrocyte injury under inflammatory conditions, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for OA treatment. The YTHDF2/SETD7 axis offers a novel insight into the molecular mechanisms governing cartilage degeneration in OA.",

      "abstract": "Lysine succinylation is an emerging post-translational modification of proteins. It involves the addition of the succinyl group to lysine residues of target proteins through both enzymatic and non-enzymatic pathways. This modification can alter the structure of the target protein, which, in turn, impacts protein activity and function and is involved in a wide range of diseases. In the field of cancer biology, lysine succinylation has been shown to exert a substantial influence on metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells, regulation of gene expression, and activation of oncogenic signaling pathways. Furthermore, lysine succinylation modulates the activity of immune cells, thereby affecting the immune evasion of tumor cells. Notably, researchers are currently developing inhibitors and activators of lysine succinylation which can inhibit tumor cell proliferation, migration, and metastasis, with potential usefulness in future clinical practice. This article provides an overview of the biological functions of lysine succinylation in cancer and its potential applications in cancer treatment, offering a novel perspective for future cancer management."

      "abstract": "Acute pancreatitis (AP) represents a severe inflammatory condition of the exocrine pancreas, precipitating systemic organ dysfunction and potential failure. The global prevalence of acute pancreatitis is on an ascending trajectory. The condition carries a significant mortality rate during acute episodes. This underscores the imperative to elucidate the etiopathogenic pathways of acute pancreatitis, enhance comprehension of the disease's intricacies, and identify precise molecular targets coupled with efficacious therapeutic interventions. The pathobiology of acute pancreatitis encompasses not only the ectopic activation of trypsinogen but also extends to disturbances in calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial impairment, autophagic disruption, and endoplasmic reticulum stress responses. Notably, the realm of epigenetic regulation has garnered extensive attention and rigorous investigation in acute pancreatitis research over recent years. One of these modifications, lysine acetylation, is a reversible post-translational modification of proteins that affects enzyme activity, DNA binding, and protein stability by changing the charge on lysine residues and altering protein structure. Numerous studies have revealed the importance of acetylation modification in acute pancreatitis, and that it is a favorable target for the design of new drugs for this disease. This review centers on lysine acetylation, examining the strides made in acute pancreatitis research with a focus on the contributory role of acetylomic alterations in the pathophysiological landscape of acute pancreatitis, thereby aiming to delineate novel therapeutic targets and advance the development of more efficacious treatment modalities.",

This study investigates the therapeutic effect of ART in ischemic stroke (IS) and delves into its functional mechanism. Bioinformatics analyses revealed lysine demethylase 1A (KDM1A) as a promising target of ART aberrantly overexpressed in the context of IS. Increased KDM1A expression was detected in oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-treated hippocampal neurons and transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO)-challenged mice. Treatment with ART reduced KDM1A protein level, thus protecting mouse hippocampal neurons from OGD/R-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis. In vivo, ART reduced infarct size, reduced brain content, enhanced neurological function, and enhanced neuronal survival in tMCAO. Regarding the downstream cascade, KDM1A was found to repress transcription of sphingosine kinase 2 (SPHK2) by removing H3K4me2 modification near the SPHK2 promoter. Either KDM1A overexpression or SPHK2 knockdown abrogated the neuroprotective effects of ART. The ample evidence of this study suggests that ART fulfills neuroprotective functions in the context of IS by protecting SPHK2 from KDM1A-mediated transcription repression, highlighting ART as a promising regimen for the treatment of IS.",

High rhizospheric Cr concentrations inhibit nutrients uptake and their translocation to aboveground parts, thus can affect the growth and development of crop plants. This experiment was designed to evaluate the effects of sole and combined zinc-lysine and iron-lysine applications on photosynthetic efficacy, antioxidative defense, oxidative stress, and nutrient uptake and translocation under Cr stress. Chromium stress exhibited toxic effects on the growth, physiological, and biochemical indices of pearl millet. The combined application of zinc-lysine and iron-lysine significantly decreased malondialdehyde (MDA; 25%) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; 22.44%), while increased superoxide dismutase (SOD; 19.75%), catalase (CAT; 26.16%), peroxidase (POD; 19.62%), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX; 23.52%) activities under Cr toxicity compared to the control treatment. In addition, the combined application of zinc-lysine and iron-lysine effectively improved net photosynthesis (43.63%), stomatal conductance (20.05%), transpiration rate (20.14%), internal CO2 concentration (34.28%), total chlorophyll (43.12%), relative water content (23.95%), membrane stability index (32.77%), and proline content (25.53%) under stress condition and compared with control. Our results also indicated that the combined application of zinc-lysine and iron-lysine decreased Cr uptake in both shoot and root by 31.25% and 32%, and increased zinc and iron uptake by 39.28% and 36.67%, respectively, over the control, under Cr stress conditions. Moreover, under stress conditions, combined zinc-lysine and iron-lysine effectively improved growth traits particularly shoot and root dry weights, by 8% and 36.84%, respectively, over the control treatment. Overall, our results demonstrated that combined zinc-lysine and iron-lysine was more effective in mitigating Cr toxicity in pearl millet compared with the sole application of these treatments or the control."

      "abstract": "The objective of this experiment was to estimate the bioavailability (BA) of rumen-protected (RP) His, RPLys, and 2 RPMet products using 3 in vivo methods: area under the curve (AUC), plasma dose-response (PDR), and fecal free AA (FFAA) methods. We used 8 rumen-cannulated cows in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square experiment with 16-d periods. Treatments were (1) abomasal infusion of water (control), (2) abomasal infusion of free His, Lys, and Met (FAA), (3) administration of RPHis + RPLys + RPMet1 (rumen-protected methionine protected with ethyl cellulose; RPAA1), and (4) administration of RPHis + RPLys + RPMet2 (rumen-protected methionine protected with a pH-sensitive polymer; RPAA2). On d 7 of each experimental period, a pulse-dose of water (control) or FAA were infused into the abomasum of the cows, or RPAA were placed directly in the rumen, and blood samples were taken from the jugular vein through a catheter 11 times over a 24-h period for the AUC method. Following the AA pulse-dose, infusion lines were installed into the abomasum for continuous infusion of FAA for the PDR method, or RPAA were fed from d 12 to d 16 and cows were fitted with urinary catheters for total collection of feces for the FFAA method. Fecal collection and blood sampling were conducted from d 14 to 16. Due to technical issues likely leading to unrealistic BA estimates, data for the PDR method are reported in the supplemental material. Relative BA based on the AUC method (computed as AUC of RPAA treatment plasma AA concentration divided by AUC of FAA treatment plasma AA concentration) was lower for RPMet1 compared with RPMet2 (43% vs. 61%) and was 45% (SEM = 3.35) and 72% (SEM = 5.99), for RPHis and RPLys, respectively. Rumen escape fractions of RPAA, estimated in a previous study using an in situ method, and digestibility data from the current study were used for calculations of BA for the FFAA method. Bioavailability based on the FFAA method was lower for RPMet1 (67%) compared with RPMet2 (91%) and was 87% (SEM = 0.71) and 75% (SEM = 2.75) for RPHis and RPLys, respectively. The relative differences in estimated BA based on both the AUC and FFAA methods between the RPMet products were as expected, based on literature, and data for all 4 RPAA products corresponded well with previously estimated BA using the FFAA method. The unrealistic data for the PDR method were likely caused by technical deviations from the original method (e.g., once-daily dosing of RPAA and inability to capture representative plasma concentration data with the sampling time points). Therefore, comparison of the PDR method with the AUC and FFAA methods were not possible in this study. Further comparisons are needed without deviations from the original PDR method. Variability in BA data and differences in estimated BA between the in vivo methods highlight the current challenges for accurate measurements of relative in vivo BA of RPAA products. Different protection technologies may call for different methodology to be used for BA estimations. Further research and standardization of in vivo BA methods are warranted.",

MiR-100-5p/Lysine(K)-specific demethylase 6B (KDM6B) can inhibit osteogenesis, but their effects on bone union remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the effects of miR-100-5p/KDM6B on osteogenic differentiation and bone defects. Wild-type or microRNA 100 (miR-100) knockdown mice underwent critical-size defect (CSD) cranial surgery and collagen I/poly-γ-glutamic acid scaffold treatment. The crania was observed using microcomputed tomography, hematoxylin and eosin staining, Masson staining, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. Primary-cultured BMSCs transfected with miR-100-5p mimic/inhibitor and KDM6B cDNA were evaluated for osteogenic differentiation using Alizarin Red staining, ALP activity detection, and Western blot analysis. Genetic transcription levels were detected using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. This study found that miR-100 depletion promotes defect healing in mouse calvaria, increases the proportion of new bone and osteoblasts in calvaria, and activates the expression of KDM6B and osteocalcin (OCN) proteins, promoting the transcription of bone morphogenetic protein-2, Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), OCN, and KDM6B, while methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) decreased. Furthermore, miR-100-5p mimics suppressed osteogenic differentiation by inhibiting KDM6B with increased H3K27me3, ALP, Runx2, OCN, and osteopontin protein expression, while miR-100-5p inhibitors have opposite effects. Moreover, KDM6B can reverse miR-100-5p mimic effects. Notably, scaffolds carrying miR-100-5p mimics/inhibitors transfected BMSCs were placed in CSD mice and found that miR-100-5p inhibitors have a better effect on CSD healing and increase new bone without inflammatory cell infiltration. This study proved that miR-100-5p depletion promotes bone union and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs via KDM6B/H3K27me3."

      "abstract": "Salvia miltiorrhiza, the anticancer properties of these components are multifaceted, encompassing the inhibition of tumor growth, prevention of the metastatic spread of cancer cells, enhancement of the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and the suppression of angiogenesis, which is crucial for tumor growth and survival. In the context of our recent study, we have discovered that tanshinone I, one of the active components of Salvia miltiorrhiza, possesses the ability to inhibit the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells, both in laboratory settings and within living organisms. To further understand the molecular mechanisms behind this effect, we conducted a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis. Our findings indicated that tanshinone I exerts its inhibitory action by downregulating the expression of genes associated with glycolysis. Specifically, tanshinone I decreased the expression of glycolysis-related genes such as HK2 (hexokinase 2), PFK (phosphofructokinase), ENO2 (enolase 2), and LDHA (lactate dehydrogenase A). Inhibiting lactate production by tanshinone I application reduced the level of histone H3 lysine 18 lactylation (H3K18la), which reduced the expression of tumor-associated genes, such as TTK, PDGFRβ, YTHDF2 and RUBCNL. In addition, tanshinone I alleviated the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In summary, tanshinone I blocks glycolysis to regulate histone H3 lysine 18 lactylation (H3K18la), which inhibits ovarian cancer cell growth, revealing the anticancer mechanism of tanshinone I.",

Hence, we report for the first time the design, synthesis, and characterization of new hybrid organic-inorganic stimuli-responsive nanoplexes (NPX) for bioimaging and killing brain cancer cells (GBM, U-87). These nanoplexes were built through coupling two nanoconjugates, produced using a facile, sustainable, green aqueous colloidal process (\"bottom-up\"). One nanocomponent was based on cationic epsilon-poly-l-lysine polypeptide (εPL) conjugated with ZnS quantum dots (QDs) acting as chemical ligand and cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) for bioimaging of cancer cells (QD@εPL). The second nanocomponent was based on anionic carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) polysaccharide surrounding superparamagnetic magnetite \"nanozymes\" (MNZ) behaving as a capping macromolecular shell (MNZ@CMC) for killing cancer cells through chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and magnetohyperthermia (MHT). The results demonstrated the effective production of supramolecular aqueous colloidal nanoplexes (QD@εPL_MNZ@CMC, NPX) integrated into single nanoplatforms, mainly electrostatically stabilized by εPL/CMC biomolecules with anticancer activity against U-87 cells using 2D and 3D spheroid models. They displayed nanotheranostics (i.e., diagnosis and therapy) behavior credited to the photonic activity of QD@εPL with luminescent intracellular bioimaging, amalgamated with a dual-mode killing effect of GBM cancer cells through CDT by nanozyme-induced biocatalysis and as \"nanoheaters\" by magnetically-responsive hyperthermia therapy.",

      "abstract": "It has been established that essential amino acids (EAA) regulate protein synthesis in mammary epithelial cells by rapidly altering the phosphorylation state of translation factors. However, the long-term transcriptional response to EAA supply has been investigated much less. Eight transcription factors were selected as candidate mediators of EAA effects on mammary cell function via the amino acid response (ATF4, ATF6), mitogen-activated protein kinase (JUN, FOS, EGR1), and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (MYC, HIF1A, SREBF1). The objective was to determine if and when expression of these candidate genes was affected in primary cultures of bovine mammary epithelial cells more than 24 h after imposing an EAA deficiency, and to evaluate effects of EAA deficiency on protein synthesis, endoplasmic reticulum size, cell proliferation, and lipogenesis. Differentiated cells were cultured in 1 of 3 treatment media representing normal physiological concentrations of all amino acids (CTL), low lysine (LK), or low methionine (LM) for 24, 40, 48, or 60 h. Both LK and LM suppressed protein synthesis and activated ATF4 expression, indicating the classic amino acid response pathway had been triggered. However, there was no effect of LK or LM on endoplasmic reticulum size, possibly related to elevated ATF6 expression on LM. Expression of early response genes JUN, FOS, EGR1 and MYC was not elevated by EAA deficiency but LM decreased EGR1 expression. LM also increased expression of HIF1A. The EGR1 and HIF1A expression results are consistent with the decrease in cell proliferation rate observed. Variable responses in SREBF1 expression to LK and LM at different timepoints may have contributed to a lack of effect on lipogenesis rates. These findings indicate that EAA deficiency may inhibit mammary protein synthesis and cell proliferation through transcription factors.",

      "abstract": "Cancer treatments have continued to improve tremendously over the past decade, but therapy resistance is still a common, major factor encountered by patients diagnosed with cancer. Chemoresistance arises due to various circumstances and among these causes, increasing evidence has shown that enzymes referred to as protein methyltransferases (PMTs) play a significant role in the development of chemoresistance in various cancers. These enzymes are responsible for the methylation of different amino acids, particularly lysine and arginine, via protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs) and protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs), respectively. Various PMTs have been identified to be dysregulated in the development of cancer and chemoresistance. Nonetheless, the functional role of these PMTs in the development of chemoresistance is poorly characterised. This advocates the need for innovative approaches and technologies suitable for better characterisation of these PMTs and their potential clinical inhibitors. In the case of a handful of PMTs, inhibitory small molecules which can function as anticancer drugs have been developed and have also entered clinical trials. Considering all this, PMTs have become a promising and valuable target in cancer chemoresistance related research. This review will give a small introduction on the different PKMTs and PRMTs families which are dysregulated in different cancers and the known proteins targeted by the respective enzymes. The focus will then shift towards PMTs known to be involved in chemoresistance development and the inhibitors developed against these, together with their mode of action. Lastly, the current obstacles and future perspectives of PMT inhibitors in cancer chemoresistance will be discussed."

Previous studies have indicated that cyclophosphamide treatment induces cellular senescence in patients, although the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we reported that cyclophosphamide induced T cell senescence in the spleen of mice. Meanwhile, phosphoramide mustard cyclohexanamine (PM), an active metabolite of cyclophosphamide, triggered human T cell senescence. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that PM promoted senescence of primary human T cells through the activation of the p53 signaling pathway. Moreover, PM strongly increased the acetylation of p53 lysine 373 in T cells. Compared with the wild-type p53, mutating lysine 373 of p53 to arginine markedly reduced the p21 and p16 expression in PM treated Jurkat cells. Notably, we found that theophylline, an activator of histone deacetylase HDAC, ameliorated the senescence phenotype of both primary human T cells induced by PM and splenic T cells induced by cyclophosphamide in mice. Together, the results from current study could provide a potential strategy against cyclophosphamide-induced T cell senescence by inhibiting p53 acetylation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a common histological subtype of malignant renal neoplasm. Protein lysine lactylation (Kla) plays a crucial role in tumor metabolic reprogramming. However, little is known regarding the distribution and potential biological functions of Kla in ccRCC. This study aimed to systematically investigate the role of Kla in ccRCC. METHODS: A total of 12 ccRCC samples were collected from 6 patients. Western blotting was performed to determine the trend of Kla-modified proteins in ccRCC. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantitatively analyze Kla in ccRCC. Gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses were conducted to clarify the biological functions and interactional relationships of differentially lactylated proteins (DLPs). RESULTS: In total, 239 DLPs, including 441 lactylated sites, were identified by comparing ccRCC tissues with adjacent normal tissues. Kla-related enzymes have a higher affinity for alanine than for other amino acid residues in ccRCC. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that most DLPs were localized in the cytoplasm and mitochondria. GO enrichment analysis showed that most of the DLPs were enriched in metabolism-associated biological processes, including the purine ribonucleotide, monocarboxylic acid, ribonucleoside triphosphate, purine nucleoside triphosphate, and ATP metabolic processes. KEGG analysis indicated that most DLPs were also enriched in metabolism-related pathways, including glycolysis, amino acid (valine, leucine, and isoleucine) degradation, pyruvate metabolism, fatty acid degradation, and the citrate cycle. The top 20 hub proteins were screened from the PPI network based on their degree ranks. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the role of Kla in ccRCC, which will extend our understanding of the potential molecular mechanisms underlying ccRCC formation and progression. These key Kla-modified proteins may be promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of ccRCC. However, further molecular experiments are required to validate these findings.",

Variability in lysine requirements arises due to factors such as age, sex and environmental conditions. Optimising pig health and production efficiency and minimising nitrogen excretion require accurate knowledge of estimated lysine requirements accounting for factors such as genetics, feeding practices, scientific advancements, and environmental considerations. This study aimed to determine standardised ileal digestible (SID) lysine requirements of weaned piglets (5-30 kg) based on a literature review using meta-analytical approaches. The literature review yielded 344 studies that were screened for title and abstract. In total, 41 experiments met the inclusion criteria, resulting in a dataset of 206 treatment means. Linear, quadratic and linear-plateau models were used to gain insight into the effect of SID lysine addition on average daily gain and feed efficiency for the combined dataset and separately for the individual experiments. Regression analysis showed a predominant linear increase in average daily gain and feed efficiency as an overall response to increasing lysine levels across both the combined dataset and individual experiments. Breakpoint estimation from the linear-plateau models was inconclusive, indicating that the optimal SID lysine requirement to maximise piglet growth performance likely exceeded the upper lysine levels tested in most studies, thus surpassing 1.3 g SID lysine per MJ net energy. This review indicates high values for the lysine requirement to achieve maximum growth performance. Results may suggest that piglet feed formulation should focus on an optimal dietary SID lysine to CP ratio, rather than SID lysine per kg of diet or unit of net energy. However, more research is needed to investigate this suggestion.",

While previous studies have documented its antifungal properties through various biochemical mechanisms, the role of BCPO in modulating epigenetic modifications of DNA via histone deacetylases (HDACs) has received comparatively less attention. The study aims to elucidate how BCPO inhibits Fusarium proliferatum by affecting histone acetylation. Our results indicate that BCPO enhances FPRO_01165 (FpSIR2) enzyme activity to 6.01 ng/min/mg, representing a 55.30 % increase. Molecular docking analysis and molecular dynamics simulation confirmed the interaction between BCPO and FpSIR2. Furthermore, high concentrations (HC) of BCPO significantly inhibited the growth of F. proliferatum, resulting in marked reductions in H3K9ac and H3K27ac modification levels. We conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify enrichments of H3K9ac and H3K27ac, while also obtaining transcriptomic data from the HC treatment group. Combined analyses revealed that decreased levels of H3K9ac and H3K27ac primarily affected ribosomal pathways in F. proliferatum, leading to downregulation of several ribosomal genes and their corresponding proteins, such as RPL4, RPS19, and RPS16. Our findings suggest that BCPO stimulates both the production and activity of FpSIR2, which subsequently inhibits histone lysine acetylation in F. proliferatum. This inhibition suppresses ribosome biosynthesis and function as well as overall growth in this pathogen. The property of BCPO to reduce acetylation provides new insights for developing highly efficient yet low-toxicity antifungal agents.",

A combined algaecide treatment, similar to combination antibiotic therapy, may more rapidly and effectively remove cyanobacteria by broad targeting of different growth mechanisms, reducing the recovery of bloom-forming cyanobacteria. To confirm this hypothesis, hydrogen peroxide (10.5 mg/L), L-lysine (8.2 mg/L), and mixed treatment (hydrogen peroxide: 8.4 mg/L; L-lysine: 6.7 mg/L) of both chemicals were examined for cyanobacterial removal in a 7-day mesocosm study. We found that both hydrogen peroxide and L-lysine effectively reduced cyanobacterial abundance to less than 1% at the end of the experiment. Mixed mesocosm phytoplankton communities responded similarly to hydrogen peroxide treatment throughout the sampling period. Microcystis abundance sharply dropped within 24 h (94% reduction) and Microcystis was no longer detected by day 7. Of the three treatments, the mixed treatment had the greatest impact on Microcystis abundance and gene expression. In lysine mesocosms, cyanobacteria were replaced by Chlorophyta, whereas the hydrogen peroxide and mixed treatments led to a shift toward the eustigmatophyte Nannochloropsis. Transcriptomics revealed that heterotrophic bacteria such as Exiguobacterium, which was resilient to hydrogen peroxide and mixed treatments, benefited from increased catalase expression, which helped mitigate oxidative stress and allowed them to dominate in bacterial succession. Lysine toxicity on microbial communities and taxa sensitivity likely stemmed from amino acid homeostasis disruptions as well as abnormal lysine riboswitch and degradation activity. Overall, a combination cyanobacterial treatment approach using hydrogen peroxide and L-lysine successfully improved the removal efficiency of toxic cyanobacteria.",

In this study, we perform metabolomics and expression analysis of tissues from Aldh7a1-deficient mice, which reveal tissue-specific differences in lysine metabolism and other metabolic pathways. We also develop a fluorescent biosensor to characterize lysine transporter activity and identify competitive substrates that reduce the accumulation of lysine catabolites in ALDH7A1-deficient HEK293 cells. Lastly, we show that intravenous administration of lysine α-oxidase from Trichoderma viride reduces lysine and P6C levels by >80% in mice. Our results improve our understanding of lysine metabolism and make inroads toward improving therapeutic strategies for lysine catabolic disorders.",

A detailed structure-activity relationship exploration was carried out to discover multiple derivatives with nanomolar enzymatic IC50 values. Further biological evaluation demonstrated that these compounds acted as selective and reversible LSD1 inhibitors. The representative compounds exhibited highly potent antiproliferative activity against both AML (MV4-11 and Kasumi-1) and SCLC (NCI-H526) cell lines. Additionally, they effectively activated CD86 mRNA expression in MV4-11 cells and induced differentiation of AML cell lines. Notably, the most promising compound 23e showed a favorable oral PK profile and effectively suppressed the tumor growth in an AML xenograft model. Overall, our medicinal chemistry efforts provide compound 23e as a lead compound for developing LSD1 inhibitors for the treatment of AML and other advanced malignancies.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one Awassi ewes nursing single lambs were individually housed and assigned randomly to one of four treatment groups (2 × 2 factorial design). Ewes in treatment groups were (with supplemental RPL and RPM) or were not (without supplemental RPL and RPM) supplemented with lysine (8.5 gm/day) and methionine (4 gm/day) and were fed diets containing either 13.2 (moderate protein) or 11.1% (low protein) protein. RESULTS: No interactions between supplemental AA and dietary protein levels were observed. Supplying ewes with L and M did not affect (p ≥ 0.06) their nutrient intake or their final body weights (BWs). Additionally, milk composition, yield, and efficiency were not affected by supplemental L and M. Decreasing dietary protein levels did not affect (p = 0.13) the final BWs, milk yield, composition, and efficiency but decreased (p < 0.01) nutrient intake of ewes. CONCLUSION: Under our study conditions, reducing the protein contents of the diets from 13.2% to 11.1% had no negative impact on late-nursing ewes. Regardless of dietary protein level, the beneficial effect of supplying L and M was not evident."

      "abstract": "Among the known breast cancers, the subtype with HER2 receptors-overexpressing cells is associated with a poor prognosis. The adopted monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab has improved clinical outcomes, but it is associated with drug resistance and relatively high costs. The present work adopted the peptide solid-phase synthesis method to synthesise branched poly(ε-lysine) peptide dendrons with 8 branching arms integrating, at their carboxy terminal molecular root, either an arginine or the HER2 receptor-binding sequence LSYCCK or the scramble sequence CSCLYK. These dendrons were synthesised in quantities higher than 100 mg/batch and with a purity exceeding 95%. When tested with two types of breast cancer cells, the dendrons led to levels of inhibition in the HER2 receptor-overexpressing breast cancer cells (SKBR3) comparable to Trastuzumab and higher than breast cancer cells with low receptor expression (MDA-MB-231) where inhibition was more moderate. Noticeably, the presence of the amino acid sequence LSYCCK at the dendron molecular root did not appear to produce any additional inhibitory effect. This was demonstrated also when the scramble sequence CSCLYK was integrated into the dendron and by the lack of any antiproliferative effect by the control linear target sequence. The specific inhibitory effect on proliferation was finally proven by the absence of cytotoxicity and normal expression of the cell migration marker N-Cadherin. Therefore, the present study shows the potential of poly(ε-lysine) dendrons as a cost-effective alternative to Trastuzumab in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.",

      "abstract": "Fluoride is an essential trace element for human. Adequate levels of fluoride are crucial for maintaining skeletal growth, but excessive fluoride exposure entering the body can cause renal damage, including damaged renal tubules and impaired renal function. However, the mechanism on fluoride-induced kidney injury remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the immune-inflammatory imbalance induced by fluoride and its possible mechanism in the kidneys. Mice were exposed to sodium fluoride (NaF) (0, 25, 50 and 100 mg/L) for five months. The results showed that NaF increased the renal weight and renal index. The NaF-treated groups exhibited higher serum creatinine (Cre), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), albumin (ALB) total protein (TP) levels. Further, NaF increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels and malondialdehyde (MDA) level. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was reduced and glutathione (GSH) activities were reduced in fluoride-treated group. NaF treatment also downregulated the nuclear factor E2-related factor (Nrf2) protein and its downstream enzymes heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H: Quinone Oxidoreductase 1(NQO1) in the kidneys. Further, NaF shifted Th1/Th2 balance toward Th1 bias. Similarly, NaF exhibited increased macrophages and augmented M1 differentiation but suppressed M2 differentiation. The renal inflammatory response was also induced by fluoride via activation of the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and increase of the pro-inflammatory factors tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-18 (IL-18). In addition, NaF treatment reduced the expression of the histone 2B lysine 12 crotonylation (H2BK12cr) and H4K8cr proteins as well as decreased the histone acetyltransferase P300 protein. NaF incresed the protein expression of histone decrotonylation enzyme sirtuin1 (sirt1) and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) and upregulated HDAC2 protein. These findings demonstrate that fluoride exposure induces renal dysfunction and oxidative injury, affects M1/M2 polarization and Th1/Th2 differentiation, and promotes the inflammatory response via histone lysine crotonylation, ultimately resulting in nephrotoxicity.",

There have been accelerating efforts to identify potent and selective small molecules that can target individual KATs and BrDs with the goal of developing new therapeutics, and some of these agents are in clinical trials. Here, we summarize the different families of KATs and BrDs, discuss their functions and structures, and highlight key advances in the design and development of chemical agents that show promise in blocking the action of these chromatin proteins for disease treatment.",

      "abstract": "Diet-induced metabolic dysfunction steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is also called as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with limited effective strategies available. We previously have shown that chikusetsusaponin IVa (CHS), a dietary saponin from herbs in South American known for their metabolic benefits, mitigates diet-induced diabetes. In this study we investigated the beneficial effects of CHS on MASLD and the underlying mechanisms. MAFLD mouse model was established by the high-fat diet (HFD) for 6 weeks and then were treated with CHS (50 mg·kg-1·d-1, i.g.) for another 8 weeks. By conducting transcriptomic analysis in palmitic acid-treated HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes as well as lipidomic analysis in liver tissues, we demonstrated that HFD activated the intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) pathway, leading to the release of FGF15/19, which in turn promoted hepatic FXR-SHP binding with cAMP-responsive element-binding protein H (CREBH), thereby inhibiting CREBH-mediated fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and ketogenesis. Intriguingly, we found that CHS improved lipid metabolism in HFD mice by suppressing the enterohepatic crosstalk of FXR-SHP to enhance CREBH transactivation. Among these, lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1)-mediated histone demethylation played a crucial role in lipid metabolic reprogramming. Moreover, we identified LSD1 as a critical cellular target of CHS, directly binding to Lys661 and Tyr761 of LSD1 to inhibit its histone demethylation activity. Our results suggest that targeting intestinal LSD1 with CHS could be a promising strategy for MAFLD treatment, offering new insights into the bioavailability and efficacy of natural products.",

However, the prognostic value of histone Kla in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: OSCC RNA expression data were obtained from the TCGA and GEO databases. We explored the prognostic value of histone Kla in OSCC via constructing a Cox model and determined the role of Kla in OSCC drug susceptibility and tumor microenvironment (TME). In addition, the biological roles of candidate biomarkers were identified. RESULTS: A total of 1223 Kla-specific genes were obtained, with 228 DEKlaGs in OSCC. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses suggested that DEKlaGs contributed to inflammatory and cancer progression. A Cox model in accordance with BCAM, CGNL1, DGKG, and OLR1 could predict OSCC patient prognosis accurately. Subsequently, Kla-induced prognostic genes were identified to play a crucial role in OSCC drug therapy and TME. Moreover, BCAM was identified as a biomarker that promoted OSCC invasion, angiogenesis, and chemotherapy resistance. CONCLUSION: Kla was identified to be associated with OSCC prognosis, drug therapy, and TME. Histone Kla-induced BCAM was identified to play a crucial role during OSCC progression, suggesting that Kla is promising to be a novel therapeutic target for OSCC.",

      "abstract": "Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1A) is a pivotal epigenetic enzyme that contributes to several malignancies including malignant glioma. LSD1 is a flavin adenine dinucleotide dependent histone demethylase that specifically targets histone H3 lysine (K) 4 mono- (me1) and di-methylation (me2) and H3K9me1/2 for demethylation. Herein we report the development of an LSD inhibitor, S2172, which efficiently penetrates the blood-brain barrier. S2172 effectively suppresses LSD1 enzymatic activity, resulting in the depletion of cell growth both in vitro in glioma stem cells (GSCs) (mean half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 13.8 μM) and in vivo in a GSC orthotopic xenograft mouse model. Treatment with S2172 robustly reduced the expression of the stemness-related genes MYC and Nestin in GSC cells. Consistent with this, chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing revealed a significant S2172-dependent alteration in H3K4me2/H3K4me3 status. Furthermore, we identified 284 newly acquired H3K4me2 peak regions after S2172 treatment, which were encompassed within super-enhancer regions. The altered H3K4me2/H3K4me3 status induced by S2172 treatment affected the expression of genes related to tumorigenesis. Our data suggest that targeting LSD1 with S2172 could provide a promising treatment option for glioblastomas, particularly due to targeting of GSC populations.",

Here, we identified isoforsythiaside (IFA), a natural phenylpropanoid glycoside isolated from Forsythia suspensa, as a novel covalent inhibitor of LSD1. The target ligand fishing technique and LC-MS/MS analysis identified that IFA could covalently bind to the Ser817 residue of LSD1 by α,β-unsaturated ketone moiety to block the amine oxidase-like domain of LSD1. Moreover, RBMS3/Twist1/MMP2, the downstream signaling pathway of LSD1, was activated after IFA treatment to inhibit the metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro and in vivo.

It has been reported in previous studies that the kidney injury caused by F-RVCZ is 1% or less. METHODS: Serum creatinine levels were compared, and glomerular filtration rate and urine protein were estimated before and after starting the administration of F-RVCZ, as well as after the end of the administration period. The cause of kidney injury was investigated using renal pathology, and risk factors were also investigated. RESULTS: F-RVCZ was administered to 46 patients. Ten of these patients were excluded because three were maintenance dialysis patients and seven were not measured for serum creatinine. Remaining 36 patients were included in the analyses. Kidney injury occurred in 27.8% of patients treated with F-RVCZ; this condition persisted in 10% of patients after the end of the administration period. No changes were observed in the urinalysis after the administration of F-RVCZ. A kidney biopsy was performed in one patient, but no lesions were found that could be the cause of kidney injury. Patients who developed kidney injury were significantly more likely to be receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (odds ratio 18.9, 95% confidential interval: 1.69-210, p = 0.0169). CONCLUSION: Kidney injury is caused by F-RVCZ more frequently than previously reported, but the mechanism remains unclear.",

      "abstract": "Lysine deacetylases (KDACs or HDACs) are metal-dependent enzymes that regulate lysine acetylation, a post-translational modification that is present on thousands of human proteins, essential for many cellular processes, and often misregulated in diseases. The selective inhibition of KDACs would allow for understanding of the biological roles of individual KDACs and therapeutic targeting of individual enzymes. Recent studies have suggested that purportedly specific KDAC inhibitors have significant off-target binding, but the biological consequences of off-target binding were not evaluated. We compared the effects of treatment with two of the reportedly most KDAC-selective inhibitors, Tubastatin A and PCI-34051, in HT1080 cells in which the endogenous KDAC6 or KDAC8 gene has been mutated to inactivate enzyme catalysis while retaining enzyme expression. Genetic inactivation results in much stronger deacetylation defects on known targets compared to inhibitor treatment. Gene expression analysis revealed that both inhibitors have extensive and extensively overlapping off-target effects in cells, even at low inhibitor doses. Furthermore, Tubastatin A treatment led to increased histone acetylation, while inactivation of KDAC6 or KDAC8 did not. Genetic inactivation of KDAC6, but not KDAC8, impaired tumor formation in a xenograft model system, in contrast to previous reports with KDAC inhibitors suggesting the reverse. We conclude that the majority of observed biological effects of treatment with KDAC inhibitors are due to off-target effects rather than the intended KDAC inhibition. Developing a truly specific KDAC6 inhibitor could be a promising therapeutic avenue, but it is imperative to develop new inhibitors that selectively mimic genetic inactivation of individual KDACs.",

      "abstract": "To investigate the differences in serum tryptophan, lysine, and phenylalanine levels in breast cancer patients, the correlation between the three amino acids with the chemotherapy regimen, and their significance in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.Clinical data were collected from the Department of Breast Surgery at Yunnan Cancer Hospital, encompassing 216 cases from July to December 2020, including 91 healthy individuals, 38 with benign tumors, and 87 with cancer. Amino acid levels were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Statistical analyses, such as the Kruskal-Wallis H-test and Wilcoxon test, were conducted to compare the levels of these amino acids across the healthy group, benign tumor group, and breast cancer group. The χ2 test and Fisher's exact probability method were employed to assess the relationship between amino acid levels and breast cancer stage, grade, and chemotherapy regimen.The results indicated that there were significant differences in serum lysine (H = 36.13, P < .001) and phenylalanine (H = 34.03, P < .001) levels among the three groups. However, tryptophan levels did not show statistically significant variances. Specifically, lysine and phenylalanine levels were significantly different when comparing the healthy group with the breast cancer group and the benign tumor group with the breast cancer group. These differences were not significant when comparing the healthy group with the benign tumor group. Furthermore, there were no statistically significant distinctions observed in lysine (F = 0.836, P > .05) and phenylalanine (F = 1.466, P > .05) levels across different conventional chemotherapy regimens among the breast cancer cases studied.Serum lysine and phenylalanine levels might serve as potential biomarkers for breast cancer, and the choice of chemotherapy regimen is unlikely to impact significant changes in these amino acid levels.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epigenetic dysregulation affecting oncogenic transcription and DNA damage response is a hallmark of cancer. The histone demethylase KDM4B, a factor regulating these processes, plays important roles in estrogen receptor-mediated transcription and DNA repair in breast cancer. However, how oncogenic phospho-signal transduction affects epigenetic regulation is not fully understood. Here we found that KDM4B phosphorylation by ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), a downstream effector of the Ras/MAPK pathway, is critical for the function of KDM4B in response to DNA damage. METHODS: KDM4B-knockout breast cancer cell lines were generated via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. Re-expression of wild-type or phospho-site mutated KDM4B in knockout cells was performed by lentivirus-mediated gene transfer. Gene knockdown was achieved by RNA interference. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) were induced by ionizing radiation or laser-microirradiation. Protein accumulation at DSB sites was analyzed by immunofluorescence. KDM4B phosphorylation by RSK was assessed by in vitro and in vivo kinase assays. Gene and protein expression levels were analyzed by RT‒PCR and western blotting. The sensitivity of cells to ionizing radiation was examined by a clonogenic survival assay. RESULTS: RSK phosphorylated KDM4B at Ser666, and inhibition of the phosphorylation by RSK depletion or RSK inhibitors abrogated KDM4B accumulation at the sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). DSB repair was significantly delayed in KDM4B-knockout cells or cells treated with RSK inhibitors. The replacement of endogenous KDM4B with the phosphomimetic mutant S666D restored KDM4B accumulation and DSB repair that had been inhibited by RSK inhibitors, suggesting a critical role for RSK at the specific serine residue of KDM4B in the effect of RSK inhibitors on DSB repair. As a consequence of these aberrant responses, inhibition of KDM4B phosphorylation increased the sensitivity of the cells to ionizing radiation. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the present study uncovered a novel function of RSK on the DNA damage response, which provides an additional role of its inhibitor in cancer therapy.",

The mature cell-surface PrPC is internalized and subsequently degraded by lysosomes. Although, proteasomes are proposed to be involved, the precise mechanism of PrPC degradation remains uncertain. Given that proteins are ubiquitinated primarily on lysine residues, we sought to determine whether lysine residues within PrPC are involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of PrPC. We generated a plasmid vector expressing a mutant PrPC (called lysine-null PrPC) in which all lysine residues were replaced with arginine residues. Subsequently, we established stably transformed cell lines (designated HpL2-1 PrP-WT and HpL2-1 PrP-K/R, respectively) using the mouse PrPC-deficient neuronal cell line (HpL2-1) and plasmids expressing wild-type (WT) or lysine-null PrPC (PrP-K/R). We found that HpL2-1 PrP-WT and HpL2-1 PrP-K/R cells correctly expressed their respective PrPC which translocated efficiently to the plasma membrane. Subsequently, using immunoblotting and confocal microscopy, we found that treatment with cycloheximide (CHX; a protein synthesis inhibitor) significantly reduced PrPC expression in both these transformed cell lines, indicating that WT and lysine-null PrPC are degraded similarly. Taken together, these results indicate that the lysine residues of PrPC do not regulate its degradation.",

Clinically viable therapies targeting the activities of histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMT) and demethylases (HKDMs) have only recently begun to emerge following FDA approval of the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat in 2020 and remain limited to compounds targeting the well-studied SET domain-containing HKMTs and their opposing HKDMs. These include the H3K27 methyltransferases EZH2/EZH1, the singular H3K79 methyltransferase DOT1L, and the H3K4 methyltransferase MLL1/COMPASS as well as H3K9 and H3K36 methyltransferases. They additionally include the H3K4/9-preferential demethylase LSD1 and the H3K4-, H3K27-, and H3K36-preferential KDM5, KDM6, and KDM2 demethylase subfamilies, respectively. This Review discusses the results of recent clinical and preclinical studies relevant to all of these existing and potential therapies. It provides an update on advancements in therapeutic development, as well as more basic molecular understanding, within the past 5 years approximately. It also offers a perspective on histone lysine methylation that departs from the long-predominant \"histone code\" metaphor, emphasizing complex-disrupting inhibitors and proximity-based approaches rather than catalytic domain inhibitors in the outlook for future therapeutic development.",

However, the relationship between the secondary structure of proteins and their emulsifying ability has not been further investigated. This study used the addition of three different amino acids to influence the interaction between zein chains, which may induce changes in the secondary structure of the prepared zein complex particles. This study demonstrates that the emulsifying properties of proteins, such as dispersibility, zeta potential, three-phase contact angles, interfacial affinity, adsorption rates, and the volume of the stabilized oil phase, are closely related to the β-sheet content of the complex particles, providing a theoretical reference for protein-based stabilizers. Additionally, amino acids, as the blocks of proteins, have high compatibility with proteins, and using amino acids as modifiers aligns with the safety requirements for food processing. In this study, the prepared zein-lysine complex particles have good emulsifying ability, capable of stabilizing a 50 (v/v)% emulsion at a lower concentration (10 mg mL-1), and the prepared emulsion exhibits high-temperature stability and ionic resistance. This characteristic makes the emulsion potentially valuable for application in systems with high salt concentrations and those that may undergo heat treatment.",

      "abstract": "Lysine acylations are ubiquitous and structurally diverse post-translational modifications that vastly expand the functional heterogeneity of the human proteome. Hence, the targeted acylation of lysine residues has emerged as a strategic approach to exert biomimetic control over the protein function. However, existing strategies for targeted lysine acylation in cells often rely on genetic intervention, recruitment of endogenous acylation machinery, or nonspecific acylating agents and lack methods to quantify the magnitude of specific acylations on a global level. In this study, we develop activity-based acylome profiling (ABAP), a chemoproteomic strategy that exploits elaborate N-(cyanomethyl)-N-(phenylsulfonyl)amides and lysine-centric probes for site-specific introduction and proteome-wide mapping of posttranslational lysine acylations in human cells. Harnessing this framework, we quantify various artificial acylations and rediscover numerous endogenous lysine acylations. We validate site-specific acetylation of target lysines and establish a structure-activity relationship for N-(cyanomethyl)-N-(phenylsulfonyl)amides in proteins from diverse structural and functional classes. We identify paralog-selective chemical probes that acetylate conserved lysines within interferon-stimulated antiviral RNA-binding proteins, generating de novo proteoforms with obstructed RNA interactions. We further demonstrate that targeted acetylation of a key enzyme in retinoid metabolism engenders a proteoform with a conformational change in the protein structure, leading to a gain-of-function phenotype and reduced drug potency. These findings underscore the versatility of our strategy in biomimetic control over protein function through targeted delivery and global profiling of endogenous and artificial lysine acylations, potentially advancing therapeutic modalities and our understanding of biological processes orchestrated by these post-translational modifications.",

We and others have found that STAT3 directly regulates pro-fibrotic signaling in the kidney. The STAT3 protein-protein interaction plays an important role in activating its transcriptional activity. It is necessary to identify these interactions to investigate their function in kidney disease. Here, we investigated the protein-protein interaction among three species to find crucial interactions that can be targeted to alleviate kidney disease. METHOD: In this study, we examined common protein-protein interactions leading to the activation or downregulation of STAT3 among three different species: humans (Homo sapiens), mice (Mus musculus), and rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Further, we chose to investigate the P300 and STAT3 interaction and performed studies of the activation of STAT3 using IL-6 and inhibition of the P300 by its specific inhibitor A-485 in pericytes. Next, we performed immunoprecipitation to confirm whether A-485 inhibits the binding of P300 to STAT3. RESULTS: Using the STRING application from ExPASy, we found that six proteins, including PIAS3, JAK1, JAK2, EGFR, SRC, and EP300, showed highly confident interactions with STAT3 in humans, mice, and rabbits. We also found that IL-6 treatment increased the acetylation of STAT3 and increased histone 3 lysine acetylation (H3K27ac). Furthermore, we found that the disruption of STAT3 and P300 interaction by the P300 inhibitor A-485 decreased STAT3 acetylation and H3K27ac. Finally, we confirmed that the P300 inhibitor A-485 inhibited the binding of STAT3 with P300, which inhibited its transcriptional activity by reducing the expression of Ccnd1 (Cyclin D1). CONCLUSIONS: Targeting the P300 protein interaction with STAT3 may alleviate STAT3-mediated fibrotic signaling in humans and other species."

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the optimal SID Arg: Lys ratio for maximizing the reproductive performance, immunity and biochemical parameters of sows during gestation, the colostrum composition, and the performance of their offspring. A total of 174 multiparous sows were randomly allocated to five treatment groups varying in dietary SID Arg: Lys ratios (0.91, 1.02, 1.14, 1.25 and 1.38) through modification of the levels of Arg or alanine supplementation (the total level of nitrogen was the same in all treatments). The results showed that increasing the dietary SID Arg: Lys ratio increased the number of piglets born alive (p < 0.05, linear and quadratic). The number of stillborn piglets, the birth weight variation of born alive piglets, the birth interval (p < 0.05, linear and quadratic) and the number of mummies (p < 0.05, quadratic) reduced with increasing the dietary SID Arg: Lys ratio. Broken-line regression analysis indicated that the optimal SID Arg: Lys ratio requirement for gestating sows to maximize the number of piglets born alive was 1.25. The content of non-fat solid, total solid, protein, and energy in colostrum increased linearly and quadratically (p < 0.05) with increasing dietary SID Arg: Lys ratio. Additionally, when increasing the dietary SID Arg: Lys ratio, the concentration of IgA (p < 0.05, quadratic) and IgM (p < 0.05, linear and quadratic) of plasma increased at day 90 of gestation; IgG (p < 0.05, linear and quadratic) concentration increased at day 110 of gestation of sows. The dietary SID Arg: Lys ratio had an increasing effect (p < 0.05, linear and quadratic) on plasma insulin levels at day 90 of gestation. Furthermore, there were increases in plasma concentrations of nitric oxide and ornithine at day 110 of gestation, Arg at day 90 and 110 of gestation (p < 0.05, linear and quadratic) and total protein at day 110 of gestation (p < 0.05, linear) with increasing dietary SID Arg: Lys ratio. The results of our study indicated that increases in the dietary SID Arg: Lys ratio during gestation resulted in an increase in the number of piglets born alive, a decrease in birth intervals, and an improvement in immunity and colostrum composition. The optimal SID Arg: Lys ratio for gestating sows to maximize the number of piglets born alive was 1.25."

      "abstract": "Chestnut inner shell, cinnamon, and ε-poly-lysine (ε-PL) have been used for natural preservative of food grade, and combined preservatives (CP) has been formulated previously. This study examined whether Staphylococcus aureus growth could be controlled using CP in tryptic soy broth (TSB). CP inhibited S. aureus growth by about 5 log CFU/mL in TSB. The cell surface hydrophobicity, autoaggregation, and motility of S. aureus were slightly reduced by CP treatment. The expression of adhesion- and toxin-related genes in S. aureus treated with CP was reduced than that in the control treated with TSB. In addition, the inhibitory activity of the CP was visible through the SEM images. Therefore, the CP consisted of chestnut inner shell extract, cinnamon extract, and ε-PL had appropriate antibacterial effect against S. aureus and could be applied as antibacterial agents."

      "abstract": "Temozolomide (TMZ) is the first-line chemotherapeutic agent for malignant glioma, but its resistance limited the benefits of the treated patients. In this study, the role and significance of trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) in TMZ resistance were investigated. Data from twenty advanced glioma patients were collected, and their pathological samples were analyzed for H3K27me3 levels. TMZ sensitivity was compared between glioma cells U87 and TMZ-resistant cells U87TR, with H3K27me3 levels determined in both cells. The effects of H3K27me3 demethylases inhibitor GSK-J4, combined with TMZ, were assessed on the proliferation and migration of U87TR cells. The results indicated that a high level of H3K27me3 predicts longer disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in glioma patients receiving TMZ treatment. The H3K27me3 level was lower in U87TR cells compared to U87 cells. GSK-J4 increased the H3K27me3 level in U87TR cells and decreased their resistance to TMZ. In summary, this study identified a novel marker of TMZ resistance in glioma and provided a new strategy to address this challenge. These findings are significant for improving the clinical treatment of glioma in the future.",

      "abstract": "AIM: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignancy in the gastrointestinal tract. The main objective of this study is to explore the potential mechanisms of E74-like factor 4 (ELF4) in CRC progression, providing a novel therapeutic target for CRC treatment. METHODS: CRC cells and normal control cells were cultured. Levels of ELF4/long non-coding RNA integrin subunit beta 8 antisense RNA 1 (LncRNA ITGB8-AS1)/claudin-23 (CLDN23) were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction or Western blot assay. ELF4 siRNA, ITGB8-AS1 pcDNA3.1, or CLDN23 siRNA were transfected into cells. Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were evaluated. The enrichment of ELF4 on the ITGB8-AS1 promoter was detected. Dual-luciferase assay was employed to assess the binding between ELF4 and the ITGB8-AS1 promoter. RNA pull-down and RNA immunoprecipitation assays were conducted to investigate the binding between ITGB8-AS1 and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2). The binding of EZH2 and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) to the CLDN23 promoter was detected. RESULTS: ELF4 and ITGB8-AS1 were upregulated in CRC cells, while CLDN23 was downregulated. Knockdown of ELF4 inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. Mechanistically, ELF4 transcriptionally activated ITGB8-AS1 and promoted the binding between ITGB8-AS1 and EZH2. EZH2 catalyzed H3K27me3 modification on the CLDN23 promoter, leading to decreased CLDN23 expression. Overexpression of ITGB8-AS1 or downregulation of CLDN23 could reduce the inhibitory effects of silencing ELF4 on CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. CONCLUSION: ELF4 accelerates CRC progression through the ITGB8-AS1/CLDN23 axis, providing new therapeutic targets for CRC.",

      "abstract": "Two experiments evaluated the effects of precision feeding standardized ileal digestible (SID) Lys during lactation. Sows were blocked by parity and allotted to treatment on day 2 of lactation. In both experiments, sow body weight (BW), backfat (BF), loin depth (LD), and estimated N excretion were evaluated as well as litter growth performance. In experiment 1, 95 sows and litters were used. Three dietary treatments were provided using 2 diets: a low (0.25% SID Lys) and high Lys diet (1.10% SID Lys). Treatments included a control diet (1.10% SID Lys) fed throughout lactation, and NRC or INRA treatment curves for Lys intake. Sows fed NRC or INRA treatment curves received blends of low and high Lys diets using a computerized lactation feeder (Gestal Quattro Opti Feeder, Jyga Technologies, St-Lambert-de-Lauzon, Quebec, CA) to target a specific Lys intake each day of lactation based on NRC and INRA models for parity and litter size. In experiment 2, 56 sows and litters were used with 3 treatments, a control diet (1.10% SID Lys fed throughout lactation) and either a static or dynamic blend curve. For both curve treatments, low (0.40% SID Lys) and high Lys (1.10% SID Lys) diets were blended to reach target Lys intake. The difference between the static and dynamic curves was that the dynamic curves were adjusted based on actual Lys intake and static curves were not. Lysine intake curves were based on NRC model estimates, but targets were increased by 20% to target average Lys intake of 60 g/d across parities based on results of experiment 1. In both experiments, no differences (P > 0.05) in sow average daily feed intake or sow BW, BF, or LD change were observed. Sows fed the control diets had greater Lys intake (grams per day; P < 0.05) compared to sows fed either of the blended treatment curves. In experiment 1, pigs from sows fed the control diet had greater (P < 0.05) BW at weaning and preweaning average daily gain (ADG) compared to sows fed the INRA treatment curve, with pigs from sows fed the NRC treatment curve intermediate. However, in experiment 2, no differences (P > 0.05) were observed in pig weight at weaning or ADG. In both experiments, sows fed the blended treatment curves had lower (P < 0.05) calculated N excretion. In summary, for a litter size of 13.5 weaned pigs, 60 g/d of SID Lys is sufficient to maximize litter weight gain and can be achieved through blending low and high Lys diets. Precision feeding reduced N excretion compared to feeding a single diet throughout lactation.",
