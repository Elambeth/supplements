      "abstract": "The present study was designed to characterize the interactions between lecithin liposomes, a model membrane, and either β-carotene or tamoxifen. In addition, the cytotoxicity of liposomal beta-carotene with tamoxifen was screened in vitro in human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 in addition to the normal WI38 cell line. All liposomes were nearly spherical and evenly distributed and had fewer aggregates for encapsulated and empty vesicles. Measurements using dynamic light scattering verified that each sample was monodisperse. When tamoxifen is incorporated into liposomal membranes, the zeta potential values tend to decrease. In the test for cytotoxicity using MCF-7 treated cells, the liposomal β-carotene IC50 value was at least 0.45 μg/mL, whereas the IC50 of free β-carotene treated cells was 7.8 μg/mL. For MCF-7 treated cells treated with free tamoxifen, the IC50 was 9.92 μg/mL, but for its liposomal form, it was 20.88 μg/mL. According to the cytotoxicity test using MDA-MB-231 treated cells, the IC50 values for free tamoxifen, free β-carotene, liposomal β-carotene, liposomal tamoxifen, and liposomal tamoxifen β-carotene were 15.5 μg/mL, 38.1 μg/mL, 12.1 μg/mL, 21.2 μg/mL, and 11.4 μg/mL, respectively. This investigation demonstrated that free β-carotene has a more potent cytotoxic impact than tamoxifen. The findings showed that each comet assay variable for the liposomal β-carotene was significantly (p < 0.05) elevated in comparison with tamoxifen and control values. Analysis using flow cytometry revealed that the MCF-7 cells displayed a greater degree of cell apoptosis than the control cells following a 48 h exposure to liposomal β-carotene. Based on available data, a novel treatment plan that includes liposomal β-carotene may boost antitumor activity toward the MCF-7 cancer cell line. The current findings demonstrated that preparations of natural products might be a good substitute for pharmaceutical interventions in the treatment of breast cancer.",

      "abstract": "Sows and piglets face heightened oxidative stress during gestation and lactation, yet strategies to simultaneously mitigate these challenges remain underexplored. This study investigated the effects of β-carotene and superoxide dismutase (SOD) supplementation on 140 Landrace × Yorkshire sows (parity 3-5) randomly assigned to (1) a control; (2) long-term low-dose treatment (25 mg/kg β-carotene, 4 mg/kg SOD, or both) throughout gestation-lactation; or (3) short-term high-dose treatment (100 mg/kg β-carotene, 14 mg/kg SOD, or both) administered 7 days pre/post-weaning and farrowing. Our data indicate that the antioxidants enhanced the productive performance of both sows and piglets, with the most pronounced effect observed in the long-term, low-dose combined administration of β-carotene and SOD. The composite antioxidants significantly improved the systemic antioxidant capacity in sows, while concurrently reducing the cortisol and lipopolysaccharide concentrations in the serum. This enhancement contributed to elevations in serum progesterone and prolactin levels at day 40 of gestation and farrowing, respectively, ultimately increasing the number of weaned piglets and decreasing the backfat loss. In addition, the compound antioxidants improved the serum antioxidant indices of piglets, increased the growth hormone concentrations, and improved the litter weight gain. Mechanistically, the placental upregulation of CAT, GPX1, and GLUT3, alongside Claudin1, Occludin, and ZO-1 expression, underpinned improved nutrient transport and barrier function. These findings demonstrate that β-carotene and SOD synergistically transfer antioxidant capacity via placental and colostrum pathways, offering a viable strategy for integrated sow-piglet management."

      "abstract": "An 8-week feeding experiment was carried out to determine the influence of β-carotene intake on the growth, biochemical, and immunological responses of Macrobrachium nipponense. Five distinct formulated nutritional regimens were fed to prawns with an average weight of 1.37 ± 0.09 g, each containing varying levels of β-carotene, including 0 (control), 50, 100, 150, and 200 mg/kg. According to the results, the growth metrics were markedly increased by the various levels of β-carotene (p < 0.05); however, the hepatosomatic index (HSI) remained statistically unchanged compared to the control treatment (p > 0.05). Despite that, a reduction was observed in most hemolymph biochemical indicators, including triglycerides, urea, creatinine, and uric acid (p < 0.05). Conversely, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels demonstrated a notable increase in comparison to the control group (p < 0.05). Moreover, the levels of calcium, phosphorus, and cholesterol did not exhibit any noteworthy differences (p > 0.05). The administration of β-carotene resulted in a significant reduction of hemato-immune indices, including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and cortisol (CORT) levels. Conversely, there was a notable increase in the levels of lysozyme (LYZ), albumin (ALB), phenoloxidase (PO), total protein (TP), hyaline cells (HCs), granular cells (GCs), semi-GCs (SGCs), and total hemocyte count (THC) within the β-carotene treatment groups (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the majority of the hepatopancreatic antioxidant parameters, including malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD), exhibited a significant decrease in response to β-carotene treatment. However, the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) demonstrated a marked increase when compared to the control treatment (p < 0.05). Nonetheless, the levels of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and alkaline phosphatase (AKP) did not exhibit any significant changes by these experimental treatments (p > 0.05). The research revealed that elevated dietary levels of β-carotene, specifically at 200 mg/kg, significantly increased digestive enzyme activities, total carotenoid content (TCC), and body chemical composition, including crude protein and crude lipid levels (p < 0.05). Despite the β-carotene supplementation, the populations of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and ash content remained unaffected (p > 0.05). Notably, an increase in the levels of β-carotene corresponded with a significant elevation in the expression of genes related to growth and immunity (p < 0.05). An elevation in dietary β-carotene significantly increased polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and essential amino acids (EAAs) compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Eventually, the present research results indicate that the incorporation of 200 mg/kg β-carotene pigment into dietary of the oriental river prawn positively influences the growth indices, hematological, immunological, and metabolic responses of this prawn species."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a progressive, age-related degenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of calcium deposits in the aortic valve. We aim to screen key genes associated with cellular senescence (CS) in CAVD. METHODS: The GSE12644 and GSE51472 datasets from the GEO database was utilized in this study, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the \"limma\" R package. CS-related DEGs (CS-DEGs) were determined through the CellAge database. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed on CS-DEGs. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the STRING database. The cytoHubba plug-in in Cytoscape was used to identify hub genes. A noncoding-RNA-mRNA regulatory network was established. DSigDB database was used to to identify drugs potentially be useful for treating CAVD. RESULTS: A total of 16 CS-DEGs were identified. These genes were primarily associated with collagen metabolic process, collagen catabolic process and external side of plasma membrane. 10 hub genes were identified as regulators of cellular senescence in CAVD: LPAR1, PTPN6, CD28, ID1, MEIS2, FGFR3, KDR, MMP7, AR, HIF1A. The Noncoding RNA-mRNA regulatory network indicated that CS-DEGs may be regulated by noncoding RNAs. β-Carotene, a naturally occurring carotenoid with antioxidant properties, was identified potential therapeutic agents through interacting with MMP9, MEIS2, and CTSB. CONCLUSION: This study provides insights into the key genes and pathways related to cellular senescence in CAVD (MMP9, MEIS2, and CTSB) and highlights the potential role of β-Carotene treatment of CAVD.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: β-carotene, a vitamin A precursor is reported to inhibit molecular pathways cardinal to pathogenesis of fibrotic tissue alterations and in this study, the effectiveness of 14 days oral administration of β-carotene (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg/day) in the cardiac fibrosis (CF) in rats was studied and explored the mechanisms through network pharmacology. METHODS: CF was induced by isoproterenol (ISO) 6 mg/kg/SC from day 1 to day 7. Losartan (LOS) 10 mg/kg/day/p.o. served as the standard. Both β-carotene and LOS were administered from day 1 to 14. On the 15th day, ECG and blood pressure (systolic, diastolic and mean) were recorded in the anesthetized rats followed by their euthanasia. The extent of cardiac fibrosis in the isolated hearts was determined using heart coefficient, tissue levels of hydroxyproline, histological examination. The oxidative stress in cardiac tissue was estimated, as GSH, SOD, catalase, MDA and NO. β-carotene targeted proteins pathway, process, and functional enrichment analysis were explored through network pharmacology. RESULTS: β-carotene dose-dependently mitigated the biochemical and histological changes induced by ISO in heart tissues. In ECG, it restored ST height, QT, and QRS intervals. Additionally, it normalized systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures. The reduction in heart coefficient suggests β-carotene's potential to inhibit collagen deposition in heart tissue. β-carotene normalized oxidative stress markers, and hydroxyproline levels. All other biochemical parameters were restored to normal levels with β-carotene treatment. β-carotene 40 mg/kg dose showed comparable effect to that of LOS 10 mg/kg. β-carotene modulated IL-17, TNF, NF-kappa B, HIF-1, Sphingolipid, Relaxin, Adipocytokine, cAMP, Toll-like receptor, MAPK, PI3K-Akt, cGMP-PKG, VEGF, Ras, and PPAR signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: β-carotene dose-dependently protects against ISO-induced CF in rats, with 40 mg/kg as an effective antifibrotic dose."

      "abstract": "Dunaliella salina is an important source of natural β-carotene (containing 9-cis and all trans isomers) for industrial production. The phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) has been proven to have impacts on the stress resistance of higher plants, but research on microalgae is currently unclear. In this study, the effects of SA on the growth, biochemical composition, antioxidant enzyme activity, key enzymes of β-carotene synthesis, and cis-and trans-isomers of β-carotene in D. salina under different salt concentrations were investigated. The results were shown that at concentrations of 1.5, 2, and 2.5 M NaCl, the antioxidant enzyme activity and key enzymes for β-carotene synthesis in algal cells were significantly increased, but the content and proportion of 9-cis isomer in β-carotene isomers decreased. The addition of SA significantly increased the growth and antioxidant enzyme (SOD, MDA) activity, as well as the synthesis of key enzyme phytoene synthase (PSY), phytoene desaturase (PDS), and lycopene β cyclase (LCYB) of D. salina under high-salinity conditions. It is worth noting that under the treatment of SA, the proportion of 9-cis isomer in the three salt concentrations (1.5, 2, 2.5 M NaCl) significantly increased by 32.09%, 20.30%, and 11.32%, respectively. Moreover, SA can not only improve the salt tolerance of D. salina, but also increase the proportion of 9-cis isomer, with higher physiological activity in β-carotene, thereby enhancing the application value of D. salina.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim was to ascertain whether serum carotenoid levels are linked to suicidal ideation, along with how depressive disorder influences the association. METHODS: This research was conducted using a cross-sectional design and encompassed 7,335 adults from the United States. The levels of serum carotenoids, encompassing α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, and lutein/zeaxanthin, were ascertained by employing high-performance liquid chromatography. Item nine of the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire was used to evaluate suicidal ideation. The study used multivariable-adjusted logistic regression and restricted cubic spline models to ascertain the link between serum carotenoid levels and suicidal ideation. Mediation and stratified analyses were used to ascertain the impact of depressed symptoms on the association between serum carotenoid levels and suicidal ideation. RESULTS: Out of the total participants, 245 individuals (3.3%) reported having suicidal ideation. Participants who had suicidal ideation showed lower levels of serum α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, and lutein/zeaxanthin compared to those who did not have suicidal ideation. After controlling potential confounding factors, serum β-carotene level was still associated with risk of suicidal ideation (per 1-standard deviation (SD) increment, odds ratio [OR]: 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.55-0.98). The mediation analysis revealed that 36.3% of this association was mediated by the severity of depressive symptoms. Stratified analysis manifested that the association remained in depressed people but was attenuated in people without depressive disorder. CONCLUSION: Increased serum β-carotene level may decrease the susceptibility to suicidal ideation, especially in depressed people. Further intervention studies are needed to validate whether β-carotene consumption contributes to preventing suicidal ideation."

This study synthesizes and characterizes beta-carotene-coated ZnO NPs (BT-ZnO NPs) for potential anti-cancer and antimicrobial applications, demonstrating significant efficacy against dental pathogens and oral cancer cells. Scanning Electron Microscopy, EDAX, UV, FTIR, XRD, and Zeta potential analysis of prepared BT-ZnO NPs revealed uniform flower-like crystalline structures with intricate morphology and an average particle size of 38.06 nm. FTIR spectra identified various functional groups, suggesting a complex organic compound coated with ZnO NPs. Zeta potential measurements showed pH-dependent surface charge variations, which are crucial for understanding colloidal stability. The antimicrobial activity was potent against dental pathogens, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 50 µg/mL highlighting significant inhibition. Molecular docking studies demonstrated strong binding affinities of BT to key receptor proteins of dental pathogens. BT-ZnO NPs exhibited notable antioxidant activity of 68%, comparable to ascorbic acid, and significant anti-inflammatory effects of 75.1% at 100 µg/mL. Cytotoxicity assays indicated a concentration-dependent suppression of KB cell proliferation, decreasing cell viability to 37.19%, and gene expression studies showed elevated P53 expression, suggesting a strong apoptotic response. These multifaceted properties underscore the potential of BT-ZnO NPs as an integrated therapeutic approach for dental healthcare and oncology.",

      "abstract": "Dry eye disease (DED) is a multifactorial ocular disease, the core mechanism of which is the tear film instability caused by ocular oxidative stress damage and inflammation. Although various pharmaceutical agents are available for DED treatment, their effectiveness is often limited by the eyes' unique biological barriers, and the long-term use of steroid hormones can lead to several adverse effects. This study reported a nano-supramolecular delivery system consisting of a polycyclodextrin (PCD), hyaluronic acid (HA) and the natural compound β-carotene (BC) for the DED treatment. Our findings indicate that the HA/PCD@BC eye drops effectively distribute on the ocular surface, retain BC, and significantly enhance the corneal penetration of BC. The excellent biocompatibility of HA/PCD@BC was demonstrated through viability testing on different cell lines, the Draize eye test, as well as the hematoxylin-eosin staining (H&E) sections of cornea and conjunctiva. Both in vitro oxidative stress assays and in vivo DED model evaluations demonstrated that the HA/PCD@BC delivery system significantly reduced abnormal oxidative stress levels on the ocular surface, inhibited the secretion of inflammatory factors, and increased the secretion of tear film stabilizing mucin. These effects collectively improved pathological changes in eye tissues and minimized damage to the ocular surface. It is of particular importance to note that HA/PCD@BC eye drops showed superior efficacy in comparison to cyclosporine A (CsA), an FDA-approved first-line drug. To sum up, the HA/PCD@BC nanodelivery system provides a natural, safe and effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of DED and various ocular diseases.",

This study investigates the impact of β-carotene on biochemical parameters and pancreatic insulin expression in mice exposed to ethanol. METHODS: Thirty-six C57BL/6 mice (Mus musculus) were divided into six groups: 1. C (control), 2. LA (3% alcohol dose), 3. MA (7% alcohol dose), 4. B (0.52 mg/kg body weight/day β-carotene), 5. LA+B (3% alcohol dose + 0.52 mg/kg body weight/day β-carotene), and 6. MA+B (7% alcohol dose plus 0.52 mg/kg body weight/day β-carotene). After 28 days, the animals were euthanized for serum and pancreatic tissue collection. Biochemical analysis and pancreatic insulin expression were performed. One-way ANOVA was used. RESULTS: The B, LA+B, and MA+B groups improved insulin levels and decreased HOMA-β versus the C group, with the LA+B and MA+B groups also showing lower ADH and ALDH levels than their nonsupplemented counterparts (p < 0.05). The B, LA+B, and MA+B groups showed a greater β-cell mass area compared to the unsupplemented groups. Additionally, the LA+B and MA+B groups demonstrated significantly increased β-cell area and integrated optical density compared to the LA and MA groups, respectively (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In mice, β-cell loss led to increased glucose release due to decreased insulin levels. β-carotene appeared to mitigate ethanol's impact on these cells, resulting in reduced insulin degradation when integrated optical density was used. These findings suggest that antioxidant supplementation may be beneficial in treating ethanol-induced type 2 diabetes in animal models."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite causing significant tissue damage at the molecular and cellular levels, partly due to its induction of oxidative stress, it remains of interest in medical applications. Beta-carotene, found in fruits and vegetables, is being studied for its antioxidant properties. This study aimed to explore beta-carotene's protective effects against gentamicin-induced hepatorenal toxicity. METHOD: Thirty male Wistar-rats were divided into five groups. Control group received normal-saline, while the canola group received canola oil (beta-carotene solvent). Gentamicin group received 100 mg/kg gentamicin injections for seven days. Beta-carotene groups were treated with beta-carotene at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg for 10 days, along with gentamicin from the fourth day for 7 days. Serum and tissue hepatorenal function tests were performed at the end of the study. RESULTS: Gentamicin resulted in hepatorenal damage. Beta-carotene alongside gentamicin significantly decreased serum SGOT (152.3 ± 12.7 vs. 264.8 ± 9.3 IU/L), SGPT (65.7 ± 2.5 vs. 98.0 ± 4.8 IU/L), creatinine (0.74 ± 0.0 vs. 1.5 ± 0.1 mg/dL), and urea (78.1 ± 10.7 vs. 207.4 ± 23.6 mg/dL) in comparison to gentamicin alone (p < 0.05). Beta-carotene caused a significant decrease in vacuolar degeneration, interstitial nephritis and infiltration of lymphocytes in kidney, and cell necrosis, vacuolar degeneration and infiltration of leukocytes compared to the gentamicin group; additionally, beta-carotene prevented increase in oxidative stress in gentamicin group. CONCLUSION: Administration of gentamicin alone resulted in hepatorenal toxicity, whereas beta-carotene could prevent gentamicin-induced oxidative stress imbalance and tissue damage. Therefore, beta-carotene could serve as an adjunctive therapy to mitigate hepatorenal toxicity in patients undergoing gentamicin treatment.",

      "abstract": "Since the recycling of composites from plant tissues is difficult, extraction of bioactive compounds from plant sources requires pre-treatment by new technology such as pulsed electric fields (PEF). Due to the reduced consumption of organic solvents, the extractive techniques such as using supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) are of interest to researchers. This work aimed to investigating the influences of different parameters of SC-CO2 (pressure, modifier volume, temperature, and dynamic time) and PEF (frequency and field strength) treatments on the amount extraction of β-carotene, lycopene, lutein, β-cryptoxanthin, total phenol content (TPC), and also antioxidant activity percentage of tomato to obtain the optimum circumstances extraction via PEF and SC-CO2 methods. PEF data showed that treatments with moderate intensity (1 Hz and 0. 25 kV/cm) enhanced the extractability of lycopene (88%), β-carotene (69%), and β-cryptoxanthin (24%). The maximum recovery in total polyphenols was achieved at a 1 Hz and 1.75 kV/cm, leading to a 41.68% growth. The SC-CO2 results showed that extraction at 55°C and 35 MPa, and in a short time of 20 min (without any modifier: methanol) resulted in the highest levels of carotenoids (100% recovery), especially lycopene, and antioxidant activity. Largest value of total polyphenols was obtained at 35 MPa, 35°C, during 30 min, and 250 μL methanol as a modifier (58.79% recovery). Results showed that the extraction of polyphenols, unlike carotenoids, required a modifier. Organic solvents, often called modifiers, are sometimes added to the supercritical fluid to increase the polarity range of the extraction process and to help overcome analyte retention in the matrix. In this study, methanol was used as a modifier in different volumes. Therefore, the SC-CO2 gentle processing conditions, compared with PEF, improved the recovery of tomato bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to optimize such treatments."

      "abstract": "Carotenoids, a family of lipid-soluble pigments, have garnered growing interest for their health-promoting benefits and are widely utilized in the food, feed, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. Rhodosporidiobolus odoratus, a representative oleaginous red yeast, is considered a promising alternative for producing high-value carotenoids including β-carotene, torulene, and torularhodin. Here, the impact of varying concentrations of NaCl treatments on carotenoid contents in R. odoratus XQR after 120 h of incubation was examined. The results indicated that, as compared to the control (59.37 μg/gdw), the synthesis of total carotenoids was significantly increased and entirely suppressed under low-to-moderate (0.25 mol/L: 68.06 μg/gdw, 0.5 mol/L: 67.62 μg/gdw, and 0.75 mol/L: 146.47 μg/gdw) and high (1.0, 1.25, and 1.5 mol/L: 0 μg/gdw) concentrations of NaCl treatments, respectively. Moreover, the maximum production of β-carotene (117.62 μg/gdw), torulene (21.81 μg/gdw), and torularhodin (7.04 μg/gdw) was achieved with a moderate concentration (0.75 mol/L) of NaCl treatment. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses suggested that the increase in β-carotene, torulene, and torularhodin production might be primarily attributed to the up-regulation of some key protein-coding genes involved in the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis (atoB, HMGCS, and mvaD), carotenoid biosynthesis (crtYB and crtI), and TCA cycle (pckA, DLAT, pyc, MDH1, gltA, acnA, IDH1/2, IDH3, sucA, sucB, sucD, LSC1, SDHA, and fumA/fumB). The present study not only demonstrates a viable method to concurrently increase the production of β-carotene, torulene, torularhodin, and total carotenoids in R. odoratus XQR, but it also establishes a molecular foundation for further enhancing their production through genetic engineering."

      "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common malignancy in men. Although the prognosis in the early stages is good, the treatment of advanced PCa remains a formidable challenge. Even after an initial response to hormone therapy or chemotherapy, recurrences are frequent and resistance to any systemic treatment is common. β-Carotene (BC), a plant-derived tetraterpene, is known for its antioxidant capacity and can modulate multiple cellular signaling pathways, potentially affecting androgen synthesis. We investigated the influence of BC (dissolved in EtOH/THF with a cell culture medium or encapsulated in liposomes (LP-BCs)) on the viability, migration potential, and connective tissue cleavage capabilities of several PCa cell lines (Du145, LNCaP, PC-3, and 22Rv1) and a healthy prostate model (RWPE cells). BC significantly reduced the proliferative capacity of all investigated cell lines at various concentrations (1.5-30 µM) and decreased cell migration. However, it significantly increased the expression of epidermal-mesenchymal transition (EMT) master proteins in all cancer cell lines and RWPE (p < 0.05) These effects were not observed with LP-BCs. This study suggests that LP-BCs, with their higher antiproliferative capabilities and pronounced inhibition of the EMT, may be a more effective form of possible PCa prevention or treatment than the free form. LPs may also modulate lipid metabolism in PCa cells."

Lactating cows (n = 497) from two herds were balanced for BCS and calving period [early calving (EC); late calving (LC)] and were assigned randomly to: Control (n = 251)-supplementation with a mineral supplement; and SUP (n = 246)-supplementation with the mineral supplement fed to control + β-carotene (150 mg/day) + vitamin A (40,000 IU/day) + vitamin D3 (5000 IU/day) + vitamin E (300 mg/day) + biotin (20 mg/day). Cows were supplemented from Days -30 to 30 (Day 0 = timed artificial insemination; TAI). Pregnancy was diagnosed 30 days after TAI and foetal crown-rump distance and thoracic diameter were measured at 30 and 77 days of gestation. Cows in the SUP treatment were more likely to have BCS ≥3.0 on Day 0 (63.0 ± 3.1 vs. 60.2 ± 3.1; p < .01) and were more likely to gain BCS from Days -30 to 30 (57.7 ± 3.3 vs. 44.1 ± 3.3%; p < .01). Fewer LC cows in the SUP treatment were detected in oestrus at the time of the first TAI (Control: LC: 75.4 ± 4.4 vs. SUP: LC: 64.0 ± 5.2 vs. Control: EC: 65.3 ± 4.0 vs. SUP: EC: 71.8 ± 3.7; p = .04). There was a tendency for the SUP treatment to increase pregnancy to the first TAI (64.2 ± 3.0 vs. 56.6 ± 3.1%; p = .08). A greater percentage of SUP cows was detected in oestrus at the time of the second TAI (70.1 ± 5.0 vs. 52.3 ± 4.8%; p = .01). The SUP treatment increased pregnancy to the second TAI among LC cows (SUP: LC: 75.9 ± 8.0% vs. Control: LC: 50.0 ± 8.3% vs. Control: EC: 52.0 ± 5.9% vs. SUP: EC: 41.4 ± 6.5%; p = .02). The SUP treatment increased foetal size (crown-rump; p = .04 and thoracic diameter; p < .01) at 30 days of gestation and, despite decreasing crow-rump length at 77 days after the first TAI among EC cows (p < .01), it increased the thoracic diameter at 77 days after the first TAI independent of calving season. Our results support that pregnancy establishment and foetal growth can be improved when grazing Nellore cows are supplemented with β-carotene and vitamins A + D3 + E + biotin.",

Previous studies in animal models have demonstrated a potential protective effect of 30 mg/kg BC supplementation on renal ischemia or reperfusion injury and subsequently improved kidney function. The extension of these findings to humans, however, remains unclear. METHODS: Our study leverages previously collected data from the Physicians' Health Study I (PHS I), a large-scale, long-term, randomized trial of middle-aged and older US male physicians testing 50 mg BC every other day for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer. We examined the impact of randomized BC supplementation on self-reported incident CKD identified by self-reports stating \"yes\" to kidney disease from annual follow-up questionnaires from randomization in 1982 through the end of the randomized BC intervention at the end of 1995, and on CKD defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at the end of 1995. Analyses compared incident CKD between BC supplementation and placebo using Cox proportional hazards regression models and logistic regression. We also examined whether smoking status (current vs. former or never smoker) or other factors modified the effect of randomized BC supplementation on CKD. RESULTS: A total of 10,966 participants were randomized to BC, and 10,952 participants were randomized to a placebo group. Baseline characteristics between randomized BC groups were similar. There was no significant benefit between BC supplementation and self-reported incident CKD after adjusting for age and randomized aspirin treatment (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.86-1.08, P-value = 0.56). Stratified by smoking status, there was no significant benefit of BC supplementation and self-reported incident CKD either among former or never smokers (HR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.84-1.07, P-value = 0.41) or current smokers (HR = 1.08, 95% CI: 0.78-1.50, P-value = 0.64). Smoking status did not modify the association between BC supplementation and incident CKD (P-interaction = 0.47). In subgroup analysis among those with available serum creatinine at the study end (5480 with BC and 5496 with placebo), there was no significant benefit between BC supplementation and CKD based on eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.85-1.08, P-value = 0.49). CONCLUSION: Long-term randomized BC supplementation did not affect the risk of incident CKD in middle-aged and older male physicians."

The co-treatment group of β-carotene and chitosan restored the retinal thickness and outer nuclear layer thickness better than the group treated with the two alone, and the thickness reached the normal level. The content of β-carotene and retinoids in the liver of chitosan and β-carotene co-treated group increased by 46.75 % and 20.69 %, respectively, compared to the β-carotene group. Chitosan and β-carotene supplement suppressed the expressions of Bax, Calpain2, Caspase3, NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β, and promoted the up-regulation of Bcl2. Chitosan and β-carotene interventions remarkably contributed to the content of SCFAs and enhanced the abundance of Ruminococcaceae, Rikenellaceae, Odoribacteraceae and Helicobacteraceae.

Kinetic adsorption analysis confirmed that medium pH (9.3) and medium temperature (40 °C) were more suitable for lake preparation, while desorption occurred, possibly due to crystalline transformation of CaCO3. The isothermal analysis and model fitting results suggested that the β-carotene and CaCO3 particles combined via a monolayer adsorption process driven by physical force. Electrostatic attraction likely participated in the process due to the net negative surface charges of β-carotene dispersion and positively charged groups on the CaCO3 particle surfaces. Ethanol, ultrasonic treatment, and drying method significantly influenced the immobilization efficiency (IE) of β-carotene in the lake and light stability of the lake, without affecting its crystal form. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves confirmed absorption of β-carotene onto CaCO3. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses indicated no obvious chemical bonds between β-carotene and CaCO3. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed the presence of β-carotene on surfaces but not in the interior of the CaCO3 particles. The adsorption of β-carotene by calcium carbonate was further confirmed to be a physical adsorption on surface."

Results of optical micrographs and droplet size measurement showed that Pickering emulsions stabilized by PPI/ACNCs complexes exhibited the most excellent stability after 30 days of storage, which indicated that ACNCs had the most obvious effect to improve emulsifying capability of PPI. HIPPEs encapsulated β-carotene (βc-HIPPEs) were stabilized by PPI/ACNCs complexes and showed excellent inverted storage stability. Moreover, βc-HIPPEs exhibited typical shear thinning behavior investigated by rheological properties analysis. During thermal treatment, ultraviolet radiation and oxidation, the retentions of β-carotene encapsulated in HIPPEs were improved significantly. This research holds promise in expanding Pickering emulsions stabilized by proteins-polysaccharide particles to delivery systems for hydrophobic bioactive compounds.",

However, the effect of organic amendments on the quality and nutritional composition of edible plants has received little attention. Locally available organic amendments (sewage sludge SS, chicken manure CM, cow manure Cow, vermicompost Vermi, and biochar Bio) were chosen to test their impact on field-grown sweet potato, Ipomoea batatas L. yield, root quality, and root nutritional composition. The results indicated that utilizing Cow manure in growing sweet potatoes significantly promoted root yield and root nutritional composition. Cow treatment produced the greatest number of roots compared to Bio, CM, SS, and the control treatments. The results also revealed that the concentrations of vitamin C (260. 3 µg g-1), β-carotene (45.4 µg g-1), soluble sugars (16.7 mg g-1), and total phenols (196.3 3 µg g-1 fresh roots) were greater in the roots of plants grown in Cow compared to the roots of the control treatment. The results indicated the low impact of biochar whereas Cow is recommended for enhancing sweet potato yield and nutritional composition.",

Oxaliplatin (OXA) resistance is one of the major reasons hindering CRC therapy. β-Carotene (BC) is a provitamin A and is known to have antioxidant and anticancer effects. However, the combined effect of OXA and BC has not been investigated. Therefore, this study investigated the anticancer effects and mechanism of the combination of OXA and BC on CRC. MATERIALS/METHODS: In the present study, the effects of the combination of OXA and BC on cell viability, cell cycle arrest, and cancer stemness were investigated using HCT116, HT29, OXA-resistant cells, and human CRC organoids. RESULTS: The combination of OXA and BC enhanced apoptosis, G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, and inhibited cancer cell survival in human CRC resistant cells and CRC organoids without toxicity in normal organoids. Cancer stem cell marker expression and self-replicating capacity were suppressed by combined treatment with OXA and BC. Moreover, this combined treatment upregulated apoptosis and the stem cell-related JAK/STAT signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a novel potential role of BC in reducing resistance to OXA, thereby enhances the anticancer effects of OXA. This enhancement is achieved through the regulation of cell cycle, apoptosis, and stemness in CRC."

After giving ethanol and/or β-carotene to C57BL/6 mice, our goal was to evaluate their biochemistry, histology, and morpho-quantitative features. There were six groups of C57BL/6 mice: 1. Group C (control), 2. Group LA (low-dose alcohol), 3. Group MA (moderate-dose alcohol), 4. Group B (β-carotene), 5. Group LA + B (low-dose alcohol combined with β-carotene), and 6. Group MA + B (moderate-dose alcohol combined with β-carotene). After the animals were euthanized on day 28, each specimen's pancreatic tissue was taken. Lipase, uric acid, and amylase were assessed using biochemical assessment. Furthermore, the examination of the pancreatic structure was conducted using Ammann's fibrosis scoring system. Finally, the morpho-quantitative characteristics of the pancreatic islets and acinar cells were determined. In the serum of the MA + B group, there were higher amounts of total amylase (825.953 ± 193.412 U/L) and lower amounts of lipase (47.139 ± 6.099 U/L) (p < 0.05). Furthermore, Ammann's fibrosis punctuation in the pancreas revealed significant variations between the groups (p < 0.001). Finally, the stereological analysis of pancreatic islets showed that the groups were different (p < 0.001). These findings suggest that antioxidant treatments might help decrease the negative effects of ethanol exposure in animal models.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Reducing cigarettes per day may lower the risk of lung cancer compared with continuing to smoke at the same intensity. Other changes in smoking behaviors, such as increasing cigarette consumption or quitting for a period and relapsing, may also affect lung cancer risk. METHODS: We examined changes in smoking status and cigarettes per day among 24 613 Finnish male smokers aged 50-69 years who participated in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study. Longitudinal data on smoking were collected during study follow-up visits 3 times a year (approximately every 4 months) between 1985 and 1993. Incident lung cancer patients through 2012 were identified by the Finnish Cancer Registry. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Compared with smoking 20 cigarettes per day continuously across the intervention period, reducing an average of 5 cigarettes per day per year while smoking was associated with a 20% lower risk of lung cancer (95% CI = 0.71 to 0.90). A substantially lower risk of lung cancer was also observed when participants smoked at 50% (RR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.57 to 0.90) and 10% (RR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.36 to 0.83) of study visits, relative to smoked at 100% of study visits. CONCLUSIONS: Smokers may lower their risk of lung cancer by reducing smoking intensity (cigarettes per day while smoking) and the time they smoke. However, quitting smoking completely is the most effective way for smokers to reduce their risk of lung cancer.",

Herein, we developed a glycosylated oat protein-based nanoparticle to improve the application of β-carotene for mitigating cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression and gut microbiota imbalance in mice. The results showed that the nanoparticles facilitated a conversion of β-carotene to retinol or retinyl palmitate into the systemic circulation, leading to an increased bioavailability of β-carotene. The encapsulated β-carotene bolstered humoral immunity by elevating immunoglobulin levels, augmenting splenic T lymphocyte subpopulations, and increasing splenic cytokine concentrations in immunosuppressed mice. This effect was accompanied by the alleviation of pathological features observed in the spleen. In addition, the encapsulated β-carotene restored the abnormal gut microbiota associated with immunosuppression, including Erysipelotrichaceae, Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium and Roseburia. This study suggested that nanoparticles loaded with β-carotene have great potential for therapeutic intervention in human immune disorders by specifically targeting the gut microbiota.",

      "abstract": "The causal association between circulating β-carotene concentrations and cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains controversial. We conducted a Mendelian randomization study to explore the effects of β-carotene on various cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and stroke. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the β-carotene levels were obtained by searching published data and used as instrumental variables. Genetic association estimates for 4 CVDs (including myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and stroke) in the primary analysis, blood pressure and serum lipids (high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides) in the secondary analysis were obtained from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs). We applied inverse variance-weighted as the primary analysis method, and 3 others were used to verify as sensitivity analysis. Genetically predicted circulating β-carotene levels (natural log-transformed, µg/L) were positively associated with myocardial infarction (odds ratio [OR] 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.18, P = .011) after Bonferroni correction. No evidence supported the causal effect of β-carotene on atrial fibrillation (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96-1.09, P = .464), heart failure (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.97-1.19, P = .187), stroke (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.93-1.15, P = .540), blood pressure (P > .372) and serum lipids (P > .239). Sensitivity analysis produced consistent results. This study provides evidence for a causal relationship between circulating β-carotene and myocardial infarction. These findings have important implications for understanding the role of β-carotene in CVD and may inform dietary recommendations and intervention strategies for preventing myocardial infarction.",

      "abstract": "β-carotene is known to have pharmacological effects such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-tumor properties. However, its main mechanism and related signaling pathways in the treatment of inflammation are still unclear. In this study, component target prediction was performed by using literature retrieval and the SwissTargetPrediction database. Disease targets were collected from various databases, including DisGeNET, OMIM, Drug Bank, and GeneCards. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed, and enrichment analysis of gene ontology and biological pathways was carried out for important targets. The analysis showed that there were 191 unique targets of β-carotene after removing repeat sites. A total of 2067 targets from the three databases were integrated, 58 duplicate targets were removed, and 2009 potential disease action targets were obtained. Biological function enrichment analysis revealed 284 biological process (BP) entries, 31 cellular component (CC) entries, 55 molecular function (MF) entries, and 84 cellular pathways. The biological processes were mostly associated with various pathways and their regulation, whereas the cell components were mainly membrane components. The main molecular functions included RNA polymerase II transcription factor activity, DNA binding specific to the ligand activation sequence, DNA binding, steroid binding sequence-specific DNA binding, enzyme binding, and steroid hormone receptors. The pathways involved in the process included the TNF signaling pathway, sphingomyelin signaling pathway, and some disease pathways. Lastly, the anti-inflammatory signaling pathway of β-carotene was systematically analyzed using network pharmacology, while the molecular mechanism of β-carotene was further explored by molecular docking. In this study, the anti-inflammatory mechanism of β-carotene was preliminarily explored and predicted by bioinformatics methods, and further experiments will be designed to verify and confirm the predicted results, in order to finally reveal the anti-inflammatory mechanism of β-carotene.",

Muscle wasting is a critical factor in cancer cachexia. β‑carotene (BC) has been shown to increase muscle mass and hypertrophy in healthy mice. However, its effects on muscle tissue dysregulation in cancer cachexia have yet to be studied. In the present study, 5‑week‑old male C57BL/6J mice were injected with 1x106 Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells to induce cancer cachexia; then the mice were administered BC (4 or 8 mg/kg) for 22 days to assess its effects on muscle atrophy in the gastrocnemius muscles. The effects of BC on inflammatory cytokines, myogenesis and muscle atrophy were evaluated using C2C12 myotubes treated with LLC‑conditioned media. BC supplementation significantly suppressed tumor growth, inflammatory cytokines, and hepatic gluconeogenesis in the LLC‑induced cancer cachexia mouse model, while also improving muscle weight and grip strength. These effects are considered to be mediated by the PI3K/Akt pathway and through regulation of muscle atrophy. Moreover, BC treatment was associated with the recovery of LLC‑conditioned media‑induced muscle differentiation deficits and muscle atrophy in C2C12 myotubes. These findings indicate BC as a potential novel therapeutic agent for cancer cachexia.",

Several techniques have been implemented to assess this efficacy at various levels, including biochemical, bioelectrical, and behavioral. Namely, oxidative stress markers, monoamine levels, electrocorticography, pain threshold test, and open field test were conducted on control, FM-induced, and FM-treated groups of animals. Our results provided compelling evidence for the efficacy of carotenoid nanodispersions in treating FM-related symptoms. Specifically, we found that the dual action of the nanodispersion, as both antioxidant and antidepressant, accounted for their beneficial effects in treating FM. With further investigation, nano-carotenoids and particularly nano-lutein could potentially become an effective alternative treatment for patients with FM who do not respond to current treatment options.",

However, its effectiveness is still unclear. This systematic review, conducted according to the PRISMA guideline and assisted by the MySLR platform, addressed this issue. A total of 16 eligible original research articles were identified. Dietary intake or β-carotene serum levels were associated with improved measures of cognitive function in 7 out of 10 epidemiological studies included. In intervention studies, β-carotene consumption alone did not promote better cognitive function in the short term, but only in a long-term intervention with a mean duration of 18 years. However, all but one intervention study suggested the beneficial effects of β-carotene supplementation at doses ranging from 6 mg to 50 mg per day in combination with a multicomplex such as vitamin E, vitamin C, zinc, or selenium for a period of 16 weeks to 20 years. Despite the current limitations, the available evidence suggests a potential association between β-carotene dietary/supplementary intake and the maintenance of cognitive function. The β-carotene most probably does not act alone but in synergy with other micronutrients."

      "abstract": "β-Carotene, because it is the precursor of vitamin A and has versatile biological roles, has been applied as a feed additive in the poultry industry for a long time. In this study, we investigated the deposition and bioconversion of β-carotene in laying hens. A total of 600 Hy-line brown laying hens at 40 wk of age were randomly divided into 5 dietary treatments, each group's dietary supplemental levels of β-carotene were 0, 15, 30, 60, 120 mg/kg feed, and the vitamin A levels were all 8,000 IU/kg. After 14-wk trial, samples were collected, then carotenoids and different forms of vitamin A were detected using the novel method developed by our laboratory. We found that dietary β-carotene treatment had no significant effects on laying hens' production performance and egg quality (P > 0.05), except the yolk color. The deposition of β-carotene in the body gradually increased (P < 0.01) with the supplemental dose, whereas the contents of lutein and zeaxanthin decreased (P < 0.05). When the β-carotene supplemental level was above 30 mg/kg in the diet, the different forms of vitamin A in in serum, liver, ovary, and yolks were increased compared to the control group (P < 0.05). However, these indicators decreased when the additional dose was 120 mg/kg. Moreover, the mRNA levels of the genes involved in β-carotene absorption, bioconversion, and negative feedback regulation in duodenal mucosa and liver were upregulated after long-term feeding (P < 0.05). Histological staining of the ovaries indicated that the deposition of β-carotene led to a lower rate of follicle atresia (P < 0.05), and this positive effects may be related to the antioxidant function of β-carotene, which caused a reduction of oxidation products in the ovary (P < 0.05). Altogether, β-carotene could accumulate in laying hens intactly and exert its biological functions in tissue. Meanwhile, a part of β-carotene could also be converted into vitamin A but this bioconversion has an upper limit and negative feedback regulation."

      "abstract": "A β-carotene rich emulsion with improved physical and chemical stability was obtained in this study, using different types of protein-polysaccharide-polyphenol ternary complexes as novel emulsifiers. The ternary complexes were prepared by covalent or non-covalent binding of soy protein isolate (SPI), β-glucan (DG) and myricetin (MC), which were evidenced to be stable. It was indicated that the emulsion stabilized by covalent complex of SPI, DG and MC, exhibited higher zeta-potential and smaller particle size than those stabilized by non-covalent complex. Furthermore, the covalent complexes prepared from different addition sequences showed different efficiencies in stabilizing the emulsion, in which SPI-DG-MC and SPI-MC-DG-stabilized emulsions possess better stability, emulsifying activity and storage resistance under adverse environmental treatment, with CI values of 62.7% and 64.3% after 25 days, respectively. According to oxidative stability and rheology analysis of the emulsions, it was found that the SPI-MC-DG complex prepared at the ratio of 4:2:1 was more stable with relatively less lipid oxidation products and a tighter stacking structure, and the final LH value was 39.98 mmol/L and the MDA value was 6.34 mmol/L. These findings implied that the ternary complex has the potential to deliver fat-soluble active ingredient by means of emulsion, but which depends on the mode and sequence of the molecular interactions.",

      "abstract": "Mucopermeating nanoformulations can enhance mucosal penetration of poorly soluble drugs at their target site. In this work, thiolated chitosan (TCS)-lithocholic acid (LA) nanomicelles loaded with β-carotene, a safe phytochemical with anticancer properties, were designed to improve the pharmaceutical and pharmacological drug profile. The TCS-LA nanomicelles were characterized by FTIR to confirm the presence of the thiol group that favors skin adhesion, and to corroborate the conjugation of hydrophobic LA with hydrophilic CS to form an amphiphilic polymer derivative. Their crystalline nature and thermal behavior were investigated by XRD and DSC analyses, respectively. According to DLS and TEM, their average size was <300 nm, and their surface charge was +27.0 mV. β-carotene entrapment and loading efficiencies were 64 % and 58 %, respectively. In vitro mucoadhesion and ex vivo mucopenetration analyses further corroborated the potential of the nanoformulation to deliver the drug in a sustained manner under conditions mimicking cancer micro-environment. Anticancer studies in mice demonstrated that the loaded nanomicelles delayed skin cancer growth, as revealed by both morphological and biochemical parameters. Based on the results obtained herein, it can be concluded that drug-loaded TCS-LA is a novel, stable, effective and safe mucoadhesive formulation of β-carotene for the potential treatment of skin cancer.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of different wheat bran arabinoxylan (WBAX) concentrations (1, 2, 3, and 4 wt%) on the structural and physicochemical properties of WBAX-soybean protein isolate (SPI) emulsion-filled gels (EFGs) prepared using laccase and heat treatment. The properties of the various gels as well as their microstructure, rheology, and in vitro digestion behaviors were investigated. Results showed that WBAX-SPI EFGs with a 3 wt% WBAX concentration had a smooth and uniform appearance, high water holding capacity (98.5 ± 0.2 %), and enhanced mechanical properties. Rheological experiments suggested that a stronger and closer gel network was formed at 3 wt% WBAX concentration. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that laccase and heat treatment not only catalyzed the intramolecular crosslinking of WBAX and SPI, respectively, but also promoted the interaction between WBAX and SPI. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that the WBAX gel network was interspersed within the SPI network. The interactions contributing to the gelation analysis revealed that chemical (disulfide bond) and physical (hydrogen bond and hydrophobic) interactions promoted the formation of denser EFGs. Furthermore, the WBAX-SPI EFGs provided a β-carotene bioaccessibility of 21.8 ± 0.6 %. Therefore, our study suggests that WBAX-SPI EFGs hold promising potential for industrial applications in the delivery of β-carotene.",

Diets included no added fat, 3% added choice white grease, or 3% added soy oil with either a supplemented vitamin A (for a total of 11,640 IU vitamin A/kg, Rovimix A 1000, DSM, Parsippany, NJ, US) or beta-carotene (for a total of 8,708 IU vitamin A/kg equivalent, Rovimix β-Carotene 10%, DSM). Pigs were given a 3-d adaptation period upon arrival. Pigs were weighed at the start of the study and at the end of each phase. A blood sample was taken from one pig per pen at the start and end of the study. Tissues were collected from eight pigs at the start of the study and six pigs per treatment at the end of the study. Data were analyzed via the GLIMMIX procedure in SAS 9.4 (SAS Inst., Cary, NC). Pen was the experimental unit, and repeated measures were used for growth performance and blood parameters. There was no fat by supplement interaction (P > 0.05) on body weight (BW), but there was a tendency (P = 0.054) for heavier BWs when soy oil was added to diets. There was no difference (P > 0.05) in average daily feed intake or average daily gain (ADG). There was an improved gain:feed (P = 0.02) when pigs were fed choice white grease over no added fat. There were time differences (P < 0.05) for plasma vitamins A (retinol), D (25 hydroxy vitamin D3), and E (alpha-tocopherol). Vitamin A and D values were higher at the end of the study, whereas vitamin E values were lower at the end of the study. The choice white grease diets had the highest (P < 0.05) plasma vitamins D and E (6.74 ng/mL and 2.87 ppm, respectively). Pigs supplemented with vitamin A had higher (P < 0.05) hepatic vitamin A than pigs supplemented with beta-carotene (19.9 vs. 15.6 ppm, respectively). There were no differences (P < 0.05) between immunoglobulins G and M or mRNA abundance of select genes (retinol binding protein 2, alcohol dehydrogenase class 1, lecithin retinol acyltransferase phosphatidylcholine-retinol O-acyltransferase, and beta-carotene oxygenase 1). In conclusion, fat inclusion level and type, with either vitamin A or beta-carotene supplementation, did not affect the overall nursery pig growth performance. The addition of fat resulted in an increase in ADG and BW. Diets with choice white grease had the highest plasma vitamins D and E, and supplemental vitamin A increased hepatic vitamin A."

DESIGN: Prospective, interventional case series. PARTICIPANTS: The study included 12 patients (23 eyes) with RDH5-related FAP. METHODS: Twelve patients (23 eyes) with RDH5-related FAP received Dunaliella supplementation (total daily dose of β-carotene was 74.0 mg, comprising 28.4 mg 9-cis-β-carotene and 45.6 mg all-trans-β-carotene at a ratio of 1:1.6) for 1 year and underwent ophthalmic examinations, including full-field ERG at baseline, 3 months, and 1 year after the initial treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome was changes in the amplitudes of responses of full-field ERG before and after treatment. A linear mixed-effects model was used to evaluate the adjusted mean difference between the amplitude of each response pretreatment and posttreatment. RESULTS: Prolonged dark adaptation (DA) responses at 3 months revealed a significant impairment in the b-wave of DA 0.01 (adjusted mean difference, -34.7, 95% CI, -66.8 to -2.73, P = .041) and a-wave of DA 3.0 (-29.0, 95% CI, -50.6 to -7.41, P = .013) and DA 10.0 (-40.4, 95% CI, -67.8 to -13.0, P = .007), which were also observed at 1 year. Additionally, prolonged DA and light adaptation (LA) responses revealed statistically significant impairment at 1 year in the b-wave of DA 3.0 (-43.8, 95% CI, -82.9 to -4.78, P = .035), DA 10.0 (-59.7, 95% CI, -101.8 to -17.61, P = .009), LA 3.0 (-7.31, 95% CI, -13.6 to -1.04, P = .029), and LA 3.0 flicker (-7.53, 95% CI, -12.7 to -2.34, P = .007). CONCLUSIONS: Our study results suggest that Dunaliella supplementation comprising low levels of 9-cis-β-carotene compared with those reported in a previous study (1:1 ratio) adversely affects ERG amplitudes in patients with RDH5-related FAP.",

Recent literature uncovered the possible potential of bioactive compounds with antioxidant mechanisms to counter the issue. Cowpea (CP) isoflavones based on our previous study, vitamin D and natural antioxidant β-carotene for its pleotropic protective effects were assessed alone and in combination. Aim: The study aims to assess the antioxidant and osteoblast differentiation abilities of cowpea isoflavones alone and in combination of vitamin D (VD) and β-carotene (BC) in the human osteosarcoma cell line Saos2. Methods: Saos2 cells were maintained in cell culture conditions and concentrations of CP extract (genistein  +  daidzein), BC and VD required to increase cell proliferation were estimated using MTT assay. Upon treating cells with the EC50 concentrations, lysates were prepared and levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin were evaluated using ELISA. Oxidative stress parameters and osteoblast differentiation markers were evaluated. Results: CP extract (genistein  +  daidzein), BC and VD concentrations which enhanced the cell proliferation rate were determined and elevated levels of ALP and osteocalcin upon treatment was observed. Anti-oxidant stress parameters studied showed an increase in cells upon treatment compared to control. Significant alterations in levels of protein involved in osteoblast differentiation are observed upon treatment. Conclusion: Cowpea isoflavones has shown a significant activity against OS by elevating antioxidant parameters and inducing osteoblast differentiation in the present study.",

GM rice, Heijinmi (HJM) and Non-GM rice, Heishuai (HS), were both formulated into diets at ratios of 73.5% and 75.5% according to the AIN93 diet for rodent animals, respectively. Relative to the non-GM group, no biologically relevant differences were observed in GM group rats concerning reproductive performance such as fertility rate, gestation rate, mean duration, hormone level, and reproductive organ pathology. The developmental parameters results were not significantly different from the non-GM group such as body weight, food consumption, developmental neurotoxicity, behavior, hematology, and serum chemistry. In terms of immunotoxicity, the IgG indicators of offspring from the GM group improved in contrast with the non-GM group. Additional gut flora analysis of F0 generation rats resulted as that the treatment elicited an increased gut microflora diversity of F0 rats. And no horizontal gene transfer of Psy and CrtI genes in rats fed a GM rice HJM diet. In conclusion, we found no adverse effects related to GM rice in the extended one-generation reproductive toxicity study, indicating that GM rice is a safe alternative for its counterpart rice regarding reproductive toxicity.",

      "abstract": "Molecular docking is widely used in the assessment of the therapeutic potential of pharmaceutical agents. The binding properties of beta-carotene (BC) to acetylcholine esterase (AChE) proteins were characterized using the molecular docking method. The mechanism of AChE inhibition was assessed by an experimental in vitro kinetic study. In addition, the role of BC action was tested by the zebrafish embryo toxicity test (ZFET). The results of the docking ability of BC to AChE showed significant ligand binding mode. The kinetic parameter, i.e., the low AICc value shown as the compound was the competitive type of inhibition of AChE. Further, BC also showed mild toxicity at a higher dose (2200 mg/L) in ZFET assessment with changes in biomarkers. The LC50 value of BC is 1811.94 mg/L. Acetylcholine esterase (AChE) plays a pivotal role in the hydrolysis of acetylcholine, which leads to the development of cognitive dysfunction. BC possesses the regulation of acetylcholine esterase (AChE) and acid phosphatase (AP) activity to prevent neurovascular dysfunction. Therefore, the characterization of BC could be used as a pharmaceutical agent for the treatment of cholinergic neurotoxicity-associated neurovascular disorders such as developmental toxicity, vascular dementia, and Alzheimer's disease due to its AChE and AP inhibitory actions.",

      "abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria are the main sites for the storage and regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis. An imbalance of Ca2+ homeostasis can cause ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby inducing apoptosis. The store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) is the main channel for extracellular calcium influx. Mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (MAM) is an important agent for Ca2+ transfer from the ER to the mitochondria. Therefore, regulation of SOCE and MAMs has potential therapeutic value for disease prevention and treatment. In this study, bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs) and mice were used as models to explore the mechanisms of β-carotene to relieve ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. BAPTA-AM, EGTA (Ca2+ inhibitor), and BTP2 (SOCE channel inhibitor) alleviated ER stress and mitochondrial oxidative damage induced by increased intracellular Ca2+ levels after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Furthermore, inhibition of ER stress by 4-PBA (ER stress inhibitor), 2-APB (IP3R inhibitor), and ruthenium red (mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) inhibitor) restored mitochondrial function by reducing mitochondrial ROS. Our data also confirm that β-carotene targeted STIM1 and IP3R channels to repair LPS-induced ER stress and mitochondrial disorders. Consistent with the in vitro study, in vito experiments in mice further showed that β-carotene attenuated LPS-induced ER stress and mitochondrial oxidative damage by inhibiting the expression of STIM1 and ORAI1, and reducing the level of Ca2+ in mouse mammary glands. Therefore, ER stress-mitochondrial oxidative damage mediated by the STIM1-ER-IP3R/GRP75/VDAC1-MCU axis plays an vital role in the development of mastitis. Our results provided novel ideas and therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of mastitis.",

      "abstract": "Beta carotene is a natural anti-oxidant agent, and it inhibits the matrix metalloprotease (MMP) activity. Diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) is produced by cellular oxidative stress. The role of the beta carotene effect in diabetic neuropathic pain is not explored yet. The present study is designed for the evaluation of the palm oil mill effluent-derived beta carotene (PBC) effect in DNP in zebrafish. The DNP was induced by the intraperitoneal administration of streptozotocin (STZ). Blood glucose levels of above 15 mM were considered to be diabetic conditions. The zebrafish were exposed to test compound PBC (25, 50, and 100 µM), pregabalin (PG: 10 μM), and an MMP-13 inhibitor (CL-82198; 10 μM) for 10 consecutive days from day 11. The neuralgic behavioral parameters, i.e., temperature test, acetic acid test, and fin clip test were assessed on day 0 and the 7th, 14th, and 21st days. On the 22nd day, the blood glucose and MMP-13 levels and brain thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), reduced glutathione (GSH), and MMP-13 activity levels were estimated. The treatment of PBC ameliorated the DNP-associated behavioral and biochemical changes. The results are similar to those of PG and CL-82198 treatments. Hence, the PBC possesses a potentially ameliorative effect against DNP due to its potential anti-oxidant, anti-lipid peroxidation, and MMP-13 inhibitory actions."

      "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) primarily progresses into retinal degeneration caused by microvascular dysfunction. The pathophysiology of DR progression is still uncertain. This study investigates the function of beta-carotene (PBC) originating from palm oil mill effluent in the treatment of diabetes in mice. An intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (35 mg/kg) was used to induce diabetes, which was then accelerated by an intravitreal (i.vit.) injection of STZ (20 µL on day 7). PBC (50 and 100 mg/kg) and dexamethasone (DEX: 10 mg/kg) were also administered orally (p.o.) for 21 days. At various time intervals, the optomotor response (OMR) and visual-cue function test (VCFT) responses were evaluated. Biomarkers, such as reduced glutathione (GSH), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARSs), and catalase activity were determined in retinal tissue samples. DR significantly lowers the spatial frequency threshold (SFT) and time spent in the target quadrant (TSTQ), increases the reaching time in the visual-cue platform (RVCP), lowers retinal GSH and catalase activity levels, and elevates TBARS levels. The treatments of PBC and DEX also ameliorate STZ-induced DR alterations. The potential ameliorative activity of PBC in DR is attributed to its anti-diabetic, anti-oxidative, and control of blood-retinal barrier layer properties."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Naringenin, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) activator found in citrus fruits, upregulates markers of thermogenesis and insulin sensitivity in human adipose tissue. Our pharmacokinetics clinical trial demonstrated that naringenin is safe and bioavailable, and our case report showed that naringenin causes weight loss and improves insulin sensitivity. PPARs form heterodimers with retinoic-X-receptors (RXRs) at promoter elements of target genes. Retinoic acid is an RXR ligand metabolized from dietary carotenoids. The carotenoid β-carotene reduces adiposity and insulin resistance in clinical trials. Our goal was to examine if carotenoids strengthen the beneficial effects of naringenin on human adipocyte metabolism. METHODS: Human preadipocytes from donors with obesity were differentiated in culture and treated with 8µM naringenin + 2µM β-carotene (NRBC) for seven days. Candidate genes involved in thermogenesis and glucose metabolism were measured as well as hormone-stimulated lipolysis. RESULTS: We found that β-carotene acts synergistically with naringenin to boost UCP1 and glucose metabolism genes including GLUT4 and adiponectin, compared to naringenin alone. Protein levels of PPARα, PPARγ and PPARγ-coactivator-1α, key modulators of thermogenesis and insulin sensitivity, were also upregulated after treatment with NRBC. Transcriptome sequencing was conducted and the bioinformatics analyses of the data revealed that NRBC induced enzymes for several non-UCP1 pathways for energy expenditure including triglyceride cycling, creatine kinases, and Peptidase M20 Domain Containing 1 (PM20D1). A comprehensive analysis of changes in receptor expression showed that NRBC upregulated eight receptors that have been linked to lipolysis or thermogenesis including the β1-adrenergic receptor and the parathyroid hormone receptor. NRBC increased levels of triglyceride lipases and agonist-stimulated lipolysis in adipocytes. We observed that expression of RXRγ, an isoform of unknown function, was induced ten-fold after treatment with NRBC. We show that RXRγ is a coactivator bound to the immunoprecipitated PPARγ protein complex from white and beige human adipocytes. DISCUSSION: There is a need for obesity treatments that can be administered long-term without side effects. NRBC increases the abundance and lipolytic response of multiple receptors for hormones released after exercise and cold exposure. Lipolysis provides the fuel for thermogenesis, and these observations suggest that NRBC has therapeutic potential.",

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Despite recent therapeutic advancements, resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) remains a major obstacle to the successful treatment of this disease. We have previously identified the ribosomal protein uL3 as a key player in the cell response to 5-FU, and loss of uL3 is associated with 5-FU chemoresistance. Natural products, like carotenoids, have shown the ability to enhance cancer cell response to drugs and may provide a safer choice to defeat chemoresistance in cancer. Transcriptome analysis of a cohort of 594 colorectal patients revealed a correlation between uL3 expression and both progression-free survival and response to treatment. RNA-Seq data from uL3-silenced CRC cells demonstrated that a low uL3 transcriptional state was associated with an increased expression of specific ATP-binding cassette (ABC) genes. Using two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) models of 5-FU-resistant CRC cells stably silenced for uL3, we investigated the effect of a novel therapeutic strategy by combining β-carotene and 5-FU using nanoparticles (NPs) as a drug delivery system. Our results indicated that the combined treatment might overcome 5-FU chemoresistance, inducing cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase and apoptosis. Furthermore, the combined treatment significantly reduced the expression levels of analyzed ABC genes. In conclusion, our findings suggest that β-carotene combined with 5-FU may be a more effective therapeutic approach for treating CRC cells with low levels of uL3.",

      "abstract": "The activation of brown fat and induction of beige adipocytes, so-called non-shivering thermogenesis, is emerging as a promising target for therapeutic intervention in obesity management. Our previous report demonstrated that β-carotene (BC) induces beige adipocytes to increase UCP1-dependent thermogenic activity. However, the UCP1-independent thermogenic effect of BC on adipose tissues remains unexplored. In this study, we examined the effects of BC on UCP1-independent thermogenic activity with a focus on the ATP-consuming futile cycles in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. BC increased intracellular calcium levels and stimulated the expression of calcium cycling-related proteins, including sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) 2b, ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2), voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2 (CaMK2) in 3T3-L1 white adipocytes. In addition, BC stimulated thermogenesis by activating the creatine metabolism-related thermogenic pathway. Moreover, BC activated β-carotene oxygenase 1 (BCO1), which efficiently cleaved BC to retinal and consequently converted to its transcriptionally active form retinoic acid. These BC conversion products also exhibited thermogenic effects comparable to a similar level of BC. The mechanistic study revealed that retinal exhibited thermogenic activity independently of retinoic acid and retinoic acid-mediated thermogenesis was resulted partly from conversion of retinal. Moreover, BC activated α1-AR and UCP1-independent thermogenic effectors independently of UCP1 expression. In conclusion, the thermogenic response to BC and its conversion products in 3T3-L1 white adipocytes involves two interacting pathways, one mediated via β3-adrenergic receptors (β3-AR) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and the other via α1-AR and increases in cytosolic Ca2+ levels activated by calcium regulatory proteins.",

These bioactives may mitigate chronic diseases. Consumption of multiple phytochemicals may impact bioactivity in synergistic or antagonistic manners. OBJECTIVES: Two studies in weanling male Mongolian gerbils assessed the relative bioefficacy of β-carotene equivalents (BCEs) to vitamin A (VA) with simultaneous consumption of the non-PAC lycopene or anthocyanins from multicolored carrots. METHODS: After 3-wk VA depletion, 5-6 gerbils were killed as baseline groups. The remaining gerbils were divided into 4 carrot treatment groups; the positive control group received retinyl acetate and the negative control group was given vehicle soybean oil (n = 10/group; n = 60/study). In the lycopene study, gerbils consumed feed varying in lycopene sourced from red carrots. In the anthocyanin study, gerbils consumed feed varying in anthocyanin content sourced from purple-red carrots, and positive controls received lycopene. Treatment feeds had equalized BCEs: 5.59 ± 0.96 μg/g (lycopene study) and 7.02 ± 0.39 μg/g (anthocyanin study). Controls consumed feeds without pigments. Serum, liver, and lung samples were analyzed for retinol and carotenoid concentrations using HPLC. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey's studentized range test. RESULTS: In the lycopene study, liver VA did not differ between groups (0.11 ± 0.07 μmol/g) indicating no effect of varying lycopene content. In the anthocyanin study, liver VA concentrations in the medium-to-high (0.22 ± 0.14 μmol/g) and medium-to-low anthocyanin (0.25 ± 0.07 μmol/g) groups were higher than the negative control (0.11 ± 0.07 μmol/g) (P < 0.05). All treatment groups maintained baseline VA concentrations (0.23 ± 0.06 μmol/g). Combining studies, serum retinol had 12% sensitivity to predict VA deficiency, defined as 0.7 μmol/L. CONCLUSIONS: These gerbil studies suggested that simultaneous consumption of carotenoids and anthocyanins does not impact relative BCE bioefficacy. Breeding carrots for enhanced pigments to improve dietary intake should continue.",

On approximately day 60 of gestation and through the lactation period, 194 sows (blocked by parity) were assigned to a common gestation diet or the common diet supplemented with 80 ppm oxidized beta-carotene (OxC-Beta, Aviagen, Ottawa, ON, Canada). A subset of sows (N = 54 per treatment) were sampled for blood and body weight recorded at the beginning of the study, farrowing, and weaning. A blood sample was taken from a subset of piglets at birth and weaning, and all piglet weights were recorded. Blood was analyzed for vitamin A as retinol concentrations and immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgG) levels were assessed from the sow's blood. Twelve pigs (N = 6 per treatment) were euthanized at birth and weaning. The livers were collected and analyzed for the Kupffer cell phagocytic activity through flow cytometry. Whole blood was analyzed via flow cytometry for cluster of differentiation (CD335, CD8, and CD4). Colostrum during farrowing and milk at weaning were analyzed for IgG and IgA concentrations. Data were analyzed via SAS 9.4 using MIXED and frequency procedures where appropriate. No differences (P > 0.05) between dietary treatments were observed in sow reproductive performance, feed intake, wean to estrus interval, or piglet growth performance. No differences (P > 0.05) were observed in the plasma or liver for vitamin A. No differences (P > 0.05) were observed in the composition of the colostrum or milk. No immunological differences (P > 0.05) were observed in the piglets' liver and blood or sow antibodies in colostrum and milk. The supplementation of OxC-Beta did (P < 0.05) decrease IgM and tended (P < 0.10) to decrease IgG in sow plasma. No differences (P > 0.05) were observed in the reproductive performance of subsequent litter information from the sows. Gilt litter weaning weight and feed intake were reduced (P < 0.05) compared to sow performance. In conclusion, the supplementation of OxC-Beta at 80 ppm from day 60 of gestation through lactation does not affect the reproductive performance of sows, litter growth performance, vitamin A status, piglet immune status, and antibodies or composition in colostrum and milk.",

      "abstract": "Equine semen cryopreservation is one of the major procedures for the genetic conservation of rare and endangered genotypes. The current study was conducted to evaluate the effect of egg yolk plasma (EYP) enriched with β-carotene as an antioxidant supplement on INRA-96 extender regarding freezing Arabic stallion sperm. For this purpose, β-carotene various concentrations were utilized as a supplementary ingredient in formulating the diets of laying hens. Birds were randomly divided into four groups, fed with 0 (control), 500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg in a supplemented diet with β-carotene. Subsequently, various variants of enriched extender (INRA-96 + 2.5% glycerol [G]) were gained by adding 2% EYP from four treatment groups. The sperm characteristics, including motility, viability, morphology, plasma membrane integrity (HOS test), lipid peroxidation (MDA) and DNA fragmentation, were evaluated after thawing. According to the results obtained in this study, the addition of EYP from T2 and T4 (500 and 2000 mg/kg of β-carotene in hens' diet) to the extender (INRA-96 + 2.5% G) leads to an increase in total motility (50.50% and 49.49%, respectively), progressive motility (32.6% and 31.8%, respectively), viability (68.7% and 66.1%, respectively) and plasma membrane integrity (57.7% and 50.6%, respectively). Moreover, lipid peroxidation (1.3 and 1.4 nmol/mL, respectively) and DNA fragmentation (8.6% and 9.9%, respectively) were diminished using the mentioned treatments. However, sperm morphology was not affected by the treatments. In the current study, we concluded that the optimal concentration of β-carotene in the laying hen's diet (500 mg/kg) could reveal the best results about sperm quality. So, EYP enriched with β-carotene acts as a valuable natural and safe supplementary material that could be exploited for enhancing stallion sperm quality in cryopreservation conditions.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction play critical roles in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in the brain. β-carotene (βCAR) is a naturally occurring pigment present in fruits and vegetables that expresses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. This study was conducted to investigate the involvement of Bcl2/Bax and NF-κB signaling pathways in the potential protective role of βCAR against brain injury in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model. A focal brain ischemia model was created for 2 h, followed by reperfusion. Rats were given 10 and 20 mg/kg of βCAR for 7 days orally before induction of ischemia, at the start of reperfusion, and 3 days after ischemia. Scores of neurological deficit were rated 24 h after induction of ischemia. Motor coordination and spontaneous coordinate activities were assessed using rotarod and activity cage, respectively. After 2 h of the last dose, the animals were killed and their brains were extracted for further examinations. The results of the study show that βCAR diminished the score of neurological deficits and ameliorated motor coordination, balance, and locomotor activity in the I/R control group. Further, βCAR resulted in diminution of malondialdehyde (MDA) and augmentation of reduced glutathione (GSH) contents, as well as the elevation of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase (CAT) enzyme activities in the brain homogenates of I/R rats. βCAR treatment significantly reduced nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) brain content and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and ameliorated the histological alterations in the brain tissues. βCAR significantly suppressed Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and caspase-3 expression, as well as upregulated B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) expression, suggesting a neuroprotective potential via downregulating NF-kB and protecting the rat brain against the I/R-associated apoptotic injury."

Five hundred 28-day-old-weaned barrows and gilts were used in a 140-day complete wean-to-finish feeding trial. Animals were randomized by weight, and each pen contained 20 pigs with the same ratio of barrows to gilts. There were five dietary treatment groups with five replicate pens per treatment: Control basal diet, no antibiotics or OxBC; Basal diet with antibiotics; no OxBC; Basal diet supplemented with 2, 4, or 8 mg OxBC/kg of diet, no antibiotics. Growth performance parameters were calculated for each production stage (Starter: Days 1−28, Grower: Days 29−84, Finisher: Days 85−140) and for the overall study (Days 1−140). OxBC and antibiotics each improved growth rate, feed efficiency, and body weight compared to the unsupplemented control (p < 0.001). Animals receiving 4 and 8 mg/kg OxBC performed better than animals on antibiotics (p < 0.001). In Starter pigs, OxBC reduced the occurrence of diarrhea dose-dependently (2, 4, and 8 mg/kg) and more so than did antibiotics (p < 0.001). These findings support the concept that oxidized β-carotene can facilitate swine growth and health in the absence of in-feed antibiotics."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The β-carotene oxygenase 1 (BCO1) is the enzyme responsible for the cleavage of β-carotene to retinal, the first intermediate in vitamin A formation. Preclinical studies suggest that BCO1 expression is required for dietary β-carotene to affect lipid metabolism. The goal of this study was to generate a gene therapy strategy that over-expresses BCO1 in the adipose tissue and utilizes the β-carotene stored in adipocytes to produce vitamin A and reduce obesity. METHODS: We generated a novel adipose-tissue-specific, adeno-associated vector to over-express BCO1 (AT-AAV-BCO1) in murine adipocytes. We tested this vector using a unique model to achieve β-carotene accumulation in the adipose tissue, in which Bco1-/- mice were fed β-carotene. An AT-AAV over-expressing green fluorescent protein was utilized as control. We evaluated the adequate delivery route and optimized cellular and organ specificity, dosage, and exposure of our vectors. We also employed morphometric analyses to evaluate the effect of BCO1 expression in adiposity, as well as HPLC and mass spectrometry to quantify β-carotene and retinoids in tissues, including retinoic acid. RESULTS: AT-AAV-BCO1 infusions in the adipose tissue of the mice resulted in the production of retinoic acid, a vitamin A metabolite with strong effects on gene regulation. AT-AAV-BCO1 treatment also reduced adipose tissue size and adipocyte area by 35% and 30%, respectively. These effects were sex-specific, highlighting the complexity of vitamin A metabolism in mammals. CONCLUSIONS: The over-expression of BCO1 through delivery of an AT-AAV-BCO1 leads to the conversion of β-carotene to vitamin A in adipocytes, which subsequently results in reduction of adiposity. These studies highlight for the first time the potential of adipose tissue β-carotene as a target for BCO1 over-expression in the reduction of obesity.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Primary tumor treatment through surgical resection and adjuvant therapy has been extensively studied, but there is a lack of effective strategies and drugs for the treatment of tumor metastases. Here, we describe a functional product based on a combination of compounds, which can be used as an adjuvant therapy and has well-known mechanisms for inhibiting cancer metastases, improving anti-cancer treatment, and enhancing immunity and antioxidant capacity. Our designed combination, named MVBL, consists of four inexpensive compounds: L-selenium-methylselenocysteine (MSC), D-‍α‍-tocopheryl succinic acid (VES), β‍-carotene (β‍-Ca), and L-lysine (Lys). METHODS: The effects of MVBL on cell viability, cell cycle, cell apoptosis, cell migration, cell invasion, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and paclitaxel (PTX)-combined treatment were studied in vitro. The inhibition of tumor metastasis, antioxidation, and immune enhancement capacity of MVBL were determined in vivo. RESULTS: MVBL exhibited higher toxicity to tumor cells than to normal cells. It did not significantly affect the cell cycle of cancer cells, but increased their apoptosis. Wound healing, adhesion, and transwell assays showed that MVBL significantly inhibited tumor cell migration, adhesion, and invasion. MVBL sensitized MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells to PTX, indicating that it can be used as an adjuvant to enhance the therapeutic effect of chemotherapy drugs. In mice, experimental data showed that MVBL inhibited tumor metastasis, prolonged their survival time, and enhanced their antioxidant capacity and immune function. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the roles of MVBL in improving immunity and antioxidation, preventing tumor growth, and inhibiting metastasis in vitro and in vivo. MVBL may be used as an adjuvant drug in cancer therapy for improving the survival and quality of life of cancer patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Research on aging is growing as the elderly make up a greater share of the population, focusing on reversing and inhibiting the aging process. The exhaustion and senescence of stem cells are the fundamental drivers behind aging. β-Carotene has been depicted to have many biological functions, and we speculate that it may have an anti-aging effect. METHODS: Firstly, the anti-aging property of β-carotene was investigated in vitro using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) induced by H2O2. The anti-aging effect was characterized using Western-bloting, confocal laser scanning microscopy, indirect immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry. The anti-aging property was also tested in vivo using aged mice. RESULTS: The in vitro experiment revealed that β-carotene could relieve the aging of MSCs, as evidenced by a series of aging marker molecules such as p16 and p21. β-Carotene appeared to inhibit aging by regulating the KAT7-P15 signaling axis. The in vivo experiment revealed that β-carotene treatment has significantly down-regulated the aging level of tissues and organs. CONCLUSIONS: In this work, we explored the anti-aging effect of β-carotene in vivo and in vitro. The experimental results indicate that β-carotene may be an important potential anti-aging molecule, which can be used as a drug or in functional food to treat aging in the future.",

      "abstract": "Rod and cone photoreceptors in the retina mediate dim light and daylight vision, respectively. Despite their distinctive functions, rod and cone visual pigments utilize the same vitamin A-derived chromophore. To sustain vision, vitamin A precursors must be acquired in the gut, metabolized, and distributed to the eyes. Deficiencies in this pathway in inherited ocular disease states deplete cone photoreceptors from chromophore and eventually lead to cell death, whereas the more abundant rod photoreceptors are less affected. However, pathways that support cone function and survival under such conditions are largely unknown. Using biochemical, histological, and physiological approaches, we herein show that intervention with β-carotene in STRA6-deficient mice improved chromophore supply to cone photoreceptors. Relieving the inherent negative feedback regulation of β-carotene oxygenase-1 activity in the intestine by genetic means further bolstered cone photoreceptor functioning in the STRA6-deficient eyes. A vitamin A-rich diet, however, did not improve cone photoreceptor function in STRA6-deficiency. We provide evidence that the beneficial effect of β-carotene on cones results from favorable serum kinetics of retinyl esters in lipoproteins. The respective alterations in lipoprotein metabolism maintained a steady supply of retinoids to the STRA6-deficient eyes, which ameliorated the competition for chromophore between rod and cone photoreceptors. Together, our study elucidates a cone photoreceptor-survival pathway and unravels an unexpected metabolic connection between the gut and the retina.",

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis verified the covalent linking between WPI and EGCG. The highest grafting efficiency was obtained for enzyme conjugate, followed for alkaline conjugate. Conjugation of EGCG decreased the α-helix content and fluorescence intensity of protein, and these changes depend on both EGCG conjugation and the cross-linking methods.

Nanoemulsions stabilized by ultrasound-treated complex/conjugate showed the highest encapsulation efficiency; during gastric digestion, these nanoemulsions also demonstrated the smallest droplet sizes and the highest absolute values of zeta potential, indicating that both electrostatic complexation/covalent conjugation and ultrasound treatment could significantly improve the stability of the resulting nanoemulsions. In comparison, complexes were more beneficial for the controlled release of β-carotene; however, the conjugate-stabilized nanoemulsion showed an overall higher bioaccessibility. The results were also confirmed by optical micrographs. Furthermore, nanoemulsions stabilized by ultrasound-prepared complexes/conjugates exhibited the highest stability during 14-day storage at 25 °C. The results suggested that ultrasound-prepared SPI-CP complexes and conjugates had great application potential for the delivery of hydrophobic nutrients."

In the present study, we investigated whether the administration of β-carotene under hyperglycemic conditions altered the expression level of inflammation-related genes and whether any observed differences were associated with changes in histone modifications in juvenile macrophage-like THP-1 cells. THP-1 cells (from a human monocytic leukemia cell line) were cultured in low glucose (5 mM), high glucose (25 mM), or high glucose (25 mM) + β-carotene (5 μM) media for 1 day, and mRNA expression levels of genes related to oxidative stress and inflammation, and histone modifications were determined by mRNA microarray and qRT-PCR analyses, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, respectively. The expression of inflammation-related genes, such as IL31RA, CD38, and NCF1B, and inflammation-associated signaling pathway genes, such as ITGAL, PRAM1, and CSF3R, were upregulated by β-carotene under high-glucose conditions. Under these conditions, histone H3 lysine 4 (K4) demethylation, H3K36 trimethylation, and H3K9 acetylation around the CD38, NCF1B, and ITGAL genes were higher in β-carotene-treated cells than in untreated cells. Treatment of juvenile macrophage-like THP-1 cells with β-carotene under these high glucose conditions induced the expression of inflammation-related genes, K9 acetylation, and K4 di- and K36 trimethylation of histone H3 around these genes."

Placental tissue and venous blood of 26 GDM patients and 18 normal women were collected. Mice fed a high-fat diet were established as GDM models and treated with β-carotene, from which peripheral blood and placenta tissue were collected. HTR-8/SVneo cells were treated with 10-7  mol/L insulin for 48 h and established as insulin resistance cell models. The expression of SHBG, GLUT1, GLUT3, GLUT4, IRS-1, IRS-2, PI3Kp85α, and p-CREB/CREB in placental tissues and HTR-8/SVneo cells was detected. Insulin resistance index was calculated from the values of fasting blood glucose and fasting insulin. The glucose consumption of insulin-resistant cells was calculated by detecting the glucose content of the supernatant. The cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) kit was applied to measure the concentration of cAMP in cells. SHBG was lowly expressed in GDM. β-Carotene treatment upregulated SHBG in the placenta of GDM mice and in insulin-resistant HTR-8/SVneo cells. Overexpression of SHBG upregulated GLUT3, GLUT4, and IRS-1 and enhanced glucose consumption in insulin-resistant cells. β-Carotene treatment promoted the expression of SHBG, GLUT4 and IRS-1 and increased glucose consumption in insulin-resistant cells underexpressing SHBG. Silencing of SHBG decreased the levels of cAMP and pCREB/CREB but β-carotene treatment increased their expression despite SHBG silencing in insulin-resistant cells. β-Carotene promotes glucose transport and inhibits insulin resistance in GDM by increasing the expression of SHBG.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aging is a phenomenon universally involving all organisms, genetically determined, and epigenetically influenced by the environment. Numerous observational studies have shown the positive impact of non-pharmacological approaches started in younger age on chronic conditions affecting the elderly health and survival. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effect of beta-carotene on the total and cause-specific mortality as reported by randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: We searched Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and CENTRAL Cochrane from inception to September 2021. Studies were eligible if enrolled adults with any health condition, compared beta-carotene supplements at any dose with placebo or no intervention, provided information on deaths from any cause, and were RCTs, in English. The risk of bias was assessed by the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the GRADE. Risk ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were used and a P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Among 3,942 articles searched, 44 articles on 31 RCTs, which included 216,734 total subjects, 108,622 in beta-carotene supplement groups, and 108,112 in the placebo or no-intervention groups, were involved in the final analyses. In a random-effects meta-analysis of all 31 trials, beta-carotene supplements were found to have no preventive effect on mortality (risk ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.98-1.05, I 2 = 42%). Further, the analysis showed no preventive effect on cancer, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and other mortality causes. Instead, beta-carotene supplementation significantly increased the risk of lung cancer mortality (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02, 1.27, I 2 = 3%) but decreased the risk of human immunodeficiency virus-related mortality (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.33, 0.92, I 2 = 0). CONCLUSION: More studies should be performed to better define the role of beta-carotene on survival, to confirm or deny our results. Therefore, the possible beneficial or harmful effects of the beta-carotene supplementation on mortality must not be overstated.

The order of grafting ratio of PA in CS-PA conjugates was CS400 (400 kDa CS) > CS200 (200 kDa CS) > CS100 (100 kDa CS). UV-vis, FT-IR and 1H NMR spectra proved that PA was covalently bonded to CS through amino and ester linkages. Compared with native CS, three CS-PA conjugates exhibited reduced crystallinity and thermal stability and improved antioxidant activity, with a molecular weight-dependent relationship. Besides, CS-PA-conjugate particles formed by ionic gelling procedure were spherically shaped and homogeneously dispersed, which substantially improved the stability of β-carotene in Pickering emulsions than CS particles under ultraviolet irradiation, natural light exposure and heat treatment, and the retention rates of β-carotene were in the following order: CS200-PA- > CS400-PA- > CS100-PA-conjugate particles. Furthermore, the oxidation stability of Pickering emulsions fabricated by CS-PA-conjugate particles was also higher than that of CS particles. These results will provide valuable information for the application of CS-PA conjugates to protect bioactive components and inhibit lipid oxidation in emulsion systems.",

The diabetic vascular dementia (VaD) was induced by administration of nicotinamide (NA; 50 mg/kg; i.p.) and streptozotocin (STZ; 50 mg/kg; i.p.). The test compound, BC (50 and 100 mg/kg; p.o.), and the reference compound, donepezil (DP) (1 mg/kg; p.o.), were administered for 15 consecutive days. Changes in learning and memory were assessed by escape latency time (ELT) and times spent in target quadrant (TSTQ) in the Morris water maze (MWM) test. The changes in neurotransmitter, i.e., acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and oxidative stress markers, i.e., thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) and reduced glutathione (GSH), were estimated in hippocampal tissue of the rat brain. The administration of STZ caused significant deterioration of cognitive function (decreased ELT and raised the TSTQ) as compared to the normal group. Treatment with BC and DP diminished the increased AChE activity, TBARS level and decreased GSH level caused by STZ. Thus, BC ameliorates the diabetic vascular complications in VaD due to its potential anticholinergic, antioxidative and free radical scavenging actions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating disease affecting the gastrointestinal tract in the newborn period. In recent years, the role of apoptosis and autophagy in intestinal mucosal barrier dysfunction has come into prominence in research regarding the pathogenesis of NEC. β-Carotene is a well-known vitamin A precursor, and its content in breast milk is relatively high, especially in the colostrum. In the present study, we investigated the protective effect of β-carotene on necrotizing enterocolitis model cells IEC-6 induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). METHODS: CCK-8 assay was performed to evaluate cell viability. The Annexin V-FITC/PI method was used to detect apoptosis. Western blotting was utilized to measure the expression levels of proteins. Immunofluorescence analysis was used to assess the autophagy of IEC-6 cells. RESULTS: Our findings indicated that β-carotene inhibited the apoptosis of IEC-6 cells by downregulating cleaved caspase-3 levels and Bax levels and upregulating Bcl-2 levels, reducing cell autophagy via downregulating LC3II/I ratio and upregulating p62 levels. In addition, the expression of p-PI3K, p-AKT, and p-mTOR was upregulated after β-carotene treatment. Interestingly, these changes induced by β-carotene were partially reversed by rapamycin and voxtalisib. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our findings indicated that β-carotene can attenuate apoptosis and autophagy of IEC-6 cells induced by LPS via activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Therefore, β-carotene may be a promising drug used in the clinical treatment of NEC."

Rhodosporidiobolus colostri is a cold-adapted yeast that has piqued interest as a natural source of microbial carotenoids, including β-carotene, torulene and torularhodin. Here, the effect of low temperature on carotenoid production in R. colostri was investigated. The results indicated that the total carotenoid production was significantly increased at the low temperature (16 ℃) treatment (29.016 mg/L) as compared to control (25 ℃) (17.147 mg/L) after 5 days of cultivation. Among them, the increase in β-carotene and torulene serve as the main contributors to the improvement in total carotenoid production. Integrative analyses of the transcriptome and metabolome suggested that the up-regulation of the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway and the down-regulation of the TCA cycle flux allow more acetyl-CoA to be diverted to carotenogenesis, which might be the reason for the increased production of β-carotene and torulene in R. colostri under low temperature treatment. Our results presented herein should not only provide an effective strategy for increasing total carotenoids production in R. colostri, but lay the molecular groundwork to further facilitate genetic engineering to enhance the yield of certain carotenoids.",

Our aim was to determine if oral β-carotene intake had an antioxidant effect on CYP2E1 gene expression in mice that had previously consumed ethanol. C57BL/6 mice were used and distributed into: control (C), low-dose alcohol (LA), moderate-dose alcohol (MA), β-carotene (B), low-dose alcohol+β-carotene (LA + B), and moderate-dose alcohol+β-carotene (MA + B). Animals were euthanized at the end of the experiment, and liver tissue was taken from each one. CYP2E1 was measured using qPCR to detect liver damage. The relative expression level of each RNA was estimated using the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) technique (2-ΔΔCT method) by averaging the Ct values from three replicates. The LA+B (2267 ± 0.707) and MA+B (2.307 ± 0.384) groups had the highest CYP2E1 fold change values. On the other hand, the C (1.053 ± 0.292) and LA (1.240 ± 0.163) groups had the lowest levels. These results suggest that ethanol feeding produced a fold increase in CYP2E1 protein in mice as compared to the control group. Increased CYP2E1 activity was found to support the hypothesis that β-carotene might be dangerous during ethanol exposure in animal models. Our findings imply that β-carotene can increase the hepatic damage caused by low and high doses of alcohol. Therefore, the quantity of alcohol ingested, the exposure period, the regulatory mechanisms of alcoholic liver damage, and the signaling pathways involved in the consumption of both alcohol and antioxidant must all be considered."

      "abstract": "Beta-carotene (BC) is a well-known antioxidant. However, increasing evidence shows that under severe oxidative conditions, BC can become pro-oxidant, an effect that may be enhanced in the presence of iron (II). In our earlier studies, we observed that despite increasing heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) levels in the heart, the protective effects of BC have been lost when it was used at a high concentration. Since iron releases from heme as a consequence of HO-1 activity, we hypothesized that the application of an iron-chelator (IC) would reverse the lost cardiac protection associated with an elevated HO-1 level. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the effects of desferrioxiamine (DFO) in isolated, ischemic/reperfused rat hearts after long-term treatment with vehicle or high-dose (HD) BC. Vehicle or 150 mg/bw kg daily doses of BC were administered to the rats for 4 weeks, and then their hearts were removed and subjected to 30 min of global ischemia (ISA) followed by 120 min of reperfusion (REP). During the experiments, cardiac function was registered, and at the end of the REP period, infarct size (IS) and HO-1 expression were measured. The results show that DFO treatment alone during REP significantly ameliorated postischemic cardiac function and decreased IS, although HO-1 expression was not increased significantly. In hearts isolated from BC-treated rats, no cardioprotective effects, despite an elevated HO-1 level, were observed, while DFO administration after ISA resulted in a mild improvement in heart function and IS. Our results suggest that iron could have a role whether BC exerts antioxidant or pro-oxidant effects in ISA/REP-injured hearts.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: β-cryptoxanthin (BCX), one of the major carotenoids detected in human circulation, can protect against the development of fatty liver disease. BCX can be metabolized through β-carotene-15,15'-oxygenase (BCO1) and β-carotene-9',10'-oxygenase (BCO2) cleavage pathways to produce both vitamin A and apo-carotenoids, respectively, which are considered important signaling molecules in a variety of biological processes. Recently, we have demonstrated that BCX treatment reduced hepatic steatosis severity and hepatic total cholesterol levels in both wide type and BCO1-/-/BCO2-/- double knock out (KO) mice. Whether the protective effect of BCX is seen in single BCO2-/- KO mice is unclear. METHODS: In the present study, male BCO2-/- KO mice at 1 and 5 months of age were assigned to two groups by age and weight-matching as follows: (I) -BCX control diet alone (AIN-93 purified diets); (II) +BCX 10 mg (supplemented with 10 mg of BCX/kg of diet) for 3 months. At 4 and 8 months of age, hepatic steatosis and inflammatory foci were evaluated by histopathology. Retinoids and BCX concentrations in liver tissue were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Hepatic protein expressions of SIRT1, acetylated and total FoxO1, PGC1α, and PPARα were determined by the Western blot analysis. Real-time PCR for gene expressions (MCAD, SCD1, FAS, TNFα, and IL-1β gene expression relative to β-actin) was conducted in the liver. RESULTS: Steatosis was detected at 8 months but not at 4 months of age. Moreover, BCX supplementation significantly reduced the severity of steatosis in the livers of BCO2 KO mice, which was associated with changes in hepatic SIRT1 acetylation of FOXO1, PGC1α protein expression and PPARα protein expression in BCO2-/- KO mice. HPLC analysis showed that hepatic BCX was detected in BCX supplemented groups, but there were no differences in the hepatic levels of retinol and retinyl palmitate (RP) among all groups. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provided experimental evidence that BCX intervention can reduce liver steatosis independent of BCO2."

      "abstract": "Carotenoids are indispensable to plants and essential for human nutrition and health. Carotenoid contents are strongly influenced by light through light-responsive genes such as B-Box (BBX) genes. BBX proteins, a class of zinc-finger transcription factors, mediate many light-signaling pathways, leading to the biosynthesis of important metabolites in plants. However, the identification of the BBX gene family and expression analysis in response to photoperiod-mediated carotenoid accumulation in cucumber remains unexplored. We performed a genome-wide study and determined the expression of cucumber BBX genes (hereafter referred to as CsaBBXs genes) in the endocarp of Xishuangbanna cucumber fruit (a special type of cucumber accumulating a high level of β-carotene in the endocarp) using an RNA-seq analysis of plants previously subjected to two photoperiodic conditions. Here, 26 BBX family genes were identified in the cucumber genome and named serially CsaBBX1 through CsaBBX26. We characterized CsaBBX genes in terms of their phylogenetic relationships, exon-intron structures, cis-acting elements, and syntenic relationships with Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. RNA-seq analysis revealed a varied expression of CsaBBX genes under photoperiod treatment. The analysis of CsaBBXs genes revealed a strong positive correlation between CsaBBX17 and carotenoid biosynthetic pathway genes (phytoene synthase, ζ-carotene desaturase, lycopene ε-cyclase, β-carotene hydroxylase-1), thus suggesting its involvement in β-carotene biosynthesis. Additionally, nine CsaBBX genes (CsaBBX 4,5,7,9,11, 13,15,17 and 22) showed a significant positive correlation with β-carotene content. The selected CsaBBX genes were verified by qRT-PCR and confirmed the validity of RNA-seq data. The results of this study established the genome-wide analysis of the cucumber BBX family and provide a framework for understanding their biological role in carotenoid accumulation and photoperiodic responses. Further investigations of CsaBBX genes are vital since they are promising candidate genes for the functional analysis of carotenoid biosynthesis and can provide genetic tools for the molecular breeding of carotenoids in plants.",

Although the most important factor in reducing lung cancer risk is lifestyle change, most patients favour the use of supplements, for example, rather than quitting smoking or following a healthy diet. To better understand the efficacy of such interventions, a systematic review was performed of data from randomized controlled trials concerning the influence of beta-carotene supplementation on lung cancer risk in subjects with no lung cancer before the intervention. The search corpus comprised a number of databases and eight studies involving 167,141 participants, published by November 2021. The findings indicate that beta-carotene supplementation was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer (RR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.06-1.26). This effect was even more noticeable among smokers and asbestos workers (RR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.08-1.35) and non-medics (RR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.07-1.29). A meta-regression found no relationship between the beta-carotene supplementation dose and the size of the negative effect associated with lung cancer risk. Our findings indicate that beta-carotene supplementation has no effect on lung cancer risk. Moreover, when used as the primary chemoprevention, beta-carotene may, in fact, increase the risk of lung cancer.",

      "abstract": "β-carotene is widely available in plant-based foods, while the efficacy of β-carotene supplementation on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk remains controversial. Hence, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on randomized controlled trials to investigate the associations between β-carotene supplementation and CVD risk as well as mortality. We conducted literature searches across eight databases and screened the publications from January 1900 to March 2022 on the topic of β-carotene treatments and cardiovascular outcomes. There were 10 trials and 16 reports included in the meta-analysis with a total of 182,788 individuals enrolled in the study. Results from the random-effects models indicated that β-carotene supplementation slightly increased overall cardiovascular incidence (RR: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.08) and was constantly associated with increased cardiovascular mortality (RR: 1.12; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.19). Subgroup analyses suggested that, when β-carotene treatments were given singly, a higher risk of cardiovascular outcomes was observed (RR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.12). In addition, cigarettes smoking was shown to be a risk behavior associated with increased cardiovascular incidence and mortality in the β-carotene intervention group. In sum, the evidence of this study demonstrated that β-carotene supplementation had no beneficial effects on CVD incidence and potential harmful effects on CVD mortality. Further studies on understanding the efficacy of multivitamin supplementation in nutrient-deficient or sub-optimal populations are important for developing the tolerable upper intake level for β-carotene of different age and sex groups.",

To combat VAD dietary interventions with β-carotene, the most abundant precursor of vitamin A, are recommended. However, the impact of β-carotene on intestinal health during VAD has not been fully clarified, especially regarding the VAD-associated intestinal dysbiosis. Here we addressed this question by using Lrat-/-Rbp-/- (vitamin A deficient) mice deprived of dietary preformed vitamin A and supplemented with β-carotene as the sole source of the vitamin, alongside with WT (vitamin A sufficient) mice. We found that dietary β-carotene impacted intestinal vitamin A status, barrier integrity and inflammation in both WT and Lrat-/-Rbp-/- (vitamin A deficient) mice on the vitamin A-free diet. However, it did so to a greater extent under overt VAD. Dietary β-carotene also modified the taxonomic profile of the fecal microbiome, but only under VAD. Given the similarity of the VAD-associated intestinal phenotypes with those of several other disorders of the gut, collectively known as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Syndrome, these findings are broadly relevant to the effort of developing diet-based intervention strategies to ameliorate intestinal pathological conditions.",

The vector p64DZ containing the β-carotene hydroxylase gene crtZ from Haematococcus pluvialis was transformed into C. reinhardtii CC-503. The transformants were selected by alternate culture in solid-liquid medium containing spectinomycin (100 µg mL-1). PCR results indicated that the gene crtZ and aadA were integrated into the genome of C. reinhardtii. RT-PCR analysis showed that the gene crtZ was transcribed in Chlamydomonas transformants. HPLC analysis showed that the content of astaxanthin and β-carotene in cells of C. reinhardtii were simultaneously increased. Under medium light intensity cultivation (60 µmol m-2 s-1), transgenic C. reinhardtii had an 85.8% increase in β-carotene content compared with the wild type. The content of astaxanthin and β-carotene reached 1.97 ± 0.13 mg g-1 fresh cell weight (FCW) and 105.94 ± 5.84 µg g-1 FCW, which were increased 18% and 42.4% than the wild type after 6 h of high light treatment (200 µmol m-2 s-1), respectively. Our results indicate the regulatory effect on pigments in C. reinhardtii by β-carotene hydroxylase gene of H. pluvialis, and demonstrate the positive effect of high light stress on pigment accumulation in transgenic C. reinhardtii.",

      "abstract": "High blood levels of β-carotene and increased intake in the diets are inversely proportional to incidence of many cancer types. Antioxidant activity of β-carotene was proposed to be related with its antitumor effect. Despite this plant derivative substance being sought in many cancer types, the effectiveness of β-carotene against malignant mesothelioma remained unclear. Therefore, the present study aims to explore the impact of β-carotene on cell viability, apoptosis, and oxidative stress in mesothelioma cells. Human mesothelioma cell SPC212 were treated with β-carotene (3.125-200 μM) for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. Cytotoxicity was measured with the MTT assay (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide). Annexin-V/propidium iodide (PI) and caspase 3/7 biomarkers were used to identify apoptotic cells. Finally, the oxidative stress was evaluated with flow cytometry. The results of the measurements indicated a significant decline in viable mesothelioma cancer cell numbers upon β-carotene treatment in time- and concentration-dependent manner when compared to control cells. Furthermore, β-carotene treatment led to apoptosis induction according to both annexin V/PI and caspase 3/7 assays. Furthermore, β-carotene increased oxidative stress in SPC212 cells. These results show how β-carotene affects proliferative, apoptotic, and oxidative properties in SPC212 malignant pleural mesothelioma cells and provide useful insights into future studies.",

The stability of emulsions under freeze-thaw treatment, high ionic strength conditions, thermal treatment and pH conditions near the isoelectric point of WPI were improved by glycation. The chemical stability of β-carotene in emulsions was also enhanced by WPI-GA conjugates. The WPI-GA conjugate-stabilized emulsions have better stability for droplet aggregation during in vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion, which increased β-carotene bioaccessibility. However, the Con WPI (U)-stabilized emulsion shows poor thermal stability and lower β-carotene bioaccessibility than the Con WPI (D)-stabilized emulsion, which may be attributed to ultrasound-induced structural changes during the process of glycation.",

C. ellipsoidea was cultured in Bold's Basal Medium for 18 days. The cell density (125.36×105 cells ml-1), cell dry weight (58.9 ± 4.57 mg L-1), optical density (1.66 ± 0.08 g L-1), chlorophyll-a (7.31 ± 0.04 μg ml-1), chlorophyll-b (2.73 ± 0.13 μg ml-1), and β-carotene (0.39 ± 0.04 μg ml-1) content of C. ellipsoidea were significantly (P < 0.05) higher at 15th-day when cultured under blue LED light exposure. Significantly lower growth and nutritional values were obtained under red LED light exposure compared to the control and other LEDs spectra. In Pearson correlation analysis, the cell density and cell dry weight values showed a strong positive correlation with the values of pigment contents of C. ellipsoidea in all the treatments. The LEDs light spectra showed significant effects on proximate composition of C. ellipsoidea. Protein and lipid contents of C. ellipsoidea were significantly higher in blue LED growth conditions compared to white, green, and red LEDs. C. ellipsoidea cells were 3-7.04 μm in size and the maximum area of the cell was 38.94 μm2 in blue LED treatment. Results of this study demonstrated that blue LED light spectra was the most suitable condition to induce nutritionally rich biomass production of C. ellipsoidea, which can be used as a potential source of fish feed towards sustainable aquaculture."

Previous studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of beta-carotene supplementation on bovine reproductive performance. This study was performed in Thailand, where the temperature-humidity index (THI) during the experimental periods was measured to range from 78.4 to 86.1. Lactating Holstein cows classified as repeat breeders (previous artificial insemination [AI] failures) were randomly assigned into two treatments, control treatment (T1; received placebo, n = 200) and test treatment (T2; received 400 mg/h/day of beta-carotene, n = 200). All cows were subjected to a protocol for synchronization of ovulation and timed artificial insemination (TAI). The day of the 1st ovulation synchronized protocol was defined as day 0, and the total experimental period was 160 days. Daily placebo or beta-carotene supplements were given orally on day 0 and each subsequent day of the experiment. Diagnosis of pregnancy was performed using ultrasound on day 30 after insemination. Non-pregnant cows were subjected to further ovulation synchronizations (maximum of four) and TAI over a period of 160 days. Milk samples were collected every ten days throughout the experiment. The samples were analyzed for beta-carotene concentration, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities. The pregnancies per AI of the cows in T2 were significantly greater than that of T1 from the 2nd to 4th TAI. During the entire experimental period, the pregnancies in T2 were significantly greater than that of T1. Cox's proportional hazards regression model data indicated a 44% greater probability of pregnancy for cows receiving beta-carotene. The concentrations of milk beta-carotene in T2 were significantly greater than T1 from the 2nd to 4th TAI. Significantly greater SOD and GPx activities were observed in T2 than T1, suggesting a reduction of oxidative stress in cows treated with beta-carotene. Dietary supplementation with beta-carotene thus improves the reproductive performance of repeat breeders exposed to heat stress, possibly by reducing oxidative stress.",

The vitamin A agent, β-carotene, is a well-known carotenoid, and its numerous functions in metabolism have been widely studied. The activation of thermogenesis by stimulating white fat browning (beiging) has been identified as a treatment for obese individuals. PURPOSE: The current study was undertaken to unveil the browning activity of β-carotene in 3T3-L1 white adipocytes. METHODS: The effects of β-carotene were evaluated in 3T3-L1 white adipocytes, and gene/protein expressions were determined by performing quantitative real-time PCR, immunoblot analysis, immunofluorescence assessment, and molecular docking techniques. RESULTS: β-carotene strikingly increased the expression levels of brown-fat-specific marker proteins (UCP1, PRDM16, and PGC-1α) and beige-fat-specific genes (Cd137, Cidea, Cited1, andTbx1) in 3T3-L1 cells. Exposure to β-carotene also elevated the expressions of key adipogenic transcription factors C/EBPα and PPARγ in white adipocytes but decreased the expressions of lipogenic marker proteins ACC and FAS. Moreover, lipolysis and fat oxidation were regulated by β-carotene via upregulation of ATGL, pHSL, ACOX, and CPT1. In addition, molecular docking studies revealed β-carotene activation of the adenosine A2A receptor and β3-AR. β-Carotene increased the expressions of mitochondrial biogenic markers, stimulated the β3-AR and p38 MAPK signaling pathways and its downstream signaling molecules (SIRTs and ATF2), thereby inducing browning. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results indicate the potential of β-carotene as a natural-source therapeutic anti-obesity agent.",

The cows under βC-supplemented treatments were fed 400 mg/day of βC, and a daily intake for vitamin A of HFβCA treatment was 30 000 IU/day as retinyl acetate. Blood was collected on days 0, 26, 27, and 28 to analyse βC and other metabolite concentrations. In Experiment 2, 199 Hanwoo cows with low fertility were randomly assigned to either control (n = 99) or HFβC treatments (n = 100) based on the results of Experiment 1. The oestrus of the cows was synchronised for ET. The HFβC group was fed from 4 weeks before to 4 weeks after ET with a daily intake of 400 mg βC. Pregnancy for conception rates was diagnosed on day 60 after ET, and blood was collected for βC concentrations on the day before ET. Supplementing βC resulted in a high plasma βC concentration (P < 0.001). Supplementing HFβC or HFβCA resulted in higher βC concentrations than HFuβC (P < 0.001); however, there was no difference between HFβC and HFβCA groups. Plasma retinol concentration was lower in the HFβCA treatment than in the control and HFβC groups (P < 0.05). Blood metabolites were unaffected by the treatments. The retinol:βC ratio was lower in the βC-supplemented treatments than in the controls, and was lower in HFβC and HFβCA than in HFuβC groups (P < 0.001). Plasma βC concentration was positively correlated with plasma high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, and total cholesterol (P < 0.05). Plasma retinol concentration was negatively associated with plasma protein (P < 0.01), but positively associated with plasma creatinine (P < 0.001) and urea (P < 0.01). Supplementing HFβC to low-fertility cows resulted in higher plasma βC concentration (P < 0.001) and conception rates (P = 0.024) than those in the controls. In conclusion, HFβC had a better bioavailability than HFuβC, and an increase in conception rates by supplementing HFβC may be beneficial for producing more calves given the low pregnancy rates of bovine ET in Korea.",

      "abstract": "Ontogenetic colour change occurs in a diversity of vertebrate taxa and may be closely linked to dietary changes throughout development. In various species, red, orange and yellow colouration can be enhanced by the consumption of carotenoids. However, a paucity of long-term dietary manipulation studies means that little is known of the role of individual carotenoid compounds in ontogenetic colour change. We know even less about the influence of individual compounds at different doses (dose effects). The present study aimed to use a large dietary manipulation experiment to investigate the effect of dietary β-carotene supplementation on colouration in southern corroboree frogs (Pseudophryne corroboree) during early post-metamorphic development. Frogs were reared on four dietary treatments with four β-carotene concentrations (0, 1, 2 and 3 mg g-1), with frog colour measured every 8 weeks for 32 weeks. β-Carotene was not found to influence colouration at any dose. However, colouration was found to become more conspicuous over time, including in the control treatment. Moreover, all frogs expressed colour maximally at a similar point in development. These results imply that, for our study species, (1) β-carotene may contribute little or nothing to colouration, (2) frogs can manufacture their own colour, (3) colour development is a continual process and (4) there may have been selection for synchronised development of colour expression. We discuss the potential adaptive benefit of ontogenetic colour change in P. corroboree. More broadly, we draw attention to the potential for adaptive developmental synchrony in the expression of colouration in aposematic species.",

We studied whether BC treatment at a closer to dietary dose and MET treatment at a lower than therapeutic dose are effective in ameliorating unwanted effects of an obesogenic diet and whether their combination is advantageous. Obesity-prone mice were challenged with a high-fat diet (HFD, 45% energy as fat) for 4 weeks while receiving a placebo or being treated orally with BC (3 mg/kg/day), MET (100 mg/kg/day), or their combination (BC+MET); a fifth group received a placebo and was kept on a normal-fat diet (10% energy as fat). HFD-induced increases in body weight gain and inguinal white adipose tissue (WAT) adipocyte size were attenuated maximally or selectively in the BC+MET group, in which a redistribution towards smaller adipocytes was noted. Cumulative energy intake was unaffected, yet results suggested increased systemic energy expenditure and brown adipose tissue activation in the treated groups. Unwanted effects of HFD on glucose control and insulin sensitivity were attenuated in the treated groups, especially BC and BC+MET, in which hepatic lipid content was also decreased. Transcriptional analyses suggested effects on skeletal muscle and WAT metabolism could contribute to better responses to the HFD, especially in the MET and BC+MET groups. The results support the benefits of the BC+MET cotreatment.",

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed that the interaction between SPI and pectin was enhanced and the crystallinity of the emulsion gels was changed due to the HIU treatment. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations revealed that the particle size of the emulsion gels was decreased significantly by HIU treatment. The emulsion gel structure became more uniform and denser, which was conducive to storage stability. In addition, according to the low field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) analysis, HIU treatment had no obvious impact on the content of bound water as the power increased to 450 W, while the content of free water decreased gradually and became immobilized water, which indicated that the water holding capacity of the emulsion gels was enhanced. Compared with untreated emulsion gel, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis showed that the denaturation temperature reached 131.9 ℃ from 128.2 ℃ when treated at 450 W. The chemical stability and bioaccessibility of β-carotene in the emulsion gels were improved significantly after HIU treatment during simulated in vitro digestion.",

The three main functions are antioxidant effects, cell gap junction-related functions and immune-related functions. Because of its diverse functions, beta-carotene is believed to prevent and treat many chronic diseases. Gastric cancer is one of the most important diseases it can treat. Gastric cancer is a type of cancer with a high incidence. Its etiology varies, and the pathogenesis is complex. Gastric cancer seriously affects human health. The role of beta-carotene, a natural nutrient, in gastric cancer has been explored by many researchers, including molecular mechanisms and epidemiological studies. Molecular studies have mainly focused on oxidative stress, cell cycle, signal transduction pathways and immune-related mechanisms of beta-carotene in gastric cancer. Many epidemiological surveys and cohort studies of patients with gastric cancer have been conducted, and the results of these epidemiological studies vary due to the use of different research methods and analysis of different regions. This paper will summarize the results of these studies, mainly in terms of molecular mechanisms and epidemiological research results, which will provide a systematic basis for future studies of the treatment and prognosis of gastric cancer. This paper will help researchers identify new research directions."

However, the in vivo bioavailability of Chlorella is still poorly evaluated. In this work, a human intervention study was conducted in 11 healthy men to evaluate the bioavailability of carotenoids within 3 days after the intake of a single dose (6 g) of dried marine Chlorella vulgaris containing lutein (7.08 mg), β-carotene (1.88 mg) and zeaxanthin (1.47 mg). Subjects were instructed to follow a low carotenoid diet during the experimental phase, starting 1 week earlier. On the day of the experiment, dried microalgae formulated in vegetarian hard capsules were ingested, and blood samples were collected up to 72 h for the analysis of plasma carotenoids concentration by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection. For all carotenoids, the estimated AUC and Cmax values were significantly different from zero (p < 0.05), indicating that a single dose of marine Chlorella vulgaris increased plasma concentrations of lutein (Cmin-corrected AUC = 1002 µg·h/L, Cmax = 20.4 µg/L), β-carotene (AUC = 1302 µg·h/L, Cmax = 34.9 µg/L) and zeaxanthin (AUC = 122.2 µg·h/L, Cmax = 3.4 µg/L). The bioavailability of other compounds, namely, polyunsaturated fatty acids and trace elements, was also assessed post-prandial for the first time, showing that linoleic acid, docosahexaenoic acid and iodine were absorbed after microalgae intake. These findings support the use of Chlorella vulgaris as a source of carotenoids, PUFA and essential trace elements with associated health benefits."

      "abstract": "Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impaired social interaction & communication as well as restricted and repetitive behavior. The currently reported incidence of ASD is 1-2%, and it increases dramatically to 10-20% in families predisposed to ASD. To date, there is no effective way to treat or prevent ASD, and only symptomatic treatment with limited efficacy is available. Oxytocin (Oxt) enhances affiliative behavior and improves social cognition. Social deficits characteristic of autism may be related to dysfunctional Oxt neurotransmission. Thus, administration of Oxt may relieve ASD, however it has a short plasma half-life and poor Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) permeability. CD38, a multifunctional ecto-enzyme expressed in brain and immune cells, was found to be critical for social behavior via regulation of Oxt secretion. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is a potent inducer of CD38 and improves social behavior, but it is toxic and teratogenic. We have shown that beta-carotene has a similar therapeutic effect. The present study aimed to investigate the activity of novel beta-carotene derivatives in rescuing low sociability found in BTBR mice, providing an in vivo \"proof of principle\" that beta-carotene derivatives are potential agents to prevent/ameliorate the reappearance of ASD in high-risk populations for ASD. Beta-carotene and its synthetic analogs were administered orally to newborn BTBR mice with ASD associated like behavior. After 2 months, they were tested (at dosages of 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg) by cognitive (T-maze spontaneous alteration and neurological score) and behavioral tests (reciprocal social interaction, repetitive grooming / bedding behavior), previously shown as indicators for autistic behavior. The following biochemical and molecular biology parameters were also examined: serum Oxt; gene expression in hippocampus and hypothalamus of CD 38, Oxt, Oxt receptor, BDNF, and retinoic acid receptor. The new compounds were significantly more effective than control. The most effective compounds, both in the behavioral tests and in their biochemical effects, were (3R,3'R)-astaxanthin bis(N-Cbz-l-alanine ester) (3B(and (3S,3'S)-astaxanthin bis(N,N-dimethylglycine ester (5). They did not exert any neurological symptoms. Thus, beta-carotene derivatives may have the potential to prevent and/or ameliorate autistic symptoms when administered orally after birth to newborns of families predisposed to autism.",

RESULTS: Vitamin E + C supplementation was found to increase the α-tocopherol levels by 40% but was associated with a 57% decrease in the γ-tocopherol isoform for all study groups (p < 0.001). The β -carotene was lower in the PE than in the normotensive and GH groups (p < 0.001) while the level of CoQ10 remained unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: A more personalized approach that target the suboptimal levels of specific antioxidants without disturbing the α/γ-tocopherol ratio could be a more successful approach to counteract oxidative stress in PE.",

      "abstract": "Dunaliella salina (D. salina) has been exploited as a novel expression system for the field of genetic engineering. However, owing to the low or inconsistent expression of target proteins, it has been greatly restricted to practical production of recombinant proteins. Since the accurate gene editing function of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas system, β-carotene hydroxylase gene was chosen as an example to explore D. salina application with the purpose of improving expression level of foreign genes. In this paper, based on pKSE401 backbone, three CRISPR/Cas9 binary vectors were constructed to targeting exon 1 and 3 of the β-carotene hydroxylase of D. salina CCAP19/18 (Dschyb). D. salina mutants were obtained by salt gradient transformation method, and the expression of Dschyb gene were identified through real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR. Moreover, carotenoids content was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography at different time points after high intensity treatment. Compared with wild type strains, the β-carotene levels of mutants showed a significant increase, nearly up to 1.4 μg/ml, and the levels of zeaxanthin decreased to various degrees in mutants. All the results provide a compelling evidence for targeted gene editing in D. salina. This study gave a first successful gene editing of D. salina which has a very important practical significance for increasing carotene yield and meeting realistic industry demand. Furthermore, it provides an approach to overcome the current obstacles of D. salina, and then gives a strong tool to facilitates the development and application of D. salina system."

      "abstract": "AIMS: To assess the effect of oral supplementation with fully oxidised β-carotene (OxBC) on bacteriological cure, the incidence of clinical mastitis, and somatic cell counts (SCC) in pasture-fed cows with subclinical intramammary infection. METHODS: Cows from four dairy herds were enrolled in early lactation if they had quarter-level SCC >200,000 cells/mL and they had a recognised bacterial intramammary pathogen in one or more quarters. They were randomly assigned to be individually fed from Day 0, for a mean of 40 days, with 0.5 kg of a cereal-based supplementary feed that either contained 300 mg of OxBC (treatment; n = 129 quarters) or did not (control; n = 135 quarters). Quarter-milk samples were collected on Days 21 and 42 for microbiology and SCC assessment. Bacteriological cure was defined as having occurred when the bacteria present on Day 0 were not isolated from samples collected on Days 21 or 42. A new intramammary infection was defined as a bacterial species isolated either on Day 21 or 42 differing from that isolated on Day 0. Clinical mastitis was diagnosed and recorded by herdowners up to Day 42. RESULTS: The bacteriological cure rate was greater for quarters from cows in the treatment group (13.9 (95% CI = 4.1-23.7)%) than for cows in the control group (6.9 (95% CI = 4.8-9.1)%; p = 0.02). The percentage of quarters that developed a new intramammary infection at Day 21 or 42 was greater for cows in the treatment group (17.9 (95% CI = 6.7-29.1)%) than for cows in the control group (13.0 (95% CI = 4.3-21.8)%; p < 0.01). The prevalence of quarters that were infected on Day 42 was less in cows in the treatment group (79.9 (95% CI = 62.3-97.6)%) than the control group (88.2 (95% CI = 78.4-97.9)%; p = 0.009). The incidence of quarters diagnosed with clinical mastitis by Day 42 was lower in cows from the treatment group (1/129 (0.78 (95% CI = 0.02-4.24)%)) than in cows from the control group (6/135 (4.44 (95% CI = 1.65-9.42)%; p = 0.03)). Mean quarter-level SCC was not statistically different between treatment groups (p = 0.34). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Feeding 300 mg/cow/day of OxBC resulted in a higher bacteriological cure rate, a lower prevalence of intramammary infection, and a lower incidence of clinical mastitis compared to untreated controls. However new intramammary infections increased in treated cows, and the magnitude of the increased bacteriological cure was low, resulting in 80% of cows remaining infected at Day 42. Therefore treatment with OxBC should be considered as an adjunct to other mastitis control measures.",

The purpose of this study was to establish the effect of ultrasound and steam treatment on the bioaccessibility of β-carotene, total polyphenols, antioxidant activity, polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase activity, and color in the orange-fleshed sweet potato juice. Sweet potato juice was processed using ultrasound (0.66 W cm-2 and 8 min), steam (2 min), and a combination of steam and ultrasound. The bioaccessibility of β-carotene was increased in processed sweet potato juice, with samples treated by ultrasound showing the highest bioaccessibility (76.6%). Processing had no effect on antioxidant or enzyme activity, but resulted in significant changes in the color of the juice. As a processing technology, ultrasound enables preservation or improvement of the quality of sweet potato juice, and when conbined with other treatments, facilitates the development of new products."

      "abstract": "β-Carotene displays antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and prevents the development of cancer. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a kind of inflammatory bowel disease that is accompanied by a certain risk of colon cancer. However, the role of β-carotene in the modulation of gut microbiota and UC improvement is unclear. In this research, the properties of β-carotene on anti-inflammatory and the composition of gut microbiota were evaluated in a rat model of UC induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). The results revealed that β-carotene significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the severity of colitis in rats, as assessed using body weight (6.00 ± 1.73%), colon length (22.23 ± 0.53%), and disease activity index, and improved the structure of the colon damaged. Moreover, colonic levels of proinflammatory cytokines were significantly lower following β-carotene supplementation. β-Carotene intervention also lowered the expression levels of phosphorylated p65 (0.60 ± 0.02), p38 (0.57 ± 0.00), Erk (0.63 ± 0.04), and JNK (0.70 ± 0.00). The result of the relative abundance of gut microbiota showed that DSS administration significantly changed the microbial structure at the phylum and genus levels of rats. Furthermore, β-carotene treatment significantly increased the abundance of Faecalibacterium, the levels of which negatively correlated with the levels of inflammatory cytokines. Faecalibacterium may be a potential target in the alleviation of DSS-induced UC. β-Carotene can alleviate DSS-induced UC through the regulation of gut microbiota. This study provides a reference for the rational use of β-carotene in the treatment of UC. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: β-Carotene can relieve ulcerative colitis and regulate the gut microbiota; the nutritional intervention of β-carotene enhancing animal health.",

      "abstract": "An extensive body of work has documented the antioxidant role of xanthophylls (lutein and zeaxanthin) in human health and specifically how they provide photoprotection in human vision. More recently, evidence is emerging for the transcriptional regulation of antioxidant response by lutein/lutein cleavage products, similar to the role of β-carotene cleavage products in the modulation of retinoic acid receptors. Supplementation with xanthophylls also provides additional benefits for the prevention of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and attenuation of Alzheimer's disease symptoms. Mammalian β-carotene oxygenase 2 (BCO2) asymmetrically cleaves xanthophylls as well as β-carotene in vitro. We recently demonstrated that mouse BCO2 (mBCO2) is a functionally palmitoylated enzyme and that it loses palmitoylation when cells are treated with β-carotene. The mouse enzyme is the easiest model to study mammalian BCO2 because it has only one isoform, unlike human BCO2 with several major isoforms with various properties. Here, we used the same acyl-RAC methodology and confocal microscopy to elucidate palmitoylation and localization status of mBCO2 in the presence of xanthophylls. We created large unilamellar vesicle-based nanocarriers for the successful delivery of xanthophylls into cells. We demonstrate here that, upon treatment with low micromolar concentration of lutein (0.15 µM), mBCO2 is depalmitoylated and shows partial nuclear localization (38.00 ± 0.04%), while treatment with zeaxanthin (0.45 µM) and violaxanthin (0.6 µM) induces depalmitoylation and protein translocation from mitochondria to a lesser degree (20.00 ± 0.01% and 35.00 ± 0.02%, respectively). Such a difference in the behavior of mBCO2 toward various xanthophylls and its translocation into the nucleus in the presence of various xanthophylls suggests a possible mechanism for transport of lutein/lutein cleavage products to the nucleus to affect transcriptional regulation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Egg proteins are effective emulsifiers and gelators in food systems. However, the physicochemical stability and control release properties of egg-protein stabilized emulsions and gels need to be further improved. The potential of sodium tripolyphosphate (St) to improve the functionality of egg proteins was evaluated. RESULTS: The emulsions with St had smaller particle sizes and higher zeta potential, leading to better physical stability. Furthermore, the oxidation stability increased with increasing St contents, possibly due to its metal chelating capacity and the improved emulsifying activity of whole-egg dispersions. Phosphate had a positive impact on the chemical stability of β-carotene in whole-egg liquids and gels, decreasing the degradation during thermal treatment. The gel made with St was firm and broke down slowly, leading to a low rate of digestion and β-carotene release in simulated gastric fluid. CONCLUSION: This study shows that St is useful to improve the egg proteins stabilized emulsions and gels, which is applicable in the development of emulsion-based food grade gel products. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "Melanoma is a type of highly invasive skin cancer derived from melanocytes with poor prognosis. Vemurafenib (PLX4032) is a clinically approved targeted therapeutic for BRAF mutant melanoma that has a high therapeutic response rate and significantly prolongs the overall survival time of patients with melanoma. Antioxidants have been widely used as supplements for cancer prevention and for decreasing the side effects of cancer therapy. However, antioxidants can also protect cancer cells from oxidative stress and promote cancer growth and progression. The present study aimed to examine the effect of the antioxidants coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and β-carotene on melanoma cell growth and invasiveness and on the cytotoxicity of vemurafenib against both vemurafenib-sensitive (SK-MEL-28) and vemurafenib-resistant (A2058) human malignant melanoma cell lines. MTS assay and wound-healing assay demonstrated that CoQ10 alone significantly reduced the viability and migration of melanoma cells, respectively, and synergistically worked with vemurafenib to decrease the viability and migration of human melanoma cells. In contrast, MTS assay and flow cytometry revealed that β-carotene alone did not affect the viability and apoptosis induction of melanoma cells; however, it inhibited cell migration and invasiveness. Wound-healing and Transwell assay demonstrated that β-carotene alleviated the cytotoxicity of vemurafenib and mitigated the inhibitory effect of vemurafenib on cell migration and invasion. Both CoQ10 and β-carotene protected melanoma cells from undergoing apoptosis induced by vemurafenib. Immunoblotting demonstrated that β-carotene at physiological concentration worked synergistically with vemurafenib to suppress the Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk intracellular signaling pathway. The present study aimed to add to the evidence of the in vitro effects of CoQ10 and β-carotene on the antimelanoma effects of vemurafenib."
