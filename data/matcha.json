      "abstract": "Abundant direct and in-direct genes are involved in regulating sexual hormones, and reproductive process under nitrite antioxidant plants in rabbit feed. However, there is not enough information about the role of chia seeds and matcha tea as anti-oxidative plants inhibit some direct and in-direct genes related to puberty of growing male rabbits. In this study New-Zealand White (NZW) rabbits treated with chia seeds and matcha tea in water from age after weaning to marketing age about two months ago and determent some sexual hormones, direct and in-direct genes related to puberty and reproduction process. Our data showed total testosterone measured by ELISA increased significantly in chia rabbits compared to control. ELISA analysis revealed that there were no alterations in the levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) in the treated groups. Direct genes such as doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1 (DMRT1), sex-determining region Y protein (SRY), and gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (GnRH1) determent by qPCR show up-regulating in matcha groups comparable to control group. While in-direct genes follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) and estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) detected by qPCR showed up-regulated in matcha rabbits compared to control rabbits. But, luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) gene was down-regulated in matcha group, and it was up-regulated in chia seeds groups. The prolactin receptor (PRLR) gene investigates down-regulation in all treatment groups. Collectively, matcha tea as one of antioxidant plants were involved those genes studied and activated via hypothalamic- pituitary gonadal axis and led to early puberty in growing male NZW rabbits.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Lifestyle habits after middle age significantly impact the maintenance of cognitive function in older adults. Nutritional intake is closely related to lifestyle habits; therefore, nutrition is a pivotal factor in the prevention of dementia in the preclinical stages. Matcha green tea powder (matcha), which contains epigallocatechin gallate, theanine, and caffeine, has beneficial effects on cognitive function and mood. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study over 12 months to examine the effect of matcha on cognitive function and sleep quality. METHODS: Ninety-nine participants, including 64 with subjective cognitive decline and 35 with mild cognitive impairment were randomized, with 49 receiving 2 g of matcha and 50 receiving a placebo daily. Participants were stratified based on two factors: age at baseline and APOE genotype. Changes in cognitive function and sleep quality were analyzed using a mixed-effects model. RESULTS: Matcha consumption led to significant improvements in social acuity score (difference; -1.39, 95% confidence interval; -2.78, 0.002) (P = 0.028) as evaluated by the perception of facial emotions in cognitive function. The primary outcomes, that is, Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activity of Daily Living scores, showed no significant changes with matcha intervention. Meanwhile, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores indicated a trend toward improvement with a difference of 0.86 (95% confidence interval; -0.002, 1.71) (P = 0.088) between the groups in changes from baseline to 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests regular consumption of matcha could improve emotional perception and sleep quality in older adults with mild cognitive decline. Given the widespread availability and cultural acceptance of matcha green tea, incorporating it into the daily routine may offer a simple yet effective strategy for cognitive enhancement and dementia prevention.",

However, there are several challenges that must be addressed in the quality of matcha-incorporated foods, with the most significant being the prevention of matcha discoloration. In this study, we introduce a novel approach involving the incorporation of matcha with whey protein (0.08 g/mL) and carboxymethyl chitosan (0.04 g/mL), accompanied by microwave treatment at 700 W for 60 s of wheat flour to produce color-stable matcha fresh noodles. All steps involved in the production process of matcha fresh noodles are presented in the article, including matcha embedding treatment, microwave treatment of wheat flour, kneading the dough, leaving to prove, dividing the dough, rolling out the dough and slicing the sheets by noodle press. The findings revealed a 72.13% reduction in discoloration of fresh matcha noodles following embedding and microwave treatment, compared to untreated fresh matcha noodles. Moreover, the combined process did not have any detrimental impact on the sensory attributes of matcha noodles, including their aroma and taste. Therefore, the novel method proposed in this study holds significant potential for enhancing the color stability of fresh matcha noodles during preparation.",

According to the data analyzed, treatment with matcha extract was effective in increasing the nutritional value of native rice starch. At the highest level of extract addition, total phenolic and flavonoid content reached 129.54 mg/100 g and 40.16 mg/100 g, respectively, as no phenolic or flavonoid content was detected in control. In addition, the highest DPPH and FRAP values were determined to be 296.62 μmol TE/100 g and 814.89 mg/100 g, respectively, at the highest extract addition level. Treatment with matcha extract significantly reduced the eGI of native rice starch from to 94.61 to 64.63, while resistant starch was increased from 0.90 to 33.43%. According to the physiochemical analysis, there was a positive correlation between the extract ratio and the water-holding capacity of rice starch due to the high hydrophilic capacity of the phenolic compounds. In addition, the solubility and swelling power of starch were increased by treatment with matcha extract, but high temperatures had a negative effect on these physicochemical properties."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Porphyromonas gingivalis has been associated with progression of periodontitis, characterized by inflammation and destruction of periodontal tissues. Here, we report that matcha, a product of Camellia sinensis, hampers the adherence and survival of P. gingivalis through multiple tactics. Matcha extract (ME) inhibited the growth not only of P. gingivalis but also of Prevotella nigrescens and Fusobacterium nucleatum, while it did not inhibit growth of nine species of oral streptococci and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. ME-mediated P. gingivalis growth inhibition was characterized by both morphological and physiological changes at the bacterial envelope, which were accompanied by nano-particle formation and decreased membrane fluidity/permeability without loss of membrane integrity. ME also triggered autoaggregation of P. gingivalis in a major fimbriae (FimA)-dependent manner. In addition, adherence of P. gingivalis was dramatically inhibited by ME, irrespective of fimbriae. Furthermore, a structure-activity relationship study tested a series of catechins isolated from ME and identified the pyrogallol-type B-ring of catechins as essential for P. gingivalis growth inhibition. In a clinical study to assess the microbiological and therapeutic effects of matcha mouthwash in patients with periodontitis, the P. gingivalis number in saliva was significantly reduced by matcha mouthwash compared to the pre-intervention level. A tendency toward improvement in probing pocket depth was observed in the matcha group, although the difference was not statistically significant. Taken together, we present a proof of concept, based on the multimodal inhibitory effect of matcha against P. gingivalis, and that matcha may have clinical applicability for prevention and treatment of periodontitis. IMPORTANCE: Periodontitis, a multifactorial inflammatory disease of the oral cavity, results in alveolar bone destruction, and is a major cause of tooth loss of humans. In addition, emerging evidence has demonstrated associations between periodontitis and a wide range of other chronic inflammation-driven disorders, including diabetes mellitus, preterm birth, cardiovascular disease, aspiration pneumonia, rheumatoid arthritis, cognitive disorder, and cancer. In the present study, we report that matcha, a product of Camellia sinensis, hampers Porphyromonas gingivalis, a major periodontal pathobiont, in not only a series of in vitro experiments but also a pilot intervention clinical trial of patients with periodontitis, in which matcha mouthwash statistically significantly reduced the P. gingivalis number in saliva, as compared to the pre-intervention level. Taken together, we suggest that matcha may have clinical applicability for prevention and treatment of periodontitis.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The primary objective of this study was to conduct a comparative analysis of the anti-inflammatory activity between Etoricoxib (ETO) and Matcha green tea (MG) in the context of acute kidney injury (AKI) induced by ionizing gamma radiation (IR) in female rats. Furthermore, the potential impact of whole body IR exposure on the intestinal system and serum estradiol levels was investigated. Additionally, it was acknowledged that the ETO and MG treatments might have exerted favorable effects on the intestinal and hormonal responses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six groups of rats were assigned to different treatments: control, ETO, MG, irradiation (IRR), ETO + IRR, and MG + IRR. The evaluation included measuring the total phenolic and flavonoid contents of ETO and MG, as well as assessing their antioxidant activity, radical scavenging capacity, reducing power, and total antioxidant capacity. Kidney function was assessed through serum creatinine and urea levels. Oxidative stress markers, including superoxide dismutase, glutathione, malondialdehyde, and catalase, were measured to evaluate the antioxidant effects of ETO and MG. The anti-inflammatory potential of the treatments was evaluated by measuring STAT-3 and interleukins (IL-6, IL-23, and IL-17) using an ELISA assay. Prostaglandin E2 receptor (PGE-2) mRNA expression, histopathological examination, and immunohistochemistry for NF-κB inhibitors were performed to investigate the underlying mechanisms in kidney tissue homogenates. Histopathological changes and DNA fragmentation in the intestinal tissues were determined, and the characterization of Matcha green tea was performed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). This allowed for the identification and quantification of various compounds present in Matcha green tea. Furthermore, the study assessed the effect of IR and treatments on estrogen levels in female rats. RESULTS: Data showed that both ETO and MG had the potential to mitigate the adverse effects of AKI induced by IR. Notably, MG exhibited greater efficacy in attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation associated with renal injury. These findings revealed and compared the effects of ETO and MG in alleviating AKI caused by IR. MG demonstrated greater anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, highlighting its potential as a natural therapeutic agent. CONCLUSIONS: These results contribute to the growing evidence supporting the use of MG in managing IR-induced renal complications. Future studies should focus on elucidating the molecular mechanisms and optimizing the application of MG in clinical settings.",

Also, the content of phenolic ingredients, i.e., selected phenolic acids, flavonoids and total polyphenols, was assessed. The content of chlorophyll, vitamin C and antioxidant potential were also examined. Matcha M-4 was used to design two functional model beverages, in the form of ready-to-use powdered drinks, consisting of Matcha green tea, protein preparations, inulin, maltodextrin and sugar. The obtained powdered drink, when dissolved in the preferred liquid (water, milk, juice), is regenerative, high-protein and rich in bioactive ingredients from the Matcha drink, with prebiotic properties derived from the added inulin. The beverage is also characterized by low osmolality. It can be recommended as a regenerating beverage for a wide group of consumers, athletes and people with deficiencies, among others protein, and elderly people, as well as in the prevention and supportive treatment of bone and joint tissue diseases.",

Dietary intervention with natural foods provides nutrients that help accelerate muscle adaptation to training. Matcha green tea contains several bioactive factors such as antioxidants, amino acids, and dietary fibers; however, its effect on muscle adaptation is unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of matcha beverage intake on muscle adaptation to resistance training. METHODS: Healthy, untrained men were randomized into placebo and matcha groups. Participants consumed either a matcha beverage containing 1.5 g of matcha green tea powder or a placebo beverage twice a day and engaged in resistance training programs for 8 (trial 1) or 12 weeks (trial 2). RESULTS: In trial 1, maximum leg strength after training tended to increase more in the matcha group than that in the placebo group. In the matcha group, subjective fatigue after exercise at 1 week of training was lower than that in the placebo group. Gut microbe analysis showed that the abundance of five genera changed after matcha intake. The change in Ruminococcus, Butyricimonas, and Oscillospira compositions positively correlated with the change in maximum strength. In trial 2, the change in skeletal muscle mass in response to training was larger in the matcha group. In addition, the salivary cortisol level was lower in the matcha group than that in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: Daily intake of matcha green tea beverages may help in muscle adaptation to training, with modulations in stress and fatigue responses and microbiota composition.",

The properties of matcha are influenced by cultivation method and processing post-harvest. The transition from drinking tea infusion to eating whole leaves provides a healthy option for the delivery of functional component and tea phenolics in various food matrix. The aim of this review is to describe the physico-chemical properties of matcha, the specific requirements for tea cultivation and industrial processing. The quality of matcha mainly depends on the quality of fresh tea leaves, which is affected by preharvest factors including tea cultivar, shading treatment, and fertilization. Shading is the key measure to increase greenness, reduce bitterness and astringency, and enhance umami taste of matcha. The potential health benefits of matcha and the gastrointestinal fate of main phenolics in matcha are covered. The chemical compositions and bioactivities of fiber-bound phenolics in matcha and other plant materials are discussed. The fiber-bound phenolics are considered promising components which endow matcha with boosted bioavailability of phenolics and health benefits through modulating gut microbiota.",

Moreover, shading increased the theanine and caffeine contents, while decreasing the polyphenol (epicatechin and epigallocatechin) contents, thereby optimizing matcha tea flavors. A total of 2788 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, of which 1151 and 1637 were respectively upregulated and downregulated in response to shading. The GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that most of the DEGs were associated with metabolic processes (e.g., MAPK signaling, plant-pathogen interactions, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis). Therefore, shading may modulate tea plant metabolism, signaling, biosynthetic activities, and environment-related changes to gene transcription. The expression of amino acid permeases (APP) encoding genes was downregulated in tea plants. Thus, shading influences theanine biosynthesis and the AAP-mediated distribution of theanine in tea plants.",

      "abstract": "Obesity induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) is an increasing global health problem, leading to many metabolic syndromes. As the emerging food additive rich in tea polyphenols, theanine, caffeine, and so on, matcha green tea has gained more and more popularity for its outstanding potential in ameliorating metabolic disorders. This study investigated the composition and antioxidant activity of matcha green tea and further explored its effects on gut-liver axis homeostasis in an HFD-induced obese mouse model. Male (7-8 weeks old) C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups with the following dietary supplementation for 8 weeks: a normal chow diet (NCD), a normal chow diet+1.0% matcha (NCM), a high-fat diet (HFD), and a high-fat diet+1.0% matcha (HFM). The results demonstrated that matcha green tea ameliorated the development of obesity, lipid accumulation, and hepatic steatosis induced by HFD. Subsequently, dietary matcha supplementation restored the alterations in fecal bile acid profile and gut microbial composition. Meanwhile, the levels of mRNA expression in hepatocytes demonstrated that matcha intervention made significant regulatory on the multiple metabolic pathways of hosts involved in glucose, lipid, and bile acid metabolism. These findings present new evidence for matcha green tea as an effective nutritional strategy to mitigate obesity and relevant metabolic disorders through the gut-liver axis."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Matcha green tea (Camellia sinensis) based-supplements have been widely used since they present a greater content of phenolic compounds than traditional green tea, which is popularly used in the treatment of diabetes. However, there are few studies on the effectiveness and safety of matcha supplements. AIM OF THE STUDY: This work aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this supplement in endothelial cells (EA.hy926) in the hyperglycemic model and in vivo Artemia salina. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To assess the effect of Matcha herbal supplement (MHS), EA. hy926 endothelial cells were treated with 20 μg/mL of MHS for 24 h, in a hyperglycemic medium with 35 mM glucose. After treatment, cells were trypsinized and centrifuged at 4 °C and 47×g for 5 min. The pellet was used to determine the reaction products to thiobarbituric acid and the levels of nitric oxide. Electron transport chain activity and ATP levels were also evaluated. Intracellular pH, apoptosis, and mitochondrial membrane depolarization were evaluated by flow cytometry. MHS chemical characterization was performed by HPLC-UV and total phenolic content analysis. The evaluation of the antioxidant capacity of MHS was performed by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenger assay. To determine the in vivo acute toxicity of MHS, an A. salina assay was conducted, using 0,2 mL of different concentrations of MHS (10, 50, 100, 250, 500, 750 and 1000 μg/mL). The LD50 values were obtained by interpolation of 50% (y = 50) of the dead individuals in the trend curves. RESULTS: Our data showed that MHS was able to avoid oxidative and nitrosative stress induced by hyperglycemia, demonstrating important antioxidant activity. However, it was observed that MHS reduced up to 90% the activity of the four-electron transport complexes, reducing the ATP production of the endothelial cells. In the toxicity assay performed in Artemia salina, MHS showed mild toxicity (LD50 = 0,4 mg/mL). The major compounds found in MHS were epigallocatechin gallate, epicatechin, rutin, kaempferol, and quercetin. CONCLUSIONS: This data draws attention to the fact that supplements with high content of phenolic compounds, capable of avoiding oxidative and nitrosative stress can have a dual effect and, simultaneously to antioxidant activity, can induce toxicity in different cell types.",

The weight loss effects of matcha tea were evaluated in a prospective non-randomized open-label comparative study of overweight and obese individuals who followed a specified low-calorie diet (LCD) plan. A total of 40 participants were enrolled and assigned to either matcha tea or control groups. The matcha tea group followed a LCD plan and received matcha tea once daily, whereas the control group followed only the LCD diet plan. The study lasted 12 weeks. The main outcome measures included anthropometric measurements, fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), lipid profile, obesity-related hormone peptides, pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress biomarkers. Thirty-four participants had completed the study. The matcha tea and control groups showed significant reductions in body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, water content, minerals, and fat mass at week 12. The post-treatment body composition and anthropometric measurements were not significantly different between the two groups. The matcha tea group showed a potential increase in HDL-C, a potential decrease in blood glucose, and a potential increase in HbA1c. Furthermore, the study indicated a potential decrease in insulin and leptin levels, a potential increase in the activity of superoxide dismutase, and a potential decreased activity of glutathione peroxidase. IL-10 was increased by matcha tea consumption. The data suggest that matcha tea may have some potential effect on weight loss, along with anti-inflammatory properties. The findings of this study will be used to design a multicenter randomized clinical trial to examine the potential weight loss benefits of matcha tea.",

      "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae is a causative pathogen of several human infectious diseases including community-acquired pneumonia. Pneumolysin (PLY), a pore-forming toxin, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of pneumococcal pneumonia. In recent years, the use of traditional natural substances for prevention has drawn attention because of the increasing antibacterial drug resistance of S. pneumoniae. According to some studies, green tea exhibits antibacterial and antitoxin activities. The polyphenols, namely the catechins epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin gallate (ECG), and epicatechin (EC) are largely responsible for these activities. Although matcha green tea provides more polyphenols than green tea infusions, its relationship with pneumococcal pneumonia remains unclear. In this study, we found that treatment with 20 mg/mL matcha supernatant exhibited significant antibacterial activity against S. pneumoniae regardless of antimicrobial resistance. In addition, the matcha supernatant suppressed PLY-mediated hemolysis and cytolysis by inhibiting PLY oligomerization. Moreover, the matcha supernatant and catechins inhibited PLY-mediated neutrophil death and the release of neutrophil elastase. These findings suggest that matcha green tea reduces the virulence of S. pneumoniae in vitro and may be a promising agent for the treatment of pneumococcal infections."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Green tea is associated with decreased risk for cardiovascular disease and stroke. Matcha is a special kind of powdered green tea known for its use in the Japanese tea ceremony. Due to its influence on lipoprotein parameters, it has been postulated to exert antiatherogenic effects. This study investigates whether it modulates the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) function and thereby influences the atherogenic process in an animal model with a strong influence on humans' situation. METHODS AND RESULTS: After a pretreatment phase based on a standard diet, 10 female New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits are fed a high-fat diet for 20 weeks. The treatment group is additionally administered 1% matcha during the whole experiment. Long-term matcha treatment leads to lowered HDL cholesterol, impaired cholesterol transport manifested by reduced in vitro cholesterol efflux capacity, reduced cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP)-mediated cholesterol ester (CE) transfer between HDL and triglyceride-rich particles, and reduced macrophage-specific in vivo transfer, where ian increased absorption of cholesterol in the liver but a decreased secretion into bile is observed. Pulse wave velocity, assessed by nuclear magnetic resonance, is increased in matcha-treated animals, and a similar trend is observed for atherosclerotic lesion formation. CONCLUSION: Long-term matcha green tea treatment of hypercholesterolemic rabbits cause impaired reverse cholesterol transport and increased vascular stiffness, and susceptibility for atherosclerotic lesion development.",

However, the underlying mechanisms of its control effects against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are complicated and remain elusive. In the present study, we performed an in vivo experiment using male C57BL/6 mice fed with a high-fat diet and simultaneously treated with matcha for six weeks. Serum biochemical parameters, histological changes, lipid accumulation, inflammatory cytokines, and relevant indicators were examined. Dietary supplementation of matcha effectively prevented excessive accumulation of visceral and hepatic lipid, elevated blood glucose, dyslipidemia, abnormal liver function, and steatosis hepatitis. RNA sequencing analyses of differentially expressed genes in liver samples indicated that matcha treatment decreased the activity of lipid droplet-associated proteins and increased the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes, suggesting improved metabolic capacity and liver function. The current study provided evidence for new dietary strategies based on matcha supplementation to ameliorate lipotoxicity-induced obesity and NALFD.",

The present study investigated the therapeutic effects of Spirulina platensis (SP) and matcha green tea (MGT) in Schistosoma mansoni-infected mice combined with tracing their possible antioxidant and anti-inflammatory impacts and their protective potency. A total of 60 Swiss albino mice were randomly allocated into six groups (n = 10): control group (CNT, received normal saline); SP-MGT group [received oral SP (3 g/kg bodyweight/day) plus MGT (3 g/kg bodyweight/day)]; S. mansoni group (infected with S. mansoni cercariae, 100 ± 10/mouse, using the tail immersion method); SP-infected group (infected with S. mansoni and received oral SP); MGT-infected group (received oral MGT after S. mansoni infection); and SP-MGT-infected group (received combined treatment of SP and MGT after S. mansoni infection). Treatment with SP and MGT started 4 weeks after S. mansoni infection and ended 10 weeks after. SP and MGT treatment (SP-infected and MGT-infected groups) and the combined treatment (SP-MGT-infected group) minimized the hepatic damage induced by S. mansoni; circulating alanine aminotransferase and aspartate transaminase decreased, and total protein, albumin, and globulin serum levels increased. The serum level of malondialdehyde significantly declined, and catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and total antioxidant capacity increased in SP-infected, MGT-infected, and SP-MGT-infected groups compared with the infected group. Co-administration of SP and MGT reduced serum cytokine levels (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, and interleukin-13) and increased interleukin-10 levels after S. mansoni infection compared with the infected group. Moreover, treatment with SP and/or MGT decreased the number of granulomas in hepatic and splenic tissues compared with the infected group. Collectively, our results suggest that combined SP and MGT treatment is effective for S. mansoni infection. Liver and spleen tissue alterations were improved, the antioxidant systems were stimulated, and the inflammatory response was suppressed. Further research is recommended to investigate the mechanisms of the combined SP and MGT treatment effects to facilitate the development of novel therapies against this disease."

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microscopy was used to analyze chemical changes in the trophozoites and cysts due to C. sinensis treatment. Hot brewed and cold brewed matcha inhibited the growth of trophozoites by >40% at a 100 % concentration. EGCg at concentrations of 50 to 500 µM significantly inhibited the trophozoite growth compared to control. Hot brewed matcha (100% concentration) also showed an 87% reduction in the rate of encystation compared to untreated control. Although 500 µM of EGCg increased the rate of encystation by 36.3%, 1000 µM reduced it by 27.7%. Both percentages were not significant compared to control. C. sinensis induced more cytotoxicity to Madin Darby canine kidney cells compared to EGCg. FTIR chemical fingerprinting analysis showed that treatment with brewed matcha significantly increased the levels of glycogen and carbohydrate in trophozoites and cysts."

      "abstract": "Matcha green tea (MGT) is a natural product that is currently used as a dietary supplement and may have significant anti-cancer properties. However, the molecular mechanism(s) underpinning its potential health benefits remain largely unknown. Here, we used MCF7 cells (an ER(+) human breast cancer cell line) as a model system, to systematically dissect the effects of MGT at the cellular level, via i) metabolic phenotyping and ii) unbiased proteomics analysis. Our results indicate that MGT is indeed sufficient to inhibit the propagation of breast cancer stem cells (CSCs), with an IC-50 of ~0.2 mg/ml, in tissue culture. Interestingly, metabolic phenotyping revealed that treatment with MGT is sufficient to suppress both oxidative mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS) and glycolytic flux, shifting cancer cells towards a more quiescent metabolic state. Unbiased label-free proteomics analysis identified the specific mitochondrial proteins and glycolytic enzymes that were down-regulated by MGT treatment. Moreover, to discover the underlying signalling pathways involved in this metabolic shift, we subjected our proteomics data sets to bio-informatics interrogation via Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. Our results indicate that MGT strongly affected mTOR signalling, specifically down-regulating many components of the 40S ribosome. This raises the intriguing possibility that MGT can be used as inhibitor of mTOR, instead of chemical compounds, such as rapamycin. In addition, other key pathways were affected, including the anti-oxidant response, cell cycle regulation, as well as interleukin signalling. Our results are consistent with the idea that MGT may have significant therapeutic potential, by mediating the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells.",

      "abstract": "Matcha tea is gaining popularity throughout the world in recent years and is frequently referred to as a mood-and-brain food. Previous research has demonstrated that three constituents present in matcha tea, l-theanine, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and caffeine, affect mood and cognitive performance. However, to date there are no studies assessing the effect of matcha tea itself. The present study investigates these effects by means of a human intervention study administering matcha tea and a matcha containing product. Using a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind study, 23 consumers participated in four test sessions. In each session, participants consumed one of the four test products: matcha tea, matcha tea bar (each containing 4g matcha tea powder), placebo tea, or placebo bar. The assessment was performed at baseline and 60min post-treatment. The participants performed a set of cognitive tests assessing attention, information processing, working memory, and episodic memory. The mood state was measured by means of a Profile of Mood States (POMS). After consuming the matcha products compared to placebo versions, there were mainly significant improvements in tasks measuring basic attention abilities and psychomotor speed in response to stimuli over a defined period of time. In contrast to expectations, the effect was barely present in the other cognitive tasks. The POMS results revealed no significant changes in mood. The influence of the food matrix was demonstrated by the fact that on most cognitive performance measures the drink format outperformed the bar format, particularly in tasks measuring speed of spatial working memory and delayed picture recognition. This study suggests that matcha tea consumed in a realistic dose can induce slight effects on speed of attention and episodic secondary memory to a low degree. Further studies are required to elucidate the influences of the food matrix.",

Healthy dogs without periodontitis, of varying breeds, sex, and age, were recruited and enrolled, using nonrandomized stratification methods, into a control and treatment groups. Treatment group dogs drank only water into which OCP was suspended, for 28 days. Control group dogs drank their normal household water. On day 0 all teeth were cleaned by a veterinarian and gingivitis was assessed. On days 14, 21, and 28 plaque index, plaque thickness, gingivitis, freshness of breath, and general health were assessed. Over the 28 days of study, dogs on the OCP had significant reduction in plaque index and plaque thickness compared to controls. By day 14 OCP reduced plaque formation by 37%; the 28-day reduction in plaque index and coverage averaged 22% with no measurable gingivitis or calculus. Conclusion. Using the OCP attenuated dental plaque formation when consumed as normal drinking water and in the absence of other modes of oral care."

      "abstract": "Matcha, a powdered green tea produced by grinding with a stone mill, has been popularly used in the traditional tea ceremony and foods in Japan. Matcha is well known to be richer in some nutritional elements and epigallocatechin 3-O-gallate than other green teas. In our previous study, epigallocatechin 3-O-gallate exhibited protective effects against renal damage in a rat model of diabetic nephropathy. In the present study, we investigated the preventive effects of Matcha (50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day) on the progression of hepatic and renal damage in type 2 diabetic Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats. OLETF rats were orally administered Matcha for 16 weeks, and we assessed biochemical parameters in the serum, liver, and kidney and expression levels of major products of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), N(6)-(carboxylmethyl)lysine (CML) and N(6)-(carboxylethyl)lysine (CEL), receptor for AGE (RAGE), and sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs)-1 and -2. Serum total protein levels were significantly increased by Matcha administration, whereas the serum albumin and glycosylated protein levels as well as the renal glucose and triglyceride levels were only slightly or not at all affected. However, Matcha treatment significantly lowered the glucose, triglyceride, and total cholesterol levels in the serum and liver, renal AGE levels, and the serum thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances levels. In addition, Matcha supplementation resulted in decreases in the renal CML, CEL, and RAGE expressions as well as an increase in hepatic SREBP-2 expression, but not that of SREBP-1. These results suggest that Matcha protects against hepatic and renal damage through the suppression of renal AGE accumulation, by decreases in hepatic glucose, triglyceride, and total cholesterol levels, and by its antioxidant activities.",

The rats were given a treatment diet containing 10% matcha for the first five days. Then, the animals were administered 4 g of 10% matcha diet containing 0.5 ml of the casual rice-bran oil of Yusho that had occurred in the Southwest part of Japan in 1968 and kept on the same diet for another five days. The fecal excretion of PCB, PCDF and PCDD in the group fed with 10% matcha were 4.4, 2.4-9.1 and 2.5-4.7 times higher (p < 0.01), respectively, than that in the control group. The liver distribution of PCB, PCDF and PCDD in the same groups were 79%, 20-75% and 26-67% of the control group, respectively. These findings suggest that administration of matcha is useful as a treatment of Yusho patients exposed to PCB, PCDF and PCDD.",
