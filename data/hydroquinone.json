Due to the differences between Chinese and Caucasian subjects, further clinical trials in Chinese patients with melasma are needed. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of fluocinolone acetonide, hydroquinone, and tretinoin creams in Chinese patients with moderate-to-severe melasma. METHODS: We recruited 53 patients who received a generic formulation (triple combination cream, TCC), brand formulation (TRI-LUMA), or placebo once daily for 8 weeks. In weeks 4 and 8, efficacy was evaluated based on the Melasma Severity Scale and Melasma Area and Severity Index. In addition, safety was assessed based on the incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events. RESULTS: The generic TCC group achieved 52.2% efficacy compared to 57.1% in the TRI-LUMA group. There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse effects between the TCC and TRI-LUMA groups (69.6% and 90.5%, respectively; p > 0.05). The incidence of adverse events in the placebo group was 0%. CONCLUSION: Generic TCC was as effective as TRI-LUMA and had a similar safety profile in this study of Chinese subjects with moderate-to-severe melasma.",

(T. chebula) has shown antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and tyrosinase enzyme inhibitory activities. So, the present study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of T. chebula 5% cream compared to hydroquinone 2% cream in treating patients with melasma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The formulation of T. chebula 5% cream was prepared. The stability and release study of the cream were performed. In this randomized, controlled, triple-blind clinical trial, participants with facial melasma were randomly assigned to receive T. chebula 5% cream or hydroquinone 2% cream at bedtime for 12 weeks. Modified Melasma Area and Severity Index (mMASI) scores were recorded for all the participants at the baseline and 4, 8, and 12 weeks after initiating the study. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences regarding mMASI scores were detected between T. chebula and hydroquinone groups at each time point. The reduction in mMASI scores was statistically significant (p<0.05) in T. chebula group 4, 8, and 12 weeks after initiating the study. However, it reached statistical significance (p<0.05) in hydroquinone group 8, and 12 weeks after the study initiation. The frequencies of side effects especially skin irritation were significantly (p<0.05) lower in T. chebula group. CONCLUSION: T. chebula 5% cream could be as effective as hydroquinone 2% cream in treating melasma with fewer side effects."

      "abstract": "Pain hypersensitivity is a hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, the underlying mechanisms and effective therapies remain largely undefined. Emerging studies suggest that neutrophils play a significant role in the pathology of RA, yet their involvement in RA-associated pain is still unclear. The present study investigates whether neutrophil activity contributes to pain pathogenesis in RA. Our flow cytometry analysis reveals that the accumulation and N1 polarization (indicated by the ratio of CD45+CD66b+CD95+ subset) of neutrophils occur in synovial fluid samples from RA patients, positively correlating with pain scores. In the collagen-induced rheumatoid arthritis (CIA) model, mice demonstrate neutrophil accumulation, N1 polarization (indicated by the ratio of CD45+Ly-6G+CD95+ subset), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in affected paw tissues. Geranyl hydroquinone (GHQ), a natural meroterpenoid with antioxidative properties, reverses N1 polarization and ROS production in synovial neutrophils from RA patients in vitro. Moreover, a 10-day oral administration of GHQ alleviates pain hypersensitivity and reduces neutrophil accumulation, N1 polarization, and ROS production in CIA mice. Notably, GHQ treatment reverses TNF-α-evoked ROS production in neutrophils in vitro through downregulating gene expression associated with the ROS pathway. Further, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and biochemical analyses indicate that GHQ binds to microsomal glutathione S-transferase 3 (MGST3) in neutrophils. In vitro and in vivo evidence demonstrates that the RA-specific analgesic and antioxidative effects of GHQ require MGST3. Lastly, GHQ administration exhibits superior therapeutic effects compared to methotrexate, a first-line disease-modifying antirheumatic drug, in CIA mice. Collectively, our findings indicate that neutrophil accumulation, N1 polarization and ROS production contribute to RA-associated pain, suggesting that targeting these pathways, such as with GHQ, could be a viable strategy for RA treatment.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Melasma is a common hypermelanosis presenting as dark patches on sun-exposed skin. Its treatment remains challenging due to slow response, especially in chronic cases. This study compares the efficacy of 5% cysteamine with ectoine cream versus 4% hydroquinone with ectoine cream in treating melasma. METHODS: A double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted from January to March 2024 across three centers in Indonesia: Dr. Moewardi Hospital (Surakarta), Gatot Soebroto Army Hospital (Jakarta), and Dr. Saiful Anwar Hospital (Malang). Participants were randomly assigned to Group A (5% cysteamine + ectoine) or Group B (4% hydroquinone + ectoine). Efficacy was evaluated using the modified Melasma Area and Severity Index (mMASI) and the JANUS-I skin analyzer. Quality of life was assessed using Melasma Quality of Life Scale (MELASQoL) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaires. RESULTS: Both groups demonstrated reduced mMASI and JANUS-I scores, with slightly greater improvement in Group A, although the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Quality of living also improved in both groups, with no significant difference between them (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Both treatment regimens effectively improved melasma pigmentation and QoL. Either 5% cysteamine with ectoine or 4% hydroquinone with ectoine can be considered viable treatment options for melasma.",

      "abstract": "A series of multi-functional tyrosinase inhibitors derived from kojic acid (KA) and hydroquinone-like diphenols were designed and synthesized using click chemistry. The in vitro enzymatic assay revealed that all compounds containing a free enolic structure showed excellent activity against tyrosinase (IC50 = 0.14-3.7 µM), being significantly more potent than KA. The most active compounds were catechol (6c) and α-naphthol (6i) analogs with 138- and 96-fold higher potency than KA. On the other hand, all free phenolic compounds (6a-c and 6g-j) derived from aromatic diols showed outstanding free radical scavenging activities superior to KA. Certainly, the α-naphthol derivative 6i with IC50 = 10.1 µM was the most active anti-oxidant, being as potent as quercetin. The SAR analysis indicated that the enolic head of the conjugate molecules mainly contributes to the anti-tyrosinase activity, and the free phenolic part of the molecules can offer anti-oxidant potency. The anti-melanogenic assay of the most promising derivative, 6i, against melanoma (B16F10) cells demonstrated that the prototype compound 6i can significantly reduce the melanin content, more effectively than KA. By using a conjugation strategy, we have improved the tyrosinase inhibitory and radical scavenging activity in the multi-functional agents such as 6i over the parent compound KA, being potentially useful in the treatment of hyperpigmentation and other skin disorders.",

      "abstract": "Catechol and hydroquinone are widely present hydroxybenzene isomers in the natural environment that induce environmental toxicities. These hydroxybenzene compounds can be effectively removed by manganese (Mn)-oxides via sorption and oxidative degradation processes. In the present study, we investigated the structure-reactivity relationships in the sorption and oxidation of catechol and hydroquinone on Mn-oxide surfaces. Two widely present Mn-oxides, including hydrous Mn oxide (HMO) and cryptomelane, comprised of layer and tunnel structures, respectively, are specifically studied. Effects of Mn-oxide structures and environmental pH conditions on the removal efficiency of these hydroxybenzene compounds, via sorption and oxidative degradation, are investigated. Cryptomelane, which has a higher specific surface area than HMO, possesses a higher sorption and oxidation capacity. The complexation mechanisms of catechol and hydroquinone vary due to their structure-induced difference in reactivity. Catechol reduced and dissolved more Mn from Mn-oxides than hydroquinone, accompanied by a higher C loss of catechol-C, suggesting a higher reactivity of catechol. Structural changes occurred in the Mn-oxides resulting from reaction with catechol and hydroquinone: reduction of Mn(IV), corresponding formation of Mn(III) and Mn(II) in the mineral, and free Mn2+ ions released into the suspension. These insights could help us better understand and predict the fate of hydroxybenzene compounds in Mn-oxide-rich soils and wastewater treatment systems that generate Mn-oxides via Mn removal and the associated environmental toxicity.",

      "abstract": "In this study, we report the development of a novel electrochemical sensor capable of the simultaneous detection of catechol (CC) and hydroquinone (HQ) through differential pulse voltammetry. The sensor is constructed using carbon fiber (CF) that has been intricately modified with bimetallic PtAu nanoparticles. The fabrication process involves subjecting CF to ultrasound treatment in an acidic mixture, resulting in the formation of activated carbon fiber (ACF). This activation step not only enhances surface roughness but also facilitates subsequent modification, ensuring the stability of the material. Bimetallic PtAu nanoparticles are then uniformly deposited onto the ACF surface through co-deposition from a metal precursor solution. The modified ACF, adorned with bimetallic PtAu nanoparticles, exhibits excellent conductivity and efficiently catalyzes both CC and HQ in a 10 mM phosphate-buffered saline solution at pH 7.0, thereby enabling their simultaneous detection. Under optimized experimental conditions, this electrochemical sensor achieves impressive detection limits of 0.019 μM for CC and 0.28 μM for HQ within the same concentration range of 0.5-50 μM, respectively. The practicality of the sensor is further demonstrated through recovery experiments using real water samples. This electrochemical sensor, with its superior performance and versatility, shows great potential for applications in analytical chemistry and environmental monitoring."

Developing clinical strategies to mitigate those health complications represent a difficult challenge. Our group has previously shown that combining metformin (MTF) and tert-butyl hydroquinone (tBHQ) treatments, in addition to exercise, partially prevents liver damage associated with obesity. Hence, we evaluated the role of exercise in combination with MTF and tBHQ (triple-treatment) to counteract mitochondrial damage in the liver from obese middle-aged female rats. Animals were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) starting at 21 days till 15 months of age. The treated groups performed a Fartlek-type exercise 5 days/week for 30 min/session. MTF and tBHQ were administered at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day, and 10 mg/kg/day, respectively, for 7 days/month from 10 to 15 months of age. Triple-treatment therapeutic approach promoted animal survival, and increased AMPK and PGC1α expression. Treatments increased mitochondrial ATP synthesis and OXPHOS complexes activities, recovered membrane potential, and decreased ROS production. In summary, exercise in combination with intermittent tBHQ and MTF treatments proved to be an excellent intervention to prevent mitochondrial damage caused by HFD."

Currently, there is no controlled trial on the combination of 10% nicotinamide, 5% magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, and 5% hyaluronic acid, a dermo-cosmetic compound, in comparison to 4% hydroquinone for the treatment of melasma. This study aimed to explore the tolerability and efficacy of the association of the combined product versus hydroquinone. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind trial involving women with facial melasma was conducted. Participants were instructed to apply the combined product (NIC group) twice daily or 4% hydroquinone for 60 days (HQ group) at night and placebo in the morning. Evaluations were performed at inclusion, after 14 and 60 days of treatment, measuring the modified Melasma Area and Severity Index (mMASI), Melasma Quality of Life Scale (MELASQoL), and colorimetric luminosity. The Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) was assessed by a blinded evaluator. RESULTS: Both interventions led to a progressive improvement in mMASI, MELASQoL, and GAIS, without a difference between them on D14 and D60 (p>0.2). For NIC, the mean reduction (95% CI) in mMASI was 16% (8-24%) on D14 and 32% (23-41%) on D60, while for HQ, it was 10% (7-24%) on D14 and 43% (34-52%) on D60. Reduction in colorimetric luminosity was greater in the HQ group at D60 (p=0.01). No serious side effects were identified. Of the initially included 50 patients, one was lost to follow-up in the HQ group on D60, and one withdrew consent from the NIC group, both unrelated to treatment. CONCLUSION: The association of 10% nicotinamide, 5% magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, and 5% hyaluronic acid was safe and well-tolerated, although its overall clinical efficacy was numerically inferior to 4% hydroquinone. This regimen can be considered for patients with poor tolerability to hydroquinone. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: #RBR-4mkfmr8."

Confocal laser scanning microscope was employed to confirm the ingestion of HUC-MSC-exo by 16HBE. Cell proliferation, migration, oxidative stress, DNA and chromosome damages of 16HBE were analyzed under HQ stress, and the role of miR-221/PTEN axis was investigated. Our data showed that under HQ stress, different groups of cells exhibited significantly decreased proliferation and migration abilities, and significant oxidative stress, DNA and chromosome damage effects. HUC-MSC-exo could alleviate the cytotoxic, oxidative stress and genotoxic damage effects of HQ on 16HBE cells. Mechanistically, HQ exposure up-regulated the level of miR-221 and down-regulated PTEN, while HUC-MSC-exo could significantly reduce the level of miR-221 and promote PTEN expression, which was involved in alleviating the toxic effects of HQ on 16HBE cells. Our data indicates that HUC-MSC-exo can alleviate the oxidative stress, cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of HQ on 16HBE cells via miR-221/PTEN pathway, and it may be a promising agent for protecting against the toxicity of HQ.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Embryo implantation is a tightly regulated process, critical for a successful pregnancy. After attachment of the blastocyst to the surface epithelium of the endometrium trophoblast migrate from the trophectoderm and invade into the stromal component of endometrium. Alterations on either process will lead to implantation failure or miscarriage. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as benzene induce pregnancy complications, including preterm birth and miscarriages. The mechanism of this effect is unknown. The objective of this study was to elucidate the impact of benzene metabolite, Hydroquinone, on trophoblast function. We tested the hypothesis that Hydroquinone activates the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway modulating trophoblast migration and invasion. METHODS: First-trimester trophoblast cells (Sw.71) were treated with hydroquinone (6 and 25 μM). Trophoblast migration and invasion was evaluated using a 3D invasion/migration model. Gene expression was quantified by q-PCR and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Hydroquinone impairs trophoblast migration and invasion. This loss is associated with the activation of the AhR pathway which reduced the expression of Twist1and IFITM1. IFITM1 overexpression can rescue impaired trophoblast migration. DISCUSSION: Our study highlights that hydroquinone treatment induces the activation of the AhR pathway in trophoblast cells, which impairs trophoblast invasion and migration. We postulate that activation of the AhR pathway in trophoblast suppress Twist1 and a subsequent IFITM1. Thus, the AhR-Twist1-IFITM1 axis represent a critical pathway involved in the regulation of trophoblast migration and it is sensitive to benzene exposure. These findings provide crucial insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying pregnancy complications induced by air pollution.",

      "abstract": "Arbutin and 6'-O-caffeoylarbutin (CA) from Vaccinium dunalianum Wight are known for their ability to inhibit melanin synthesis. To boost the production of arbutin and CA, precursor feeding with hydroquinone (HQ) was studied in V. dunalianum suspension cells. The effect of HQ on the biosynthesis of arbutin and CA in the suspension cells was investigated using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and possible molecular mechanisms were analyzed using metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses. HPLC analysis only showed that the addition of HQ significantly enhanced arbutin synthesis in cells, peaking at 15.52 ± 0.28 mg·g-1 after 0.5 mmol·L-1 HQ treatment for 12 h. Subsequently, metabolomics identified 78 differential expression metabolites (DEMs), of which arbutin and CA were significantly up-regulated metabolites. Moreover, transcriptomics found a total of 10,628 differential expression genes (DEGs). The integrated transcriptomics and metabolomics revealed that HQ significantly enhanced the expression of two arbutin synthase (AS) genes (Unigene0063512 and Unigene0063513), boosting arbutin synthesis. Additionally, it is speculated that CA was generated from arbutin and 3,4,5-tricaffeoylquinic acid catalyzed by caffeoyl transferase, with Unigene0044545, Unigene0043539, and Unigene0017356 as potentially associated genes with CA synthesis. These findings indicate that the precursor feeding strategy offers a promising approach for the mass production of arbutin and CA in V. dunalianum suspension cells and provides new insights for CA biosynthesis in V. dunalianum.",

AIM AND OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aim to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) and topical 4% hydroquinone (HQ) in comparison with monotherapy using topical 4% HQ alone in the treatment of dermal type of melasma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a single-blinded, randomized, split-face clinical trial on twenty female patients with dermal type of melasma. Patients were asked to apply topical 4% HQ on both sides of their face at night for 6 months. In each participant, one side of the face was randomly chosen to receive monthly intradermal injections of PRGF for 3 sessions. Efficacy of the treatment was assessed using hemi melasma area and severity index (MASI) score, physician's global assessment (PGA), and patients' global assessment (PtGA). RESULTS: Both groups revealed significant improvement in hemi-MASI score during the treatment course. Mean percentage of improvement at the end of study was 40.38 ± 6.04% and 33.42 ± 3.23% in the combination therapy and monotherapy groups, respectively (P = 0.31). PGA demonstrated excellent-to-marked improvement in melasma in 25% and 5% of patients in the combination therapy and monotherapy groups, respectively (P = 0.31). PtGA showed high levels of satisfaction in 15% of patients in the combination therapy group (vs. 0% in the monotherapy group) (P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: Differences between the two treatment groups in terms of hemi-MASI and PGA scores were not statistically significant; however, patients demonstrated higher satisfaction with combination of PRGF and topical 4% HQ compared with topical HQ alone. Thereby, combination of PRGF and topical 4% HQ can be suggested as a safe alternative therapeutic approach and may hold promise in the development of future therapeutic options for dermal type of melasma."

      "abstract": "Hydroquinone (HQ) in wastewater is of great concern, as it is harmful to human health and threatens the ecological environment. However, the existing adsorbents have low adsorption capacity for HQ. To improve the removal of HQ, N,S-codoped activated carbon-ZIF-67 (NSAC-ZIF-67@C) was synthesized in this study by in situ growth of ZIF-67 on N,S-codoped activated carbon (NSAC) and carbonization. The influence of pH, contact time, and initial concentration on the adsorption behaviors of NSAC-ZIF-67@C on HQ were investigated. Owing to the synergistic effect of abundant active sites and well-developed pore structure, the NSAC-ZIF-67@C achieved a prominent adsorption capacity of 962 mg·g-1 and can still retain high adsorption performance after 5 cycles for HQ, which is superior to that of reported other adsorbents. HQ adsorption follows the pseudo-second-order kinetics model (R2 = 0.99999) and the Freundlich isotherm model. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis before and after adsorption as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculation results showed that pyridinic-N-termini were conducive to the π-π interactions and hydrogen-bonding interactions. Therefore, the adsorption mechanisms of NSAC-ZIF-67@C on HQ involve pore filling, electrostatic attraction, π-π interaction, and hydrogen bonding. This study is expected to provide a reference for designing highly effective adsorbents for wastewater treatment."

This study assesses the effectiveness of topical tranexamic acid (TA) as an alternative for melasma treatment. METHODS: In a double-blind, split-face, randomized controlled trial involving 20 subjects, the effectiveness of 3% TA versus 4% HQ cream was evaluated over 8 weeks. The modified melasma area and severity index (mMASI), melanin index, erythema index, and side effects were assessed. Subjective improvement was measured using the patient global assessment (PtGA). RESULTS: A significant decline in the mMASI score was observed at weeks 4 and 8 in both groups compared to baseline. There were no statistically significant differences in PtGA scores between the 3% TA group and the 4% HQ group. CONCLUSIONS: Topical 3% TA is as effective and safe as 4% HQ for treating melasma in the Indonesian population, with potential advantages in terms of side-effect profiles.",

Topical treatment with hydroquinone is the standard treatment, but may be associated with complications. Cysteamine is a relatively safe depigmenting agent with an observed depigmenting effect. We designed this study to assess the efficacy of a cysteamine 5% cream in treating acne-induced PIH. METHODS: Twenty-eight out of 32 participants finalized this investigator-blind, randomized, and controlled trial (registered in Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials [IRCTID: IRCT20140212016557N5]). We randomized the patients to apply either cysteamine 5% or hydroquinone 4%/ascorbic acid 3% (HC) cream. Postacne hyperpigmentation index (PAHPI) and melanin index were the assessment measures after four months of treatment. We evaluated the quality of life by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaire. RESULTS: Both cysteamine and HC cream significantly decreased the PAHPI score and melanin index of acne-induced PIH patients (p<0.05). The decrease in PAHPI score and melanin index were not significantly different in treatment groups after four months (p>0.05). Quality of life ameliorated significantly only with cysteamine treatment. However, no significant change in quality of life was observed between groups. LIMITATIONS: Limitations of our study include the relatively small sample size and absence of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Cysteamine cream is an effective treatment of post-acne PIH, with similar efficacy to the accepted treatment of PIH, i.e., hydroquinone cream."

      "abstract": "Leukemia caused by environmental chemical pollutants has attracted great attention, the malignant leukemic transformation model of TK6 cells induced by hydroquinone (HQ) has been previously found in our team. However, the type of leukemia corresponding to this malignant transformed cell line model needs further study and interpretation. Furthermore, the molecular mechanism of malignant proliferation of leukemic cells induced by HQ remains unclear. This study is the first to reveal the expression of aberrant genes in leukemic cells of HQ-induced malignant transformation, which may correspond to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The expression of Linc01588, a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), was significantly up-regulated in CLL patients and leukemic cell line model which previously described. After gain-of-function assays and loss-of-function assays, feeble cell viability, severe apoptotic phenotype and the increased secretion of TNF-α were easily observed in malignant leukemic TK6 cells with Linc01588 deletion after HQ intervention. The tumors derived from malignant TK6 cells with Linc01588 deletion inoculated subcutaneously in nude mice were smaller than controls. In CLL and its cell line model, the expression of Linc01588 and miR-9-5p, miR-9-5p and SIRT1 were negative correlation respectively in CLL and cell line model, while the expression of Linc01588 and SIRT1 were positive correlation. The dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that Linc01588 & miR-9-5p, miR-9-5p & SIRT1 could bind directly, respectively. Furthermore, knockdown of miR-9-5p successfully rescued the severe apoptotic phenotype and the increased secretion of TNF-α caused by the Linc01588 deletion, the deletion of Linc01588 in human CLL cell line MEC-2 could also inhibit malignant biological characteristics, and the phenotype caused by the deletion of Linc01588 could also be rescued after overexpression of SIRT1. Moreover, the regulation of SIRT1 expression in HQ19 cells by Linc01588 and miR-9-5 P may be related to the Akt/NF-κB pathway. In brief, Linc01588 deletion inhibits the malignant biological characteristics of HQ-induced leukemic cells via miR-9-5p/SIRT1, and it is a novel and hopeful clue for the clinical targeted therapy of CLL.",

In this study, first results were obtained with ortho-carbonyl hydroquinones as antiplatelet agents; we found that linking triphenylphosphonium cation to a bicyclic ortho-carbonyl hydroquinone moiety by a short alkyl chain significantly improved their antiplatelet effect by affecting the mitochondrial functioning. The mechanism of action involves uncoupling OXPHOS, which leads to an increase in mitochondrial ROS production and a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential and OCR. This alteration disrupts the energy production by mitochondrial function necessary for the platelet activation process. These effects are responsive to the complete structure of the compounds and not to isolated parts of the compounds tested.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Melasma is an acquired hypermelanosis and occurs in areas exposed to sunlight. AIM: To investigate the effectiveness of Danggui Shaoyao powder (DSP) as a complementary drug in the treatment of melasma. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 40 melasma patients over the age of 18 who met the inclusion criteria entered the study randomly in two DSP + Hydroquinone (DSP + H) and Hydroquinone (H) groups. RESULTS: At the beginning of the study, the average MASI score of the two groups of patients had no statistical difference (DSP + H: 15.79 ±1.01 vs. H: 15.37 ±1.17, p = 0.23). But from the eighth week of treatment, the MASI score of the patients decreased significantly and in the DSP + H group it decreased statistically significantly compared to the H group (DSP + H: 5.83 ±0.97 vs. H: 8.29 ±2.23, p < 0.001 for the eighth week and DSP + H: 3.60 ±0.58 vs. H: 5.52 ±1.73, p < 0.001 for the twelfth week of the treatment). It means after 12 weeks of treatment, the average MASI score of patients in the DSP + H group decreased by 77.26 ±2.70%, but in the grroup H, it decreased by 64.31 ±9.68% (p < 0.001). Dynamic PGA showed that excellent treatment occurred in 65% of the + H group H, but only 20% of the H group (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Oral DSP for 12 weeks along with hydroquinone cream can significantly reduce the MASI score of melasma patients and increase the patients' recovery and satisfaction."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clobetasol has demonstrated remarkable results in treating melasma within a short time frame; however, its use is limited because of the risk of local side effects. To date, there is no controlled trial on sequential clobetasol/hydroquinone for melasma. This study aimed to investigate the tolerability and efficacy of 0.05% clobetasol followed by 4% hydroquinone (CLOB-HQ) in comparison to the isolated use of 4% hydroquinone (HQ). METHODS: A double-blinded, randomized clinical trial involving 50 women with facial melasma was performed. They were directed to apply 0.05% clobetasol every night for 14 days, followed by 4% hydroquinone for 46 days (CLOB-HQ group), or the use of hydroquinone for 60 days (HQ group). Evaluations were carried out at inclusion, and after 14 and 60 days of treatment, measuring modified Melasma Area and Severity Index (mMASI), Melasma Quality of Life scale (MELASQoL), and colorimetry. The Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) was assessed by a blinded evaluator. RESULTS: There was no difference in the main outcomes at D14 and D60 (P > 0.1). For CLOB-HQ, the mean (CI 95%) reduction in mMASI was 13.2% (5.1-21.3%) and 43.1% (32.2-54.0%) at D14 and D60, and for HQ, they were 10.6% (5.9-27.5%) and 44.8% (33.2-52.3%). The MELASQoL, colorimetric luminosity, and GAIS showed a progressive improvement for both groups despite no difference between them. No severe side effects were identified. No cases of telangiectasias, atrophy, or perioral dermatitis were associated with the use of CLOB. CONCLUSION: The sequential CLOB-HQ regimen was safe and well tolerated, even though its efficacy was not different from HQ after 14 or 60 days of treatment. Based on these findings, the use of clobetasol 14 days before hydroquinone is not advisable for the treatment of melasma.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Benzene and its metabolite hydroquinone (HQ) are widely used in daily life, and long-term exposure to benzene or HQ can induce acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are mostly produced by reverse splicing of gene exon mRNA precursors. The modulation of circRNA expression is connected to leukemia progression; however, the molecular mechanism is still unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, the cells were divided into four groups: PBS control group (PBS-TK6), TK6 malignantly transformed cells induced by 10.0 μmol/L HQ (HQ-TK6), and HQ-TK6 cells treated with 5 μmol/L 5-AzaC (DNA methyltransferase inhibitor) for 24 h (HQ + 5-AzaC). HQ-TK6 cells were treated with 200 nmol/L TSA (histone deacetylation inhibitor) for 24 h (HQ + TSA). qRT-PCR was used to identify the differential hsa_circ_401351 expression between the four groups. We further determined the hsa_circ_401351 promoter methylation level with methylation-specific PCR. DNMT1 and DNMT3b were knocked down by CRISPR/Cas9 to elucidate the specific molecular mechanism of hsa_circ_401351 in HQ-TK6 cells. CCK-8 and flow cytometry detected cell proliferation and apoptosis, respectively, after hsa_circ_401351 was overexpressed in HQ-TK6 cells. RESULTS: Compared with the PBS-TK6 group, the expression of hsa_circ_401351 was found to be lower in the HQ-TK6 group. Nevertheless, treatment with 5-AzaC or TSA increased hsa_circ_401351 expression, with the upregulation being more pronounced in the TSA group. The expression of hsa_circ_401351 in the DNMT1 knockdown group was dramatically increased by 50% compared to that in the control group, and the DNA methylation level of the hsa_circ_401351 promoter region was decreased. When hsa_circ_401351 was overexpressed, HQ-TK6 cell proliferation was significantly slowed after 48 h compared with the control group. Flow cytometry showed that cells were mainly arrested in G1 phase, and apoptosis was significantly enhanced. Similarly, qRT-PCR and Western blot data showed significant reductions in Caspase-3 mRNA and protein production, and Bcl-2 mRNA levels were also elevated. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our research showed that elevated DNMT1 expression in HQ-TK6 cells increased methylation levels and decreased expression of the hsa_circ_401351 promoter region, limiting its ability to suppress HQ-TK6 cell growth and enhance apoptosis.",

      "abstract": "Topical hydroquinone (HQ) has been used for decades to treat disorders of hyperpigmentation such as melasma, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and solar lentigines. Additionally, it has been used as a skin-lightening agent for cosmetic purposes. Multiple studies have shown it to be effective in treating hyperpigmentation, though it is not without side effects. Currently, HQ is not approved for over-the-counter use in the United States. Its use is also banned in other countries, including Japan, Australia, and the European Union. Hyperpigmentation disorders affect individuals worldwide. Patients with these disorders are frequently seen in medical practices. Hyperpigmentation disorders can significantly negatively impact a person's quality of life, and agents that treat hyperpigmentation can improve patient outcomes. A comprehensive literature search was performed on HQ as a treatment for skin hyperpigmentation disorders. A literature review revealed that HQ is an effective compound for treating hyperpigmentation disorders and can be combined with other therapies for enhanced results. Evidence exists to support HQ as a topical therapy for skin hyperpigmentation. HQ is not without side effects and should be prescribed by trained professionals who can educate patients on usage. HQ can be used in pharmaceutical regimens to treat hyperpigmentation disorders."

A total of 108 patients with complex facial pigmentation between October 2019 and October 2021 were included in this retrospective study and divided into 2 groups according to the treatment that they received, with 54 cases in each group. The control group received treatment with tranexamic acid and hydroquinone cream. On the basis of the control group, the observation group was treated with photo rejuvenation combined with tranexamic acid and hydroquinone cream. The effectiveness of the treatments in both groups was determined through photographs and melasma area severity index score. The skin conditions were also compared before and after treatment. The effective rate of the observation group was significantly higher than that of the control group (98.15% vs 83.33%, P = .025). The melasma area and severity index score in the observation group was significantly lower than that in the control group after treatment (1.58 ± 0.14 vs 2.96 ± 0.13, P < .001). Before treatment, there was no significant difference in the skin elasticity and skin water content between the observation group and control group (P > .05). After treatment, the skin elasticity and skin water content were significantly higher than that in the control group (P < .05). Photo rejuvenation combined with tranexamic acid and hydroquinone cream has a significant curative effect on patients with complex facial pigmentation, which can significantly improve skin elasticity, increase skin water content, and reduce the degree of skin lesions.",

Therefore, antiplatelet therapy is essential to reduce thrombus formation. However, the utility of current antiplatelet drugs is limited. Therefore, identifying novel antiplatelet compounds is very important in developing new drugs. In this context, the involvement of mitochondrial function as an efficient energy source required for platelet activation is currently accepted; however, its contribution as an antiplatelet target still has little been exploited. Regarding this, the intramolecular hydrogen bonding of hydroquinone derivatives has been described as a structural motif that allows the reach of small molecules at mitochondria, which can exert antiplatelet activity, among others. In this review, we describe the role of mitochondrial function in platelet activation and how hydroquinone derivatives exert antiplatelet activity through mitochondrial regulation.",

      "abstract": "Hydroquinone, a potent toxic agent of cigarette smoke, damages retinal pigmented epithelial cells by triggering oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, two events causally related to the development and progression of retinal diseases. The inner mitochondrial membrane is enriched in cardiolipin, a phospholipid susceptible of oxidative modifications which determine cell-fate decision. Using ARPE-19 cell line as a model of retinal pigmented epithelium, we analyzed the potential involvement of cardiolipin in hydroquinone toxicity. Hydroquinone exposure caused an early concentration-dependent increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, and rise in the rate of oxygen consumption not accompanied by changes in ATP levels. Despite mitochondrial impairment, cell viability was preserved. Hydroquinone induced cardiolipin translocation to the outer mitochondrial membrane, and an increase in the colocalization of the autophagosome adapter protein LC3 with mitochondria, indicating the induction of protective mitophagy. A prolonged hydroquinone treatment induced pyroptotic cell death by cardiolipin-mediated caspase-1 and gasdermin-D activation. Cardiolipin-specific antioxidants counteracted hydroquinone effects pointing out that cardiolipin can act as a mitochondrial \"eat-me signal\" or as a pyroptotic cell death trigger. Our results indicate that cardiolipin may act as a timer for the mitophagy to pyroptosis switch and propose cardiolipin-targeting compounds as promising approaches for the treatment of oxidative stress-related retinal diseases.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of azelaic acid versus hydroquinone in treating melasma patients. We conducted a comprehensive search across four online databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library) from the time of their creation until May 28, 2023. We considered randomized controlled studies comparing hydroquinone with azelaic acid for the treatment of melasma patients. We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2 to evaluate the risk of bias. The mean difference (MD) for continuous variables and the risk ratio (RR) for categorical variables, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were pooled. Six studies were included, with a total of 673 patients with melasma. The azelaic acid had a lower mean change in melasma area severity index (MASI) than the hydroquinone group [MD= -1.23, 95% CI (-2.05, -0.40), P=0.004]. No difference was observed regarding the improvement via the objective response scale, the reduction in pigmentation, or the adverse events reported. However, despite not being statistically significantly different, there was a trend towards having more good responses in the azelaic acid group. Azelaic acid may be better than hydroquinone in reducing melasma severity (measured by MASI). However, larger studies with long-term follow-up are needed to validate these findings."

The present study aims to isolate, purify and evaluate the antihyperglycemic and anti-type 2 diabetic activities of marine hydroquinone from DP. METHODS: Marine hydroquinones were isolated using silica gel, HPLC, and NMR spectroscopy was used to identify compound 1 and compound 2 as zonarol and isozonarol, respectively. The anti-hyperglycemic and anti-type 2 diabetic activities of zonarol were investigated by in vitro assay (α-amylase, α-glucosidase), Lineweaver-Burk plot and Type 2 diabetes mellitus model (T2DM) mice induced by streptozotocin (STZ). RESULT: Zonarol had the highest content and the strongest inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase (IC50 value of 6.03 mg L-1) and α-amylase (IC50 value of 19.29 mg L-1) in a competitive inhibition and mix-type manner, respectively. The maltose and starch loading tests revealed that zonarol significantly reduced postprandial glycemia after 30 min loading (9.12 and 8.12 mg/dL, respectively), compared to normal (11.37 and 12.37 mg/dL, respectively). Zonarol exhibited pancreatic islet cell rejuvenation, as evidenced by increased pancreatic islet mass, and hence helps in the restoration of insulin levels and therefore improves the glucose metabolism in STZ-induced diabetic mice. Zonarol treatment in T2DM elevated abundant levels of main SCFAs (propionate, butyrate, and valeric acid), which are closely related to glucose metabolism homeostasis. CONCLUSION: Our finding indicates that zonarol could be used as a food supplement to treat hyperglycemia and diabetes."

Additionally, a daily treatment of zonarol taken orally has been proven to prevent ulcerative colitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in experimentally induced mice models. In this study, to elucidate the physiological behavior of zonarol in vivo, the establishment of quantitative methods for the determination of zonarol in biological samples and basic pharmacokinetics parameters after oral or intravenous administration with purified zonarol to mice were investigated. The zonarol (20-600 ng/mL) in this study was dose-dependently detected using an HPLC-FI system as a single peak on the ODS column with 80% aqueous methanol at 332 nm with an excitation of 293 nm. The pharmacokinetic parameters were derived from a non-compartment analysis of the plasma concentration of zonarol following oral or intravenous treatment in mice. The absolute bioavailability of zonarol was calculated as 25.0%. Interestingly, the maximal distribution of zonarol in the brain (2.525 ± 1.334 µg/g tissue) at 30 min was observed to be higher and slower than that in the liver and kidney at 15 min after bolus intravenous administrations to the mice (10 mg/kg BW). Based on these results, zonarol might be a candidate for a potential drug, an effective tool for drug delivery, or enhancing the treatment of cerebral disease."

For the effectiveness of the MIP-ZrO2-TiO2 catalyst in degrading HQ, the effects of Zr doping ratio, imprinted molecule dosage, calcination conditions, and pollutant concentration on its photocatalytic activity were investigated. XRD, TEM, XPS, and other techniques were used to evaluate the materials, and the findings revealed that MIP-ZrO2-TiO2 films with imprinted HQ were successfully produced on the ZrO2-TiO2 surface. The optimal preparation conditions were n(Ti):n(Zr) = 100:8, m(HQ) = 1.5 g, 550 °C for the calcination temperature, and 2 h for the calcination duration. The optimum reaction conditions were 10 mg/L HQ concentration, 1 g/L catalyst dose, and a pH of 6.91. According to the findings of photocatalytic tests, during 30 min of UV lamp (365 nm) irradiation, the degradation rates of MIP-ZrO2-TiO2, ZrO2-TiO2, and TiO2 for HQ were 90.58%, 83.94%, and 58.30%, respectively. The findings revealed that the doping of Zr metal and the addition of imprinted molecules improved the photocatalytic activity of TiO2, which can be used for the efficient treatment of low concentrations of hard-to-degrade hydroquinone.",

The ability of titanium dioxide (TiO2) and iron (III) oxide (Fe2O3) to reduce the chronic toxicity of (phenolic) C6H6(OH)2 isomers, namely hydroquinone (HQ) and catechol (CAT) to Ceriodaphnia dubia and Pimephales promelas (less than 24 h-old) were investigated. The toxic endpoints following metal oxide treatment were compared to endpoints of untreated CAT and HQ. In chronic toxicity testing, HQ resulted in greater toxicity than CAT for both test organisms; the median lethal concentrations (LC50) for CAT were 3.66 to 12.36 mg.L-1 for C. dubia and P. promelas, respectively, while LC50 for HQ were 0.07 to 0.05 mg.L-1, respectively. Although both treated solutions presented lower toxic endpoints than those in the untreated solutions, Fe2O3 had a better potential to reduce the toxic effects of CAT and HQ than TiO2.",

      "abstract": "Benzene is a known hematotoxic and leukemogenic chemical. Exposure to benzene cause inhibition of hematopoietic cells. However, the mechanism of how the hematopoietic cells inhibited by benzene undergo malignant proliferation is unknown. The cells carrying leukemia-associated fusion genes are present in healthy individuals and predispose the carriers to the development of leukemia. To identify the effects of benzene on hematopoietic cells, preleukemic bone marrow (PBM) cells derived from transgenic mice carrying the Mll-Af9 fusion gene were treated with benzene metabolite hydroquinone in serial replating of colony-forming unit (CFU) assay. RNA sequencing was further employed to identify the potential key genes that contributed to benzene-initiated self-renewal and proliferation. We found that hydroquinone induced a significant increase in colony formation in PBM cells. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (Ppar-γ) pathway, which plays a critical role in carcinogenesis in multiple tumors, was significantly activated after hydroquinone treatment. Notably, the increased numbers of the CFUs and total PBM cells induced by hydroquinone were significantly reduced by a specific Ppar-γ inhibitor (GW9662). These findings indicated that hydroquinone can enhance self-renewal and proliferation of preleukemic cells by activating the Ppar-γ pathway. Our results provide insight into the missing link between premalignant status and development of benzene-induced leukemia, which can be intervened and prevented.",

      "abstract": "Classical melanoma therapy has several side effects that are responsible for a decrease in the final therapeutic efficacy. It is possible that the drug is degraded before reaching the target site and is metabolized by the body itself, resulting in repeated doses being administered throughout the day and a decrease in patient compliance. Drug delivery systems avoid degradation of the active ingredient, improve release kinetics, prevent the drug from being metabolized before reaching the site of action, and improve the safety and efficacy profiles of adjuvant cancer therapy. The solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) based on hydroquinone esterified with stearic acid realized in this work represent a chemotherapeutic drug delivery system that is useful in the treatment of melanoma. The starting materials were characterized by FT-IR and 1H-NMR, while the SLNs were characterized by dynamic light scattering. In efficacy studies, their ability to influence anchorage-dependent cell proliferation was tested on COLO-38 human melanoma cells. Furthermore, the expression levels of proteins belonging to apoptotic mechanisms were determined by analyzing the role of SLNs in modulating the expression of p53 and p21WAF1/Cip1. Safety tests were conducted to determine not only the pro-sensitizing potential but also the cytotoxicity of SLNs, and studies were conducted to assess the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of these drug delivery."

      "abstract": "Hydroquinone (HQ), one of the main active metabolites of benzene in vivo, 7is commonly used as a surrogate for benzene in in vitro studies and has been shown to be cytotoxic. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in HQ-induced autophagy and apoptosis in human lymphoblastoid cells (TK6) and how activating transcription factor 6 (ATF-6) is involved. We treated TK6 cells with HQ to establish a cytotoxicity model and found that HQ induced cellular ERS, autophagy and apoptosis by Western blot, flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy. In addition, inhibition of both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ERS inhibited cellular autophagy and apoptosis, suggesting that ERS may be induced by ROS, which in turn affects autophagy and apoptosis. Our study also found that HQ could inhibit ATF6 expression and mTOR activation. Knockdown of ATF6 enhanced autophagy and apoptosis levels and further inhibited mTOR activation; activation of ATF6 by AA147 enhanced cellular activity, suggesting that ATF6 may affect cellular autophagy and apoptosis through mTOR. In conclusion, our data suggest that ROS mediated ERS may promote autophagy and apoptosis by inhibiting ATF6-mTOR pathway after HQ treatment of TK6 cells.",

      "abstract": "Treatment of skin diseases is important yet challenging. One of the most common skin diseases in women is melasma, which features acquired facial hyperpigmentation. We studied the effect of cold atmospheric nitrogen plasma on this disease. To characterize the nitrogen plasma, we obtained the relative intensity of the species and the plasma temperature and skin temperature during processing at different input powers and gas flows. Patients complaining of melasma were treated with hydroquinone on both sides of the face, and one side was randomly selected for additional nitrogen plasma therapy. Eight treatment sessions of plasma processing were provided 1 week apart, and one follow-up session was scheduled 1 month after the end of treatment. The rate of improvement was scored by a dermatologist in the eighth session and 1 month following the last session using the modified Melasma Area Severity Index (mMASI). Skin biomechanical characteristics such as melanin, cutaneous resonance running time (CRRT), transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and hydration were measured at baseline and during the fourth, eighth, and follow-up sessions. On both sides, we observed a significant decrease in both CRRT and melanin (P < 0.05). TEWL did not change on both sides, while hydration decreased significantly only on the side to which hydroquinone was applied in isolation (P < 0.05). According to clinical scores, on both sides, we had significant improvement. On the side that plasma was not applied, the percentage reduction of pigmentation (mMASI) in the eighth and follow-up sessions in comparison with the baseline was 5.49 ± 8.50% and 33.04 ± 9.17%, respectively, while on the other side, these figures were 20.57 ± 6.64% and 48.11 ± 11%. For melanin, these figures were 13.84 ± 4.84% and 18.23 ± 7.10% on the hydroquinone side and 21.56 ± 3.13% and 23.93 ± 3.02% on the other side. According to these results, nitrogen plasma can safely complement topical hydroquinone to improve clinical outcomes when treating melasma without causing stratum corneum damage or skin discomfort, though confirmatory studies are needed.",

The localized pH drop at the electrode leads to neutralization of both Alg and cit, leading to EPD of both Alg and cit-Au NPs simultaneously. Post-treatment of the film with Ca2+ solution leads to hybrid Ca-Alg-Au NP hydrogel films. The EPD of Alg in the presence of 4 nm cit-Au NPs occurs at ∼0.8 V (vs Ag/AgCl) as compared to ∼1.0 V in the presence of 15 nm cit-Au NPs and ∼1.4 V in the absence of cit-Au NPs. This is due to the higher catalytic activity of 4 nm cit-Au NPs compared to 15 nm cit-Au NPs for the oxidation of HQ. UV-vis spectra of Ca-Alg-Au NP hydrogel films show absorbance features for both Ca-Alg and Au NPs entrapped within the hydrogel. As the concentration of Au NPs in the EPD solution increases, the Ca-Alg absorbance and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peak of the Au NPs increases, confirming the role of the Au NPs as a catalyst for EPD of Alg. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra of the Ca-Alg-Au NP hydrogel films show characteristic peaks for Ca-Alg and protonated alginic acid groups. The hydrogel thickness is greater with cit-Au NPs compared to without cit-Au NPs at constant EPD potential and time. Forming Ca-Alg and hybrid Ca-Alg-Au NP hydrogel films at low potentials has potential applications in electrochemical and optical sensor development, catalysis, and biological studies."

However, A limited number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding Picos contribute to a modest level of evidence. Topical hydroquinone (HQ) remains to be the first-line therapy. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of non-fractional picosecond Nd:YAG laser (PSNYL), non-fractional picosecond alexandrite laser (PSAL), and 2% HQ cream in the treatment of melasma. METHOD: Sixty melasma patients with Fitzpatrick skin types (FST) III-IV were randomly assigned to the PSNY, PSAL, and HQ groups at a 1:1:1 ratio. Patients in PSNYL and PSAL groups received 3 laser sessions at 4-week intervals. The 2% HQ cream was applied twice daily for 12 weeks in patients of the HQ group. The primary outcome, the melasma area and severity index (MASI) score, was evaluated at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24. The patient assessment score by quartile rating scale was rated at weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24. RESULTS: Fifty-nine (98.3%) subjects were included in the analysis. Each group showed significant change from baseline in MASI scores from week 4 to week 24. The MASI score in the PSNYL group showed the greatest reduction compared to the PSAL group (p = 0.016) and HQ group (p = 0.018). The PSAL group demonstrated comparable MASI improvement as the HQ group (p = 0.998). The PSNYL group had the highest patient assessment score, followed by the PSAL group and then the HQ group, although only the differences between PSNYL and HQ groups at weeks 12 and 16 were significant. Four patients (6.8%) experienced recurrence. Other unanticipated events were transient and subsided after 1 week to 6 months. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of non-fractional PSNYL was superior to that of non-fractional PSAL, which was not inferior to 2% HQ, thus non-fractional Picos providing an alternative for melasma patients with FSTs III-IV. The safety profiles of PSNYL, PSAL, and 2% HQ cream were similar. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: https://www.chictr.org.cn/showprojen.aspx?proj=130994, ChiCTR2100050089."

      "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play a critical role in the damage caused to the body by environmental exogenous chemicals; however, few studies have explored their effects during exposure to benzene and its metabolite, hydroquinone (HQ). An emerging lncRNA, LINC01480, was found to be associated with the immune microenvironment of some cancers, but its specific function remains unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the role of LINC01480 in HQ-induced apoptosis. The biological function of LINC01480 was investigated through gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments. Mechanically, nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation experiment, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), dual-luciferase reporter assay, and rescue experiments were performed. In this study, when TK6 cells were treated with HQ (0, 5, 10, and 20 μM) for 12, 24, 48, and 72 h, the expression of LINC01480 was increased in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, the phosphorylation levels of PI3K and AKT decreased, and apoptosis increased. As compared to the control group, HQ-induced apoptosis was significantly reduced, and the relative survival rate of TK6 cells increased after silencing LINC01480, while overexpression of LINC01480 further sensitized TK6 cells to HQ-induced apoptotic cell death. LINC01480 negatively regulated the PI3K/AKT pathway in TK6 cells, and the apoptosis-inhibiting effect of LINC01480 silencing was reversed after inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway. In addition, ChIP and the dual-luciferase reporter assays showed that the transcription factor Foxo3a promoted LINC01480 transcription by directly binding to the promoter regions - 149 to - 138 of LINC01480. Moreover, short-term HQ exposure promoted the expression of Foxo3a. From these findings, we can conclude that LINC01480 is activated by Foxo3a, and promotes HQ-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway, suggesting that LINC01480 might become a possible target for therapeutic intervention of HQ-induced toxicity.",

This study compares the efficacy of 100mg/mL intradermal TA with 4% topical HQ on female patients presenting with melasma lesions. METHODS: In this randomized double-blind controlled trial, 48 women with melasma were allocated into two groups, treated with either 100mg/mL intradermal TA or topical 4% HQ. The MASI (Melasma Area and Severity Index) score was assessed by paired t-tests and repeated measured ANOVAs. The Dynamic Physician General Assessment (PGA) was also performed by taking photographs with a digital camera. RESULTS: The average MASI score for the HQ and TA groups was 7.7 (3.0 SD) and 5.9 (2.5 SD), respectively. In both groups, the MASI decreased significantly after three months of treatment; however, the decrease was not significant between the two groups (P=0.1). All participants developed mild degrees of burning pain in the injection site without serious adverse effects. LIMITATIONS: First, we only used the MASI score to measure melasma degree. Second, this is a single-center study with a small sample size. Third, the before-after photos were not taken with a high-quality camera. CONCLUSION: The results of our study showed that both TA and continuous HQ significantly reduced the MASI score of patients without any significant differences and serious side effects. Although many treatment modalities are available for melasma, this condition is still challenging for dermatologists with a high recurrence rate after treatment."

Microneedle, a new type of transdermal drug delivery device, can significantly improve skin permeability. In this study, we designed and fabricated a polymer microneedle roller (PMR) using a mold hot pressing method, and established a mouse model of melasma induced by ultraviolet radiation. The dynamometer and insertion test of MNs into parafilm and skin of mice indicates that the MNs have sufficient mechanical properties to insert parafilm and skin of mice. The two methods (apply hydroquinone cream (HQC) directly and pre-treat with PMR before applying HQC) were used to treat melasma. From the results of skin surface observation, determination of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in skin and liver tissues, histological observation, and skin Optical coherence tomography (OCT), we confirmed both the two methods had a therapeutic effect while the PMR pretreatment group exhibited a better therapeutic effect. In addition, there were statistical differences between the UV group (P < 0.05).

      "abstract": "Benzene is a frequent component of environmental pollution and is abundant in petrochemicals, decorative materials, motor vehicle exhaust and cigarette smoke. Benzene is a well-known carcinogen in humans and animals, but the molecular mechanism has not yet been elucidated. Our earlier research indicated that hydroquinone (HQ), one of the main reactive metabolites of benzene, could activate aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which is essential for HQ-induced toxicity, including apoptosis and DNA damage. Since AhR is an important regulator of the immune system that integrates the environmental stimulus and immune response, we examined whether and how HQ-induced AhR activity could lead to NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis in JHP cells. Our results showed that HQ could cause inflammation process and resultant pyroptosis. In JHP cells, HQ also induced endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) by releasing excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS). The activation of pyroptosis induced by HQ treatment was reversed by an antioxidant (NAC) and an ERS inhibitor (4-PBA). Interestingly, the treatment of CH223191, an AhR inhibitor, reversed HQ-induced oxidative stress, ERS and pyroptosis. These data suggested that AhR-mediated HQ-induced ERS, ROS and inflammasome activation may play vital roles in the toxic effects of benzene. This work provides insights and prospective strategies into potential mechanisms for reducing benzene-induced hematotoxicity.",

      "abstract": "Hydroquinone (HQ), a well-known carcinogenic agent, induces oxidative stress, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and malignant transformation. As an antioxidant actor, the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) drives adaptive cellular protection in response to oxidative stress. The human lymphoblastoid cell line (TK6 cells) is widely used as a model for leukemia researches. In the present study, we focused on exploring whether Nrf2 regulatory cell cycle in TK6 cells upon HQ treatment and the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that the cell cycle arrest in TK6 cells induced by hydroquinone was accompanied by activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway. We further clarified that Nrf2 loss accelerated cell cycle progression from G0/G1 to S and G2/M phases and promoted ROS production by downregulating the expression of SOD and GSH. Western blotting analysis indicated that Nrf2 regulated cell cycle progression via p16/pRb signaling pathways. Therefore, we conclude that Nrf2 is engaged in HQ-induced cell cycle arrest as well through p16/pRb and antioxidant enzymes.",

      "abstract": "Dyspigmentation is a common cosmetic concern in dermatology. Currently, the first line topical medication in the United States is hydroquinone. Hydroquinone use is associated with potential safety concerns including cytotoxicity to melanocytes, systemic absorption, metabolism in distant organs, and production of potentially carcinogenic metabolites. Hexylresorcinol is an ingredient that has been used in food preservation and as antiseptic has been shown to inhibit tyrosinase in vitro and has been studied as a novel skin-lightening agent. To perform a double-blind randomized split-body investigation of comparison on topical hexylresorcinol and hydroquinone on face and hands to assess for change in the appearance of skin tone and pigmentation. Thirty-two healthy female participants ages 35-65 (50.93 ± 7.37) years old with skin type I-IV were randomized to using either topical 1% hexylresorcinol or 2% hydroquinone on the left or right side of the face and corresponding hand over 12 weeks. The topical preparation was applied twice a day to assigned areas. Standardized photos were taken of the face and colorimetric measurements were taken of both sides of the forehead, cheeks and each hand at baseline (Day 0), week 4, and week 12. Of the 32 participants, 3 were lost to follow-up and the remaining were included in the final analysis. Pigmentation measured by colorimeter and clinical grading were significantly decreased at 4 and 12 weeks relative to baseline with no difference between the HR and HQ groups. No adverse effects were noted with either intervention. Hexylresorcinol 1% is well-tolerated and equivalent to hydroquinone 2% in reducing the appearance of facial and hand pigment. Further studies with an expanded population and longer time course are warranted.Registration No.: NCT04345094.",

OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of 1.4% silymarin with 2% hydroquinone for melasma treatment in Asians. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, split-face study of 25 patients with epidermal or mixed-type melasma, the facial sides were randomized for the application of silymarin cream on one side and hydroquinone on the contralateral side for 3 months. Results were evaluated using a colorimeter, modified Melasma Area and Severity Index (mMASI) score, and patient self-assessment. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients completed the study. Colorimetric measurements calculated as relative lightness index (RL*I) showed no statistical difference between the 2 treatments (P=0.715). Compared with baseline, both treatments showed statistically significant improvements of RL*I, with 14.56% and 12.82% improvement in silymarin and hydroquinone, respectively. Modified MASI scores decreased after both treatments but were only statistically significant on the hydroquinone side, achieving 17.97% reduction (P=0.02) vs 7.11% (P=0.32) on the silymarin side. There was no statistically significant difference of the RL*I and modified MASI between the 2 treatments (P&gt;0.05). Patients' assessment of hydroquinone treatment showed a 69.6% good-excellent improvement with a visual analog scale (VAS) satisfaction score of 7.82, compared with silymarin showing a 73.9 % good-excellent improvement and VAS score of 7.65 (P=0.50). More adverse effects occurred with the hydroquinone. CONCLUSION: Although hydroquinone showed a better response, topical silymarin was effective in the treatment of epidermal and mixed-type melasma with fewer side effects.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of hydroquinone (HQ) cream alone versus HQ cream combined with 755-nm picosecond (PS) laser in the treatment of melasma. METHOD: Twenty subjects presenting with mixed-type melasma were enrolled in the study. All patients were instructed to apply 2% HQ cream to both sides of the face for 4 weeks. Randomly assigned hemifaces of all patients thereafter received 5 biweekly PS laser treatments. Objective (measurement of average melanin content and melanin index) and subjective (grading of modified melasma area and severity index [mMASI] score and global percentage of pigment clearance) assessments of melasma clearance, and occurrence of adverse effects were evaluated at 1-, 3-, and 6-months after the final laser treatment. RESULTS: mMASI scores were significantly improved from baseline for both sides (p = 0.006 HQ alone, p < 0.001 HQ + PS laser), with no statistically significant difference when comparing HQ alone versus HQ + PS laser. Objective assessments (measurements of average melanin content and melanin index) of melasma clearance corresponded to the clinical evaluation using mMASI score. Mild postinflammatory hyperpigmentation was observed in 15% of the patients on the laser-treated side, while no adverse effects were reported on the HQ monotherapy side.

STUDY DESIGN: This comparative prospective study was conducted at the Dermatology Department, Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi, Pakistan from October 16, 2018 to April 16, 2019. METHODOLOGY: A total of 290 patients with melasma, 18 to 50 years of age, were included in this study. Patients with a history of discoid lupus erythematosus, pregnancy, lactation, anemia, and oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy were excluded from the study. Randomization was 1:1 for groups A and B, i.e., each upcoming patient was included in the next group. This randomization was supervised by another clinician. One hundred forty-five patients were placed in group A (intralesional tranexamic acid), while 145 were enrolled in group B (topical 4% hydroquinone). Follow-up was done at four weekly intervals for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, the final response was assessed. RESULTS: In group A, the average age was 33.74 ± 6.67 years, while in group B it was 32.08 ± 6.08 years. Among the entire patients, the majority of the patients, 207 (71.38%), were in the age range of 18 to 35 years. Intralesional tranexamic acid was efficacious in 64 (44.14%) patients, while 47 (32.41%) of group B (topical 4% hydroquinone) showed complete improvement (p-value = 0.040). CONCLUSION: This study concluded that using intralesional tranexamic acid is more effective in treating melasma than topical 4% hydroquinone."

The high frequency of recurrence renders the management more challenging. Autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP) has promising potential in the treatment of melasma. This study evaluates the efficacy of combination of autologous PRP and Hydroquinone and compares it with the gold standard molecule 4% Hydroquinone. Thirty patients with melasma were enrolled in this split-face study conducted between 2018 and 2020. All the patients were prescribed Hydroquinone cream 4% to be applied on the affected area at night. Microneedling was performed once a month (total four sessions) on both sides of face, followed by application of autologous platelet rich plasma on right side and normal saline as control on left side of affected area. Modified Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI) score, Patient satisfaction score and Physician's Global Assessment score were calculated at baseline and after each session and improvement was assessed. Improvement in mean modified MASI score was significant on both sides of face. Mean percentage improvement in modified MASI score on study side and control side was 82% and 69% respectively. The difference between the two sides was statistically significant in terms of modified MASI, patient satisfaction and physician global assessment scores. Adverse effects were mild and transient. Autologous platelet rich plasma is an effective and safe therapy for treatment of melasma. Combination of autologous PRP and 4% Hydroquinone showed greater improvement than hydroquinone alone.",

      "abstract": "Reprogramming of cellular metabolism is a vital event during tumorigenesis. The role of glycolysis in malignant progression promoted by hydroquinone (HQ), one of the metabolic products of benzene, remains to be understood. Recently, we reported the overexpression of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in HQ-enhanced malignant progression of TK6 cells and hypothesized that SIRT1 might contribute to glycolysis and favor tumorigenesis. Our data showed that acute exposure of TK6 cells to HQ for 48 h inhibited glycolysis, as indicated by reduction in glucose consumption, lactate production, hexokinase activity, and the expression of SIRT1 and glycolytic enzymes, including HIF-1α, hexokinase-2 (HK-2), ENO-1, glucose transporter 1 (Glut-1), and lactic dehydrogenase A (LDHA). Knockdown of SIRT1 or inhibition of glycolysis using the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) downregulated the levels of SIRT1 and glycolytic enzymes and significantly enhanced HQ-induced cell apoptosis, although knockdown of SIRT1 or 2-DG alone had little effect on apoptosis. Furthermore, immunofluorescence and Co-IP assays demonstrated that SIRT1 regulated the expression of HK-2, and HQ treatment caused a decrease in SIRT1 and HK-2 binding to mitochondria. Importantly, we found that glycolysis was promoted with increasing HQ treatment weeks. Long-term HQ exposure increased the expression of SIRT1 and several glycolytic enzymes and promoted malignant cell progression. Moreover, compared with the PBS group, glucose consumption and lactate production increased after 10 weeks of HQ exposure, and the protein levels of SIRT1 and HK-2 were increased after 15 weeks of HQ exposure, while those of Glut-1, ENO-1, and LDHA were elevated. In addition, SIRT1 knockdown HQ 19 cells exhibited decreased lactate production, glucose consumption, glycolytic enzymes expression, cell growth, and tumor formation in nude mice. Our findings identify the high expression of SIRT1 as a strong oncogenic driver that positively regulates HK-2 and promotes glycolysis in HQ-accelerated malignant progression of TK6 cells.",

Although pregnancy-induced melasma is usually temporary, it can become a chronic condition, with significant negative impact on quality of life (QoL). AIMS: Determine the efficacy and tolerability of a topical, non-hydroquinone, non-retinol pigment-correcting serum (LYT2) for the treatment of pregnancy-induced melasma. METHODS: This 12-week, single-center clinical trial enrolled 34 non-pregnant women who developed mild to severe facial melasma following a previous pregnancy (mean age, 42 years). LYT2 was applied twice daily to facial skin for 12 weeks in addition to a basic skincare regimen. Outcomes included changes from baseline in skin physiology parameters, such as brightness (L*), using objective digital image analysis, investigator-rated Overall Hyperpigmentation scale, Global Improvement, and Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI), as well as subject-assessed Melasma Quality of Life Scale. Subjects also completed a questionnaire on self-perceived efficacy and attributes of the study product. Tolerability was assessed by the investigators (erythema, scaling, and edema) and subjects (burning/stinging and itching). Clinical assessments were conducted at baseline and Weeks 4, 8, and 12. RESULTS: LYT2 provided statistically significant reductions in overall hyperpigmentation scores as early as Week 4 (-5.8% change from baseline) and continued through Week 12 (-14.6% change from baseline; all p < 0.001). Significant improvements in MASI scores and QoL were also achieved following LYT2 treatment, which was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: LYT2 represents a new efficacious alternative to hydroquinone-based treatments for pregnancy-induced melasma.",

Cysteamine, a non-melanocytotoxic molecule is a safer alternative to hydroquinone and usable for long-term use. AIM: To evaluate the effect of cysteamine 5% cream in the treatment of melasma. METHODS: Sixty-five of 80 patients completed this single-blind, randomized, controlled trial. The patients received cysteamine 5% or hydroquinone 4%/ascorbic acid 3% (HC) cream. The therapeutic response was evaluated by modified MASI (mMASI) and melanin index (SkinColorCatch) after 2 and 4 months of treatment. The effect of treatment on the quality of life was also assessed. RESULTS: The decrease in mMASI score was from 6.69 ± 2.96 to 4.47 ± 2.16 in the cysteamine group and from 6.26 ± 3.25 to 3.87 ± 2.00 in the HC group after 4 months (p values < 0.001). The melanin index decreased from 37.72 ± 10.17 to 31.47 ± 11.90 in the cysteamine group and from 36.37 ± 10.80 to 23.16 ± 8.83 in the HC group after 4 months (p-value = 0.003 and <0.001, respectively). The difference between mMASI score at baseline and month 4 was not significant between both groups (p-value > 0.05). The difference between the melanin index at baseline and month 4 was significantly more pronounced in the HC group (p-value = 0.002). Quality of life improved in both groups (p-value < 0.05), but was not significantly different between groups (p-value > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Cysteamine was confirmed to be an effective treatment for melasma, with equivalent results to HC in reducing mMASI score and improving quality of life, despite lesser melanin index reduction observed. Cysteamine and HC efficacy was confirmed in patients recalcitrant to previous treatments, by a significant reduction of mMASI and melanin index.",

In this study, we aimed to identify the upstream pathway involved in ROS-mediated TNF-α expression. HQ treatment increased SIDT2 expression, which subsequently decreased miR-25 and SIRT3 expression in U937 cells. Notably, miR-25 downregulation promoted SIDT2 expression in HQ-treated U937 cells. SIDT2 induced lysosomal degradation of SIRT3 mRNA, but inhibited miR-25 expression through a lysosome-independent pathway. MiR-25 inhibition reduced NOX4 mRNA turnover, resulting in increased NOX4 protein levels. NOX4 induces mitochondrial ROS production and HuR downregulation. Restoration of HuR expression increased SIRT3 expression, suggesting that NOX4-mediated HuR downregulation promotes SIDT2-mediated degradation of SIRT3 mRNA. Inhibition of NOX4 or SIRT3 overexpression abolished HQ-induced ROS production, thereby abolishing TNF-α upregulation. Overall, these results indicate that SIDT2 regulates the miR-25/NOX4/HuR axis and SIRT3 mRNA destabilization, leading to ROS-mediated TNF-α upregulation in HQ-treated U937 cells. HQ-induced increase in TNF-α expression in HL-60 cells was also mediated through a similar pathway.",

      "abstract": "Melasma is a common, acquired, circumscribed hypermelanosis of sun-exposed skin. It presents as symmetric, hyperpigmented macules having irregular, serrated, and geographic borders. Compare the efficacy of 35% gycolic acid (GA) peel vs. Jessner peel (JP) as an adjuvant to topical triple combination (2% Hydroquinone, 0.025% tretinoin, 0.01% Fluocinolone acetonide) therapy in Melasma in females. Sixty cases of Melasma attending Skin-VD OPD, Baroda Medical College from September 1, 2016 to July 30,/2017 were enrolled. Among them, 12% cases had history of menstrual irregularity, 5% cases had past history of oral contraceptive (OC) pill intake, and 10% cases had history of working outdoors. Most common pattern of melasma was centrofacial 32 cases (53%) which was followed by malar pattern in 27 cases (47%) and mandibular pattern in one case (2%). Fifty cases who completed study were evaluated for comparative efficacy of GA peel versus JP as an adjuvant to topical triple combination therapy. Average reduction in Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI) score in cases treated with GA peel group was 58.56% with Jessner peel group was 59.12%. In GA peel group, 84% cases had moderate to good improvement, whereas in JP group 92% cases had moderate to good improvement. According to present study, safety and efficacy profile of 35% GA peel vs. JP was almost same. Both can be used as an adjuvant to topical triple combination therapy of 2% hydroquinone, 0.025% tretinoin, and 0.01% fluocinolone acetonide in females suffering from melasma. We recommend that it will be safer for the pregnant women to get the GA peel rather than the treatment containing hydroquinone and tretinoin since the activity/performance is very similar.",

      "abstract": "In the last decades, the conductive polymer PEDOT:PSS has been introduced in Si-based hybrid solar cells, gaining noticeable research interest and being considered a promising candidate for next generation solar cells which can achieve both of low manufacturing cost and high power conversion efficiency. This study succeeded in improving the electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS to 937 S/cm through a simple process of adding hydroquinone (HQ) to the pristine PEDOT:PSS solution. The results also showed that the addition of HQ to PEDOT:PSS(HQ-PEDOT:PSS) could not only dramatically improve the conductivity but also well-sustain the work function characteristics of PEDOT:PSS by promoting the formation of more continuous conductive-PEDOT channels without removing the insulating PSS. In this report, we reveal that the application of the HQ-PEDOT:PSS to the Si/PEDOT:PSS HSC could significantly improve the short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage characteristics to increase the power conversion efficiency of the HSCs compared to the conventional approaches. Moreover, we also treated the Si surface with the organic monomer, benzoquinone (BQ) to (1) passivate the excess Si surface defect states and (2) to improve the properties of the Si/PEDOT:PSS interface. We show that BQ treatment is able to dramatically increase the minority carrier lifetime induced by effective chemical and field-effect passivation in addition to enhancing the wettability of the Si surface with the PEDOT:PSS solution. As a result, the power conversion efficiency was increased by 10.6% by introducing HQ and BQ into the fabrication process of the Si/PEDOT:PSS HSC."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Arctostaphylos uva-ursi (L.) Spreng. (bearberry) is a well-known traditional herbal plant used as a urinary tract disinfectant. Its antiseptic and diuretic properties can be attributed to hydroquinone, obtained by hydrolysis of arbutin. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to determine the toxic profile of free hydroquinone on urinary bladder cells (T24) as a target of therapeutic action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the extract and the digestive stability and bioavailability of arbutin and hydroquinone were performed by HPLC assay and simulated in vitro digestion, respectively. Cytotoxic effect, reactive oxygen species induction and proteome changes in T24 cells after hydroquinone treatment were determined using Neutral red assay, 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay and mass spectrometry, respectively. RESULTS: Through in vitro digestion, arbutin was stable, but hydroquinone increased after pepsin treatment (109.6%) and then decreased after the small intestine phase (65.38%). The recommended doses of Uva-ursi had a cytotoxic effect on T24 cells only when all hydroquinone conjugates were converted to free hydroquinone (320 and 900 μg/mL) and the toxic effect was enhanced by recovery. One cup of the therapeutic dose had a prooxidative effect after 4 h of incubation. Shorter time of cell exposure (2 h) to hydroquinone did not have any impact on reactive oxygen species induction. Proteomic analysis found 17 significantly up-regulated proteins compared to control. Hydroquinone activated proteins related to oxidative stress response, stress-adaptive signalling, heat shock response and initiation of translation. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the therapeutic properties of bearberry, up-regulated T24 cell proteins are evidence that plant compounds, although from a natural source, may exhibit negative properties.",

      "abstract": "Although it has been well recognized that benzene exposure can cause hematopoietic disorders such as aplastic anemia and leukemia, the underlying molecular mechanism remains to be fully understood. Emerging evidence indicated that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) plays important roles in hematopoietic and immune systems. This study investigated the activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) by hydroquinone (HQ) and its role in HQ-induced DNA damage and apoptosis in cultured human lymphocytes (JHP cells). We also investigated the effect of ROS on AhR activation and functions in JHP cells exposed to HQ with and without regulator including N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), a potent antioxidant, and tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), a Nrf2 activator. Results showed that HQ can cause oxidative stress, DNA damage and apoptosis. Pretreatment of an AhR antagonist (CH223191) can significantly increase the cell survival and mitigate HQ-induced toxicities such as DNA damage and apoptosis. We found that HQ can obviously increase expressions of total protein of AhR and prompt nuclear translocation compared to the control group. Interestingly, NAC can block HQ-induced AhR activation and DNA damage and apoptosis. Conclusively, our results indicated that HQ toxicity is mediated by AhR which is in turn regulated by ROS generated by HQ. The interaction between AhR and ROS drive and amplify the hematopoietic toxicity of HQ. This study provided new insights of mechanism and potential targets for the prevention and treatment to benzene-induced hematopoietic toxicity.",

Hydroquinone is a commonly used depigmenting agent in clinical practice for treating hyperpigmentation. Prolonged use of hydroquinone has been associated with cancer risk and exogenous ochronosis. The CARES (The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act) Act of 2020 has instituted significant changes to hydroquinone containing OTC (over the counter) products, and consequently, many hydroquinone-based OTC products had to be withdrawn from the market. Henceforth, products containing hydroquinone would need US Food and Drug Administration approval via new drug application pathways for commercialization. Alternative treatment options to hydroquinone in clinical practice are reviewed in this paper with regard to their safety and efficacy vis a vis hydroquinone. Also, new potential treatment options such as thiamidol, Polypodium leucotomos, and glutathione are discussed. The review shows that these alternative depigmenting agents can be rationally combined to achieve desired treatment goals in the management of hyperpigmentation.",

CSCs are drivers of cancer initiation, progression, therapeutic failure, and disease recurrence. Thereby, novel compounds targeting CSCs offer a promising way to control cancer. In this study, the hydroquinone 5-O-cinnamoyl ester of renieramycin M (CIN-RM) was demonstrated to suppress lung cancer CSCs. CIN-RM was toxic to lung cancer cells with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of around 15 µM. CIN-RM suppressed CSCs by inhibiting colony and tumor spheroid formation. In addition, the CSC population was isolated and treated and the CSCs were dispatched in response to CIN-RM within 24 h. CIN-RM was shown to abolish cellular c-Myc, a central survival and stem cell regulatory protein, with the depletion of CSC markers and stem cell transcription factors ALDH1A1, Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2. For up-stream regulation, we found that CIN-RM significantly inhibited Akt and consequently decreased the pluripotent transcription factors. CIN-RM also inhibited mTOR, while slightly decreasing p-GSK3β (Ser9) but rarely affected the protein kinase C (PKC) signal. Inhibiting Akt/mTOR induced ubiquitination of c-Myc and promoted degradation. The mechanism of how Akt regulates the stability of c-Myc was validated with the Akt inhibitor wortmannin. The computational analysis further confirmed the strong interaction between CIN-RM and the Akt protein with a binding affinity of -10.9 kcal/mol at its critical active site. Taken together, we utilized molecular experiments, the CSC phenotype, and molecular docking methods to reveal the novel suppressing the activity of this compound on CSCs to benefit CSC-targeted therapy for lung cancer treatment."

Tranexamic acid (TA), a derivative of amino acid lysine, has shown promising results over the past few years when used along with other therapies and when used as a stand-alone therapy. AIM OF THE WORK: In this study, we aimed to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of topically applied tranexamic acid after microneedling versus topically applied hydroquinone (HQ) 4% alone in patients with melasma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty selected patients were divided randomly according to the random number allocation method into two groups (25 patients each) of A (topical 4% hydroquinone, nightly application) and B (microneedling + topical 4% TA, every other week). RESULTS: After eight weeks of treatment, the mean modified MASI score of the HQ treated side changed from 6.604 ± 4.02 to 3.032 ± 1.19 with a mean decrease percentage of 54.8% ± 19.4%. This reduction in modified MASI score was found to be statistically significant, (p < 0.001). MASI score of group B (TA +microneedling) changed from 6.348 ± 3.84 to 3.712 ± 1.19 with mean decrease percentage of 57.4% ± 23.4% which was also statistically significant, (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated safety and efficacy of both used modalities and with minimal side effects. Topical HQ application achieved minimal non-significant higher satisfactory results among raters and subjects.",

Our study objectives were to review data on hydroquinone-associated ochronosis to determine risk factors for patients experiencing this adverse event. On September 27, 2020 (MEDLINE/PubMed), and October 30, 2020 (Scopus and Web of Science), databases were searched for \"ochronosis + hydroquinone\" by both authors to reduce risk basis. PRISMA reporting guidelines were used to select 56 articles with a total of 126 patients with hydroquinone-associated ochronosis. Included articles described hydroquinone-associated ochronosis. Articles were excluded if they had irrelevant content, were non-English language text, and were non-case studies. Full text articles were assessed and recorded. Cross-tabulation analysis was performed on categorical data, and Fisher exact test was performed. Ochronosis was most often reported in middle-aged women (53.2%), of African descent (45.2%), Black races (55.5%), and Fitzpatrick skin types V-VI (52.4%). It was most frequently reported with unknown and hydroquinone concentrations greater than 4% (32.5 and 35.7% cases, respectively). Median duration of use was 5 years, with only four cases reported with courses 3 months or shorter and eight cases reported with use 1 year or less. All patients presented with facial blue-black or gray-blue macules in a reticulate, lace-like fashion. Histopathology consistently showed solar elastosis and brownish-yellow, 'banana-shaped' fibers between degenerated collagen fibers of the papillary dermis. Based on these findings, we conclude that hydroquinone in concentrations above 4% and in treatment courses longer than 3 months may be associated with new-onset ochronosis.",

Although various treatments methods have been suggested for treating melasma, none has been completely successful. The aim of the study was to compare the efficiency of erbium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Er:YAG) laser and 4% hydroquinone (HQ) with the effects of intradermal tranexamic acid (TA) and 4% HQ for the treatment of refractory melasma. METHODS: The study included 31 female patients with refractory melasma. The left or right side of the patient's face was chosen randomly to receive laser therapy with topical HQ on the one side (i.e. the laser side) and intradermal injection of TA plus topical HQ on the other side (i.e. the mesotherapy side). Digital photography was performed at baseline, at the end of the treatment, and three months after the treatment as follow-up. Two independent dermatologists evaluated the modified Melasma Area and Severity Index (mMASI) score according to the pictures. Overall, 27 patients completed the study and went through the clinical evaluation. RESULTS: Treatment using HQ in combination with either Er:YAG laser therapy or intradermal injection of TA significantly improved the hemi-mMASI and resulted in higher patient satisfaction. While the improvement was not significantly different between the two regiments after the treatment and upon follow up and both were equally efficient in the treatment of refractory melasma (p = 1.308), recurrence rate was higher after treatment with Er:YAG laser than TA (12% vs 34%). CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the comparable efficacy of TA plus topical HQ versus Er:YAG laser plus topical HQ for the treatment of refractory melasma. Both groups improved significantly and no subject left the treatment because of adverse effects. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: IRCT20191011045057N1.",

Cigarette smoke increases the risk for developing AMD by causing increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and damage in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE).

In the present study, we investigated the propensity of hydroquinone to induce the secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18. The activation of these cytokines is usually regulated by the Nucleotide-binding domain, Leucine-rich repeat, and Pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. ARPE-19 cells were exposed to hydroquinone, and cell viability was monitored using the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide salt (MTT) assays. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were used to measure the levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 as well as NLRP3, caspase-1, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Hydroquinone did not change IL-1β release but significantly increased the secretion of IL-18. Cytoplasmic NLRP3 levels increased after the hydroquinone treatment of IL-1α-primed RPE cells, but IL-18 was equally released from primed and nonprimed cells. Hydroquinone reduced the intracellular levels of PARP, which were restored by treatment with the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC). NAC concurrently reduced the NLRP3 levels but had no effect on IL-18 release. In contrast, the NADPH oxidase inhibitor ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (APDC) reduced the release of IL-18 but had no effect on the NLRP3 levels. Collectively, hydroquinone caused DNA damage seen as reduced intracellular PARP levels and induced NLRP3-independent IL-18 secretion in human RPE cells.",

      "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) development is strongly associated with cigarette smoke exposure, which activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) as a trigger for Th17 inflammatory pathways. We previously demonstrated that the exposure to hydroquinone (HQ), one of the major compounds of cigarette tar, aggravates the arthritis symptomatology in rats. However, the mechanisms related to the HQ-related RA still remain elusive. Cell viability, cytokine secretion, and gene expression were measured in RA human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RAHFLS) treated with HQ and stimulated or not with TNF-α. Antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) was also elicited in wild type (WT), AhR -/- or IL-17R -/- C57BL/6 mice upon daily exposure to nebulized HQ (25ppm) between days 15 to 21. At day 21, mice were challenged with mBSA and inflammatory parameters were assessed. The in vitro HQ treatment up-regulated TNFR1, TNFR2 expression, and increased ROS production. The co-treatment of HQ and TNF-α enhanced the IL-6 and IL-8 secretion. However, the pre-incubation of RAHFLS with an AhR antagonist inhibited the HQ-mediated cell proliferation and gene expression profile. About the in vivo approach, the HQ exposure worsened the AIA symptoms (edema, pain, cytokines secretion and NETs formation) in WT mice. These AIA effects were abolished in HQ-exposed AhR -/- and IL-17R -/- animals though. Our data demonstrated the harmful HQ influence over the onset of arthritis through the activation and proliferation of synoviocytes. The HQ-related RA severity was also associated with the activation of AhR and IL-17 pathways, highlighting how cigarette smoke compounds can contribute to the RA progression."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Melasma is an acquired cutaneous disorder characterized by hyperpigmentation of the face predominantly affecting the areas exposed to direct sun light. The triple combination cream, i.e., a mid-potency corticosteroid (Fluocinolone acetonide 0.01%), a retinoid (Tretinoin 0.05%), and Hydroquinone 4% is one of the widely used topical medicament for melasma treatment world over. Tranexamic acid is another agent found to be effective in melasma treatment when used topically, intra-lesionally or orally. This study has been conducted to compare mean decrease in Melasma Area Severity Index (MASI) score when tranexamic acid is combined with triple combination cream versus triple combination cream alone for melasma treatment. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a tertiary care hospital of Pakistan. Sixty-three patients of melasma who met the inclusion criteria and gave written informed consent for the study were enrolled. These patients were randomly divided into 2 treatment groups. Group A was given triple combination cream and oral tranxemic acid while Group B was given triple combination cream for duration of 8 weeks. Severity of melasma was assessed by MASI, which was calculated at baseline and at the end of week 8. Mean decrease in MASI score was calculated in both groups and statistically analysed employing SPSS 20. RESULTS: Sixty patients, 30 in both groups, completed the study. Study participants were predominantly female (81.67%), with mean age of 30.46±6.24 years in group A while 31.90±4.53 in group B. No statistically significant difference was noted in both treatment groups for mean decrease in the MASI score (6.4933±4.38358 in group A compared to 5.7833±5.04251 in the group B; p-value 0.56). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of oral tranexamic acid did not contribute significantly in decrease in MASI score when used in combination with topical triple regimen. It may have a role as an adjuvant to topical triple combination cream.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Melasma can be refractory to treatment, and relapses are frequent. Thiamidol is a new potent tyrosinase inhibitor that has been found effective as a cosmeceutical for the depigmenting of melasma. OBJECTIVE: This study compared the efficacy and tolerability of topical 0.2% Thiamidol vs. 4% hydroquinone for facial melasma. METHODS: Fifty women with facial melasma participated in a randomized, evaluator-blinded, controlled study from September through November 2020. Patients were randomly assigned to apply a double layer of 0.2% Thiamidol twice a day or 4% hydroquinone cream at bedtime, for 90 days. Both groups received tinted sunscreen (sun protection factor 60, PPD 20). The primary outcome was the change from the baseline Modified Melasma Area Seve:rity Index (mMASI) score. Secondary outcomes were improvements in the patients' quality of life [Melasma Quality of Life Index (MELASQoL)], colourimetry, and Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) evaluation. RESULTS: One participant, from the hydroquinone group, did not complete the study (unrelated to adverse effects). The mean (SD) age of the participants was 43 (6) years, and 86% were phototypes III-IV. Both groups exhibited a reduction in mMASI, MELASQoL, and colour contrast scores (P < 0.01). The mean [95% confidence interval (CI 95%)] reductions of the mMASI scores were 43% (35-50%) for Thiamidol and 33% (23-42%) for hydroquinone. There was no difference between the groups in the reductions in mMASI, MELASQoL, colourimetric contrast and GAIS scores (P ≥ 0.09). The GAIS analysis resulted in an improvement of 84% (CI: 95% 67-97%) for participants in the Thiamidol group and 74% (CI: 95% 61-93%) for those in the hydroquinone group. There were only mild adverse effects in the Thiamidol group, but allergic contact dermatitis was evidenced in two (8%) participants. CONCLUSION: The melasma improvement achieved using 0.2% Thiamidol did not differ from that of 4% hydroquinone cream. Thiamidol can be considered a suitable option for melasma patients with poor tolerability or treatment failure with hydroquinone.",

Combining TA with either hydroquinone 4% or Q-switched Nd:YAG laser may be associated with greater improvement of melasma. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral TA alone and combined with either topical hydroquinone 4% or low-fluence 1064 nm Q-switched Nd:YAG laser in treatment of mixed melasma. PATIENTS & METHODS: Patients were randomly divided into three groups of 20 patients each. Group A were treated with oral TA 250 mg twice daily for three months; group B were treated with TA similarly combined with topical hydroquinone 4% cream; group C were treated with TA combined with two sessions of 1064 nm low-fluence Q-switched ND:YAG laser (850-1200 mJ/cm2 , 4-5 Hz,spot size 4 mm) spaced 4 weeks apart. Patients were followed monthly for 9 months. RESULTS: After cessation of therapy, the mean mMASI score was lowest in group B (2.34 ± 2.37) followed by groups A (6.38 ± 4.04) and C (7.24 ± 4.95).Mean percentage of mMASI score improvement was 35.91 ± 24.13, 77.47 ± 19.07, and 24.94 ± 27.79 in groups A, B, and C (p < 0.001). There was a significant reduction of telangiectasia in the three groups. Reported side effects were itching & irritation, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and gastritis.

The traditionally used azelaic acid 20% has poor tolerability and low skin absorption rate. AIM: To assess the efficacy and tolerability of the liposomal form of azelaic acid 20% as an adjuvant to oral tranexamic acid in the treatment of melasma.

Oral tranexamic acid 250 mg was taken by both groups as a single oral daily dose. Melasma severity and the patient's QoL were assessed. RESULTS: A significant improvement of melasma was detected in females who used the liposomal form of azelaic acid 20% than those who used hydroquinone 4%. This was associated with a significant positive effect on their QoL. Furthermore, the liposomal form of azelaic acid 20% was more significantly tolerable than hydroquinone 4%.

      "abstract": "Human Hedgehog receptor Patched1 (PTCH1) is able to efflux chemotherapeutics of different chemical structure out of cancer cells thus contributing to multidrug resistance phenomena in tumor treatment. A screening of natural compounds purified from marine sponges led to the identification of the first PTCH1 efflux inhibitor, panicein A hydroquinone (PAH), demonstrated to increase doxorubicin toxicity in vitro and vemurafenib toxicity in vitro and in vivo. In this work we combined different computational techniques to gain molecular insights of the inhibitory activity of PAH and some of its active and inactive analogues. We first performed a thorough characterization and druggability analysis of the main putative substrate binding pockets known from available cryo-electron microscopy structures. Further, dynamical descriptors of the active and inactive PAH analogues were extracted from microsecond-long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in water solution. Finally, a blind ensemble docking methodology coupled with the conformational analysis of compounds enabled rationalization of the interaction between PTCH1 and PAH and derivatives in terms of their intrinsic physico-chemical properties. Our results suggest that the Neck pocket is the preferential binding site for PAH analogues on PTCH1, and that compounds assuming an open cylindric-like shape in solution are most likely to be good binders for PTCH1.",

      "abstract": "Hyperpigmentation is a common concern of patients in aesthetic practice. There are various treatment options, but topical depigmenting agents such as hydroquinone (HQ) are usually a first-line option. Given HQ's side effects and potential controversy over its long-term use from prior animal studies, there is a consumer demand for non-HQ topical formulations that provide similar efficacy, but with a reduced adverse reaction profile to HQ. There is increasing evidence to support the use of selective growth factors, tranexamic acid, niacinamide, arbutin, and Vitamin C in improving hyperpigmentation. This study sought to determine whether a non-HQ topical formulation, composed of the aforementioned ingredients, could provide similar or improved efficacy to topical HQ, but with a reduced adverse reaction profile. This single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled split face study investigated the safety and efficacy of a proprietary product SKNB19 compared with hydroquinone 4% (HQ4%) in treating hyperpigmentation. Eighteen adult subjects with facial pigmentation were randomly assigned to have one side of their face treated with SKNB19 twice a day (morning and night application) and the other treated with HQ4% applied nightly. Patients used a 5-point scale to self-assess their overall appearance, and a 4-point scale to assess redness, irritation, and tolerability to the skin-brightening creams. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test whether there was a statistical difference between the two treatments. Three-dimensional imaging was performed before treatment was administered and again 1 month following treatment initiation using a Canfield Vectra 3D imaging system. Five independent reviewers comprising two dermatologists, two facial plastic surgeons, and one oculoplastic surgeon graded and performed a qualitative comparative assessment of each side of the face using the before and after images. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test whether there was a statistical difference in overall appearance between SKNB19- and HQ4%-treated sides. SKNB19-treated hyperpigmentation had a statistically significant improvement in the overall appearance of hyperpigmentation and was shown to be 28.5% better than HQ4%-treated skin in the patient self-assessment and 27% better than HQ4%-treated skin in the independent reviewer assessment. On pair-wise comparison, the independent reviewer assessment also showed that 88.2% of the SKNB19-treated sides appeared equal or better than the HQ4%-treated sides. One patient dropped out of the study because of severe intolerance to HQ4%. No patients experienced intolerance to SKNB19, and all were able to continue its use without adverse effects. SKNB19-treated hyperpigmentation also had a statistically significant reduction in irritation when compared with HQ4%-treated hyperpigmentation. Patients reported a reduction in redness when using SKNB19 as opposed to HQ4%, but these figures did not reach statistical significance. This study supports that SKNB19, a recently developed non-HQ proprietary product, is safe and effective in improving hyperpigmentation. SKNB19 significantly improved the appearance of hyperpigmentation when compared with HQ4% in both patient self-assessment and independent reviewer assessment. SKNB19 exhibited a lower adverse reaction profile and was significantly better tolerated than HQ4%. SKNB19 should be considered as a safe and effective non-HQ alternative for the management of hyperpigmentation.",

      "abstract": "Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is a prevalent and endemic swine pathogen that causes significant economic losses in the global swine industry. Due to the emergence of PRV mutant strains in recent years, vaccines can't completely prevent and control PRV infection. Therefore, research and development of new vaccines and drugs with inhibitory effects on PRV are of great significance in the prevention and treatment of PR. In this study, we firstly screened a library of 44 FDA-approved drugs and found that hydroquinone (HQ) displayed high anti-PRV activity by inhibiting PRV adsorption onto and internalization into cells. This study revealed that hydroquinone treatment stimulated genes associated with the PI3K-AKT signal pathway. HQ increased AKT mRNA production and activated AKT phosphorylation in N2a cells. This finding suggests that HQ significantly inhibits PRV replication by activating the phosphorylation of AKT. We also conducted in vivo experiments in mice. Hydroquinone significantly reduced the viral loads in mouse tissues and the mortality after PRV infection. The above results indicate that hydroquinone significantly inhibits the replication of PRV mutant strain ZJ01 in ICR mice and has an inhibitory effect on PRV. This study will contribute to the development of a novel prophylactic and therapeutic strategy against PRV infection.",

AIMS: To evaluate the treatment efficacy and safety of 585-nm QSNYL and 4% HQ cream combination vs 4% HQ cream alone for telangiectatic melasma in the skin phototypes III-V. PATIENTS/METHODS: Twenty-one Thai female patients with telangiectatic melasma and Fitzpatrick skin phototypes (FPTs) III-V were randomly treated with the 585-nm QSNYL on one side of the face for five sessions at 2-week intervals. All patients were assigned to apply HQ cream daily at night on both sides of the face for 10 weeks and a broad-spectrum sunscreen regularly throughout the study. The treatment efficacy and safety were evaluated using the Modified Melasma Area and Severity Index (mMASI), biometric evaluation, patient assessment, and adverse effects. RESULTS: The combination-treated side yielded more significant improvement of mMASI than the topical-treated side at weeks 2, 4, and 8, respectively. However, 19% of the patients developed postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) on the laser-treated side, especially in FPTs IV-V and rebound hyperpigmentation. There was a significant improvement of hemoglobin and melanin index, but without statistical difference between the two treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of 585-nm QSNYL and HQ treatment yields treatment efficacy and skin rejuvenation effects for telangiectatic melasma. Nonetheless, a high incidence of PIH and rebound hyperpigmentation is adversely developed in dark FPT. Thus, this laser treatment should be cautiously applied in those with dark FPTs IV-V to avoid laser-induced pigment alteration.",

With current skin lightening treatments, there are concerns about irritation leading to worsening of their underlying inflammatory skin condition or worsening of PIH. CASE: A 20-year-old woman with Fitzpatrick skin type (FST) V presented with facial hyperpigmented patches since childhood following an intermittent erythematous, pruritic facial rash. Skin biopsy confirmed PIH secondary to possible burnt-out morphea. Treatment with topical adapalene 0.1% gel and triple combination cream (containing hydroquinone, topical corticosteroids, and retinoids) proved unsuccessful. Treatment with cysteamine 5% cream over 4 months resulted in significant improvement with a reduction in the melanin index. DISCUSSION: The current recommendation for first-line treatment in PIH is hydroquinone or triple combination cream containing hydroquinone, which can be associated with significant short- and long-term side effects. Cysteamine 5% cream is one of the latest cosmetic skin lightening products. It is hypothesized that cysteamine reduces melanin production by inhibiting key melanogenic enzymes required in melanogenesis. Its efficacy and tolerability have been demonstrated in two randomized controlled trials against placebo in patients with melasma. This report demonstrates a successful use of cysteamine 5% cream in a patient with chronic severe PIH.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Melasma is a commonly acquired disorder of hyperpigmentation that often poses a therapeutic challenge for dermatologists. Recently, cysteamine cream has shown promising results compared to placebo. This study aims to determine the efficacy of cysteamine cream compared to hydroquinone cream in the treatment of melasma. METHODS: A randomised, double-blinded, single-centre trial was conducted in Victoria, Australia. 20 recruited participants were given either cysteamine cream or hydroquinone cream for 16 weeks. The primary outcome measure was a change in the modified Melasma Area and Severity Index (mMASI). Quality of life at baseline and week 16 as well as standard digital photography at each follow-up visit was assessed as secondary outcome measures. RESULTS: At week 16, 14 participants completed the study with 5 participants in the cysteamine group and 9 patients in the hydroquinone group. In the intention to treat analysis, there was a 1.52 ± 0.69 (21.3%) reduction in mMASI for the cysteamine group and a 2.96 ± 1.15 (32%) reduction in the hydroquinone group. The difference between groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.3). Hydroquinone cream was generally better tolerated that cysteamine cream. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that topical cysteamine may have comparable efficacy to topical hydroquinone. Cysteamine thus provides a possible alternative to patients and clinicians who wish to avoid or rotate off topical hydroquinone. While side effects were more common for participants using cysteamine compared with hydroquinone, these were mild and reversible. Larger studies comparing cysteamine and hydroquinone are required to support these findings.",

Topical 5% cysteamine is an antioxidant and tyrosinase inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in the treatment of melasma. However, to date, no study has compared the performance of topical cysteamine to hydroquinone for facial melasma. METHODS: A quasi-randomized, multicenter, evaluator-blinded clinical trial was conducted on 40 women with facial melasma who were submitted to the nightly application of 5% cysteamine (CYS) or 4% hydroquinone (HQ) on hyperpigmented areas for 120 days. Both groups were required to use tinted sunscreen (SPF 50; PPD 19). Subjects were assessed at the inclusion and after 60 and 120 days of treatment for mMASI, MELASQoL, and the difference in colorimetric luminosity between melasma and the adjacent unaffected skin. The Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale was used to assess the difference in the appearance of the skin through standardized photographs. RESULTS: The mean reduction of the mMASI scores was 24% for CYS and 41% for HQ (P = 0.015) at 60 days, and 38% for CYS and 53% for HQ (P = 0.017) at 120 days. The photographic evaluation revealed up to 74% improvement for both groups, without statistically significant difference between them (P = 0.087). The MELASQoL score showed a progressive decrease for both groups over time, despite the greater reduction for HQ after 120 days (P = 0.018). Colorimetric assessment disclosed progressive depigmenting in both groups, without statistically significant difference between them (P > 0.160). No severe adverse effects were identified in either group. Erythema and burning were the most important local adverse effects with cysteamine, although their frequency did not differ between groups (P > 0.170). CONCLUSION: Cysteamine proved to be safe, well-tolerated, and effective, despite its inferior performance to hydroquinone in decreasing mMASI and MELASQoL in the treatment of melasma.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Cigarette smoking has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AMD. Integrin dysfunctions have been associated with AMD. Herein, we investigate the effect of risuteganib (RSG), an integrin regulator, on RPE cell injury induced by hydroquinone (HQ), an important oxidant in cigarette smoke. METHODS: Cultured human RPE cells were treated with HQ in the presence or absence of RSG. Cell death, mitochondrial respiration, reactive oxygen species production, and mitochondrial membrane potential were measured by flow cytometry, XFe24 analyzer, and fluorescence plate reader, respectively. Whole transcriptome analysis and gene expression were analyzed by Illumina RNA sequencing and quantitative PCR, respectively. F-actin aggregation was visualized with phalloidin. Levels of heme oxygenase-1, P38, and heat shock protein 27 proteins were measured by Western blot. RESULTS: HQ induced necrosis and apoptosis, decreased mitochondrial bioenergetics, increased reactive oxygen species levels, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, increased F-actin aggregates, and induced phosphorylation of P38 and heat shock protein 27. HQ, but not RSG alone, induced substantial transcriptome changes that were regulated by RSG cotreatment. RSG cotreatment significantly protected against HQ-induced necrosis and apoptosis, prevented HQ-reduced mitochondrial bioenergetics, decreased HQ-induced reactive oxygen species production, improved HQ-disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced F-actin aggregates, decreased phosphorylation of P38 and heat shock protein 27, and further upregulated HQ-induced heme oxygenase-1 protein levels. CONCLUSIONS: RSG has no detectable adverse effects on healthy RPE cells, whereas RSG cotreatment protects against HQ-induced injury, mitochondrial dysfunction, and actin reorganization, suggesting a potential role for RSG therapy to treat retinal diseases such as AMD.",

However, unmodified cotton fabrics are difficult to be dyed through enzyme catalysis due to the lack of affinity of biosynthesized dyes to cotton fibers. In order to improve the enzyme-catalyzed dyeability of cotton fibers, chitosan was used to coat cotton fabrics as template. A novel and facile bio-coloration technique using laccase catalysis of hydroquinone was developed to dye chitosan-templated cotton fabrics. The polymerization of hydroquinone with the template of chitosan under the laccase catalysis was monitored by ultraviolet-vis spectrophotometer on the absorbance of reaction solution. A significant peak of UV-vis spectrum at 246 nm corresponding to large conjugated structures appeared and increased with increasing the duration of enzymatic catalysis. The effect of different treatment conditions on the laccase-catalyzed dyeing of cotton fabric was investigated to determine their optimal parameters of laccase-catalyzed coloration. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy spectra demonstrated the formation of H-bond and Schiff base reaction between chitosan and polymerized hydroquinone. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that the surface of dyed cotton fiber was much rougher than that of the control sample. Moreover, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy also revealed the existence of the chitosan/polymerized hydroquinone complex and polymerized hydroquinone on the dyed cotton fibers. This chitosan-templated approach offers possibility for biological dyeing coloration of cotton fabrics and other cellulosic materials."

AIMS: In this study, we decided to evaluate the efficacy of microneedling plus tranexamic acid in comparison with 4% hydroquinone in the treatment of melasma. METHODS: This is a single-blind randomized clinical trial on 70 participants with 14% dropout, and therefore, 60 patients with melasma completed the study. Patients were randomized based on simple randomization in 2 groups of A (microneedling plus topical 4% tranexamic acid, monthly) and B (topical 4% hydroquinone, nightly). Evaluation of mean MASI score, patient and physician assessments was performed at 4th, 8th and12th weeks of the treatment. Statistical analysis was performed by paired t test, chi-square test and Fisher's exact test, respectively. RESULTS: Sixty women (30 patients in each group) were completed the study. Mean MASI score in group A was significantly lower at the end of the treatment (6.84 ± 4.31) than at the baseline (12.89 ± 5.16) (P < .01). Mean MASI score in group B was significantly lower at the end of the treatment (7.16 ± 4.38) than at the baseline (13.56 ± 4.88) (P < .01). There was no statistical difference between 2 groups regarding MASI score, physician and patient assessments during the treatment. Percentage of patient satisfaction was significantly higher than physician satisfaction in both treatment groups (P < .01). CONCLUSION: In our study, the combination of microneedling with tranexamic acid did not differ from 4% hydroquinone in the treatment of melasma.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Skin bleaching is the act of using steroid- and chemical-containing products to lighten the skin. Hydroquinone and kojic acid are often used in skin bleaching creams. Hydroquinone was suspected to be harmful. This study investigated the effects of kojic acid and hydroquinone on the skin of adult female Wistar rats and the potential use of aloe vera for amelioration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty [n=80] adult female Wistar rats with an average weight of 120 g were randomly divided into eight groups, marked A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. Group A animals served as the control group; group B was treated with 2% hydroquinone, group C was treated with 2% kojic acid, group D was treated with 4% hydroquinone, group E was treated with 4% kojic acid, group F was treated with 2% hydroquinone and 2% kojic acid, group G was treated with 4% hydroquinone and 4% kojic acid, and group H was treated with 4% hydroquinone, 4% kojic acid, and aloe vera. The preparations were applied to the tail skin and treatment lasted 28 days. Skin samples were excised and processed using H&E, Masson's trichrome, and p65 immunohistochemical assays on tissue sections. RESULTS: Hydroquinone caused structural disruptions of the stratum corneum of the epidermis and the overlying keratin. p65 was also prominently expressed in the treated groups. Hydroquinone reduced skin thickness and caused epidermis disruption. DISCUSSION: The prominent expression of p65 in the sections indicated deleterious effects of hydroquinone. Kojic acid was not found to have deleterious effects. Aloe vera prevented extensive disruption of stratum corneum by hydroquinone. The use of hydroquinone in skin lightening creams might raise health concerns. Aloe vera could be protective against hydroquinone."

The present study aims to evaluate the protective effects of S-allyl L-cysteine (SAC), a bioactive component from aged garlic extracts, on the oxidative stress-related apoptosis of RPE cells and to investigate the potential underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, flow cytometry, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining were performed to evaluate the effects of SAC on the hydroquinone-treated human ARPE19 cells. The Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production was measured by virtue of flow cytometry or determined under an inverted fluorescence microscope. Furthermore, the expression of antioxidant factor Nrf2, as well as downstream antioxidant genes, including NQO1, SOD1, SOD2, and HO1 was assessed in hydroquinone stimulated ARPE19 cells, in the presence or absence of SAC pretreatment. RESULTS: Hydroquinone incitement contributed to a marked decrease in cell viability, but enhanced cell apoptosis, whereas SAC addition did not cause significant alterations. When cells were pre-treated with SAC, cell proliferation was dramatically enhanced whereas apoptosis was mitigated, and the ROS generation induced by hydroquinone was also significantly suppressed, indicating a prominent function of SAC in preventing ARPE19 cells from oxidant-related apoptosis. The elevated expression levels of Nrf2 and other antioxidant genes driven by hydroquinone were downregulated by SAC addition. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that SAC can effectively attenuate hydroquinone-induced oxidative damage in human RPE cells. Our work is the first to demonstrate that SAC modulates oxidative stress-induced RPE apoptosis, thereby potentially proving new insights into the treatment of AMD.",

The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of oral tranexamic acid in combination with hydroquinone cream in the treatment of melasma. METHODS: Subjects with moderate-to-severe melasma were enrolled. Group A received hydroquinone 4% cream, sunscreen and oral tranexamic acid, while Group B received hydroquinone 4% cream, sunscreen and placebo capsules for 3 months. All subjects had an additional 3-month follow-up visit on sunscreen alone. The primary outcome measure was change in modified Melasma Area and Severity Index (mMASI) score. In addition, the melanin index was measured using a mexameter. RESULTS: Fifty subjects were enrolled, and all completed the study. There was a 55% reduction in mMASI after 3 months from mean 8.96 (SD 2.45) to 4.0 (SD 1.6) in Group A compared to 10.9% from mean 8.53 (SD 2.04) to 7.6 (SD 2.0) in Group B. Three months after oral and topical therapy was discontinued, there was a 42% decrease in mMASI compared to baseline in Group A (mean 5.1 SD 1.7) vs. 4.7% in Group B (mean 8.1 SD 2.0). No serious adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of oral tranexamic acid and topical hydroquinone is more effective than hydroquinone alone in the treatment of melasma.",

      "abstract": "Hydroquinone (HQ), one of the main metabolites of benzene, is a well-known human leukemogen. However, the specific mechanism of how benzene or HQ contributes to the development of leukemia is unknown. In a previous study, we demonstrated the upregulation of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) expression in HQ-induced malignant transformed TK6 (HQ-TK6) cells. Here, we investigated whether a regulatory loop between the long noncoding RNA FAS-AS1 and DNMT3b exists in HQ-TK6 cells and benzene-exposed workers. We found that the expression of FAS-AS1 was downregulated in HQ-TK6 cells and workers exposed to benzene longer than 1.5 years via histone acetylation, and FAS-AS1 expression was negatively correlated with the time of benzene exposure. Restoration of FAS-AS1 in HQ-TK6 cells promoted apoptosis and inhibited tumorigenicity in female nude mice. Interestingly, treatment with a DNMT inhibitor (5-aza-2-deoxycytidine), histone deacetylase inhibitor (trichostatin A), or DNMT3b knockout led to increased FAS-AS1 through increased H3K27ac protein expression in HQ-TK6 cells, and DNMT3b knockout decreased H3K27ac and DNMT3b enrichment to the FAS-AS1 promoter region, which suggested that DNMT3b and/or histone acetylation involve FAS-AS1 expression. Importantly, restoration of FAS-AS1 resulted in reduced expression of DNMT3b and SIRT1 and increased expression of FAS in both HQ-TK6 cells and xenograft tissues. Moreover, the average DNMT3b expression in 17 paired workers exposed to benzene within 1.5 years was decreased, but that of the remaining 103 paired workers with longer exposure times was increased. Conversely, DNMT3b was negatively correlated with FAS-AS1 expression. Both FAS-AS1 and DNMT3b influenced the enrichment of H3K27ac in the FAS promoter region by regulating the expression of SIRT1, consequently upregulating FAS expression. Taken together, these observations demonstrate crosstalk between FAS-AS1 and DNMT3b via a mutual inhibition loop and indicate a new mechanism by which FAS-AS1 regulates the expression of FAS in benzene-related carcinogenesis.",

There are a variety of medical and surgical treatment options for skin graft darkening. AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of topical hydroquinone, tretinoin, and betamethasone application on hyperpigmentation of skin grafts. METHODS: A skin defect was created on the backs of 17 Long-Evans rats, and a 2 × 2 cm split-thickness skin graft was sutured. After 15 days, eight rats in the treatment group were treated with application of hydroquinone, tretinoin, and betamethasone cream, while nine rats in the control group were not treated. Visual evaluation was performed on days 45 and 75 using the Melasma Severity Scale (MSS), and histological evaluation was performed on day 75 using S100 and Masson Fontana (MF) staining. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Mean MSS values of the treatment group on days 45 were significantly lower compared to the control group (P = .036). On day 75, the mean MSS score of the treatment group was also lower; however, the difference was not statistically significant (P = .302). Histological evaluation of S100 and MF staining scores of the treatment group showed fewer melanocytes and fewer pigments in epidermis (P = .009 and P = .002, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that topical application of hydroquinone, tretinoin, and betamethasone reduced the hyperpigmentation, number of melanocytes, and melanin pigment intensity that developed on the rat skin graft models. Clinical studies are needed to assess whether a similar effect could be observed with human skin grafts.",

      "abstract": "Hydroquinone (HQ), a major metabolic product of benzene, causes acute myeloid leukemia (AML) elicited by benzene exposure. Past studies found that continuous exposure of human AML U937 cells to HQ selectively produces malignant U937/HQ cells in which FOXP3 upregulation modulates malignant progression. Other studies revealed that AMPK promotes TET2 activity on DNA demethylation and that TET2 activity is crucial for upregulating FOXP3 expression. This study was conducted to elucidate whether compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, blocked the AMPK-TET2-FOXP3 axis in AML and in HQ-selected malignant cells. We found higher levels of AMPKα, TET2, and FOXP3 expression in U937/HQ cells compared to U937 cells. Treatment of parental Original Article and HQ-selected malignant U937 cells with compound C induced ROS-mediated p38 MAPK activation, leading to a suppression of AMPKα, TET2, and FOXP3 expression. Moreover, compound C induced apoptosis and mTOR-independent autophagy. The suppression of the autophagic flux inhibited the apoptosis of compound C-treated U937 and U937/HQ cells, whereas co-treatment with rapamycin, a mTOR inhibitor, sensitized the two cell lines to compound C cytotoxicity. Overexpression of AMPKα1 or pretreatment with autophagic inhibitors abrogated compound C-induced autophagy and suppression of TET2 and FOXP3 expression. Restoration of AMPKα1 or FOXP3 expression increased cell survival after treatment with compound C. In conclusion, our results show that compound C suppresses AMPK/TET2 axis-mediated FOXP3 expression and induces autophagy-dependent apoptosis in parental and HQ-selected malignant U937 cells, suggesting that the AMPK/TET2/FOXP3 axis is a promising target for improving AML therapy and attenuating benzene exposure-induced AML progression.",

During the initial concentration range finding experiment, recently fertilized embryos were exposed for five days to 5, 25, 125, and 625 µg Se/L (as SeMet). These exposures informed the second experiment in which embryos were exposed to two concentrations of SeMet (25 and 125 µg Se/L) and 75 mg/L tBOOH either with (tBOOH-t, 25-t, 125-t) or without (tBOOH, 25, 125) a 4 h 100 µg/L tBHQ pre-treatment. Survival, hatchability, time to hatch, the frequency and severity of deformities (total and type), and changes in the expression of seven antioxidant-associated genes were determined. Exposures to SeMet and tBOOH reduced hatchability, increased time to hatch, decreased survival, increased the incidence and severity of deformities, and increased glutathione-disulfide reductase (gsr) expression in the pre-treated tBOOH treatment group."

Therefore, we investigated the anticancer activity of the novel 5-LO inhibitor derivative 3-tridecyl-4,5-dimethoxybenzene-1,2-diol hydroquinone (EA-100C red) on glioblastoma (GBM) cell growth. Cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay. The effects of the compound on apoptosis, oxidative stress and autophagy were assessed by flow cytometry (FACS). The mode of action was confirmed by Taqman apoptosis array, Real Time qPCR, confocal microscopy analysis and the western blotting technique. Our results showed that EA-100C Red had a higher anti-proliferative effect on LN229 as compared to U87MG cells. The compound induced a significant increase of apoptosis and autophagy and up-regulated pro-apoptotic genes (Bcl3, BNIP3L, and NFKBIA) in both GBM cell lines. In this light, we studied the effects of EA-100C red on the expression of CHOP and XBP1, that are implicated in ER-stress-mediated cell death. In summary, our findings revealed that EA-100C red induced ER stress-mediated apoptosis associated to autophagy in GBM cells through CHOP and Beclin1 up-regulation and activation of caspases 3, 9, JNK and NF-kappaB pathway. On these bases, EA-100C red could represent a promising compound for anti-cancer treatment.",

Results: mMASI decreased significantly from 3.37 to 2.60 at week 4, and to 2.40 at week 8 (P-values=0.00 and 0.01, respectively). Also, E and L values improved significantly after 8 weeks of treatment (P=0.01 and 0.00, respectively). Skin melanin index decreased from 237.49 AU to 196.30 AU at week 8 (P=0.01). Also echo density of dermis increased significantly after 8 weeks of treatment (P=0.029). Almost all participants experienced some degrees of pruritus, scaling, and erythema, esspecially during the first month of application, which were generally mild and tolerable. The mean satisfaction of patients with the treatment was 6.77. Conclusion: The triple combination formula was reasonably safe and effective for treatment of melasma in Middle Eastern patients."

      "abstract": "α-Arbutin is an effective skin-whitening cosmetic ingredient and hyperpigmentation therapy agent. It can be synthesized by one-step enzymatic glycosylation of hydroquinone (HQ), but limited by the low yield. Amylosucrase (Amy-1) from Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris 8004 was recently identified with high HQ glycosylation activity. In this study, whole-cell transformation by Amy-1 was optimized and process scale-up was evaluated in 5000-L reactor. In comparison with purified Amy-1, whole-cell catalyst of recombinant E. coli displays better tolerance against inhibitors (oxidized products of HQ) and requires lower molar ratio of sucrose and HQ to reach high conversion rate (> 99%). Excess accumulation of glucose (0.6-1.0 M) derived from sucrose hydrolysis inhibits HQ glycosylation rate by 46-60%, which suggests the importance of balancing HQ glycosylation rate and sucrose hydrolysis rate by adjusting the activity of whole-cell catalyst and HQ-fed rate. Using optimal conditions, 540 mM of final concentration and 95% of molar conversion rate were obtained within 13-18 h in laboratory scale. For industrial scale-up production, 398 mM and 375 mM of final concentration with high conversion rates (~ 95%) were obtained in 3500-L and 4000-L of reaction volume, respectively. These yields and productivities (4.5-4.9 kg kL-1 h-1) were the highest by comparing to the best we known. Hence, high-yield production of α-arbutin by batch-feeding whole-cell biotransformation was successfully achieved in the 5000-L reaction scale."

The Si-CQDs were prepared through hydrothermal treatment of N-[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]-ethylenediamine. If HQ is oxidized in a solution of the Si-CQDs, 1,4-benzoquinone will be formed which quenches the blue fluorescence (with excitation/emission peaks at 360/435 nm) of the Si-CQDs. Simultaneously, intense green fluorescence (with a emission peak at 513 nm) appears, probably due to the formation of n-π clathrates or of a quinone imine between 1,4-benzoquinone and amino groups on the surface of the Si-CQDs. The ratio of the green and blue fluorescence can be applied to the determination of HQ with a 0.077 μM detection limit. The analytical range extends from 1 to 40 μM.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The management of melasma is still challenging, and new treatment modalities with favorable side effect profile are required. Methimazole, a peroxidase inhibitor, seems to have a beneficial effect in the management of melasma but there is a paucity of studies for evaluation of its efficacy. This double-blinded trial was aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methimazole vs hydroquinone 4% which is the gold standard treatment in the management of melasma. METHODS: Fifty patients with melasma were enrolled and randomly divided into two groups to receive 4% hydroquinone or 5% methimazole once daily for 8 weeks. Forty patients completed the study. The clinical response was assessed at 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks after treatment by MASI score, patient satisfaction, and physician scores. RESULTS: Both groups showed a reduction in the MASI score at the 8th week which was more significant in hydroquinone group but higher relapse rate was also observed in this group after discontinuing the drug. The side effects were similar between groups. Also, patient and physician satisfaction scores were also more in favor of hydroquinone 4%. CONCLUSION: Methimazole could be an alternative treatment of melasma alone or in combination with other depigmenting drugs. Although not as effective as hydroquinone, the noncytotoxic and nonmutagenic aspects of methimazole may make it a promising alternative for the treatment of melasma.",
