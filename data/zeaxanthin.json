      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The Maillard reaction generates acrylamide (ACR), a toxic compound commonly found in laboratory and industrial settings. ACR exposure, both short-term and long-term, can damage various organs, notably the central nervous system, through oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. This study explores the potential neuroprotective effects of zeaxanthin (ZEA), known for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties, against ACR-induced toxicity in the rat cerebral cortex. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were subjected to ACR exposure (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection) for 11 days and subsequently, treated with ZEA (20-80 mg/kg, intragastric gavage) for either 11 or 20 days to assess both preventive and therapeutic effects. Locomotor behavior was evaluated using a gait score test, while biochemical analyses measured malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels, inflammatory markers interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and apoptotic markers (cleaved caspase-3) in the cerebral cortex. RESULTS: ACR exposure impaired locomotion in the animals, but ZEA treatment significantly improved gait scores when administered preventatively (from days 6-11) or therapeutically (from days 6-20). ACR also led to increased MDA levels and depleted GSH content in brain tissue, and it elevated IL-1β, TNF-α, and cleaved caspase-3 in the cerebral cortex. However, ZEA supplementation, along with vitamin E, effectively reversed these alterations compared to the ACR-exposed group. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, ZEA demonstrates both preventive and therapeutic effects against ACR-induced neurotoxicity. These findings suggest that ZEA could serve as an effective preventive agent by countering ACR-induced damage through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic mechanisms."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Olanzapine (OLZ) is used by some patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Some of its side effects include weight gain and metabolic syndrome. Zeaxanthin (Zx), a yellow pigment found in egg yolk as well as some yellow and orange plants and fruits, is an anti-obesity factor that aids in the treatment of metabolic disorders. The effects of Zx on metabolic disorders caused by OLZ were investigated in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Female Wistar rats were randomly divided into seven groups (n=6): 1. control (vehicle); 2. OLZ (5 mg/kg, 14 days, intraperitoneal (i.p.)); 3-5. OLZ + Zx (12.5, 25, and 50 mg/kg, 14 days, gavage); 6. OLZ+ metformin (100 mg/kg, 14 days, i.p.); and 7. Zx (50 mg/kg, 14 days). Weight changes were checked every 3 days and food intake was monitored every day. Systolic blood pressure, insulin, blood sugar, triglyceride, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and leptin levels were evaluated on the last day of the study. RESULTS: OLZ caused an increase in weight (84.5% increase on day 15), food intake, blood pressure, triglyceride, LDL, insulin, blood sugar, and leptin compared to the control group (p<0.01 and p<0.001). The use of different doses of Zx (12.5, 25, and 50 mg/kg) and metformin decreased weight (the percentages of weigh reduction on day 15 were 91.92% for Zx (50 mg/kg) and 59.39% for metformin), food intake, systolic blood pressure, triglyceride, LDL, insulin, blood sugar, and leptin compared to the OLZ group. The amounts of cholesterol and HDL were not different in different groups. CONCLUSION: Zx alleviates metabolic abnormalities including hypertension, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia in rats."

      "abstract": "Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), a mycotoxin commonly present in feed, has several toxic effects. AFB1 seems to have a neurotoxic effect that leads to neurobehavioral impairment. On the other hand, Lutein and Zeaxanthin (LUT/ZEA) have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Here, we aimed to compare the effects of AFB1 and the co-treatment with LUT/ZEA on neurobehavioural and biochemical changes viz-a-viz oxido-inflammatory response in male rats' hippocampal and pre-frontal cortexes. Experimental rats of the Wistar strain (n = 40) were randomly grouped into treatment cohorts: Control (corn oil 2 mL/kg), AFB1 (75 μg/kg), LUT/ZEA only (100 mg/kg), AFB1 + LUT/ZEA (75 μg/kg + 100 mg/kg), and AFB1 + LUT/ZEA (75 μg/kg + 200 mg/kg). All groups were administered their respective treatment orally for 28 days, while behavioural tests were conducted using open field tests (OFT), Y-maze, novel object tests (NORT), and forced swim tests (FST) 1 h after treatment on day 26-28. The animals were euthanized on day 29. In the hippocampal and pre-frontal cortex, antioxidant indicators (SOD, CAT, GSH, GST, GPx, TSH), inflammatory mediators (XO, NO, MPO), and acetylcholinesterase activity were measured. Our finding presents the anti-oxidant effect of lutein/Zeaxanthin in the brains of AFB1-intoxicated rats, indicating better cognitive and spatial memory capacity in Y-maze and NORT, an improvement in locomotive and explorative behaviour in OFT and reduction in anxio-depressive-like behaviour in LUT/ZEA co-treated rats. Acetylcholinesterase activity was enhanced in LUT/ZEA co-treated rats. LUT/ZEA co-treatment dampened oxido-inflammatory mediators by decreasing XO, NO, and MPO levels and increasing antioxidant activities (SOD, CAT, GSH, GST, GPx, TSH) in the prefrontal and hippocampal cortices. We surmise that mechanistically, co-treatment with LUT/ZEA effectively lessened AFB1 neurotoxicity through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant pathways and essentially improved the experimental rats' neurobehavioural outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Macular pigment (MP), consisting of lutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z), is believed to provide retinal protection against photo-oxidative damage. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of lutein and zeaxanthin complex 5:1 (extracted from marigold flowers) supplementation on macular pigment optical density (MPOD), contrast sensitivity, and quality of sleep in healthy subjects who exposed themselves to an electronic gadget screen for a minimum of 8 hours every day. This study also aimed to assess the long-term safety of the supplement by administering it for 8 months in one of the groups. The study also assessed the retention effects of lutein and zeaxanthin on MPOD after discontinuation of supplementation. Methods The study was registered with the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI/2022/12/048392). Subjects were screened as per the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects aged 18-55 years with a screen time of at least 8 hours daily and MPOD values below 0.8 were recruited. The study, conducted at Narayana Nethralaya Super Specialty Eye Hospital, Bangalore, spanned from December 2022 to May 2024. This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Of the 96 volunteers screened for this study, 71 were recruited, and 60 completed the study. Subjects were divided into 3 groups, viz. A, B, and C. Group A received lutein 10mg and zeaxanthin 2mg twice daily for the first four months, had a wash-off period of 15 days, and continued with the same supplementation for the remaining four months. Group B received lutein 10mg and zeaxanthin 2mg twice daily for the first four months, had a wash-off period of 15 days, and then switched over to a placebo for the next four months. Group C received a Placebo for the first 4 months, had a wash-off period of 15 days, and then switched over to lutein 10mg and zeaxanthin 2mg for the next four months. All the subjects were given either, lutein and zeaxanthin complex-5:1 or placebo capsules as per the randomization chart prepared computationally. Subjects were analyzed for their MPOD values, contrast sensitivity scores, and quality of sleep. Intraocular pressure, retinal thickness, renal function tests, and liver function tests were conducted during visits to ensure clinical safety. Results After supplementation with the lutein-zeaxanthin complex-5:1, the average MPOD (at 1ᴏ eccentricity) increased significantly. At the first visit, the mean MPOD for Groups A, B, and C were 0.3, 0.22, and 0.29 (right eye) and 0.31, 0.27, and 0.27 (left eye), respectively. At the second visit, these values were 0.61, 0.66, and 0.21 (right eye) and 0.54, 0.53, and 0.2 (left eye). By the third visit, the mean MPOD values were 0.7, 0.65, and 0.38 (right eye) and 0.66, 0.53, and 0.36 (left eye). Supplementation significantly improved MPOD, contrast sensitivity, and the quality of sleep compared to placebo.  Conclusions The supplementation with lutein and zeaxanthin resulted in higher MPOD values as compared to that of the placebo. This intervention also led to improvement in contrast sensitivity and quality of sleep. Lutein and zeaxanthin complex-5:1 may be a promising remedial measure for increasing the MPOD of people exposed to prolonged screen time."

      "abstract": "Since the onset of the COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease 19) pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 has exhibited a high transmission rate, further enhanced by new variants able to better adapt to humans. Addressing this issue has been challenging due to viral resistance and side effects associated with antiviral drugs and vaccines. As a result, there has been a growing interest in plant-derived compounds with antiviral properties. Our study revealed that pistachio extracts significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 viral entry. Employing pseudotyped particles bearing the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, we demonstrated that treatment with pistachio extracts inhibited binding of alpha (α) and omicron (ο) SARS-CoV-2 variants. Furthermore, our study revealed that the pistachio carotenoid zeaxanthin exhibited a different inhibitory activity against two SARS-CoV-2 variants. In silico analyses demonstrated a strong interaction between zeaxanthin and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) domain of the omicron spike (S) protein, thus reducing pseudovirus entry. However, zeaxanthin's weaker interaction with the alpha variant's RBD was insufficient to inhibit entry. Additionally, zeaxanthin suppressed the expression of the host protease TMPRSS2 at the protein level, thereby limiting the internalization of the alpha variant, which relies on TMPRSS2 for cellular entry.",

While lutein and zeaxanthin supplements have been shown to improve ocular health, existing research often overlooks the efficacy of lower dosages and shorter durations of supplementation. This study investigated the effects of combined supplementation with lutein, zeaxanthin, and elderberries in 110 voluntary participants through a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Participants took 6 mg of lutein and 1 mg of zeaxanthin, along with 100 mg elderberry extract once daily for a duration of 20 days. Ocular health was assessed using the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), while immune status was evaluated with the Immune Status Questionnaire (ISQ). RESULTS: Results showed that combined supplementation significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the OSDI scores in the intervention group from 38.15 ± 11.14 to 18.26 ± 5.57, reflecting a 52.2% reduction. A similar trend was observed with the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), indicating significant (p < 0.05) improvement from 5.31 ± 1.62 to 6.73 ± 1.74, equivalent to a 26.7% improvement. Although the intervention group showed a 15.9% improvement in ISQ scores by the study's end, this was not significantly different from the placebo group, suggesting that higher dosages or longer durations may be needed to observe a meaningful effect. Additionally, findings from the Food Frequency Questionnaire revealed that the average dietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin among participants was only 663.49 µg, equating to just 5.5% of the suggested optimal daily intake. This low consumption is concerning, as it is inversely correlated with the risk of ocular diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings support the use of combined supplementation as an adjuvant approach to improving ocular health.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Growing evidence emphasizes the importance of xanthophyll carotenoids and omega-3 fatty acids in eye health. However, the beneficial effects of such supplementation have not been thoroughly discussed among adults with high screen exposure. Current trial evidence on lutein bioavailability is contradictory, and the interactions of dietary intervention with host-related factors remain elusive. This study aims to investigate the comparative effectiveness of supplementation with macular xanthophylls and omega-3 fatty acids on macular pigment optical density (MPOD) and visual function, access the bioavailability of free lutein and lutein ester, and explore the complex interplay between genetic variations, intestinal microbiota, and the dietary intervention in Chinese adults with long-term exposure to digital devices. METHODS: The Lutein, Zeaxanthin, and Omega-3 (LZO) clinical trial is a 24-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 600 participants recruited from research centers, universities, and communities. Individuals are eligible to participate if they are aged over 18 years and use digital devices for over 8 h daily in the last 2 years, and will be randomized to six arms. A total of three visits will be scheduled at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks. The primary outcome is the change in MPOD over the 24-week intervention. The secondary outcomes are changes in visual function (visual acuity, best-corrected visual acuity, contrast and glare sensitivity, critical flicker fusion, reaction time, visuognosis persistence, symptoms and signs of dry eye, retinal thickness, and optical quality), and changes in serum lutein and zeaxanthin concentrations, and erythrocyte membrane omega-3 fatty acids. Genetic variations will be determined using genome-wide genotyping at baseline. 16S rRNA gene sequencing will be utilized to assess microbiome compositional changes before and after intervention. DISCUSSION: The trial is anticipated to establish early interventions to prevent photochemical ocular damage and delay the onset of vision impairment in young adults with long-term repeated exposure to screen-based electronic devices, and provide valuable insights for the development of precision nutrition strategies for maintaining eye health.

RECENT FINDINGS: Lutein and zeaxanthin are phytochemical compounds in the carotenoid group and are synthesised only by plants. All mammals get lutein and zeaxanthin into their bodies by consuming plant-based foods. Especially leafy green vegetables, broccoli, pumpkin, cabbage, spinach and egg yolk are rich in lutein and zeaxanthin. Lutein and zeaxanthin have potential health effects by preventing free radical formation, exhibiting protective properties against oxidative damage and reducing oxidative stress. These compounds have neuroprotective, cardioprotective, ophthalmological, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-osteoporosis, anti-diabetic, anti-obesity, and antimicrobial effects. The preventive properties of lutein and zeaxanthin against numerous diseases have attracted attention recently. Further clinical trials with large samples are needed to make generalisations in the prevention and treatment of diseases and to determine the appropriate doses and forms of lutein and zeaxanthin.",

This study explores the influences of pH (ranged from 1.5 to 7.5) and preheating treatment on the characteristics of caseinates-lutein (LU)/zeaxanthin (ZX) complexes and evaluates the potential application of caseinates as protective carriers in xanthophyll-fortified beverages. The properties and interactions of caseinates and two xanthophylls were systematically investigated utilizing a range of spectroscopic techniques, including ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), fluorescence spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Caseinates were bound to LU/ZX with a binding constant of the order 105 M-1. Furthermore, ZX exhibited a higher affinity for caseinates than LU. In particular, the decreased pH level of complex formulation and the preheating of caseinates at 85 °C strengthened the binding affinity between LU/ZX and caseinates. The caseinate-LU/ZX complexes effectively improved the chemical stability of LU/ZX and achieved a bioaccessibility rate of over 70 %. This study provides a guide for developing commercially available xanthophyll-fortified beverages and further expanding the application of caseinates as encapsulation carriers for extremely hydrophobic nutrients in the food industry.",

Supplementation with the antioxidative macular xanthophylls (lutein [L], zeaxanthin [Z], and meso-zeaxanthin [MZ]) has been shown to aid in the reduction of inflammatory physiologic responses; therefore, we hypothesized that in our study population, supplementation with these xanthophylls would facilitate a systemic reduction in markers of inflammation and cardiovascular lipid oxidation. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this double-blind placebo-controlled supplementation study, participants were randomly allocated to receive the active intervention containing L (10 mg) + MZ (10 mg) + Z (2 mg) or placebo (containing sunflower oil). Serum concentrations of carotenoids (assessed by HPLC), inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α) and oxidized LDL (OxLDL; by solid-phase sandwich ELISA) were measured at baseline and at 6-months. Results showed that over the supplementation period, compared to placebo, the active group demonstrated statistically significant increases in serum concentrations of L, Z, & MZ (p < 0.05), reductions in inflammatory cytokines IL-1β (p < 0.001) and TNF-α (p = 0.003), as well as a corresponding reduction in serum OxLDL (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that L, Z, & MZ supplementation results in decreased serum IL-1β, TNF-α, and OxLDL. This suggests that these carotenoids are acting systemically to attenuate oxidative lipid products and inflammation, thus reducing their contribution to atherosclerotic plaque formation.",

      "abstract": "High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) are key regulators of cellular cholesterol homeostasis but are functionally altered in many chronic diseases. The factors that cause HDL functional loss in chronic disease are not fully understood. It is also unknown what roles antioxidant carotenoids play in protecting HDL against functional loss. The aim of this study was to measure how various disease-associated chemical factors including exposure to (1) Cu2+ ions, (2) hypochlorous acid (HOCL), (3) hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), (4) sialidase, (5) glycosidase, (6) high glucose, (7) high fructose, and (8) acidic pH, and the carotenoid antioxidants (9) lutein and (10) zeaxanthin affect HDL functionality. We hypothesized that some of the modifications would have stronger impacts on HDL particle structure and function than others and that lutein and zeaxanthin would improve HDL function. HDL samples were isolated from generally healthy human plasma and incubated with the corresponding treatments listed above. Cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC), lecithin-cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) activity, and paraoxonase-1 (PON1) activity were measured in order to determine changes in HDL functionality. Median HDL particle diameter was increased by acidic pH treatment and reduced by HOCl, high glucose, high fructose, N-glycosidase, and lutein treatments. Acidic pH, oxidation, and fructosylation all reduced HDL CEC, whereas lutein, zeaxanthin, and sialidase treatment improved HDL CEC. LCAT activity was reduced by acidic pH, oxidation, high fructose treatments, and lutein. PON1 activity was reduced by sialidase, glycosidase, H2O2, and fructose and improved by zeaxanthin and lutein treatment. These results show that exposure to oxidizing agents, high fructose, and low pH directly impairs HDL functionality related to cholesterol efflux and particle maturation, whereas deglycosylation impairs HDL antioxidant capacity. On the other hand, the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin improve or preserve both HDL cholesterol efflux and antioxidant activity but have no effect on particle maturation."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To investigate the therapeutic effects of Zeaxanthin (Zea), one of the oxidized xanthophyll carotenoids belonging to the isoprenoids, on inhibiting the angiogenesis and tumor growth of glioblastoma (GBM) via an in vitro and in vivo study. METHODS: The effects of Zea on the proliferation, adhesion, migration and invasion of human GBM cell lines were detected by cell proliferation assay, cell adhesion assay and Transwell assay. The effect of Zea on angiogenesis was detected by rat aortic ring assay and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in vitro tube formation assay. The effects of Zea on PARP, Caspase 3 and VEGFR2 phosphorylation as well as VEGFR2's downstream signaling pathway were detected by Western blot. The in vivo human GBM xenograft mouse model was employed to study the therapeutic efficacy of Zea. RESULTS: Zea impaired the proliferation, adhesion, migration and invasion of U87 and U251 cells as well as HUVECs. Rat aortic ring experiments displayed Zea significantly inhibited angiogenesis during VEGF-induced microvascular germination. In vitro and in vivo vascular experiments verified that Zea inhibited VEGF-induced HUVEC proliferation and capillary-like tube formation. Additionally, Zea induced GBM cells apoptosis via increasing the expression of cleaved PARP and Caspase 3. In HUVECs and U251 GBM cells, Zea down-regulated VEGF-induced activation of the VEGFR2 kinase pathway. Meanwhile the expression of p-AKT, p-ERK, p-STAT3 and FAK were all attenuated in U251 cells. Moreover, the effects of Zea on GBM cells proliferation could be blocked by VEGFR2 kinase inhibitor SU5408. These results suggest that Zea may hinder GBM angiogenesis and tumor growth through down-regulating a cascade of oncogenic signaling pathways, both through the inhibition of angiogenesis and the anti-tumor mechanism of a direct cytotoxic effect. Besides, Zea inhibits GBM angiogenesis and tumor growth exemplified through a xenograft mouse model in vivo. CONCLUSION: Zea impairs angiogenesis and tumor growth of GBM both in vitro and in vivo. It can be declared that Zea is a potential valuable anticancer candidate for the future treatment strategy of GBM.",

In this study, we tested whether a similar intervention could improve such outcomes in preadolescent children. METHODS: Sixty children (age range 5-12 years) were randomized in a 2:1 ratio in this double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Subjects were supplemented with gummies containing either a combination of 10 mg lutein and 2 mg zeaxanthin (LZ) or placebo for 180 days. Macular pigment optical density (MPOD) was the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoints included serum levels of L and Z, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), critical flicker fusion (CFF), eye strain and fatigue using visual analogue scales (VAS), Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire-Abbreviated (CSHQ-A), and Creyos Health cognitive domains like attention, focus/concentration, episodic memory and learning, visuospatial working memory, and visuospatial processing speed. Safety was assessed throughout the study on the basis of physical examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and monitoring of adverse events. RESULTS: The LZ group showed significant increases in MPOD at all visits post-supplementation, with significant increases as early as day 42 compared to placebo. The LZ group showed significant increases in serum lutein levels, reduced eye strain and fatigue, and improved cognitive performance (focus, episodic memory and learning, visuospatial working memory) at days 90 and 180 compared to placebo. Further, the LZ group showed significant increases in processing speed (CFF), attention, visuospatial processing, and serum Z and BDNF levels on day 180 compared to placebo. No safety concerns were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementing LZ resulted in increased MPOD levels, along with increased serum levels of L, Z, and BDNF. These changes were associated with improved visual and cognitive performances and reduction in eye strain and eye fatigue in the children receiving LZ gummies. The investigational product was safe and well tolerated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: http://ctri.nic.in/ Identifier CTRI/2022/05/042364.",

      "abstract": "Exposure to light-emitting diode (LED) light is a primary cause of retinal damage, resulting in vision loss. Several plant-derived substances, such as lutein and quercetagetin (QCG), show promise in supporting eye health. In this study, the impact of lutein/zeaxanthin (L/Z, Lutemax 2020) and QCG were evaluated individually and together in a rat model of LED-induced retinal damage. A total of 63 Wistar rats were allocated into nine groups (n = 7). For 28 days, the rats received L/Z (10 or 20 mg/kg BW), quercetin (QC, 20 mg/kg BW), QCG (10 or 20 mg/kg BW), or a mixture of different lutein and QCG dosages, after which they were exposed to LED light for 48 h. LED exposure led to a spike in serum malondialdehyde (MDA) and inflammatory cytokines, as well as an increase in retinal NF-κB, ICAM, GFAP, and MCP-1 levels (p < 0.0001 for all). It also reduced serum antioxidant enzyme activities and retinal Nrf2, HO-1, GAP43, NCAM, and outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness (p < 0.0001 for all). However, administering L/Z and QCG, particularly a 1:1 combination of L/Z and QCG at 20 mg/kg, effectively reversed these changes. The treatment suppressed NF-κB, ICAM, GFAP, and MCP-1 while enhancing Nrf2, HO-1, GAP43, and NCAM and preventing ONL thickness reduction in LED-induced retinal damage rats. In conclusion, while LED light exposure caused retinal damage, treatment with L/Z, QC, and QCG, particularly a combined L/Z and QCG regimen, exhibited protective effects on the retina. This is possibly due to the modulation of neuroplasticity markers and nuclear transcription factors in the rats' retinal cells."

The physical and chemical properties of GCWSS and complex were investigated using scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The results showed that the cold water solubility of the pulsed electric field-treated porous granular cold-water-soluble starch (PEF-P-GCWSS) increased by 12.81% compared to granular cold-water-soluble starch (GCWSS). The pulsed electric field treatment also increased the oil absorption of PEF-P-GCWSS was improved by 15.32% compared to porous granular cold-water-soluble starch (P-GCWSS). PEF-P-GCWSS was effective in encapsulating zeaxanthin, which provided a good protection for zeaxanthin. The zeaxanthin-saturated solubility in water of PPG-Z was increased by 56.72% compared with free zeaxanthin. The zeaxanthin embedded in PEF-P-GCWSS was able to be released slowly during gastric digestion and released rapidly during intestinal digestion."

Plants are rich sources of novel antiviral, pharmacologically active agents that provide several advantages, including reduced side effects, less resistance, low toxicity, and different mechanisms of action. In the present work, the antiviral activity of Californian natural raw (NRRE) and roasted unsalted (RURE) pistachio polyphenols-rich extracts was evaluated against HSV-1 using VERO cells. Two different extraction methods, with or without n-hexane, were used. Results showed that n-hexane-extracted NRRE and RURE exerted an antiviral effect against HSV-1, blocking virus binding on the cell surface, affecting viral DNA synthesis as well as accumulation of ICP0, UL42, and Us11 viral proteins. Additionally, the identification and quantification of phenolic compounds by RP-HPLC-DAD confirmed that extraction with n-hexane exclusively accumulated tocopherols, carotenoids, and xanthophylls. Amongst these, zeaxanthin exhibited strong antiviral activity against HSV-1 (CC50: 16.1 µM, EC50 4.08 µM, SI 3.96), affecting both the viral attachment and penetration and viral DNA synthesis. Zeaxanthin is a dietary carotenoid that accumulates in the retina as a macular pigment. The use of pistachio extracts and derivates should be encouraged for the topical treatment of ocular herpetic infections.",

We questioned the long-term benefit and thus analyzed case-control 5-year patient data of trial participants and additional participants with 5-year follow-up, also performing cost-utility and cost-benefit analyses. METHODS: Consecutive, unilateral nAMD patient outcomes for those taking 20 mg Zx supplementation orally for ≥ 5 years were compared with the Comparison of AMD Treatments Trials (CATT) 5-year historical controls for fellow-eye nAMD conversion. Eleven-year mean life expectancy, cost-utility and cost-benefit models were undertaken employing a 3% discount rate and 2020 US real dollars. RESULTS: Among 227 consecutive patients with nAMD/Zx-supplementation, 202 (90%) had 5-year follow-up. The fellow-eye nAMD 5-year conversion incidence using a Kaplan-Meier cumulative event estimate was 22% (49/227), versus 48% (167/348) with CATT control data (p < 0.0001). An 11-year cost-utility model with estimates for years 6-11 demonstrated a 0.42 (7.7%) QALY (quality-adjusted life-year) gain, including 3 months of life saved per patient due to decreased nAMD fellow-eye conversion. This yielded a direct ophthalmic medical cost perspective, incremental cost-utility ratio (CUR) of -$576/QALY and a societal cost perspective CUR of -$125,071/QALY. Zx supplementation for all 2020 US unilateral nAMD cases would have theoretically saved society, primarily patients, $6.0 billion over 11 years, a 1531% return on investment (ROI), or 31.3% annual ROI, on Zx costs. CONCLUSIONS: Oral zeaxanthin supplementation for unilateral nAMD patients appears to decrease fellow-eye long-term incidence and is cost-effective and financially rewarding. It is dominant vs. no supplementation in patients presenting with unilateral nAMD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT01527435."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Oral lutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z) supplementation enhances macular pigment optical density (MPOD) and plays a protective role in the development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy (FLIO) is a novel in vivo retinal imaging method that has been shown to correlate to classical MPOD measurements and might contribute to a metabolic mapping of the retina in the future. Our aim was to show that oral supplementation of L and Z affects the FLIO signal in a positive way in patients with AMD. METHODS: This was a prospective, single center, open label cohort study. Patients with early and intermediate AMD received oral L and Z supplementation during three months, and were observed for another three months after therapy termination. All visits included measurements of clinical parameters, serum L and Z concentration, MPOD measurements using heterochromatic flicker photometry, dual wavelength autofluorescence imaging, and FLIO. Correlation analysis between FLIO and MPOD were performed. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients completed the follow up period. Serum L and Z concentrations significantly increased during supplementation (mean difference 244.8 ng/ml; 95% CI: 81.26-419.9, and 77.1 ng/ml; 95% CI: 5.3-52.0, respectively). Mean MPOD units significantly increased (mean difference 0.06; 95% CI: 0.02-0.09; at 0.5°, 202; 95% CI: 58-345; at 2°, 1033; 95% CI: 288-1668; at 9° of eccentricity, respectively) after three months of supplementation with macular xanthophylls, which included L and Z. Median FLIO lifetimes in the foveal center significantly decreased from 277.3 ps (interquartile range 230.2-339.1) to 261.0 ps (interquartile range 231.4-334.4, p = 0.027). All parameters returned to near-normal values after termination of the nutritional supplementation. A significant negative correlation was found between FLIO and MPOD (r2 = 0.57, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: FLIO is able to detect subtle changes in MPOD after L and Z supplementation in patients with early and intermediate AMD. Our findings confirm the previous described negative correlation between FLIO and MPOD. Macular xanthophylls seem to contribute to short foveal lifetimes.

Residual digestive enzymes damaged the Caco-2 monolayer and necessitated the requirements for the additional clean-up of the digesta. Several digesta cleanup treatments were examined, and the C18 column, along with AEBSF inhibitor, was selected as the most effective treatment. However, the cleanup treatment reduced lutein, zeaxanthin, and ferulic acid concentrations. The bioaccessibility of lutein from muffins was high at 92-94% (without clean-up) and 81-86% (with cleanup); however, the cellular uptake was low (7-9%). The bioaccessibility and cellular uptake (4-11%) of zeaxanthin were lower than lutein. Ferulic acid from muffins exhibited a wide range of bioaccessibility for non-cleanup (105-229%) and clean-up (53-133%) digesta samples; however, cellular uptake was very low (0.5-1.8%). Bread made from wheat/HCS had higher lutein bioaccessibility (47-80%) than the control bread (42%), with an apical cellular uptake ranging from 4.3 to 9.2%. Similar to muffins, the bioaccessibility of zeaxanthin from bread was lower than lutein, while ferulic acid had a fairly high bioaccessibility at 98-103% (without clean-up) and 81-102% (with cleanup); however, zeaxanthin cellular uptake was low (0.2%). These results suggest that muffins and bread could boost the daily consumption of lutein, zeaxanthin, and ferulic acid, allowing for a small portion to be absorbed in the small intestine."

Emerging evidence has shown that ferroptosis is involved in the progression of NAFLD. Zeaxanthin (ZEA) is a carotenoid found in human serum. It has been reported that ZEA can ameliorate obesity, prevent age-related macular degeneration, and protect against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. However, no study has focused on the protective effects of ZEA against NAFLD. In this study, free fatty acid (FFA) induced HepG2 cells were used as a cell model for NAFLD. Our results suggest that ZEA exerts antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects in FFA-induced HepG2 cells. Moreover, ZEA acted as a ferroptosis inhibitor, significantly reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and iron overload and improving mitochondrial dysfunction in FFA-induced HepG2 cells. In addition, ZEA downregulated the expression of p53 and modulated downstream targets, such as GPX4, SLC7A11, SAT1, and ALOX15, which contributed to the reduction in cellular lipid peroxidation. Our findings suggest that ZEA has the potential for NAFLD intervention.",

Zeaxanthin (Zea) is a carotenoid with many beneficial effects on human health. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the combination of Zea and exercise had therapeutic effects on obesity induced by an HFD in rats. Sixty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups of twelve: rats fed a standard diet; rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD); rats fed an HFD with Zea; rats fed an HFD with Exc; and rats fed an HFD with both Zea and Exc. To induce obesity, rats were fed an HFD for twelve weeks. Then, Zea and exercise were introduced with the HFD for five weeks. The results showed that the HFD significantly increased visceral adipose tissue, oxidative stress, and inflammation biomarkers and reduced insulin, high-density lipoprotein, and antioxidant parameters. Treatments with Zea, Exc, and Zea plus Exc reduced body weight gain, triacylglycerol, glucose, total cholesterol, and nitric oxide levels and significantly increased catalase and insulin compared with the HFD group. This study demonstrated that Zea administration and Exc performance appeared to effectively alleviate the metabolic alterations induced by an HFD. Furthermore, Zea and Exc together had a better effect than either intervention alone.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Asthma is a heterogeneous and complex chronic airway disease with a high incidence rate, characterized by chronic airway inflammation. Although the anti-inflammatory effect of zeaxanthin has been demonstrated in various disease models, its explicit role in allergic asthma remains elusive. METHODS: An allergic asthma model was established by ovalbumin (OVA) stimulation in BALB/c nude mice. The pathological examination, collagen deposition and expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in lung tissues were determined by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), MASSON and immunofluorescence staining, respectively. Besides, the effect of zeaxanthin on inflammation and oxidative stress was assessed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and spectrophotometry measure. Moreover, the underlying mechanism was analyzed by detecting the expression of phosphorylated p38 (p-p38), p38, β-catenin, p-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK) and JNK with western blot assays. RESULTS: The distinct infiltration of inflammatory cells was observed in the OVA-induced asthma mice model with significantly increased concentrations of immunoglobulin E (IgE), interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, IL-13 and eotaxin (p˂0.001), which were prominently reversed by zeaxanthin treatment (p˂0.001). In addition, zeaxanthin treatment decreased the OVA-induced collagen deposition and α-SMA expression. A similar inhibitory effect of zeaxanthin on the oxidative stress was also observed in the OVA-induced asthma mice model, as evidenced by the prominent decrease of malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration and the remarkable increase of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S transferase (GST) and Glutathione (GSH) concentrations (p˂0.001). Moreover, zeaxanthin introduction markedly reduced the relative expressions of p-p38/p38, β-catenin and p-JNK/JNK in the OVA-induced asthma mice model (p˂0.001), indicating that zeaxanthin suppressed the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK)/β-catenin signaling pathway in the OVA-induced asthma mice model. CONCLUSIONS: Zeaxanthin attenuated OVA-induced allergic asthma in mice via modulating the p38 MAPK/β-catenin signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "Cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LDs), which are remarkably dynamic, neutral lipid storage organelles, play fundamental roles in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. Both the dynamic remodeling of LDs and LD-mitochondrion interactions in adipocytes are effective mechanisms to ameliorate obesity and related comorbidities. Zeaxanthin (ZEA) is a natural carotenoid and has beneficial effects on anti-obesity. However, the underlying mechanisms of ZEA on LD modulation are still unclear. In the present study, ZEA efficiently inhibited LD accumulation and attenuated adipocyte proliferation by arresting the cell cycle. ZEA drove transcriptional alterations to reprogram a lipid oxidative metabolism phenotype in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes. ZEA significantly decreased the TAG and FA content and modulated the dynamic alterations of LDs by upregulating the expression of lipases and the LD-mitochondrion contact site protein, perilipin 5 (PLIN5), and downregulating the LD fusion protein, fat-specific protein 27 (FSP27). Mechanistically, ZEA stimulated LD remodeling and ameliorated mitochondrial defects caused by large and unilocular LD accumulation by activating β3-adrenergic receptor (β3-AR) signaling. Furthermore, the knockdown of PLIN5 impaired the LD-mitochondrion interactions, thereby disrupting the role of ZEA in promoting mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and respiratory chain operation. Collectively, the present study demonstrates that ZEA induces LD structural and metabolic remodeling by activating β3-AR signaling and enhances PLIN5-mediated LD-mitochondrion interactions in hypertrophic white adipocytes, thereby enhancing oxidative capacity, and has the potential as a nutritional intervention for the prevention and treatment of obesity and associated metabolic syndrome.",

Since ZEA may play its anti-oxidative role in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), we hypothesized cognitive defects could be prevented or deferred by ZEA pre-treatment. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: All the rats were randomly divided into four groups (control, Aβ1-42, ZEA, and ZEA + Aβ groups). Learning and memory ability of rats, cerebrovascular ultrastructure changes, the redox state, endothelin-1 (ET-1) level, and amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) level in plasma and the Aβ transport receptors which are advanced glycation end products (RAGEs) and LDL receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) expressions in the cerebrovascular tissue were measured in the present study. RESULTS: The escape latency and frequency of spanning the position of platform showed significant differences between the Aβ group and ZEA treatment groups. ZEA could prevent the ultrastructure changes of cerebrovascular tissue. In addition, ZEA also showed the protective effects on regulating redox state, restraining ET-1 levels, and maintaining Aβ homeostasis in plasma and cerebrovascular. Moreover, the disordered expressions of RAGE and LRP-1 and IL-1β induced by Aβ1-42 could be prevented by the pre-treatment of ZEA. CONCLUSION: ZEA pre-treatment could prevent learning and memory impairment of rats induced by Aβ1-42. This neuroprotective effect might be attributable to the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of ZEA on maintaining the redox state and reducing the Aβ level through regulating the Aβ transport receptors and inflammatory cytokine of the cerebrovascular tissue."

      "abstract": "Low temperature combined with low light (LL) affects crop production, especially the yield and quality of peppers, in northwest China during the winter and spring seasons. Zeaxanthin (Z) is a known lipid protectant and active oxygen scavenger. However, whether exogenous Z can mitigate LL-induced inhibition of photosynthesis and oxidative stress in peppers remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of exogenous Z on photosynthesis and the antioxidant machinery of pepper seedlings subject to LL stress. The results showed that the growth and photosynthesis of pepper seedlings were significantly inhibited by LL stress. In addition, the antioxidant machinery was disturbed by the uneven production and elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which resulted in damage to the pepper. For example, membrane lipid peroxidation increased ROS content, and so on. However, exogenous application of Z before LL stress significantly increased the plant height, stem diameter, net photosynthetic rate (Pn), and stomata, which were obviously closed at LL. The activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), mono de-hydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), de-hydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and ascorbate oxidase (AAO) improved significantly due to the increased expression of CaSOD, CaCAT, CaAPX, CaMDHAR, and CaDHAR. The ascorbic (AsA) and glutathione (GSH) contents and ascorbic/dehydroascorbate (AsA/DHA) and glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratios also increased significantly, resulting in the effective removal of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide anions (O2•-) caused by LL stress. Thus, pre-treatment with Z significantly reduced ROS accumulation in pepper seedlings under LL stress by enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes and accumulation of components of the ascorbate-glutathione (AsA-GSH) cycle and upregulated key genes in the AsA-GSH cycle."

      "abstract": "Lutein and zeaxanthin belong to the xanthophyll family of carotenoids, which are pigments produced by plants. Structurally, they are very similar, differing only slightly in the arrangement of atoms. Key sources of these carotenoids include kale, savoy cabbage, spinach, broccoli, peas, parsley, corn, and egg yolks. The recommended daily intake of lutein is approximately 10.0 mg and that of zeaxanthin is 2 mg. Lutein intake in adults varies, with average intakes being 1-2 mg/day. Due to the lack of synthesis of consumption of these compounds in humans, these substances are extremely important for the proper functioning of certain organs of the body (eye, skin, heart, intestines). Eating a lot of dark leafy vegetables and some fruits can help to prevent our bodies from developing diseases. The protective effects of carotenoids are mainly related to their defense against oxidative stress and their ability to scavenge free radicals. Lutein and zeaxanthin are the only dietary carotenoids that accumulate in the retina, specifically the macula, and are called macular pigments. These carotenoids are concentrated by the action of specific binding proteins such as StARD3, which binds lutein, and GSTP1, which binds zeaxanthin and its dietary metabolite, mesozeaxanthin. It has been shown that supportive therapy with lutein and zeaxanthin can have a beneficial effect in delaying the progression of eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts. This article presents the current state of knowledge on the role of lutein and zeaxanthin, especially from human studies targeting their metabolism and bioavailability, with recommendations to consume xanthophyll-rich foods.",

Skin hydration was assessed through transepidermal water loss, and several serum biochemical parameters (collagenase, hydroxyproline, hyaluronic acid, and ceramide levels) were determined to assess the skin moisturizing activity of the product. Images for assessing photoaging were considered between different groups on day 42. All these subjective parameters reached statistical significance (P<0.05) in groups treated with the proprietary lutein and rosemary formulation compared with the placebo-treated group.

METHODS: Fifty-four subjects with high myopia were prospectively recruited for a 3-month clinical trial. Detailed ophthalmologic examinations and MPOD measurements were performed. The subjects in each high myopia category group were randomly subdivided into 5 intervention groups, including a low-dose Lycium barbarum group (10 g Lycium barbarum, containing 10 mg of zeaxanthin and 1 mg of lutein), low-dose control group (1 mg of lutein), high-dose Lycium barbarum group (20 g of Lycium barbarum, containing 20 mg of zeaxanthin and 2 mg lutein), high-dose control group (2 mg of lutein), and a blank control group. Differences in the MPODs among the high myopia groups were calculated with Welch two-sample t tests. A linear mixed-effects model was constructed and Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to determine correlations between MPOD and other factors. The MPOD values at baseline and the 3-month follow-up were compared with the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: The category 1 group had a significantly higher MPOD than the category 2 (P = 0.02) and category 3 groups (P < 0.001). The category 2 group had a significantly higher MPOD than the category 3 group (P < 0.001). The MPOD significantly decreased with increasing axial length (AL) and decreasing best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the category 1-3 groups and with increasing age and increasing intraocular pressure (IOP) in the category 2-3 groups. The MPOD was significantly higher in the group who received high-dose zeaxanthin from Lycium barbarum than in the group who received high-dose lutein at 3 months (P = 0.0403), while no significant difference was identified between the low-dose zeaxanthin group and low-dose lutein group (P = 0.1117). CONCLUSIONS: The MPOD was negatively correlated with the category of high myopia. Supplementation of zeaxanthin from Lycium barbarum is beneficial in preventing the loss of macular pigment of high myopia patients.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) characterized by neurofibrillary tangles caused by hyperphosphorylated tau is the most common cause of dementia. Zeaxanthin (Zea), derived from fruits and vegetables, may reduce the risk of AD. Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) might cause memory impairment in AD. OBJECTIVE: Here, we studied protective role of Zea on the relationship among ERS, activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β, tau phosphorylated kinase), and p-Tau (Ser 396 and Thr 231). METHODS: The results were obtained in non-RA and RA group by using different treatment, such as 9-cis-retinoic acid (RA), TM (ERS inducer), Zea, 4-PBA (ERS inhibitor), and SB216763 (GSK-3β inhibitor). The methods included flow cytometry and MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] for the detections of cell cycle and cell viability and western blot as a third measure of proteins in relation to ERS and tau phosphorylation. We have collected and analyzed all the data that suggested application of drugs for the treatment in non-RA and RA group. RESULTS: Zea displays its protection on TM-induced cell injury, upregulation of GRP78 expression, and change of GSK-3β activity and tau phosphorylation when 4-PBA and SB216763 interfere with the process. CONCLUSION: These studies indicated that Zea is in vicious circle in ERS, GSK-3β, and tau phosphorylation, and further reflect its potential value in AD.",

      "abstract": "Age-related deterioration of sensorimotor and cognitive abilities suggests that the brain undergoes regressive alterations with aging that compromise its function. Thus, the present study was designed to assess the efficacy of Dunaliella salina in counteracting D-galactose (D-gal)-induced dementia brain aging and its modulatory role in attenuating amyloid β (Aβ) protein and neurotransmitters. Aging associated dementia was generated by injection of D-gal (200 mg/kg; i.p) of rats for 8 weeks. D. salina biomass (250 mg/kg), polar (30 mg/kg), its carotenoid (30 mg/kg) fractions as well as the isolated zeaxanthin (250 μg/kg) were given orally simultaneously with D-gal for additional two weeks. Twenty-four hours after the last treatment dose; behavioral, biochemical and histopathological assessment were performed. Results showed that oral treatment of motor deficit rats with D. salina biomass and its isolated polar and carotenoid fractions showed amelioration in the motor coordination assessed by the rotarod test and in the memory and learning capabilities evaluated by Morris water maze test. D. salina also showed a reduction in brain levels of inflammatory indicators viz. interlekin-1β and inducible nitric oxide synthetase as well as brain contents of Aβ protein and myelin base protein. Likewise, oral treatment with D. salina biomass and its isolated polar and carotenoid fractions exhibited an increase in the rats' brain neurotransmitters and their metabolites. Furthermore, histopathological investigations have confirmed all of these results. Our findings suggest that D. salina overcomes brain aging and thereby repairs age-related dementia, both for its modulating function in attenuating the Aβ protein and neurotransmitters."

      "abstract": "The stimulation of fat thermogenesis and modulation of the gut microbiota are promising therapeutic strategies against obesity. Zeaxanthin (ZEA), a carotenoid plant pigment, has been shown to prevent various diseases; however, the therapeutic mechanism for obesity remains unclear. Herein, whether ZEA improves obesity by activating the β3-adrenergic receptor (β3-AR) to stimulate white adipose tissue (WAT) thermogenesis and modulating the gut microbiota was investigated. C57BL6/N mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) supplemented with ZEA for 22 weeks. ZEA treatment reduced body weight, fat weight, adipocyte hypertrophy, liver weight, and lipid deposition, and improved dyslipidaemia, serum GPT, GOT, leptin, and irisin levels, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance in HFD-fed mice. Mechanistically, ZEA treatment induced the expression of β3-AR and thermogenic factors, such as PRDM16, PGC-1α, and UCP1, in inguinal WAT (iWAT) and brown adipose tissue. ZEA treatment stimulated iWAT thermogenesis through the synergistic cooperation of key organelles, which manifested as an increased expression of lipid droplet degradation factors (ATGL, CGI-58 and pHSL), mitochondrial biogenesis factors (Sirt1, Nrf2, Tfam, Nampt and Cyt-C), peroxisomal biogenesis factors (Pex16, Pex19 and Pmp70), and β-oxidation factors (Cpt1, Cpt2, Acadm and Acox1). The thermogenic effect of ZEA was abolished by β3-AR antagonist (SR59230A) treatment. Additionally, dietary supplementation with ZEA reversed gut microbiota dysbiosis by regulating the abundance of Firmicutes, Clostridia, Proteobacteria, and Desulfovibrio, which were associated with the thermogenesis- and obesity-associated indices by Spearman's correlation analysis. Functional analysis of the gut microbiota indicated that ZEA treatment significantly enriched the lipid metabolism pathways. These results demonstrate that ZEA is a promising multi-target functional food for the treatment of obesity by activating β3-AR to stimulate iWAT thermogenesis, and modulating the gut microbiota.",

AMD has been linked to several pathological factors, such as oxidative stress and inflammation. Moreover, Aβ (1-42) oligomers have been found in drusen, the extracellular deposits that accumulate beneath the retinal pigmented epithelium in AMD patients. Hereby, we investigated the hypothesis that treatment with 1,25(OH) 2D3 (vitamin D3) and meso-zeaxathin, physiologically present in the eye, would counteract the toxic effects of three different insults on immortalized human retinal pigmented epithelial cells (ARPE-19). Specifically, ARPE-19 cells have been challenged with Aβ (1-42) oligomers, H2O2, LPS, and TNF-α, respectively. In the present study, we demonstrated that the combination of 1,25(OH)2D3 and meso-zeaxanthin significantly counteracted the cell damage induced by the three insults, at least in these in vitro integrated paradigms of AMD. These results suggest that combination of 1,25(OH)2D3 and meso-zeaxathin could be a useful approach to contrast pathological features of AMD, such as retinal inflammation and oxidative stress."

However, the in vivo bioavailability of Chlorella is still poorly evaluated. In this work, a human intervention study was conducted in 11 healthy men to evaluate the bioavailability of carotenoids within 3 days after the intake of a single dose (6 g) of dried marine Chlorella vulgaris containing lutein (7.08 mg), β-carotene (1.88 mg) and zeaxanthin (1.47 mg). Subjects were instructed to follow a low carotenoid diet during the experimental phase, starting 1 week earlier. On the day of the experiment, dried microalgae formulated in vegetarian hard capsules were ingested, and blood samples were collected up to 72 h for the analysis of plasma carotenoids concentration by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection. For all carotenoids, the estimated AUC and Cmax values were significantly different from zero (p < 0.05), indicating that a single dose of marine Chlorella vulgaris increased plasma concentrations of lutein (Cmin-corrected AUC = 1002 µg·h/L, Cmax = 20.4 µg/L), β-carotene (AUC = 1302 µg·h/L, Cmax = 34.9 µg/L) and zeaxanthin (AUC = 122.2 µg·h/L, Cmax = 3.4 µg/L). The bioavailability of other compounds, namely, polyunsaturated fatty acids and trace elements, was also assessed post-prandial for the first time, showing that linoleic acid, docosahexaenoic acid and iodine were absorbed after microalgae intake. These findings support the use of Chlorella vulgaris as a source of carotenoids, PUFA and essential trace elements with associated health benefits."

The aim of this review was to critically appraise the effect on MPOD of increasing L/Z intake by dietary intervention in adults. Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Cinahl were searched up to April 2020. Ten studies investigating populations with and without age-related macular degeneration were included. MPOD increased significantly in 2 of the 8 controlled studies. Studies varied largely in the prescribed dietary L/Z dosage, duration, and participant characteristics. No relationships between types of dietary L/Z interventions and MPOD response could be determined. Limited monitoring of habitual dietary L/Z intake was identified as a major limitation of all 10 studies. Habitual dietary L/Z intake should be closely monitored in future studies to account for their effects on MPOD response to dietary L/Z interventions.",

      "abstract": "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited photoreceptor degeneration diseases that causes blindness without effective treatment. The pathogenesis of retinal degeneration involves mainly oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Zeaxanthin dipalmitate (ZD), a wolfberry-derived carotenoid, has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress effects. Here we investigated whether these properties of ZD can delay the retinal degeneration in rd10 mice, a model of RP, and explored its underlying mechanism. One shot of ZD or control vehicle was intravitreally injected into rd10 mice on postnatal day 16 (P16). Retinal function and structure of rd10 mice were assessed at P25, when rods degenerate substantially, using a visual behavior test, multi-electrode-array recordings and immunostaining. Retinal pathogenic gene expression and regulation of signaling pathways by ZD were explored using transcriptome sequencing and western blotting. Our results showed that ZD treatment improved the visual behavior of rd10 mice and delayed the degeneration of retinal photoreceptors. It also improved the light responses of photoreceptors, bipolar cells and retinal ganglion cells. The expression of genes that are involved in inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress were up-regulated in rd10 mice, and were reduced by ZD. ZD further reduced the activation of two key factors, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2, down-regulated the expression of the inflammatory factor GFAP, and inhibited extracellular signal regulated protein kinases and P38, but not the JNK pathways. In conclusion, ZD delays the degeneration of the rd10 retina both morphologically and functionally. Its anti-inflammatory function is mediated primarily through the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 and MAPK pathways. Thus, ZD may serve as a potential clinical candidate to treat RP.",

DESIGN: Double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, the European Nutrition in Glaucoma Management Study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT04460365). PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-two participants (38 men, 24 women) with a diagnosis of open-angle glaucoma were enrolled. Forty-two were randomized to receive the active supplement, 20 participants were allocated to placebo. METHODS: Macular pigment optical density (MPOD) was measured by autofluorescence using the Heidelberg Spectralis scanning laser ophthalmoscope. Macular pigment optical density volume within the central 6° of retinal eccentricity as well as MPOD at 0.23°, 0.51°, 0.74°, and 1.02° were recorded at baseline and at 6-month intervals over 18 months. Visual function was assessed using visual acuity, mesopic and photopic contrast sensitivity under glare conditions, photo stress recovery time, microperimetry, and Glaucoma Activities Limitation 9 questionnaire. Advanced glaucoma module scans of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and ganglion cell complex thickness over the central 6° of retinal eccentricity also were completed at each study visit. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in MPOD after supplementation with 10 mg lutein, 2 mg zeaxanthin, and 10 mg meso-zeaxanthin or placebo over 18 months. RESULTS: A mixed-model repeated measures analysis of variance revealed a statistically significant increase in MPOD volume (significant time effect: F(3,111) = 89.31, mean square error (MSE) = 1656.9; P < 0.01). Post hoc t tests revealed a significant difference in MPOD volume at each study visit for the treatment group (P < 0.01 for all), but no change in the placebo group (P > 0.05 for all). A statistically significant increase in mesopic contrast sensitivity under glare conditions was noted at 18 months in the treatment group, but not placebo. No other structural or functional changes were observed. No serious adverse events were noted during the trial. CONCLUSIONS: Macular pigment can be augmented in glaucomatous eyes by supplementation with a formulation containing the carotenoids lutein, zeaxanthin, and meso-zeaxanthin. The greatest relative benefit was observed in those with the lowest baseline levels, but increases were noted across all participants and each retinal eccentricity. The potential benefits of MP augmentation for macular health in glaucoma merit further long-term evaluation."

      "abstract": "Previous studies revealed that oxidative stress and inflammation are the main contributors to secondary injury after traumatic brain injury (TBI). In an earlier study, we reported that lutein/zeaxanthin isomers (L/Zi) exert antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects by activating the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathways. However, its precise role and underlying mechanisms were largely unknown after TBI. This study was conducted to investigate the potential mechanism of L/Zi isomers in a TBI model induced by a cold injury model in mice. To investigate the effects of L/Zi, male C57BL/6j mice-induced brain injury using the cold trauma model was allocated into two groups (n = 7): (i) TBI + vehicle group and (ii) TBI + L/Zi group (20 mg/kg BW). Brain samples were collected 24 h later for analyses. L/Zi given immediately after the injury decreased infarct volume and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability; L/Zi treatment also significantly reduced proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and NF-κB levels and increased growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and Nrf2 levels compared with vehicle control. These data suggest that L/Zi improves mitochondrial function in TBI models, possibly decreasing inflammation and activating the Nrf2 pathway.",

Zeaxanthin (ZEA) is a kind of carotenoid with potent antioxidant activity and has been reported to promote mitochondrial biogenesis. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism has not been explained. In this study, we first discovered that ZEA stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocyte browning by increasing the expression of specific markers (Cd137, Tbx1, Sirt1, Cidea, Ucp1, Tmem26, and Cited1), thereby reducing lipid accumulation. Besides, ZEA promoted mitochondrial biogenesis by increasing the expression of PRDM16, UCP1, NRF2, PGC-1α, and SIRT1. Moreover, the uncoupled oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of protons leaked in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was rapidly increased by ZEA treatment, which improved mitochondrial respiration and energy metabolism. Furthermore, we found that ZEA promotes browning by enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis partly through the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. This study provided new insight into the promotion of browning and mitochondrial biogenesis by ZEA, suggesting that ZEA probably has potential therapeutic effects on obesity.",

The results indicated that the pretreatment with zeaxanthin effectively alleviated chilling damage in pepper leaves and increased the plant fresh weight and photosynthetic pigment content under chilling stress. Additionally, alterations in photosynthetic chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and chlorophyll fluorescence induction curves after zeaxanthin treatment highlighted the participation of zeaxanthin in improving the photosystem response to chilling stress by heightening the quenching of excess excitation energy and protection of the photosynthetic electron transport system. In chill-stressed plants, zeaxanthin treatment also enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity and transcript expression, and reduced hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide anion (O2•-) content, resulting in a decrease in biological membrane damage. Additionally, exogenous zeaxanthin upregulated the expression levels of key genes encoding β-carotene hydroxylase (CaCA1, CaCA2), zeaxanthin epoxidase (CaZEP) and violaxanthin de-epoxidase (CaVDE), and promoted the synthesis of endogenous zeaxanthin during chilling stress. Collectively, exogenous zeaxanthin pretreatment enhances plant tolerance to chilling by improving the photosystem process, increasing oxidation resistance, and inducing alterations in endogenous zeaxanthin metabolism.",

      "abstract": "Stress-induced gastritis is a common problem in the intensive care unit. Zeaxanthin (ZE), a non-provitamin A carotenoid has been known to exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we examined the effect of ZE on water avoidance stress (WAS)-induced gastritis in rats. 24 Sprague' Dawley male rats were divided into four groups; control, ZE, WAS and WAS+ZE. In the stressed rats, treatment with ZE effectively downregulated the gastric levels of total oxidant status (TOS), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and malondialdehyde (MDA), with significant upregulation of the antioxidant enzymes' activities and gastric levels of prostagladin-E2 (PGE2) as compared to the untreated stressed one. As noticed in the present study, ZE significantly decrease the gastric levels of interleukin-1 β (IL-1β) and IL-6 as well as suppression of nuclear transcription factor kappa-B (NF-κB) immunohistochemical expression together with upregulation of trefoil factor-1 (TFF-1) gene expression. Moreover, in the untreated WAS-induced gastritis group, gastrin and corticosterone levels were significantly increased together with upregulation of the gene expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), PI3K, Akt and JNK in the gastric tissues, which significantly improved by ZE administration. These all positive effects of ZE reflected on reduction of microscopic gastric mucosal damage and inflammatory cell infiltration with improvement of ulcer score. Our results discover that ZE has a new gastroprotective effect against stress-induced gastritis in rats, primarily through its antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects, which are expressed in the regulation of the MMP-9 and HIF-1α signaling pathways.",

In order to elucidate some novel insights of Lycium barbarum (Goji berry) activity on skin cells, the present study focused on its active compound zeaxanthin. By targeting the stemness markers CD44 and CD105, with deep implications in skin oxidative stress mechanisms, we revealed, for the first time, selectivity in zeaxanthin activity. When applied in vitro on BJ human fibroblast cell line versus the A375 malignant melanoma cells, despite the moderate cytotoxicity, the zeaxanthin-rich extracts 1 and 2 were able to downregulate significantly the CD44 and CD105 membrane expression and extracellular secretion in A375, and to upregulate them in BJ cells. At mechanistic level, the present study is the first to demonstrate that the zeaxanthin-rich Goji extracts are able to influence selectively the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK): ERK, JNK and p38 in normal BJ versus tumor-derived A375 skin cells. These results point out towards the applications of zeaxanthin from L. barbarum as a cytoprotective agent in normal skin and raises questions about its use as an antitumor prodrug alone or in combination with standard therapy.",

Because zeaxanthin helps to prevent age-related macular degeneration, its commercial use in personalized nutritional and pharmaceutical applications has expanded. To meet the quantitative requirements for personalized treatment and pharmaceutical applications, it is necessary to produce highly purified zeaxanthin. RESULTS: In this study, to meet the quantitative requirements for industrial applications, we generated a double knockout mutant which is gene-edited by the CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein-mediated knock-in system. The lycopene epsilon cyclase (LCYE) was edited to the elimination of α-branch of xanthophyll biosynthesis in a knockout mutant of the zeaxanthin epoxidase gene (ZEP). The double knockout mutant (dzl) had a 60% higher zeaxanthin yield (5.24 mg L- 1) and content (7.28 mg g- 1) than that of the parental line after 3 days of cultivation. Furthermore, medium optimization improved the 3-day yield of zeaxanthin from the dzl mutant to 6.84 mg L- 1. CONCLUSIONS: A Chlamydomonas strain with the elimination of lutein production by gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 has been successfully developed. This research presents a solution to overcome the difficulties of the downstream-process for the production of high-purity zeaxanthin.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Zeaxanthin, a carotenoid commonly found in plants, has a variety of biological functions including anti-cancer activity. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the potential mechanisms of zeaxanthin in human gastric cancer cells. METHODS: CCK-8 assay was used to examine the cytotoxic effect of zeaxanthin on human gastric cancer cells. Flow cytometry was used to analyse AGS cell cycle distribution and apoptosis status. Western blot analysis was used to detect the expression levels of cycle-related proteins (Cyclin A, Cyclin B1, CDK1/2, p21, and p27), apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2, Bad, caspase-3, PARP), MAPK, AKT, STAT3, and NF-κB. RESULTS: CCK-8 assay showed that zeaxanthin has obvious cytotoxic effects on 12 types of human gastric cancer cells, but no obvious toxic effect on normal cells. In addition, flow cytometry and Western blotting results showed that zeaxanthin induces apoptosis by reducing mitochondrial membrane potential; increasing Cytochrome C, Bax, cleaved-caspase-3 (cle-cas-3), and cleaved-PARP (cle-PARP) expression levels; and decreasing Bcl-2, pro-caspase-3 (pro-cas-3), and pro-PARP expression levels. Additionally, zeaxanthin caused cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase by increasing the levels of p21 and p27 and reduced the levels of AKT, Cyclin A, Cyclin B1, and Cyclin-dependent kinase 1/2 (CDK1/2). Furthermore, after zeaxanthin treatment, the expression levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), p-JNK, p-p38, and I-κB increased, and the expression levels of p-ERK, p-AKT, STAT3, and NF-κB decreased. However, the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and MAPK inhibitors inhibited zeaxanthin-induced apoptosis, and under the action of zeaxanthin, MAPK regulated NF-κB and STAT3, and reduced their protein expression levels. CONCLUSION: Zeaxanthin has a potential effect against gastric cancer cells through the ROS-mediated MAPK, AKT, NF-κB, and STAT3 signaling pathways, and it is expected to become a new drug for the treatment of human gastric cancer."

      "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (DR) are two of the most common and severe causes of vision loss in the population. Both conditions are associated with excessive levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the eye which results in an increase in the formation of new blood vessels through a process called neovascularisation. As such, anti-VEGF therapies are currently utilised as a treatment for patients with AMD however they are associated with painful administration of injections and potential degeneration of healthy endothelium. There is therefore growing interest in alternate treatment options to reduce neovascularisation in the eye. The use of carotenoids, lutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z), has been shown to improve vision loss parameters in patients with AMD, however the underlying mechanisms are not well-understood. We studied the impact of these compounds on neovascularisation processes using an in vitro cell model of the retinal microvascular endothelium. Our findings show that L and Z reduced VEGF-induced tube formation whilst, in combination (5:1 ratio), the compounds significantly blocked VEGF-induced neovascularisation. The carotenoids, individually and in combination, reduced VEGF-induced oxidative stress concomitant with increased activity of the NADPH oxidase, Nox4. We further demonstrated that the Nox4 inhibitor, GLX7013114, attenuated the protective effect of L and Z. Taken together, these findings indicate the protective effect of the carotenoids, L and Z, in reducing VEGF-mediated neovascularisation via a Nox4-dependent pathway. These studies implicate the potential for these compounds to be used as a therapeutic approach for patients suffering from AMD and proliferative DR.",

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and carotenoids are rich in retinal cells, and under oxidative stress leads to oxidation and release lipid mediators. We evaluated the impact of carotenoids (lutein, zeaxanthin) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation on RPE cells under oxidative stress. ARPE-19 cells were exposed to H2O2 after pre-treatment with lutein, zeaxanthin, DHA, lutein + zeaxanthin or lutein + zeaxanthin with DHA. The data showed H2O2 reduced cell viability and DHA content, while promoted catalase activity and certain oxidized PUFA products. Treatment with DHA enhanced omega-3 PUFA enzymatic oxidation namely, anti-inflammatory mediators such as hydroxy-DHA, resolvins and neuroprotection compared to control; the effects were not influenced by the carotenoids. Omega-6 PUFA oxidation, namely pro-inflammatory HETE (5-, 9-, 12 and 20-HETE), and isoprostanes (5- and 15-F2t-IsoP and 4-F3t-IsoP) were reduced by lutein + zeaxanthin while the addition of DHA did not further reduce these effects. We observed transcriptional regulation of 5-lipoxygenase by DHA and GPx1 and NEFEL2 by the carotenoids that potentially resulted in decreased HETEs and glutathione respectively. 4-HNE was not affected by the treatments but 4-HHE was reduced by lutein + zeaxanthin with and without DHA. To conclude, carotenoids and DHA appeared to regulate inflammatory lipid mediators while the carotenoids also showed benefits in reducing non-enzymatic oxidation of omega-6 PUFA.",

      "abstract": "Reef-building corals form a complex consortium with photosynthetic algae in the family Symbiodiniaceae and bacteria, collectively termed the coral holobiont. These bacteria are hypothesized to be involved in the stress resistance of the coral holobiont, but their functional roles remain largely elusive. Here, we show that cultured Symbiodiniaceae algae isolated from the reef-building coral Galaxea fascicularis are associated with novel bacteria affiliated with the family Flavobacteriaceae Antibiotic treatment eliminated the bacteria from cultured Symbiodiniaceae, resulting in a decreased maximum quantum yield of PSII (variable fluorescence divided by maximum fluorescence [Fv/Fm]) and an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under thermal and light stresses. We then isolated this bacterial strain, named GF1. GF1 inoculation in the antibiotic-treated Symbiodiniaceae cultures restored the Fv/Fm and reduced the ROS production. Furthermore, we found that GF1 produces the carotenoid zeaxanthin, which possesses potent antioxidant activity. Zeaxanthin supplementation to cultured Symbiodiniaceae ameliorated the Fv/Fm and ROS production, suggesting that GF1 mitigates thermal and light stresses in cultured Symbiodiniaceae via zeaxanthin production. These findings could advance our understanding of the roles of bacteria in Symbiodiniaceae and the coral holobiont, thereby contributing to the development of novel approaches toward coral protection through the use of symbiotic bacteria and their metabolites.IMPORTANCE Occupying less than 1% of the seas, coral reefs are estimated to harbor ∼25% of all marine species. However, the destruction of coral reefs has intensified in the face of global climate changes, such as rising seawater temperatures, which induce the overproduction of reactive oxygen species harmful to corals. Although reef-building corals form complex consortia with bacteria and photosynthetic endosymbiotic algae of the family Symbiodiniaceae, the functional roles of coral-associated bacteria remain largely elusive. By manipulating the Symbiodiniaceae bacterial community, we demonstrated that a bacterium that produces an antioxidant carotenoid could mitigate thermal and light stresses in cultured Symbiodiniaceae isolated from a reef-building coral. Therefore, this study illuminates the unexplored roles of coral-associated bacteria under stressful conditions.",

Some conditions, such as chronic hepatitis B virus, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, remain incurable. Managing them can constitute an economic burden for patients and healthcare systems. Hence, development of more effective pharmacological drugs is warranted. Studies have shown the hepatoprotective, antifibrotic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, antitumor, and chemopreventive properties of ZD.

DESIGN: Post hoc analysis of a randomized trial. PARTICIPANTS: White AREDS2 participants. METHODS: AREDS2 participants (n = 4203) with bilateral large drusen or late AMD in 1 eye were assigned randomly to lutein and zeaxanthin, omega-3 fatty acids, both, or placebo, and most also received the AREDS supplements. A secondary randomization assessed modified AREDS supplements in 4 treatment arms: lower zinc dosage, omission of β-carotene, both, or no modification. To evaluate the progression to late AMD, fundus photographs were obtained at baseline and annual study visits, and history of treatment for late AMD was obtained at study visits and 6-month interim telephone calls. Participants were genotyped for the single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs1061170 in CFH and rs10490924 in ARMS2. Bivariate frailty models using both eyes were conducted, including a gene-supplement interaction term and adjusting for age, gender, level of education, and smoking status. The main treatment effects, as well as the direct comparison between lutein plus zeaxanthin and β-carotene, were assessed for genotype interaction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The interaction between genotype and the response to AREDS2 supplements regarding progression to late AMD, any geographic atrophy (GA), and neovascular AMD. RESULTS: Complete data were available for 2775 eyes without baseline late AMD (1684 participants). The participants (mean age ± standard deviation, 72.1±7.7 years; 58.5% female) were followed up for a median of 5 years. The ARMS2 risk allele was associated significantly with progression to late AMD and neovascular AMD (P = 2.40 × 10-5 and P = 0.002, respectively), but not any GA (P = 0.097). The CFH risk allele was not associated with AMD progression. Genotype did not modify significantly the response to any of the AREDS2 supplements. CONCLUSIONS: CFH and ARMS2 risk alleles do not modify the response to the AREDS2 nutrient supplements with respect to the progression to late AMD (GA and neovascular AMD).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Retina photoreceptor cells are specially adapted for functioning over comprehensive ambient light conditions. Lutein and Zeaxanthin isomers (L/Zi) can protect photoreceptor cells against excessive light degeneration. Efficacy of L/Zi has been assessed on some G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), transcription and neurotrophic factors in the retina of rats exposed to incremental intense light emitting diode (LED) illumination conditions. METHODS: Forty-two male rats (age: 8 weeks) were randomly assigned to six treatment groups, 7 rats each. The rats with a 3x2 factorial design were kept under 3 intense light conditions (12hL/12hD, 16hL/8hD, 24hL/0hD) and received two levels of L/Zi (0 or 100 mg/kg BW) for two months. Increased nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), and decreased Rhodopsin (Rho), Rod arrestin (Sag), G Protein Subunit Alpha Transducin1 (Gnat1), neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), growth-associated protein-43 (GAP43), nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) were observed in 24 h light intensity adaptation followed by 16 h IL and 8 h D. RESULTS: L/Zi administration significantly improved antioxidant capacity and retinal Rho, Rod-arrestin (Sag), Gnat1, NCAM, GAP43, BDNF, NGF, IGF1, Nrf2, and HO-1 levels. However, the levels of NF-κB and GFAP levels were decreased by administration of L/Zi. CONCLUSIONS: According to these results, L/Zi may be assumed as an adjunct therapy to prevent early photoreceptor cell degeneration and neutralize free radicals derived from oxidative stress.",

      "abstract": "Zeaxanthin (ZEA), a type of oxygenated carotenoid with strong antioxidant activity, has previously been found to exhibit an anti-lipogenesis effect. In the present study, we investigated the effect of ZEA on brown-like adipocyte formation and mitochondrial biogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Brown adipocyte-specific markers, mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative stress, and the involvement of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) α1 were assessed. ZEA treated adipocytes demonstrated a brown-like pattern, with upregulated expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and other brown adipocyte markers. In addition, ZEA intervention induced a dramatic increase in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content and in the mRNA levels of genes associated with mitochondrial biogenesis. Furthermore, ZEA attenuated mitochondrial oxidative damage caused by lipid peroxidation in adipocytes, significantly improved the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and scavenged intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial superoxide. Finally, we concluded that AMPKα1 mediated the ZEA-caused inhibition of lipid accumulation and promotion of brown and beige adipocyte-biomarker expression, as the positive effects of ZEA were diminished by Prkaa1 (AMPKα1) knockdown. These findings demonstrated that ZEA promoted the expression of brown and beige adipogenesis markers and mitochondrial biogenesis, which involved AMPKα1 activation, thus contributing to the anti-obesity effects of ZEA.",

      "abstract": "SCOPE: Besides abstinence and nutritional support, there is no proven clinical treatment for patients with alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD). Here, the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of action of wolfberry-derived zeaxanthin dipalmitate (ZD) on AFLD models are demonstrated. METHODS AND RESULTS: The hepatoprotective effects of ZD are evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Direct interacting receptors of ZD on cell membranes are identified by liver-specific knockdown and biophysical measurements. Downstream signaling pathways are delineated using molecular and cellular biological methods. It is demonstrated that ZD attenuates hepatocyte and whole-liver injury in ethanol-treated cells (dose: 1 µm) and a chronic binge AFLD rat model (dose: 10 mg kg-1 ), respectively. The direct targets of ZD on the cell membrane include receptor P2X7 and adiponectin receptor 1 (adipoR1). Signals from P2X7 and adipoR1 modulate the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase-Akt and/or AMP-activated protein kinase-FoxO3a pathways, to restore mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) functions suppressed by ethanol intoxication. In addition, ZD alleviates hepatic inflammation partially via the inhibition of Nod-like receptor 3 inflammasome, whose activation is a direct consequence of suppressed mitophagy. Liver-specific inhibition of receptors or mitophagy significantly impairs the beneficial effects of ZD. CONCLUSIONS: ZD is an effective and promising agent for the potential treatment of AFLD.",

      "abstract": "The carotenoids lutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z) accumulate in retinal regions of the eye and have long been shown to benefit visual health. A growing literature suggests cognitive benefits as well, particularly in older adults. The present randomized controlled trial sought to investigate the effects of L and Z on brain function using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). It was hypothesized that L and Z supplementation would (1) improve intra-network integrity of default mode network (DMN) and (2) reduce inter-network connectivity between DMN and other resting state networks. 48 community-dwelling older adults (mean age = 72 years) were randomly assigned to receive a daily L (10 mg) and Z (2 mg) supplement or a placebo for 1 year. Resting state fMRI data were acquired at baseline and post-intervention. A dictionary learning and sparse coding computational framework, based on machine learning principles, was used to investigate intervention-related changes in functional connectivity. DMN integrity was evaluated by calculating spatial overlap rate with a well-established DMN template provided in the neuroscience literature. Inter-network connectivity was evaluated via time series correlations between DMN and nine other resting state networks. Contrary to expectation, results indicated that L and Z significantly increased rather than decreased inter-network connectivity (Cohen's d = 0.89). A significant intra-network effect on DMN integrity was not observed. Rather than restoring what has been described in the available literature as a \"youth-like\" pattern of intrinsic brain activity, L and Z may facilitate the aging brain's capacity for compensation by enhancing integration between networks that tend to be functionally segregated earlier in the lifespan.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Lutein, RR-zeaxanthin, and RS-zeaxanthin (L-Z) are antioxidants which can reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and oxidative stress (OS), and ameliorate neurodegenerative diseases. However, their treatment effect in the Pde6b rd10 (rd10) mouse model of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and the underlying cellular mechanisms have not been studied. ERS is an important factor which causes photoreceptor apoptosis. The aim of the current project is to test the treatment effect of L-Z in rd10 mice and to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of ERS. METHODS: L-Z (Lutemax 2020, 10 mg/kg) diluted in sunflower oil (SFO, 1 mg/ml) or the same volume of SFO was administrated via gavage from postnatal day 6 (P6) to P20 daily in L-Z group (n=5) or SFO group (n=6) of rd10 mice. At P21, electroretinography (ERG) was performed to show the functional change of retinas. 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) and endoplasmic reticulum protein 29 (ERp29) were tested by western blot and immunostaining. RESULTS: The ERG amplitudes were larger in the L-Z group than those of the SFO group in all flash luminances of dark-adapted and light-adapted ERG (all p < 0.01). Western blot revealed that GRP78 in the retinas of the L-Z group was significantly downregulated compared to that of the SFO group (p < 0.01). Meanwhile, the retinal ERp29 protein was significantly upregulated in the L-Z treatment group than that of the SFO group (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: L-Z provide protection to the photoreceptors of rd10 mouse model of RP, which is probably associated with the reduction of ERS.",

Zeaxanthin is a nutritional carotenoid that belongs to the xanthophyll family of pigments. It exerts potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of zeaxanthin on acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis in rats. Rats were randomly categorized into five groups: control, zeaxanthin, acetic acid, acetic acid + zeaxanthin, and acetic acid + prednisolone groups. Zeaxanthin (50 mg/kg/day) or prednisolone (5 mg/kg/day) was orally administered for 14 days before induction of ulcerative colitis. On the 15th day, colitis was induced by transrectal administration of 3% acetic acid. The rats were sacrificed 24 h after rectal instillation and their colon tissues were examined. Pretreatment with zeaxanthin significantly reduced disease activity index, wet colon weight, ulcer area, macroscopic scores, and histological changes. Zeaxanthin also effectively downregulated the levels of myeloperoxidase and malondialdehyde, upregulated the enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase, and raised glutathione levels. With regard to anti-inflammatory mechanisms, zeaxanthin suppressed tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, interleukin-6, interleukin-1 beta, and nuclear transcription factor kappa B levels, and inhibited nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 protein expression. Our results indicate that oral administration of zeaxanthin ameliorates acetic acid-induced colitis in rats via antioxidative effects and modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine and mediator activity. Therefore, zeaxanthin may be an effective therapeutic candidate for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.",

METHODS: Forty-two male 8-week-old Wistar rats exposed to 12L/12D, 16L/8D and 24L/0D hours of intense light conditions were orally administrated either 0 or 100 mg/kg BW of zeaxanthin concentration.

RESULTS: OMX treatment significantly increased the serum zeaxanthin concentration (p < 0.001) and ameliorated oxidative damage by increasing the antioxidant enzyme activities in the retina induced by light (p < 0.001). OMX administration significantly upregulated the expression of genes, including Rhodopsin (Rho), Rod arrestin (SAG), Gα Transducin 1 (GNAT-1), neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), nuclear factor-(erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase (HO-1) and decreased the expression of nuclear factor-κB (NF- κB) and GFAP by OMX treatment rats.

Pre-illuminated chyb transgenics showed higher photosynthesis (NPQ capacity and F v / F m ratio of chyb transformants about 50% more than the controls). In addition, the transgenic plants showed less lipid peroxidation (MDA level was reduced about 40%) and the SOD activity was about 1.5 times of the control plants.

To our knowledge, maize BCX bioavailability has not been assessed in humans. Serum retinol 13C content and xanthophyll concentrations are proposed effectiveness biomarkers for biofortified maize adoption. OBJECTIVE: We determined the relative difference in BCX and zeaxanthin bioavailability from whole-grain and refined BCX-biofortified maize during chronic feeding compared with white maize and evaluated short-term changes in 13C-abundance in serum retinol. DESIGN: After a 7-d washout, 9 adults (mean ± SD age: 23.4 ± 2.3 y; 5 men) were provided with muffins made from BCX-enhanced whole-grain orange maize (WGOM), refined orange maize (ROM), or refined white maize (RWM) for 12 d in a randomized, blinded, crossover study followed by a 7-d washout. Blood was drawn on days 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 19. Carotenoid areas under the curve (AUCs) were compared by using a fixed-effects model. 13C-Abundance in serum retinol was determined by using gas chromatography/combustion/isotope-ratio mass spectrometry on days 0, 12, and 19. Vitamin A status was determined by 13C-retinol isotope dilution postintervention. RESULTS: The serum BCX AUC was significantly higher for WGOM (1.70 ± 0.63 μmol ⋅ L-1 ⋅ d) and ROM (1.66 ± 1.08 μmol ⋅ L-1 ⋅ d) than for RWM (-0.06 ± 0.13 μmol ⋅ L-1 ⋅ d; P < 0.003). A greater increase occurred in serum BCX from WGOM muffins (131%) than from ROM muffins (108%) (P ≤ 0.003). Zeaxanthin AUCs were higher for WGOM (0.94 ± 0.33) and ROM (0.96 ± 0.47) than for RWM (0.05 ± 0.12 μmol ⋅ L-1 ⋅ d; P < 0.003). The intervention did not affect predose serum retinol 13C-abundance. Vitamin A status was within an optimal range (defined as 0.1-0.7 μmol/g liver). CONCLUSIONS: BCX and zeaxanthin were highly bioavailable from BCX-biofortified maize. The adoption of BCX maize could positively affect consumers' BCX and zeaxanthin intakes and associated health benefits. This trial is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02800408.",

      "abstract": "AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of Goji berry supplementation on improving macular pigment, serum zeaxanthin levels and visual acuity in patients with early age-related macular degeneration (AMD). METHODS: A total of 114 patients (aged from 51 to 92y, mean age 69.53±8.41y) with early AMD were enrolled in our prospective, randomized controlled study. The included patients were assigned randomly to the Goji group (n=57) with 25 g of Goji berries supplementation per day for 90d and the control group (n=57) with their normal diet for 90d. Macular pigment optical density (MPOD) was measured using heterochromatic flicker photometry (HFP). The levels of serum lutein (L)/zeaxanthin (Z) were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). MPOD, serum L/Z levels and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were recorded at baseline and 90d. RESULTS: In the Goji group, there were no statistically significant differences in the serum L levels between the baseline (0.199±0.149 µmol/mL) and 90d (0.203±0.181 µmol/mL) (t=-0.186, P=0.850); however the serum Z levels were increased at 90d (0.101±0.087 µmol/mL) compared with those at the baseline (0.029±0.032 µmol/mL) (t=6.412, P<0.001). Patients treated with Goji berry for 90d showed an elevated MPOD (0.877±0.202 DU) from the baseline (0.731±0.205 DU) (t=-4.741, P=0.000). In contrast to the control group, the serum Z levels and MPOD were higher in the Goji group at 90d (both P<0.05). At 90d, patients with Goji berry supplementation had a relative decrease in BCVA (0.21±0.18 logMAR) compared with the baseline (0.27±0.20) (t=2.397, P=0.020). CONCLUSION: Overall, daily supplementation with Goji berry for 90d improves MPOD by increasing serum Z levels rather than serum L levels in early AMD patients. Goji berry may be an effective therapeutic intervention for preventing the progression of early AMD."

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress (OS) and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) are the major factors underlying photoreceptor degeneration. Lutein, RR-zeaxanthin (3R,3&rsquo;R-zeaxanthin) and RS (meso)-zeaxanthin (3R,3&rsquo;S-RS- zeaxanthin) (L/Zi) could protect against cell damage by ameliorating OS in retina. In this study, we examined the effect of L/Zi supplementation in a mouse model of photoreceptor degeneration and investigated whether the treatment of L/Zi ameliorated OS and ERS. BALB/cJ mice after light exposure were used as the animal model. The protective effects of L/Zi were observed by electroretinography (ERG) and terminal deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) analysis. The underlying mechanisms related to OS and ERS were explored by Western blotting. After L/Zi treatment, the ERG amplitudes were significantly higher, and the number of TUNEL-positive cells was significantly reduced compared to that of the vehicle group. Western blotting results revealed that OS was ameliorated according to the significant downregulation of phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK), and significant upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). In addition, ERS was reduced according to the significant downregulation of 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), phosphorylated protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (p-PERK), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and activating transcription factor (ATF6). Our data shows that L/Zi provided functional and morphological preservation of photoreceptors against light damage, which is probably related to its mitigation of oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Human eye is constantly exposed to different wavelengths and intensities of light. Oxidative stress results in distinct changes to retinal organs and tissues. Macular pigments (lutein and zeaxanthin), present in the central macular region, provide protection from photodamages by absorption of high energy blue light and also by virtue of their anti-oxidant activity. Ocular phototoxicity is thus prevented by our efficient anti-oxidant system, in both young and old. One of the best commercial sources of pure lutein and zeaxanthin is Marigold flowers. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, oil-soluble dietary carotenoid supplement constituting lutein and zeaxanthin in the ratio of 10:1 was evaluated for its modulatory effect on anti-oxidant enzymes and macular pigments in the serum and macula of the Swiss albino rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Swiss albino rats were treated with carotenoid supplement constituting lutein and trans-Zeaxanthin (10:1) at two different doses daily, under standard experimental conditions for 42 days. End of the treatment, serum and macula were collected and used for measurement of lutein and zeaxanthin levels along with anti-oxidant parameters. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Statistical differences were assessed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnet's test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All the results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. RESULTS: The supplement exhibited significant elevation of anti-oxidant enzyme levels in treated animals in dose-dependent manner. Concomitantly, the total anti-oxidant capacity has also been found to show similar increment at the end of the study period. This study revealed significant expression of the two macular pigments investigated. CONCLUSIONS: Our study, therefore, provides a strong claim for the anti-oxidant effect of the oil-soluble dietary carotenoid supplement, and thus substantiates its use in the prevention of phototoxic damage to the eye on long-term supplementation. SUMMARY: Apart from its ornamental value, Marigold (Tagetes erecta L.) flowers are well known as an herbal remedy due to its antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant activities. Epidemiological studies have implicated prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiations & blue light and in turn oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of the majority of the eye diseases, since childhood. Studies have shown that with age a number of changes occur predisposing the retinal various organs and tissues to oxidative stress. These changes manifest in decreased levels in plasma of Vitamin C, Vitamin E, glutathione, Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE), Catalase (CAT), Super Oxide Dismutase (SOD), Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substance (TBARS), and total anti-oxidant capacity (TAC). Age- and diet-related loss of Lutein and Zeaxanthin enhance phototoxic damage to the eye, and thus supplementation of these carotenoids becomes vital for maintaining optimal eye healthIn the present study, XanMax® 2002 oil, a supplement constituting lutein and trans-Zeaxanthin, extracted from the flowers of T. erecta, was evaluated for its modulatory effect on anti-oxidant enzymes and macular pigments in the serum and macula of the Swiss albino rats. XanMax® 2002 oil exhibited significant elevation of anti-oxidant enzyme levels in treated animals in dose-dependent manner. Concomitantly, the TAC has also been found to show similar increment at the end of the study period. This study revealed significant expression of the two macular pigments investigated.

Dietary carotenoids have shown beneficial health effects throughout the life cycle due to their potential antioxidant properties, their ability to serves as precursors of vitamin A and to the emerging signaling functions of their metabolites. The non-provitamin A carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin are emerging as important modulators of infant and child visual and cognitive development, as well as critical effectors in the prevention and treatment of morbidity associated with premature births. This review provides a general overview of lutein and zeaxanthin metabolism in mammalian tissues and highlights the major advancements and remaining gaps in knowledge in regards to their metabolism and health effects during pre- and early post-natal development. Furthering our knowledge in this area of research will impact dietary recommendation and supplementation strategies aimed at sustaining proper fetal and infant growth.",

The food proposed by the applicant as the subject of the health claim is NWT-02. NWT-02 is standardised by its content in lutein (≥ 1.10 mg), zeaxanthin (≥ 0.20 mg) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (≥ 170 mg). The Panel considers that the food/constituent that is the subject of the health claim, NWT-02, a fixed combination of lutein, zeaxanthin and docosahexaenoic acid in egg yolk, is sufficiently characterised. The claimed effect proposed by the applicant is 'reduces loss of vision'. The target population proposed by the applicant is 'healthy adults over 50 years of age'. The Panel considers that a reduction of the loss of vision is a beneficial physiological effect. The applicant provided two human intervention studies for the scientific substantiation of the claim. The Panel considers that the only study from which conclusions can be drawn for the scientific substantiation of the claim did not show an effect of NWT-02 on vision. The Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has not been established between the consumption of NWT-02, a fixed combination of lutein, zeaxanthin and docosahexaenoic acid in egg yolk, and a reduction of the loss of vision."

However, the underlying mechanism and effective treatment method of these diabetes-associated behavior disorders remain to be determined. In the present study, we attempted to illuminate the implication of zeaxanthin in anxiety, depression and neuroinflammation caused by hyperglycemia, and further elaborate the relevant mechanism under these neuropsychiatric disorders. In the current work, diabetic rats were induced by high glucose and fat diet followed by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozocin, and zeaxanthin was orally administration every day (From 6th to 19th week). Diabetes-associated anxiety and depression were assessed using open field test (OFT) and Forced swimming test (FST) respectively. Moreover, the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in hippocampus were tested using ELISA and WB. Data showed that long-term zeaxanthin treatment improve diabetic symptoms and alleviate anxiety and depression in diabetic rats. Furthermore, excessive production of IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α could be reduced with zeaxanthin treatment. In conclusion, we suggested that zeaxanthin can ameliorate diabetes-associated anxiety and depression, inhibit inflammation in diabetic rats. Our results could provide a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of abnormal behavior induced by hyperglycemia.",

Very few studies have addressed the issue of xanthophylls and cognitive function in younger adults, and no controlled trials have been conducted to date to determine whether or not supplementation with L + Z can change cognitive function in this population. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not supplementation with L + Z could improve cognitive function in young (age 18-30), healthy adults. Design: A randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial design was used. Fifty-one young, healthy subjects were recruited as part of a larger study on xanthophylls and cognitive function. Subjects were randomized into active supplement (n = 37) and placebo groups (n = 14). MPOD was measured psychophysically using customized heterochromatic flicker photometry. Cognitive function was measured using the CNS Vital Signs testing platform. MPOD and cognitive function were measured every four months for a full year of supplementation. Results: Supplementation increased MPOD significantly over the course of the year, vs. placebo (p < 0.001). Daily supplementation with L + Z and increases in MPOD resulted in significant improvements in spatial memory (p < 0.04), reasoning ability (p < 0.05) and complex attention (p < 0.04), above and beyond improvements due to practice effects. Conclusions: Supplementation with L + Z improves CNS xanthophyll levels and cognitive function in young, healthy adults. Magnitudes of effects are similar to previous work reporting correlations between MPOD and cognition in other populations.",

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the efficiency of dietary supplementation containing lutein, zeaxanthin, ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and vitamins to increase the density of macular pigment in first-generation offspring of parents with neovascular AMD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study was a randomized clinical trial (Lutein Influence on Macula of Persons Issued From AMD Parents [LIMPIA]) with a 6-month treatment period, followed by a 6-month follow-up period. Analyses were based on the intent-to-treat principle. The setting was 2 university hospitals in France (at Bordeaux and Dijon) from January 2011 (first participant first visit) to February 2013 (last participant last visit). The analysis was conducted from January to November 2016. Participants were 120 individuals free of any retinal ocular disease. They were first-generation offspring of parents with neovascular AMD. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 2 daily dietary supplementation capsules or placebo for 6 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary assessment criterion was the evolution of MPOD after 6 months of supplementation (value of both eligible eyes) measured using the modified MPD-Visucam 200 (Carl Zeiss Meditec) and the modified Heidelberg Retina Angiograph (Heidelberg Engineering) (HRA) at 0.98° eccentricity. The statistical analysis was adjusted for hospital and for risk factors. RESULTS: Overall, 120 participants (60 in each group) were included, and 239 eyes were analyzed (119 in the lutein plus zeaxanthin [L + Z] group and 120 in the placebo group). Their mean (SD) age was 56.7 (6.6) years, and 71.7% (n = 86) were female. A statistically significant increase in plasma lutein and zeaxanthin was shown in the L + Z group after 3 months and 6 months of treatment compared with the placebo group. However, the difference between groups in the evolution of MPOD measured by HRA 0.98° eccentricity between 6 months and baseline was 0.036 (95% CI, -0.037 to 0.110) (P = .33). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among first-generation offspring of parents with neovascular AMD in the LIMPIA trial, MPOD as measured with the modified HRA and the MPD-Visucam was not modified after 6 months of lutein and zeaxanthin dietary supplementation despite plasma levels showing continuous exposure to lutein and zeaxanthin. Further research is necessary to understand the mechanism of absorption and metabolism of these nutrients in the macula, the best way to measure MPOD, and the clinical benefit for the patients.

      "abstract": "Zeaxanthin epoxidase plays an important role in indirect pathway of plant abscisic acid biosynthesis. According to the data of Pseudostellaria heterophylla transcriptome, zeaxanthin epoxidase gene was isolated and named as PhZEP. The results of bioinformatics analysis showed that the coding sequence of PhZEP was 1 263 bp long and encoded 420 amino acids. The putative protein molecular weight was 47.34 kDa and its theoretical isoelectric point was 6.64. The characteristic structure domains were predicted, including binding site of lipoprotein and flavoprotein monooxyenase. A signal peptide was discovered at the N-terminal of amino acids. The Real-time PCR revealed that PhZEP had a higher expression level in leaves than other tissues of P.heterophylla. Highly expressed PhZEP was also observed at 10 d and 40 d tuberous root after flowering. PhZEP presented a different expression after treatment with ABA, fluridone and ABA +fluridone compared to the control. The expression of PhZEP in tuberous root after ABA treatment was close to that in control group, while PhZEP showed significant up-regulation in the fluridone treatment group. In this study, the PhZEP gene from P. heterophylla was cloned and this result has important significance for its functional identification. This research provides a basis for the further analysis on functional mechanism of ABA during development of P. heterophylla.",

      "abstract": "Zeaxanthin, a type of carotenoid, has been proven to exhibit anti-lipogenesis effect; however, the detailed mechanism of this effect is less known. Herein, we evaluated the effects of zeaxanthin on the inhibition of adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and obesity in high-fat diet fed C57BL/6J mice. Zeaxanthin significantly decreased the intracellular lipid content in a dose-dependent manner (5-15 μM) in adipocytes without causing cytotoxicity. In high-fat-diet-induced obese mice, oral administration of 20 mg kg-1 zeaxanthin attenuated the progression of obesity and improved dyslipidemia. It exhibits an anti-adipogenic effect via down-regulating the transcriptional factors and adipocyte-specific genes involved in adipogenesis, both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, zeaxanthin treatment reversed the MDI (0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1.0 μM dexamethasone, and 1.0 μg mL-1 insulin) and HFD (high-fat diet)-induced inhibition of AMPK phosphorylation in adipocytes and epididymal adipose tissues, respectively, thereby modulating the energy metabolism. These results indicated that zeaxanthin plays anti-adipogenic and anti-obesity roles by inducing AMPK activation, inhibiting lipogenesis, and decreasing intracellular lipid content, adipocyte size, and adipose weight.",

We conducted this study to determine whether and how the daily additional consumption of one egg affects serum lipid profiles and parameters of LDL oxidation in moderately hypercholesterolemic males. Nineteen male Japanese adults (total cholesterol [TC]>5.2mmol/L) participated, consuming one soft boiled egg per day for 4weeks in addition to their habitual diet. Despite the significant increase in their intake of dietary cholesterol during the intervention period, the subjects' serum concentrations of TC and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) did not increase. Their serum malondialdehyde modified low-density lipoprotein (MDA-LDL) concentrations were significantly decreased and their LDL oxidation lag times, reflecting the resistance of free-radical-induced LDL lipid peroxidation (ex vivo), was prolonged after 2 and 4weeks. At weeks 2 and 4, the subjects' serum lutein+zeaxanthin concentrations were significantly higher than their baseline values and showed both an inverse relation with MDA-LDL and a positive relationship with the LDL oxidation lag time. These data showed that in moderately hypercholesterolemic males, the additional consumption of one egg per day for 4weeks did not have adverse effects on serum TC or LDL-C, and it might reduce the susceptibility of LDL to oxidation through an increase in the serum lutein and zeaxanthin concentrations.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of zeaxanthin supplementation on in vitro maturation of porcine embryo development. We investigated nuclear maturation, intracellular glutathione (GSH), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels during in vitro maturation, and subsequent embryonic development following parthenogenetic activation and in vitro fertilization (IVF). The oocytes were maturated and used at the metaphase II stage. After 42 hours of in vitro maturation, the zeaxanthin-treated group (0.5 mmol/L) showed significant increases in nuclear maturation (89.6%) than the control group (83.4%) (P<0.05). The intracellular GSH levels increased significantly (P<0.05) as zeaxanthin concentrations increased; ROS generation levels decreased with increased zeaxanthin concentrations, but there were no significant differences. There were no significant differences in subsequent embryonic development, cleavage rate, blastocyst stage rate, and total blastocyst cell numbers following parthenogenetic activation and IVF when in vitro maturation media was supplemented with zeaxanthin. These results suggest that treatment with zeaxanthin during in vitro maturation improved the nuclear maturation of porcine oocytes by increasing the intracellular GSH level, thereby slightly decreasing the intracellular ROS level."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The present study constitutes the first randomized controlled trial to investigate the relation of lutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z) to brain function using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). It was hypothesized that L and Z supplementation in older adults would enhance neural efficiency (i.e., reduce activation) and cognitive performance on a verbal learning task relative to placebo. METHODS: A total of 44 community-dwelling older adults (mean age=72 years) were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or L+Z supplementation (12 mg/daily) for 1 year. Neurocognitive performance was assessed at baseline and post-intervention on an fMRI-adapted task involving learning and recalling word pairs. Imaging contrasts of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal were created by subtracting active control trials from learning and recall trials. A flexible factorial model was employed to investigate the expected group (placebo vs. supplement) by time (baseline vs. post-intervention) interaction in pre-specified regions-of-interest. RESULTS: L and Z appeared to buffer cognitive decline on the verbal learning task (Cohen's d=.84). Significant interactions during learning were observed in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex (p < .05, family-wise-error corrected). However, these effects were in the direction of increased rather than decreased BOLD signal. Although the omnibus interaction was not significant during recall, within-group contrasts revealed significant increases in left prefrontal activation in the supplement group only. CONCLUSIONS: L and Z supplementation appears to benefit neurocognitive function by enhancing cerebral perfusion, even if consumed for a discrete period of time in late life.

In the worldwide natural products market, consumers prefer pigments that have been produced from biological sources. In this study, a Dunaliella tertiolecta strain that has 10-15% higher cellular zeaxanthin content than the parent strain (zea1), was obtained by random mutagenesis using ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) as a mutagen. This mutant, mp3, was grown under various salinities and light intensities to optimize culture conditions for zeaxanthin production. The highest cellular zeaxanthin content was observed at 1.5 M NaCl and 65-85 μmol photons·m-2·s-1, and the highest daily zeaxanthin productivity was observed at 0.6 M NaCl and 140-160 μmol photons·m-2·s-1. The maximal yield of zeaxanthin from mp3 in fed-batch culture was 8 mg·L-1, which was obtained at 0.6 M NaCl and 140-160 μmol photons·m-2·s-1. These results suggest that random mutagenesis with EMS is useful for generating D. tertiolecta strains with increased zeaxanthin content, and also suggest optimal culture conditions for the enhancement of biomass and zeaxanthin production by the zeaxanthin accumulating mutant strains.",

Diabetic rats in this study were induced by high-fat diet and low-dose streptozocin (STZ), cognitive ability of rats were evaluated use morris water maze (MWM) and morphology change in hippocampus was assessed by cresyl violet stain.

Results displayed that supplementation with zeaxanthin reduce blood glucose, improve cognitive deficit, survive neural cell, increase p-AKT level, inhibit Cleaved caspase-3 level and NF-κB nuclear transcription in hippocampus. This study demonstrated that zeaxanthin ameliorate diabetes-related cognitive deficit may by means of protecting neural cell from hyperglycemia involved in AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway.

      "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most important microvascular complications of diabetes and remains the leading cause of blindness in the working-age individuals. The exact aetiopathogenesis of DR remains elusive despite major advances in basic science and clinical research. Oxidative damage as one of the underlying causes for DR is increasingly being recognised. In humans, three hydroxycarotenoids, lutein (L), zeaxanthin (Z) and meso-zeaxanthin (MZ), accumulate at the central retina (to the exclusion of all other dietary carotenoids), where they are collectively known as macular pigment. These hydroxycarotenoids by nature of their biochemical structure and function help neutralise reactive oxygen species, and thereby, prevent oxidative damage to the retina (biological antioxidants). Apart from their key antioxidant function, evidence is emerging that these carotenoids may also exhibit neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory function in the retina. Since the preliminary identification of hydroxycarotenoid in the human macula by Wald in the 1940s, there has been astounding progress in our knowledge of the role of these carotenoids in promoting ocular health. While the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 has established a clinical benefit for L and Z supplements in patients with age-related macular degeneration, the role of these carotenoids in other retinal diseases potentially linked to oxidative damage remains unclear. In this article, we comprehensively review the literature germane to the putative protective role of two hydroxycarotenoids, L and Z, in the pathogenesis of DR.",

An interventional comparative study was thus undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of triple combination therapy with and without zeaxanthin, as well as the economic viability of the therapies. METHODS: The cases of 543 consecutive eyes of 424 patients with subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to AMD were reviewed. All eyes were treated with triple combination therapy (triple therapy) consisting of: (1) reduced-fluence photodynamic therapy with verteporfin, (2) intravitreal bevacizumab and (3) intravitreal dexamethasone. Therapy was repeated as necessary. One cohort of patients was also given supplementation with 20 mg of oral zeaxanthin (Zx) daily. RESULTS: The triple therapy group without Zx received a mean of 2.8 treatment cycles and 87 % of patients had stable or improved vision at 24 months. In the triple therapy group with Zx, the mean number of treatment cycles was 2.1, with 83 % of patients having stable or improved vision at 24 months. At 24 months, CNV developed in 12.5 % of fellow eyes treated with triple therapy alone; CNV developed in 6.25 % of eyes treated with triple therapy with Zx (p = 0.03). An average cost-utility analysis revealed that triple therapy was cost-effective with a cost-utility ratio of $26,574/QALY, while triple therapy with Zx was more cost-effective with an average cost-utility ratio of $19,962/QALY. The incremental cost-utility analysis assessing the addition of Zx to triple therapy disclosed Zx supplementation was very cost-effective at $5302/QALY. When it was assumed that triple therapy with Zx reduced fellow eye CNV development by 30.3 %, the incremental cost-utility dropped to (-$6332/QALY), indicating that adding Zx to triple therapy yielded greater patient value, and was also less expensive than using triple therapy alone. CONCLUSIONS: Triple therapy is comparatively effective and cost-effective. Considerably less treatment is needed than reported in monotherapy studies. The addition of oral Zx appears to further reduce the treatment cycles required, and possibly reduce the risk of CNV development in the fellow eye."

It sometimes co-occurs with abdominal pain, fever, feeling of fatigue, loss of appetite and weight loss. Some dietary factors have been indicated as important in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. The aim of the study was to analyse the association between retinoid intake (total vitamin A, retinol, β-carotene, α-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, lutein and zeaxanthin) and ulcerative colitis symptoms (abdominal pain, faecal blood, faecal mucus, faecal pus) in individuals with ulcerative colitis in remission. METHODS: Assessment of diet was based on self-reported data from each patient's dietary records taken over a period of three typical, random days (2 weekdays and 1 day of the weekend). RESULTS: A total of 56 individuals with ulcerative colitis in remission (19 males and 37 females) were recruited for the study. One in every four individuals with ulcerative colitis in remission was characterised as having inadequate vitamin A intake. Higher lycopene, lutein and zeaxanthin intakes in individuals with ulcerative colitis in remission were associated with lower faecal blood, mucus and pus but not with lower incidence of abdominal pain. Higher carotene intake in individuals with ulcerative colitis in remission may contribute to higher incidence of faecal mucus. CONCLUSIONS: Optimising intake of specific retinoids may enhance disease control in individuals with ulcerative colitis. Prospective studies, including patient reported and objective outcomes, are required to confirm this.",

Medline, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases was searched through May 2016. Meta-analysis was conducted to obtain adjusted weighted mean differences (WMD) for intervention-versus-placebo group about the change of MPOD between baseline and terminal point. Pearson correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between the changes in MPOD and blood xanthophyll carotenoids or baseline MPOD levels. Twenty RCTs involving 938 AMD patients and 826 healthy subjects were identified. Xanthophyll carotenoids supplementation was associated with significant increase in MPOD in AMD patients (WMD, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.11) and healthy subjects (WMD, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.14). Stratified analysis showed a greater increase in MPOD among trials supplemented and combined with meso-zeaxanthin. Additionally, the changes in MPOD were related with baseline MPOD levels (rAMD = -0.43, p = 0.06; rhealthy subjects = -0.71, p < 0.001) and blood xanthophyll carotenoids concentration (rAMD = 0.40, p = 0.07; rhealthy subjects = 0.33, p = 0.05). This meta-analysis revealed that lutein, zeaxanthin and meso-zeaxanthin supplementation improved MPOD both in AMD patients and healthy subjects with a dose-response relationship.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients diagnosed with MacTel 2 were started on lutein 10 mg, meso-zeaxanthin 10 mg, and zeaxanthin 2 mg and were followed-up for a mean period of 15.7 months ± 4.85 months. RESULTS: Visual acuity improved in three patients (13%), and there was a reduction in the percentage of patients who had worsening vision (25% to 4%; P < .05). Optical coherence tomography changes showed a reduction in the number of cavitations and the largest diameter of the cavitation after the LMZ3 supplements were started. The largest diameter of photoreceptor disruption showed mild improvement in the first 6 months after LMZ3 supplements were started. CONCLUSION: LMZ3 supplements may stabilize vision and improve the cavitations in patients with MacTel 2. Larger randomized, controlled studies are required to verify these pilot results.

A total of 300 57-week-old Hy-Line Brown laying hens were randomly assigned to one of 5 treatment groups (feeding duration) with 6 replicates consisting of 5 consecutive cages with 2 hens per cage. Diets were formulated to contain either 0% (the control diet) or 20% DDGS. Experimental diets were fed to hens for 12 wk. The feeding duration of diets containing 20% DDGS was 0, 3, 6, 9, or 12 wk before the conclusion of the experiment. Feeding the diet containing 20% DDGS for 3, 6, or 9 wk followed feeding the control diet for 9, 6, or 3 wk, respectively. The data for productive performance were summarized for 12 wk of the feeding trial. Results indicated that increasing feeding duration of diets containing 20% DDGS had no effects on productive performance of laying hens, but increased egg yolk color (linear, P < 0.01), hunter a* value (linear and quadratic, P < 0.01), and b* values (linear, P < 0.05) with a decrease in hunter L* value (linear and quadratic, P < 0.05). Lutein and zeaxanthin concentrations of egg yolks also were increased (linear, P < 0.01) by increasing the feeding duration of diets containing 20% DDGS. In conclusion, feeding diets containing 20% DDGS to laying hens has no adverse effects on productive performance. Increasing the feeding duration of diets containing 20% DDGS improves egg yolk coloration with a concomitant increase in lutein and zeaxanthin concentrations of egg yolks in laying hens.",

The retina is one of the most metabolically active tissues in the body. The highest concentration of xanthophylls is found within the retina, and this selective presence has generated many theories regarding their role in supporting retinal function. Subsequently, the effect of xanthophylls in the prevention and treatment of various eye diseases has been examined through epidemiological studies, animal studies, and clinical trials. This paper attempts to review the epidemiological studies and clinical trials investigating the effects of xanthophylls on the incidence and progression of various eye diseases. Observational studies have reported that increased dietary intake and higher serum levels of lutein and zeaxanthin are associated with lower risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), especially late AMD. Randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that xanthophyll supplementation increases macular pigment levels, improves visual function, and decreases the risk of progression to late AMD, especially neovascular AMD. Current publications on the preventive and therapeutic effects of lutein and zeaxanthin on cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, and retinopathy of prematurity have reported encouraging results."

After 21 days, mice were sacrificed and the eyes enucleated. Histopathological analysis was performed in hematoxylin and eosin stained frozen sections. Melanoma developed rapidly in the control group (without treatment of zeaxanthin). Tumor-bearing eye mass and tumor mass in the control group were significantly greater than those in zeaxanthin treated group. Melanoma in the controlled eyes occupied a large part of the eye, was epithelioid in morphology, and was with numerous mitotic figures. Scleral perforation and extraocular extension were observed in half of the eyes. Melanomas in zeaxanthin treated eyes were significantly smaller with many necrosis and apoptosis areas and no extraocular extension could be found. Quantitative image analysis revealed that the tumor size was reduced by 56% in eyes treated with low dosages of zeaxanthin and 92% in eyes treatment with high dosages of zeaxanthin, as compared to the controls. This study demonstrated that zeaxanthin significantly inhibits the growth and invasion of human uveal melanoma in nude mice, suggesting that zeaxanthin may be a promising agent to be explored for the prevention and treatment of uveal melanoma."

The effects of lutein and zeaxanthin on the prevention and treatment of various eye diseases, including age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and cataract, ischemic/hypoxia induced retinopathy, light damage of the retina, retinitis pigmentosa, retinal detachment, and uveitis, have been studied in different experimental animal models. In these animal models, lutein and zeaxanthin have been reported to have beneficial effects in protecting ocular tissues and cells (especially the retinal neurons) against damage caused by different etiological factors. The mechanisms responsible for these effects of lutein and zeaxanthin include prevention of phototoxic damage by absorption of blue light, reduction of oxidative stress through antioxidant activity and free radical scavenging, and their anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic properties. The results of these experimental animal studies may provide new preventive and therapeutic procedures for clinical management of various vision-threatening diseases."

      "abstract": "The zeaxanthin epoxidase gene ( MsZEP ) was cloned and characterized from alfalfa and validated for its function of tolerance toward drought and salt stresses by heterologous expression in Nicotiana tabacum. Zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP) plays important roles in plant response to various environment stresses due to its functions in ABA biosynthetic and the xanthophyll cycle. To understand the expression characteristics and the biological functions of ZEP in alfalfa (Medicago sativa), a novel gene, designated as MsZEP (KM044311), was cloned, characterized and overexpressed in Nicotiana tabacum. The open reading frame of MsZEP contains 1992 bp nucleotides and encodes a 663-amino acid polypeptide. Amino acid sequence alignment indicated that deduced MsZEP protein was highly homologous to other plant ZEP sequences. Phylogenetic analysis showed that MsZEP was grouped into a branch with other legume plants. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed that MsZEP gene expression was clearly tissue-specific, and the expression levels were higher in green tissues (leaves and stems) than in roots. MsZEP expression decreased in shoots under drought, cold, heat and ABA treatment, while the expression levels in roots showed different trends. Besides, the results showed that nodules could up-regulate the MsZEP expression under non-stressful conditions and in the earlier stage of different abiotic stress. Heterologous expression of the MsZEP gene in N. tabacum could confer tolerance to drought and salt stress by affecting various physiological pathways, ABA levels and stress-responsive genes expression. Taken together, these results suggested that the MsZEP gene may be involved in alfalfa responses to different abiotic stresses and nodules, and could enhance drought and salt tolerance of transgenic tobacco by heterologous expression.",

Here a keratinocyte culture was used to investigate the effects of in vitro xanthophyll treatment on gene expression and biochemical pathways. METHODS: We employed the EpiDerm tissue model, Affymetrix Human Genome Array U113, bioinformatics analyses, qPCR validation and biochemical assays for glycosaminoglycans. RESULTS: We discovered 176 genes were significantly (p<0.05) down-regulated (log 2FC>2) and 47 genes were significantly up-regulated. Among the down-regulated genes we validated by qPCR marked reduction in expression of peptidase inhibitors. Bioinformatic analysis of the up-regulated genes implicated biosynthetic pathways for glycosaminoglycans. We assayed but found no increase in production of sulfated glycosaminoglycans, however there was a significant increase in biosynthesis of hyaluronic acid, a non-sulfated glycan. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of xanthophyll-regulated genes and the resulting biochemical responses can be linked with the responses observed in clinic trials. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Skin health benefits from xanthophyll supplementation and this study reveals molecular mechanisms for some of the effects."

METHODS: In this randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled trial, 112 early AMD patients randomly received either 10 mg lutein, 20 mg lutein, a combination of lutein (10 mg) and zeaxanthin (10 mg), or placebo daily for 2 years. Serum concentration of lutein/zeaxanthin, macular pigment optical density (MPOD), visual functions including best-spectacle corrected visual acuity (BCVA), contrast sensitivity (CS), flash recovery time (FRT), and vision-related quality of life (VFQ25) was quantified. RESULTS: Serum lutein concentration and MPOD significantly increased in all the active treatment groups. Supplementation with 20 mg lutein was the most effective in increasing MPOD and CS at 3 cycles/degree for the first 48 weeks. However, they both significantly increased to the same peak value following supplementation with either 10 mg or 20 mg lutein during the intervention. No statistical changes of BCVA or FRT were observed during the trial. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term lutein supplementation could increase serum lutein concentration, MPOD, and visual sensitivities of early AMD patients. 10 mg lutein daily might be an advisable long-term dosage for early AMD treatment.",

OBJECTIVE: Oxidative stress plays a decisive role in numerous degenerative diseases including cancer. The present study evaluates anti-inflammatory effect of MZ. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Balb/c mice were treated with different doses of MZ (50 and 250 mg/kg b.wt, orally) 5 d before subcutaneous injection of carrageenan (1%), dextran (1%), and formalin (2%). Paw edema formation in MZ-treated and -untreated animals was measured using vernier calipers. Anti-inflammatory activity of MZ against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory model was studied by culturing macrophages in the presence and absence of LPS (5 μg/ml) and different concentrations of MZ (5, 10, and 25 μg/ml). After 24 h, the effect of MZ on pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in macrophages was analyzed by ELISA and its effect on various inflammatory genes was studied by RT-PCR. RESULTS: MZ administration at different doses significantly (p < 0.001) inhibited paw edema induced by carrageenan, dextran, and formalin in mice. MZ also exhibited profound anti-inflammatory effect against LPS-induced inflammation in macrophages. Increased production of nitric oxide, C-reactive proteins, and various pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6) in LPS-stimulated macrophages was significantly reduced by MZ treatment. Moreover, LPS-stimulated up-regulated mRNA expression of various inflammatory mediator genes like COX-2, TNF-α, and iNOS was down-regulated by MZ administration. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: MZ has potent anti-inflammatory effect which can be due to its down-regulated expression of various inflammatory mediator genes. Since cancer is considered as an inflammatory disease, the present study points towards the importance of MZ in chemo-preventive strategy.",

The effects of zeaxanthin, a natural phytochemical, on the VEGF and HIF-1α expression in the primary culture of human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells were studied. An in vitro RPE cell hypoxia model was established by placing cells under 1% oxygen pressure or by adding cobalt chloride (CoCl2) to the culture medium. RPE cells and conditioned media were collected from cultures treated with and without zeaxanthin under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. VEGF and HIF-1α protein and RNA levels were measured by ELISA kits and RT-PCR, respectively. Hypoxia caused a significant increase of VEGF expression and accumulation of HIF-1α in RPE cells. Zeaxanthin at 50-150 μM significantly inhibited the expression of VEGF and accumulation of HIF-1α protein caused by hypoxia but did not affect expression of VEGF and HIF-1α under normoxic conditions. This is the first report on the effect of zeaxanthin on VEGF and HIF-1α levels in cultured RPE cells and suggests that zeaxanthin may have potential value in the prevention and treatment of various retinal diseases associated with vascular leakage and neovascularization.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of lutein and zeaxanthin on visual function in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of AMD patients. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by searches on PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library database up to April 2014. Three investigators independently determined the eligibility of RCTs, which compared lutein and zeaxanthin intervention with placebo. The adjusted weighted mean differences (WMDs) from each study were extracted to calculate a pooled estimate with its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). The main outcome measurements included visual acuity (VA), contrast sensitivity (CS), glare recovery time (GRT), and subjective perception of visual quality. RESULTS: Eight RCTs involving 1176 AMD patients were included in the meta-analysis. Xanthophyll carotenoids supplementation was associated with significant decrease in logMAR levels compared with the placebo group (WMD, -0.04; 95% CI, -0.06 to -0.03), and during intervention, each 1-mg/day increase in these carotenoids supplementation was related to a 0.003 reduction in logMAR level of VA. Remarkable benefit was also observed at all four spatial frequencies of CS (WMD ranging from 0.08-0.18; all P < 0.05) in contrast to placebo. Furthermore, association was observed between the postintervention increase in macular pigment optical density and improvements in VA (r = -0.58; P = 0.02), and in CS at 12 cycles/degree as well (r = 0.94; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Lutein and zeaxanthin supplementation is a safe strategy for improving visual performance of AMD patients, which mainly showed in a dose-response relationship.",

      "abstract": "Speed of processing is a particularly important characteristic of the visual system. Often a behavioral reaction to a visual stimulus must be faster than the conscious perception of that stimulus, as is the case with many sports (e.g., baseball). Visual psychophysics provides a relatively simple and precise means of measuring visual processing speed called the temporal contrast sensitivity function (tCSF). Past study has shown that macular pigment (a collection of xanthophylls, lutein (L), meso-zeaxanthin (MZ) and zeaxanthin (Z), found in the retina) optical density (MPOD) is positively correlated with the tCSF. In this study, we found similar correlations when testing 102 young healthy subjects. As a follow-up, we randomized 69 subjects to receive a placebo (n=15) or one of two L and Z supplements (n=54). MPOD and tCSF were measured psychophysically at baseline and 4months. Neither MPOD nor tCSF changed for the placebo condition, but both improved significantly as a result of supplementation. These results show that an intervention with L and Z can increase processing speed even in young healthy subjects.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Past studies have shown that higher macular pigment optical density (MPOD) and lutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z) supplementation are related to improvements in glare disability, photostress recovery, and chromatic contrast. This study assessed those links using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. METHODS: The visual effects of 1 year of supplementing L (10 mg/d) and Z (2 mg/d) were investigated. One hundred fifteen young, healthy subjects were recruited and randomized into the study (58 received placebo, 57 L+Z). Several dependent measures were collected at baseline and then once every 3 months: serum L and Z measured by HPLC chromatography; MPOD measured using customized heterochromatic flicker photometry; photostress recovery assessed by measuring the time needed to recover visual acquisition of a grating target after 30 seconds of an intense xenon white flash exposure; glare disability evaluated as the energy in a surrounding annulus necessary to veil a central grating target; and chromatic contrast assessed by measuring thresholds for a yellow grating target superposed on a 460-nm background. RESULTS: Macular pigment optical density increased significantly versus placebo at all eccentricities (10, 30, 60, and 105 minutes from the center of the macula). Serum L and Z also increased significantly by the first follow-up visit (at 3 months), and remained elevated throughout the intervention period of 1 year. Chromatic contrast and photostress recovery time improved significantly versus placebo. Glare disability was correlated with macular pigment density throughout the study period but did not increase significantly in the treated group. CONCLUSIONS: Daily supplementation with L+Z resulted in significant increase in serum levels and MPOD and improvements in chromatic contrast and recovery from photostress. These results are consistent with past studies showing that increasing MPOD leads to improved visual performance. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00909090.).",

Selective mechanisms exist for their intestinal uptake and tissue-selective distribution, but these are poorly understood. We investigated the role of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), apolipoprotein (apo) A1 and ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC) A1 in intestinal uptake of lutein in a human polarized intestinal cell culture and a hamster model. Animals received dietary lutein and zeaxanthin and either a liver X receptor (LXR) agonist or statin, which up- or down-regulate intestinal ABCA1 expression, respectively. The role of HDL was studied following treatment with the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) modulator dalcetrapib or the CETP inhibitor anacetrapib. In vitro, intestinal ABCA1 at the basolateral surface of enterocytes transferred lutein and zeaxanthin to apoA1, not to mature HDL. In hamsters, plasma lutein and zeaxanthin levels were markedly increased with the LXR agonist and decreased with simvastatin. Dalcetrapib, but not anacetrapib, increased plasma and liver lutein and zeaxanthin levels. ABCA1 expression and apoA1 acceptor activity are important initial steps in intestinal uptake and maintenance of lutein and zeaxanthin levels by an HDL-dependent pathway. Their absorption may be improved by physiological and pharmacological interventions affecting HDL metabolism.",

METHODS: 112 patients with early AMD were randomly (1:1:1:1) assigned to receive 10 mg lutein, 20 mg lutein, lutein (10 mg)+zeaxanthin (10 mg), or placebo daily for 2 years. MP optical density (MPOD) was recorded at baseline, 48 weeks and 2 years. Retinal sensitivities were measured by multifocal electroretinogram for peak-to-trough amplitude (N1P1) at baseline and at 48 weeks, and in terms of microperimeter-determined mean retinal sensitivity (MRS) at 48 weeks and 2 years. RESULTS: Supplementation with lutein and zeaxanthin augmented MPOD significantly in active treatment groups (all p<0.05). N1P1 response densities showed significant increases in ring 1 and ring 2 after 48 weeks of supplementation, while no significant changes were seen in rings 3-6. Significant increases in MRS were detected after supplementation with either 10 or 20 mg lutein, whereas no such increases were seen in the placebo arm. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with lutein and/or zeaxanthin increases MPOD, and supplemental lutein enhances retinal sensitivity, in patients with early AMD.

The objective of the present study was to investigate potential adverse effects of OmniXan™, a RR-zeaxanthin (65%) enriched product obtained from paprika (Capsicum annum fruits) in subchronic toxicity and mutagenicity studies. The oral LD50 of OmniXan(TM) in rats was greater than 2000 mg/kgbody weight (bw)/day. For the subchronic toxicity study, Wistar rats (10/sex/group) were gavaged daily with zeaxanthin concentrate at doses of 0, 4, 40 and 400 mg/kg bw/day for 90-days. No treatment related clinical signs and mortalities observed. Similarly, no treatment related toxicologically significant changes in body weight, feed consumption; ophthalmoscopic examination, neurological examination, hematology, urine analysis and organ weights were observed. Statistically significant changes observed in some clinical chemistry parameters were considered toxicologically and biologically insignificant and nonadverse. Macroscopic and microscopic examinations did not reveal treatment-related abnormalities. The results of mutagenicity testing using Salmonella typhimurium did not reveal any genotoxicity. The no observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for zeaxanthin concentrate (OmniXan(TM)) was determined as 400 mg/kg bw/day, the highest dose tested. The findings of this subchronic toxicity and mutagenicity studies support safety of zeaxanthin concentrate.",

After-treatment with ZD from the 5th week to the 10th week in a 10-week ethanol intragastric administration in rats significantly alleviated the typical AFLD symptoms, including reduction in rat body weight, accumulation of hepatic fat droplets, occurrence of oxidative stress, inflammation, chemoattractive responses and hepatic apoptosis in the liver. The reduction of liver function abnormalities by ZD was partly through lower expression level of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), diminished activity of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) through the restoration of its inhibitor kappa B alpha (IκBα), and the modulation of MAPK pathways including p38 MAPK, JNK and ERK. ZD treatment alone did not pose obvious adverse effect on the healthy rat. In the cellular AFLD model, we also confirmed the inhibition of p38 MAPK and ERK abolished the beneficial effects of ZD. These results provide a scientific rationale for the use of zeaxanthin and its derivatives as new complementary agents for the prevention and treatment of alcoholic liver diseases.",

OBJECTIVE: To determine if supplementing diet with long-chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids or with macular xanthophylls results in a reduced rate of cardiovascular disease (CVD). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Cardiovascular Outcome Study (COS) was an ancillary study of the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2), a factorial-designed randomized clinical trial of 4203 participants recruited from 82 US academic and community ophthalmology clinics, who were followed up for a median of 4.8 years. Individuals were eligible to participate if they were between the ages of 50 and 85 years, had intermediate or advanced age-related macular degeneration in 1 eye, and were willing to be randomized. Participants with stable, existing CVD (>12 months since initial event) were eligible to participate. Participants, staff, and outcome assessors were masked to intervention. INTERVENTIONS: Daily supplementation with long-chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (350-mg docosahexaenoic acid [DHA] + 650-mg eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]), macular xanthophylls (10-mg lutein + 2-mg zeaxanthin), combination of the two, or matching placebos. These treatments were added to background therapy of the AREDS vitamin and mineral formulation for macular degeneration. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES A composite outcome of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death with 4 prespecified secondary combinations of the primary outcome with hospitalized heart failure, revascularization, or unstable angina. RESULTS: Study participants were primarily white, married, and highly educated, with a median age at baseline of 74 years. A total of 602 cardiovascular events were adjudicated, and 459 were found to meet 1 of the study definitions for a CVD outcome. In intention-to-treat analysis, no reduction in the risk of CVD or secondary CVD outcomes was seen for the DHA + EPA (primary outcome: hazard ratio [HR], 0.95; 95% CI, 0.78-1.17) or lutein + zeaxanthin (primary outcome: HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.77-1.15) groups. No differences in adverse events or serious adverse event were seen by treatment group. The sample size was sufficient to detect a 25% reduction in CVD events with 80% power. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Dietary supplementation of long-chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids or macular xanthophylls in addition to daily intake of minerals and vitamins did not reduce the risk of CVD in elderly participants with age-related macular degeneration.

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) formulation for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) contains vitamin C, vitamin E, beta carotene, and zinc with copper. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) assessed the value of substituting lutein/zeaxanthin in the AREDS formulation because of the demonstrated risk for lung cancer from beta carotene in smokers and former smokers and because lutein and zeaxanthin are important components in the retina. OBJECTIVE: To further examine the effect of lutein/zeaxanthin supplementation on progression to late AMD. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: The Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 is a multicenter, double-masked randomized trial of 4203 participants, aged 50 to 85 years, at risk for developing late AMD; 66% of patients had bilateral large drusen and 34% had large drusen and late AMD in 1 eye. INTERVENTIONS: In addition to taking the original or a variation of the AREDS supplement, participants were randomly assigned in a factorial design to 1 of the following 4 groups: placebo; lutein/zeaxanthin, 10 mg/2 mg; omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty 3 acids, 1.0 g; or the combination. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURE: S Documented development of late AMD by central, masked grading of annual retinal photographs or by treatment history. RESULTS In exploratory analysis of lutein/zeaxanthin vs no lutein/zeaxanthin, the hazard ratio of the development of late AMD was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.82-0.99; P = .04). Exploratory analyses of direct comparison of lutein/zeaxanthin vs beta carotene showed hazard ratios of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.69-0.96; P = .02) for development of late AMD, 0.78 (95% CI, 0.64-0.94; P = .01) for development of neovascular AMD, and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.70-1.26; P = .67) for development of central geographic atrophy. In analyses restricted to eyes with bilateral large drusen at baseline, the direct comparison of lutein/zeaxanthin vs beta carotene showed hazard ratios of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.61-0.96; P = .02) for progression to late AMD, 0.65 (95% CI, 0.49-0.85; P = .002) for neovascular AMD, and 0.98 (95% CI, 0.69-1.39; P = .91) for central geographic atrophy. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The totality of evidence on beneficial and adverse effects from AREDS2 and other studies suggests that lutein/zeaxanthin could be more appropriate than beta carotene in the AREDS-type supplements.

      "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of blindness worldwide. Oxidative stress plays a large role in the pathogenesis of AMD. The present study was to evaluate the effects of Fructus lycii ethanol extract on AMD in mice and to investigate whether combination of lutein and zeaxanthin, two carotenoid pigments in Fructus lycii, could protect human retinal pigment epithelial ARPE-19 cells treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in vitro. We found that severe sediment beneath retinal pigment epithelium and thickened Bruch membrane occurred in AMD mice. However, Fructus lycii ethanol extract improved the histopathologic changes and decreased the thickness of Bruch membrane. Furthermore, the gene and protein expression of cathepsin B and cystatin C was upregulated in AMD mice but was eliminated by Fructus lycii ethanol extract. Investigations in vitro showed that ARPE-19 cell proliferation was suppressed by H2O2. However, lutein/zeaxanthin not only stimulated cell proliferation but also abrogated the enhanced expression of MMP-2 and TIMP-1 in H2O2-treated ARPE-19 cells. These data collectively suggested that Fructus lycii ethanol extract and its active components lutein/zeaxanthin had protective effects on AMD in vivo and in vitro, providing novel insights into the beneficial role of Fructus lycii for AMD therapy."
