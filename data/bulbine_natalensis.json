      "abstract": "Bulbine natalensis and Chorophytum comosum are potential medicinal source for the treatment of cancers. Chronic myeloid leukaemia is a hematopoietic stem cells disorder treated by tyrosine kinase inhibitors but often cause recurrence of the leukaemia after cessation of therapy, hence require alternative treatment. This study determines the anti-cancer effect of leaf, root and bulb methanolic and aqueous extracts of B. natalensis and C. comosum in chronic human myelogenous leukaemia (K562) cell line by MTT, Hoechst bis-benzimide nuclear and annexin V stain assays. The root methanolic extract of B. natalensis and C. comosum showed a high cytotoxicity of 8.6% and 16.7% respectively on the K562 cell line at 1,000 μg/ml concentration. Morphological loss of cell membrane integrity causing degradation of the cell and fragmentation were observed in the root methanolic extract of both plants. A high apoptosis (p < 0.0001) was induced in the K562 cells by both leaf and root extracts of the C. comosum compared to the B. natalensis. This study shows both plants possess apoptotic effect against in vitro myelogenous leukaemia which contributes to the overall anti-cancer properties of B. natalensis and C. comosum to justify future therapeutic applications against chronic myelogenous leukaemia blood cancer.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The gel from the leaves of Bulbine natalensis (BN) and Bulbine frutescens (BF) is commonly used as a traditional medicine in South Africa for the treatment of skin wounds and burns. Treatment with both leaf gel extracts has previously been demonstrated to increase tensile strength and protein and DNA content in pig dermal wounds. This study examined the effect of the leaf gel extracts in vivo on histology of wound healing in pigs to elucidate the mechanism of increased tensile strength. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mirror imaged wounds on the dorsum of 12 post weaning female pigs were treated with either BN or BF, biopsied at days 2, 4, 7, 10 and 16 post-wounding and fixed. Sections of wound tissue were then stained with haematoxylin and eosin and Mallory's stain to analyse the general morphology and collagen arrangement; and smooth muscle actin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) receptors were immunolocalised. RESULTS: Histological analysis of the wound tissue in the study indicated earlier wound contraction and collagen deposition in both treatment groups with re-organisation of the collagen (indicating collagen maturation) evident as early as at day 10. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggests that the leaf extracts increase tensile strength by increasing fibroplasia, differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, and increased collagen deposition and maturation. This study further validates the use of the Bulbine leaf gels for the treatment of skin wounds.",

      "abstract": "AIM OF THE STUDY: In South Africa the local population relies extensively on indigenous plants in the formulation of traditional medicines to treat skin ailments. The scientific merits of many of these plants used to treat wounds and burns are yet to be validated. Bulbine natalensis and Bulbine frutescens of the Asphodelaceae family are indigenous to only southern Africa and are widely used as a skin remedy. This study aimed to explore the scientific value of these plants through investigating the in vivo biochemical effects of Bulbine natalensis and Bulbine frutescens on cutaneous wounds. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Excisional and incisional wounds treated with either B. natalensis or B. frutescens and mirrored control wounds were created on the back of 12 domestic pigs. Wound contraction was recorded daily. The excisional wounds, biopsied at days 2, 4, 7, 10 and 16, were used to analyse the biochemical composition of the wounds by estimating the total amount of protein, DNA, collagen and hexosamine present. The incisional wounds, biopsied at day 16, were used to test the tensile strength of the healed wounds using a tensiometer. RESULTS: Wound contraction following treatment with Bulbine natalensis on days 2, 4 and 10 (p=.004, 0.007 and 0.03, respectively), and Bulbine frutescens on day 4 (p=0.004) increased significantly when compared to the corresponding untreated wounds. The tensile strength of the wounds treated with the leaf gels was significantly stronger than that of the untreated wounds. There was also a significant increase in the collagen, protein and DNA content of the Bulbine natalensis- and Bulbine frutescens-treated wounds compared with that of the untreated wounds (collagen content: p=0.014 and 0.018; protein content: p=0.03 and 0.04; DNA content p=0.04 and 0.04; respectively) over the 16-day experimental period. Treatment with both leaf gels followed the same pattern in hexosamine content with a maximum hexosamine content on day 4 followed by a steady decrease to day 16. No significant difference between the hexosamine content of the wounds of animals treated with either Bulbine frutescens or Bulbine natalensis was found. CONCLUSIONS: These findings validate the traditional use of the leaf gel extracts of B. frutescens and B. natalensis in the treatment of wounds and may warrant further investigation towards producing a low-cost effective topical treatment for wounds.",

      "abstract": "The effects of oral administration of aqueous extract of Bulbine natalensis Baker stem at daily doses of 25, 50, and 100mg/kg body weight on the reproductive function of Wistar rats were evaluated. The indices of mating and fertility success as well as quantal frequency increased after 7 days of treatment in all the dose groups except the 100mg/kg body weight group. The number of litters was not statistically different (P>0.05) from the control. Whereas the absolute weights of the epididymis, seminal vesicle, and prostate were not affected, that of the testes was significantly increased. The epididymal sperm count, motility, morphology, and viscosity were not different from the control after 7 days of treatment. The male rat serum testosterone, progesterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone significantly increased in the 25 and 50mg/kg body weight groups, whereas the estradiol concentration decreased significantly at all the doses. The extract dose of 100mg/kg body weight decreased the serum testosterone and progesterone levels in male rats. The prolactin concentration was not affected by all the doses. All the indices of reproduction, maternal, embryo/fetotoxic, teratogenic, and reproductive hormones in the female rats were not statistically different from that of their control except the resorption index, which increased at the dose of 100mg/kg body weight of the extract. Histologic examination of the cross section of rat testes that received the extract at all the doses investigated revealed well-preserved seminiferous tubules with normal amount of stroma, normal population of spermatogenic and supporting cells, as well as normal spermatocytes within the lumen. The results revealed that the aqueous extract of Bulbine natalensis stem at doses of 25 and 50mg/kg body weight enhanced the success rate of mating and fertility due to increased libido as well as the levels of reproductive hormones in male rats. The absence of alterations in the reproductive parameters of female rats at doses of 25 and 50mg/kg body weight of Bulbine natalensis stem extract suggest that the extract is \"safe\" for use at these doses by females during the organogenic period of pregnancy, whereas the extract dose of 100mg/kg body weight portends a negative effect on some reproductive functions of male and female rats.",
