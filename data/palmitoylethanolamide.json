      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Migraines are neurological disorders which significantly impact quality of life. Current pharmacological treatments often have adverse effects, prompting the search for alternatives with fewer side effects. Several studies have described the antimigraine properties of palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and melatonin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our research assessed the efficacy of the association of hydrodispersible PEA (1,200 mg) and melatonin (0.2 mg) by a randomized, three-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (PEATONIDE®; n = 30 patients; placebo; n = 30 patients). The participants were recruited by \"I.N.B.B. Consortium\" in Italy. The primary outcome was the reduction of migraine frequency, while secondary outcomes included the reduction of intensity, duration, and grade of disability. The parameters were assessed by a self-reported daily headache diary. RESULTS: The formulation displayed a significant reduction in frequency (T3 months: 2.2 ± 0.4 MMDs; T0 baseline: 3.4 ± 0.5 MMDs, ***p < 0.001 vs baseline T0) and duration, intensity, disability, and incidence of associated symptoms of migraine attacks after 3 months of treatment. No adverse effects were observed during the treatment. In addition, a significant mitigation of migraine-related symptomatology was observed. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that PEATONIDE® may be a promising adjunctive approach for migraine management. However, given the relatively small sample size, further large-scale and multicenter trials are needed to confirm its clinical applicability in broader migraine population."

      "abstract": "Chronic and acute pain are major comorbidities of sickle cell disease (SCD). Both peripheral and central nervous system mechanisms underlie SCD pain. We investigated the potential roles of endogenous fatty acyl derivatives with endocannabinoid-like activity; using targeted lipidomics of fatty acid ethanolamides and monoacylglycerols, we observed significant reduction of spinal palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) in the humanized, transgenic HbSS-BERK mouse model of SCD (HbSS) when compared to healthy HbAA control mice. PEA is a paracannabinoid lipid mediator that acts as a putative mast cell stabilizer and has been evaluated clinically for mechanical, cold, and joint pain, which are all features of SCD pain. Increased p38-mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity in the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, and cutaneous mast cell activation, contribute to chronic hyperalgesia in sickle mice. We provide the first evidence that inhibiting endogenous PEA degradation and administration of exogenous PEA, reduces measures of chronic hyperalgesia via inhibition of peripheral and central mechanisms of pain hypersensitivity in sickle mice. PEA alleviated spinal inflammation, oxidative stress, and p38-MAPK activity; in the periphery, inhibited p38-MAPK phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in DRG neurons, reduced mast cell extracellular trap formation, and markers of inflammation in HbSS mice. Additionally, PEA treatment prevented and ameliorated acute hyperalgesia incited by hypoxia/reoxygenation challenge in sickle mice. Pain may persist even after hydroxyurea and curative therapies in SCD. PEA displayed safety in several clinical studies and has the translational potential to treat pain in SCD without the burden of additional medications."

      "abstract": "Frontotemporal dementia is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder for which no pharmacological treatments have been approved. Neuroinflammation plays a central role in driving the pathogenic mechanisms underlying frontotemporal dementia. In the last few years, co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline has emerged as a potential therapeutic molecule in neurodegenerative disorders pathogenically related to frontotemporal dementia, for its demonstrated strong anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Here we wanted to determine whether treatment with co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline may have a clinical impact in frontotemporal dementia patients. We performed a Phase 2, monocentric, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline in frontotemporal dementia patients. Forty eight patients with a diagnosis of probable frontotemporal dementia were randomly assign in a 1:1 ratio to receive co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline oral suspension at the dosage of 700 mg + 70 mg twice/day (n = 25) or placebo twice/day (n = 23) for 24 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome measure was the change at 24-weeks in the Clinical Dementia Rating Dementia Staging Instrument from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center and frontotemporal lobar degeneration modules-sum of boxes (CDR plus NACC FTLD-SoB). Secondary outcome measures included the Frontal Assessment Battery, Screening for Aphasia in Neurodegeneration, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Mini-Mental State Examination and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination Revised. Among 48 patients randomized [mean (SD) age 63.2 (8.4), 23 (47.9%) female], 45 (93%) completed the study. Patients in the co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline group showed less decline for the primary outcome measure (CDR plus NACC FTLD) as compared with patients treated with placebo. The estimated mean change (W0-W24) in CDR plus NACC FTLD score was 0.53 for the co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline group [95% confidence interval (0.12-0.94)] and 1.39 for the placebo group [95% confidence interval (0.96-1.82)], with an estimated mean difference between of 0.86 [95% confidence interval (0.28-1.45), P = 0.005]. Estimated mean change in Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living score was -1.8 for co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline (95% confidence interval, -3.67 to 0.06) and -7.39 for placebo (95% confidence interval -9.34 to -5.45). Estimated mean change in screening for Aphasia in neurodegeneration scores was -3.987 for co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline (95% confidence interval, -7.75 to -0.22) and -10.35 for placebo (95% confidence interval, -14.33 to -6.37). No effect of treatment was found on other secondary outcome measures. Our results demonstrate that co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline shows promising efficacy in slowing down the progression of cognitive and functional symptoms in frontotemporal dementia patients. These findings warrant further investigation and offer potential for the development of effective therapeutic strategies for frontotemporal dementia."

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study investigated PEA for menstrual pain relief. Conducted in Australia from May to December 2023, the study included adults over 18. Participants consumed 300 mg of PEA or a placebo at menstrual pain onset. Pain scores were recorded on the numerical pain rating scale (NRS) every 30 minutes for up to 4 hours. If pain persisted, a second dose was permitted after 2-hours. The primary outcome measure was the reduction in acute menstrual pain scores from the NRS. Secondary outcome measures included the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication, rescue medication use and adverse events. Pain scores were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance. PEA resulted in a significant reduction in pain scores at 1 (p = .045), 1.5 (p = .009), 2 (p = .015) and 2.5 (p = .039) hours post dosage compared to placebo. No difference was seen for the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication, rescue medication used, or adverse events. This study demonstrates PEA supplementation is a safe and effective option for reducing menstrual pain compared to a placebo, with significant pain reduction observed at multiple time points post-dosage.",

This Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020-compliant systematic review aimed at collecting and comprehensively discussing all available data from Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of PEA supplementation across human illnesses in patient populations. Overall, 48 eligible outputs from 47 RCTs were extracted, covering neuropsychiatric (n = 15), neurological (n = 17), somatic (n = 13), and visceral (n = 11) disturbances, as well as PEA effects on blood/plasma or other tissue biomarkers (n = 10). The strongest evidence emerged from RCTs exploring PEA impact on pain management and measures of general wellbeing, especially in its ultramicronized/micronized or cold-water dispersible formulations, showing good tolerability compared to controls. Also, alongside symptom improvement, PEA demonstrated to modulate biomarkers early altered in the initial phases of an illness or contributing to its progression, suggesting a disease-modifying potential. This systematic review provided a comprehensive overview of the therapeutic potential of PEA across RCTs, highlighting its versatility either as monotherapy or add-on treatment for various clinical conditions."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Chronic pain is a debilitating condition that affects a significant proportion of the population. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), a naturally occurring fatty acid amide derived from omega-7 fatty acids, has emerged as a safe and effective alternative for pain management and exerts its effects by interacting with the endocannabinoid system, modulating inflammation, and regulating immune responses. OBJECTIVE: A comprehensive meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of PEA in alleviating pain across various pathologies, considering the nociceptive, neuropathic, or nociplastic nature of pain. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was conducted of 4 databases: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Collaboration Library. DATA EXTRACTION: Randomized clinical trials were selected for analysis. This meta-analysis included 18 studies involving 1196 patients. DATA ANALYSIS: Continuous variables were assessed using a standard mean difference (SMD). Heterogeneity was evaluated using the χ2 test and I2 statistics. Pain was significantly reduced in the PEA group at 6 weeks (SMD, -0.9; 95% CI, -1.60 to -0.31), 8 weeks (SMD, -0.98; 95% CI, -1.61 to -0.36), and 24-26 weeks (SMD, -1.16; 95% CI, -2.15 to -0.17). Quality of life, including pain-related items, was significantly higher in the PEA group (SMD, -0.61; 95% CI, -0.93 to -0.30). Significant differences in favor of PEA were observed at 4 (SMD, -0.36; 95% CI, -0.65 to -0.07) and 8 weeks (SMD, -0.66; 95% CI, -1.15 to -0.17). Palmitoylethanolamide was effective for all pain types: nociceptive (SMD, -0.74; 95% CI, -1.42 to -0.06), neuropathic (SMD, -0.97; 95% CI, -1.54 to -0.39), and nociplastic (SMD, -0.59; 95% CI, -1.15 to -0.03). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis confirmed that PEA effectively reduces pain and enhances quality of life, with significant benefits observed within 4-6 weeks of treatment. Palmitoylethanolamide is a promising alternative to chronic opioid analgesics, potentially reducing the risk of opioid abuse and dependency. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO registration no.

      "abstract": "Menopause leads to a decline in estrogen levels, resulting in significant metabolic alterations that increase the risk of developing metabolic syndrome-a cluster of conditions including central obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Traditional interventions such as hormone replacement therapy carry potential adverse effects, and lifestyle modifications alone may not suffice for all women. This review explores the potential role of palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), an endogenous fatty acid amide, in managing metabolic syndrome during the postmenopausal period. PEA primarily acts by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-α), influencing lipid metabolism, energy homeostasis, and inflammation. Evidence indicates that PEA may promote the browning of white adipocytes, enhancing energy expenditure and reducing adiposity. It also improves lipid profiles by boosting fatty acid oxidation and decreasing lipid synthesis, potentially lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels while increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Additionally, the anti-inflammatory properties of PEA enhance insulin sensitivity by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines that interfere with insulin signaling. PEA may aid in weight management by influencing appetite regulation and improving leptin sensitivity. Furthermore, its neuroprotective effects may address the mood disturbances and cognitive decline associated with menopause. Given these multifaceted biological activities and a favorable safety profile, PEA may represent a promising non-pharmacological supplement for managing metabolic syndrome in postmenopausal women. However, further large-scale clinical studies are necessary to establish its efficacy, optimal dosing, and long-term safety. If validated, PEA could become an integral part of strategies to improve metabolic and neuropsychological health outcomes in this population.",

      "abstract": "To date, no psychotropic medication has shown to effectively halt progression to psychosis among individuals at Clinical High-Risk for psychosis (CHR), fueling the search for novel therapeutic agents. Recent evidence supports Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) signaling as a potential psychosis biomarker, also indicating a therapeutic role for its supplementation in the treatment of psychotic disorders. Nonetheless, the effect of sustained PEA intake in CHR subjects has never been explored so far. We will assess the feasibility of enrolling 20 CHR young adults presenting with attenuated psychotic symptoms (APS) in a 12-week, open-label, investigator-initiated, proof-of-concept, single-arm trial of ultramicronized-PEA (um-PEA) 600 mg/day. Once completed the 12-week phase, participants will be proposed to enter a 24-week extension phase of the study. We will examine um-PEA ability to reduce APS and psychic distress, um-PEA safety and tolerability, and the biological basis of um-PEA effect in terms of modulation of inflammatory response, endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling, and microbiome composition. Our trial aims to address an unmet clinical need in CHR subjects, providing an initial solid basis for the development of future studies evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of PEA supplementation in this group of patients."

Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) has been reported to improve myelinated nerve fiber function in patients experiencing painful CIPN. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of PEA in patients with established CIPN. Methods: Eligible patients were adults who had pain, numbness, tingling, or other symptoms of CIPN for at least three months following completion of paclitaxel, oxaliplatin, or cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Study patients were randomized to one of the two treatment groups (PEA versus placebo, both administered either once or twice daily). The CIPN20 questionnaire was assessed weekly. Results: A total of 17 males and 71 females participated in the study; most had neuropathy from paclitaxel. Most (85%) finished 8 weeks of treatment. There was no suggestion that either of the PEA arms did any better than the combined placebo arms. There was no signal of significant toxicity differences between the three study arms. Quality of life outcome measures were similar between the study arms, as were cognitive function evaluations. Discussion: PEA failed to improve established CIPN. Future trials might explore whether PEA may be effective in preventing CIPN or cognitive changes based on data that suggest it may be helpful in this situation. Conclusions: PEA failed to improve established chemotherapy-induced neuropathy."

      "abstract": "The efficacy of opioids in the treatment of chronic pain is limited; however, the adverse effects they produce are considerable. N-palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), a bioactive lipid mediator with structural similarities to endocannabinoids, has exhibited notable anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects in preclinical models. The objective of this study was to investigate the antinociceptive properties, motor coordination (MC), and constipation effects of tramadol and PEA in combination within a neuropathic pain model. The antinociceptive effects of tramadol (TRA) and PEA in various combination ratios were assessed using a CCI model of neuropathic pain in 126 male Wistar rats, divided into 21 groups: vehicles, GBP (1.0-177.78 mg/kg), TRA (1.0-31.62 mg/kg), PEA (0.0316-10 mg/kg), or TRA (1.0-10 mg/kg) with PEA (0.0316-1.0 mg/kg), all compounds were administered orally. The results of the dose-response analyses indicated that PEA was approximately five and eightfold more potent than tramadol in producing anti-hyperalgesic and anti-allodynic effects, respectively. The results of the surface of synergistic interaction (SSI) analysis indicated that the combination of TRA 10 mg/kg + PEA 0.0316 mg/kg exhibited the most pronounced anti-hyperalgesic effects and the most favorable anti-allodynic outcomes among the various combinations. No significant differences in MC or constipation were observed between the vehicle and optimal combination group. The results of this study demonstrate that sub-antinociceptive doses of tramadol, when combined with PEA, significantly enhance the antinociceptive efficacy of tramadol without the induction of typical opioid-associated side effects. These findings propose a novel approach to the treatment of pain.",

      "abstract": "Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is emerging as a promising therapeutic agent for neuropathic and other pain-related conditions. This naturally occurring fatty acid has drawn interest because of its ability to regulate pain and inflammation. Initially identified in food sources, PEA has been the subject of extensive research to elucidate its properties, efficacy, and clinical applications. PEA primarily exerts its effects through interaction with its primary receptor PPAR α, this interaction influences pain signalling pathways and neuroinflammatory processes by modulating the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines, mast cell degranulation, microglial activation, and decrease of oxidative stress. PEA's interaction with endocannabinoid receptors decreases the inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production and thereby a descending pain sensation. The pharmacological and pharmacokinetic characteristics of PEA are examined in this paper, along with its potential for efficiency when used in in combination additional therapies in a variety of neurodegenerative disease models, including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's. Experimental evidence shows that PEA not only reduces pain and inflammation but also lowers the need for higher dosages of other drugs hence minimizing the risk of drug toxicity. The bioavailability of PEA has been enhanced by recent technological developments, which emphasize continuous research efforts to maximize PEA's therapeutic potential in pain treatment and associated medical sectors.",

      "abstract": "The present studies were undertaken to understand the effects of the commonly used nutraceutical PEA on brain function and lipid chemistry. These studies using MRI and broad-scale lipidomics are without precedent in animal or human research. During the MRI scanning session awake rats were given one of three doses of PEA (3, 10, or 30 mg/kg) or vehicle and imaged for changes in BOLD signal and functional connectivity. There was an inverse dose-response for negative BOLD suggesting a decrease in brain activity affecting the prefrontal ctx, sensorimotor cortices, basal ganglia and thalamus. However, there was a dose-dependent increase in functional connectivity in these same brain areas. Plasma and CNS levels of PEA and over 80 endogenous lipids (endolipids) were determined post treatment. While levels of PEA in the CNS were significantly higher after 30 mg/kg treatment, levels of the endocannabinoid, Anandamide, and at least 20 additional endolipids, were significantly lower across the CNS. Of the 78 endolipids that were detected in all CNS regions evaluated, 51 of them were modulated in at least one of the regions. Taken together, the functional connectivity and lipidomics changes provide evidence that PEA treatment drives substantial changes in CNS activity."

This study aims to summarize what has been published on the topic in the last 15 years and determine the appropriateness of the prescribing. It describes the pharmacological aspect of PEA, especially focusing on its pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. Then, it deeply explores why PEA may be useful in the pharmacological management of both neuropathic and mixed pain. Finally, it examines some innovative patent, which aims to address obstacles encountered with conventional PEA formulations, for its pharmacodynamic characteristics. One of them (Equisetum-PEA) seems promising. It partially ameliorates the bioavailability and the targeted distribution. It seems to introduce novel advancements that can potentially enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of PEA in terms of its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and analgesic properties. The deep literature analysis aims to examine the potential advantages of PEA, in the context of several pathological conditions that may benefit from this molecule. It focuses on various published data regarding the clinical efficacy of PEA in managing neuropathic and mixed pain. Also, it tries to understand if it can modernize the field of therapy based on PEA, thus offering a better treatment option for individuals with chronic long-term inflammation, oxidative stress, and neuropathic or mixed pain with a neuropathic component. The study examines the possible impact of PEA on personalized medicine strategies and its potential for translation into clinical practice. It analyses the possibilities that PEA has in enhancing patient outcomes in a range of central nervous system and inflammatory conditions. A complete analysis of the therapeutic potentialities of this product was missing. This extensive narrative review makes a valuable contribution to the ongoing comprehension of PEA therapy. It establishes a foundation for further exploration in research and potential uses in clinical settings."

      "abstract": "Despite promise of its supplementation as both monotherapy and add-on treatment in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the biobehavioral effects of Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) in autistic adults have never been explored so far. We discussed the cases of two autistic adults with different degrees of severity (level 1 and level 2) presenting with symptoms of psychic distress, who were treated with ultramicronized-PEA (um-PEA) 600 mg/day monotherapy for a sustained period of 4 months. The level 1 autistic patient showed improved depressive symptoms and social engagement at a 12-week follow-up, in parallel to a tendency toward reduced inflammatory response and enhanced endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling, partially relapsing after um-PEA discontinuation at four months. Opposedly, the level 2 autistic patient exhibited a generally stable psychosocial functioning for the initial 12 weeks, consistent with basically unchanged immune and eCBs levels, abruptly deteriorating and leading to antipsychotic initiation afterwards. No significant side effects were reported in both cases during the observation period. The two cases suggest that um-PEA could be an effective option for the treatment of psychic distress in level 1 autistic adults, warranting further investigation of its age- and level-specificity and of the biological underpinnings of its therapeutic effect in ASD."

GERD currently affects about 13% of the world's population and represent a major public health concern due to the increasing prevalence and incidence. The aim of this study was to explore complementary strategies for GERD management based the natural compound palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), alone or associated with plant extracts with demonstrated anti-GERD activity (Zingiber officinale, Musa × paradisiaca, Opuntia ficus-indica and Olea europaea). For this purpose, two in vitro models based on the esophageal mucosa CP-B cell line were chosen. The first one was based on the exposure of esophageal cells to HCl, while the second one was based on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment to cause a strong inflammatory cell response. Inflammation induced was assessed using a Luminex® assay, measuring the secretion of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-8 and TNF-α. Results obtained demonstrate that PEA strongly decreased the inflammatory response elicited by HCl exposure. Moreover, the effect of PEA was enhanced by the presence of natural extracts of Zingiber officinale, Musa × paradisiaca, Opuntia ficus-indica and Olea europaea. PEA should be considered as an anti-GERD natural compound of interest."

      "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that opioid analgesics modulate angiogenesis during pathophysiological processes. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) was recently proposed to be involved in pain development. To date, no anti-angiogenic drug is used for pain management. When administered in a bioavailable formulation, (i.e., ultramicronized) N-palmitoylethanolamine (PEA) delays the onset of morphine tolerance, improves morphine analgesic activity and reduces angiogenesis in in vivo models. This study aimed at investigating whether VEGF-A is involved in PEA-induced delay of morphine tolerance. The anti-VEGF-A monoclonal antibody bevacizumab was used as a reference drug. Preemptive and concomitant treatment with ultramicronized PEA delayed morphine tolerance and potentiated the analgesic effect of morphine, while counteracting morphine-induced increase of VEGF-A in the nervous system. Similar results were obtained when bevacizumab was administered together with morphine. Of note, bevacizumab showed an analgesic effect per se. In equianalgesic treatment regimens (obtained through increasing morphine doses and associating PEA), PEA resulted in lower expression of VEGF-A in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and spinal cord compared to morphine alone. Similar results were observed for plasma levels of the soluble VEGF receptor 1 (sFLT-1). Moreover, in morphine-treated animals, two pain-related genes (i.e., Serpina3n and Eaat2) showed a more than 3-fold increase in their expression at spinal cord and DRG level, with the increase being significantly counteracted by PEA treatment. This study supports the hypothesis that the effects of PEA on morphine analgesia and tolerance may be mediated by the down-modulation of VEGF-A and sFLT-1 in the nervous system and plasma, respectively.",

      "abstract": "The management of allergic events is a growing global health issue, especially in industrialized countries. This disease is an immune-mediated process, regulated by the interaction of IgE with an allergen, resulting in mast cell activation, which concerns the release of several immune-inflammatory modulators, i.e., histamine, β-hexosaminidase, COX-2, IL-6, and TNF-α, responsible for the main allergic-reaction associated symptoms. The aim of the present study was the efficacy evaluation of an alternative remedy, an innovative nutraceutical formulation (NF) based on the synergic combination of melatonin (MEL) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) for the prevention and treatment of immune disease. At first, the intestinal bioaccessibility of PEA and MEL in NF was assessed at 1.6 and 36%, respectively. Then the MEL and PEA ability to modulate the release of immune-inflammatory modulators in the human mast cell line (HMC-1.2) at their bioaccessible concentration was investigated. Our results underline that NF treatment was able to reduce COX-2 mRNA transcription levels (-30% vs. STIM, p < 0.0001) in stimulated HMC-1.2 and to contract COX-2 enzymatic activity directly (IC50: 152 μg/mL). Additionally, NF showed valuable ability in reducing histamine and β-hexosaminidase release in stimulated HMC-1.2, as well as in decreasing TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA transcription levels and protein production."

Recent theories attribute fibromyalgia to central sensitization syndromes, suggesting altered nociceptive processing leads to hyperalgesia and allodynia. Standardized effective treatments are currently lacking. Palmitoylethanolamide and melatonin have shown pain-relieving effects in chronic pain conditions, including fibromyalgia, with excellent safety. Our open-label study assessed the impact of a daily combination of 1200 mg of palmitoylethanolamide and 0.2 mg of melatonin on pain, sleep, and quality of life in fibromyalgia patients. Between June 2023 and March 2024, 50 patients (2016 ACR criteria) were treated and evaluated at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 4 months (1 month discontinuation). The assessments included VAS for pain, ISI for insomnia, HAQ for health assessments, and a tender points evaluation. The patients, averaging 54.12 years old with a 3:1 female-to-male ratio, showed significant improvements in VAS, ISI, and HAQ scores relative to their own baselines and a reduction in tender points at 1 and 3 months, which was maintained at 4 months. No adverse events were reported. This study is the first to demonstrate the efficacy of a palmitoylethanolamide and melatonin combination as an adjunct therapy in fibromyalgia, highlighting its potential to reduce pain and improve sleep and quality of life.",

N-palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), a biologically active lipid, is utilized as an anti-inflammatory and analgesic medication. Recent studies have highlighted PEA's role in mitigating cognitive decline and easing depression resulting from chronic pain. However, it remains unknown whether PEA can influence negative emotions triggered by morphine withdrawal. This study seeks to explore the impact of PEA on such emotions and investigate the underlying mechanisms. Mice subjected to morphine treatment underwent a 10-day withdrawal period, followed by assessments of the effect of PEA on anxiety- and depression-like behaviors using various tests. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was conducted to measure levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in specific brain regions. The findings indicate that PEA mitigated anxiety and depression symptoms and reduced 5-hydroxytryptamine, noradrenaline, and dopamine levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. In summary, PEA demonstrates a significant positive effect on negative emotions associated with morphine withdrawal, accompanied with the reduction in levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in key brain regions. These insights could be valuable for managing negative emotions arising from morphine withdrawal.",

However, its topical application is limited due to its difficulty in bypassing the stratum corneum barrier, relatively low bioavailability, and low stability. Herein, elastic nano-liposomes (ENLs) with excellent deformability and elasticity were utilized as a novel drug delivery system to encapsulate PEA to overcome the abovementioned issues and enhance the biological effects on the skin. ENL was prepared with phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and cetyl-PG hydroxyethyl palmitamide with a molar ratio mimicking skin epidermal lipids, and PEA was loaded. The PEA-loaded ENL (PEA-ENL) demonstrated efficient transdermal delivery and enhanced skin retention, with negligible cytotoxicity toward HaCaT cells and no allergic reaction in the human skin patch test. Notably, PEA-ENL treatment increased cell migration and induced significant regulation in the expression of genes associated with anti-nociceptive, anti-inflammatory, and skin barrier repair. The mechanism of the anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of PEA was further investigated and explained by molecular docking site analysis. This novel PEA-ENL, with efficient transdermal delivery efficiency and multiple skincare functionalities, is promising for topical application."

In this clinical study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment with Palmitoylethanolamide, Epilobium and Calendula extract in patients with CP/CPPS III. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From June 2023 to July 2023, we enrolled 45 consecutive patients affected by CP/CPPS type III in three different institution. We included patients aged between 18 and 75 years with symptoms of pelvic pain for 3 months or more before the study, a total National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) score ≥ 12 point and diagnosed with NIH category III, according to 4-glass test Meares-Stamey test. Patients were then allocated to receive rectal suppositories of PEA, Epilobium and Calendula, 1 suppository/ die for 1 month. All patients have been tested with standard urinalysis in order to assess urinary leukocytes (U-WBC). The primary endpoint of the study was the reduction of NIHCPSI. The secondary outcomes were the change of peak flow, post-void residual (PVR), IIEF-5, VAS score, PSA and decrease of U-WBC. RESULTS: A total of 45 patients concluded the study protocol. At baseline, the median age of all the patients included in the cohort was 49 years, the median PSA was 2.81 ng/ml, the median NIH-CPSI was 18.55, the median IIEF-5 was 18.27, the median U-WBC was 485.3/mmc, the median VAS score was 6.49, the median PVR was 26.5 ml and the median peak flow was 16.3 ml/s. After 1 month of therapy we observed a statistically significant improvement of NIH-CPSI, U-WBC, PSA, IIEF-5, peak flow, PVR and VAS. CONCLUSIONS: In this observational study, we showed the clinical efficacy of the treatment with PEA, Epilobium and Calendula, 1 suppository/die for 1 month, in patients with CP/CPPS III. The benefits of this treatment could be related to the reduction of inflammatory cells in the urine that could imply a reduction of inflammatory cytokines. These results should be confirmed in further studies with greater sample size.",

      "abstract": "Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) emerged over the years as a promising approach in the management of chronic pain. Despite the fact that the efficacy of micron-size PEA formulations appears to be time-dependent, the optimal timing has not yet been elucidated. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to estimate the possible advantage of an extended treatment in the relief of chronic pain. The literature search was conducted consulting scientific databases, to identify clinical trials in which micron-size PEA was administered for at least 60 days, and pain assessed by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) or Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Nine studies matched the required criteria, for a total of 742 patients involved. The meta-analysis showed a statistically and clinically significant pain intensity reduction after 60 days of micron-size PEA supplementation, compared to 30 days (1.36 points, p < 0.01). The secondary analysis revealed a weighted NRS/VAS score decrease of 2.08 points within the first month of treatment. These two obtained scores corresponded to a 35.1% pain intensity reduction within the first month, followed by a further 35.4% during the second month. Overall, these results confirm the clinically relevant and time-depended pain-relieving effect of micron-size PEA and therefore the advantage of an extended treatment, especially in patient with incomplete pain management.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of post-viral olfactory dysfunction has increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, posing a major challenge for patients and practitioners. While olfactory training (OT) is a common approach to therapy, there has been increasing interest in supplementing therapy with a combination of palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and luteolin (LUT), which are known for their anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, their efficacy in the treatment of patients with olfactory loss following upper respiratory tract infections, mainly COVID-19, was investigated in an outpatient clinic. METHODS: Fifty patients with persistent olfactory dysfunction were randomized to two groups: one receiving OT and PEA-LUT, the other OT alone. Olfactory function was evaluated before and after treatment. RESULTS: The study group showed significant improvements in odor discrimination and overall olfactory function (TDI score) after treatment with PEA-LUT and OT, while the control group did not. However, when clinically meaningful improvements were considered, there was no significant difference between the groups. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that while PEA-LUT may have the potential to improve olfactory function in post-viral dysfunction, the additional benefit over OT alone may be limited. These results contrast with some previous studies.",

      "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the most dramatic pandemic of the new millennium and patients with serious infection can stay in intensive care unit (ICU) for weeks in a clinical scenario of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, likely related to the subsequent development of critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP). It is in fact now accepted that COVID-19 ICU surviving patients can develop CIP; moreover, prone positioning-related stretch may favor the onset of positioning-related peripheral nerve injuries (PNI). Therefore, the urgent need to test drug candidates for the treatment of these debilitating sequelae is emerged even more. For the first time in medical literature, we have successfully treated after informed consent a 71-year-old Italian man suffering from post-COVID-19 CIP burdened with positioning-related PNI of the left upper extremity by means of ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide 400 mg plus ultramicronized luteolin 40 mg (Glìalia), two tablets a day 12 hours apart for 6 months. In the wake of our pilot study, a larger clinical trial to definitively ascertain the advantages of this neuroprotective, neurotrophic, and anti-inflammatory therapy is advocated."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) has analgesic/anti-inflammatory properties that may be a suitable alternative to over-the-counter (OTC) non-steroidal analgesics/anti-inflammatories. While OTC pain medications can impair strength training adaptations, the mechanism of action of PEA is distinct from these and it may not negatively affect skeletal muscle adaptations to strength training. METHODS: The primary aim of this study was to investigate the effects of daily PEA supplementation (350 mg Levagen + equivalent to 300 mg PEA) combined with 8-weeks of resistance training on lean body mass with secondary aims addressing strength, power, sleep, and wellbeing compared to placebo (PLA) in young, healthy, active adults. In a randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial, 52 untrained, recreationally active participants aged 18-35 y were allocated to either the PEA or PLA groups. Participants consumed either 2 × 175 mg Levagen + PEA or identically matched maltodextrin capsules during an 8-week period of whole-body resistance training. This trial assessed the pre- to post- changes in total and regional lean body mass, muscular strength (1-RM bench, isometric mid-thigh pull), muscular power [countermovement jump (CMJ), bench throw], pain associated with exercise training, sleep, and wellbeing compared with the PEA or PLA condition. RESULTS: 48 Participants were included in the final intention to treat (ITT) analysis and we also conducted per protocol (PP) analysis (n = 42). There were no significant between-group differences for total or regional lean muscle mass post-intervention. There was a significantly higher jump height (CMJ) at week 10 in the PEA group compared to the PLA (Adjusted mean difference [95% CI] p-value; ITT: - 2.94 cm [- 5.15, - 0.74] p = 0.010; PP: - 2.93 cm [- 5.31, - 0.55] p = 0.017). The PLA group had higher 1-RM bench press post-intervention compared with the PEA group (ITT: 2.24 kg [0.12, 4.37] p = 0.039; PP: 2.73 kg [0.40, 5.06] p = 0.023). No significant treatment effects were noted for any of the other outcomes. CONCLUSION: PEA supplementation, when combined with 8 weeks of strength training, did not impair lean mass gains and it resulted in significantly higher dynamic lower-body power when compared with the PLA condition.

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare autoimmune disease. Neuropathic pain (NP), related to peripheral inflammation, is among its earliest manifestations. This preliminary open-label investigation aimed to evaluate the efficacy of ultramicronized Palmitoylethanolamide (umPEA) in the management of NP. Methods: A total of 14 patients with CIDP, already undergoing immunoglobulin (Ig) therapy, were divided into two groups: Group A received umPEA 600 mg twice daily in addition to Ig for 60 days, followed by Ig alone until the end of the observation (180 days); Group B received Ig alone for 120 days and subsequently umPEA + Ig in the last 60 days of the study. Painful symptom intensity and quality of life were assessed by the Numeric Rating Scale, Neuropathic Pain Symptoms Inventory, and Five Dimensions Health Questionnaire. The safety umPEA profile was evaluated. Results: UmPEA in addition to immunoglobulins allowed for a significant improvement over time in all NP symptoms intensity (p = 0.0007) and in patients' quality of life (p = 0.0036). Conclusions: This study suggests umPEA as a safe and effective treatment in addition to immunoglobulins to improve NP, ameliorating the patient's health status. These results highlight the importance of neuroinflammation modulation in the management of CIDP's painful symptoms, drawing attention to umPEA's potential use also in neuropathies of different etiologies."

      "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic disorders characterized by pain, ulceration, and the inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and categorized into two major subtypes: ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease. The inflammation in UC is typically restricted to the mucosal surface, beginning in the rectum and extending through the entire colon. UC patients typically show increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to intestinal epithelial apoptosis and mucosal inflammation, which impair barrier integrity. Chronic inflammation is associated with the rapid recruitment and inappropriate retention of leukocytes at the site of inflammation, further amplifying the inflammation. While UC can be managed using a number of treatments, these drugs are expensive and cause unwanted side effects. Therefore, a safe and effective treatment for UC patients is needed. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an endogenous fatty acid amide and an analog of the endocannabinoid anandamine. PEA administration has been found to normalize intestinal GIT motility and reduce injury in rodents and humans. In the current study, we examined the efficacy of PEA encapsulated in phytosomes following oral administration in experimental ulcerative colitis. Here, we showed that PEA at a human-equivalent dose of 123 mg/kg (OD or BID) attenuated DSS-induced experimental colitis as represented by the reduction in clinical signs of colitis, reduction in gross mucosal injury, and suppression of leukocyte recruitment at inflamed venules. These findings add to the growing body of data demonstrating the beneficial effects of PEA to control the acute phase of intestinal inflammation occurring during UC."

The limitations of current therapies highlight the necessity of a new innovative approach to treating neuropathic pain (NP) based on the close correlation between oxidative stress, inflammatory process, and antioxidant action. The advantageous outcomes of a novel combination composed of Hop extract, Propolis, Ginkgo Biloba, Vitamin B, and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) used as a treatment was evaluated in this study. To assess the absorption and biodistribution of the combination, its bioavailability was first examined in a 3D intestinal barrier model that replicated intestinal absorption. Further, a 3D nerve tissue model was developed to study the biological impacts of the combination during the essential pathways involved in NP. Our findings show that the combination could cross the intestinal barrier and reach the peripheral nervous system, where it modulates the oxidative stress, inflammation levels, and myelination mechanism (increased NRG, MPZ, ERB, and p75 levels) under Schwann cells damaging. This study proves the effectiveness of Ginkgo Biloba, Propolis, Hop extract, Vitamin B, and PEA in avoiding nerve damage and suggests a potential alternative nutraceutical treatment for NP and neuropathies.",

      "abstract": "Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) are endogenous lipids that act as agonists of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). Recently, an interest in the role of these lipids in malignant tumors has emerged. Nevertheless, the effects of OEA and PEA on human neuroblastoma cells are still not documented. Type I interferons (IFNs) are immunomodulatory cytokines endowed with antiviral and anti-proliferative actions and are used in the treatment of various pathologies such as different cancer forms (i.e., non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, melanoma, leukemia), hepatitis B, hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis, and many others. In this study, we investigated the effect of OEA and PEA on human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells treated with IFNβ. We focused on evaluating cell viability, cell proliferation, and cell signaling. Co-exposure to either OEA or PEA along with IFNβ leads to increased apoptotic cell death marked by the cleavage of caspase 3 and poly-(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) alongside a decrease in survivin and IKBα levels. Moreover, we found that OEA and PEA did not affect IFNβ signaling through the JAK-STAT pathway and the STAT1-inducible protein kinase R (PKR). OEA and PEA also increased the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression both in full cell lysate and surface membranes. Furthermore, GW6471, a PPARα inhibitor, and the genetic silencing of the receptor were shown to lower PD-L1 and cleaved PARP levels. These results reveal the presence of a novel mechanism, independent of the IFNβ-prompted pathway, by which OEA and PEA can directly impair cell survival, proliferation, and clonogenicity through modulating and potentiating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in human SH-SY5Y cells.",

Methods The present prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted on 60 patients (20 in each group). In group I (positive control group), a combination of 75 mg of pregabalin and 10 mg of nortriptyline was administered once daily for the duration of 12 weeks. In group II, 600 mg of palmitoylethanolamide was given twice a day. In group III, a combination therapy of the abovementioned drugs was given. The efficacy of the drug was assessed by measuring pain intensity in terms of the numeric rating scale (NRS) (primary outcome) and changes (signal intensity and nerve thickness) in magnetic resonance neurography (secondary outcome) at various intervals of time. The data was collected and subjected to statistical analysis using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25 (IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY) at the significance level of P<0.05. Results A significant decrease in post-drug mean NRS scores was observed in all three groups. In terms of reduction in the mean NRS, the combination group showed the highest reduction. Palmitoylethanolamide significantly reduces pain scores with negligible side effects. Conclusion Palmitoylethanolamide helps in the reduction of mild to moderate pain of painful post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathy (PTTN) with minimal side effects, suggesting that it may be used where the use of the conventional drug is either contraindicated or not feasible."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of co-micronized palmitoylethanolamide (PEA)/polydatin (PD) in the treatment of abdominal pain symptoms in pediatric patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: This was a multicenter trial conducted at three Italian pediatric gastroenterology centers, employing a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm design. Participants were ages 10 to 17 y and met Rome IV criteria for pediatric IBS. They were randomly allocated to receive either co-micronized PEA/PD or placebo, administered three times daily in a 1:1 ratio, over a 12-wk period. The study assessed baseline severity using the IBS-Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) at enrollment and after 4, 8, and 12 wk of treatment. Abdominal pain frequency was assessed on a scale from 1 to 7 d/wk, while stool consistency was classified using the Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) to categorize various IBS subtypes. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients who achieved complete remission, defined as IBS-SSS score <75 points after 12 wk of therapy. RESULTS: The study involved 70 children with IBS. Of the participants, 34 received co-micronized PEA/PD, and 36 received a placebo. As compared with the placebo group, the co-micronized therapy group had significantly more patients achieving complete remission after 12 wk (P = 0.015), with particular benefit in the IBS-diarrhea subtype (P = 0.01). The treatment group also experienced a significant reduction in abdominal pain intensity and frequency compared with the placebo group. No adverse events were recorded during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Co-micronized PEA/PD is a safe and effective treatment to treat abdominal pain symptoms in pediatric IBS.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Eczema is a debilitating skin disorder clinically characterised by the development of itchy, dry, rough, and scaling skin caused by a series of rudimentary clinical phenotypes. METHODS: This double-blind, randomised, comparator-controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of topical application of a novel palmitoylethanolamide formulation (Levagen+) compared with a standard moisturiser (comparator) to reduce eczema severity and improve patient outcomes. Seventy-two participants aged over 18 years old with atopic eczema (symptoms including redness, dry skin, scaling, and/or itchiness) on their hands or arm were recruited. Participants were randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups (Levagen + or comparator). Treatment was applied to the affected area twice daily for 4 weeks. Outcome measures included Self-Assessed Eczema Area Severity Index (SA-EASI) scoring and Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) from baseline to week 4. RESULTS: Levagen+ was effective at alleviating symptom severity of eczema over 4 weeks. Levagen+ significantly reduced redness, dryness, and total POEM score compared to a comparator cream. CONCLUSION: Levagen+ can significantly reduce eczema symptom severity compared to a comparator product, supporting its use as a potential treatment for eczema.

      "abstract": "Migraines are a common neurological disorder that generally affects young to middle-aged adults and females more than males. Various treatment options are available; however, these can cause undesirable side effects. Therefore, alternative treatments with minimal side effects are still being investigated. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is a signalling lipid known to have anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Previous prophylactic research has reported PEA supplementation to decrease pain associated with migraines. Upon commencement of migraine symptoms, participants were supplemented with either 600 mg of PEA (Levagen+) or a placebo (maltodextrin). Once a dose was taken, participants recorded a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain every 30 min for 4 h or until the migraine resolved. If the migraine had not resolved 2 h post-dose, participants were instructed to take a second dose. Levagen+ supplementation resolved more headaches after 2- and 8 h, had a lower VAS for pain score at 1.5 and 4 h, and reduced rescue medication use significantly more than a placebo. No adverse events were reported in either group. Overall, PEA was safe and effective in reducing migraine pain, duration, and medication use in an otherwise healthy adult population."

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a bioavailable formulated form of PEA (Levagen+®) on serum BDNF levels and parameters of cognitive function in healthy adults. METHODS: A randomised double-blinded placebo-controlled cross-over trial was implemented to measure the effects of a 6-week 700 mg/day course of formulated PEA supplementation versus a placebo. Participants (n = 39) completed pre- and post-assessments of a lab-based cognitive test. Serum samples were collected to measure BDNF concentrations using an immunoassay. RESULTS: A significant increase in serum BDNF levels was found following PEA supplementation compared with the placebo (p = 0. 0057, d = 0.62). The cognition test battery demonstrated improved memory with PEA supplementation through better first success (p = 0.142, d = 0.54) and fewer errors (p = 0.0287; d = -0.47) on the Paired Associates Learning test. CONCLUSION: This was the first study to report a direct beneficial effect of Levagen+® PEA supplementation on memory improvement as well as corresponding increases in circulating neurotrophic marker levels. This suggests that formulated PEA holds promise as an innovative and practical intervention for cognitive health enhancement.",

Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective amide used in depressive syndromes. Here we investigate whether micronized/ultramicronized (m/um) PEA improves neuropsychiatric sequelae in COVID-19 survivors. Patients evaluated at our post-COVID-19 outpatient clinic between February and August 2021 and presenting neuropsychiatric manifestations ( n  = 98) were offered treatment with m/umPEA 600 mg twice daily for 3 months. Those accepting m/umPEA therapy ( n  = 57) were compared with those who did not ( n  = 41), in terms of depression, fatigue, chronic pain and subjective well-being, through validated scales administered pre- and posttreatment. The two groups did not differ in terms of demographics, comorbidities, psychiatric history, antidepressant therapy, acute COVID-19 severity and baseline neuropsychiatric status. Patients receiving m/umPEA showed a greater improvement in depression and fatigue (both P  < 0.05). Conversely, no association was found with changes in chronic pain or subjective well-being. At multivariable logistic regression, m/umPEA predicted neuropsychiatric improvement independently of age, sex and baseline neuropsychiatric status. Worse pretreatment fatigue and subjective well-being identified those who most likely benefited from treatment. In conclusion, despite its retrospective nature, our study suggests that m/umPEA may improve depression and fatigue in COVID-19 survivors, justifying future research in this setting.",

Thus, a systematic review of the literature was conducted, thoroughly evaluating PEA treatment regimen in decreasing IOP in patients with eye disorders. We checked for articles across the scientific databases Pubmed (MEDLINE), Embase (OVID), and Web of Science from the inception to 30 August 2023, and a total of 828 articles were recovered. Six of these studies (199 patients) were included in the systematic review after the study selection process, and three studies for meta-analysia.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an inflammatory, symptomatic disorder stimulated by antigen-specific immunoglobulin E inflammation in response to allergens. Current treatments include the use of corticosteroids and antihistamines to reduce inflammation by preventing histamine release. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is reported to be an alternative treatment, shown to downregulate mast cell activation and increase the synthesis of endocannabinoid 2-Arachidonoylglycerol to reduce histamine and the symptoms of AR. METHOD: A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial in which 108 participants presenting with seasonal AR were supplemented with either 350 mg of PEA (Levagen+) or a placebo daily for two weeks. Symptom scores were recorded using the reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) twice a day (morning and evening) for the two weeks, and blood was taken at baseline and week 2. RESULTS: 101 participants completed the study with no baseline group differences. No significant difference was seen between groups for allergy symptoms scores (rTNSS) throughout the 14 days of treatment. A sub-group analysis of participants scoring over four (mild-to-moderate) on the total rTNSS at baseline showed that Levagen+ significantly reduced scores compared to the placebo group. Only 36 participants had full sets of blood taken due to COVID-19. The pathology results showed a significant difference in change from baseline between groups. The Levagen+ group had a significant decrease from baseline in histamine, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-α. The placebo group only had a reduction in IL-4. CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that Levagen+ can alleviate AR symptoms, resulting in a reduction in histamine and inflammatory markers.",

Recommended treatment for CME is Amphotericin B (AmpB) and 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC). Though effective, AmpB has displayed numerous adverse side effects due to its potency and nephrotoxicity, prompting investigation into alternative treatments. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an immunomodulatory compound capable of promoting neuroprotection and reducing inflammation. To investigate the efficacy of PEA as a therapeutic alternative for CME, we intracerebrally infected mice with Cn and treated them with PEA or AmpB alone or in combination. Our results demonstrate that PEA alone does not significantly prolong survival nor reduce fungal burden, but when combined with AmpB, PEA exerts an additive effect and promotes both survivability and fungal clearance. However, we compared this combination to traditional AmpB and 5-FC treatment in a survivability study and observed lower efficacy. Overall, our study revealed that PEA alone is not effective as an antifungal agent in the treatment of CME. Importantly, we describe the therapeutic capability of PEA in the context of Cn infection and show that its immunomodulatory properties may confer limited protection when combined with an effective fungicidal agent.",

This disorder has been reported to persist in subsets of patients well after 12 months following infection, significantly affecting their quality of life. Despite the high prevalence of PCOD among patients who suffered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, specific therapeutic strategies are still limited. Among these, emerging evidence seems to indicate the administration of CoUltraPEALut, a combination of micronized Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), an endogenous fatty acid amide, and Luteolin, a natural antioxidant flavonoid, as a viable therapy, especially when given as an adjuvant to olfactory training. Based on the above, a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the literature were conducted, with the aim of evaluating the efficacy of CoUltraPEALut as an addition to olfactory training (OT), in treating PCOD symptoms. Pubmed (MEDLINE), Embase (OVID), and Web of Science scientific databases were screened from the inception until 31 May 2023, and a total of 407 articles were recovered; only five of these studies (441 total patients between treated and control groups) were included in the systematic review. CoUltraPEALut demonstrated significant efficacy in the overall recovery of the olfactory function, compared to the conventional therapy, suggesting that it could represent a possible future adjuvant treatment for PCOD."

      "abstract": "Obesity is associated with gastrointestinal (GI) tract and central nervous system (CNS) disorders. High-fat diet (HFD) feeding-induced obesity in mice induces dysbiosis, causing a shift toward bacteria-derived metabolites with detrimental effects on metabolism and inflammation: events often contributing to the onset and progression of both GI and CNS disorders. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an endogenous lipid mediator with beneficial effects in mouse models of GI and CNS disorders. However, the mechanisms underlining its enteroprotective and neuroprotective effects still need to be fully understood. Here, we aimed to study the effects of PEA on intestinal inflammation and microbiota alterations resulting from lipid overnutrition. Ultramicronized PEA (30 mg/kg/die per os) was administered to HFD-fed mice for 7 weeks starting at the 12th week of HFD regimen. At the termination of the study, the effects of PEA on inflammatory factors and cells, gut microbial features and tryptophan (TRP)-kynurenine metabolism were evaluated. PEA regulates the crosstalk between the host immune system and gut microbiota via rebalancing colonic TRP metabolites. PEA treatment reduced intestinal immune cell recruitment, inflammatory response triggered by HFD feeding, and corticotropin-releasing hormone levels. In particular, PEA modulated HFD-altered TRP metabolism in the colon, rebalancing serotonin (5-HT) turnover and reducing kynurenine levels. These effects were associated with a reshaping of gut microbiota composition through increased butyrate-promoting/producing bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium, Oscillospiraceae and Turicibacter sanguinis, with the latter also described as 5-HT sensor. These data indicate that the rebuilding of gut microbiota following PEA supplementation promotes host 5-HT biosynthesis, which is crucial in regulating intestinal function."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neuropathic mechanisms largely contribute to radicular Low Back Pain (LBP) and an increase in oxidative stress is recognized as one of the possible causes of nerve damage, inducing axonal degeneration and myelin degradation of nerve fibers. OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether a combination of nutraceutical supplements and oxygen-ozone (O2-O3) therapy might reduce disability and improve clinical effects of pharmacological therapy in patients with acute radicular LBP. STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective, open-label, comparative observational study approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Sapienza University of Rome (RS 6285/2021). SETTING: Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Unit of Sant'Andrea Hospital. METHODS: Within the scope of this study, 62 patients with acute radicular LBP diagnosed with disc herniation were assigned into 4 groups. The first group was assigned pharmacological therapy (n = 16), the second group was assigned pharmacological therapy and nutraceutical supplements (n = 15), the third group was assigned pharmacological therapy and O2-O3 therapy (n = 15), and the fourth group was assigned pharmacological therapy, nutraceutical supplements, and O2-O3therapy (n = 16). All patients who participated in the study were evaluated at the beginning of the study, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks (T2) after the beginning of treatment using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and 12-item Short-Form Health Survey. Opioid analgesic intake was noted from baseline to end of treatment (T2). RESULTS: In each group was observed a statistically significant difference for all measures compared to the baseline. At the T2 evaluation time between groups for the Mann-Whitney U test, a statistically significant difference was found: in the ODI scale between groups B and A (P = 0.004), groups C and A (P < 0.001), and groups D and A (P < 0.001); in the NRS-11 between groups B and A (P = 0.017), groups C and A (P = 0.002), and groups D and A (P < 0.001); in the 12-item Physical Component Summary score between groups B and A (P = 0.003), groups C and A (P = 0.002), and groups D and A (P < 0.001), while no significant differences between groups were observed in the 12-item Mental Component Summary score. The average days of opioid usage were similar in the 4 groups (8.33 in group A, 8.33 in group B, 8.33 in group C, and 8.75 in group D). However, the percentage of patients requiring adjuvant opioid therapy differed remarkably: 60% in group A, 40% in group B, 20% in group C, and 25% in group D. LIMITATIONS: A small number of patients were recruited, and we did not perform long-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports a multimodal approach combining nutraceutical supplements and O2-O3 therapy with pharmacological therapy in the treatment of acute radicular LBP secondary to disc herniation. The combination of neurotrophic and antioxidant therapies represents an etiopathogenetic approach, not purely symptomatic, that reduces symptomatology and avoids progression of the nerve damage.",

One brilliant strategy to overcome these issues is the use of drug-loaded microparticles for sustained release, aiming at reducing the frequency of injections. Therefore, the aim of this work was to assess the safety features of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-based, hyaluronic acid-decorated microparticles loaded with palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), citicoline (CIT), or glial-cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Microparticles were prepared by double emulsion-solvent evaporation and fully characterized for their technological features. Microparticles possessed a satisfactory safety profile in vitro on human retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE-19) cells. Interestingly, the administration of free GDNF led to a loss of cell viability, while GDNF sustained release displayed a positive effect in that regard. In vivo results confirmed the safety profile of both empty and loaded microparticles. Overall, the outcomes suggest that the produced microparticles are promising for improving the local administration of neuroprotective molecules. Further studies will be devoted to assess the therapeutic ability of microparticles."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Few evidence-based therapies are available for chronic olfactory dysfunction after COVID-19. This study investigated the relative efficacy of olfactory training alone, co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide with luteolin (um-PEA-LUT, an anti-neuroinflammatory supplement) alone, or combined therapy for treating chronic olfactory dysfunction from COVID-19. METHODS: This double-blinded controlled, placebo-controlled multicenter randomized clinical trial was conducted in 202 patients with persistent COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction of > 6 month duration. After a screening nasal endoscopy, patients were randomized to: (1) olfactory training and placebo; (2) once daily um-PEA-LUT alone; (3) twice daily um-PEA-LUT alone; or (4) combination of once daily um-PEA-LUT with olfactory training. Olfactory testing (Sniffin' Sticks odor identification test) was performed at baseline and at 1, 2, and 3 months. The primary outcome was recovery of over three points on olfactory testing, with outcomes compared at T0, T1, T2 and T3 across groups. Statistical analyses included one-way ANOVA for numeric data and chi-square for nominal data. RESULTS: All patients completed the study, and there were no adverse events. At 90 days, odor identification scores improved by > 3 points in 89.2% of patients receiving combined therapy vs. 36.8% receiving olfactory training with placebo, 40% receiving twice daily um-PEA-LUT alone, and 41.6% receiving once daily um-PEA-LUT alone (p < 0.00001). Patients receiving treatment with um-PEA-LUT alone demonstrated subclinical improvement (< 3 point odor identification improvement) more often than patients receiving olfactory training with placebo (p < 0.0001.) CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory training plus once daily um-PEA-LUT resulted in greater olfactory recovery than either therapy alone in patients with long-term olfactory function due to COVID-19.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of supplementing ongoing pregabalin (PGB) and duloxetine (DLX) treatment with palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) for 24 weeks in FM patients. METHODS: After undergoing three months of stable treatment with DLX+PGB, FM patients were randomised to continue the same treatment (Group 1) or to add PEA 600 mg b.i.d + ALC 500 mg b.i.d. (Group 2) for a further 12 weeks. Every two weeks throughout the study, cumulative disease severity was estimated using the Widespread Pain Index (WPI) as the primary outcome measure; the secondary outcomes were the fortnightly scores of the patient-completed revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR) and the modified Fibromyalgia Assessment Status (FASmod) questionnaire. All three measures were expressed as time-integrated area under the curve (AUC) values. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty (91.5%) of the initial 142 FM patients completed the study: 68 patients in Group 1 and 62 in Group 2. Twenty-four weeks after randomisation, the Group 2 patients showed additional significant improvements in all three outcome measures. Although there was some fluctuation in both groups during the study period, the AUC values of the WPI scores steadily decreased in Group 2 (p=0.048), which also showed better outcomes in terms of the AUC values of the FIQR (p=0.033) and FASmod scores (p=0.017). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first randomised controlled study demonstrating the effectiveness of the adding on therapy of PEA+ALC to DLX+PGB in FM patients.",

The success of therapy depends on the reduction in and management of pain through specific drugs, hence the need to analyze new pain medications with specific activity, which are suitable for long-term use, with a low risk of side effects and interactions with other drugs, and capable of leading to a reduction in orofacial pain. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is a bioactive lipid mediator, which is synthesized in all tissues of the body as a protective pro-homeostatic response to tissue damage and has aroused considerable interest in the dental field due to its anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antimicrobial, antipyretic, antiepileptic, immunomodulatory and neuroprotective activities. It has been observed that PEA could play a role in the management of the pain of orofacial origin, including BMS, OLP, periodontal disease, tongue a la carte and temporomandibular disorders (TMDs), as well as in the treatment of postoperative pain. However, actual clinical data on the use of PEA in the clinical management of patients with orofacial pain are still lacking. Therefore, the main objective of the present study is to provide an overview of orofacial pain in its many manifestations and an updated analysis of the molecular pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory properties of PEA to understand its beneficial effects in the management of patients with orofacial pain, both neuropathic and nociceptive in nature. The aim is also to direct research toward the testing and use of other natural agents that have already been shown to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and pain-relieving actions and could offer important support in the treatment of orofacial pain."

Recommended treatment for CME is Amphotericin B (AmpB) and 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC). Though effective, AmpB has displayed numerous adverse side effects due to its potency and nephrotoxicity, prompting investigation into alternative treatments. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an immunomodulatory compound capable of promoting neuroprotection and reducing inflammation. To investigate the efficacy of PEA as a therapeutic alternative for CME, we intracerebrally infected mice with Cn and treated them with PEA or AmpB alone or in combination. Our results demonstrate that PEA alone does not significantly prolong survival nor reduce fungal burden, but when combined with AmpB, PEA exerts an additive effect and promotes both survivability and fungal clearance. However, we compared this combination to traditional AmpB and 5-FC treatment in a survivability study and observed lower efficacy. Overall, our study revealed that PEA alone is not effective as an antifungal agent in the treatment of CME. Importantly, we describe the therapeutic capability of PEA in the context of Cn infection and show that its immunomodulatory properties may confer limited protection when combined with an effective fungicidal agent."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and analgesics are used frequently by athletes either prophylactically for the prevention of pain, or to accelerate recovery following an injury. However, these types of pain management strategies have been shown to inhibit signalling pathways (e.g., cyclooxygenase-2) that may hinder muscular adaptations such as hypertrophy and strength. Nutraceuticals such as palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) have analgesic properties that act via different mechanisms to NSAIDS/analgesics. Furthermore, PEA has been shown to have a positive effect on sleep and may contribute positively to muscle hypertrophy via PKB activation. Although PEA has not been widely studied in the athletic or recreationally active population, it may provide an alternative solution for pain management if it is found not to interfere with, or enhance training adaptations. Therefore, the study aim is to investigate the effects of daily PEA supplementation (Levagen + ®) with resistance training on lean body mass, strength, power and physical performance and outcomes of recovery (e.g., sleep) compared to placebo. METHODS: This double-blind, randomised controlled study will take place over an 11-week period (including 8-weeks of progressive resistance training). Participants for this study will be 18-35 years old, healthy active adults that are not resistance trained. Participants will attend a familiarisation (week 0), pre-testing (week 1) and final-testing (week 11). At the pre-testing and final-testing weeks, total lean body mass (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; DXA), total mid-thigh cross sectional area (pQCT), maximal muscular strength (1 repetition maximum bench press, isometric mid-thigh pull) and power (countermovement jump and bench throw) will be assessed. Additionally, circulating inflammatory cytokines and anabolic hormones, sleep quality and quantity (ActiGraph), pain and subjective wellbeing (questionnaires) will also be examined. DISCUSSION: This study is designed to investigate the effects that PEA may have on pre-to post intervention changes in total body and regional lean muscle mass, strength, power, sleep, subjective wellbeing, and pain associated with resistance training and menstruation compared with the placebo condition. Unlike other NSAIDs and analgesics, which may inhibit muscle protein synthesis and training adaptations, PEA which provides analgesia via alternative mechanisms may provide an alternative pain management solution. It is therefore important to determine if this analgesic compound interferes with or enhances training adaptations so that athletes and active individuals can make an informed decision on their pain management strategies.

      "abstract": "Chronic pain is a major source of morbidity for which there are limited effective treatments. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), a naturally occurring fatty acid amide, has demonstrated utility in the treatment of neuropathic and inflammatory pain. Emerging reports have supported a possible role for its use in the treatment of chronic pain, although this remains controversial. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the efficacy of PEA as an analgesic agent for chronic pain. A systematic literature search was performed, using the databases MEDLINE and Web of Science, to identify double-blind randomized controlled trials comparing PEA to placebo or active comparators in the treatment of chronic pain. All articles were independently screened by two reviewers. The primary outcome was pain intensity scores, for which a meta-analysis was undertaken using a random effects statistical model. Secondary outcomes including quality of life, functional status, and side effects are represented in a narrative synthesis. Our literature search identified 253 unique articles, of which 11 were ultimately included in the narrative synthesis and meta-analysis. Collectively, these articles described a combined sample size of 774 patients. PEA was found to reduce pain scores relative to comparators in a pooled estimate, with a standard mean difference of 1.68 (95% CI 1.05 to 2.31, p = 0.00001). Several studies reported additional benefits of PEA for quality of life and functional status, and no major side effects were attributed to PEA in any study. The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that PEA is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for chronic pain. Further study is warranted to determine the optimal dosing and administration parameters of PEA for analgesic effects in the context of chronic pain.",

Injury to peripheral nerves in the upper extremities can result in a lifelong reduction in quality of life and a devastating loss of sensory and motor function. Since some standard pharmaceutical therapies can cause dependence or intolerance, nonpharmacological treatments have gained great interest in recent years. In this context, the beneficial effects of a new combination of palmitoylethanolamide and Equisetum arvense L. are evaluated in the present study. The bioavailability of the combination was initially analyzed in a 3D intestinal barrier simulating oral intake to analyze its absorption/biodistribution and exclude cytotoxicity. In a further step, a 3D nerve tissue model was performed to study the biological effects of the combination during the key mechanisms leading to peripheral neuropathy. Our results demonstrate that the combination successfully crossed the intestinal barrier and reached the target site, modulating the nerve recovery mechanism after Schwann cell injury and offering the initial response of relieving pain. This work supported the efficacy of palmitoylethanolamide and Equisetum arvense L. in reducing neuropathy and modifying the major pain mechanisms, outlining a possible alternative nutraceutical approach.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The antinociceptive pharmacological interaction between N-palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and morphine (MOR), as well as gabapentin (GBP), was investigated to obtain synergistic antinociception at doses where side effects were minimal. In addition, the possible antinociceptive mechanism of PEA + MOR or PEA + GBP combinations was explored. METHODS: Individual dose-response curves (DRCs) of PEA, MOR and GBP were evaluated in female mice in which intraplantar nociception was induced with 2% formalin. Isobolographic method was used to detect the pharmacological interaction in the combination of PEA + MOR or PEA + GBP. KEY FINDINGS: The ED50 was calculated from the DRC; the order of potency was MOR > PEA > GBP. The isobolographic analysis was obtained at a 1:1 ratio to determine the pharmacological interaction. The experimental values of flinching (PEA + MOR, Zexp = 2.72 ± 0.2 μg/paw and PEA + GBP Zexp = 2.77 ± 0.19 μg/paw) were significantly lower than those calculated theoretically (PEA + MOR Zadd = 7.78 ± 1.07 and PEA + GBP Zadd = 24.05 ± 1.91 μg/paw), resulting in synergistic antinociception. Pretreatment with GW6471 and naloxone demonstrated that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and opioid receptors are involved in both interactions. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that MOR and GBP synergistically enhance PEA-induced antinociception through PPARα and opioid receptor mechanisms. Furthermore, the results suggest that combinations containing PEA with MOR or GBP could be of interest in aiding the treatment of inflammatory pain.",

      "abstract": "Urothelial inflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of chronic pelvic pain due to its origin in the bladder. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a patent-pending formulation (Pelvipea®) composed of micronized palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), hempseed oil, and maritime pine bark dry extract in reducing urothelial inflammation, as well as the effect of each ingredient individually, in order to define the synergistic effect of the three ingredients. An in vitro bladder urothelium model composed of the T24 cell line was exposed to a conditioned media obtained by treating macrophage-differentiated THP-1 cells with different concentrations of the functional ingredients and a mixture of them in the presence of the pro-inflammatory stimulus of Escherichia coli. Cells exposed only to the inflammatory stimulus in the absence of pre-treatment were considered as a positive control for inflammation. The impact of each functional ingredient and their mixture on inflammation was evaluated by the determination of transcription factor NF-kB and of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Statistical analysis was performed using the t-test, comparing the mixture and the single ingredients for every condition tested. All results were reported as fold change (mean ± standard deviation), the ratio between the values obtained from the respective treatments for inflammation control. The three functional ingredients did not induce negative effects on THP-1 cell vitality. The levels of NF-kB were reduced following treatment with hempseed oil, maritime pine bark dry extract, and the mixture at all tested concentrations, and with micronized PEA from 25 to 200 μg/mL. Treatment with the mixture resulted in the lowest expression levels of interleukins (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 compared to the single functional ingredients at a concentration of 230 μg/mL, with values of 0.08 (±0.00), 0.01 (±0.00), and 0.32 (±0.01), respectively. The mixture of micronized PEA, hempseed oil, and maritime pine bark dry extract (Pelvipea®) at 230 μg/mL showed the best efficacy in urothelial IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 reduction compared with the singular components. This formulation may represent a promising therapeutic option to relieve painful symptoms originating in the bladder. However, in vivo studies are needed to confirm these results.",

      "abstract": "AIM: To study the effect of palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) on apoptosis of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells induced by all-trans retinal (atRAL) and to explore the possible molecular mechanism. METHODS: CellTiter 96® Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS) was used to detect the effect of PEA on human-derived retinal epithelial cells (ARPE-19) viability induced by atRAL. A Leica DMi8 inverted microscope was used to observe cell morphology. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was evaluated with 2',7'-dichlorodihydrof-luorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) staining and fluorescence microscopy. Expression of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK), c-Jun, phosphorylated c-Jun (p-c-Jun), Bak, cleaved caspase-3, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), and binding (Bip) protein levels were tested by Western blot. Abca4 -/- Rdh8 -/- mice, mouse models of atRAL clearance defects which displays some symbolic characteristics of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and Stargardt disease (STGD1). In the animal models, PEA was injected intraperitoneally. The full-field electroretinogram was used to detect visual function under scotopic conditions traced from mice. Optical coherence tomography showed reconstitution or thickening of the retinal pigment epithelium layer. Effect of PEA on fundus injury induced by light in Abca4-/-Rdh8-/- mice was observed by fundus photography. RESULTS: PEA ameliorated ARPE-19 cells apoptosis and inhibited ROS (including mitochondrial ROS) production induced by atRAL. PEA improved the retinal functional, prohibited both RPE and photoreceptor from death, ameliorates light-induced fundus impairment in Abca4 -/- Rdh8 -/- mice. In vitro and in vivo, PEA inhibited JNK, p-JNK, c-Jun, p-c-Jun, Bak, cleaved caspase-3, CHOP, and Bip protein levels induced by all-trans retinal in ARPE-19 cells. CONCLUSION: PEA has effect on treating RPE cells apoptosis in retinopathy caused by atRAL accumulation. PEA is a potential treatment strategy for dry AMD and STGD1. The molecular mechanism is affecting the ROS-JNK-CHOP signaling pathway partly."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Human amniotic and amniochorionic membranes (AM, ACM) represent the most often used grafts accelerating wound healing. Palmitoylethanolamide, oleoylethanolamide and anandamide are endogenous bioactive lipid molecules, generally referred as N-acylethanolamines. They express analgesic, nociceptive, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. We assessed the distribution of these lipid mediators in placental tissues, as they could participate on analgesic and wound healing effect of AM/ACM grafts. METHODS: Seven placentas were collected after caesarean delivery and fresh samples of AM, ACM, placental disc, umbilical cord, umbilical serum and vernix caseosa, and decontaminated samples (antibiotic solution BASE 128) of AM and ACM have been prepared. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used for N-acylethanolamines analysis. RESULTS: N-acylethanolamines were present in all studied tissues, palmitoylethanolamide being the most abundant and the anandamide the least. For palmitoylethanolamide the maximum average concentration was detected in AM (350.33 ± 239.26 ng/g), while oleoylethanolamide and anandamide were most abundant in placenta (219.08 ± 79.42 ng/g and 30.06 ± 7.77 ng/g, respectively). Low levels of N-acylethanolamines were found in serum and vernix. A significant increase in the levels of N-acylethanolamines (3.1-3.6-fold, P < 0.001) was observed in AM when the tissues were decontaminated using antibiotic solution. The increase in decontaminated ACM was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of N-acylethanolamines, particularly palmitoylethanolamide in AM and ACM allows us to propose these lipid mediators as the likely factors responsible for the anti-hyperalgesic, but also anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective, effects of AM/ACM grafts in wound healing treatment. The increase of N-acylethanolamines levels in AM and ACM after tissue decontamination indicates that tissue processing is an important factor in maintaining the analgesic effect.",

      "abstract": "Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common side effect of several chemotherapeutic agents, such as Paclitaxel. The main symptoms of CIPN are pain and numbness in the hands and feet. Paclitaxel is believed to accumulate in the dorsal root ganglia and free nerve endings. Novel therapeutic agents might help to mitigate or prevent Paclitaxel toxicity on dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Thus, we used primary DRG neurons as a model to investigate the potential neuroprotective effects of the endocannabinoid-like substance, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA). DRG neurons were isolated from cervical to sacral segments of spinal nerves of Wister rats (6-8 weeks old). After isolation and purification of neuronal cell populations, different concentrations of Paclitaxel (0.01-10 µM) or PEA (0.1-10 µM) or their combination were tested on cell viability by MTT assay at 24 h, 48, and 72 h post-treatment. Furthermore, morphometric analyses of neurite length and soma size for DRG neurons were performed. Adverse Paclitaxel effects on cell viability were apparent at 72 h post-treatment whereas Paclitaxel significantly reduced the neurite length in a concentration-dependent manner nearly at all investigated time points. However, Paclitaxel significantly increased the size of neuronal cell bodies at all time windows. These phenotypic effects were significantly reduced in neurons additionally treated with PEA, indicating the neuroprotective effect of PEA. PEA alone led to a significant increase in neuron viability regardless of PEA concentrations, apparent improvements in neurite outgrowth as well as a significant decrease in soma size of neurons at different investigated time points. Taken together, PEA showed promising protective effects against Paclitaxel-related toxicity on DRG neurons.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies showed that patients with cognitive dysfunction and fatigue after COVID-19 exhibit impaired cortical GABAB-ergic activity, as revealed by reduced long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI). Aim of this study was to test the effects of co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide/luteolin (PEA-LUT), an endocannabinoid-like mediator able to enhance GABA-ergic transmission and to reduce neuroinflammation, on LICI. METHODS: Thirty-nine patients (26 females, mean age 49.9 ± 11.4 years, mean time from infection 296.7 ± 112.3 days) suffering from persistent cognitive difficulties and fatigue after mild COVID-19 were randomly assigned to receive either PEA-LUT 700 mg + 70 mg or PLACEBO, administered orally bid for eight weeks. The day before (PRE) and at the end of the treatment (POST), they underwent TMS protocols to assess LICI. We further evaluate short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) and long-term potentiation (LTP)-like cortical plasticity. RESULTS: Patients treated with PEA-LUT but not with PLACEBO showed a significant increase of LICI and LTP-like cortical plasticity. SAI remained unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: Eight weeks of treatment with PEA-LUT restore GABAB activity and cortical plasticity in long Covid patients. SIGNIFICANCE: This study confirms altered physiology of the motor cortex in long COVID-19 syndrome and indicates PEA-LUT as a candidate for the treatment of this post-viral condition.",

Its broad-spectrum analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects make PEA an interesting substance in pain management. However, the underlying analgetic mechanisms have not yet been investigated in humans. The aim of our study is to provide a deeper understanding of the involved mechanisms, which is essential for differentiating therapeutic approaches and the establishment of mechanism-based therapeutic approaches. In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded crossover trial, 14 healthy volunteers were included. PEA (3 × 400 mg per day) or placebo were taken for 4 weeks. Our study investigated the mode of action of PEA using an established pain model, \"Repetitive phasic heat application\", which is well-suited to investigate analgesic and anti-hyperalgesic effects in healthy volunteers. Parameters for peripheral and central sensitization as well as for pain modulation were assessed. Repetitive heat pain was significantly decreased, and the cold pain tolerance was significantly prolonged after the PEA treatment. The pressure pain tolerance and the conditioned pain modulation were increased after the PEA treatment. The wind-up ratio and the average distance of allodynia were significantly decreased after the PEA treatment. The heat pain tolerance was significantly higher after the PEA treatment. The present study has demonstrated that PEA has clinically relevant analgesic properties, acting on both peripheral and central mechanisms as well as in pain modulation.",

This study aimed to evaluate PEA effects on the immature-brain, i.e., early neuroprotection by PEA in an experimental PA paradigm. Newborn rats were placed in a 37°C water bath for 19 min to induce PA. PEA 10 mg/kg, s.c., was administered within the first hour of life. Neurobehavioral responses were assessed from postnatal day 1 (P1) to postnatal day 21 (P21), recording the day of appearance of several reflexes and neurological signs. Hippocampal CA1 area ultrastructure was examined using electron microscopy. Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2), phosphorylated high and medium molecular weight neurofilaments (pNF H/M), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were assessed using immunohistochemistry and Western blot at P21. Over the first 3 weeks of life, PA rats showed late gait, negative geotaxis and eye-opening onset, and delayed appearance of air-righting, auditory startle, sensory eyelid, forelimb placing, and grasp reflexes. On P21, the hippocampal CA1 area showed signs of neuronal degeneration and MAP-2 deficit. PEA treatment reduced PA-induced hippocampal damage and normalized the time of appearance of gait, air-righting, placing, and grasp reflexes. The outcome of this study might prove useful in designing intervention strategies to reduce early neurodevelopmental delay following PA."

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine the effects of a novel food supplement, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), specifically Levagen+, as compared with a placebo on proinflammatory biomarkers in adults recently diagnosed with COVID-19 who were unvaccinated and nonhospitalized. METHODS: This study was a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial conducted October 2020-March 2021 (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04912921). Participants aged 19-53 y were unvaccinated and recently infected with COVID-19 as indicated by a positive test result per RT-PCR or antigen test, and they reported to the test site following diagnosis as allowed by the CDC's return-to-work policy. Participants were stratified by age, sex, and BMI and randomly assigned by coin toss to receive 600 mg Levagen+ twice daily (LEV) or placebo tablets twice daily (CON) for 4 wk. At baseline and week 4, participants completed health histories, 24-h dietary recalls, anthropometrics, and nonfasting blood sampling. The primary outcomes were the 4-wk change between groups for IL-6, C-reactive protein, ferritin, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin), and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio. Multiple linear regression models were utilized to assess treatment effects on outcomes, adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: A total of 60 participants completed the study (LEV: n = 30; CON: n = 30). After 4 wk of supplementation, sP-selectin (β = -11.5; 95% CI: -19.8, -3.15; P = 0.0078), IL-1β (β = -22.9; 95% CI: -42.4, -3.40; P = 0.0222), and IL-2 (β = -1.73; 95% CI: -3.45, -0.065; P = 0.0492) concentrations were significantly reduced in the LEV group compared with the CON group. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory mechanisms are crucial to optimal resolution of infectious conditions, yet unchecked secretion of inflammatory mediators can promote the dysregulated immune response implicated in COVID-19 complications. Overall, PEA supplementation produced anti-inflammatory effects in individuals recently diagnosed with COVID-19 who were nonhospitalized.",

OBJECTIVE: This study explored the safety, tolerability and efficacy of a palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) formulation in treating diabetic-related peripheral neuropathic pain (PNP). Secondary outcomes included systemic inflammation, sleep and mood changes in patients diagnosed with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and PNP. DESIGN: This study was a single-centre, quadruple-blinded, placebo-controlled trial with 70 participants receiving 600 mg of PEA or placebo daily, for 8 weeks, with a 94% rate of study participation completion. Primary outcomes were neuropathic pain and specific pain types (the BPI-DPN and NPSI). The secondary outcomes were sleep quality (MOS sleep scale), mood (DASS-21), glucose metabolism and inflammation. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction (P ≤ 0.001) in BPI-DPN total pain and pain interference, NPSI total score and sub-scores, except for evoked pain (P = 0.09) in the PEA group compared with the placebo group. The MOS sleep problem index and sub-scores significantly improved (P ≤ 0.001). DASS-21 depression scores significantly reduced (P = 0.03), but not anxiety or stress scores. Interleukin-6 and elevated C-reactive protein levels significantly reduced in the PEA group (P = 0.05), with no differences in fibrinogen between groups (P = 0.78) at treatment completion. There were no changes in safety pathology parameters, and the treatment was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that the PEA formulation reduced diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain and inflammation along with improving mood and sleep. Further studies on the mechanistic effectiveness of PEA as an adjunct medicine and as a monotherapy pain analgesic are warranted.

Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) has been demonstrated to improve pain in preclinical contexts, but an appraisal of clinical evidence is still lacking. The present study aimed at addressing the working hypothesis for the efficacy of PEA for nociceptive musculoskeletal and neuropathic pain in the clinical setting. The systematic search, selection and analysis were performed in agreement with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 recommendations. The primary outcome was pain reduction, as measured by a pain assessment scale. The secondary outcome was improvement in quality of life and/or of parameters of function. The results obtained for a total of 933 patients demonstrate the efficacy of PEA over the control (p < 0.00001), in particular in six studies apart from the two randomized, double-blind clinical trials included. However, the results are downgraded due to the high heterogeneity of the studies (I2 = 99%), and the funnel plot suggests publication bias. Efficacy in achieving a reduction in the need for rescue medications and improvement in functioning, neuropathic symptoms and quality of life are reported. Therefore, adequately powered randomized, double-blind clinical trials are needed to deepen the domains of efficacy of add-on therapy with PEA for chronic pain.

Patients with long COVID olfactory dysfunction were allocated to different groups based on the presence (\"previously treated\") or absence (\"naïve\") of prior exposure to olfactory training. Patients were then randomized to receive PEA-LUT alone or in combination with olfactory training. Olfactory function and memory were assessed at monthly intervals using self-report measures and quantitative thresholds. A total of 69 patients (43 women, 26 men) with an age average of 40.6 + 10.5 were recruited. PEA-LUT therapy was associated with a significant improvement in validated odor identification scores at the baseline versus each subsequent month; assessment at 3 months showed an average improvement of 10.7 + 2.6, CI 95%: 6-14 (p < 0.0001). The overall prevalence of parosmia was 79.7% (55 patients), with a significant improvement from the baseline to 3 months (p < 0.0001), namely in 31 patients from the Naïve 1 group (72%), 15 from the Naïve 2 group (93.7%), and 9 from the remaining group (90%). Overall, mental clouding was detected in 37.7% (26 subjects) of the cases, with a reduction in severity from the baseline to three months (p = 0.02), namely in 15 patients from the Naïve 1 group (34.8%), 7 from the Naïve 2 group (43.7%), and 4 from the remaining group (40%). Conclusions. In patients with long COVID and chronic olfactory loss, a regimen including oral PEA-LUT and olfactory training ameliorated olfactory dysfunction and memory. Further investigations are necessary to discern biomarkers, mechanisms, and long-term outcomes.",

The present study sought to assess the efficacy and tolerability of Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) adjunctive therapy in treatment of negative symptoms in patients with stable schizophrenia. METHODS: This 8-week (trial timepoints: baseline, week 4, week 8), double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial randomized patients with schizophrenia in a 1:1 ratio to compare the efficacy and safety of 600 mg twice a day of PEA and matched placebo alongside a stable dose of risperidone. Outcome measures were the positive and the negative syndrome scale (PANSS), the extrapyramidal symptom rating scale (ESRS), and the Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS). The primary outcome was change in the negative subscale score during the trial period between the groups. Safety of interventions were controlled and addressed during the trial. RESULTS: A total of 50 participants completed the trial (25 in each group). Baseline characteristics of the groups were comparable (p>0.05). There was significant effect from time-treatment interaction on negative symptoms (p = 0.012) suggesting greater symptom improvement in the PEA group. In contrast, the longitudinal changes in positive symptoms and depressive symptoms were similar between groups (p values>0.05). Safety assessments showed no significant difference regarding extrapyramidal symptoms, measured by ESRS, and also frequency of other complications between PEA and placebo groups (p values>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive therapy with PEA and risperidone alleviates schizophrenia-related primary negative symptoms in a safe manner.",

The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the potential efficacy of PEA in the treatment of long COVID. Patients attending the Neurological Out Clinic of the IRCCS Centro Neurolesi Bonino-Pulejo (Messina, Italy) from August 2020 to September 2021 were screened for potential inclusion in the study. We included only long COVID patients who were treated with PEA 600 mg two times daily for about 3 months. All patients performed the post-COVID-19 Functional Status (PCFS) scale. Thirty-three patients (10 males, 43.5%, mean age 47.8 ± 12.4) were enrolled in the study. Patients were divided into two groups based on hospitalization or home care observation. A substantial difference in the PCFS score between the two groups at baseline and after treatment with PEA were found. We found that smoking was a risk factor with an odds ratio of 8.13 CI 95% [0.233, 1.167]. Our findings encourage the use of PEA as a potentially effective therapy in patients with long COVID.",

We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of palmitoylethanolamide combination therapy in acute mania. METHODS: Patients in the acute phase of mania were assigned into two parallel groups given either lithium (blood level of 0.8-1.1 mEq/L) and risperidone 3 mg plus palmitoylethanolamide 600 mg or placebo twice per day for 6 weeks. All participants were assessed with the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), and Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) at baseline and at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6. RESULTS: A total of 63 patients (32 in palmitoylethanolamide and 31 in placebo groups) completed the trial. We found a significant effect for time×treatment interaction on the YMRS score (F = 5.22, d.f. = 2.34, P= 0.004) from baseline to study end point. Results from independent t test showed a significantly greater decrease in YMRS scores in the palmitoylethanolamide group, compared with the placebo group, from baseline to weeks 4 and 6 (P= 0.018 and P= 0.002, respectively). There was no significant difference between palmitoylethanolamide and placebo groups based on ESRS scores or ESRS changes in scores (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide preliminary evidence that palmitoylethanolamide is an effective adjunctive medication that improves manic symptoms and overall clinical status in acute episodes of mania. However, larger sample sizes and more extended follow-up therapy are needed in future studies to confirm our findings.",

Mitochondrial bioenergetics, ATP homeostasis, and magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance spectroscopy were evaluated in the frontal cortex (FC) and hippocampus (HIPP) at the end of um-PEA treatment. Glutamate release was investigated by in vivo microdialysis in the ventral HIPP (vHIPP). We demonstrated that chronic um-PEA treatment ameliorates the decrease in the complex-I respiration rate and the FoF1-ATPase (complex V) activity, as well as ATP content depletion in the cortical mitochondria. Otherwise, the impairment in mitochondrial bioenergetics and the release of glutamate after depolarization was not ameliorated by um-PEA treatment in the HIPP of both young and adult 3 × Tg-AD mice. Moreover, progressive age- and pathology-related changes were observed in the cortical and hippocampal metabolism that closely mimic the alterations observed in the human AD brain; these metabolic alterations were not affected by chronic um-PEA treatment. These findings confirm that the HIPP is the most affected area by AD-like pathology and demonstrate that um-PEA counteracts mitochondrial dysfunctions and helps rescue brain energy metabolism in the FC, but not in the HIPP."

      "abstract": "Lipids play a crucial role in the entry and egress of viruses, regardless of whether they are naked or enveloped. Recent evidence shows that lipid involvement in viral infection goes much further. During replication, many viruses rearrange internal lipid membranes to create niches where they replicate and assemble. Because of the close connection between lipids and inflammation, the derangement of lipid metabolism also results in the production of inflammatory stimuli. Due to its pivotal function in the viral life cycle, lipid metabolism has become an area of intense research to understand how viruses seize lipids and to design antiviral drugs targeting lipid pathways. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is a lipid-derived peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α) agonist that also counteracts SARS-CoV-2 entry and its replication. Our work highlights for the first time the antiviral potency of PEA against SARS-CoV-2, exerting its activity by two different mechanisms. First, its binding to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein causes a drop in viral infection of ~70%. We show that this activity is specific for SARS-CoV-2, as it does not prevent infection by VSV or HSV-2, other enveloped viruses that use different glycoproteins and entry receptors to mediate their entry. Second, we show that in infected Huh-7 cells, treatment with PEA dismantles lipid droplets, preventing the usage of these vesicular bodies by SARS-CoV-2 as a source of energy and protection against innate cellular defenses. This is not surprising since PEA activates PPAR-α, a transcription factor that, once activated, generates a cascade of events that leads to the disruption of fatty acid droplets, thereby bringing about lipid droplet degradation through β-oxidation. In conclusion, the present work demonstrates a novel mechanism of action for PEA as a direct and indirect antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2. This evidence reinforces the notion that treatment with this compound might significantly impact the course of COVID-19. Indeed, considering that the protective effects of PEA in COVID-19 are the current objectives of two clinical trials (NCT04619706 and NCT04568876) and given the relative lack of toxicity of PEA in humans, further preclinical and clinical tests will be needed to fully consider PEA as a promising adjuvant therapy in the current COVID-19 pandemic or against emerging RNA viruses that share the same route of replication as coronaviruses.",

PEA belonging to the N-acetylanolamine class of phospholipids was first isolated from soy lecithin, egg yolk, and peanut flour. It is currently used for the treatment of different types of neuropathic pain, such as fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, and many other conditions. The properties of PEA, especially of its micronized or ultra-micronized forms maximizing bioavailability and efficacy, have sparked a series of innovative research to evaluate its possible application as therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases are widespread throughout the world, and although they are numerous and different, they share common patterns of conditions that result from progressive damage to the brain areas involved in mobility, muscle coordination and strength, mood, and cognition. The present review is aimed at illustrating in vitro and in vivo research, as well as human studies, using PEA treatment, alone or in combination with other compounds, in the presence of neurodegeneration. Namely, attention has been paid to the effects of PEA in counteracting neuroinflammatory conditions and in slowing down the progression of diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Frontotemporal dementia, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Multiple Sclerosis. Literature research demonstrated the efficacy of PEA in addressing the damage typical of major neurodegenerative diseases.",

METHODS: A pilot, prospective, open-label experimental study was designed in which patients with episodic migraine with and without aura seen in the general practice office of a tertiary centre during a period of 6 month were offered the possibility to participate. No control group was included. All included patients were treated with nutraceutical Calmux® taken every 12 h for 3 months. Monthly attack frequency, attack intensity, impact of migraine (HIT-6 and MIDAS scales) and quality of sleep at baseline and after 3 months of treatment were compared. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (22 women and 3 men) were included, with a mean age of 36.3 ± 12 years. Headache days per month decreased from 10 ± 2.1 days to 6.6 ± 3.6 days (p < 0.00001). Days of analgesic use decreased from 9.2 ± 2.6 days to 4.1 ± 2.1 (p < 0.0001). None of the patients included suffered from adverse events attributable to treatment. Pain intensity showed a mean reduction of 3.1 points, from 8.1 at baseline to 5 at 3 months of treatment (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: PEA nutraceuticals could be useful in migraine prevention. Further studies are necessary, but we consider that PEA-based nutraceutical could be a new approach in the treatment of migraine patients.",

METHODS: We enrolled 318 patients with the neuroradiological diagnosis of disc herniation performed with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and symptoms characterized by low back pain complicated by sciatica, which we divided into two groups. Group A was composed of 165 patients who were treated only with oxygen-ozone therapy with CT-guided intraforaminal technique, while the remaining 153 (Group B) have undergone combined oral treatment with ALA + PEA and myrrh. Follow-up visits for the evaluation of the clinical outcome of the treatment were conducted after 60 ± 8 days using a modified version of McNab's method. RESULTS: At the clinical check-up, 126/165 patients included in Group A had a complete remission of pain (76.4%), while in Group B, 119/153 (77.8%) had a complete remission of pain. CONCLUSION: The results highlight how the treatment associated with ozone therapy and oral administration of alpha-lipoic acid + palmitoylethanolamide and myrrh is preferred over the simple treatment with only ozone in such patients in the phase of greatest acuity of the disease, where the pain appears to be better controlled.",

Here, we report that palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), an endogenous N-acylethanolamine, can suppress the inflammation induced by Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling both in vitro and in vivo. PEA was found to be significantly reduced in the serum and spleen of lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice analyzed by lipidomics. PEA suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine production in a mouse macrophage cell line stimulated with TLR ligands such as lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan, poly (I:C), imiquimod, and CpG-ODN. PEA also inhibited both mRNA and protein levels of IL-6 in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and B cells stimulated with CpG-ODN. Augmentation of cell surface CD86 and CD40 on BMDCs and B cells, IgM production, and cell proliferation of B cells in response to CpG-ODN were attenuated by PEA. Moreover, PEA treatment significantly reduced mortality and serum IL-6 levels in mice injected with CpG-ODN plus D-galactosamine. Taken together, PEA ameliorates inflammation induced by TLR signaling, which could be a novel therapeutic target for inflammatory disorders.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Olfactory training is the only evidence-based treatment for post-viral olfactory dysfunction. Smell disorders after SARS-CoV-2 infection have been attributed to neuroinflammatory events within the olfactory bulb and the central nervous system. Therefore, targeting neuroinflammation is one potential strategy for promoting recovery from post-COVID-19 chronic olfactory dysfunction. Palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin (PEA-LUT) are candidate antiinflammatory/ neuroprotective agents. OBJECTIVE: To investigate recovery of olfactory function in patients treated with PEA-LUT oral supplements plus olfactory training versus olfactory training plus placebo. METHODS: Multicenter double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial was held. Eligible subjects had prior COVID-19 and persistent olfactory impairment >6 months after follow-up SARS-CoV-2 negative testing, without prior history of olfactory dysfunction or other sinonasal disorders. Participants were randomized to daily oral supplementation with ultramicronized PEA-LUT 770 mg plus olfactory training (intervention group) or olfactory training with placebo (control). Sniffin' Sticks assessments were used to test the patients at baseline and 90 days. RESULTS: A total of 185 patients, including intervention (130) and control (55) were enrolled. The intervention group showed significantly greater improvement in olfactory threshold, discrimination, and identification scores compared to controls (p=0.0001). Overall, 92% of patients in the intervention group improved versus 42% of controls. Magnitude of recovery was significantly greater in the intervention group versus control (12.8 + 8.2 versus mean 3.2 + 3), with >10-fold higher prevalence of anosmia in control versus intervention groups at the 90-day endpoint. CONCLUSION: Among individuals with olfactory dysfunction post-COVID-19, combining PEA-LUT with olfactory training resulted in greater recovery of smell than olfactory training alone.",

      "abstract": "COVID-19 is highly transmissive and contagious disease with a wide spectrum of clinicopathological issues, including respiratory, vasculo-coagulative, and immune disorders. In some cases of COVID-19, patients can be characterized by clinical sequelae with mild-to-moderate symptoms that persist long after the resolution of the acute infection, known as long-COVID, potentially affecting their quality of life. The main symptoms of long-COVID include persistent dyspnea, fatigue and weakness (that are typically out of proportion, to the degree of ongoing lung damage and gas exchange impairment), persistence of anosmia and dysgeusia, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and cognitive dysfunctions (such as brain fog or memory lapses). The appropriate management and prevention of potential long-COVID sequelae is still lacking. It is also believed that long-term symptoms of COVID-19 are related to an immunity over-response, namely a cytokine storm, involving the release of pro-inflammatory interleukins, monocyte chemoattractant proteins, and tissue necrosis factors. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) shows affinity for vanilloid receptor 1 and for cannabinoid-like G protein-coupled receptors, enhancing anandamide activity by means of an entourage effect. Due to its anti-inflammatory properties, PEA has been recently used as an early add-on therapy for respiratory problems in patients with COVID-19. It is believed that PEA mitigates the cytokine storm modulating cell-mediated immunity, as well as counteracts pain and oxidative stress. In this article, we theorize that PEA could be a potentially effective nutraceutical to treat long-COVID, with regard to fatigue and myalgia, where a mythocondrial dysfunction is hypothesizable."

The first group received oral supplementation based on um-PEA at a dose of 1800 mg/day for a total of 28 days; the second group was the control group (R.S. 73.20). At baseline (T0) and after 28 days of um-PEA treatment (T1), we monitored: routine laboratory parameters, inflammatory and oxidative stress (OS) biomarkers, lymphocytes subpopulation and COVID-19 serological response. At T1, the um-PEA-treated group presented a significant reduction in inflammation compared to the control group (CRP p = 0.007; IL-6 p = 0.0001; neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio p = 0.044). At T1, the controls showed a significant increase in OS compared to the treated group (FORT p = 0.05). At T1, the um-PEA group exhibited a significant decrease in D-dimer levels (p = 0.0001) and higher levels of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 (p = 0.0001) compared to the controls. Our data demonstrated, in a randomized clinical trial, the beneficial effects of um-PEA in both asymptomatic and mild-symptomatic patients related to reductions in inflammatory state, OS and coagulative cascade alterations."

      "abstract": "High-fat diet (HFD) consumption leads to obesity and a chronic state of low-grade inflammation, named metainflammation. Notably, metainflammation contributes to neuroinflammation due to the increased levels of circulating free fatty acids and cytokines. It indicates a strict interplay between peripheral and central counterparts in the pathogenic mechanisms of obesity-related mood disorders. In this context, the impairment of internal hypothalamic circuitry runs in tandem with the alteration of other brain areas associated with emotional processing (i.e., hippocampus and amygdala). Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), an endogenous lipid mediator belonging to the N-acylethanolamines family, has been extensively studied for its pleiotropic effects both at central and peripheral level. Our study aimed to elucidate PEA capability in limiting obesity-induced anxiety-like behavior and neuroinflammation-related features in an experimental model of HFD-fed obese mice. PEA treatment promoted an improvement in anxiety-like behavior of obese mice and the systemic inflammation, reducing serum pro-inflammatory mediators (i.e., TNF-α, IL-1β, MCP-1, LPS). In the amygdala, PEA increased dopamine turnover, as well as GABA levels. PEA also counteracted the overactivation of HPA axis, reducing the expression of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone and its type 1 receptor. Moreover, PEA attenuated the immunoreactivity of Iba-1 and GFAP and reduced pro-inflammatory pathways and cytokine production in both the hypothalamus and hippocampus. This finding, together with the reduced transcription of mast cell markers (chymase 1 and tryptase β2) in the hippocampus, indicated the weakening of immune cell activation underlying the neuroprotective effect of PEA. Obesity-driven neuroinflammation was also associated with the disruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB) in the hippocampus. PEA limited the albumin extravasation and restored tight junction transcription modified by HFD. To gain mechanistic insight, we designed an in vitro model of metabolic injury using human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells insulted by a mix of glucosamine and glucose. Here, PEA directly counteracted inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction in a PPAR-α-dependent manner since the pharmacological blockade of the receptor reverted its effects. Our results strengthen the therapeutic potential of PEA in obesity-related neuropsychiatric comorbidities, controlling neuroinflammation, BBB disruption, and neurotransmitter imbalance involved in behavioral dysfunctions.",

This axial postural deformity is common in Parkinson's disease (PD), with prevalence ranging from 3 to 18 percent; it is generally associated with a more severe disease and longer duration of symptoms. Camptocormia in PD typically responds poorly to levodopa. Other treatment options are limited and are often not effective. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe an unusual case of PD presenting with camptocormia that only emerged during the \"off\" state of PD. The patient was treated with classical dopaminergic anti-Parkinson's therapy plus a new formulation of palmitoylethanolamide co-ultramicronized with luteolin (Lut) termed um-PEALut. We observed that the addition of um-PEALut to acute treatment with carbidopa/levodopa resulted in improved dyskinesia and reduced camptocormia. The patient continued treatment for four months, resulting in a complete resolution of leg and trunk dyskinesia and a marked reduction in the onset of camptocormia during the \"off\" states. CONCLUSION: um-PEALut shows potential as an efficacious adjuvant therapy for patients with PD receiving carbidopa/levodopa to treat both dyskinesia and camptocormia in acute and chronic fashion."

In search for better-tolerated antiseizure agents, cannabinoid compounds and other N-acylethanolamines not directly binding cannabinoid receptors have drawn significant attention. Among these, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) has shown neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic properties. All studies examining PEA's role in epilepsy and acute seizures were systematically reviewed. Preclinical studies indicated a systematically reduced PEA tone accompanied by alterations of endocannabinoid levels. PEA supplementation reduced seizure frequency and severity in animal models of epilepsy and acute seizures, in some cases, similarly to available antiseizure medications but with a better safety profile. The peripheral-brain immune system seemed to be more effectively modulated by subchronic pretreatment with PEA, with positive consequences in terms of better responding to subsequent epileptogenic insults. PEA treatment restored the endocannabinoid level changes that occur in a seizure episode, with potential preventive implications in terms of neural damage. Neurobiological mechanisms for PEA antiseizure effect seemed to include the activation of the endocannabinoid system and the modulation of neuroinflammation and excitotoxicity. Although no human study was identified, there is ground for testing the antiseizure potential of PEA and its safety profile in human studies of epilepsy."

      "abstract": "Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has become one of the serious causes of chronic liver diseases, characterized by hepatic steatosis, hepatocellular injury, inflammation and fibrosis, and lack of efficient therapeutic agents. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an endogenous bioactive lipid with various pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and neuroprotective effects. However, the effect of PEA on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is still unknown. Our study aims to explore the potential protective role of PEA on NASH and to reveal the underlying mechanism. In this study, the C57BL/6 mice were used to establish the NASH model through methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet feeding. Here, we found that PEA treatment significantly improved liver function, alleviated hepatic pathological changes, and attenuated the lipid accumulation and hepatic fibrosis in NASH mice induced by MCD diet feeding. Mechanistically, the anti-steatosis effect of PEA may be due to the suppressed expression of ACC1 and CD36, elevated expression of PPAR-α, and the phosphorylation levels of AMPK. In addition, hepatic oxidative stress was greatly inhibited in MCD-fed mice treated with PEA via enhancing the expression and activities of antioxidant enzymes, including GSH-px and SOD. Moreover, PEA exerted a clear anti-inflammatory effect though ameliorating the expression of inflammatory mediators and suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway activation. Furthermore, the impaired autophagy in MCD-induced mice was reactivated with PEA treatment. Taken together, our research suggested that PEA protects against NASH through the inhibition of inflammation and restoration of autophagy. Thus, PEA may represent an efficient therapeutic agent to treat NASH."

However, its effects on enteric inflammation and colonic dysmotility associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are lacking. This study was designed to investigate the beneficial effect of PEA administration in counteracting the enteric inflammation and relieving the bowel motor dysfunctions in an AD mouse model, SAMP8 mice. In addition, the ability of PEA in modulating the activation of enteric glial cells (EGCs), pivotally involved in the pathophysiology of bowel dysfunctions associated with inflammatory conditions, has also been examined. SAMP8 mice at 4 months of age were treated orally with PEA (5 mg/kg/day) for 2 months. SAMR1 animals were employed as controls. At the end of treatment, parameters dealing with colonic motility, inflammation, barrier integrity and AD protein accumulation were evaluated. The effect of PEA on EGCs was tested in cultured cells treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus β-amyloid 1-42 (Aβ). SAMP8 treated with PEA displayed: 1) an improvement of in vitro colonic motor activity, citrate synthase activity and intestinal epithelial barrier integrity and 2) a decrease in colonic Aβ and α-synuclein (α-syn) accumulation, S100-β expression as well as enteric IL-1β and circulating LPS levels, as compared with untreated SAMP8 mice. In EGCs, treatment with PEA counteracted the increment of S100-β, TLR-4, NF-κB p65 and IL-1β release induced by LPS and Aβ. These results suggest that PEA, under a condition of cognitive decline, prevents the enteric glial hyperactivation, reduces AD protein accumulation and counteracts the onset and progression of colonic inflammatory condition, as well as relieves intestinal motor dysfunctions and improves the intestinal epithelial barrier integrity. Therefore, PEA represents a viable approach for the management of the enteric inflammation and motor contractile abnormalities associated with AD."

With the unavoidable expanding life expectancy, an increasing number of small animals will be affected. Although there is no cure, early detection and intervention are vitally important to delay cognitive decline. Knowledge of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying disease onset and progression is an equally decisive factor for developing effective approaches. Uncontrolled neuroinflammation, orchestrated in the central nervous system mainly by astrocytes, microglia, and resident mast cells, is currently acknowledged as a hallmark of neurodegeneration. This has prompted scientists to find a way to rebalance the altered crosstalk between these cells. In this context, great emphasis has been given to the role played by the expanded endocannabinoid system, i.e., endocannabinoidome, because of its prominent role in physiological and pathological neuroinflammation. Within the endocannabinoidome, great attention has been paid to palmitoylethanolamide due to its safe and pro-homeostatic effects. The availability of new ultramicronized formulations highly improved the oral bioavailability of palmitoylethanolamide, paving the way to its dietary use. Ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide has been repeatedly tested in animal models of age-related neurodegeneration with promising results. Data accumulated so far suggest that supplementation with ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide helps to accomplish successful brain aging."

Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is a naturally occurring fatty acid amide with analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. We aimed to examine its effect on OA and elucidate the molecular mechanism of actions in monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-induced OA Sprague-Dawley rats. The experimental animals were divided into normal control group (injected with saline + treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), NOR), control group (injected with MIA + treated with PBS, CON), 50 or 100 mg/kg body weight (BW)/day PEA-treated group (injected with MIA + treated with 50 or 100 mg of PEA/kg BW/day, PEA50 or PEA100), and positive control group (injected with MIA + treated with 6 mg of diclofenac/kg BW/day, DiC). The changes in blood parameters, body parameters, gene expression of inflammatory mediators and cytokines, knee thickness, and joint tissue were observed. Oral administration of PEA had no adverse effects on the BW, liver, or kidneys. PEA reduced knee joint swelling and cartilage degradation in MIA-induced OA rats. The serum levels of leukotriene B4, nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and prostaglandin E2 considerably reduced in the PEA100 group compared with those in the CON group. In the synovia of knee joints, the mRNA expression of iNOS, 5-Lox, Cox-2, Il-1β, Tnf-α, and Mmp-2, -3, -9, and -13 apparently increased with MIA administration. Meanwhile, Timp-1 mRNA expression apparently decreased in the CON group but increased to the normal level with PEA treatment. Thus, PEA can be an effective therapeutic agent for OA.",

An in vitro model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human epithelial lung cells that mimics the pathogen-associated molecular pattern and reproduces the cell signaling pathways in cytokine storm syndrome has been used. In this model of acute lung injury, the combination effects of ALAPEA, administered before and after LPS injury, were investigated. Our data demonstrated that a combination of 50 µM ALA + 5 µM PEA can reduce ROS and nitric oxide (NO) levels modulating the major cytokines involved on COVID-19 infection when administered either before or after LPS-induced damage. The best outcome was observed when administered after LPS, thus reinforcing the hypothesis that ALA combined with PEA to modulate the key point of cytokine storm syndrome. This work supports for the first time that the combination of ALA with PEA may represent a novel intervention strategy to counteract inflammatory damage related to COVID-19 by restoring the cascade activation of the immune response and acting as a powerful antioxidant.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: There are few effective pharmacological treatments for Tourette's syndrome. Many patients with Tourette's syndrome experience impairing tic symptoms despite use of available evidence-based treatments. The investigators conducted a small, uncontrolled trial to examine the safety, tolerability, and dosing of THX-110, a combination of Δ9-tetrahydracannabinol (Δ9-THC) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), in Tourette's syndrome. METHODS: A 12-week uncontrolled trial of THX-110 (maximum daily Δ9-THC dose, 10 mg, and a constant 800-mg dose of PEA) in 16 adults with Tourette's syndrome was conducted. The primary outcome was improvement on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) total tic score. Secondary outcomes included measures of comorbid conditions and the number of participants who elected to continue treatment in the 24-week extension phase. RESULTS: Tic symptoms significantly improved over time with THX-110 treatment. Improvement in tic symptoms was statistically significant within 1 week of starting treatment compared with baseline. THX-110 treatment led to an average improvement in tic symptoms of more than 20%, or a 7-point decrease in the YGTSS score. Twelve of the 16 participants elected to continue to the extension phase, and only two participants dropped out early. Side effects were common but were generally managed by decreasing Δ9-THC dosing, slowing the dosing titration, and shifting dosing to nighttime. CONCLUSIONS: Although the initial data from this trial in adults with refractory Tourette's syndrome are promising, future randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials are necessary to demonstrate efficacy of THX-110 treatment. The challenges raised by the difficulty in blinding trials due to the psychoactive properties of many cannabis-derived compounds need to be further appreciated in these trial designs.",

It may present as debilitating pain with a sensation of burning and electric-like symptoms and is often difficult to manage effectively. Although pharmacological medications are the first line of treatment, multidisciplinary teams are sometimes required to provide appropriate treatment to improve quality of life and overall wellbeing. AIM: The aim of this study is to present a case of post herpetic neuralgia relieved successfully by the compound palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) - a natural alternative to pharmacological pain relief. METHODS: We present the case of a 67 year-old male with ongoing post-herpetic neuralgia, over a 3-year period, as a result of complications from shingles (herpes zoster). Previous studies on the relationship between PEA and neuropathy were reviewed, with an attempt to discuss the possible underlying mechanism of PEA on neuropathic pain. RESULTS: PEA demonstrated effective pain relief within 48 hours at an administered daily dose of 900 mg (10 mg/kg). CONCLUSIONS: PEA may offer a valid nutraceutical treatment for practitioners.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Approximately 30% of patients with confirmed COVID-19 report persistent smell or taste disorders as long-term sequalae of infection. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is associated with inflammatory changes to the olfactory bulb, and treatments with anti-inflammatory properties are hypothesized to attenuate viral injury and promote recovery of olfaction after infection. Our study investigated the efficacy of a supplement with Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and Luteolin to support recovery of olfaction in COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a randomized-controlled pilot study in outpatients with history of confirmed COVID-19 with post-infection olfactory impairment that persisted ≥ 90 days after SARS-CoV-2 negative testing. Patients were randomized to two times a day olfactory rehabilitation alone or weekly olfactory rehabilitation plus daily oral supplement with PEA and Luteolin. Subjects with preexisting olfactory disorders were excluded. Sniffin' Sticks assessments were performed at baseline and 30 days after treatment.  Data on gender, age, and time since infection were collected. Kruskal-Wallis (KW) test was used to compare variances of Sniff scores between groups over time, and Spearman's correlation coefficients were calculated to assess for correlations between Sniff Score and gender or duration of infection. RESULTS: Among 12 patients enrolled (n=7, supplement; n=5, controls), patients receiving supplement had greater improvement in olfactory threshold, discrimination, and identification score versus controls (p=0.01). Time since infection was negatively correlated with Sniff Score, and there was no correlation between gender. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment combining olfactory rehabilitation with oral supplementation with PEA and Luteolin was associated with improved recovery of olfactory function, most marked in those patients with longstanding olfactory dysfunction. Further studies are necessary to replicate these findings and to determine whether early intervention including olfactory rehabilitation and PEA+Luteolin oral supplement might prevent SARS-CoV-2 associated olfactory impairment.",

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is usually used intratracheally to induce ALI in mice. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of an ultramicronized preparation of palmitoylethanolamide (um-PEA) in mice subjected to LPS-induced ALI. Histopathological analysis reveals that um-PEA reduced alteration in lung after LPS intratracheal administration. Besides, um-PEA decreased wet/dry weight ratio and myeloperoxidase, a marker of neutrophils infiltration, macrophages and total immune cells number and mast cells degranulation in lung. Moreover, um-PEA could also decrease cytokines release of interleukin (IL)-6, interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-18. Furthermore, um-PEA significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, alpha (IκBα) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) activation in ALI, and at the same time decreased extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38/MAPK) expression, that was increased after LPS administration. Our study suggested that um-PEA contrasted LPS-induced ALI, exerting its potential role as an adjuvant anti-inflammatory therapeutic for treating lung injury, maybe also by p38/NF-κB pathway.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The neurologic complications of rheumatic diseases (RDs) are highly variable, and their manifestations are linked to the pathogenesis and clinical phenotype of the specific RDs. In rheumatoid arthritis, for example, the peripheral nervous system is most commonly involved and mononeuritis multiplex, nerve entrapment and vasculitic sensorimotor neuropathies are not uncommon. Often the therapy for these disorders is not easy and is characterized by the use of different drugs. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) has been tested in a wide variety of animal models and has been evaluated in several clinical studies for nerve compression syndromes, demonstrating that PEA acts as an effective and safe analgesic compound. Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALC) has also been shown to be an effective and safe treatment in painful peripheral neuropathy. In the last years the synergistic effect between PEA and ALC has been demonstrated. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of supplementation of standard therapy (STh) with Kalanit® (Chiesi Italia Spa; Parma, Italy) in patients with peripheral neuropathy secondary to RDs. METHODS: Patients at the time of enrollment were affected by RDs with neuropathy from <12 months, documented by electromyography. The analyzed patients were treated with the STh chosen according to their rheumatic disease (RA or SpA) and for their neuropathy (e.g. analgesic, NSAIDs, pregabalin or gabapentin) as per clinical practice. The sample was divided into 2 groups: group 1, patients treated with STh, to which a fixed combination of PEA (600 mg) + ALC (500 mg) (Kalanit®) was added twice a day for 2 weeks and then once a day for 6 months; group 2, patients treated only with STh. Each patient underwent clinical evaluations and questionnaires were administered in order to evaluate their neuropathy and the efficacy of the therapy. RESULTS: In group 1, 18 patients suffering from sciatic pain, 16 patients from carpal tunnel syndrome and 8 patients with peripheral neuropathy of the lower limbs were included and PEA + ALC FC was added to STh. These patients were compared with patients from group 2, who had the same pathology and demographic characteristics: 20 patients with sciatic pain, 15 with carpal tunnel syndrome and 5 with peripheral neuropathy of the lower limbs, respectively; this group was treated with STh only. Patients treated with PEA + ALC FC had a significant improvement in pain VAS compared to patients treated with group 2 in all the diseases analyzed (P value: sciatic pain 0.032, carpal tunnel syndrome 0.025 and lower limbs neuropathy 0.041). Patients in group 1 showed a significant improvement compared to patients treated in group 2 also from a specific score. Specifically, LBP-IQ showed significant improvement in group one (P value: 0.031), as did CHFD (P=0.011) and NPQ (P=0.025). CONCLUSIONS: The synergistic effect of PEA and ALC seems to have a further advantage in the treatment of this type of pathology, including the anti-inflammatory effect but also in terms of therapy optimization and therefore of better adherence to treatments. Our study shows that it is important to identify the type of pain to follow an accurate diagnostic algorithm, considering the clinical characteristics of the patient and carefully evaluate the indication, preferring a multimodal approach.",

      "abstract": "Genetically engineered probiotics, able to in situ deliver therapeutically active compounds while restoring gut eubiosis, could represent an attractive therapeutic alternative in Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Palmitoylethanolamide is an endogenous lipid able to exert immunomodulatory activities and restore epithelial barrier integrity in human models of colitis, by binding the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα). The aim of this study was to explore the efficacy of a newly designed PEA-producing probiotic (pNAPE-LP) in a mice model of C. difficile toxin A (TcdA)-induced colitis. The human N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD), a key enzyme involved in the synthesis of PEA, was cloned and expressed in a Lactobacillus paracasei that was intragastrically administered to mice 7 days prior the induction of the colitis. Bacteria carrying the empty vector served as negative controls (pLP).In the presence of palmitate, pNAPE-LP was able to significantly increase PEA production by 27,900%, in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion. Mice treated with pNAPE-LP showed a significant improvement of colitis in terms of histological damage score, macrophage count, and myeloperoxidase levels (-53, -82, and -70.4%, respectively). This was paralleled by a significant decrease both in the expression of toll-like receptor-4 (-71%), phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (-72%), hypoxia-inducible factor-1-alpha (-53%), p50 (-74%), and p65 (-60%) and in the plasmatic levels of interleukin-6 (-86%), nitric oxide (-59%), and vascular endothelial growth factor (-71%). Finally, tight junction protein expression was significantly improved by pNAPE-LP treatment as witnessed by the rescue of zonula occludens-1 (+304%), Ras homolog family member A-GTP (+649%), and occludin expression (+160%). These protective effects were mediated by the specific release of PEA by the engineered probiotic as they were abolished in PPARα knockout mice and in wild-type mice treated with pLP. Herein, we demonstrated that pNAPE-LP has therapeutic potential in CDI by inhibiting colonic inflammation and restoring tight junction protein expression in mice, paving the way to next generation probiotics as a promising strategy in CDI prevention."

      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) pathophysiology is not completely understood; however, altered inflammatory response and glutamate signaling have been reported, leading to the investigation of molecules targeting the immune-glutamatergic system in ASD treatment. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is a naturally occurring saturated N-acylethanolamine that has proven to be effective in controlling inflammation, depression, epilepsy, and pain, possibly through a neuroprotective role against glutamate toxicity. Here, we systematically reviewed all human and animal studies examining PEA and its biobehavioral correlates in ASD. Studies indicate altered serum/brain levels of PEA and other endocannabinoids (ECBs)/acylethanolamines (AEs) in ASD. Altered PEA signaling response to social exposure and altered expression/activity of enzymes responsible for the synthesis and catalysis of ECBs/AEs, as well as downregulation of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α (PPAR-α) and cannabinoid receptor target GPR55 mRNA brain expression, have been reported. Stress and exposure to exogenous cannabinoids may modulate ECBs/AEs levels and expression of candidate genes for neuropsychiatric disorders, with implications for ASD. Limited research suggests that PEA supplementation reduces overall autism severity by improving language and social and nonsocial behaviors. Potential neurobiological underpinnings include modulation of immune response, neuroinflammation, neurotrophy, apoptosis, neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, neurodegeneration, mitochondrial function, and microbiota activity, possibly through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α) activation.",

Its clinical picture is characterized by pulmonary involvement that culminates, in the most severe cases, in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, COVID-19 affects other organs and systems, including cardiovascular, urinary, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems. Currently, unique-drug therapy is not supported by international guidelines. In this context, it is important to resort to adjuvant therapies in combination with traditional pharmacological treatments. Among natural bioactive compounds, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) seems to have potentially beneficial effects. In fact, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized an ongoing clinical trial with ultramicronized (um)-PEA as an add-on therapy in the treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In support of this hypothesis, in vitro and in vivo studies have highlighted the immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective and pain-relieving effects of PEA, especially in its um form. The purpose of this review is to highlight the potential use of um-PEA as an adjuvant treatment in SARS-CoV-2 infection."

      "abstract": "The management of chronic pain is an integral challenge of small animal veterinary practitioners. Multiple pharmacological agents are usually employed to treat maladaptive pain including opiates, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and others. In order to limit adverse effects and tolerance development, they are often combined with non-pharmacologic measures such as acupuncture and dietary interventions. Accumulating evidence suggests that non-neuronal cells such as mast cells and microglia play active roles in the pathogenesis of maladaptive pain. Accordingly, these cells are currently viewed as potential new targets for managing chronic pain. Palmitoylethanolamide is an endocannabinoid-like compound found in several food sources and considered a body's own analgesic. The receptor-dependent control of non-neuronal cells mediates the pain-relieving effect of palmitoylethanolamide. Accumulating evidence shows the anti-hyperalgesic effect of supplemented palmitoylethanolamide, especially in the micronized and co-micronized formulations (i.e., micro-palmitoylethanolamide), which allow for higher bioavailability. In the present paper, the role of non-neuronal cells in pain signaling is discussed and a large number of studies on the effect of palmitoylethanolamide in inflammatory and neuropathic chronic pain are reviewed. Overall, available evidence suggests that there is place for micro-palmitoylethanolamide in the dietary management of chronic pain in dogs and cats."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vascular remodeling processes induced by acute and chronic injuries are characterized by inflammation and oxidative stress. In arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, and restenosis, the progression of neointimal hyperplasia is a key event of vascular damage. OBJECTIVE: Our study was aimed to investigate the inflammation and oxidative stress development during vascular impairment and the potential efficacy of treatment of new micro composite N-palmitoylethanolamine/Rutin at a ratio of 1:1 (PEA/RUT). The anti-inflammatory effects of Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) are well known. Rutin has important pharmacological actions, including antioxidant and vasoprotective. METHODS: As a model of vascular injury, we used the complete ligature of the left carotid artery for fourteen days and administered PEA/RUT at the dose of 10 mg/Kg. RESULTS: This study demonstrated that after fourteen days of carotid ligation, there is a substantial structural change in the vessel morphology, with inflammatory cell infiltration and reactive oxygen species production. PEA/RUT administration reduced change in vascular morphology, cytokines like monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and adhesion molecules expression like intercellular adhesion molecules-1 (ICAM-1), proinflammatory cytokines production (IL-1 β, IL-6 and TNF- α), oxidative and nitrosative stress (nitrotyrosine and PARP expression and NRF2 pathway). CONCLUSION: Our data clearly demonstrate the beneficial effect of PEA/RUT administration in reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular damage.",

In this study, we designed, realized, and tested a drug-carrier conjugate between PEA (the active drug) and glucuronic acid (the carrier). The conjugate, named GLUPEA, was characterized for its capability of increasing PEA levels and exerting anti-inflammatory activity both in vitro and in vivo. GLUPEA treatment, compared to the same concentration of PEA, resulted in higher cellular amounts of PEA and the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), and increased 2-AG-induced transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) channel desensitization to capsaicin. GLUPEA inhibited pro-inflammatory monocyte chemoattractant protein 2 (MCP-2) release from stimulated keratinocytes, and it was almost as efficacious as ultra-micronized PEA at reducing colitis in dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS)-injected mice when using the same dose. GLUPEA is a novel pro-drug able to efficiently mimic the anti-inflammatory and endocannabinoid enhancing actions of PEA.",

The ultra-micronized formulation of PEA (um-PEA), that has an enhanced rate of dissolution, is extensively used. Acetyl-l-carnitine (LAC), employed for the treatment of neuropathic pain in humans, is able to cause analgesia by up-regulating type-2 metabotropic glutamate (mGlu2) receptors. In the present study, we tested different associations of um-PEA, LAC and non-micronized PEA (non-m-PEA) in a rat model of carrageenan (CAR)-induced paw edema. Intraplantar injection of CAR into the hind paw of animals caused edema, thermal hyperalgesia, accumulation of infiltrating inflammatory cells and augmented myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. All these parameters were decreased in a significantly manner by oral administration of a compound constituted by a mixture of um-PEA and LAC in relation 1:1 (5 mg/kg), but not with the association of single compounds administered one after the other. These findings showed the superior anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive action displayed by oral administration of um-PEA and LAC versus LAC plus, separate but consecutive, um-PEA in the rat paw CAR model of inflammatory pain.",

Although efficacious, the adverse effect profile of topical corticosteroids limits long-term use. As an alternative, cannabinoids have been shown to have anti-inflammatory therapeutic effects. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the effects of a topical cannabinoid product using dermatitis mouse model. METHODS: Thirty-five mice were randomized into treatment groups. 12- O -tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate was used as an irritant on 1 ear with the contralateral ear serving as a control. Ear edema was calipered. The test product containing 0.9% cannabidiol and palmitoylethanolamide was compared with a potent topical corticosteroid. RESULTS: Treatment with topical cannabinoid formulation reduced ear edema by 51.27% at 24 hours' and 65.69% at 48 hours' postapplication. Alternatively, mometasone reduced ear edema by 89.82% at 24 hours and 98.25% at 48 hours. Natural reduction (control) in ear edema was 26.32% at 24 hours and 44.21% at 48 hours. Both test groups resulted in significantly decreased edema when compared with baseline ( P < 0.05), as well as compared with the negative control group ( P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Significant reduction in ear edema, a marker for localized cutaneous inflammation, could be attributed to anti-inflammatory properties of cannabinoids. Although effects were less robust than topical corticosteroid use, cannabinoid formulations have therapeutic promise for dermatitis.",

      "abstract": "Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an endogenous ethanolamine playing a protective and homeodynamic role in animals and plants. Prenatal developmental toxicity of PEA was tested following oral administration to pregnant female Wistar rats, from days 0 to 19 of gestation, at dosage of 250, 500, or 1,000 mg/kg body weight, according to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Test Guideline No. 414. On gestation day 20, cesarean sections were performed on the dams, followed by examination of their ovaries and uterine contents. The fetuses were further examined for external, visceral, and skeletal abnormalities. Palmitoylethanolamide did not cause any alterations at any of the given dosages in the measured maternal parameters of systemic toxicity (body weight, food consumption, survival, thyroid functions, organ weight, histopathology), reproductive toxicity (preimplantation and postimplantation losses, uterus weight, number of live/dead implants and early/late resorptions, litter size and weights, number of fetuses, their sex ratio), and fetal external, visceral, or skeletal observations. Any alterations that were recorded were \"normal variations\" or \"minor anomalies,\" which were unrelated to treatment with PEA. Under the condition of this prenatal study, the no-observed-adverse-effect level of PEA for maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats was found to be >1,000 mg/kg body weight/d. It indicates that PEA is well tolerated by and is safe to pregnant rats even at a high dose of 1,000 mg/kg body weight/d, equivalent to a human dose of greater than 9.7 g/d. This prenatal developmental toxicity study contributes greatly in building a robust safety profile for PEA.",

Preventing inflammation and fibrosis in the extraocular muscle are crucial for treatment of postoperative adhesions. In the present study, we found that administration of palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) attenuated postoperative inflammation and fibroproliferation through activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), thus prevented scar formation. Inhibition of PEA degradation by N-Acylethanolamine acid amidase (NAAA) inhibitor F96 led to the same pharmacological results. PPARα activation suppressed both canonical and non-canonical TGFβ signaling. Mechanistically, we found that PPARα directly bound to TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), thus preventing its hyperphosphorylation and the activation of downstream p38 and JNK1/2 signaling. Taken together, current study suggested that PEA could be a novel therapeutic approach for postoperative adhesions after strabismus surgery.",

Many compounds have been proposed as phytotherapics in the prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19. The extensive interest of the general public and the enormous social media coverage on this topic urges the scientific community to address the question of whether which nutraceuticals can actually be employed in preventing and treating this newly described coronavirus-related disease. Recently, the Canadian biotech pharma company \"FSD Pharma\" received the green light from the Food and Drug Administration to design a proof-of-concept study evaluating the effects of ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) in COVID-19 patients. The story of PEA as a nutraceutical to prevent and treat infectious diseases dates back to the 1970s where the molecule was branded under the name Impulsin and was used for its immunomodulatory properties in influenza virus infection. The present paper aims at analyzing the potential of PEA as a nutraceutical and the previous evidence suggesting its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties in infectious and respiratory diseases and how these could translate to COVID-19 care."

PEA has anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties and is very well tolerated in humans. In the present article, the basal pharmacology of PEA is reviewed. In terms of its pharmacokinetic properties, most work has been undertaken upon designing formulations for its absorption and upon characterising the enzymes involved in its metabolism, but little is known about its bioavailability, tissue distribution, and excretion pathways. PEA exerts most of its biological effects in the body secondary to the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α), but PPAR-α-independent pathways involving other receptors (Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), GPR55) have also been identified. Given the potential clinical utility of PEA, not least for the treatment of pain where there is a clear need for new well-tolerated drugs, we conclude that the gaps in our knowledge, in particular those relating to the pharmacokinetic properties of the compound, need to be filled.",
