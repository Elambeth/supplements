      "abstract": "Bladder cancer has a high incidence worldwide and is characterized by a high recurrence rate, metastatic potential, and a significant socioeconomic burden. Conventional treatment modalities usually exhibit serious adverse complications, which also negatively affect patients' quality of life. In the context of exploring new treatment approaches with fewer side effects, the utilization of natural compounds as alternative and/or complementary therapeutic options seems appealing. In the present study, the potential use and effects of various bioactive phytochemicals, including curcumin, resveratrol, epigallocatechin, genistein, and several others, in bladder cancer treatment are thoroughly reviewed. A special focus is given to their potential to beneficially modulate important molecular signaling pathways and mechanisms affecting cell survival, proliferation, migration, and apoptosis, which play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of bladder cancer, such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK, Wnt/β-Catenin, Notch, Hedgehog, Hippo, JAK2/STAT3, and PAF/PAF-receptor pathways. Nevertheless, most studies have been conducted in cell cultures and animal models. Due to differences in genetics and metabolism, more clinical trials are needed to ensure the bio-efficacy of these phytochemicals in humans."

      "abstract": "There are suggested treatment options for schizophrenia (SZ), including antipsychotic medications. Unfortunately, these drugs mostly ameliorate only the positive symptoms of SZ, and patients have less tendency for compliance due to the drug's side effects. Hence, there is a need for additional or adjunct therapeutic options. This review considers selected phytochemicals with anti-schizophrenic activity as an alternative therapy. We searched the scientific literature and reviewed the evidence from pre-clinical (animal) and clinical studies using some phytochemicals in SZ. The reviewed phytochemicals provided varying potential beneficial effects on SZ. Of particular interest, berberine may provide additional ameliorative advantages against the disorder. Although still nascent in scientific research, these studies suggest a potential adjunct therapeutic option against the pathophysiological pathways implicated in SZ. We recommend robust, carefully performed randomized controlled trials evaluating the role of these phytochemicals in SZ."

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a formidable challenge, necessitating the discovery of effective therapeutic agents targeting β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). This study investigates the inhibitory potential of phytochemicals derived from Bacopa monnieri, a plant renowned for its cognitive-enhancing properties, in comparison to established synthetic inhibitors such as Atabecestat, Lanabecestat, and Verubecestat. Utilizing molecular docking and advanced computational simulations, we demonstrate that Bacopaside I exhibits superior binding affinity and a unique interaction profile with BACE1, suggesting a more nuanced inhibitory mechanism. Our findings highlight the promising role of Bacopa monnieri phytochemicals as viable alternatives to synthetic drugs, emphasizing their potential to overcome limitations faced in clinical settings. Furthermore, the development of the SIMANA ( https://simana.streamlit.app/ ) platform enhances the visualization and analysis of protein-ligand interactions, facilitating a deeper understanding of the dynamics involved. This research not only underscores the therapeutic promise of natural compounds in AD treatment but also advocates for a paradigm shift towards integrating traditional medicinal knowledge into contemporary drug discovery efforts.",

      "abstract": "Serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine (NE) are key monoamine neurotransmitters regulating behaviors, mood, and cognition. 5-HT affects early brain development, and its dysfunction induces brain vulnerability to stress, raising the risk of depression, anxiety, and autism in adulthood. These neurotransmitters are synthesized from tryptophan and tyrosine via hydroxylation and decarboxylation, and are metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO). This review aims to summarize the current findings on the role of dietary phytochemicals in modulating monoamine neurotransmitter biosynthesis, metabolism, and function, with an emphasis on their potential therapeutic applications in neuropsychiatric disorders. Phytochemicals exert antioxidant, neurotrophic, and neurohormonal activities, regulate gene expression, and induce epigenetic modifications. Phytoestrogens activate the estrogen receptors or estrogen-responsive elements of the promoter of target genes, enhance transcription of tryptophan hydroxylase and tyrosine hydroxylase, while inhibiting that of MAO. These compounds also influence the interaction between genetic and environmental factors, potentially reversing dysregulated neurotransmission and the brain architecture associated with neuropsychiatric conditions. Despite promising preclinical findings, clinical applications of phytochemicals remain challenging. Advances in nanotechnology and targeted delivery systems offer potential solutions to enhance clinical efficacy. This review discusses mechanisms, challenges, and strategies, underscoring the need for further research to advance phytochemical-based interventions for neuropsychiatric diseases.",

      "abstract": "Inflammation is associated with the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes and COVID-19. Phytochemicals have the potential to modulate inflammation, expression of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry receptors (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2)) and glucose transport in the gut. This study assessed the impact of phytochemicals on these processes. We screened 12 phytochemicals alongside 10 pharmaceuticals and three plant extracts, selected for known or hypothesised effects on the SARS-CoV-2 receptors and COVID-19 risk, for their effects on the expression of ACE2 or TMPRSS2 in differentiated Caco-2/TC7 human intestinal epithelial cells. Genistein, apigenin, artemisinin and sulforaphane were the most promising ones, as assessed by the downregulation of TMPRSS2, and thus they were used in subsequent experiments. The cells were then co-stimulated with pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) for ≤168 h to induce inflammation, which are known to induce multiple pathways, including the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathway. Target gene expression (ACE2, TMPRSS2, SGLT1 (sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1) and GLUT2 (glucose transporter 2)) was measured by droplet digital PCR, while interleukin-1 (IL-6), interleukin-1 (IL-8) and ACE2 proteins were assessed using ELISA in both normal and inflamed cells. IL-1β and TNF-α treatment upregulated ACE2, TMPRSS2 and SGLT1 gene expression. ACE2 increased with the duration of cytokine exposure, coupled with a significant decrease in IL-8, SGLT1 and TMPRSS2 over time. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the increase in ACE2 was strongly associated with a decrease in IL-8 (r = -0.77, p < 0.01). The regulation of SGLT1 gene expression followed the same pattern as TMPRSS2, implying a common mechanism. Although none of the phytochemicals decreased inflammation-induced IL-8 secretion, genistein normalised inflammation-induced increases in SGLT1 and TMPRSS2. The association between TMPRSS2 and SGLT1 gene expression, which is particularly evident in inflammatory conditions, suggests a common regulatory pathway. Genistein downregulated the inflammation-induced increase in SGLT1 and TMPRSS2, which may help lower the postprandial glycaemic response and COVID-19 risk or severity in healthy individuals and those with metabolic disorders."

      "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory illness in which inflammatory mediators and cathepsin B and other proteases play a role in disease progression. The existing treatments may have negative side effects. Therefore, an alternative natural therapy for RA has been considered safe and beneficial. Secondary metabolites from plants have been suggested as one such alternative. In our present study phytochemicals from Musa acuminata (banana) peel have been explored for their anti-cathepsin B and anti-inflammatory potential. The crude phytochemical extract inhibited cathepsin B with an IC50 value of 1.151 mg/ml. One hundred phytochemicals were identified by GC-MS in the extract. Cathepsin B inhibitory potential of each identified phytochemical was assessed using in-silico studies and revealed stigmasterol, campesterol, methyl linolenate, and methyl linoleate possessed more favourable binding energy than positive control (E-64-cathepsin B complex) and inhibited cathepsin B in-vitro. The combinatorial action of compounds resulted in synergistic cathepsin B inhibition where a combination of campesterol, stigmasterol, and methyl linolenate showed maximum inhibition of 97.80 %. Methyl linolenate showed the least inhibition constant among other compounds. Cell line studies with methyl linolenate showed no toxicity to SW982 cells and also downregulated p65 expression at 5 μM in TNF-α induced SW982 human synovial fibroblast cells indicating its anti-inflammation role. Thus, the study has shown that banana peel may serve as a resource for exploring phytochemicals for their anti-inflammatory role in RA as a nutraceutical. Being an edible plant, it may be suggested as a dietary supplement to combat RA and cathepsin B associated pathologies."

      "abstract": "Cancer therapy faces challenges due to drug resistance and signaling pathway redundancy, allowing cancer cells to evade treatment. Dual inhibition of Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-2 (SHP2) and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) offers a promising strategy to overcome these limitations. We evaluated neem-derived compounds against SHP2 (PDB ID: 5EHR) and HSP90 (PDB ID: 1YET) using molecular docking, hierarchical clustering, and structural similarity analyses. Drug-likeness was assessed using Lipinski's rule of five, and Tanimoto similarity coefficients were calculated. Nimbocinol, nimbidin, and margolone showed promising binding affinities to both targets. Nimbocinol demonstrated superior binding to SHP2 (-10.463kcal/mol) compared to SHP099 (-10.009kcal/mol). Margolone formed specific interactions, including a salt bridge between its carboxylate group and His100 in HSP90. All compounds complied with Lipinski's rule, with margolone showing structural similarities to geldanamycin and SHP099. This study identifies neem-derived compounds as potential dual inhibitors of SHP2 and HSP90, presenting a paradigm shift in cancer therapeutic strategy. These findings provide a foundation for developing novel multi-targeted anticancer therapeutics."

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing neurological disorder giving impact cognition and memory, posing a global health challenge with over 55 million individuals affected. It is the 7th foremost cause of dying worldwide, and its pervasiveness is expected to twofold in each five years, reaching 115 million by 2050. AD is characterized by neurofibrillary tangles, senile plaques, and oxidative stress, leading to synaptic failure and cognitive decline. Currently, there is no cure, and available FDA-approved drugs provide only symptomatic relief. The disease progresses through five phases- mild cognitive impairment (MCI), very severe, severe, moderate and mild AD. Research on AD focuses on various neurodegenerative pathways, including inflammation, oxidative stress, genetic factors, environmental variables, and amyloid-beta accumulation. Existing FDA-accepted drugs, like rivastigmine, memantine, galantamine, and donepezil, primarily address early symptoms but have limitations, including side effects and high costs. In this context, phytochemicals from plants, such as resveratrol, huperzine, quercetin, galantamine, and rosmarinic acid, show promise as potential treatments for AD and overcome the challenges and limitation of conventional treatment. These natural substances are being investigated for their ability to lower the risk of AD safely. However, there is a lack of comprehensive knowledge about their application, necessitating further research and clinical trials to explore their potential benefits and limitations. This review serves as an essential reference for advancing future studies on Alzheimer's disease. By thoroughly analyzing neurodegenerative pathways, addressing drug limitations, and highlighting the potential of phytochemicals, we establish a strong foundation for developing innovative therapeutic strategies. Closing the knowledge gap related to the use of phytochemicals in Alzheimer's management is not just important; it is critical for creating novel and more effective treatments for this challenging neurological condition."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain, the most conserved region of STAT5a/b (aa 573- 712), is crucial for receptor-specific recruitment and STAT5 dimerization, making it a therapeutic target in prostate cancer (PCa). OBJECTIVES: This study explored the SH2 domain of STAT5a and carried out the identification of natural STAT5a inhibitors. METHODS: Using template-based homology modeling, we constructed the structure of human STAT5a (VP1P) and compared it with its 3D crystal of the STAT5a protein obtained from the RCSB database and the model generated by the AlphaFold database. In this study, we carried out molecular docking studies using AutoDock Vina on the top 500 natural compounds identified through a pharmacophore search of the ZINC database using ZINCPharmer. Furthermore, the top ten compounds with the highest binding energies were evaluated for their drug-likeness and ADMET properties using SWISS ADME and ProTox-II, followed by 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the Desmond module of the Schrodinger suite. RESULTS: Docking studies revealed Pedunculagin (-10.5 kcal/mol), Folic acid (-10.1 kcal/mol), Chebulinic acid (- 10.0 kcal/mol), Chebulagic acid (-9.8 kcal/mol), and Oleandrin (-9.8 kcal/mol) as the top candidates, compared to the STAT5 inhibitor (Phase-II Clinical Trial) (-8.5 kcal/mol). ADMET analysis confirmed their safety profiles. MD simulations showed stable protein-ligand complexes, with all compounds interacting with the conserved Arg638 residue at the active site, similar to the STAT5 inhibitor. CONCLUSION: Pedunculagin demonstrated the strongest binding energy and stability, making it a promising candidate for further development as a novel lead compound to disrupt STAT5a/b dimerization in PCa therapy."

      "abstract": "Kallikrein-related peptidase 2 (KLK2) is a serine protease exhibiting antiangiogenic properties through proteolytic activity. KLK2 is overexpressed in prostate cancer and plays a pivotal role in cancer progression, establishing it as a potential therapeutic target. Despite the promising results of small molecule inhibitors targeting KLK2 in prostate cancer treatment, there are still many challenges in the development and application of these inhibitors. As a consequence, very few KLK2 inhibitors have advanced to clinical trials because of issues with specificity and selectivity. Moreover, the precise mechanisms underlying KLK2's interactions with small molecule inhibitors remain inadequately understood. This study used structure-based virtual screening of a phytochemical library and found three compounds, Phaseolin, Withaphysalin D, and Nicandrenone, as potential KLK2 inhibitors. These compounds exhibited high binding affinities (-8.9 to -8.8 kcal/mol), favorable pharmacokinetic profiles, and stable interactions with KLK2's catalytic residues (including His65) in docking studies. Their binding was further validated through MM-PBSA free energy calculations, which confirmed energetically favorable interactions with KLK2. The findings suggest that these phytochemicals have a high potential to be exploited as novel KLK2 inhibitors with improved efficacy. While experimental validation of enzymatic inhibition and antitumor efficacy is required, this study provides a structural and mechanistic foundation for advancing these candidates into preclinical testing. These results also highlight the use of phytochemical libraries and dynamics-driven virtual screening in developing targeted therapies for prostate cancer."

      "abstract": "Breast cancer, being among the most frequent and fatal cancers in women, is an enormous issue globally. The critical requirement for novel treatment methods is underscored by its high mortality rate and relentless advancement. Even though breast cancer is one of the world's most common causes of death, the therapeutic avenue is still limited. The aim of this work is to investigate the potential inhibitory effects of specific compounds present in leaf extract from Mangifera indica on the growth of drug-resistant breast cancer protease PDB ID 3w32. The chemical compounds present in Mangifera indica leaves were used to analyze using molecular modeling techniques, such as molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, quantum mechanics (QM) calculations, and the Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) method, in order to examine three key chemical constituents: quercetin (08), catechin (09), and elagic acid (10). The ligands undergo extensive testing to figure out how effective they are against the 3w32-overexpressing breast cancer protein. Quantum calculations retaining HOMO-LUMO analysis might identify important characteristics of molecules, such as chemical potential, electronegativity, hardness, softness, and orbital energy gaps. According to the molecular docking inquiry, ligands 08, 09, and 10 are strong candidates with strong binding affinity for the breast cancer protein that overexpresses 3w32. The protein binding site stability of the chosen natural ligands was verified by MD simulation. These three ligands not only surpass the efficacy of the FDA-approved treatment, but also fulfill the requirements for a possible new inhibitor of breast cancer."

It also highlights clinical progress, extraction methods, and optimized delivery systems to overcome developmental barriers. METHODS: A structured review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar (2020-2023). Keywords included phytochemicals, anticancer mechanisms, bioavailability, delivery systems, and clinical efficacy. Selected studies covered anticancer mechanisms, extraction technologies, and clinical findings. CONCLUSIONS: This review consolidates current knowledge on phytochemicals as anticancer agents, filling critical gaps in research. It underscores their role in personalized oncology while addressing challenges in development. Further research into extraction, formulation, and delivery will enhance clinical applications, improving patient outcomes and positioning phytochemicals as integral components of modern cancer therapy."

Several natural extracts and biomolecules with antioxidant activity are widely used in the production of dietary supplements or topical products, for the prevention and treatment of skin affections. Within this context, we pre-treated human skin fibroblasts (HFF1), skin-isolated stem cells (SSCs) and keratinocytes (HaCaT) with two creams containing a specific solar protection factor (SPF) for 72 h and then exposed the cells to UV light. Gene expression analysis was performed for the key cell cycle regulators (p16, p19, p21, p53 and TERT). Cell senescence was assessed by colorimetric assays of beta-galactosidase and antioxidant potential, revealing the ability of treated cells to counteract free radical production as a result of oxidative stress. Finally, possible mutations in DNA induced by photo exposure were studied. The results obtained demonstrated that the tested products elicit positive effects on all skin cell populations, preserving them from photo exposure damages and premature senescence, being also able to increase the DNA repairing mechanisms and inducing a youngest phenotype.",

      "abstract": "Neurological disorders are defined by a deterioration or disruption of the nervous system's structure and function. These diseases, which include multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and schizophrenia, are caused by intricate pathological processes that include excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, genetic mutations, and compromised neurotrophic signaling. Although current pharmaceutical treatments relieve symptoms, their long-term efficacy is limited due to adverse side effects and weak neuroprotective properties. However, when combined with other neuroprotective drugs or adjunct therapy, they may offer additional benefits and improve treatment outcomes. Phytochemicals have emerged as attractive therapeutic agents due to their ability to regulate essential neurotrophic pathways, especially the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling cascade. BDNF is an important target for neurodegenerative disease (ND) treatment since it regulates neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, and neuroprotection. This review emphasizes the molecular pathways through which various phytochemicals-such as flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids, and phenolic compounds-stimulate BDNF expression and modulate its downstream signaling pathways, including GSK-3β, MAPK/ERK, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, CREB, and Wnt/β-catenin. This paper also highlights how phytochemical combinations may interact to enhance BDNF activity, offering new therapeutic options for ND treatment. Despite their potential for neuroprotection, phytochemicals face challenges related to pharmacokinetics, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and absorption, highlighting the need for further research into combination therapies and improved formulations. Clinical assessment and mechanistic understanding of BDNF-targeted phytotherapy should be the main goals of future studies. The therapeutic efficacy of natural compounds in regulating neurotrophic signaling is highlighted in this review, providing a viable approach to the prevention and treatment of NDs."

This study employed the virtual screening of a few phytochemicals, and the resultant best compound, Scopoletin, was further investigated by a FRET-based enzymatic assay, revealing an experimental IC50 of 15.75 µM. The impact of Scopoletin on Mpro was further investigated by biophysical and MD simulation studies. Fluorescence spectroscopy identified a strong binding constant of 3.17 × 104 M⁻1 for Scopoletin binding to Mpro, as demonstrated by its effective fluorescence quenching of Mpro. Additionally, CD spectroscopy showed a significant reduction in the helical content of Mpro upon interaction with Scopoletin. The findings of thermodynamic measurements using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) supported the spectroscopic data, indicating a tight binding of Scopoletin to Mpro with a KA of 2.36 × 103 M-1. Similarly, interaction studies have also revealed that Scopoletin forms hydrogen bonds with the amino acids nearest to the active site, and this has been further supported by molecular dynamics simulation studies. These findings indicate that Scopoletin may be developed as a potential antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2 by targeting Mpro.",

This study targets phosphotransacetylase (PTA), an essential enzyme in acetate metabolism, as a potential therapeutic target. A comprehensive multi-tiered virtual screening approach was employed to identify potent phytochemicals and marine natural products (MNPs) from five databases (AMMPDB, CMNPD, MNPD, Seaweed and SPECS). Five promising bioactive molecules (AMMPDB10473, CMNPD23347, CMNPD5918, MNPD6660, and SPECS-AK-693) were identified, showing high docking scores (-8.17 to -10.83 kcal/mol) and MM-GBSA binding energy scores (-47.51 to -59.14 kcal/mol). These molecules adhered to Lipinski's rule of five (Ro5) and demonstrated acceptable pharmacokinetic profiles. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further validated the interaction potential of these molecules through HOMO and LUMO analysis. Long-range molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) over 300 ns confirmed the structural stability and enhanced hydrogen-bonding potential of the natural products-PTA complexes. Principal component analysis (PCA) and free energy landscape (FEL) contour plots revealed a single dominant energy basin, indicating structural stability and limited conformational flexibility of the complexes. Additionally, MMPBSA analysis corroborated the strong binding affinities of the identified hit molecules with PTA. Critical 'hot spot' residues (Phe516, Cys530, Ala531, and Tyr639) were identified, contributing significantly to the structural stability and binding energy of the complexes. This computational study offers valuable insights into the potential of these lead molecules for combating TB, providing a foundation for experimental validation and innovative therapeutic development, and paving the way for future research and breakthroughs in TB treatment."

      "abstract": "Lung cancer remains one of the most widespread and deadliest malignant tumors globally, with a particularly high mortality rate among all cancers. Recently, immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has emerged as a crucial treatment strategy for lung cancer patients, following surgical intervention, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted drug therapies. However, the therapeutic limitations are caused owing to their low response rate and undesirable side effects such as immune-related pneumonitis. Therefore, developing new strategies to improve the efficacy of ICIs while minimizing immune-related adverse events will be crucial for cancer immunotherapy. The tumor immune microenvironment plays a significant role in the success of lung cancer immunotherapy, and the immunosuppressive characteristics of the immune microenvironment are one of the major obstacles to the poor immunotherapeutic effect. Phytochemicals, naturally occurring compounds in plants, have shown promise in enhancing cancer immunotherapy by remodeling the immunosuppressive microenvironment, offering the potential to increase the efficacy of ICIs. Therefore, this review summarizes the associated mechanisms of phytochemicals remodeling the immunosuppressive microenvironment in lung cancer. Additionally, the review will focus on the synergistic effects of combining phytochemicals with ICIs, aiming to improve anticancer efficacy and reduce side effects, which may hopefully offer novel strategies to overcome current limitations in immunotherapy."

      "abstract": "This study was conducted to investigate the effects of a phytochemical mixture containing full spectrum cinnamon, clove, and oregano essential oils (CCO) on the growth performance, intestinal immunity, and intestinal integrity of broilers infected with coccidiosis. In chicken macrophage cells (CMCs), inflammation was induced with 1.0 µg/mL LPS, followed by stimulating with CCO at three concentrations (1.0, 10.0, and 100 µg/mL) and measuring the gene expression levels of IL-1β and IL-8. In chicken intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), CCO was added and cultured, and the gene expression levels of occludin, ZO-1, and MUC2 were measured. In the in vivo experiment, one hundred and twenty male broiler chickens (0-day-old) were allocated into three treatment groups: (1) basal diet without infection (NC), (2) basal diet with E. maxima infection (PC), and (3) CCO at 4.5 mg/kg feed with E. maxima infection (CCO). Body weight (BW) was measured on days 0, 7, 14, 20, and 22. PC and CCO groups were orally infected with E. maxima on day 14. Jejunal samples were collected on day 22 to conduct gene expression analysis of cytokines, TJ proteins, and antioxidant enzymes. CCO significantly decreased IL-1β and IL-8 in CMCs and increased ZO-1 and MUC2 in IECs in a dose-dependent manner. In the E. maxima-infected groups, dietary CCO tended to mitigate BW loss due to infection. Upon infection, proinflammatory cytokines were suppressed in the CCO group compared to the PC group. Dietary CCO also increased the expression of occludin and JAM-2 in the jejunum. However, CCO did not reduce the oocyst number in coccidiosis-infected chickens. These results suggest that dietary CCO supplementation may improve intestinal immunity and permeability, helping to reduce productivity losses in E. maxima-infected broilers through gut physiological responses, rather than direct antimicrobial effects. These results show the advantage of using in vitro screening based on host-mediated responses, and not on direct pathogen killing, when exploring new phytochemicals to mitigate disease response to reduce economic losses due to coccidiosis."

SIGNIFICANCE: This review highlights recent advances in nanoparticle-enabled phytochemical delivery to enhance bioavailability, improve therapeutic outcomes, and enable targeted applications. By comparing various nanoparticle systems, formulation methods, and efficacy data, it identifies gaps in current research and guides the development of more effective, next-generation phytochemical-loaded nanocarriers. METHODS: A systematic review of literature published between 2000 and 2024 was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Articles focusing on nanoparticle-based phytochemical delivery in cancer therapy were included. KEY FINDINGS: Compounds such as curcumin, resveratrol, quercetin, and epigallocatechin gallate demonstrate enhanced anti-cancer efficacy when encapsulated in nanoparticles, leading to improved bioavailability, increased tumor cell targeting, and reduced toxicity. Clinical trials indicate tumor regression and fewer adverse effects. Emerging approaches-such as nanogels, hybrid nanoparticles, and combination therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors-further refine treatment efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Nanoparticle-based delivery systems significantly improve the therapeutic potential of phytochemicals, making them promising candidates for safer, more effective cancer treatments. However, challenges related to regulatory guidelines, scalability, and long-term safety must be addressed to fully realize their clinical potential."

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly and is characterized by the aggregation of Aβ (peptide) and neurofibrillary tangles along with inflammatory processes. Aging is a significant driver of these alterations, and dementia is a major cause of disability and mortality. Despite extensive clinical trials over the past two decades, no effective drug has been developed to improve AD symptoms or slow its progression, indicating the inefficiency of current treatment targets. In AD development, the molecular microenvironment plays a significant role. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a key component of this microenvironment, regulate post-transcriptional gene expression, and are expressed more abundantly in the brain than in other tissues. Several dysregulated miRNAs in AD have been linked to neuropathological changes, such as plaque and tangle accrual, as well as altered expression of notorious molecules. Preclinical studies have confirmed the efficacy of phytochemicals/food bioactive compounds (PCs/FBCs) in regulating miRNA expression, which makes them immensely beneficial for targeting miRNA-altered expression patterns in neuronal diseases. This review highlights the potential of miRNAs in driving AD pathology and its development. Furthermore, it discusses the therapeutic efficacy of PCs/FBCs and their miRNA-regulatory properties, especially focusing on antiinflammatory and antioxidant capacities for their development as effective AD agents."

      "abstract": "The rising incidence of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders underscores the urgent need for innovative and evidence based treatment strategies. Phosphodiesterase-1 (PDE1) is a dual-substrate (cAMP/cGMP) phosphodiesterase expressed in the central nervous system and peripheral areas, which modulates cyclic nucleotide signaling cascades. Inhibiting PDE1 enhances cAMP/cGMP levels, promoting neuronal plasticity and neuroprotection, making it a promising therapeutic strategy for neurological disorders. The pursuit of targeting this enzyme for treating neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders has faced obstacles due to the absence of potent, selective, and brain-penetrating inhibitors. This study aimed to identify potent PDE1 inhibitors by leveraging a diverse collection of bioactive molecules derived from Himalayan flora through computational screening methods. The four most promising hit molecules were chosen for further investigation and subjected to Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, binding free energy calculations, along with standard molecules. It was found that the hit molecules stigmast-7, corilagin and emblicanin-A had formed the most stable complexes, and also, the least binding free energy was observed for stigmast-7 among the hit molecules. Additionally, the pulling simulations indicated that stigmast-7 and corilagin were the most robust binders, and required the highest force to dissociate from the binding cavity completely. The umbrella sampling simulations also revealed the lowest binding free energy for corilagin and stigmast-7. The insights gained from this study provide a foundation for future research into PDE1-targeted therapies, highlighting the potential of Himalayan bioactive compounds in developing novel therapeutic interventions.",

To improve quality of life and preserve vital organ function in patients with HNC, there is a need for research into therapeutic regimes that would reduce the toxicity of the current therapeutic modalities. The use of a single approach has not been enough to completely eradicate this malignancy. Therefore, the use of adjuvants and combinatorial approaches, using molecules from natural compounds that have no or minimal side effects, is a growing area of research. One objective of this review was to clarify the potentiality of novel therapeutic strategies for HNC, such as the use of phytochemicals as adjuvants with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and use of nano-formulation for therapeutic delivery. Another objective of this review was to delineate the associated challenges in the clinical application of these therapies in HNC. Possible strategies for overcoming critical issues associated with the clinical application of phytochemicals for HNC are also discussed."

Hence, searching for new therapeutic options is of utmost priority. The present investigation evaluates the in-silico and in-vitro anticancer potential of phytochemicals of Piper chaba. The cytotoxicity results demonstrated that the plant extract exhibited significant anticancer activity, with IC50 values of 12.66 ± 0.25 µg/mL for HCT-116 and 19.49 ± 0.37 µg/mL for DU-145. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to explore the interaction of potential drug targets with the phytochemicals. Subsequently, pharmacokinetic parameters calculations were performed to evaluate the drug-likeness. Piperine exhibits the highest binding affinity for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) protein with a docking score of -9.71 kcal/mol. Sylvatine had a greater binding affinity for human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3) protein than the other phytochemicals. Isopiperine, chabamide, Piperlonguminine, Santamarine and Versalide only exhibited ligand activity for human IKK beta protein (inhibitor of kappa B kinase). Additionally, a principal component analysis was performed to strengthen the investigation's scope. These proposed phytochemicals are reported to possess potential VEGFR2, HER2 and human IKK beta inhibition. The best phytochemical hits have excellent binding affinity and hold a massive anticancer potential, opening up new avenues for prospective future investigations in cancer treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cupressus sempervirens is one of the conifer plants, that is used as an antimicrobial, antioxidant, anthelminthic, and many other health purposes. Rhipicephalus annulatus is one of the hard tick genera affecting the production and health of domestic animals in Egypt. Extensive use of chemical acaricides in the management of ticks caused acaricide resistance, environmental contamination, residues in meat and milk, and harmful effects on non-target species. For these reasons, there is an urgent need to create efficient, environmentally friendly acaricides. This work aimed to assay the essential oils and establish the phytochemical analysis of C. sempervirens extract, its effects against the semi-engorged females of R. annulatus, and discuss their possible control effects. RESULTS: Using the spray-dip method by C. sempervirens ethanol, methanol, distal water, and chloroform extracts at different concentrations (10-50%), revealed a decrease in the percentage of mobile female R. annulatius ticks, and increased mortality proportionally with days after treatments (14 days) and/or extract concentrations (10-50%). The ethanol extracts showed their strongest acaricidal effect, where the female mortality percentage reached 100% using all concentrations at the end of the examined period. In addition, the estimated LC50 and LC95 of C. sempervirens ethanolic extract were recorded as the lowest values (12.2% and 17%, respectively) after 14 days of treatment compared with other extract types. The 50% ethanolic extract of C. sempervirens (the most effective one) revealed the presence of bioactive metabolites i.e. flavonoids, tannins, and carbohydrates (TSS). Also, its total antioxidant capacity and potential free-radical activity (DPPH) were estimated. Using GC-MS, the extracted oil revealed the presence of four major compounds i.e., Eicosapentaenoic acid (50.85%), 10,12-Docosadiynedioic acid (27.58%),10-Undecynoic acid (14.28%) and Palmitic acid (5.42%). The efficiency of all phytochemicals and essential oils was discussed in the current study. CONCLUSION: The phytochemicals and essential oils found in C. sempervirens could enhance our understanding and help in developing potential strategies for controlling ticks in general and for R. annulatus, in particular, using environmentally friendly agents.",

      "abstract": "The misfolding and aggregation of alpha-synuclein play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), contributing to neuronal dysfunction, the formation of Lewy bodies, and the manifestation of motor symptoms characteristic of PD. Understanding these molecular mechanisms is imperative for advancing therapeutic strategies for this neurodegenerative disorder. Current treatment modalities primarily involve dopamine replacement drugs, which fail to halt or slow disease progression. This study employs in-silico methods, including molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, to comprehensively evaluate naturally derived phytochemicals (n = 875) with neuroprotective or therapeutic potential in PD. Among these compounds, Crebanine exhibited the least binding energy at 13.7 kcal/mol, while Alpinetin showed -  3.2 kcal/mol. The RMSD values remained consistent after approximately 60 ns and 40 ns for Crebanine and Alpinetin, respectively, indicating stable predicted models. These findings underscore the potential of phytocompounds as candidates for PD therapeutics and warrant further in vitro and in vivo investigations to validate their efficacy. This approach represents a promising avenue for developing novel treatments that target the underlying molecular mechanisms of PD."

Hence, the exploration of novel medicinal treatments for AKI management remains vital. Substances of medicine food homology (SMFH), referring to substances having characteristics of both food and medicine, have been applied in China for thousands years.They could be used for daily diets and body conditioning. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), with its naturally derived components and demonstrated effectiveness, presents distinctive benefits in AKI treatment. Numerous studies have shown that SMFH and TCM phytochemicals could function satisfactorily with nephroprotective effects and have a significant effect on alleviating AKI as well as its complications. In this review, the pathogenesis of AKI was illustrated. We concentrated on SMFH and TCM phytochemicals against AKI and tried to summarize the underlying mechanisms in various kinds of AKI, highlighting the crucial phytochemical components in AKI prevention and therapy. Besides, strategies for SMFH and TCM phytochemicals globalization are analysed. This review comprehensively reveals that SMFH and TCM phytochemicals exhibit promising potential for AKI intervention by targeting various signal pathways and targets, which would contribute to AKI's cognition, preventive treatments, as well as global promotion."

It is strongly associated with the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Given the increasing morbidity and mortality associated with metabolic syndrome, along with the limited availability of drug treatments, it is high time to investigate the pathogenesis of this condition and explore potential pharmacotherapies. Macrophages, well-known innate immune cells, play an essential role in maintaining tissue immune homeostasis and multiple physiological processes, including glucose and lipid metabolism, oxidative stress and inflammation. Emerging evidence indicates that the effects of macrophages in metabolic syndrome are linked to macrophage-mediated metaflammation. Phytochemicals derived from natural plants have been shown to exert therapeutic effects on metabolic syndrome by modulating macrophage function. In this review, we sort out the role of macrophage-mediated metaflammation in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome and summarise potential phytochemicals that target macrophages for the treatment of this condition."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Drug resistance remains a significant challenge in the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), leading to therapeutic failure and poor patient prognosis. Numerous mechanisms, including drug efflux pumps, altered tumor microenvironment (TME), and dysregulated cell death pathways, contribute to the development of resistance against conventional chemotherapeutic agents, immunotherapy, and targeted therapies. As resistance to traditional treatments continues to emerge, there is an urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies to overcome these challenges. Phytochemicals are naturally occurring bioactive compounds and have demonstrated remarkable potential in targeting multiple resistance mechanisms simultaneously. METHOD: This review comprehensively overviews the current understanding of drug resistance mechanisms in HNSCC and explores innovative strategies utilizing phytochemicals and their nanoformulations to overcome these resistance mechanisms, with a particular focus on recent developments and future perspectives in this field. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Phytochemicals with anticancer properties include a wide range of herbal-derived molecules such as flavonoids, stilbenes, curcuminoids, alkaloids, traditional Chinese medicine, and others. These compounds can modulate ATP-binding cassette transporters, reverse epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), target cancer stem cells (CSCs), and regulate various signaling pathways involved in drug resistance. The integration of phytochemicals into advanced nanoformulation systems has also shown a remarkable improvement in enhancing their bioavailability, stability, and targeted delivery to the TME, potentially improving their therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, the combination of phytochemicals with conventional chemotherapeutic agents, targeted molecular therapy, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has exhibited synergistic effects, offering a promising approach to restoring drug sensitivity in resistant HNSCC cells. CONCLUSION: Phytochemicals and their nanoformulations may improve response of HNSCC to therapy by alleviating drug resistance.",

Metastasis is a multi-step process by which cancer cells spread to distant tissues and organs beyond the primary site. The metastatic propagation of different cancers is under the surveillance of several regulating processes and factors related to cellular signaling pathways. Plant-derived phytochemicals are bioactive components of plants with a variety of biological and medicinal activities. Several phytochemicals have been shown to target various molecular factors in cancer cells to tackle metastasis. Sesquiterpene lactones, as a diverse group of plant-derived phytochemicals with a variety of biological activities, have been shown to suppress the promotion and progression of different cancer types by acting on multiple cell-signaling pathways. This review article briefly describes the process of metastasis and its components.

It is a critical component of many fundamental central nervous system (CNS) processes. Recently, a connection has been shown between Fyn malfunction and the pathogenic processes exhibited in neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is a significant factor in worldwide mortality and disability. Due to the rising demographic of elderly individuals, there is a projected increase in incidence of AD in the forthcoming years. This study aims to identify prospective phytochemicals that can be utilized in developing a new protein kinase inhibitor for the therapeutic intervention of AD. The lack of therapeutic interventions capable of preventing the progression of AD is a significant concern thus, it is imperative to identify potential targets. This study employed a virtual screening approach to discover potential Fyn-kinase inhibitors from Berberis lycium (B.ly.) phytoconstituents. Three molecules, Canadine, N-Methyltetrahydroberberine (N-MTHB), and Tetrahydroberberine (THB), were found to have a strong affinity for the binding pocket of Fyn kinase. The docked complexes B.ly. compounds with Fyn underwent all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to assess their stability and interactions. MD simulation analysis revealed that the identified compounds show promise as potential Fyn inhibitors, which may be implicated in the therapeutic management of AD."

      "abstract": "Infertility is a global health issue and is closely related to oxidative stress, which occurs when high concentrations of free radicals surpass the protective effects of antioxidant molecules and enzymes. Such imbalance causes damage to DNA, as well as cellular proteins and lipids, ultimately leading to the destruction of the blood-testis barrier. This, in turn, hinders spermatogenesis. Various plants and compounds have been employed in an attempt to reverse these damages, such as phenolic compounds. Therefore, this review aims to identify the main phytochemical phenolic compounds and their respective effects when used in the treatment of male infertility. Related information concerning phenolic phytochemical compounds was gathered from studies selected from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. The search was conducted using the combination of six terms: \"phenolic compounds\", \"male infertility\", \"testis\", \"spermatozoa\", \"testosterone\" and \"male fertility\". These compounds can raise testosterone levels, reduce lipid peroxidation, and improve tubular histoarchitecture in cases of subfertility associated with diabetes mellitus. They can also mitigate the damage caused by obesity by increasing serum testosterone, antioxidant activity, and sperm motility. When it comes to fertility problems caused by inorganic and organic pollutants, these compounds effectively restore the structure of the seminiferous tubules, increase testosterone levels, and improve sperm quality. Furthermore, phenolic phytochemical compounds have shown beneficial effects in countering the adverse impacts of certain drugs on testicular physiology by reducing apoptosis in testicular tissue, increasing the number of Leydig cells, and promoting spermatocyte production. However, while these compounds may have protective effects on sperm cryopreservation for in vitro fertilization, caution is needed as certain dosages can cause irreversible damage to sperm quality. Overall, plant extracts containing phenolic phytochemical compounds hold promise as a therapeutic avenue for treating infertility and subfertility caused by metabolic disorders and environmental pollutants.",

This challenge underscores the need to explore innovative approaches, such as multimodal immunotherapy. Phytochemicals, bioactive compounds derived from plants, have emerged as promising candidates for overcoming these barriers due to their immunomodulatory and antitumor properties. This review explores the synergistic potential of phytochemicals in enhancing immunotherapy by modulating immune responses, reprogramming the tumor microenvironment, and reducing immunosuppressive factors. Integrating phytochemicals with conventional immunotherapy strategies represents a novel approach to mitigating resistance and enhancing therapeutic outcomes. For instance, nab-paclitaxel has shown the potential in overcoming resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors, while QS-21 synergistically enhances the efficacy of tumor vaccines. Furthermore, we highlight recent advancements in leveraging nanotechnology to engineer phytochemicals for improved bioavailability and targeted delivery. These innovations hold great promise for optimizing the clinical application of phytochemicals.

While tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as Imatinib have improved outcomes, resistance due to secondary mutations remains a significant challenge. This study used computational methods to identify phytochemicals from Moroccan plants as dual inhibitors of c-KIT and PDGFRα. Screening 545 phytochemicals, 6-Hydroxygenistein (6-OHG), a derivative of Genistein, showed high binding affinities (-10.3 kcal/mol for PDGFRα and -10.5 kcal/mol for c-KIT), comparable to Imatinib. 6-OHG demonstrated competitive binding affinities, favorable ADMET properties, good solubility, and oral bioavailability. Its antioxidant properties suggest a potentially lower toxicity profile. Interaction analysis revealed significant hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with key residues in both targets. Molecular dynamics simulations over 30 ns indicated stable complexes with consistent RMSD values, radius of gyration, solvent-accessible surface area, and hydrogen bonding patterns. Free binding energy calculations using the MM-PBSA method highlighted strong binding efficacy, with total binding energies of -278.0kcal/mol for PDGFRα and -202.1kcal/mol for c-KIT, surpassing Imatinib. These findings suggest that 6-OHG is a promising dual inhibitor for GIST therapy, potentially overcoming resistance mechanisms associated with current TKIs.

This process is closely linked to the onset and progression of various heart diseases. Modern pharmacological research has demonstrated that phytochemicals can regulate mitochondrial homeostasis in cardiomyocytes through multiple mechanisms, influencing mitophagy and protecting cardiomyocytes, which in turn exerts anti-cardiovascular effects. However, the underlying mechanisms of these effects are not yet fully understood. This study summarizes the pharmacological effects and molecular mechanisms of mitophagy in heart diseases, aiming to provide reference for the research and treatment of phytochemicals targeting mitophagy against heart diseases. The results indicated that phytochemicals (such as Berberine, Ginsenoside Rg1, Quercetin, Resveratrol, Baicalein, and so on) can exert preventive and therapeutic effects on heart diseases (such as cardiac toxicity or damage, myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, heart failure, heart aging, cardiac hypertrophy, cardiomyopathy, and so on.) via regulating the PINK1/Parkin and FUNDC1-dependent mitophagy pathway. These compounds mainly exert their effects by regulating mitochondrial homeostasis, mitochondrial dynamics, mitochondrial oxidative stress, mitochondrial apoptosis, and mitochondrial energy metabolism. This study provides a reference that phytochemicals have effect on anti-cardiovascular effects by regulating mitophagy.

As a food rich in a variety of active ingredients, Zingiber striolatum (Z. striolatum) exhibits hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects. However, the regulatory influence of Z. striolatum ethanol extract (ZSE) on the gut microbiota of T2DM mice or its potential relationship with T2DM pathology remains unexplored. METHODS: After a one-week acclimation period, 12 mice were randomly selected as the normal group. The remaining 48 mice were employed T2DM model, and then randomly assigned to four groups: the model group, a low-dose ZSE group (ZSE-L, 100 mg/kg/day), a high-dose ZSE group (ZSE-H, 300 mg/kg/day), and a positive control group treated with metformin hydrochloride (MET, 100 mg/kg/day). RESULTS: After a 4-week intervention, the results revealed that ZSE significantly ameliorated fasting blood glucose (FBG), area under the curve of oral glucose tolerance test (AUC of OGTT) and glycated serum protein (GSP) in T2DM mice. Moreover, the high-dose (ZSE-H) treatment increased the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Faecalibaculum, while reducing harmful bacteria such as Bilophila, thereby alleviating insulin resistance. Additionally, ZSE-H demonstrated superior efficacy over low-dose (ZSE-L) in improving FBG, AUC of OGTT, and other hypoglycemic parameters. Predictive analysis of the correlation between gut microbiota and hypoglycemic parameters identified Dubosiella, Bacillus, and Mailhella as potential microbial biomarkers for further investigation into the pathogenesis of T2DM. CONCLUSION: ZSE plays a pivotal role in mitigating hyperglycemia in T2DM mice through the modulation of intestinal microbiota communities."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease involving a network of numerous extracellular signal transduction pathways. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine/threonine kinase (Akt)/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is crucial for understanding the BC development. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), mTOR, Akt, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), FoxO1, glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), mouse double minute 2 (MDM2), H-Ras, and proapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family protein (BAD) proteins are key drivers of this pathway and potential therapeutic targets. Pleurotus ostreatus is an edible mushroom that is rich in flavonoids and phenols that can serve as potential inhibitors of proteins in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. AIM: This study evaluated the anticancer properties of P ostreatus through a structure-based virtual screening of 22 biologically active compounds present in the mushroom. METHOD: Model optimization was carried out on PI3K, PTEN, mTOR, Akt, PDK1, FoxO1, GSK-3, MDM2, H-Ras, and BAD proteins in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and molecular docking of compounds/control inhibitors in the binding pocket were simulated AutoDock Vina in PyRx. The drug likeness, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic features of prospective docking leads were all anticipated. RESULT: Several potent inhibitors of the selected key driver proteins in PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway were identified from P ostreatus. Ellagic acid with binding affinities of -8.0, -8.0, -8.1, -8.2, -6.2, and -7.1 kcal/mol on PI3K, Akt, PDK1, GSK-3, MDM2, and BAD, respectively, had better binding affinity compared with their reference drugs. Likewise, apigenin (-7.8 kcal/mol), chrysin (-7.8 kcal/mol), quercetin (-6.4 kcal/mol), and chlorogenic acid (-6.2 kcal/mol) had better binding affinities to PTEN, mTOR, FoxO1, and H-Ras proteins, respectively. CONCLUSION: Ellagic acid, apigenin, luteolin, quercetin, chlorogenic acid, chrysin, and naringenin phytochemicals are seen as the better lead molecules due to their ability to strongly bind to the proteins under study in this pathway. Analogs of these compounds can also be designed as potential drugs."

      "abstract": "The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is central in regulating key cellular processes such as proliferation, survival, metabolism, and angiogenesis. Dysregulation of this pathway, particularly in the AKT2 isoform, is commonly observed in cancers such as breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers, leading to enhanced tumor progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. Therefore, targeting AKT2 for inhibition is a promising strategy for cancer therapy. This study utilized molecular docking and dynamics simulations to identify natural phytochemicals that inhibit AKT2. Molecular docking results revealed that millettone (CID 442810) exhibited the highest binding affinity to AKT2, with a docking score of -9.5 kcal/mol, followed by uzarigenin (CID 92760), dihydrobiochanin A (CID 439784), and abyssinone I (CID 442152) with docking scores of -9.0 kcal/mol, -8.9 kcal/mol, and -8.7 kcal/mol respectively, outperforming the control inhibitor, ipatasertib (CID 24788740) docking score of -7.56 kcal/mol. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that millettone, uzarigenin, and dihydrobiochanin A demonstrated strong binding affinities and stable interactions with AKT2, suggesting their potential as therapeutic agents for cancers that involve AKT2 hyperactivation. Notably, uzarigenin's superior stability, as evidenced by its lower root mean square deviation (RMSD), which measures structural stability, and solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), which indicates molecular compactness, highlights its promise as a potent inhibitor of AKT2. Future in vitro and in vivo studies will be crucial to confirm the efficacy of these inhibitors in reducing tumor progression and their potential applications. Given that AKT2 also plays a role in neuronal survival and plasticity, these compounds may have potential applications in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, warranting further investigation into their dual therapeutic relevance."

      "abstract": "Cancer is the second foremost cause of fatalities associated with non-communicable diseases across the globe, affecting multiple organs and often necessitating costly treatments with adverse side effects. Apoptosis, the body's natural cell death process, plays a crucial role in the prevention of cancer, but it's often disrupted in cancer cells, allowing uncontrolled proliferation. Restoring apoptosis in cancer cells is one of the promising therapeutic strategies to curb tumor growth and enhance clinical outcomes. Bcl-B, an anti-apoptotic protein within the Bcl-2 family, interacts with Bax to mitigate apoptosis, indicating it as a druggable target for cancer therapy. There's a critical need for natural, cost-effective alternatives with minimal adverse effects to reduce morbidity rates of cancer patients. Plant-based immunoprotective medications, particularly from sustainable sources like known medicinal plants, offer substantial potential for cancer treatment. This study involves comprehensive in silico approaches (byte) to evaluate the inhibition potential of the phytochemicals derived from Withania somnifera against the anti-apoptotic Bcl-B protein. Research into Bcl-B's binding affinity with 80 phytochemicals from this plant aims to identify interaction sites for promising anticancer agents. This study's focus on Bcl-B protein highlights its potential in modulating apoptotic pathways and exploring novel anti-cancer therapeutics. Through comprehensive screening based on drug-likeness and pharmacokinetic properties, combined with in-house virtual screening, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and MM/PBSA-based binding free energy analysis, three promising candidate inhibitors-Withanolide L (IMPHY009438), Withanolide M (IMPHY003143), and Withanolide A (IMPHY000090)-were identified and prioritized. These candidates showed favorable estimated binding free energy values, along with desirable drug-likeness and pharmacokinetic profiles. The results demonstrated that the selected and prioritized phytochemicals, Withanolide L, Withanolide M, and Withanolide A display comparable efficacy to Obatoclax (CID: 11404337) and other known synthetic, semi-synthetic, and natural inhibitors of Bcl-2 family proteins. These findings establish a strong bench foundation for further experimental validation and bedside application, potentially offering an alternative natural approach to cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Mycobacterium is an acid-fast, aerobic, non-motile, and biofilm-forming bacterium. The increasing prevalence of mycobacterial infections makes it necessary to find new methods to combat the resistance of bacteria to conventional antibiotics. Mycobacterium abscessus is an emerging pathogen that is intrinsically drug resistant due to several factors, including an impermeable cell envelope, drug efflux pumps, target-modifying enzymes, and the ability to form thick, robust biofilms. Phytochemicals are promising antimicrobials; however, their poor solubility in water and their inability to penetrate biofilms render them inefficient in killing bacterial biofilms. In this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of polymer-stabilized phytochemical nanoemulsions in killing M. abscessus biofilms. These nanoemulsions improve the solubility and stability of the phytochemicals and enable biofilm penetration and eradication. We show that the phytochemical emulsions effectively eliminated M. abscessus in an in vitro biofilm model and killed non-replicating persister cells in the Wayne hypoxia model. These nanoemulsions were also effective in vivo in a wound infection model. These findings demonstrate the potential of polymer-stabilized phytochemical nanoemulsions as a promising alternative to conventional antibiotics for the treatment of mycobacterial infections. IMPORTANCE: Mycobacterium abscessus is among the opportunistic bacterial pathogens that cause nontuberculous mycobacterial diseases. The infection caused by M. abscessus is difficult to treat because the bacterium is resistant to many of the currently available antibiotics, limiting chemotherapeutic strategies. Furthermore, it forms biofilms in clinically relevant settings, making the infection difficult to treat. Many phytochemicals have potent antimicrobial activities, but their hydrophobicity limits clinical applications. In this study, we tested a new drug delivery strategy where hydrophobic plant phytochemicals were emulsified with a biodegradable nanosponge. We show that the emulsification makes phytochemicals such as carvacrol and eugenol more effective against M. abscessus biofilms. We further demonstrate that nanoemulsified phytochemicals can kill hypoxia-induced dormant M. abscessus and effectively improve skin wound infection in mice. Our data pave the way to use phytochemical nanosponge as a platform to create synergy by combining other antimycobacterial drugs.",

      "abstract": "In preclinical studies, bioactive phytochemicals have shown enormous potential therapeutic efficacy against various human malignancies. These natural compounds have been shown to possess an inherent potential to alter the molecular signaling pathways and epigenetic modulatory activity involved in multiple physiological functions. Recently, epigenetic therapy has emerged as an important therapeutic modality due to the reversible nature of epigenetic alterations. To date, epigenetic modulatory compounds, for example, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors 5-azacytidine and 5'-deoxyazacytidine, as well as histone deacetylase inhibitors Vorinostat, Romidepsin, and Belinostat (PXD101), have been clinically approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients of leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. However, these synthetic epigenetic inhibitors are not as effective against many of the solid tumors. Therefore, the epigenetic modulatory phytochemicals provide new hope for improving the treatment modality as neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy. It has been established that targeting more than one protein in the transformed cells simultaneously, that is, the multi-targeted therapeutic approach, might invoke a better therapeutic response. Therefore, here, we are compiling diverse evidences of the translational potential of novel combinatorial approaches utilizing the epigenetic modulatory phytochemicals with available therapeutics in the course of cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Leishmaniasis is a tropical parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Leishmania which remains a significant global health concern with diverse clinical manifestations. Transmitted through the bite of an infected sandfly, its progression depends on the interplay between the host immune response and the parasite. The disease outcome is linked to macrophage polarisation into M1 and M2 phenotypes. M1 macrophages are pro-inflammatory and promote parasite clearance, while M2 macrophages support tissue repair and parasite survival by facilitating promastigote entry and intracellular amastigote proliferation. PURPOSE: The review focuses on discovering novel phytochemicals that exploit the immunomodulatory properties of macrophages, which can serve as an alternative antileishmanial treatments due to their diverse chemical structures and ability to modulate immune responses. It examines the immunomodulatory effects of phytochemicals that directly or indirectly promote antileishmanial activity by influencing macrophage polarisation and cytokine secretion. They can induce M1 macrophage polarisation to directly combat leishmaniasis or suppress M2 macrophages, thereby exerting indirect antileishmanial activity by influencing the release of M1-and M2-related cytokines. RESULTS & DISCUSSION: Phytochemicals demonstrate antileishmanial effects through ROS production, M1 activation, and cytokine modulation. They regulate M1/M2-related cytokines and macrophage activity, influencing immune responses. Although their effects may be non-specific, targeted delivery strategies could overcome current therapeutic limitations, positioning phytochemicals as promising candidates for leishmaniasis treatment to counter the limitations of current medications.",

Important findings from prior studies are synthesized to explore these compounds' sources, mechanisms of action, complementary and synergistic effects, and associated side effects. It was reviewed that the exposure to certain doses of catechins, piperlongumine, lycopene, isoflavones and cucurbitacinfor a sufficient period can provide profound anticancer benefits through biological events such as cell cycle arrest, cells undergoing apoptosis and disruption of signaling pathways including, but not limited to JAK-STAT3, HER2-integrin, and MAPK. Besides, the study also covers the potential adverse effects of these phytochemicals. Regarding mechanisms, the widest attention is paid to Complementary and synergistic strategies are discussed which indicate that it would be realistic to alter the dosage and delivery systems of liposomes, nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, and films to enhance efficacy. Future research directions include refining these delivery approaches, further elucidating molecular mechanisms, and conducting clinical trials to validate findings.

It compromises the effectiveness of conventional antibiotics, as well as fundamental medical procedures, such as surgery and cancer treatment. Phytochemicals, natural plant constituents, and biogenic nanoparticles synthesized through biological processes are pharmacological alternatives for supplementing or replacing traditional antibiotics. These natural compounds exhibit a diverse range of bioactive properties, including antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities, and have the potential to overcome bacterial resistance mechanisms. However, their limited solubility, bioavailability, and stability have limited their therapeutic potential. Nanotechnology, particularly the utilization of biogenic nanoparticles, offers the potential to overcome these limitations by enhancing the biosafety, stability, and controlled release of phytochemical compounds, thereby enabling a more effective combination of resistant pathogens. This review examines current research on the combinatorial application of phytochemicals and biogenic nanoparticles, with emphasis on their capacity to address AMR. This study presents a novel perspective on the concurrent utilization of phytochemicals and biogenic nanoparticles, which may enhance antibacterial efficacy while mitigating toxicity. This review provides specific and innovative insights into the novelty, sustainability, and eco-friendly aspects of these approaches to address multidrug-resistant infections, highlighting their role in emerging as a transformative strategy for AMR management through the integration of natural and biogenic resources.",

The pathophysiological pathway of AD consists of Aβ-amyloid peptides, tau proteins, and oxidative stress in neurons and increased neuro-inflammatory response. Food and Drug Administration in the United States has authorized various drugs for the effective treatment of AD, which include galantamine, rivastigmine, donepezil, memantine, sodium oligomannate, lecanemab, and aducanumab. The major disadvantage of these drugs is that they only provide \"symptomatic\" relief. They are most effective in the early stages or for mild to moderate cases of the disease, but are not suitable for long-term use. Besides conventional therapies, phytochemicals have the potential to stop the progression of AD. According to research, the use of potential phytochemicals against AD has gained attention due to their potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein, metal chelation, and anti-amyloid properties. This study seeks to provide an up-to-date compilation of the most current and promising breakthroughs in AD therapy using phytochemicals. It could be concluded that phytochemicals light serve as an effective therapy for AD.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review explores the mechanistic pathways and clinical implications of phytochemicals in obesity management, addressing the global health crisis of obesity and the pressing need for effective, natural strategies to combat this epidemic. RECENT FINDINGS: Phytochemicals demonstrate significant potential in obesity control through various molecular mechanisms. These include the modulation of adipogenesis, regulation of lipid metabolism, enhancement of energy expenditure, and suppression of appetite. Recent studies have provided compelling clinical evidence supporting the use of specific phytochemicals in obesity treatment. Notable among these are green tea extract, rich in catechins; garcinia cambogia, containing hydroxycitric acid; resveratrol, found in grapes and berries; and berberine, derived from various plants. These compounds have shown promising results in clinical trials, Recent studies show that phytochemicals contribute to weight loss, BMI reduction, and lipid profile improvement, highlighting their potential in managing obesity and associated comorbidities. However, research in this field also faces challenges, including inconsistent bioavailability and the need for standardized dosing protocols. Phytochemicals offer a promising avenue for obesity management, acting through multiple pathways to influence weight control. While clinical evidence supports the efficacy of certain phytochemicals, further research and rigorous clinical validation are necessary to fully understand their potential and overcome existing challenges. This review underscores the importance of continued investigation into phytochemicals as a complementary approach to addressing the global obesity epidemic, potentially leading to more effective and natural interventions for weight management.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a complicated, multifaceted, neurodegenerative illness that places an increasing strain on healthcare systems. Due to increasing malfunction and death of nerve cells, the person suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) slowly and steadily loses their memories, cognitive functions and even their personality. Although medications may temporarily enhance memory, there are currently no permanent therapies that can halt or cure this irreversible neurodegenerative process. Nonetheless, fast progress in comprehending the cellular and molecular abnormalities responsible for neuronal degeneration has increased confidence in the development of viable prevention and treatments. All FDA-approved anti-AD medications have merely symptomatic effects and cannot cure the illness. This necessitates the pursuit of alternate treatments. Accumulating data shows that systemic neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and associated mitochondrial dysfunction play crucial roles in the etiology of AD and precede its clinical presentation. Therefore, innovative therapeutic approaches targeting these pathophysiological components of Alzheimer's disease are being explored aggressively in the present scenario. Phytochemicals such as resveratrol, curcumin, quercetin, genistein and catechins are prospective therapies owing to their capacity to alter key AD pathogenetic pathways, such as oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. The use of new phytochemical delivery strategies would certainly provide the possibility to solve several issues with standard anti-AD medicines. In this review, the roles of phytophenolic compound-based treatment strategies for AD are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is a common pathotype of E. coli that causes numerous outbreaks of foodborne illnesses. EHEC is a zoonotic pathogen that is transmitted from animals to humans. Ruminants, particularly cattle, are considered important reservoirs for virulent EHEC strains. Humans can become infected with EHEC through the consumption of contaminated food and water or through direct contact with infected animals or humans. E. coli O157:H7 is one of the most commonly reported causes of foodborne illnesses in developed countries. The formation of attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions on the intestinal epithelium, combined with Shiga toxin production, is a hallmark of EHEC infection and can lead to lethal hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). For the phage-dependent regulation of Shiga toxin production, antibiotic treatment is contraindicated, as it may exacerbate toxin production, limiting therapeutic options to supportive care. In response to this challenge and the growing threat of antibiotic resistance, phytochemicals have emerged as promising antivirulence agents. These plant-derived compounds target bacterial virulence mechanisms without promoting resistance. Therefore, the aim of this study is to summarize the recent knowledge on the use of phytochemicals targeting EHEC. We focused on the molecular basis of their action, targeting the principal virulence determinants of EHEC.",

      "abstract": "There is a growing interest in harnessing natural compounds and bioactive phytochemicals to accelerate drug discovery and development, including in the treatment of human cancers. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are critical regulators of many fundamental cellular processes and have been implicated in cancer pathogenesis as well as targets for anticancer drug development. The members of TAM, Tyro3, Axl, and MERTK subfamily RTKs, especially Mer, affect immune homeostasis in the tumor microenvironment. Hence, tyrosine-protein kinase Mer has emerged as one of the key factors in cancer susceptibility and metastasis and, by extension, as a potential target of relevance for cancer drug resistance. Here, we report, using an integrated virtual screening and simulation of phytochemicals from the IMPPAT 2.0 library, phytochemicals withanolide N and dryobalanolide as potential bioactive leads for developing anticancer drugs targeting tyrosine-protein kinase Mer. The study employed an integrated design, including physicochemical property analyses, binding affinity calculations, pan-assay interference compounds filtering, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity, and PASS analyses, in silico molecular dynamics simulations, followed by principal component analysis and free energy landscape. We call for further evaluation, validation, and translational medical research on these two phytochemicals in vitro and in vivo, with an eye to their putative therapeutic efficacy and safety in the field of oncology and anticancer drug discovery and development.",

      "abstract": "Anemia is a potentially life-threatening blood disorder caused by an insufficient erythroblast volume in the circulatory system. Self-renewal failure of erythroblast progenitors is one of the key pathological factors leading to erythroblast deficiency. However, there are currently no effective drugs that selectively target this process. In this work, we present a carbon dot (CP-CDs) derived from phytochemicals that significantly promotes the self-renewal of erythroblast progenitors for anemia therapy. As a superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like nanozyme, CP-CDs significantly activate the hypoxia response and JAK/STAT3 pathways in erythroid cells by reprogramming the oxidative stress state. This results in unique erythropoiesis-enhancing properties by promoting the generation of erythroid progenitor cells. Moreover, CP-CDs protect mature red blood cells by inhibiting oxidative stress-induced damage and improving the immune-inflammatory microenvironment. In vivo, CP-CDs showed a promising therapeutic effect in mouse and zebrafish models of anemia with minimal adverse effects, indicating significant translational medical value. Collectively, this study not only illustrates a successful approach for nanomedicine-enhanced anemia therapy but also enhances our understanding of the interaction between nanomedicine and the self-renewal of erythroblast progenitors.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by hyperglycemia due to insufficient insulin secretion or action. Contributing factors include genetic predisposition, obesity, family history, inactivity, and environmental risks. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the most common form, involves impaired insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells, leading to insulin resistance. By 2045, it is projected that India and China will have approximately 134.3 and 110.8 million diabetic individuals, respectively. Although synthetic drugs are effective in managing DM, they often come with side effects. Consequently, plant-based phytochemicals with antidiabetic properties are gaining attention. Research indicates that around 115 medicinal plants (MPs) have antidiabetic effects, particularly those from the Fabaceae, Liliaceae, and Lamiaceae families. Bioactive compounds like alkaloids, triterpenoids, flavonoids, and phenolics are known to combat DM. Traditional medicinal systems, particularly in developing countries, offer effective DM management. This review highlights the importance of MPs and their bioactive compounds in treating diabetes and underscores the need for further research to commercialize plant-based antidiabetic drugs."

      "abstract": "Angelica gigas Nakai (AGN) root is a medicinal herbal widely used in traditional medicine in Korea. AGN root ethanolic extracts have been marketed as dietary supplements in the United States for memory health and pain management. We have recently reviewed the pharmacokinetics (PK) and first-pass hepatic metabolism of ingested AGN supplements in humans for the signature pyranocoumarins decursin (D, Cmax 1x), decursinol angelate (DA, Cmax ~ 10x) and their common botanical precursor and hepatic metabolite decursinol (DOH, Cmax ~ 1000x). Here we update in vivo medicinal activities of AGN and/or its pyranocoumarins and furanocoumarin nodakenin in cancer, pain, memory loss, cerebral ischemia reperfusion stroke, metabolic syndrome and vascular endothelial dysfunctions, anxiety, sleep disorder, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. Given their polypharmacology nature, the pertinent mechanisms of action are likely misrepresented by many cell culture studies that did not consider the drug metabolism knowledge. We report here Rho-associated protein kinases (ROCK1/2) as novel targets for DA and DOH. Combining with published inhibitory activity of DOH on acetylcholinesterase, agonist activity of DOH and antagonist/degrader activity of DA/D on androgen and estrogen receptors, D/DA promoting activity for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)- gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibitory axis and inhibition of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), we postulate their contributions to neuro-cognitive, metabolic, oncologic, vascular and other beneficial bioactivities of AGN extracts. A clinical trial is being planned for an AGN extract to manage side effects of androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer patients.",

In psoriasis, this natural development of keratinocytes gets disturbed and aggregation of nucleated keratinocytes takes place in the epidermis of the skin, leading to the presence of scaly skin, which makes the patient physically, socially, and psychologically ill. Various natural, semisynthetic, and synthetic treatments are available. Still, semisynthetic or synthetic are mainly used to treat psoriasis with side effects on different parts of the body, which is life threatening. Various molecular target sites are getting upregulated such as Janus kinase/Signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STATs), phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), platelet selectin (Pan Selectin), Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-α), Interleukin-23 (IL-23), Interleukin-17 (IL-17), and Tyrosine Kinase 2 (Tyk2) in psoriasis. Plants and their bioactive compounds of flavonoids, alkaloids, resins, tannins, glycosides, and terpenoids category are used in the treatment of psoriasis as topical, oral, and biological forms. Using a computational approach, the inhibition of these molecular targets can be studied and potential molecules can be identified. This research article aims to find out the potential molecules that can inhibit the molecular sites and are effective than synthetic ones.",

      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain is a complex and debilitating condition resulting from nerve damage, characterized by sensations such as burning, tingling, and shooting pain. It is often associated with conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), and diabetic polyneuropathy. Conventional pain therapies frequently provide limited relief and are accompanied by significant side effects, emphasizing the need to explore alternative treatment options. Phytochemicals, which are bioactive compounds derived from plants, have gained attention for their potential in neuropathic pain management due to their diverse pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects. This review evaluates the mechanisms by which specific phytochemicals, such as curcumin, resveratrol, and capsaicin, influence neuropathic pain pathways, particularly their role in modulating inflammatory processes, reducing oxidative stress, and interacting with ion channels and signaling pathways. While curcumin and resveratrol are primarily considered dietary supplements, their roles in managing neuropathic pain require further clinical investigation to establish their efficacy and safety. In contrast, capsaicin is an active ingredient derived from chili peppers that has been developed into approved topical treatments widely used for managing neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain. However, not all phytochemicals have demonstrated consistent efficacy in managing neuropathic pain, and their effects can vary depending on the compound and the specific condition. The pathophysiology of neuropathic pain, involving maladaptive changes in the somatosensory nervous system, peripheral and central sensitization, and glial cell activation, is also outlined. Overall, this review emphasizes the need for continued high-quality clinical studies to fully establish the therapeutic potential of phytochemicals in neuropathic pain management.",

      "abstract": "Evidence suggests that a healthy gut microbiome is essential for metabolizing dietary phytochemicals. However, the microbiome's role in metabolite production and the influence of gut dysbiosis on this process remain unclear. Further, studies on the relationship among gut microbes, metabolites, and biological activities of phytochemicals are limited. We addressed this knowledge gap using strawberry phytochemicals as a model. C57BL/6J mice were fed a standard diet [C]; strawberry-supplemented diet (~2 human servings) [CS]; strawberry-supplemented diet and treated with antibiotics (to deplete gut microbes) [CSA]; high-fat diet (HFD) [HF]; strawberry-supplemented HFD [HS]; and strawberry-supplemented HFD and treated with antibiotics [HSA] for 12 weeks. First, antibiotic treatment suppressed the production of selected metabolites (CSA vs. CS), and p-coumaric acid was identified as a strawberry-derived microbial metabolite. Second, HFD-induced dysbiosis negatively affected metabolite production (HS vs. HF), and hippuric acid was identified as a microbial metabolite in HFD conditions. Third, dietary strawberries improved HFD-induced vascular inflammation (HS vs. HF). However, antibiotic treatment reduced metabolite production and abolished the vascular effects of strawberries (HSA vs. HS), indicating the importance of gut microbes in mediating the vascular benefits of strawberries via metabolites. Fourth, strawberry supplementation decreased Coprobacillus that was positively associated with vascular inflammation, whereas it increased Lachnospiraceae that was negatively associated with vascular inflammation and positively associated with hippuric acid. Fifth, hippuric acid was negatively associated with vascular inflammation. Our study fills in some pieces of the giant puzzle regarding the influence of gut microbes on the biological activities of phytochemicals. HFD-induced gut dysbiosis negatively impacts metabolite production and a strong association exists among gut microbes, strawberry-derived microbial metabolites, and the vascular benefits of dietary strawberries. Further, our study provides significant proof of concept to warrant future research on the use of strawberries as a nutritional strategy to prevent vascular complications.",

Quorum sensing (QS), detection of density of cell population through gene regulation, has been found to play an important role in the production of biofilms. Biofilm formation can increase the severity of infections that can lead to morbidity or mortality. Bacteria living within biofilms have a higher pattern of adaptive resistance to antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance is a barrier in the treatment of biofilmsinduced acute to chronic infections such as post-surgery infections, surgery-associated wound infections, endocarditis, joint infections, burn-related wound infections occurred, ventilator-associated pneumonia, etc. So it is urgent to discover or find out potent new drugs in fight against infectious diseases such as biofilms-associated infections. Medicinal plants or herbs are a rich source for fighting with biofilms-mediated infections. Phytochemicals have exhibited significant effects in the prevention of biofilms formation against different bacteria that are causing infections. Purified compounds such as berberine, tetrandrine, embelin, xanthorrhizol, bakuchiol, etc., exhibited promising biofilm inhibition actions against different pathogenic bacteria. Plant extracts that contain several phytochemicals are evaluated for its biofilm's inhibition property, and have shown significant potential in biofilm formation. Antibiofilm agents act by distinct mechanisms such as inhibiting the adherence of biofilms in a surface, preventing the biofilm formations, disrupting the matured biofilms, etc. This study is intended to reiterate about possibilities of plant extracts and purified compounds in the treatment of the prevention of bacterial biofilms-related infections."

      "abstract": "Depression is one of the most common psychological disorders, and due to its high prevalence and mortality rates, it imposes a significant disease burden. Contemporary treatments for depression involve various synthetic drugs, which have limitations such as side effects, single targets, and slow onset of action. Unlike synthetic medications, phytochemicals offer the benefits of a multi-target and multi-pathway mode of treatment for depression. In this literature review, we describe the pharmacological actions, experimental models, and clinical trials of the antidepressant effects of various phytochemicals. Additionally, we summarize the potential mechanisms by which these phytochemicals prevent depression, including regulating neurotransmitters and their receptors, the HPA axis, inflammatory responses, managing oxidative stress, neuroplasticity, and the gut microbiome. Phytochemicals exert therapeutic effects through multiple pathways and targets, making traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) a promising adjunctive antidepressant for the prevention, alleviation, and treatment of depression. Therefore, this review aims to provide robust evidence for subsequent research into developing phytochemical resources as effective antidepressant agents.",

      "abstract": "The Crimean Congo virus has been reported to be a part of the spherical RNA-enveloped viruses from the Bunyaviridae family. Crimean Congo fever (CCHF) is a fatal disease with having fatality rate of up to 40%. It is declared endemic by the World Health Organization. Many outbreaks of CCHF have been reported over the years. Former studies on CCHF have reported that the nucleoprotein of CCHF, being a pivotal protein in the replication process of the virus, is a potential target for antiviral drugs. However, there is no specific drug that can be used to treat this fatal disease and laboratory testing is prohibited due to its pathogen level 4. This study aims to find a possible potential inhibitor of the nucleoprotein of CCHFV using modern techniques leading ultimately to the development of effective and natural drugs. In this study, a virtual screening procedure involving a docking process followed by the Molecular Dynamics method is used to find out the potential inhibitors of the nucleoprotein of CCHFV. Phytochemicals having pharmacological properties and approved by the Food and Drug Administration are docked over the nucleoprotein of CCHFV. The study signifies the use of Withanolide E as a drug for the treatment of CCHFV as the study depicts the potential of Withanolide E to inhibit the nucleoprotein of CCHFV using reliable and modern techniques.",

      "abstract": "The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is widespread and has been related to a variety of malignancies as well as infectious mononucleosis. Despite the lack of a vaccination, antiviral medications offer some therapy alternatives. The EBV BZLF1 gene significantly impacts viral replication and infection severity. The current study performed computer-assisted techniques to analyses the potential drug candidates against Epstein-Barr virus toxin Zta [Human gamma-herpesvirus 4 (Epstein-Barr virus)] from phytochemicals derived natural inhibitors. Various bioinformatics methods were employed to predict and analyze the toxin protein structure obtained from NCBI, and its secondary and tertiary structures were predicted using PSIPRED and the AlphaFold. ProtParam was used to assess physiochemical characteristics. Natural inhibitors were found in the literature and PubChem, tested with PyRx, and performed blind docking by using CB-Dock, then the top selected drug candidate from natural inhibitors was analyzed for possible drug development applications using preADMET, Molinspiration, and MD simulations. Density functional Theory analysis was executed to predict the transition energies and the reactivity. Imperatorin was the best candidate for developing the drug against toxin protein Zta coded by the BZLF1 gene because it exhibited the lowest binding energy (- 6.3 kcal/mol) during natural inhibitor screening. Imperatorin's compliance with Lipinski's Rule of 5 and favorable pharmacokinetics make it an ideal therapeutic agent against EBV. Since vaccines and medications are crucial for treating infectious diseases and cancer, computational approaches seem promising and less costly to design and discover potential drug candidates and vaccines with the help of in silico methods but further in vitro research is required for experimental validation.",

This systematic review meticulously evaluates the hepatoprotective properties of phytochemicals and plant extracts against chemotherapy-induced liver damage, primarily in experimental animal models. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, an exhaustive search was conducted across databases like SCOPUS, PubMed, and Web of Science, culminating in the inclusion of 61 pertinent studies. These studies illustrate those natural compounds, spanning a diverse array of phytochemicals and plant extracts that can effectively mitigate biochemical markers of liver damage, enhance antioxidant defences, and modulate inflammatory responses in model organisms subjected to hepatotoxic chemotherapeutic agents such as cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and doxorubicin. Notably, the natural agents reviewed have demonstrated significant reductions in liver enzymes, improved histopathological outcomes, and bolstered cellular antioxidant capacities. The systematic synthesis of data underscores the potential of these natural substances to diminish liver toxicity associated with chemotherapy in preclinical settings. However, the review also highlights critical gaps in research, notably the underreporting of molecular mechanisms and inconsistent data on clinical translatability. To optimize the therapeutic utility of these compounds, future studies should focus on detailed molecular analyses and rigorous clinical trials to validate efficacy and safety, paving the way for integrated approaches in oncological care that minimize hepatic complications.",

      "abstract": "Recent research has increasingly focused on phytochemicals as promising anticancer agents, with glucosinolates (GSLs) and their hydrolytic derivatives playing a central role. These sulfur-containing compounds, found in plants of the Brassicales order, are converted by myrosinase enzymes into biologically active products, primarily isothiocyanates (ITCs) and indoles, which exhibit significant anticancer properties. Indole-3-carbinol, diindolylmethane, sulforaphane (SFN), phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), benzyl isothiocyanate, and allyl isothiocyanate have shown potent anticancer effects in animal models, particularly in breast, prostate, lung, melanoma, bladder, hepatoma, and gastrointestinal cancers. Clinical studies further support the chemopreventive effects of SFN and PEITC, particularly in detoxifying carcinogens and altering biochemical markers in cancer patients. These compounds have demonstrated good bioavailability, low toxicity, and minimal adverse effects, supporting their potential therapeutic application. Their anticancer mechanisms include the modulation of reactive oxygen species, suppression of cancer-related signaling pathways, and direct interaction with tumor cell proteins. Additionally, semi-synthetic derivatives of GSLs have been developed to enhance anticancer efficacy. In conclusion, GSLs and their derivatives offer significant potential as both chemopreventive and therapeutic agents, warranting further clinical investigation to optimize their application in cancer treatment.",

However, targets and molecular mechanisms of Hemerocallis citrina Baroni edible flowers (HEF) in depression treatment are still unclear. The potential anti-depression targets in HEF were identified by the intersecting results from typical drug databases. The network construction and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis were carried out for core targets. The molecular docking was conducted to predict the binding affinity between the active components and the central targets. The intersecting results indicated that there were 24 active components in HEF, with 449 anti-depression targets identified. After screening through degree centrality (DC), betweenness centrality (BC), and closeness centrality (CC), 166 core targets were determined. Tumor protein 53 (TP53) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) had the highest degree values. The results of GO enrichment analysis associated with anti-depression revealed that the biological processes were negative regulation of osteoclast differentiation and positive regulation of phosphorus metabolic process. KEGG enrichment analysis results revealed that pathways, such as the phosphatidylinositol 3‑kinase-protein kinase B (PI3K-Akt) signaling pathway and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, were primarily associated with anti-depression. Molecular docking results indicated that the top 10 active ingredients in HEF could bind to the central targets. This study applied network pharmacology to unveil the potential anti-depressive mechanisms of HEF, providing a theoretical basis for further exploration of the effective components in H. citrina edible flower parts."

This diversity presents significant challenges for treatment and leads to poor prognosis. Surgery remains the primary treatment of choice for GBMs, but it often results in tumor recurrence due to complex interactions between GBM cells and the peritumoral brain zone. Phytochemicals have shown promising anticancer activity in in-vitro studies and are being investigated as potential treatments for various cancers, including GBM. However, some phytochemicals have failed to translate their efficacy to pre-clinical studies due to limited penetration into the tumor microenvironment, leading to high toxicity. Thus, combining phytochemicals with nanotechnology has emerged as a promising alternative for treating GBM. This review explores the potential of utilizing specific nanoparticles to deliver known anticancer phytochemicals directly to tumor cells. This method has demonstrated potential in overcoming the challenges of the complex GBM microenvironment, including the tight blood-brain barrier while minimizing damage to healthy brain tissue. Therefore, employing this interdisciplinary approach holds significant promise for developing effective phyto-nanomedicines for GBM and improving patient outcomes."

Until now, the treatment of C. acnes is mainly limited to antibiotics, but some strains of C. acnes produce antimicrobial resistances, making it difficult for clinical treatment. Additionally, antibiotics can cause severe adverse effects. Therefore, more and more people are paying attention to phytochemicals. It is well known that plants can synthesize a range of secondary metabolites, named phytochemicals, part of which have antibacterial properties. Additionally, the main advantages of phytochemicals are that they have good efficacies and less side effects, so they are suitable choices for medical treatment. This review mainly discusses the effects and mechanisms of phytochemicals against C. acnes."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Depression is a complex mental disease whose incidence increases every year; 300 million people worldwide currently suffer from it. Women are more likely to suffer from depression, twice the rate as men. It is one of the few illnesses that can lead to suicide, which makes it very dangerous - currently, 700,000 people die from suicide and it is the 4th most common cause of death in people aged 15-29. The treatment strategies for depression is a big challenge for physicians, pharmacists, scientists and classic remedies cause many side effects. Therefore, natural phytotherapy with herbs can prove to be a good solution. Phytotherapy is a popular treatment method used for centuries in Chinese medicine or Ayurveda. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study conducted a comprehensive database search PubMed, ClinicalKey and MedNar covered the years 2015 - 2024 to provide the most up-to-date data. 13 randomized controlled trials and 1 meta - analysis were included in the systematic review. RESULTS: Many plants show anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and cognitive enhancing effects, which are particularly important in depression. In the treatment of depression, plants such as Crocus sativus L. stigma, Lavandula angustifolia, Hypericum perforatum L. and Curcuma longa L. have proven to be effective. They show good effectiveness in human studies and alleviate the symptoms of depression. Herbal products can support classical pharmacotherapy, but this requires further research. Non-commercial clinical trials in the future should provide answers to research questions: at what stage of treatment of patients with MDD will the use of phytochemicals be most appropriate in terms of therapy efficacy and safety for the patient. CONCLUSIONS: Crocus sativus L. stigma, Lavandula angustifolia, Hypericum perforatum L. and Curcuma longa L. in modern medicine can help improve the well-being of patients with depression. The use of herbs as an intervention was associated with a decrease in the concentration of proinflammatory cytokines and an overall improvement in the mood of patients. Further research should be undertaken into combining both therapies in order to improve patients' quality of life and reduce treatment costs."

The phytochemical content of the extracts was analyzed using the LC-MS/MS technique, quantifying 53 phytochemicals. Additionally, the in vitro antioxidant properties and antibacterial activities of the extracts were evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis as gram-positive bacteria, and Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as gram-negative bacteria. According to the results, the extracts were rich in catechin, epicatechin, cyranoside, and chlorogenic acid. Extracts obtained via ultrasonic extraction demonstrated stronger antioxidant properties. The IC50 values for the DPPH radical scavenging activity of obtained extracts ranged between 0.0173 mg/mL and 0.0400 mg/mL. The highest total phenolic content was found in the UAE-M-4h extract (213.44 mg GAE/mL). The extracts prepared with UAE-MeOH-2h-4h, UAE-EtOH-2h-4h, Sbc-EtOH-E-140-60-80, Sc-90 atm, and Sc-400 atm showed antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria at varying rates (MIC range: 31.25 to 250 μg/mL). Based on the all results, the ultrasound assisted extraction proved superior to the other techniques. This study, utilizing three different extraction methods with varying variables such as temperature, pressure, and extraction time, has provided significant insights into which extraction method should be employed for isolating specific phytochemicals or for therapeutic purposes, based on the differing antibacterial results observed. The findings highlight the importance of selecting the appropriate extraction method depending on the target phytochemical or desired antibacterial effect in treatment applications."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Grape (Vitis vinifera L.) is one of the most important fruit products globally and has a high nutritional value with potent antioxidant and anti-cancer activities. In current years, phenylalanine application has been particularly noticed for enhancing the nutritional quality of horticultural crops. With the aim of quality improvement, the effects of foliar application of phenylalanine at 5 concentrations (0, 100, 500, 1000, and 2000 μM) on Vitis vinifera cv. 'Qzl Ouzum' berry compositions were studied. The studied parameters included antioxidant activity, phenolics, flavonoids, anthocyanin, catalase and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase enzyme activity, and phenolic compounds content based on HPLC analyses (myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, syringetin, catechin, gallic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, resveratrol). RESULTS: Phenylalanine at 1000 μM increased total phenols, flavonoids, anthocyanins, and PAL enzyme activity. In addition, HPLC analysis revealed a significant accumulation of individual phenolic compounds by phenylalanine treatment. The highest values were recorded in the treatments with 100 and 500 μM phenylalanine for most of the phenolic components. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR results showed that the expression of PAL and CHS genes was induced by phenylalanine. The highest PAL and CHS gene expression was observed at 500 μM and then at 1000 μM phenylalanine treatment. CONCLUSIONS: With the use of phenylalanine, the activity of the PAL and CHS enzyme and PAL and CHS gene expression were significantly increased and led to a greater accumulation of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activiety. This study suggests that the use of phenylalanine as a main precursor for the synthesis of phenolic compounds, can improve the phenolic composition of grapes and could be a practical approach to advance fruit quality in the production of grape cv. 'Qzl Ouzum'.",

Traditional treatments, including antivenom therapy, have limitations and associated risks. This research aims to discover novel phytochemical antidotes for snakebites, specifically targeting the western diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox) venom metalloproteinase Atrolysin. Utilizing pharmacoinformatic techniques such as molecular docking, high-throughput ligand screening, pharmacophore mapping, pharmacokinetic profiling, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we analyzed phytochemicals from the Indian Medicinal Plants, Phytochemistry And Therapeutics (IMPPAT) database alongside well-known nine metalloproteinase inhibitors from the PubChem database. From an initial set of 17,967 compounds, 4708 unique compounds were identified for further study. These compounds were evaluated based on drug likeness, molecular descriptors, ADME properties, and toxicity profiles. Binding site predictions and molecular docking identified key interacting residues and binding energies, highlighting several promising compounds. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis provided insights into these compounds' electronic properties and stability. MD simulations assessed the dynamic stability of protein-ligand complexes using parameters such as RMSD, RMSF, the radius of gyration, and hydrogen bond interactions. This study identified top candidates, including CID5291, IMPHY001495, IMPHY014737, IMPHY008983, IMPHY008176, and IMPHY003833, based on their favorable binding energies, interaction forces, and structural stability.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The rate of acute hepatitis C increased by 7% between 2020 and 2021, after the number of cases doubled between 2014 and 2020. With the current adoption of pan-genotypic HCV therapy, there is a need for improved availability and accessibility of this therapy. However, double and triple DAA-resistant variants have been identified in genotypes 1 and 5 with resistance-associated amino acid substitutions (RAASs) in NS3/4A, NS5A, and NS5B. The role of this research was to screen for novel potential NS5B inhibitors from the cannabis compound database (CBD) using Deep Learning. METHODS: Virtual screening of the CBD compounds was performed using a trained Graph Neural Network (GNN) deep learning model. Re-docking and conventional docking were used to validate the results for these ligands since some had rotatable bonds >10. About 31 of the top 67 hits from virtual screening and docking were selected after ADMET screening. To verify their candidacy, 6 random hits were taken for FEP/MD and Molecular Simulation Dynamics to confirm their candidacy. RESULTS: The top 200 compounds from the deep learning virtual screening were selected, and the virtual screening results were validated by re-docking and conventional docking. The ADMET profiles were optimal for 31 hits. Simulated complexes indicate that these hits are likely inhibitors with suitable binding affinities and FEP energies. Phytil Diphosphate and glucaric acid were suggested as possible ligands against NS5B."

      "abstract": "Squalene synthase (SQS) plays a crucial role in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Its distinctive strategic position makes it a promising candidate for targeting and developing new anti-hypercholesterolemic agents. To uncover novel phytochemical scaffolds as potential inhibitors of SQS, we employed a structure-based virtual screening approach that involves screening 545 phytochemicals collected from Moroccan aromatic and medicinal plants and filtering them based on RMSD values and their affinity towards the target enzyme. Furthermore, we visualized the interacting amino acid residues to gain insight into the 2D and 3D interactions. The docking process was validated through the re-docking method with the reference co-crystallized complex (PDB id = 3v66, SQS-D3A). The screening resulted in the identification of two phytochemicals, Apigenin 7-O-rutinoside, and Apigenin 7-O-glucuronide, with high affinity for SQS binding sites. Both phytochemicals interact with functionally essential residues of SQS. The drug-likeness and toxicity of the phytochemicals were assessed through ADME-Tox analysis. Later, molecular dynamics simulations were performed by GROMACS software for 100 ns to evaluate the stability and fluctuations of protein-ligand complexes. By examining the trajectories produced by the MD simulations, we monitored complex stability, fluctuation, atomic gyration, H-bond, PCA, and FES. The simulations demonstrated that the interaction between the target and the compounds was stable and consistent. Binding free energy calculations indicated that Apigenin 7-O-rutinoside and Apigenin 7-O-glucuronide exhibited higher binding free energy than the co-crystallized inhibitor (D3A), providing a basis for further research in vitro and in vivo to develop potent SQS inhibitors for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia."

This study aims to discover lead compounds from Salvia substolonifera that inhibit angiogenesis. As a result, an undescribed norditerpene lactone, substolide H (3), and eight known compounds (1, 2, and 4-9) have been isolated. The structure was elucidated using synthetic spectroscopy and electron circular dichroism. Compounds 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 inhibited human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) proliferation with IC50 values of 26.47, 6.10, 43.27, 36.81, and 35.11 µM, respectively. Compounds 2, 3, and 7 inhibited HUVEC migration with IC50 values of 12.48, 8.37, and 7.63 µM, respectively. Further studies have shown that the substolide H (3) suppresses tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and that intravitreous administration suppresses retinal neovascularization in oxygen-induced retinopathy mice. Turning to its mechanism of action, we have shown that the anti-angiogenic effect of the substolide H may be through the downregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor expression and the phosphorylation of VEGFR2, ERK1/2, and protein kinase B. Our study represents the first report of these anti-angiogenic compounds from this plant, and substolide H may be a potential candidate for the treatment of retinal neovascularization.",

To provoke inflammation, the whisker pads of rats were injected with complete Freund's adjuvant, and subsequently, mechanical stimuli were administered to the orofacial region to determine the escape threshold. Compared to naïve rats, the inflamed rats showed a significantly lower mechanical threshold, and this reduced threshold returned to normal levels two days post-administration of NRG, DIC, and half-dose DIC plus half-dose NRG (1/2 DIC + 1/2 NRG). Using extracellular single-unit recordings, the activity of SpVc wide-dynamic range neurons was measured in response to mechanical stimulation of the orofacial area under anesthesia. The average firing rate of SpVc neurons when exposed to both non-painful and painful mechanical stimuli was significantly reduced in inflamed rats following NRG, DIC, and 1/2 DIC + 1/2 NRG administration. The heightened average spontaneous activity of SpVc neurons in rats with inflammation was significantly reduced following NRG, DIC, and 1/2 DIC + 1/2 NRG administration. The increased average receptive field size observed in inflamed rats reverted to normal levels after either NRG, DIC, or 1/2 DIC + 1/2 NRG treatment. These findings indicate that NRG administration can reduce inflammatory hyperalgesia linked to the heightened excitability of SpVc wide-dynamic range neurons.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: MSSA and MRSA strains are challenging human pathogens that can develop resistance to antibiotics, highlighting the need for alternative antimicrobial agents. Plant metabolites, particularly volatile phytochemicals, may offer promising antimicrobial properties. The aim was to evaluate the antimicrobial and antibiofilm efficacy of various commercial volatile phytochemicals from the terpene and terpenoid groups against reference MSSA and MRSA strains, focusing on synergistic effects in both binary combinations and combinations with antibiotics. METHODS: The microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for antibiotics and phytochemicals. The checkerboard method assessed synergistic interactions between phytochemicals and between phytochemicals and antibiotics, while the time-kill method was used to confirm these results. Biofilm quantification was performed using the microtiter plate method to evaluate the effects of phytochemicals, antibiotics, and their binary combinations on the eradication of 48-h-old biofilms. RESULTS: Carvacrol and thymol demonstrated the strongest anti-staphylococcal activity, while other terpene compounds showed weaker effects. In binary combinations, carvacrol and thymol exhibited synergy against one MSSA strain (FICI = 0.50) and with tetracycline and chloramphenicol (FICI = 0.28-0.50). Synergy was also noted with streptomycin sulfate against one MRSA strain (FICI = 0.31-0.50) and with other antibiotics, including gentamicin (FICI = 0.25-0.50) and oxacillin (FICI = 0.44). Additionally, effective combinations achieved over 50% biofilm removal at both minimum inhibitory and sub-inhibitory concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that synergy varies based on strain sensitivity to chemical agents, highlighting their potential for personalized therapy. Despite the difficulty in removing preformed biofilms, the findings highlight the importance of combined treatments to enhance antibiotic effectiveness."

      "abstract": "Despite the advancement in cancer diagnosis and treatment, colorectal cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Given the high recurrence rate of colorectal cancer even after surgical resection, chemotherapy has been clinically used to improve the treatment outcomes of colorectal cancer. However, chemotherapy is well-known for its toxic side effects. Thus, phytochemicals have been widely studied in recent years as preventive and therapeutic agents for colorectal cancer owing to their relatively low toxicity. Moreover, combinatorial uses of phytochemicals with other natural compounds or with drugs may amplify the positive outcomes of colorectal cancer prevention and treatment by intervening in multiple signaling pathways and targets. This review summarized the combinatorial use of several well-studied groups of phytochemicals, that is, isothiocyanates, quinones, carotenoids, and alkaloids, in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer, and suggested it as a potential approach to improve the anticancer efficacy of single compounds and minimize the toxic side effects associated with conventional drugs. Notably, we generalized the in vitro, in vivo, and clinical experiments-based molecular mechanisms whereby the selected phytochemicals in combination with other compounds exerted anti-colorectal cancer effects by inhibiting cancer cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, cell invasion, and tumor growth. Overall, this review provides a reference and new perspective to propel further advancements in research and development of preventative and therapeutic strategies for colorectal cancer.",

      "abstract": "Cancer is a collection of illnesses characterized by aberrant cellular proliferation that can infiltrate or metastasize to distant anatomical sites, posing a notable threat to human well-being due to its substantial morbidity and death rates worldwide. The potential of plant-derived natural compounds as anticancer medicines has been assessed owing to their favorable attributes of few side effects and significant antitumor activity. Mangrove plants and their derived compounds have been scientifically shown to exhibit many significant beneficial biological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, neuroprotective, cardioprotective, and hepatoprotective properties. This study summarized mangrove plants and their derived compounds as potential anticancer agents, with an emphasis on the underlying molecular mechanisms. To explore this, we gathered data on the preclinical (in vivo and in vitro) anticancer effects of mangrove plants and their derived compounds from reputable literature spanning 2000 to 2023. We conducted thorough searches in various academic databases, including PubMed, ScienceDirect, Wiley Online, SpringerLink, Google Scholar, Scopus, and the Web of Science. The results demonstrated that mangrove plants and their derived compounds have promising anticancer properties in preclinical pharmacological test systems through various molecular mechanisms, including induction of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, autophagy, antiproliferative, antimetastatic, and other miscellaneous actions. Upon thorough observation of the pertinent information, it is suggested that mangrove plants and their derived chemicals may serve as a potential lead in the development of novel drugs for cancer therapy."

Type 2 diabetes (T2DM), usually associated with obesity, is characterized by elevated blood glucose levels, hyperlipidemia, chronic inflammation, impaired β-cell function, and insulin resistance. If left untreated or when poorly controlled, DM increases the risk of vascular complications such as hypertension, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy, which can be severely debilitating or life-threatening. Plant-based foods represent a promising natural approach for the management of T2DM due to the vast array of phytochemicals they contain. Numerous epidemiological studies have highlighted the importance of a diet rich in plant-based foods (vegetables, fruits, spices, and condiments) in the prevention and management of DM. Unlike conventional medications, such natural products are widely accessible, affordable, and generally free from adverse effects. Integrating plant-derived foods into the daily diet not only helps control the hyperglycemia observed in DM but also supports weight management in obese individuals and has broad health benefits. In this review, we provide an overview of the pathogenesis and current therapeutic management of DM, with a particular focus on the promising potential of plant-based foods.",

These metabolites have a long history in traditional medicine, with 42% of molecules approved for cancer treatment between 1981 and 2019 being either natural products or derivatives. The Cactaceae family, which comprises more than 1,500 species, represents a largely untapped source of potentially useful chemopreventive and anticancer agents. Although more than 3,000 plants and their derivatives have contributed to chemotherapeutic development, cactus species have received limited attention until recently. Emerging evidence highlights the anticancer potential of fruits, stems, and cladodes from various cactus species. This review provides a comprehensive and current overview of experimental studies on Cactaceae in cancer research, aiming to pave the way for the development of innovative, natural cancer therapeutics and contribute to the ongoing battle against this formidable disease."

      "abstract": "Lung malignancies are among the most prevalent and foremost causes of tumor-related deaths. Despite significant advancements in the understanding and management of lung cancer, resistance to traditional treatments remains a significant challenge. Understanding and targeting tumor microenvironment (TME) have attracted interest in the recent decade for eliminating various solid tumors. The lung TME has a crucial position in tumor expansion and therapy failure, driving it an engaging target for novel medicinal interventions. Plant-derived products offer a promising avenue for targeting TME due to their diverse chemical structures and biological activities. However, their clinical use is hindered by insufficient bioavailability and also possible systemic toxicity. The use of nanoparticles as delivery vehicles for natural products can overcome these challenges and enhance their therapeutic efficacy. This review article explores the potential of plant-derived products as medicinal agents for targeting lung TME. We provide an outline of the present knowledge of lung TME and explain the mechanisms by which plant-derived products can modulate key components of this microenvironment. The promising impacts and properties of nanoparticles for the delivery of these derivatives into lung tumors will also be discussed. We also review the preclinical and clinical findings for supporting the usefulness of these agents in targeting lung TME. Additionally, we highlight the challenges and forthcoming trends in the development of plant-derived products as targeted therapies for lung cancer, with a particular focus on combination therapies.",

Among the various modes of antimicrobial action, antimicrobial agents that act on membranes have the most promising efficacy. However, there are no consolidated reports on the shortcomings of these drugs, existing challenges, or the potential applications of phytochemicals that act on membranes. Therefore, in this review, we have addressed the challenges and focused on various phytochemicals as antimicrobial agents acting on the membranes of clinically important bacterial pathogens. Antibacterial phytochemicals comprise diverse group of agents found in a wide range of plants. These compounds have been found to disrupt cell membranes, inhibit enzymes, interfere with protein synthesis, generate reactive oxygen species, modulate quorum sensing, and inhibit bacterial adhesion, making them promising candidates for the development of novel antibacterial therapies. Recently, polyphenolic compounds have been reported to have proven efficacy against nosocomial multidrug-resistant pathogens. However, more high-quality studies, improved standards, and the adoption of rules and regulations are required to firmly confirm the clinical efficacy of phytochemicals derived from plants. Identifying potential challenges, thrust areas of research, and considering viable approaches is essential for the successful clinical translation of these compounds.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dengue virus (DENV) infection, spread by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, is a significant public health concern in tropical and subtropical regions. Among the four distinct serotypes of DENV (DENV-1 to DENV-4), DENV-2 is associated with the highest number of fatalities worldwide. However, there is no specific treatment available for dengue patients caused by DENV-2. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify inhibitory phytocompounds in silico in Vernonia cinerea (V. cinerea), a widely used traditional medicinal plant, for treating DENV-2 associated illnesses. METHODS: The chemical structures of 17 compounds from V. cinerea were sourced from the Indian Medicinal Plants, Phytochemistry, and Therapeutics (IMPPAT) database. These compounds underwent geometry optimization, were screened against nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1) of DENV-2, and further validated through molecular dynamics simulations (MDS). Baicalein, an established drug against DENV-2, was used for validation in molecular screening, MDS, and MM-GBSA analyses. RESULTS: Among these compounds, Beta-amyrin, Beta-amyrin acetate, Chrysoeriol, Isoorientin, and Luteolin showed promising potential as inhibitors of the NSP1 of DENV-2, supported by the results of thermodynamic properties, molecular orbitals, electrostatic potentials, spectral data and molecular screening. Besides, these compounds adhered to the Lipinski's \"rule of 5\", showing no hepatotoxicity/cytotoxicity, with mixed mutagenicity, immunotoxicity, and carcinogenicity. Furthermore, final validation through MDS confirmed their potential, demonstrating stable tendencies with significant inhibitory activities against NSP1 of DENV-2 over the control drug Baicalein. Among the screened compounds, Chrysoeriol emerged as the most promising inhibitor of NSP1 of DENV-2, followed by Luteolin and Isoorientin. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results suggest that Chrysoeriol is the best inhibitor of NSP1 of DENV-2, which could be evaluated as a therapeutic agent or a lead compound to treat and manage DENV-2 infections."

The research on small molecule inhibitors targeting PDGFRβ in cancer treatment has seen promising developments, but significant gaps remain. PDGFRβ, receptor tyrosine kinase, is overexpressed in various cancers and plays an important role in tumor progression, making it a potential therapeutic target. However, despite advances in identifying and characterizing PDGFRβ inhibitors, few have progressed to clinical trials, and the mechanistic details of PDGFRβ's interactions with small molecule inhibitors are still not fully understood. Moreover, the specificity and selectivity of these inhibitors remain challenging, as off-target effects can lead to unwanted toxicity. In this investigation, two compounds, Genostrychnine and Chelidonine, were discovered that help inhibit the kinase activity of PDGFRβ. These small molecules were identified by employing various parameters involved in the drug discovery process, such as Lipinski's rule of five (RO5), 2D similarity search and 3D pharmacophore-based virtual screening followed by MD simulation studies. The identified molecules were found to be effective and significantly bound with the PDGFRβ kinase domain. Overall, our findings demonstrate that these small drug-like compounds can be beneficial tools in studying the properties of PDGFRβ and can play a crucial role in the therapeutic development of cancers and other associated diseases."

Despite their potential, challenges such as poor oral bioavailability and instability in the gastrointestinal tract have limited their therapeutic use. Traditional intra/transdermal drug delivery systems offer some advantages over oral administration but still suffer from issues such as limited penetration depth, slow drug release rates, and inconsistent drug absorption. In contrast, microneedles (MNs) represent a significant advancement in intra/transdermal drug delivery by providing precise control over phytochemical delivery and enhanced penetration capabilities. By circumventing skin barriers, MNs directly access dermal layers rich in blood vessels and lymphatics, thus facilitating efficient phytochemical delivery. This review extensively discusses the obstacles of traditional oral delivery and the benefits of intra/transdermal delivery routes with a particular focus on the transformative potential of MNs for phytochemical delivery. This review explores the complexities of delivering phytochemicals through intra/transdermal routes, the development and types of MNs as innovative delivery tools, and the optimal design and properties of MNs for effective phytochemical delivery. Additionally, this review examines the versatile applications of MN-mediated phytochemical delivery, including its role in administering phytophotosensitizers for photodynamic therapy, and concludes with insights into relevant patents and future perspectives.",

      "abstract": "Hormone replacement therapy is used to treat postmenopausal syndrome caused by estrogen deficiency, but it has been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer. In India, Achyranthes aspera L. is traditionally used to treat menstrual problems; however, there is a lack of mechanistic evidence of its phytoestrogenicity. Therefore, this study investigated the estrogenic activity of A. aspera on estrogen-responsive MCF-7 breast cancer cells. In a cell proliferation assay, the MeOH fraction (100 μg/mL) exhibited the highest proliferation effect (PE) of 138 % (p < 0.001) and relative proliferation effect (RPE) of 96.5 %, compared to 17β-estradiol (0.01 μM: 143 % PE, p < 0.001; 100 % RPE). The MeOH fraction was shown to upregulate the oestrogen marker genes trefoil factor 1 and progesterone receptor by 20.14-23.94 folds and 10.83-14.83 folds, respectively. Twelve phenolics were identified by LC-MS/MS in the active MeOH fraction, i.e. quinic acid, kaempferol hexoside, kaempferol 3-O-(2″-O-galloyl)-glucoside)-β-D-glucoside, geniposide, 3-O-(6'-O-(9Z,12Z-octadecadienoyl)-β-D-glucopyranosyl)-stigmast-5,22E-dien-3β-ol, kaempferol-3-O-glucoside (astragalin), 3,30-di-O-methylellagic acid isomer, procyanidin, naringin, propapyriogenin A2, (3β,22E,24R)-23-methylergosta-5,7,22-trien-3-ol and 6-prenylapigenin. Through network pharmacology, the potential effects, and mechanisms of these compounds in osteoporosis were revealed. About 55 target genes were linked to osteoporosis. GO and KEGG enrichment suggest regulation of female reproductive hormone related signaling pathways, which are also associated with estrogen dependent osteoporosis. Molecular docking analysis of the compounds revealed potential interactions with hERα receptor for 3-O-(6'-O-(9Z,12Z-octadecadienoyl)-β-D-glucopyranosyl)-stigmast-5,22E-dien-3β-ol and kaempferol-3-O-glucoside (astragalin) (docking scores of -9.3 and -10.1 kcal/mol, respectively) as compared to 17β-estradiol (-9.3 kcal/mol). These results suggest the estrogenicity of A. aspera via an ERα-associated mechanism and support its traditional usage in the management of menopausal-related problems."

Enhancing the nutraceutical content of vegetables through postharvest abiotic stress, such as ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation, offers a promising solution to increase health benefits. This study developed a user-friendly, at-home UVB device designed to increase the phytochemical content in common vegetables like carrots, lettuce, and broccoli. The device applies UVB radiation (305-315 nm) to fresh-cut vegetables, optimizing exposure time and intensity to maximize nutraceutical enrichment. The results demonstrated that UVB exposure increased the phenolic content by 44% in carrots, 58% in broccoli, and 10% in lettuce, with chlorogenic acid levels rising by 367% in lettuce, 547% in broccoli, and 43% in carrots after 48 h of storage. UVB treatment also enhanced antioxidant activity by up to 41% in broccoli and anti-inflammatory potential by 22% in carrots. In terms of gene expression, UVB treatment upregulated UCP-1 expression by 555% in carrots, enhanced thermogenesis, and increased SIRT-1 and ATGL expression by over 200%, promoting lipid metabolism. This process provides a convenient and efficient method for consumers to boost the health benefits of their vegetables. The study concludes that UVB-induced abiotic stress is an effective strategy to improve vegetable nutritional quality, offering a novel approach to increasing bioactive compound intake and aiding in the prevention of diet-related diseases."

      "abstract": "Cancer remains a significant global health concern. The dysregulation of signaling networks in tumor cells greatly affects their functions. This review intends to explore phytochemicals possessing potent anticancer properties that specifically target the STAT3 signaling pathway, elucidating strategies and emphasizing their potential as promising candidates for cancer therapy. The review comprehensively examines various STAT3 inhibitors designed to disrupt the signaling cascade, including those targeting upstream activation, SH2 domain phosphorylation, DNA binding domain (DBD), N-terminal domain (NTD), nuclear translocation, and enhancing endogenous STAT3 negative regulators. A literature review was conducted to identify phytochemicals with anticancer activity targeting the STAT3 signaling pathway. Popular research databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, and ResearchGate were searched from the years 1989 - 2023 based on the keywords \"Cancer\", \"STAT3\", \"Phytochemicals\", \"Phytochemicals targeting STAT3 signaling\", \"upstream activation of STAT3\", \"SH2 domain of STAT3\", \"DBD of STAT3\", \"NTD of STAT3, \"endogenous negative regulators of STAT3\", or \"nuclear translocation of STAT3\", and their combinations. A total of 264 relevant studies were selected and analyzed based on the mechanisms of action and the efficacy of the phytocompounds. The majority of the discussed phytochemicals primarily focus on inhibiting upstream activation of STAT3. Additionally, flavonoid and terpenoid compounds exhibit multifaceted effects by targeting one or more checkpoints within the STAT3 pathway. Analysis reveals that phytochemicals targeting upstream activation predominantly belong to the classes of flavonoids and terpenoids, which hold significant promise as effective anticancer therapeutics. Future research in this field can be directed towards exploring and developing these scrutinized classes of phytochemicals to achieve desired therapeutic outcomes in cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Phytochemicals possess a wide range of anti-tumor properties, including the modulation of autophagy and regulation of programmed cell death. Autophagy is a critical process in cellular homeostasis and its dysregulation is associated with several pathological conditions, such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and diabetes. In cancer, autophagy plays a dual role by either promoting tumor growth or suppressing it, depending on the cellular context. During autophagy, autophagosomes engulf cytoplasmic components such as proteins and organelles. LC3-II (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II) is an established marker of autophagosome formation, making it central to autophagy monitoring in mammals. OBJECTIVE: To explore the regulatory role of phytochemicals in LC3-mediated autophagy and their potential therapeutic impact on cancer. The review emphasizes the involvement of autophagy in tumor promotion and suppression, particularly focusing on autophagy-related signaling pathways like oxidative stress through the NRF2 pathway, and its implications for genomic stability in cancer development. METHODS: The review focuses on a comprehensive analysis of bioactive compounds including Curcumin, Celastrol, Resveratrol, Kaempferol, Naringenin, Carvacrol, Farnesol, and Piperine. Literature on these compounds was examined to assess their influence on autophagy, LC3 expression, and tumor-related signaling pathways. A systematic literature search was conducted across databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to 2023. Studies were selected from prominent databases, focusing on their roles in cancer diagnosis and therapeutic interventions, particularly in relation to LC3-mediated mechanisms. RESULTS: Phytochemicals have been shown to modulate autophagy through the regulation of LC3-II levels and autophagic flux in cancer cells. The interaction between autophagy and other cellular pathways such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and epigenetic modulation highlights the complex role of autophagy in tumor biology. For instance, Curcumin and Resveratrol have been reported to either induce or inhibit autophagy depending on cancer type, influencing tumor progression and therapeutic responses. CONCLUSION: Targeting autophagy through LC3 modulation presents a promising strategy for cancer therapy. The dual role of autophagy in tumor suppression and promotion, however, necessitates careful consideration of the context in which autophagy is induced or inhibited. Future research should aim to delineate these context-specific roles and explore how phytochemicals can be optimized for therapeutic efficacy. Novel therapeutic strategies should focus on the use of bioactive compounds to fine-tune autophagy, thereby maximizing tumor suppression and inducing programmed cell death in cancer cells.",

Before 1940, unmodified products and derivatives accounted for 43% and 14% of NME registrations, respectively. Since then, the share of unmodified products has decreased to 9.5% of all approved NMEs, while the share of derivatives has increased to 28%.

A total of 525 one-day-old Ross 308 chicks were randomly allocated to 7 experimental diets with 5 replicates of 15 birds each in a completely randomized design. Experimental diets consisted of negative control (NC) without any additives and not challenged. The other 6 groups were challenged with mixed Eimeria and fed the basal diet with no additives (Positive Control, PC) or supplemented with Coxidine 100 (1 g / 1 kg), probiotic, synbiotic, Livacox T vaccine and phytobiotic additives based on the manufacturer's recommended dose. Body weight gain (WG), feed intake (FI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were recorded weekly. Oocysts per gram of excreta (OPG) were determined on d 25 to 33 and 42. One bird per cage was euthanized to analyze lesion score and jejunum and ileum inflammatory genes expression. Coccidial challenge reduced WG (P < 0.05) during 15 to 28 d and vaccine treatment was more effective in improving WG and FCR on d 29 to 42 and 1 to 42 (P < 0.05) than other treatments. Birds in the PC group had higher (P < 0.05) OPG than NC group for all days and the vaccine treatment resulted in the lowest rate of OPG compared to other treatments (P < 0.05) at 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, and 33 d of age and overall average. Relative mRNA levels of IFN-γ, IL-1β and IL-10 were significantly upregulated among treatments under coccidiosis challenge in jejunum and ileum except for IL-1β expression in the ileum. In conclusion, based on the results of this study the individual characteristics of feed additives for the prevention of coccidiosis can be different depending on the type and source of feed additives, duration, and amount used, levels of oocyst inoculation and Eimeria types.",

Addressing this issue requires the use of effective anti-inflammatory strategies with fewer side effects than those provoked by currently used drugs. In this study, a range of phytochemicals (phenolic di-caffeoylquinic acid (Di-CQA), flavonoid cyanidin-3,5-diglucoside (Cy3,5DiG), aromatic isothiocyanate sinalbin (SNB) and aliphatic isothiocyanate sulforaphane (SFN)) sourced from vegetables and fruits underwent assessment for their potential anti-inflammatory activity. An in vitro model of human macrophage-like cells treated with a low dose of LPS to obtain a low degree of inflammation that emulates a chronic inflammation scenario revealed promising results. Cell viability and production of the key pro-inflammatory cytokines were assessed in the presence of various phytochemicals. The compounds Di-CQA and Cy-3,5-DiG, within low physiologically relevant doses, demonstrated notable anti-inflammatory effects by significantly reducing the production of key pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 without affecting cell viability. These findings underscore the potential of plant-derived bioactive compounds as valuable contributors to the prevention or treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. These results suggest that these compounds, whether used individually or as part of natural mixtures, hold promise for their inclusion in nutritional interventions designed to mitigate inflammation in associated pathologies.",

      "abstract": "Cancer remains to be a pervasive disease as traditional treatments have plateaued in efficacy. Anticancer research continues to grow in an effort to find novel preventive and treatment measures for cancers. The papaya plant produces several biologically active phytochemicals, which exhibit anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and anti-oxidative properties. This review explores studies examining these phytochemicals derived from the papaya plant as a potential chemopreventive agent and a cancer therapeutic. Further studies must be done to establish the papaya plant and its phytochemicals as an alternative to traditional cancer treatments."

      "abstract": "The current study explores the effects of microwave treatment at varying wattage and durations on the phytoconstituents, antioxidant status, anti-nutritional factors (ANFs), and metabolite profiles of de-oiled rice bran. The total phenolics and flavonoids showed both increases and decreases depending on specific microwave parameters, while flavonol content consistently increased across all treated groups compared to the control. The DPPH and ABTS free radical scavenging activity, total antioxidant capacity, FRAP, CUPRAC, metal chelating activity, and ascorbic acid content were enhanced in most of the microwaved samples; however, longer microwave exposure at higher wattage led to their reduction. A treatment-specific decrease in ANFs, including condensed tannins, oxalates, and phytates, was observed. HRMS-based untargeted metabolomics identified a diverse range of primary and secondary metabolites, which clustered in a group-specific manner, indicating notable group-wise metabolite variations. Analysis of discriminating metabolites revealed no significant differences in the overall levels of phenolics, flavonoids, vitamins and cofactors, sugars, amino acids, terpenoids, fatty acids, and their derivatives among the treated groups compared to the control; however, several individual metabolites within these metabolite classes differed significantly. These findings suggest that optimized microwaving of de-oiled rice bran can enhance phytochemicals and antioxidants while improving the metabolite profile.",

Although small-molecule inhibitors have been designed to target MET, the development of drug resistance remains a significant challenge to advancing therapeutic strategies. In this study, we employed virtual screening of plant-based compounds sourced from the IMPPAT 2.0 databank to identify potent inhibitors of MET. Preliminary filtering based on the physicochemical parameters following Lipinski's rule of five and pan-assay interference compounds criteria were applied to prioritize hits. Subsequent molecular docking, pharmacokinetic evaluation, prediction of activity spectra for biologically active substances, and specificity assessments facilitated the identification of two promising phytochemicals, neogitogenin and samogenin. Both phytochemicals exhibited considerable drug-like properties with notable binding affinity and selectivity toward MET. Molecular dynamics simulation studies showed the conformational stability of MET with neogitogenin and samogenin. Taken together, these findings suggest that neogitogenin and samogenin hold potential as lead molecules for the development of MET-targeted therapeutics. We call for further evaluations of these phytochemicals in preclinical and experimental studies for anticancer drug discovery and development.",

      "abstract": "Medicinal plants and phytochemicals are some of the major sources in the treatment of various neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is no FDA-approved drug to target AD pathology directly. Full cognitive restoration and management of psychosis-like symptoms are still to be achieved. Being comparatively safer with fewer side effects, medicinal plants have been among the major areas of interest to be researched. Several mechanistic pathways are involved in AD including anticholinesterase activity, glutamate toxicity, free radicals generation, Amyloid β (Aβ) toxicity, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Various phytochemicals such as paenol, andrographolide, isoquercitrin, flavonoids, and saponins obtained from different plant sources, various medicinal plants like Spirulina maxima, Salicornia europaea, Curcuma longa, Citrus Junos Tanaka, Cassiae semen, Centella asiatica as well as various traditional medicinal plants of China, Asia, Europe, Turkey, and Iran have been found effective against one or more of these targets. Large numbers of clinical trials are under process to evaluate the role of different phytoconstituents in AD management. Out of 143 agents under clinical trials, 119 have been categorized as disease-modifying agents. The present review extensively covers the recent advancements in the usage of phytochemicals and medicinal plants in various experimental AD models. It involves clinical trials and other research works divided into three sections, including those performed in vitro, in vivo, and in humans mainly from the last five years along with disease markers and mechanistic pathways involved. However, phytochemicals should be explored further in order to achieve neurorestoration in AD."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to treat 2 similar groups of patients suffering from BPH: one group with a complex based on phycocyanin, PEA and selenium; the other group with dutasteride. So the effectiveness of these treatments was checked, especially regarding the improvement of LUTS and the reduction of PSA and prostate volume. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 104 patients in the study. All patients aged between 50 and 70 years, PSA values between 4 and 10 ng/ml, prostate volume calculated by transrectal ultrasound between 50 and 70 cc, flowmetry with maximum flow value greater than or equal to 10 ml/s, no suspicious nodules on DRE, no suspicious lesions on MRI (PI-RADS 1-2), negative previous prostatic biopsies or never bioptied, moreover absence of diabetes mellitus or chronic renal failure (blood creatinine >2 mg/dl). We considered: -Group A of 54 men who used the complex; -Group B of 50 patients treated with dutasteride. Then we controlled all patients 6 months after starting therapy, considering the following parameters: PSA, prostate volume, flowmetry. RESULTS: Our results showed that both dutasteride and complex decreased PSA levels (both had a p<0.0001), with a more significant contribution of dutasteride (mean decrease of -2.743 ng/ml vs -0.971 ng/ml). Uroflowmetry also improved with both ( p<0.0001) with a mean increase in maximum flow of urine of + 3.03 ml/min for the former and + 13.02 ml/min for the latter. Lastly, dutasteride proved to be highly effective on reducing the prostate volume on TRUS (- 22.14 ml, p<0.0001) compared to Ficoxpea, which showed a mean decrease of - 10.04 ml (p<0.0001). Moreover the consistent reduction in prostate volume obtained through the use of dutasteride proved to be more intense than the one obtained by using the complex even in statistical analysis (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Both Ficoxpea and Dutasteride showed reduction of PSA values after 6 months of treatment. The complex based on phycocyanin, PEA and selenium showed a statistically significant improvement in urinary flow, while dutasteride acts more on the volume of the prostate. However, the natural complex is a product with good efficacy on the phlogistic component and does not have the side effects of dutasteride (e.g. gynecomastia, reduced libido). Therefore, we believe it can be used by a large part of the population, in order to reduce LUTS and PSA and improve urinary flow, without side effects.",

      "abstract": "Haloxylon salicornicum is traditionally used for the treatment of several disorders associated with inflammation. Despite it is a defense response against tissue injury and infections, inflammation can become a chronic condition that can negatively impact the body. This study investigated the effect of H. salicornicum phytochemicals nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cytokines release by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged macrophages in vitro. The binding affinity of the tested phytochemical towards NF-κB and iNOS was investigated using molecular docking. Ten compounds (four coumarins, three sterols and three flavonoids) were isolated from the ethanolic extract of H. salicornicum. Treatment of LPS-challenged macrophages with the compounds resulted in remarkable decrease in NF-κB p65 and iNOS mRNA abundance. All compounds suppressed the production of nitric oxide (NO) and the pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6) from macrophages challenged with LPS. Molecular docking revealed the ability of the isolated phytochemicals to bind NF-κB p65 and iNOS. In conclusion, H. salicornicum is a rich source of phytochemicals with anti-inflammatory properties. The anti-inflammatory efficacy of H. salicornicum phytoconstituents is mediated via their ability to modulate NF-κB and iNOS, and suppress the release of NO, TNF-α, and IL-6 from macrophages.",
