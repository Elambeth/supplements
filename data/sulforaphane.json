      "abstract": "Glucoraphanin (GRA) and sulforaphane (SF) are potent anticancer compounds. Understanding their accumulation mechanisms is crucial for increasing their levels in broccoli. This study aimed to investigate the role of nitric oxide (NO) in GRA and SF accumulation and identify key genes involved in this process. Low NO concentrations were found to promote GRA and SF accumulation. Transcriptome sequencing and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) identified BoNIA2b, a nitrate reductase (NR) gene, as a key regulator of NO-mediated GRA and SF accumulation. Silencing BoNIA2b reduced endogenous NO levels and NR activity in hairy roots, while exogenous treatment with sodium nitroprusside (SNP) restored NO levels without affecting NR activity. Overexpression of BoNIA2b increased NO content and NR activity. Silencing BoNIA2b decreased GRA content, but SF levels remained unaffected. SNP treatment enhanced both GRA and SF accumulation, with GRA being more dependent on BoNIA2b. In BoNIA2b-overexpressing roots, both GRA and SF levels were significantly higher than in controls. Moreover, the interaction between BoNIA2b and BoMYB28 protein was confirmed through Y2H and luciferase complementation assays. These findings underscore BoNIA2b's role in NO-mediated regulation of GRA and SF accumulation in broccoli hairy roots, offering insights to enhancing the production of these anticancer compounds."

      "abstract": "Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a mycotoxin ubiquitously present in the environment. Emerging evidence demonstrated that sulforaphane (SFN) exerts potent protective effects against DON-triggered cytotoxicity through multimodal mechanisms. This study aimed to investigate the protective mechanism of SFN during DON exposure. Untargeted metabolomics of IPEC-J2 cells revealed a total of 399 differential metabolites between the DON and control group and 365 differential metabolites between the SFN + DON and DON group. KEGG enrichment was performed to investigate the potential regulatory pathways. The transcriptome identified a total of 1839 differential expression genes (DEGs) between DON and SFN + DON groups. This result indicated that DON exposure and SFN treatment have a profound impact on cellular metabolism and genes. Integrated analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome showed that spermine was a potential biomarker for SFN treatment. SFN increased spermine abundance by regulating genes in glutathione, beta-alanine, and arginine and proline metabolism pathways. Functional experiments demonstrated that spermine alleviated DON-induced oxidative stress, as evidenced by increased cell viability, reduced ROS levels, restored mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and normalized antioxidant enzyme activity. Moreover, spermine significantly decreased the cell apoptosis rate induced by DON, which suggested that spermine significantly alleviated the DON-induced cytotoxicity. Overall, these findings elucidated the protective role of SFN through spermine-related mechanisms against the toxicity of DON.",

      "abstract": "In diabetes, chronic hyperglycaemia leads to cognitive impairment, neurodegeneration and dementia. In a rodent model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetes (STZ-T1D), we previously demonstrated that recurrent hypoglycaemia (RH) further exacerbates this process through a mechanism involving increased oxidative and inflammatory stress that overwhelms the compensatory activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) antioxidant system, which was insufficient to prevent cognitive impairment. The current study investigated whether the induction of the antioxidant response through pre-treatment with sulforaphane (SFN), a potent Nrf2 inducer, would ameliorate these cognitive deficits. A mouse model of chronic insulin-treated T1D was achieved using STZ (125 mg/kg i.p.) and insulin implants (Linbit®). Diabetic and Control (C57BL6/J) mice were randomly allocated to one of the following seven groups: (i) Control, (ii) STZ-T1D, (iii) Control + RH, (iv) STZ-T1D + RH, (v) Control + RH + SFN, (vi) STZ-T1D + RH + SFN or (vii) STZ-T1D + SFN, and subjected to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia (three episodes per week for four weeks). SFN (50 mg/kg i.p.) or a vehicle (0.1% DMSO/PBS i.p.) were administered 24 h before each hypoglycaemic episode. Cognition was assessed with the Novel Object Recognition (NOR) and spontaneous alternation (SA) tasks. SFN significantly improved the cognitive performance in the 24-h NOR and SA tasks in the STZ-T1D + RH groups. These improvements were absent in the Control or Nrf2-null mice receiving SFN. These studies show, for the first time, that the pharmacological activation of the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway may provide a novel therapeutic target for treating cognitive impairment associated with RH in T1D."

      "abstract": "Obstructive nephropathy (ON), characterized by urine flow disruption, can induce chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although the release of the obstruction is performed as the primary intervention, renal pathology often persists and progresses. Accordingly, the murine model of releasing unilateral ureteral obstruction (RUUO) is valuable for investigating the molecular events underlying renal damage after obstruction release. Remarkably, after RUUO, disturbances such as oxidative stress, inflammation, lipid accumulation, and fibrosis continue to increase. Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to fibrosis in the UUO model, but its role in RUUO remains unclear. Additionally, the impact of using antioxidants to restore mitochondrial function and prevent renal fibrosis in RUUO has not been determined. This study aimed to determine the therapeutic effect of pre-administering the antioxidant sulforaphane (SFN) in the RUUO model. SFN was administered 1 day before RUUO to evaluate mitochondrial biogenesis, fatty acids (FA) metabolism, bioenergetics, dynamics, and mitophagy/autophagy mechanisms in the kidney. Our data demonstrated that SFN enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and reestablished mitochondrial oxygen consumption and β-oxidation. These effects collectively reduced lipid accumulation and normalized mitochondrial dynamics, mitophagy, and autophagy, thereby mitigating fibrosis after obstruction. Our findings suggest that SFN holds promise as a potential therapeutic agent in ON-induced CKD progression in RUUO and opens new avenues in studying antioxidant molecules to treat this disease."

      "abstract": "Chronic prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) are diagnosed in patients with various pelvic or genitourinary symptoms irrespective of the presence of a tender prostate. The etiology of chronic nonbacterial prostatitis remains unclear. Current treatments such as alpha-blockers, neuroleptics, anti-inflammatory，medications, and physical therapy, are often unsatisfactory. New treatments, as well as an improved knowledge of the underlying CP/CPPS pathogenesis, are thus needed. Sulforaphane (SFN), an isothiocyanate found in large quantities in Brassica species, has shown therapeutic effects on inflammation and cancer, and can protect against DNA damage and modulate the cell cycle to control apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis. At the molecular level, SFN modulates cell homeostasis by activating the transcription factor Nrf2. However, its effect on CP/CPPS is not clear. Here, SFN was found to alleviate inflammation by suppressing NLRP3 inflammasomes via the Nrf2/HO-1 axis, as demonstrated in both animal and cellular analyses."

      "abstract": "Salinity stress severely impacts agricultural productivity by inhibiting seed germination in rice. Finding plant-derived products that can improve germination under salinity stress offers an environment-friendly approach. This study investigates the protective role of exogenous sulforaphane (SFN) in enhancing rice seed germination under salinity stress. We compared the responses of salt-sensitive (LLY-7108) and salt-tolerant (G-16) rice varieties to determine the effectiveness of SFN treatment with 150 mM NaCl stress, where LLY-7108 showed significantly higher germination inhibition under salt stress compared to G-16, while SFN application notably improved germination rate of LLY-7108 with minimal effects on G-16. Our investigation revealed that salt stress increased Na+ accumulation and Na+/K+ ratio in rice seeds, leading to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (H2O2, O2-) and malonaldehyde (MDA). This ionic imbalance disrupted hormone homeostasis, decreasing gibberellic acid (GA) while increasing abscisic acid (ABA) levels, and inhibited α-amylase activity, thereby reducing starch hydrolysis. SFN treatment effectively mitigated these adverse effects by enhancing OsHKT1;1 and OsHKT1;5 expressions, which reduced Na+ uptake and improved ion balance. Additionally, SFN enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT), regulated ABA biosynthesis genes (OsNCED1, OsNCED3), improved α-amylase activity, and increased soluble sugar content; besides it improved the cell ultrastructure and chloroplast structure versus salt treatment. These findings highlight SFN's protective role in rice germination under salinity stress through ion homeostasis regulation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, hormone balance restoration, and enhanced starch metabolism. SFN offers a practical solution for improving direct-seeded rice germination in saline soils."

      "abstract": "TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) was implicated to be a brand-new target for sulforaphane (SFN) in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), while the mechanism was elusive. We found that highly expressed TIGAR was positively correlated to pathological grading and contributed to poor survival in NSCLC patients. Western blot showed that SFN downregulated α-tubulin, TIGAR, Timm23 and Timm17A in cytosolic and/or mitochondrial lysate. Besides, SFN downregulated α-tubulin contributing to TIGAR reduction, and also decreased interactions of α-tubulin to Timm23, Timm17A and TIGAR in mitochondria; thus, SFN disrupted the microtubule-mediated mitochondrial transmembrane complexes blocking the entry of cytosolic TIGAR into mitochondria. Further, SFN downregulated mitoprotease LONP1 and decreased the binding of LONP1 to TIGAR; knockdown of LONP1 activated mitochondrial caspase-3 causing the cleavage of mitochondrial TIGAR; SFN-mediated the reduction of TIGAR decreased NADPH leading to ROS elevation and apoptosis in NSCLC. These studies will provide key targets for anti-NSCLC therapy.",

      "abstract": "In the current period of pharmaceutical discovery, herbal remedies have shown to be an unmatched supply of anticancer medications. By changing the tumor microenvironment and several signaling pathways, plants and their byproducts through analogs have an important part in the therapy for carcinoma. The current investigation assessed the effectiveness of inhibiting the development of gastric cancer cells in HGC-27 cells by attenuating the PI3K/AKT and ERK 1/2 MAPK signaling pathways using the natural medicines silibinin (SIL) and sulforaphane (SFN) complemented by molecular docking analysis. After being exposed to various doses of SIL and SFN (SIL+SFN) for 24 h (0-50 µM), the cells were evaluated for multiple studies. The MTT assay was used to examine the combo that SIL+SFN induced cytotoxicity. ROS was assessed by DCFH-DA staining. Apoptotic changes were investigated, and MMP levels in HGC-27 cells were investigated utilizing the proper fluorescent staining techniques. Flow cytometry and western blot analysis were used to evaluate the protein profiles of cell survival, cell cycle, proliferation, and apoptosis. The molecular docking was conducted with Autodock Vina (v1.5.6). The docking results were analyzed using BIOVIA Discovery Studio Visualizer to identify key interactions. The relative cytotoxicity of SIL and SFN was found to be approximately 24.96 and 28.79 μM, correspondingly, according to the findings. After a 24-h incubation period, the combination of SIL and SFN generates significant cytotoxicity in HGC-27 cells, with an IC50 of 15.43 μM. Furthermore, HGC-27 cells administered SIL and SFN simultaneously exhibited elevated apoptotic signals and significant ROS production. Molecular docking demonstrated strong binding affinities between the compounds and the target proteins, supporting their potential mechanisms of action. Therefore, the combination usage of SIL + SFN has been viewed as a chemotherapeutic drug since it prevents the synthesis of PI3K/AKT and ERK 1/2 MAPK mediated control of cell growth and cell cycle-regulating proteins. To utilize them commercially conducting more in vivo research in the near future will be necessary to ascertain how well the co-treatment triggers apoptosis.",

The present study investigated the in vitro anticancer activity of sulforaphane (SFN), an isothiocyanate derived from Brassica oleracea, on the OECM-1 human oral squamous carcinoma cell line. Methods: OECM-1 cells were cultured and exposed to a range of SFN concentrations. To assess the cell viability and determine the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of SFN following 24 h of treatment, an MTT assay was performed. Apoptosis was evaluated using AO/PI staining, a TUNEL assay, Annexin V-FITC analysis, and a DNA fragmentation assay. Changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential were analyzed using a JC-1 staining assay. A Western blot assay was performed to assess the expression levels of apoptosis-associated proteins (Bax, Bcl2, caspase-3, caspase-9, PARP, Smad-4, p53, cytochrome c, and GAPDH). Cell cycle analysis was performed to validate the apoptotic findings. Results: The IC50 concentration of SFN was 5.7 µM. The apoptotic assays demonstrated an effective induction of apoptosis in the OECM-1 cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated the dose-dependent upregulation of p53, caspase-3, caspase-9, PARP, cytochrome c, and Bax and the downregulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Smad-4 after SFN treatment. Conclusions: The data obtained indicate that SFN has significant potential to induce apoptosis in OECM-1 cells by disrupting mitochondrial function and modulating apoptotic pathways. The outcomes of our research indicate SFN's potential as a viable treatment drug for OSCC."

Sulforaphane is an organosulfur compound with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This study aimed to evaluate its efficacy in ameliorating negative symptoms and cognitive impairments in chronic schizophrenia patients. METHOD: This 24-week double-blind randomised trial (NCT04521868) recruited schizophrenia patients with significant negative symptoms. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either sulforaphane or placebo and were required to complete at least one post-intervention assessment to evaluate changes in negative symptoms and cognitive functioning. Existing antipsychotic medication treatment regimens remained unchanged throughout the study. RESULTS: A total of 42 patients were included in the statistical analysis, with 28 receiving sulforaphane and 14 assigned to placebo. Sulforaphane significantly reduced the Negative Symptom Score from the PANSS 5-Factor model between groups (p = 0.007) and exhibited a significant time-by-group interaction (p = 0.023), with more pronounced group differences observed after 12 weeks compared to 24 weeks of treatment. Sulforaphane also demonstrated a significant reduction in the original PANSS Negative Symptom Score between groups (p = 0.029). However, sulforaphane showed no significant effects on the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery composite score or its subscores. CONCLUSION: The significant improvements in the Negative Symptom Score from the PANSS 5-Factor model and the original PANSS Negative Symptom Score in the sulforaphane group suggest the potential of sulforaphane as an adjunctive treatment for ameliorating negative symptoms in chronic schizophrenia. Further research is warranted to explore the effects of sulforaphane on cognitive function.",

Thirty-seven participants (17 in the sulforaphane and 20 in the placebo group) completed the study. Supplementation of sulforaphane did not show significant impact on bronchial histopathology, but significantly reduced Ki-67 index with a 20% decrease in the sulforaphane group and a 65% increase in the placebo (p = 0.014). The difference was even greater in high-density (3+) positive Ki-67, with a 44% decrease in the sulforaphane group compared with a 71% increase in the placebo (p = 0.004). Higher bioavailability of sulforaphane was correlated with greater reduction of Ki-67 index (P for trend = 0.019). Sulforaphane treatment had no impact on Caspase-3 or TUNEL index in bronchial biopsies. No severe adverse event was observed in the study participants. The findings of oral sulforaphane that significantly reduced Ki-67 index in bronchial tissue support further development as a potential chemopreventive agent against lung cancer development."

We optimized an endogenous extraction protocol for high SFN content, characterized by HPLC and LC-MS analyses. SFN remained stable in refrigerated broccoli sprout extract powder (BSEP) for over a month. BSEP showed four times higher oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) than the SFN standard, indicating high antioxidant capacity. It also reduced inflammatory responses by down-regulating COX-2, IL-6, and TNF-α gene expression in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages. Additionally, BSEP exhibited neuroprotective properties in amyloid-beta (1-42) (Aβ1-42)-induced Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice, enhancing memory and learning retention in water maze and passive avoidance tests. BSEP mitigated spatial cognitive impairment and improved memory function in Aβ1-42-induced memory-deficient mice. While BSEP did not alter acetylcholine (ACh) concentration, it improved memory and learning by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. BSEP with SFN content exceeding 200 mg/kg ameliorated neurobehavioral deficits and protected the brain from amyloid deposition, suggesting its therapeutic potential in AD treatment. We propose an eco-friendly form of SFN-rich BSEP for daily intake and commercial therapeutics."

      "abstract": "Breast cancer is a debilitating chronic condition that affects millions and causes the death of hundreds of thousands of people annually worldwide. Sulforaphane (SFN) has the potential to prevent and enhance the management of breast cancer and alleviate its poor outcomes. As most of the available evidence on SFN's impact and safety in breast cancer management is from cell culture studies and animal models, there is a need to consolidate this evidence to determine whether there is a need to conduct empirical human studies. This systematic review summarizes and analyzes evidence of SFN's impact on breast cancer progression and radiation therapy outcomes in terms of efficacy and safety. A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed, Cumulated Index in Nursing and Allied Health Literature, ProQuest Central, and ScienceDirect databases to find sources of evidence. The selected sources were published between 2018 and 2024. The inclusion and exclusion criteria included studies published in the last eight years, availability in full-text, published in English, and covering concepts relevant to the topic. The selected sources were summarized through literature review tables and the evidence was synthesized to identify themes relevant to the impact of SFN in breast cancer progression and radiation therapy outcomes. In total, 20 sources of evidence, including three randomized controlled trials, five in vivo animal models, and 12 cell culture studies, were selected for review and analysis. The sources were broadly classified into two themes, namely, the role of SFN in breast cancer biology and the safety of SFN in radiation therapy. The evidence confirmed that SFN targets breast cancer biology by modulating reactive oxygen species and reducing the proliferation of tumors, inducing apoptosis, and inhibiting metastasis. SFN is an effective and safer treatment as it reduces damage to and protects normal cells, causes a synergistic effect rather than interacting with other breast cancer cells, and is effective in concentrations ranging from 5 µM to 200 µM. Cell culture studies and animal models have proven that SFN is highly effective in breast cancer prevention and treatment either as a single intervention or in combination with radiotherapy and chemotherapy."

Sulforaphane (SFN) is a naturally occurring isothiocyanate that indirectly activates the transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2), thus inducing the expression of Nrf2 target genes, including antioxidant enzymes. This study aimed to identify the effects of a single dose of SFN administration on exhaustive exercise-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in skeletal muscle tissue and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Thirty-six mice were divided into four groups: control, SFN, exercise (Ex), and SFN + Ex. The SFN group and SFN + Ex group received SFN orally (50 mg/kg body weight) 2 h before the running test. Exercise significantly reduced plasma glucose levels, while the SFN-treated group exhibited a smaller reduction. Acute exhaustive exercise increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in muscle tissue, while the SFN + Ex group exhibited significantly reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The gene expression of Nrf2 and its target enzymes, including heme oxygenase (HO)-1, superoxide dismutase (SOD)-1, catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)-1, was measured in the gastrocnemius and soleus muscle tissue. Compared with the Ex group, the SFN + Ex group showed upregulated expression of all these parameters, including Nrf2. SFN treatment reduced acute exhaustive exercise-induced oxidative stress and inflammation via activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway."

It has been reported to possess antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-cancer and autophagy regulating properties. Recent studies have revealed that SFN regulates fat metabolism both in vivo and in vitro through various mechanisms, including alleviating endoplasmic reticulum stress, inhibiting inflammatory response and improving mitochondrial dysfunction, involving Nrf2/ARE, NF-κB, NLRP3 inflammasome, HDAC8-PGC1α axis and other signaling pathways. By curbing complications associated with abnormal fat metabolic diseases, SFN exhibits therapeutic effects on conditions like obesity, fatty liver disease, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, etc., with minimal side effects. Therefore, it holds promise as a potential alternative treatment for lipid metabolism-related diseases. Although its extraction method has been matured, the thermal instability and preservation difficulties of SFN limit its clinical promotion. More effective and low-cost methods to improve the stability and production of SFN remain to be further studied. This paper reviews the physiological and biological activities of SFN, and summarizes the protective effects and molecular mechanisms of SFN in diseases related to abnormal lipid metabolism. Additionally, it proposes potential challenges, possible solutions and future research directions in the clinical application of SFN.",

      "abstract": "Sulforaphane (SFN), a natural compound found in cruciferous vegetables, possesses well-documented antitumor properties. However, the precise functions and mechanisms of SFN in cancer suppression remain poorly understood. Here we provide evidence to demonstrate that SFN exerts more pronounced antitumor effects in immunocompetent mice compared to immunodeficient mice, suggesting the involvement of the host immune system in SFN-mediated tumor suppression. Furthermore, we reveal that SFN primarily acts through CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to enhance antitumor immunity by blocking the IFN-γ-mediated induction of PD-L1, a critical immune checkpoint receptor expressed in cancer cells. Importantly, our findings indicate that the suppression of PD-L1 expression by SFN is independent of the NRF2 protein stabilization pathway. Instead, SFN inhibits IFN-γ-mediated activation of STAT1, a key transcription factor involved in PD-L1 induction. Mechanistically, SFN covalently modifies specific cysteine residues (C155 and C174) on STAT1, resulting in the inhibition of its transcriptional activity. Notably, SFN-mediated downregulation of PD-L1 contributes to its antitumor immune effects, as demonstrated by enhanced anti-CTLA-4-mediated cytotoxicity. These findings indicate that SFN's antitumor effect extends beyond its direct cytotoxic properties, as it also actively engages the host immune system. This underscores SFN's immense potential as an immune-modulating agent in cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "Considering the limitations of monotherapies due to chemoresistance and side effects, this research aimed to determine whether low doses of sulforaphane (SFN) combined with docetaxel (DCT) could enhance therapeutic efficacy. Prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC-3 were treated with individual IC50 doses of SFN and DCT and half-reduced IC50 values for the SFN:DCT combination. Metabolic markers, including glucose consumption, lactate production, reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial mass, and caspase activity, were assessed. In LNCaP cells, the SFN:DCT combination reduced cell viability to 50%, comparable to DCT monotherapy (48%). Caspase 3 activation was also higher with SFN:DCT (2.4 ± 0.75 RFU) than DCT alone (2.1 ± 0.47 RFU), while caspase 8 activation remained comparable, indicating equivalent effectiveness at lower concentrations. In PC-3 cells, the combination induced caspase 3 activation (1.16 ± 0.0484 RFU) at levels slightly lower than DCT (1.51 ± 0.2062 RFU) but achieved greater reductions in mitochondrial mass, reflecting its ability to target metabolic vulnerabilities in aggressive phenotypes. Our findings suggest that the SFN:DCT combination is a promising strategy for early-stage prostate cancer. By achieving comparable efficacy to DCT monotherapy at low doses, the SFN:DCT combination maintains the therapeutic impact, mitigating the adverse effects of conventional DCT treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Delayed wound healing frequently occurs as a complication of diabetes. Diabetic wounds that are difficult to heal are associated with chronic, persistent inflammation, characterized by impaired efferocytosis and a sustained pro-inflammatory state of macrophages at the wound site. Sulforaphane (SFN), a bioactive compound found in cruciferous vegetables, possesses anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Numerous studies have shown that SFN can inhibit various inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis and psoriasis; however, its potential in treating diabetic wounds remains unknown. PURPOSE: This study investigates the effects and potential mechanisms of SFN on diabetic wound healing. METHODS: Network pharmacology approaches were employed to identify potential targets of SFN for diabetic wound treatment. Additionally, an STZ-induced diabetic mouse model (C57/B6) was used in in vivo studies to examine SFN's impact on diabetic wound healing. Simultaneously, immunofluorescence staining, immunohistochemical staining, Western blotting, and qPCR analysis were employed to detect phenotypes associated with macrophage efferocytosis and M2 polarization. Subsequently, the mechanism underlying SFN treatment was explored through in vitro experiments utilizing the THP-1 human monocyte cell line. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that topical SFN application accelerated wound healing in diabetic mice, partly through the enhancement of impaired macrophage efferocytosis and the promotion of M2 macrophage polarization, thereby reducing the inflammatory response at the wound site. SFN promoted the phagocytosis of apoptotic Jurkat cells by THP-1 differentiated macrophages, reducing the resulting inflammatory response. Mechanistic studies revealed that SFN promotes macrophage efferocytosis by activating nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), leading to upregulation of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) expression and subsequent enhancement of mer proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MERTK), a recognition receptor for efferocytosis. Furthermore, SFN enhanced macrophage polarization toward the M2 phenotype and reduced the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response in vitro. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that SFN could serve as an effective adjunct or novel therapeutic agent for treating chronic non-healing wounds in diabetes.",

It acquires several benefits to health in addition to its considered antibacterial and antivirulence activities. Herein, we aimed at evaluating the antivirulence activity of sulforaphane against the worldwide clinically important enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. The influence of sulforaphane on bacterial adhesion, invasion, biofilm formation, and intracellular replication was assayed. Additionally, the effect of sulforaphane on the type III secretion system (TTSS) in S. enterica was quantified. The outcome of the combination with different antibiotics was assessed, and an in vivo protection assay was conducted to assess the influence on S. enterica pathogenesis. The results showed the significant antibiofilm activity of sulforaphane at subinhibitory effect in addition to its significant reduction in bacterial invasion and intracellular replication inside the host cells. The in vivo findings emphasized the decreased capacity of S. enterica to induce pathogenesis in the presence of sulforaphane. Our finding attributed these antivirulence activities to the interference of sulforaphane with TTSS-type II and the downregulation of its encoding genes. In a nutshell, the edible cruciferous vegetable bioactive sulforaphane is a safe adjunct therapy that can be administrated alongside traditional antibiotics for treating clinically significant enteric pathogens as S. enterica."

SFN ameliorates various disease models in rodents (e.g., cancer, diabetes, seizures) that are likewise mitigated by dietary restrictions leading us to test the hypothesis that this compound elicits cellular responses consistent with being a fasting/caloric restriction mimetic. Using immortalized human retinal pigment epithelial cells, we report that SFN impacted multiple nutrient-sensing pathways consistent with a fasted state. SFN treatment (i) increased mitochondrial mass and resistance to oxidative stress, (ii) acutely suppressed markers of mTORC1/2 activity via inhibition of insulin signaling, (iii) upregulated autophagy and further amplified autophagic flux induced by rapamycin or nutrient deprivation while concomitantly promoting lysosomal biogenesis, and (iv) acutely decreased glucose uptake and lactate secretion followed by an adaptive rebound that coincided with suppressed protein levels of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) due to early transcriptional down-regulation. This early suppression of TXNIP mRNA expression could be overcome with exogenous glucosamine consistent with SFN inhibiting glutamine F6P amidotransferase, the rate limiting enzyme of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. SFN also altered levels of multiple glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates while reducing the inhibitory phosphorylation on pyruvate dehydrogenase, indicative of an adaptive cellular starvation response directing pyruvate into acetyl coenzyme A for uptake by the TCA cycle. RNA-seq of cells treated for 4 h with SFN confirmed the activation of signature starvation-responsive transcriptional programs. Collectively, these data support that the fasting-mimetic properties of SFN could underlie both the therapeutic efficacy and potential toxicity of this phytochemical."

To conquer these issues, we take advantage of the high penetrating ability of sonodynamic therapy (SDT), combined with a novel nanocomplex that can easily pass the BBB. Methods: Through ultrasonic polymerization, the amphiphilic peptides (C18GR7RGDS) were self-assembled as a spherical shell encapsulating a sonosensitizer Rose Bengal (RB) and a plant-derived compound, sulforaphane (SFN), to form the nanocomplex SFN@RB@SPM. Results/Conclusions: SFN@RB@SPM can be internalized by the glioma cells through the tumor-targeting motif RGDS (abbreviated for the peptide sequence composed of arginine, glycine, aspartic acid, and serine), and further executes antitumor function during SDT. Also, SFN@RB@SPM could be easily taken up by U87-MG cells and cross the BBB in glioma-bearing mice during SDT. The mechanism investigation revealed that, compared with the SFN-free nanocomplex (RB@SPM), SFN@RB@SPM induced much more apoptosis of U87-MG cells in an ROS-dependent manner through the depletion of glutathione by SFN and the cavitation effect by SDT. In animal experiments, besides a significant reduction in tumor volume and a delay in losing body weight, H&E staining showed a massive infiltration of neutrophils adjacent to the tumor sites, indicating this novel nanocomplex SFN@RB@SPM can synergistically augment SDT efficacy, partially by enhancing the antitumor function of innate immunity."

      "abstract": "Objective: There are few established treatments for negative symptoms in schizophrenia, which persist in many patients after positive symptoms are reduced. Oxidative stress, inflammation, and epigenetic modifications involving histone deacetylase (HDAC) have been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Sulforaphane has antioxidant properties and is an HDAC inhibitor. We conducted a 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, in Hunan, China, to assess the effect of high-dose sulforaphane (Nutramax extra strength sulforaphane tablets glucoraphanin content 30 mg/ tablet) on reducing negative symptoms in antipsychotic-treated patients with schizophrenia. Methods: Participants were recruited from August 2020 to August 2022 and met DSM-5 criteria for schizophrenia. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive antipsychotics plus sulforaphane (1,700 mg Avmacol Extra Strength sulforaphane daily) or antipsychotics plus placebo for 24 weeks. Fifty-three patients treated with sulforaphane and 24 patients treated with placebo who had at least 1 postintervention clinical scale evaluation were analyzed. The primary outcome measure was change in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) negative symptoms. Results: Sulforaphane-treated patients showed a significantly greater decrease in PANSS negative symptom total score (P = .01) and PANSS negative factor score (P = .02) than placebo-treated patients, with the most prominent difference occurring at 24 weeks (P ≤ .001) with a large effect size at this time point (d = 0.8). Sulforaphane's effect on decreasing negative symptoms was not mediated by changes in scores of depression or cognitive factors on the PANSS. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that add-on high-dose sulforaphane may reduce negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. The clinical significance of this reduction in negative symptoms needs further evaluation. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04521868.",

      "abstract": "Dental caries has been one of the most prevalent diseases globally over the last few decades, threatening human oral and general health. The most critical aspect in caries control is to inhibit the dominant cariogenic bacteria Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans). Sulforaphane (SFN), a compound found in a wide range of cruciferous plants, has demonstrated bacteriostatic activities against various pathogenic bacteria. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of SFN on S. mutans though both in vitro and in vivo experiment. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against S. mutans was determined at 256 μg/mL. The growth of S. mutans and the biofilm formation were inhibited by SFN in a dose-dependent manner through suppressing the synthesis of extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) and acid production, as well as decreasing the acid tolerance. Meanwhile, SFN significantly weakened the cariogenic properties of S. mutans at sub-inhibitory concentrations, which were further illustrated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Moreover, SFN were found to inhibit quorum sensing (QS) by downregulate comCDE system in S. mutans. Further investigation using a rat caries model displayed a prominent caries control in the SFN-treated group with no observed toxicity. The notable results demonstrated in this study highlight the potential of SFN as a natural substitute for current anti-caries agents, while also providing valuable insights into the potential applications of SFN in caries control."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Sulforaphane (SFN), an isothiocyanate in cruciferous plants, has been reported to be effective in treating central nervous system diseases. However, how SFN protects the central nervous system needs further study. The aim of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effect of SFN and its possible mechanism of action. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were used to develop a cognitive impairment model. The Morris water maze (MWM) was used to evaluate the effect of SFN on learning and memory, and haematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and terminal transferase deoxyuridine nick-end labelling (TUNEL) were used to observe morphologic changes in neurons and neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus and cortex. An oxidative stress marker kit was used to detect the content and activity of SFN, and the expressions of nuclear factor drythroid-2 related Factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1) were measured by RT-PCR. RESULTS: SFN treatment significantly improved cognition, increased the number of neurons, and suppressed neuronal apoptosis. In addition, SFN significantly decreased the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and enhanced the antioxidant activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in the hippocampus and cortex. Furthermore, SFN elevated the expression of Nrf-2, HO-1, and NQO-1. CONCLUSIONS: SFN ameliorated diabetes-induced cognitive dysfunction by activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, providing a new perspective for SFN therapy to delay cognitive impairment in diabetes patients."

      "abstract": "Sulforaphane (SF) is a sulfur (S)-containing isothiocyanate found in cruciferous vegetables and is known for its potent anticancer properties. Broccoli sprouts, in particular, are considered safe and healthy dietary choices due to their high SF content and other beneficial biological activities, such as enhanced metabolite ingestion. The application of selenium (Se) is an excellent approach to enhance the abundance of SF. Previous studies have often focused on gene expression and changes in the synthetic substrates of glucoraphanin (RAA) to explain SF variation in response to Se application. However, the regulatory network and other physiological and biochemical reactions involved in the regulation of SF biosynthesis are poorly understood. In this study, Se-treated broccoli sprouts had higher SF and RAA contents; they increased with increasing Se application. Using RNA-seq in combination with KEGG, GO, phenotypic, and WGCNA analyses, it was observed that not only gene expression was induced but also that glutathione serves as an S donor for SF biosynthesis and acts as an oxidative stress reliever as a result of Se treatment. Additionally, a module related to glucosinolate biosynthesis was identified. Yeast one-hybrid system and dual luciferase reporter assay were utilized. These assays demonstrated the hub transcription factors GATA22, ERF12-like, and MYB108 would directly bind to SUR1 promoter and positively regulate its expression. Our study presents the first global overview of the role of GSH metabolism in response to Se for SF biosynthesis, and provides a novel and valuable gene resource for the molecular breeding of high-SF broccoli.",

Both drug-sensitive SKM-1 cells and their drug-resistant SKM/VCR variant, which overexpresses the drug transporter P-glycoprotein, were used. SFN and BITC reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner, with BITC showing greater potency. IC50 values ranged from 7.0-8.0 µM for SFN and 4.0-5.0 µM for BITC in both cell types, with only slight differences between the variants. Both ITCs induced autophagy as evidenced by increased LC3-II production and caused a significant increase in the sub-G0/G1 cell population, especially with BITC. Apoptosis was more pronounced after BITC treatment, whereas SFN had a weaker effect. These results suggest that autophagy may act as a defense mechanism in response to ITC-induced apoptosis in human AML cells.",

An important part of the therapy of cancer is the use of plants and their by-products via analogues, which alter the tumor microenvironment and several signaling pathways. The objective of the current investigation was to conclude the rate at which the herbal medications quercetin (QT) and sulforaphane (SFN) repressed the growth of breast carcinoma cells in MDA-MB-231 by preventing the ERK/MAPK signaling systems. The cells were assessed for several studies after being subjected to different concentrations (0-70 µM) of QT and SFN (QT + SFN) for duration of 24 h. We investigated the combination that QT + SFN generated cytotoxicity using the MTT assay. The DCFH-DA staining technique was utilized to assess ROS. The protein spectra of survival of cells, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis were evaluated employing flow cytometry and western blotting. The consequences illustrated that the relative cytotoxicity of QT and SFN was roughly 28.74 μM and 39.87 μM for MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively. Following the 24-h incubation period, MDA-MB-231 cells exhibit considerable cytotoxicity when QT and SFN are combined, with IC50 values of 19.48 μM. Moreover, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with QT and SFN concurrently showed substantial production of ROS and increased apoptotic signals. Consequently, because QT + SFN inhibit the production of ERK/MAPK/JNK/p38-based control of proliferation and cell cycle-regulating proteins, it has been considered a chemotherapeutic medication. To determine the extent to which the co-treatment induces apoptosis, more in vivo study will be required before they can be used commercially."

      "abstract": "Chemoradiotherapy is a conventional treatment modality for patients with glioblastoma (GBM). However, the efficacy of this approach is significantly hindered by the development of therapeutic resistance. The thioredoxin system, which plays a crucial role in maintaining redox homeostasis, confers protection to cancer cells against apoptosis induced by chemoradiotherapy. Herein, we demonstrate that sulforaphane (SFN), an isothiocyanate phytochemical with anti-cancer effects, inhibits the activity of thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1) through covalent conjugation with residues C59/64/497&U498. This inhibition of TrxR1 leads to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby enhancing chemoradiotherapy-induced apoptosis in GBM cells. Furthermore, SFN-induced ROS accumulation facilitates the polarization of M1-like macrophages, which synergistically sensitize GBM tumors to chemoradiotherapy. In conclusion, our study unveils that SFN has potential benefits in improving the effect of chemoradiotherapy and prognosis for GBM patients by targeting TrxR1."

Although there is no known cure for metabolic syndrome, lifestyle changes in diet and physical activity can help. Sulforaphane (SFN), a compound in cruciferous vegetables, has been recognized as a promising treatment for addressing metabolic syndrome. The information was compiled after a thorough search of four databases, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Sciences, and Google Scholar. This analysis includes 86 studies that include clinical and nonclinical SFN investigations in diseases connected to metabolic syndrome. Research has shown that sulforaphane is a prospective treatment option for obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2-DM), and associated metabolic disorders due to its capacity to regulate fatty acid production and glucose management. Many molecular processes have been investigated, including activating nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Nrf2), activating nuclear factor erythroid 2(NF-E2), reducing reactive oxygen species, and upregulating insulin receptor substrate 1(IRS-1) and other suggested mechanisms. The current review established many facts in favor of SFN's prospective benefits in metabolic syndrome.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the protective effect and possible mechanism of sulforaphane (SFN) on acute liver injury in mice induced by diquat (DQ) poisoning. METHODS: Forty-eight male C57BL/6 mice were divided into Control group, DQ model group (DQ group), SFN intervention group (DQ+SFN group), and SFN control group (SFN group) using a random number table method, with 12 mice in each group. Acute liver injury mice model was established by one-time intraperitoneal injection of 1 mL of 40 mg/kg DQ solution at once. SFN group was injected with 1 mL of ddH2O. After 4 hours of molding, 0.5 mL of 5 mg/kg SFN solution was injected into the peritoneal cavity of the DQ+SFN group and SFN group, once daily for 7 consecutive days. DQ group and Control group were injected with an equal amount of ddH2O. Then, the mice were euthanized to collect liver tissue and blood samples, and the levels of plasma biomarkers alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), as well as oxidative stress indicators such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in liver tissue were measured. The changes of liver structure were observed under transmission electron microscopy. The apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in liver tissue were observed under fluorescence microscope. Western blotting was used to detect the protein expressions of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), and cleaved caspase-9 in liver tissue. RESULTS: Compared with the Control group, the liver mitochondria in the DQ group showed severe swelling, partial dissolution of the matrix, and cristae rupture and loss; the levels of plasma AST and ALT significantly increased, the MDA content in the liver increased, the activities of SOD and GSH decreased, the level of ROS significantly increased, the number of apoptotic cells in the liver significantly increased, the protein expressions of Nrf2 and HO-1 significantly decreased, and the protein expressions of Keap1 and cleaved caspase-9 significantly increased. Compared with the DQ group, the mitochondrial damage in the DQ+SFN group was reduced, the levels of plasma AST and ALT were significantly reduced [ALT (U/L): 58.22±4.39 vs. 79.94±3.32, AST (U/L): 177.64±8.40 vs. 219.62±11.60, both P < 0.01], the liver MDA content decreased, and the activities of SOD and GSH increased [MDA (μmol/g: 5.63±0.18 vs. 5.96±0.29, SOD (kU/g): 102.05±4.01 vs. 84.34±5.34, GSH (mmol/g): 16.32±1.40 vs. 13.12±1.84, all P < 0.05], the production of ROS in liver tissue was significantly reduced [ROS (fluorescence intensity): 115.90±10.89 vs. 190.70±10.16, P < 0.05], and apoptotic cells were significantly reduced (cell apoptosis index: 4.39±1.00 vs. 10.71±0.56, P < 0.01), the protein expressions of Nrf2 and HO-1 were significantly increased, while the protein expressions of Keap1 and cleaved caspase-9 were significantly decreased (Nrf2/β-actin: 1.15±0.04 vs. 0.93±0.05, HO-1/β-actin: 1.75±0.12 vs. 0.78±0.04, Keap1/β-actin: 1.00±0.14 vs. 1.28±0.13, cleaved caspase-9/β-actin: 1.31±0.12 vs. 1.81±0.09, all P < 0.05).

Although exercise has been established as a powerful inducer of quality control processes that ultimately enhance mitochondrial function, there are currently limited pharmaceutical interventions available that emulate exercise-induced mitochondrial adaptations. To investigate a novel candidate for this role, we examined sulforaphane (SFN), a naturally occurring compound found in cruciferous vegetables. SFN has been documented as a potent antioxidant inducer through its activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) antioxidant response pathway. However, its effects on muscle health have been underexplored. To investigate the interplay between chronic exercise and SFN, C2C12 myotubes were electrically stimulated to model chronic contractile activity (CCA) in the presence or absence of SFN. SFN promoted Nrf-2 nuclear translocation, enhanced mitochondrial respiration, and upregulated key antioxidant proteins including catalase and glutathione reductase. These adaptations were accompanied by reductions in cellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) emission. Signaling toward biogenesis was enhanced, demonstrated by increases in mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC)-1α nuclear translocation, PGC-1α promoter activity, mitochondrial content, and organelle branching, suggestive of a larger, more interconnected mitochondrial pool. These mitochondrial adaptations were accompanied by an increase in lysosomal proteins, suggesting coordinated regulation. There was no difference in mitochondrial and antioxidant-related proteins between CCA and non-CCA SFN-treated cells. Our data suggest that SFN activates signaling cascades that are common to those produced by contractile activity, indicating that SFN-centered therapeutic strategies may improve the mitochondrial phenotype in skeletal muscle.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Nrf-2 is a transcription factor that has been implicated in mitigating oxidative stress and regulating mitochondrial homeostasis. However, limited research has demonstrated how Nrf-2-mediated adaptations compare with those produced by exercise. To investigate this, we treated myotubes with Sulforaphane, a well-established Nrf-2 activator, and combined this with stimulation-induced chronic contractile activity to model exercise training. Our work is the first to establish that sulforaphane mimics training-induced mitochondrial adaptations, including enhancements in respiration, biogenesis, and dynamics.",

      "abstract": "Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most prevalent malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents worldwide. Identification of novel therapeutic targets and development of targeted drugs are one of the most feasible strategies for OS treatment. Ferroptosis, a recently discovered mode of programmed cell death, has been implicated as a potential strategy for cancer therapy. Sulforaphane (SFN), the main bioactive compound derived from cruciferous vegetables, has shown potential anti-cancer effects with negligible toxicity. However, the role of ferroptosis in the effect of SFN on OS remains unknown. In the present study, we found that SFN acted as a potent ferroptosis inducer in OS, which was demonstrated by various inhibitors of cell death. The SFN-induced ferroptotic cell death was characterized by elevated ROS levels, lipid peroxidation, and GSH depletion, which was dependent on decreased levels of SLC7A11. Mechanically, SFN directly targeted p62 protein and enhanced p62/SLC7A11 protein-protein interaction, thereby promoting the lysosomal degradation of SLC7A11 and triggering ferroptosis. Notably, both subcutaneous and intratibial OS models in nude mice confirmed the ferroptosis associated anti-cancer efficacy of SFN in vivo. Hence, our findings demonstrate that SFN exerts its anti-cancer effects through inducing SLC7A11-dependent ferroptosis in OS, providing compelling evidence for the application of SFN in OS treatment.",

      "abstract": "Efficient signal transduction that mediates mitochondrial turnover is a strong determinant of metabolic health in skeletal muscle. Of these pathways, our focus was aimed towards the enhancement of antioxidant capacity, mitophagy, and mitochondrial biogenesis. While physical activity is an excellent inducer of mitochondrial turnover, its ability to ubiquitously activate and enhance mitochondrial turnover prevents definitive differentiation of the contribution made by each pathway. Therefore, we employed three agents, Sulforaphane (SFN), Urolithin A (UroA), and ZLN005 (ZLN), which are activators of important biological markers involved in antioxidant signaling, mitophagy, and biogenesis, respectively. We investigated the time-dependent changes in proteins related to each mechanism in C2C12 myotubes. SFN treatment resulted in increased nuclear localization of the transcription factor Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf-2) after 4 ​hour (h), with subsequent 2-fold increases in the antioxidant enzymes Nicotinamide Quinone Oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and Heme-Oxygenase-1 (HO-1) by 24 ​h and 48 ​h. Mitochondrial respiration and ATP production were significantly increased by both 24 h and 48 ​h. UroA showed a 2-fold increase in AMP-activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) after 4 ​h, which led to a modest 30% increase in whole cell mitophagy markers p62 and LC3, after 48 ​h. This was accompanied by a reduction in cellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), detected with the CellROX Green reagent. Mitophagy flux measurements showed mitophagy activation as both LC3-II and p62 flux increased with UroA at 24-h and 48-h time points, respectively. Finally, AMPK activation was observed by 4 ​h, in addition to a 2-fold increase in Mitochondrial Transcription Factor A (TFAM) promoter activity by 24 ​h of ZLN treatment following transient transfection of a TFAM promoter-luciferase construct. Mitochondrial respiration and ATP production were enhanced by 24 ​h. Our results suggest that early time points of treatment increase upstream pathway activity, whereas later time points represent the increased phenotypic expression of related downstream markers. Our findings suggest that the spatiotemporal progression of these mechanisms following drug treatment is another important factor to consider when examining subcellular changes towards mitochondrial turnover in muscle."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is difficult to treat early as it has no early symptoms. The presence of sulforaphane (SFN) in cruciferous vegetables has been found to possess anti-cancer effects in gastric and colon cancers. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β), a serine/threonine kinase, plays a significant role in pancreatic cancer progression, influencing tumor growth, metastasis, and treatment resistance. Targeting GSK-3β has shown potential to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy. However, the mechanism underlying the anticancer effects of SFN on pancreatic cancer through GSK-3β is unclear. AIMS: In this study, we examined the anticancer effects of SFN in human pancreatic cancer cell line Mia PaCa-2 and evaluated its molecular mechanisms with respect to the GSK-3β-related pathway. METHODS AND RESULTS: SFN increased the protein expression of the phosphorylated form of GSK3β (Ser9). In the Wingless Int-1 homolog/β-catenin pathway, GSK3β induced apoptosis by phosphorylating β-catenin. However, in mutant Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog-like-dependent cells such as Mia PaCa-2, GSK3β was suppressed and the β-catenin level was increased, thus inducing apoptosis. Indeed, SFN increased the protein expression of β-catenin in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Subsequently, we measured the level of cMyc, the target gene of β-catenin. SFN decreased cMyc expression despite an increase in the β-catenin. We measured the expression of nuclear factor (NF)-κB, a downstream factor of GSK3β and an upstream factor of cMyc. SFN decreased the expression of NF-κB and cMyc, indicating that SFN inhibits cell proliferation by suppressing the GSK3β/NF-κB/cMyc pathway. As the suppression of NF-κB results in a decrease in B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) which is the anti-apoptotic gene, we tested the effect of SFN in the expression of BCL-2. SFN inhibited the expression of BCL-2 and increased the ratio of the apoptotic regulator gene BCL-2 associated X (BAX), where SFN induced the cleaved cysteine aspartase-3 and poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that SFN may have therapeutic potential in the inhibition of pancreatic cancer.",

      "abstract": "Renal fibrosis is a common pathological process of progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, effective therapy is constrained currently. Autophagy is an important mechanism in kidney injury and repairment but its exact role in renal fibrosis was discrepant according to previous studies. Sulforaphane (SFN), a natural plant compound, has been explored as a promising nutritional therapy for a variety of diseases. But the salutary effect and underlying mechanism of SFN on CKD have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effect of SFN on renal fibrosis in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mice. Then we examined the regulatory effect of SFN on autophagy-related proteins in renal fibroblasts and renal tubular epithelial cells. Our results showed that sulforaphane could significantly alleviate renal fibrosis in UUO mice. In vitro, the expression levels of autophagy-related protein showed that SFN could upregulate the autophagy activity of renal interstitial fibroblasts and downregulate the autophagy activity of renal tubular epithelial cells. Furthermore, we found that phosphorylated mTOR protein levels was reduced in renal fibroblasts and increased in renal tubular epithelial cells after SFN treatment. Our results strongly suggested that SFN could alleviate renal fibrosis through dual regulation of mTOR-mediated autophagy pathway. This finding may provide a new perspective on the renal salutary effect of SFN and provide a preclinical rationale for exploring the therapeutic potential of SFN to slow down renal fibrosis.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the neuroprotective effect and molecular mechanism of sulforaphane (SFN) on acute carbon monoxide poisoning (ACOP) in rats. METHODS: A total of 135 healthy adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into normal control group, ACOP model group, and SFN intervention group, with 45 rats in each group. The ACOP animal model was reproduced using carbon monoxide (CO) inhalation in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, while the normal control group was allowed to breathe fresh air freely. The rats in the SFN intervention group received intraperitoneal injection of SFN at a dose of 20 mg/kg once daily starting 2 hours after CO poisoning and continuing until euthanasia. The normal control group and the ACOP model group received equivalent volume of saline injection. Three rats from each group were sacrificed 1 day after intervention to observe the changes in the ultrastructure of neuronal mitochondria in brain tissues under transmission electron microscopy. Six rats from each group were evaluated for cognitive function using neurobehavioral test 7 days after intervention. Brain tissues of 6 rats in each group were collected 1, 3, and 7 days after intervention, and the expressions of phosphorylated-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK), mitofusin 2 (MFN2), and dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) were detected using immunohistochemistry staining and Western blotting. Linear regression analysis was performed to assess the correlations between the expression levels of above proteins. RESULTS: In the normal control group, the rats did not exhibit any abnormalities in cognitive function or the ultrastructure of neuronal mitochondria in brain tissues. ACOP induced cognitive impairment and ultrastructural injury to neuronal mitochondria in rats. However, SFN significantly improved cognitive function in poisoned rats and mitigated the extent of neuronal mitochondrial damage. Over poisoning time, the expression levels of p-AMPK and MFN2 in the brain tissues of ACOP rats were gradually decreased, while the expression level of DRP1 was gradually increased. Compared with the normal control group, the ACOP model group showed significant differences in the expressions of p-AMPK, MFN2, and DRP1. After SFN intervention, the expression levels of above proteins were significantly reversed. Compared with the ACOP model group, the SFN intervention group exhibited a marked increase in the expressions of p-AMPK and MFN2 [p-AMPK positive expression (A value): 0.226±0.003 vs. 0.177±0.033, p-AMPK protein (p-AMPK/GAPDH): 1.41±0.05 vs. 0.89±0.05, MFN2 positive expression (A value): 0.241±0.004 vs. 0.165±0.007, MFN2 protein (MFN2/GAPDH): 1.33±0.04 vs. 0.79±0.03, all P < 0.05], along with a significant decrease in DRP1 expression [DRP1 positive expression (A value): 0.103±0.002 vs. 0.214±0.011, DRP1 protein (DRP1/GAPDH): 1.00±0.03 vs. 1.50±0.03, both P < 0.05]. Linear regression analysis revealed a strong negative linear correlation between DRP1 protein expression and MFN2, p-AMPK protein expressions (R2 values were 0.977 and 0.971, both P < 0.01), and a positive linear correlation between p-AMPK protein expression and MFN2 protein expression (R2 = 0.985, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: SFN can help maintain neuronal mitochondrial homeostasis by activating the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway, thereby alleviating neuronal injury caused by ACOP.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Subconjunctival fibrosis is the main cause of failure after glaucoma filtration surgery. We explored the effects of sulforaphane (SFN) on the conversion of human Tenon's fibroblasts (HTFs) into myofibroblasts, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-induced contraction of collagen gel, and inflammation. METHODS: After treatment with the combination of TGF-β and SFN or TGF-β alone, primary HTFs were subjected to a three-dimensional collagen contraction experiment to examine their contractility. Levels of α smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM), and phosphorylation of various signaling molecules were determined by western blot or quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Fluorescence microscopy was employed to examine stress fiber formation in HTFs. The expressions of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) were determined using RT-qPCR. RESULTS: The contraction of myofibroblasts caused by TGF-β was significantly suppressed by SFN. This suppressive effect was exerted via the differentiation of HTFs into myofibroblasts by inhibiting the production of fibronectin and the expression of α-SMA. Moreover, SFN treatment reduced the expression of TGF-β-promoted integrins β1 and α5, myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, and stress fiber formation, as well as the expression of IL-6, IL-8, and CTGF. Finally, TGF-β-induced Smad2/3 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylations were attenuated by SFN. CONCLUSIONS: SFN inhibits HTF contractility, differentiation into myofibroblasts, and inflammation caused by TGF-β. These effects are mediated by both classic and non-classic signaling pathways. Our results indicate that SFN has potent anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects in HTFs and is a potential candidate for subconjunctival fibrosis therapy.",

However, the role of SFN in phosgene-induced acute lung injury (P-ALI) remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the role and mechanism of SFN in P-ALI and provide a theoretical basis for the clinical prevention and treatment of P-ALI. METHODS: A mouse model of P-ALI was established followed by phosgene gas inhalation at a dose of 4.17 g/m3 for 5 min. The survival rate, lung coefficient and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, lung pathology scoring, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) analysis were performed to evaluate lung tissue damage. The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blotting analysis were utilized to evaluate the relative expression levels of inflammation factors and protein expression. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, destruction of alveolar structure, pulmonary edema, lung tissue inflammation and oxidative stress occurred after phosgene exposure. After the administration of SFN, the massive exudation of red blood cells and significant thickening of alveolar interstitium were ameliorated, the lung tissue inflammation was improved, and oxidative stress level was reduced. Mechanically, SFN could increase the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NFE2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) protein and the downstream heme oxgenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), thereby improving P-ALI. And the Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 attenuated the lung protective effect of SFN. CONCLUSIONS: Phosgene inhalation led to edema, inflammation, and oxidative stress of lung tissue in mice. SFN might ameliorate phosgene-induced lung injury through Nrf2-HO-1/NQO1 signaling pathway."

      "abstract": "The increasing incidence of prostate cancer worldwide has spurred research into novel therapeutics for its treatment and prevention. A critical factor contributing to its incidence and development is the presence of prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs). Targeting PCSCs has become key in enhancing therapeutic and clinical outcomes of prostate cancer. Sulforaphane (SFN), a compound found in cruciferous vegetables, has shown effective antineoplastic activity in prostate cancer. Yet, its mechanisms of action in PCSCs remains unclear. In the present study, tumorsphere formation assay was used to isolate and enrich PCSCs from PC-3 cells. Our results found that SFN effectively reduced the activity of PCSCs, including the ability of tumorsphere formation, the number of CD133 positive cells, and the expression of PCSCs markers. Moreover, the data showed that SFN inhibited PCSCs through downregulating the activation of Wnt/β-catenin and hedgehog signaling pathways in PCSCs. Furthermore, the verification experiments showed that the activators of Wnt/β-catenin (LiCl) and hedgehog (purmorphamine) attenuated the effects of SFN on PCSCs, including the expression of stem cell markers, cell proliferation and apoptosis. Meanwhile, suppression of β-catenin or Smoothened enhanced the effects of SFN on PCSCs. In addition, molecular docking further indicated that SFN inhibited Wnt/β-catenin and hedgehog pathways by directly targeting β-catenin and Smoothened. Taken together, our results demonstrated that SFN targeted PCSCs through Wnt/β-catenin and hedgehog pathways to inhibit stemness and proliferation and induce apoptosis. Findings from this study could provide new insights into SFN as a dietary supplement or adjunct to chemotherapy.",

      "abstract": "There are currently 1.2 million people living with HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) in the United States. Virally suppressed HIV patients commonly experience chronic inflammation which increases the risk for other chronic conditions. This inflammation can be quantified with a variety of biomarkers. Some current antiretroviral compounds bring about metabolic abnormalities and promote weight gain often associated with increases in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and an increase in the risk of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Sulforaphane, an isothiocyanate found in cruciferous vegetables, has shown efficacy in animal models by reducing lipid levels, lowering inflammatory markers, and decreasing fat mass. A double-blind randomized controlled pilot study with 14 virally suppressed HIV patients was conducted to evaluate the effects of 40 mg (225 μmol) of sulforaphane, once daily, over 12 weeks, followed by a 4-week washout period. There was a significant decrease in C-reactive protein compared to the control group (p = 0.019). Sulforaphane has been studied in a multitude of conditions and diseases, but this is the first study in a human population of patients living with HIV."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Sulforaphane (SFN) is a naturally occurring isothiocyanate associated with various health benefits, including reduced cancer risk, and has been extensively explored as a potential therapeutic. However, its inherent instability presents challenges in formulation, storage, and administration as a medicinal product. SFX-01 (Sulforadex®) is a patented synthetic form of d,l-SFN stabilized within a biologically inert alpha-cyclodextrin complex. METHODS: The safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of an enteric-coated tablet formulation of SFX-01 were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study [300 mg once daily (46.2 mg SFN), 300 mg twice daily or 600 mg once daily (92.4 mg SFN)] over 7 days in healthy male participants. RESULTS: Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 94% of participants who received SFX-01 and were most commonly gastrointestinal events, which were mild in severity and related to treatment. Following ingestion of SFX-01 tablets, SFN was rapidly absorbed, with a timescale consistent with the enteric coating, and subsequently metabolized. The observed peak blood concentration (Cmax) for the sum of SFN and metabolites (total thiol) across all treatment cohorts ranged from 0.43 to 2.12 µmol/L in 3-6 h. Cmax data were considered inconclusive with respect to dose-proportionality and there was minimal evidence of accumulation of SFN and metabolites. Urinary excretion of SFN and individual metabolites ranged from < 1 to 41%, and the proportion excreted did not appear to be influenced by the dose. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the safety and tolerability of SFX-01 over 7 days and indicated that the pharmacokinetic behavior of SFX-01 enteric-coated tablets was in line with expectations.

      "abstract": "Background: Plant derived isolated compounds or extracts enjoy great popularity among cancer patients, although knowledge about their mode of action is unclear. The present study investigated whether the combination of two herbal drugs, the cyanogenic diglucoside amygdalin and the isothiocyanate sulforaphane (SFN), influences growth and proliferation of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines. Methods: A498, Caki-1, and KTCTL-26 cells were exposed to low-dosed amygdalin (1 or 5 mg/mL), or SFN (5 µM) or to combined SFN-amygdalin. Tumor growth and proliferation were analyzed by MTT, BrdU incorporation, and clone formation assays. Cell cycle phases and cell cycle-regulating proteins were analyzed by flow cytometry and Western blotting, respectively. The effectiveness of the amygdalin-SFN combination was determined using the Bliss independence model. Results: 1 mg/mL amygdalin or 5 µM SFN, given separately, did not suppress RCC cell growth, and 5 mg/mL amygdalin only slightly diminished A498 (but not Caki-1 and KTCTL-26) cell growth. However, already 1 mg/mL amygdalin potently inhibited growth of all tumor cell lines when combined with SFN. Accordingly, 1 mg/mL amygdalin suppressed BrdU incorporation only when given together with SFN. Clonogenic growth was also drastically reduced by the drug combination, whereas only minor effects were seen under single drug treatment. Superior efficacy of co-treatment, compared to monodrug exposure, was also seen for cell cycling, with an enhanced G0/G1 and diminished G2/M phase in A498 cells. Cell cycle regulating proteins were altered differently, depending on the applied drug schedule (single versus dual application) and the RCC cell line, excepting phosphorylated Akt which was considerably diminished in all three cell lines with maximum effects induced by the drug combination. The Bliss independence analysis verified synergistic interactions between amygdalin and SFN. Conclusions: These results point to synergistic effects of amygdalin and SFN on RCC cell growth and clone formation and Akt might be a relevant target protein. The combined use of low-dosed amygdalin and SFN could, therefore, be beneficial as a complementary option to treat RCC. To evaluate clinical feasibility, the in vitro protocol must be applied to an in vivo model.",

      "abstract": "Prenatal ethanol exposure can cause a broad range of abnormalities in newborns known as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Despite significant progress in understanding the disease mechanisms of FASD, there remains a strong global need for effective therapies. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of sulforaphane (SFN), an active compound extracted from cruciferous vegetables, in preventing FASD, ethanol-exposed zebrafish embryos were pretreated, co-treated, or post-treated with various concentrations of SFN. The FASD-like morphological features, survival rate, hatching rate, and vascular development were then assessed in the zebrafish embryos. It was found that pretreatment with 2 μM SFN during 3-24 hpf had no noticeable protective effects against teratogenicity induced by subsequent 1.5% ethanol exposure during 24-48 hpf. In contrast, co-treatment with 2 μM SFN and 1.5% ethanol during 3-24 hpf significantly alleviated a range of ethanol-induced malformations, including reduced body length, small eyes, reduced brain size, small otic vesicle, small jaw, and pericardial edema. Post-treatment with 3 μM SFN for 4 days following 1.5% ethanol exposure during 3-24 hpf also significantly reduced the characteristic features of FASD, decreasing the mortality rate and restoring body length, eye size, brain size, and otic vesicle circumference. Moreover, we found that ethanol, even at a low dose (0.5%), causes vascular development deficit in the zebrafish embryos, which were also largely rescued by SFN treatment. These data indicated that SFN has great potential to be used in the prevention and treatment of FASD.",

We found that sulforaphane regulates 45 targets, including TNF, INS, and BCL2. Therefore, it may help treat AD by reducing neuroinflammation, insulin resistance, and apoptosis. The important relationships were co-expression and pathways. 45 targets were linked to the midbrain, metabolite interconversion enzymes, 14q23.3 and 1q31.1 chromosomes, and modified residues. \"Amyloid precursor protein catabolic process\", \"regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway\", and \"positive regulation of nitric oxide biosynthetic process\" were the main pathways, while NFKB1, SP1, RELA, hsa-miR-17-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p, and hsa-miR-26b-5p were transcription factors and miRNAs implicated in sulforaphane In AD treatment, miRNA sponges, dexibuprofen, and sulforaphane may be effective. Furthermore, its unique physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and biological qualities make sulforaphane an effective AD treatment, including efficient gastrointestinal absorption, drug-like properties, absence of CYP450 enzyme inhibition, not being a substrate for P-glycoprotein, ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, glutathione S-transferase substrate, immunostimulant effects, and antagonistic neurotransmitter effects. Sulforaphane is a promising compound for AD management. Further work is needed to elucidate its therapeutic effects based on our findings, including genes, miRNAs, molecular pathways, and transcription factors.

In total, 320 Fish (56.90 ± 0.40 g) were randomly divided into four groups with four replicates each. The control group was fed the basal diet, the TPT group (TPT) was exposed to 10 ng L-1 TPT on the basis of the control group, the SFN + TPT group (TPT + SFN) was fed a diet supplemented with 10 mg kg-1 SFN on the TPT group, and the SFN group (SFN) was fed a diet supplemented with 10 mg kg-1 SFN. After 56 days of breeding trials, the results showed that TPT exposure resulted in a remarkable decrease (p < 0.05) in final weight, weight gain rate (WGR), specific growth rate (SGR), and condition factor (CF), but an increase (p < 0.05) in feed conversion ratio (FCR) and hepatosomatic index (HSI) of fish. TPT treatment decreased (p < 0.05) the amounts of hematocrit (Hct) and hemoglobin (Hb), plasma complement component 3 (C3) and C4 contents, alternative complement pathway (ACH50), acid phosphatase (ACP) and lysozyme (LZM) activities, liver glutathione (GSH) content, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities, interleukin 10 (IL-10), and SOD mRNA expressions, but increased (p < 0.05) plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities, liver malonaldehyde (MDA) content, tumor Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), and necrosis factor α (TNFα), IL-1β, and MDA mRNA expressions. A histological analysis of the liver showed that a higher occurrence rates of the hepatocyte hypertrophy, nuclear disappearance and hepatocyte vacuolization was observed in the hepatocytes of fish exposed to TPT, and it was accompanied by the dilation of hepatic sinusoids. In addition, the toxicity induced by TPT was significantly improved in the groups that were treated with SFN, and SFN was able to improve growth performance and immunity, alleviate TPT-induced changes in inflammatory factors, ameliorate oxidative stress, and increase the activity of antioxidant enzymes (p < 0.05). The addition of SFN also alleviated liver damage caused by TPT and protected the structural integrity of the liver. Overall, these findings suggest that TPT inhibited the growth, immunity, and antioxidant capacity of Cyprinus carpio haematopteru. Dietary SFN could be beneficial for growth promotion, immunity, antioxidant capacity, and protection of liver structural integrity. Therefore, SFN is a prospective feed supplement for ameliorating the damage caused to fish by TPT contamination."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The objective was to use bioinformatics to analyze the potential key genes involved in the mechanism of sulforaphane's protective effects in  sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) and to identify potential intervention targets. METHODS: Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) gene chip datasets containing gene expression profiles from kidney tissues of SA-AKI patients and normal controls were selected. Upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using GEO2R. Protein-protein interaction (PPI), GO, and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed. Allyl isothiocyanate's target genes were analyzed in the ChEMBL database, and intersections with the above DEGs were presented in Venn diagrams. Rat tissues were examined for FKBP1A expression using qRT-PCR. RESULTS: A total of 17 DEGs related to SA-AKI were obtained (|log fold change| > 0 and P < .05). KEGG pathway analysis indicated that the primary pathways linked to the elevated DEGs were glycogen breakdown, leukocyte trans-endothelial migration, and T-cell receptor, TNF, and NF-κB signaling. The module and PPI network analysis of common DEGs revealed one cluster and four candidate genes, including OASL, TRRAP, FKBP1A, and BANF. ChEMBL database analysis identified 339 target genes for allyl isothiocyanate, and the intersection with upregulated DEGs related to SA-AKI injury yielded two co-expressed genes, FKBP1A and TRRAP. According to the findings of the qRT-PCR assay, the kidney tissues of the model cohort showed significantly higher expression levels of FKBP1A mRNA than the control cohort (P = .0142). CONCLUSION: Allyl isothiocyanate may alleviate SA-AKI injury by targeting FKBP1/NF-κB.",

METHODS: Mouse mpc5 podocytes were divided into four groups: control (Con), AngII, AngII + sulforaphane (AngII + SFN), and control + sulforaphane (Con + SFN). Western blotting was used to detect protein expression of Nrf2-Keap1, antioxidant enzyme HO-1, and apoptosis-related proteins. ROS levels were measured using a ROS assay kit, and cell survival and viability were assayed using the CCK-8 kit. Molecular interactions between Nrf2 and sulforaphane were analyzed computationally. RESULTS: Compared with the Con group, podocytes treated with AngII alone exhibited inhibited proliferation, reduced cell viability, lower Bcl-2 expression, and higher cleaved caspase 3 expression. In the presence of sulforaphane, AngII group showed a mild inhibition on podocyte proliferation but did not induce the aforementioned changes in Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase 3 expression. Similarly, compared to the Con group, AngII treatment alone had lower Nrf2 expression and higher Keap1 expression in podocytes, accompanied by a significant decrease in ROS content. However, in the presence of sulforaphane, AngII failed to induce increases in Nrf2 and a decrease in Keap1 expression, as well as ROS levels. Furthermore, cells treated with sulforaphane exhibited higher HO-1 levels than control cells, and co-incubation with AngII did not alter HO-1 levels. Computational modeling revealed hydrophobic interactions between sulforaphane and the amino acid LYS-462 of Nrf2, as well as hydrogen bonding with amino acid HIS-465. The binding score between sulforaphane and Nrf2 was -4.7. CONCLUSION: Sulforaphane alleviated AngII-induced podocyte oxidative stress injury via the Nrf2-Keap1/HO-1/ROS pathway, providing new insights into therapeutic compounds for mitigating chronic kidney disease.",

Our analysis revealed significant enrichment of genes in pathways associated with the inflammatory response, lipid metabolism, oxidative stress response, and T-cell mediated immunity, suggesting SFN's potential in modulating these biological processes. Notably, the PPARγ gene, which plays a crucial role in the body's oxidative stress and inflammatory response, was highly up-regulated, indicating its possible centrality in SFN's effects. Gene-gene interaction analysis further supported SFN's role in alleviating inflammation through PPARγ, with key genes in oxidative stress and inflammatory response pathways showing significant correlations with PPARγ. Overall, our findings provide molecular evidence for SFN's protective effects on canine intestinal health, potentially through the modulation of inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways, with PPARγ emerging as a critical mediator."

      "abstract": "Testicular ischemia-reperfusion induces enhanced concentration of reactive oxygen species. The increased reactive oxygen species harm cellular lipids, nucleic acids, proteins, and carbohydrates, and ultimately cause testicular injury. Sulforaphane, a kind of natural dietary isothiocyanate, exists predominantly in some cruciferous vegetables, like broccoli and cabbage. It can protect tissues from oxidative stress-induced damage. Herein, we analyzed the effectiveness of sulforaphane in treating ischemia-reperfusion injury occurring after testicular torsion-detorsion. Male rats (n = 60) were grouped as follows: sham-operated group, unilateral testicular ischemia-reperfusion group, and unilateral testicular ischemia-reperfusion group receiving sulforaphane treatment at 5 mg/kg. No testicular torsion-detorsion was performed in the sham group. Unilateral testicular ischemia-reperfusion model was created by detorsion after 2 h of left testicular torsion. In the sulforaphane-treated group, intraperitoneal sulforaphane (5 mg/kg) was administered at left testicular detorsion. Biochemical assay, Western blot, and hematoxylin and eosin staining were used to evaluate testicular malondialdehyde content (an important marker of reactive oxygen species), protein levels of superoxide dismutase and catalase (intracellular antioxidant defense mechanism), and testicular reproductive function, respectively. In testicular tissues, malondialdehyde content was significantly promoted, while protein levels of superoxide dismutase and catalase, and testicular reproductive function were significantly reduced in ipsilateral testes by testicular ischemia-reperfusion. Nevertheless, sulforaphane administration partially reversed the effect of testicular ischemia-reperfusion on these indexes. It can be concluded that sulforaphane elevates protein levels of superoxide dismutase and catalase, and suppresses reactive oxygen species content, thereby preventing ischemia-reperfusion injury in testis.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: A shifted CR mouse model with HFD is constructed. Biochemical analyses are used to evaluate the effects of SFN on lipid accumulation and liver function. Targeted metabolomics is used for liver metabolites. Results from hematoxylin and eosin staining and Oil Red O staining show that SFN improves liver lipid accumulation and intestinal inflammatory damage in shifted CR treatment with HFD. The concentrations of amino acid metabolites are increased, and the levels of bile acid metabolites are significantly decreased by SFN treatment. Results from 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicate that SFN modulates gut microbiota, particularly by enhancing beneficial bacteria such as Lachnospiraceae, Lactobacillus, Alistipes, Akkermansia, and Eubacteriaum coprostanoligenes. Correlation analysis confirms a close relationship between intestinal microbiota and hepatic metabolites. SFN significantly regulates CR protein expression in the hypothalamus and liver tissues. CONCLUSION: SFN alleviates hepatic metabolic disorder and gut microbiota dysbiosis induced by CR disruption under a high-fat diet in a mouse model, indicating the potential of SFN in regulating CR disruption.",

      "abstract": "Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) is a common plasticizer with a deleterious impact on testicular functionality and male fertility. Growing evidence implicates ferroptosis as one of the plausible mechanisms for DEHP-induced testicular injury. Sulforaphane (SFN) is a natural isothiocyanate displaying beneficial effects on testicular injury in several animal models. Herein, we explored the potential protective effect of SFN on testicular ferroptosis and toxicity evoked by DEHP. Adult male Wistar rats were equally distributed into three groups (n = 6/group): (i) CON group; (ii) DEHP group, received DEHP (2 g/kg PO) for 4 weeks; and (iii) DEHP + SFN group, received SFN (10 mg/kg, PO) 1 week prior to DEHP then concurrently with DEHP for further 4 weeks. Compared to CON group, exposure to DEHP caused testicular atrophy, deteriorated testicular architecture, testicular fibrosis, reduced sperm count and motility, higher sperm deformity, and declined serum testosterone level. All these abnormalities were ameliorated by SFN preconditioning. Additionally, pretreatment with SFN reversed the increased aromatase level and upregulated the steroidogenic markers in testes of DEHP-exposed rats. SFN pretreatment also counteracted DEHP-induced oxidative stress and boosted the total antioxidant capacity in testicular tissue via activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF-2) and its downstream target, hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1). Moreover, SFN preconditioning mitigated DEHP-induced ferroptosis through up-surging SLC7A11, GPX-4, and GSH, while suppressing iron overload and ACSL4-induced lipid peroxidation in testicular tissue of rats. These findings may nominate SFN as a promising protective intervention to alleviate testicular ferroptosis associated with DEHP exposure through activation of NRF-2/SLC7A11/GPX-4 trajectory.",

The elevated expression of HO-1 has been associated with markedly accelerated peripheral nerve regeneration. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a naturally occurring dietary Nrf2/HO-1 activator-sulforaphane (SFN)-on regeneration in a murine sciatic nerve crush model. The beneficial safety profile of SFN has been thoroughly investigated and confirmed several times. Here, SFN was administered daily, starting immediately after C57BL/6 mice were subjected to sciatic nerve crush injury. Injured sciatic nerves were excised at various time points post injury for molecular, immunohistochemical and morphometric analyses. Moreover, functional assessment was performed by grip strength analysis and electrophysiology. Following SFN treatment, the early response to injury includes a modulation of autophagic pathways and marked upregulation of Nrf2/HO-1 expression. This enhancement of HO-1 expression was maintained throughout the regeneration phase and accompanied by a significant increase in repair Schwann cells. In these cells, elevated proliferation rates were observed. Significant improvements in grip strength test performance, nerve conduction velocity and remyelination were also noted following SFN treatment. Collectively, SFN modulates cytoprotective and autophagic pathways in the injured nerve, increasing the number of repair Schwann cells and contributing to effective nerve regeneration. Given the availability of SFN as a nutritional supplement, this compound might constitute a novel regenerative approach with broad patient accessibility and further studies on this topic are warranted."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer (PC), sometimes referred to as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), is a major cause of global mortality from cancer. Pancreatic cancer is a very aggressive and devastating kind of cancer, characterized by limited options for therapy and low possibilities of survival. Sulforaphane (SFN), a naturally occurring sulfur-containing compound, is believed to possess anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity, and anti-cancer characteristics. OBJECTIVE: However, efficient preventative and treatment measures are essential and SFN has been studied for its ability to suppress pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and induce apoptosis. METHODS: Here, SFN induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in PDAC cell lines such as MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells, as evaluated by cytotoxicity, colony formation, western blot analysis, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection, caspase-3 activity assay, immunofluorescence assay, and mitochondrial membrane potential assay. RESULTS: In MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells, SFN inhibited cell survival and proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The activation of caspase zymogens results in cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase-3, which is associated with an accumulation in the sub G1 phase. Furthermore, SFN increased ROS level and γH2A.X expression while decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). Notably, the ROS scavenger N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) was shown to reverse SFN-induced cytotoxicity and ROS level. Subsequently, SFN-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction as a Trojan horse to eliminate pancreatic cancer cells via ROS-mediated pathways were used to inhibit pancreatic cancer cells. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our data demonstrates that SFN-induced cell death follows the apoptosis pathway, making it a viable target for therapeutic interventions against pancreatic cancer."

      "abstract": "The intricate nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has presented significant hurdles in the development of effective interventions. Sulforaphane (SFN) is of interest due to its antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties, which could address various aspects of AD pathology. This study explores the potential of SFN in a rat model of AD induced by Aβ (1-42) peptides. AD symptoms were triggered in rats by injecting Aβ (1-42) peptides directly into their cerebral ventricles. SFN (10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg), Trigonelline (10 mg/kg), and Pioglitazone (10 mg/kg) were administered in Aβ (1-42) treated animals. Behavioral assessments were performed using the Novel Object Recognition tests. Various biochemical parameters, such as soluble Aβ (1-42), IRS-S312, GSK-3β, TNF-α, acetylcholinesterase, nitrite levels, lipid peroxidation, and reduced glutathione activity, were quantified using ELISA kits and spectrophotometric assays. Histopathological analyses included Hematoxylin and Eosin, Crystal Violet, Congo red, and IRS-1 Immunohistochemistry staining. Quantification was performed to assess neuronal loss and Aβ plaque burden. The novelty of this study lies in its comprehensive evaluation of SFN's impact on multiple AD-related pathways at dual doses. The Novel Object Recognition test revealed that SFN, especially at higher doses, improved memory deficits induced by Aβ (1-42). Biochemically, SFN reduced hippocampal Aβ levels, IRS-S312, GSK-3β, TNF-α, and acetylcholinesterase activity, while increasing glutathione levels, all in a dose-dependent manner. Histopathological analyses further confirmed SFN's protective role against Aβ-induced neuronal damage, amyloidosis, and changes in insulin signaling. These results highlight SFN's potential as a multifaceted therapeutic agent for AD, offering a promising avenue for treatment due to its antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties. The inclusion of combination treatments with Trigonelline and Pioglitazone alongside SFN offers insights into potential synergistic effects, which could pave the way for developing combination therapies for AD.",

      "abstract": "Sulforaphane (SFN) is an organosulfur compound categorized as an isothiocyanate (ITC), primarily extracted from cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cabbage. The molecular formula of sulforaphane (SFN) is C6H11NOS2. SFN is generated by the hydrolysis of glucoraphanin (GRP) through the enzyme myrosinase, showing notable properties including anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anti-angiogenic, and anticancer attributes. Ongoing clinical trials are investigating its potential in diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes-related complications, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and liver diseases. Several animal carcinogenesis models and cell culture models have shown it to be a very effective chemopreventive agent, and the protective effects of SFN in ophthalmic diseases have been linked to multiple mechanisms. In murine models of diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration, SFN delays retinal photoreceptor cell degeneration through the Nrf2 antioxidative pathway, NF-κB pathway, AMPK pathway, and Txnip/mTOR pathway. In rabbit models of keratoconus and cataract, SFN has been shown to protect corneal and lens epithelial cells from oxidative stress injury by activating the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway and the Nrf-2/HO-1 antioxidant pathway. Oral delivery or intraperitoneal injection at varying concentrations are the primary strategies for SFN intake in current preclinical studies. Challenges remain in the application of SFN in eye disorders due to its weak solubility in water and limited bioavailability because of the presence of blood-ocular barrier systems. This review comprehensively outlines recent research on SFN, elucidates its mechanisms of action, and discusses potential therapeutic benefits for eye disorders such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), cataracts, and other ophthalmic diseases, while also indicating directions for future clinical research to achieve efficient SFN treatment for ophthalmic diseases."

In order to spread, tumor cells must acquire increased migratory and invasive capacity, which is tightly linked with pseudopodia formation. Here, we unravel the effects of sulforaphane (SFN), an isothiocyanate in cruciferous vegetables, on the assembly of pseudopodia and BC metastasis, and its molecular mechanism in the process. Our database analysis revealed that in bladder tumor, pseudopodia-associated genes, CTTN, WASL and ACTR2/ARP2 are upregulated. SFN caused lamellipodia to collapse in BC cells by blocking the CTTN-ARP2 axis. SFN inhibited invadopodia formation and cell invasion by reducing WASL in different invasive BC cell lines. The production of ATP, essential for the assembly of pseudopodia, was significantly increased in bladder tumors and strongly inhibited by SFN. Overexpressing AKT1 reversed the downregulation of ATP in SFN-treated bladder cancer cells and restored filopodia and lamellipodia morphology and function. Bioluminescent imaging showed that SFN suppressed BC metastases to the lung of nude mice while downregulating Cttn and Arp2 expression. Our study thus reveals mechanisms of SFN action in inhibiting pseudopodia formation and highlights potential targeting options for the therapy of metastatic bladder cancer.",

Effectiveness was tested on Wistar rats divided into groups (n = 15) receiving (IM, 10 mg/kg) SFN formulations or control groups (without SFN). This study used a hind paw incision postoperative pain model to evaluate mechanical hypersensitivity with von Frey filaments. TNF-α, IL-1β, substance P, and CGRP levels verified anti-inflammatory activity in the hind paw tissue. Histopathology of tissues surrounding the injection site was assessed after 2 and 7 days post-treatment. To corroborate drug safety, cell viability of 3T3 and RAW 264.7 cultures was assessed. Additionally, RAW 264.7 cultures primed with carrageenan evaluated nitric oxide (NO) levels. All animals exhibited post-incisional hypersensitivity, and F2 (PL 407/338 (18/2%) + HA 1% + SFN 0.1%) showed a longer analgesic effect (p < 0.05). F2 reduced TNF-α, IL-1β, and CGRP levels (p < 0.05). Histopathological evaluation showed mild to moderate inflammatory reactions after the formulations' injections. F2 produced no significant difference in cell viability (p > 0.05) but reduced NO production (p < 0.05). Thus, our results highlight the biocompatibility and effectiveness of F2."

      "abstract": "Background: Insulin resistance (IR) is closely associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and the gut microbiome contributes to the development of NAFLD. Sulforaphane (SFN) is a phytochemical in cruciferous vegetables that could improve lipid metabolism disorder. However, whether SFN can alleviate IR in NAFLD by regulating the intestinal flora remains unclear. Methods: SFN was administered to high fat diet (HFD)-fed Wistar rats for 10 weeks. Gut microbiota was analysed by 16S rRNA sequencing and the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by gas chromatography. The expression of tight junction protein and the numbers of Lactobacillus, Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium were determined by qPCR. The expression of G-protein-coupled receptor 41/43 (GPR41/43) was determined by western blot. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in NAFLD patients with broccoli seed tablets (rich in SFN, 42 mg d-1) as intervention for 12 weeks. Thirty-six volunteers with abnormal glucose before the broccoli seed tablet treatment were selected in the intervention group to analyze their blood glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance index (HOMA-IRI), homeostasis model assessment-insulin sensitivity index (HOMA-ISI) and glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1). Results: SFN reduced blood glucose and HOMA-IRI while increasing insulin sensitivity in HFD rats. SFN reduced glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) activity, and phosphorylation of serine residues of IRS-2 induced by HFD. SFN reshaped the gut microbiota composition of HFD-induced rats and, especially, increased the content of Bacteroidaceae, Lactobacillaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae, which are related to the improvement from SFN of the blood glucose and HOMA-IRI. The increased numbers of Bacteroides and Lactobacillus were the targets of SFN to enhance the expression of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin, thereby lowering lipopolysaccharide content to reduce inflammation, ultimately alleviating IR. Bacteroides and Lactobacillus produced SCFAs, which activated GPR41/43 to secrete GLP1. Moreover, it was also confirmed in RCT that SFN intervention increased the level of GLP1 in NAFLD patients, which was positively correlated with the reduction of blood glucose and HOMA-IR. Conclusions: SFN alleviated IR in NAFLD via the Bacteroides and Lactobacillus SCFAs-GPR41/43-GLP1 axis and protected the intestinal mucosal barrier to decrease inflammation.",

      "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents aggressive phenotype with limited treatment options due to the lack of drug targets. Natural compounds are extensively studied regarding their potential to alter the efficacy of cancer treatment Among them sulforaphane - an isothiocyanate of natural origin, was shown to be a hormetic compound, that may exert divergent effects: cytoprotective or cytotoxic depending on its concentrations. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of its low, dietary concentrations on the proliferation and migration of the TNBC cells in the in vivo and in vitro 2D and 3D model. Results of the in vivo experiment showed up to 31% tumor growth inhibition after sulforaphane treatment associated with lowered proliferating potential of cancer cells, reduced areas of necrosis, and changed immune cell type infiltration, showing less malignant type of tumor in contrast to the non-treated group. Also, the study revealed that sulforaphane decreased the number of lung metastases. The in vitro study confirmed that SFN inhibited cell migration, but only in cells derived from 3D spheroids, not from 2D in vitro cultures. The results show a specific role of sulforaphane in the case of cells released from the TNBC primary tumor and its environment.",

      "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that activators of nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (Nrf2), such as sulforaphane, may represent promising novel pharmacological targets for conditions related to oxidative stress, including depressive disorder. Therefore, we conducted a study to explore the behavioral and biochemical effects of repeated (14 days) sulforaphane (SFN) treatment in the olfactory bulbectomy (OB) animal model of depression. An open field test (OFT), splash test (ST), and spontaneous locomotor activity test (LA) were used to assess changes in depressive-like behavior and the potential antidepressant-like activity of SFN. The OB model induced hyperactivity in mice during the OFT and LA as well as a temporary loss of self-care and motivation in the ST. The repeated administration of SFN (10 mg/kg) effectively reversed these behavioral changes in OB mice across all tests. Additionally, a biochemical analysis revealed that SFN (10 mg/kg) increased the total antioxidant capacity in the frontal cortex and serum of the OB model. Furthermore, SFN (10 mg/kg) significantly enhanced superoxide dismutase activity in the serum of OB mice. Overall, the present study is the first to demonstrate the antidepressant-like effects of repeated SFN (10 mg/kg) treatment in the OB model and indicates that these benefits may be linked to improved oxidative status."

      "abstract": "Sulforaphane (SFN) is a natural isothiocyanate derived from cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage. SFN plays a crucial role in maintaining redox homeostasis by interacting with the active cysteine residues of Keap1, leading to the dissociation and activation of NRF2 in various diseases. In this study, our objective was to investigate the impact of SFN on oxidative stress and pyroptosis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-infected macrophages. Our findings demonstrated that Mtb infection significantly increased the production of iNOS and ROS, indicating the induction of oxidative stress in macrophages. However, treatment with SFN effectively suppressed the expression of iNOS and COX-2 and reduced MDA and ROS levels, while enhancing GSH content as well as upregulating NRF2, HO-1, and NQO-1 expression in Mtb-infected RAW264.7 macrophages and primary peritoneal macrophages from WT mice. These results suggest that SFN mitigates oxidative stress by activating the NRF2 signaling pathway in Mtb-infected macrophages. Furthermore, excessive ROS production activates the NLRP3 signaling pathway, thereby promoting pyroptosis onset. Further investigations revealed that SFN effectively suppressed the expression of NLRP3, Caspase-1, and GSDMD, IL-1β, and IL-18 levels, as well as the production of LDH, suggesting that it may exhibit anti-pyroptotic effects through activation of the NRF2 signaling pathway and reductions in ROS production during Mtb infection. Moreover, we observed that SFN also inhibited the expression of NLRP3, ASC, Caspase1, and IL-1β along with LDH production in Mtb-infected primary peritoneal macrophages from NFR2-/- mice. This indicates that SFN can directly suppress NLRP3 activation and possibly inhibit pyroptosis initiation in an NRF2-independent manner. In summary, our findings demonstrate that SFN exerts its inhibitory effects on oxidative stress by activating the NRF2 signaling pathway in Mtb-infected macrophages, while it may simultaneously exert anti-pyroptotic properties through both NRF2-dependent and independent mechanisms targeting the NLRP3 signaling pathway."

      "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is strictly linked to chronic oxidative stress, inflammation, loss of epithelial barrier integrity, and often with abnormal new blood vessel development. In this study, the retinal epithelial cell line ARPE-19 was treated with pro-inflammatory transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) to investigate the activity of vitamin D (VD) and sulforaphane (SF) in abating the consequences of oxidative stress and inflammation. The administration of VD and SF lowered reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and abated the related expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 induced by TGF-β. We evaluated mitochondrial respiration as a source of ROS production, and we discovered that the increased transcription of respiratory elements triggered by TGF-β was prevented by VD and SF. In this model of inflamed epithelium, the treatment with VD and SF also reduced the secretion of VEGF, a key angiogenic factor, and restored the markers of epithelial integrity. Remarkably, all the observed biological effects were potentiated by the co-stimulation with the two compounds and were not mediated by VD receptor expression but rather by the ERK 1/2 pathway. Altogether, the results of this study reveal the powerful synergistic anti-inflammatory activity of SF and VD and lay the foundation for future clinical assessment of their efficacy in AMD.",

However, the molecular mechanism of the growth inhibition effect of sulforaphane in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has not been fully explored. In the present study, a proteomic analysis was performed on the AML cell line U937 responding to sulforaphane treatment to identify novel and efficient therapeutic targets of sulforaphane on AML cells. Key driver analysis was run on the leukemia network, and TRIP13 was identified as a key regulatory factor in sulforaphane-induced growth inhibition in U937 cells. Pretreatment with DCZ0415, an inhibitor of TRIP13, could significantly attenuate sulforaphane-induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in vitro through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. In addition, the inhibitory effect of sulforaphane on the tumor volume could also be obviously attenuated by the pretreatment of DCZ0415 in vivo. These results indicate that TRIP13 plays an important role in the sensitivity of leukemia cell response to sulforaphane treatment, and these findings expand the understanding of the mechanism of the antileukemic effect of sulforaphane and provide a new target for the treatment of AML."

Sulforaphane (SFN), as a member of the isothiocyanates (ITCs) family, which is the hydrolysis product of glucosinolates (GLs), has been shown to have significant preventive and therapeutic cancer effects in different human cancers. Early studies have shown that SFN scavenges oxygen radicals by increasing cellular defenses against oxidative damage, mainly through the induction of phase II detoxification enzymes by nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). More and more studies have shown that the anticancer mechanism of SFN also includes induction of apoptotic pathway in tumor cells, inhibition of cell cycle progression, and suppression of tumor stem cells. Therefore, the application of SFN is expected to be a necessary new approach to treating cancer. In this paper, we review the multiple molecular mechanisms of SFN in cancer prevention and treatment in recent years, which can provide a new vision for cancer treatment.",

Both doses of SFN accelerated body weight increment. The cross-sectional area and diameter of Longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle fibers were enlarged in SFN3 group. Triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) levels in LD muscle were decreased in SFN groups. RNA sequencing results revealed that 2455 and 2318 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found in SFN1 and SFN3 groups, respectively. Based on GO enrichment analysis, 754 and 911 enriched GO terms in the SFN1 and SFN3 groups, respectively. KEGG enrichment analysis shown that one KEGG pathway was enriched in the SFN1 group, while six KEGG pathways were enriched in the SFN3 group. The expressions of nine selected DEGs validated with qRT-PCR were in line with the RNA sequencing data. Furthermore, SFN treatment influenced lipid and protein metabolism related pathways including AMPK signaling, fatty acid metabolism signaling, cholesterol metabolism signalling, PPAR signaling, peroxisome signaling, TGFβ signaling, and mTOR signaling. In summary, SFN elevated muscle fibers size and reduced TG and TC content of in LD muscle by modulating protein and lipid metabolism-related signaling pathways.",

      "abstract": "Estrogen receptor-negative [ER(-)] mammary cancer is the most aggressive type of breast cancer (BC) with higher rate of metastasis and recurrence. In recent years, dietary prevention of BC with epigenetically active phytochemicals has received increased attention due to its feasibility, effectiveness, and ease of implementation. In this regard, combinatorial phytochemical intervention enables more efficacious BC inhibition by simultaneously targeting multiple tumorigenic pathways. We, therefore, focused on investigation of the effect of sulforaphane (SFN)-rich broccoli sprouts (BSp) and withaferin A (WA)-rich Ashwagandha (Ash) combination on BC prevention in estrogen receptor-negative [ER(-)] mammary cancer using transgenic mice. Our results indicated that combinatorial BSp + Ash treatment significantly reduced tumor incidence and tumor growth (~ 75%) as well as delayed (~ 21%) tumor latency when compared to the control treatment and combinatorial BSp + Ash treatment was statistically more effective in suppressing BC compared to single BSp or Ash intervention. At the molecular level, the BSp and Ash combination upregulated tumor suppressors (p53, p57) along with apoptosis associated proteins (BAX, PUMA) and BAX:BCL-2 ratio. Furthermore, our result indicated an expressional decline of epigenetic machinery HDAC1 and DNMT3A in mammary tumor tissue because of combinatorial treatment. Interestingly, we have reported multiple synergistic interactions between BSp and Ash that have impacted both tumor phenotype and molecular expression due to combinatorial BSp and Ash treatment. Our RNA-seq analysis results also demonstrated a transcriptome-wide expressional reshuffling of genes associated with multiple cell-signaling pathways, transcription factor activity and epigenetic regulations due to combined BSp and Ash administration. In addition, we discovered an alteration of gut microbial composition change because of combinatorial treatment. Overall, combinatorial BSp and Ash supplementation can prevent ER(-) BC through enhanced tumor suppression, apoptosis induction and transcriptome-wide reshuffling of gene expression possibly influencing multiple cell signaling pathways, epigenetic regulation and reshaping gut microbiota.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a significant global health concern, characterized by neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Neuroinflammation is a crucial factor in AD development and progression, yet effective pharmacotherapy remains elusive. Sulforaphane (SFN), derived from cruciferous vegetables and mainly from broccoli, has shown a promising effect via in vitro and in vivo studies as a potential treatment for AD. This study aims to investigate the possible prophylactic mechanisms of SFN against prefrontal cortex (PFC)-related recognition memory impairment induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. METHODOLOGY: Thirty-six Swiss (SWR/J) mice weighing 18-25 g were divided into three groups (n = 12 per group): a control group (vehicle), an LPS group (0.75 mg/kg of LPS), and an LPS + SFN group (25 mg/kg of SFN). The total duration of the study was 3 weeks, during which mice underwent treatments for the initial 2 weeks, with daily monitoring of body weight and temperature. Behavioral assessments via novel object recognition (NOR) and temporal order recognition (TOR) tasks were conducted in the final week of the study. Inflammatory markers (IL-6 and TNF), antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GSH, and CAT), and pro-oxidant (MDA) level, in addition to acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity and active (caspase-3) and phosphorylated (AMPK) levels, were evaluated. Further, PFC neuronal degeneration, Aβ content, and microglial activation were also examined using H&E, Congo red staining, and Iba1 immunohistochemistry, respectively. RESULTS: SFN pretreatment significantly improved recognition memory performance during the NOR and TOR tests. Moreover, SFN was protected from neuroinflammation and oxidative stress as well as neurodegeneration, Aβ accumulation, and microglial hyperactivity. CONCLUSION: The obtained results suggested that SFN has a potential protective property to mitigate the behavioral and biochemical impairments induced by chronic LPS administration and suggested to be via an AMPK/caspase-3-dependent manner."

Blood samples from retro-orbital sinus were used to measure liver function through two aminotransferases (i.e., alanine transaminase [ALT] and aspartate transaminase [AST]) whereas liver homogenate was used to measure glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (antioxidant activity markers); caspase-3 (apoptosis marker); malondialdehyde (MDA) (lipid peroxidation marker); and NO. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cellular energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism sensor, was also measured. Statistical analysis including normalization, analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis test, and significance of P < 0.05 were applied to all collected data. RESULTS: SFN treatment significantly attenuated all tests compared to the induced liver injury by LPS where significant reduction was observed in the levels of hepatic function markers (AST and ALT), lipid peroxidation marker (MDA) as well as apoptosis marker (caspase-3) whereas a marked increase was observed for antioxidant activity markers (SOD, CAT, and GSH) and AMPK. CONCLUSION: These results indicate the protective effect of SFN as it re-instated the levels of antioxidation while decreasing the level of the biomarkers, which were significantly increased during liver injury induction by LPS."

      "abstract": "Excessive oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome activation are considered the main drivers of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and inhibition of inflammasomes ameliorates clinical symptoms and morphological manifestations of IBD. Herein, we examined the roles of NLRP3 activation in IBD and modulation of NLRP3 by sulforaphane (SFN), a compound with multiple pharmacological activities that is extracted from cruciferous plants. To simulate human IBD, we established a mouse colitis model by administering dextran sodium sulfate in the drinking water. SFN (25, 50 mg·kg-1·d-1, ig) or the positive control sulfasalazine (500 mg/kg, ig) was administered to colitis-affected mice for 7 days. Model mice displayed pathological alterations in colon tissue as well as classic symptoms of colitis beyond substantial tissue inflammation. Expression of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 was significantly elevated in the colonic epithelium. The expression of NLRP3 inflammasomes led to activation of downstream proteins and increases in the cytokines IL-18 and IL-1β. SFN administration either fully or partially reversed these changes, thus restoring IL-18 and IL-1β, substantially inhibiting NLRP3 activation, and decreasing inflammation. SFN alleviated the inflammation induced by LPS and NLRP3 agonists in RAW264.7 cells by decreasing the levels of reactive oxygen species. In summary, our results revealed the pathological roles of oxidative stress and NLRP3 in colitis, and indicated that SFN might serve as a natural NLRP3 inhibitor, thereby providing a new strategy for alternative colitis treatment.",

      "abstract": "Changes during the production cycle of dairy cattle can leave these animals susceptible to oxidative stress and reduced antioxidant health. In particular, the periparturient period, when dairy cows must rapidly adapt to the sudden metabolic demands of lactation, is a period when the production of damaging free radicals can overwhelm the natural antioxidant systems, potentially leading to tissue damage and reduced milk production. Central to the protection against free radical damage and antioxidant defense is the transcription factor NRF2, which activates an array of genes associated with antioxidant functions and cell survival. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect that two natural NRF2 modulators, the NRF2 agonist sulforaphane (SFN) and the antagonist brusatol (BRU), have on the transcriptome of immortalized bovine mammary alveolar cells (MACT) using both the RT-qPCR of putative NRF2 target genes, as well as RNA sequencing approaches. The treatment of cells with SFN resulted in the activation of many putative NRF2 target genes and the upregulation of genes associated with pathways involved in cell survival, metabolism, and antioxidant function while suppressing the expression of genes related to cellular senescence and DNA repair. In contrast, the treatment of cells with BRU resulted in the upregulation of genes associated with inflammation, cellular stress, and apoptosis while suppressing the transcription of genes involved in various metabolic processes. The analysis also revealed several novel putative NRF2 target genes in bovine. In conclusion, these data indicate that the treatment of cells with SFN and BRU may be effective at modulating the NRF2 transcriptional network, but additional effects associated with cellular stress and metabolism may complicate the effectiveness of these compounds to improve antioxidant health in dairy cattle via nutrigenomic approaches.",

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) stands as a major cause of cancer-related mortality globally, accounting for approximately 881,000 deaths each year. Traditional approaches such as chemotherapy and surgery have been the primary treatment modalities, yet the outcomes for patients with metastatic CRC are often unsatisfactory. Recent research has focused on targeting the pathways involved in oxidative stress, inflammation, and metastasis to enhance the survival of CRC patients. Within this context, sulforaphane (SFN), a notable phytochemical found predominantly in cruciferous vegetables, has been recognized as a potential anticancer agent. However, the specific mechanisms through which SFN may exert its chemopreventive effects in CRC remain unclear. This study explores the impact of SFN on IL-1β-induced IL-6 activation and MAPK and AP-1 signaling in HT-29 cells. Our findings reveal that SFN treatment not only diminishes IL-1β-stimulated IL-6 expression but also reduces oxidative stress by curtailing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Furthermore, it hinders the proliferation and invasiveness of HT-29 cells through the modulation of MAPK/AP-1 and STAT3 signaling pathways. These results indicate that SFN mitigates IL-1β-induced IL-6 expression in CRC cells by attenuating ROS production and disrupting MAPK/AP-1 signaling. This suggests that SFN holds significant potential as a chemotherapeutic agent for both treating and preventing CRC."

Both electroacupuncture (EA) and sulforaphane (SFN) have been shown to improve oxidative stress and inflammation levels to maintain mitochondrial function, but the effects and mechanisms of their combination on sarcopenia are unclear. This study aimed to investigate the regulatory effects of EA combined with SFN on sarcopenia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SAMP8 mice were used and intervened with EA or SFN, respectively, and Masson and HE staining were used to observe pathological changes in skeletal muscle tissue. Transmission electron microscopy was used to detect tissue mitochondrial changes. TUNEL staining was used to assess apoptosis. The biochemical and molecular content was tested by ELISA, western blot, and qRT-PCR. RESULTS: The results showed that oxidative stress, apoptosis, and IL-6, TNF-α, Atrogin-1, and MuRF1 levels in skeletal muscles cells were suppressed and mitochondrial damage was repaired after EA or SFN intervention. In addition, we found that the above changes were associated with the activation of the AMPK/Sirt1/PGC-1α pathway in skeletal muscle tissues, and the promotion effect of combined EA and SFN intervention was more significant. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study found that EA combined with SFN mediated the repair of mitochondrial damage through activation of the AMPK/Sirt1/PGC-1α pathway, thereby alleviating skeletal muscles morphology and function in sarcopenia. This study combines EA with SFN, which not only broadens the use of electroacupuncture and SFN but also provides a scientific experimental basis for the treatment of sarcopenia."

It is evident that chronic insulin resistance (IR) and progressive loss of β-cell mass and function are key features of T2D etiology. Obesity is a leading pathogenic factor for developing IR. The aim of the present study was to determine whether sulforaphane (SFN), a natural compound derived from cruciferous vegetables, can prevent (prevention approach) or treat (treatment approach) obesity and IR in mouse models. We show that dietary intake of SFN (0.5 g/kg of HFD) for 20 weeks suppressed high-fat diet (HFD)-induced fat accumulation by 6.04% and improved insulin sensitivity by 23.66% in young male mice. Similarly, dietary provision of SFN (0.25 g/kg) significantly improved blood lipid profile, glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity of the middle-aged male mice while it had little effects on body composition as compared with the HFD group. In the treatment study, oral administration of SFN (40 mg/kg) induced weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity and plasma lipid profile in the diet-induced-obesity (DIO) male mice. In all three studies, the metabolic effects of SFN administration were not associated with changes in food intake. In vitro, SFN increased glucose uptake in C2C12 myotubes and increased fatty acid and pyruvate oxidation in primary human skeletal muscle cells. Our results suggest that SFN may be a naturally occurring insulin-sensitizing agent that is capable of improving the metabolic processes in HFD-induced obesity and IR and thereby may be a promising compound for T2D prevention."

Our study investigated the influence of treatment with sulforaphane (SFN), found in cruciferous vegetables, on RV remodeling and redox homeostasis in monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PAH. Male Wistar rats were separated into 4 groups: control (CTR); CTR + SFN; MCT; and MCT + SFN. PAH induction was implemented by a single dose of MCT (60 mg/kg intraperitoneally). Treatment with SFN (2.5 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally) started on the seventh day after the MCT injection and persisted for 2 weeks. After 21 days of PAH induction, echocardiographic, hemodynamic, and oxidative stress evaluation was performed. The MCT group showed an increase in RV hypertrophy, RV systolic area, RV systolic, mean pulmonary artery pressure, and PVR and exhibited a decrease in the RV outflow tract acceleration time/ejection time ratio, RV fractional shortening, and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion compared to CTR ( P < 0.05). SFN-treated PAH attenuated detrimental changes in tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, mean pulmonary artery pressure, and PVR parameters. Catalase levels and the glutathione/Glutathione disulfide (GSSG) ratio were diminished in the MCT group compared to CTR ( P < 0.05). SFN increased catalase levels and normalized the glutathione/GSSG ratio to control levels ( P < 0.05). Data express the benefit of SFN treatment on the cardiac function of rats with PAH associated with the cellular redox state.",

      "abstract": "Sulforaphane (SFN) is one of the hydrolysates of glucosinolates (GSLs), primarily derived from Brassica vegetables like broccoli. In clinical therapy, SFN has been proven to display antimicrobial, anticancer, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. However, the antimicrobial effects and mechanism of SFN against plant pathogens need to be further elucidated, which limits its application in agriculture. In this study, the genetic factors involved in SFN biosynthesis in 33 B. oleracea varieties were explored. The finding showed that besides the genetic background of different B. oleracea varieties, myrosinase and ESP genes play important roles in affecting SFN content. Subsequently, the molecular identification cards of these 33 B. oleracea varieties were constructed to rapidly assess their SFN biosynthetic ability. Furthermore, an optimized protocol for SFN extraction using low-cost broccoli curds was established, yielding SFN-enriched extracts (SFN-ee) containing up to 628.44 μg/g DW of SFN. The antimicrobial activity assay confirmed that SFN-ee obtained here remarkably inhibit the proliferation of nine tested microorganisms including four plant pathogens by destroying their membrane integrity. Additionally, the data demonstrated that exogenous application of SFN-ee could also induce ROS accumulation in broccoli leaves. These results indicated that SFN-ee should play a dual role in defense against plant pathogens by directly killing pathogenic cells and activating the ROS signaling pathway. These findings provide new evidence for the antimicrobial effect and mechanism of SFN against plant pathogens, and suggest that SFN-ee can be used as a natural plant antimicrobial agent for crop protection and food preservation.",

Human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells were exposed to varying concentrations of BPDE (0.25, 0.50, and 1.00 μM) and subsequently treated with 5 μM SFN. Cell viability was determined using CCK8 assay, while migration and invasion were assessed using Transwell assays. Lentivirus transfection was employed to establish NLRP12 overexpressing A549 cells. ELISA was utilized to quantify IL-33, CXCL12, and CXCL13 levels in the supernatant, while quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western Blot were used to analyze the expression of NLRP12 and key factors associated with canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways. Results indicated an increase in migratory and invasive capabilities, concurrent with heightened expression of IL-33, CXCL12, CXCL13, and factors associated with both canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways. Moreover, mRNA and protein levels of NLRP12 were decreased in BPDE-stimulated A549 cells. Subsequent SFN intervention attenuated BPDE-induced migration and invasion of A549 cells. Lentivirus-mediated NLRP12 overexpression not only reversed the observed phenotype in BPDE-induced cells but also led to a reduction in the expression of critical factors associated with both canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways.

Oxidative stress is an indicator of the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and KC keratocytes exhibit increased ROS production compared with that of normal keratocytes. Therefore, oxidative stress in KC keratocytes may play a major role in the development and progression of KC. Here, we investigated the protective effect of sulforaphane (SF) antioxidants using a hydrogel-simulated model of the cell mechanical microenvironment of KC. The stiffness of the KC matrix microenvironment in vitro was 16.70 kPa and the stiffness of the normal matrix microenvironment was 34.88 kPa. Human keratocytes (HKs) were cultured for 24 h before observation or drug treatment with H2O2 in the presence or absence of SF. The levels of oxidative stress, nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) and antioxidant response element (ARE) were detected. The high-stress state of HKs in the mechanical microenvironment of KC cells compensates for the activation of the Nrf-2/ARE signaling pathway. H2O2 leads to increased oxidative stress and decreased levels of antioxidant proteins in KC. In summary, SF can reduce endogenous and exogenous oxidative stress and increase the antioxidant capacity of cells.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of many skeletal diseases by inducing osteocyte death. The transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a master regulator of various antioxidant gene expressions through antioxidant response element (ARE) against cellular oxidative stress and can be induced by various stimulants, including the phytochemicals methysticin (MET) and L-sulforaphane (SFN). This study aimed to establish an osteocyte in vitro model to investigate the pharmacological effects of MET and SFN on the Nrf2/ARE pathway. METHODS: MLO-Y4 murine osteocytes and the stably transduced MLO-Y4-SIN-lenti-ARE reporter gene cell line were used. MET and SFN were used as Nrf2 inducers. The cytotoxicity of MET, SFN, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was evaluated using the CytoTox-Glo™ Assay. Time- and dose-dependent ARE induction was examined by Monoluciferase Assay. The mRNA and protein expressions of Nrf2 target markers, such as heme-oxygenase 1 (Ho-1), NADPH quinone dehydrogenase 1 (Nqo1), and thioredoxin reductase 1 (Txnrd1), were detected by RT-qPCR, Western Blot, and immunofluorescence staining, respectively. Osteogenesis markers, osteopontin, and osteocalcin were compared with and without treatment by immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: The experimental data showed that MET and SFN induced ARE activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner and increased the mRNA and protein expression of antioxidant markers compared to vehicle-treated controls. The protein expression of osteopontin and osteocalcin in the samples treated with SFN were significantly higher than without treatment, and the number of cell death treated with SFN was significantly lower than without treatment under H2O2-induced stress conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Nrf2 inducers MET and SFN increased the mRNA expression of antioxidant genes through the Nrf2/ARE pathway in osteocytes. Notably, SFN increased the protein expression of osteocyte-associated osteogenic markers and suppressed cell death under H2O2-induced stress condition. Thus, Nrf2 stimulators can exert stress-relieving and osteogenic effects on osteocytes.",

      "abstract": "Only 20% of patients with muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma respond to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Since the natural phytochemical sulforaphane (SFN) exhibits antitumor properties, its influence on the adhesive and migratory properties of cisplatin- and gemcitabine-sensitive and cisplatin- and gemcitabine-resistant RT4, RT112, T24, and TCCSUP bladder cancer cells was evaluated. Mechanisms behind the SFN influence were explored by assessing levels of the integrin adhesion receptors β1 (total and activated) and β4 and their functional relevance. To evaluate cell differentiation processes, E- and N-cadherin, vimentin and cytokeratin (CK) 8/18 expression were examined. SFN down-regulated bladder cancer cell adhesion with cell line and resistance-specific differences. Different responses to SFN were reflected in integrin expression that depended on the cell line and presence of resistance. Chemotactic movement of RT112, T24, and TCCSUP (RT4 did not migrate) was markedly blocked by SFN in both chemo-sensitive and chemo-resistant cells. Integrin-blocking studies indicated β1 and β4 as chemotaxis regulators. N-cadherin was diminished by SFN, particularly in sensitive and resistant T24 and RT112 cells, whereas E-cadherin was increased in RT112 cells (not detectable in RT4 and TCCSup cells). Alterations in vimentin and CK8/18 were also apparent, though not the same in all cell lines. SFN exposure resulted in translocation of E-cadherin (RT112), N-cadherin (RT112, T24), and vimentin (T24). SFN down-regulated adhesion and migration in chemo-sensitive and chemo-resistant bladder cancer cells by acting on integrin β1 and β4 expression and inducing the mesenchymal-epithelial translocation of cadherins and vimentin. SFN does, therefore, possess potential to improve bladder cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Combination therapies in cancer treatment have demonstrated synergistic or additive outcomes while also reducing the development of drug resistance compared to monotherapy. This study explores the potential of combining the chemotherapeutic agent Paclitaxel (PTX) with Sulforaphane (SFN), a natural compound primarily found in cruciferous vegetables, to enhance treatment efficacy in prostate cancer. METHODS: Two prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3 and LNCaP, were treated with varying concentrations of PTX, SFN, and their combination. Cell viability was assessed using the thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay to determine the EC50 values. Western blot analysis was conducted to evaluate the expression of Bax, Bcl2, and Caspase-3 activation proteins in response to individual and combined treatments of PTX and SFN. Fluorescent microscopy was employed to observe morphological changes indicative of apoptotic stress in cell nuclei. Flow cytometry analysis was utilized to assess alterations in cell cycle phases, such as redistribution and arrest. Statistical analyses, including Student's t-tests and one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's correction, were performed to determine significant differences between mono- and combination treatments. RESULTS: The impact of PTX, SFN, and their combination on cell viability reduction was evaluated in a dose-dependent manner. The combined treatment enhanced PTX's effects and decreased the EC50 values of both drugs compared to individual treatments. PTX and SFN treatments differentially regulated the expression of Bax and Bcl2 proteins in PC-3 and LNCaP cell lines, favoring apoptosis over cell survival. Our data indicated that combination therapy significantly increased Bax protein expression and the Bax/Bcl2 ratio compared to PTX or SFN alone. Flow cytometry analysis revealed alterations in cell cycle phases, including S-phase arrest and an increased population of apoptotic cells. Notably, the combination treatments did not have a discernible impact on necrotic cells. Signs of apoptotic cell death were confirmed through Caspase-3 cleavage, and morphological changes in cell nuclei were assessed via western blot and fluorescent microscopy. CONCLUSION: This combination therapy of PTX and SFN has the potential to improve prostate cancer treatment by minimizing side effects while maintaining efficacy. Mechanistic investigations revealed that SFN enhances PTX efficacy by promoting apoptosis, activating caspase-3, inducing nuclear morphology changes, modulating the cell cycle, and altering Bax and Bcl2 protein expression. These findings offer valuable insights into the synergistic effects of PTX and SFN, supporting the optimization of combination therapy and providing efficient therapeutic strategies in preclinical research.",

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) has been associated with depression and suicidal ideations in females. Studies have highlighted the role of autophagic deficiency in depression pathogenesis. Sulforaphane (SFN) is a natural product that improved autophagic deficiency and showed antidepressant activity in depressed patients. Herein, the study aimed to evaluate the impact of using SFN on depression-associated with PCOS via hippocampal energy sensors and cellular bioenergetics. PCOS was induced by administering letrozole (1 mg/kg, p. o.) for 21 days, followed by SFN treatment (0.5 mg/kg, i. p.) for one week. Two days before euthanasia, PCOS rats showed anhedonic behavior in the sucrose preference test and increased immobility time in the forced swimming test. Depressed rats showed a reduction in nuclear SIRT1 and an elevated cytoplasmic one. This was associated with a reduction in phosphorylation of energy sensors, liver kinase B1 (LKB1), and adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK), along with an imbalance of autophagic markers such as Beclin-1, microtubule-associated protein I/II light chain 3, autophagy enzyme 7 and selective autophagy receptor P62. Additionally, Nrf2 and KEAP1 levels were decreased. These abnormalities were alleviated by SFN treatment, as evidenced by the nuclear translocation of SIRT1 and the repression of downstream proteins, including FOXO1, NF-κB, and TNF-α production. These changes were reflected in improved behavioral performance in the sucrose preference test (SPT) and forced swimming test (FST). The antidepressant effects of SFN were counteracted by an autophagic inhibitor, 3-methyladenine. Eventually, SFN, as a nutraceutical, has a promising antidepressant effect via restoring autophagic-related depression in the PCOS rat model.",

Plant-based substances, together with their derivatives through analogues, play a significant character in the treatment of cancer by altering the tumor microenvironment and several signaling pathways. In this study, it was investigated whether the natural drugs, formononetin (FN) and sulforaphane (SFN), when combined, assess the efficacy of inhibiting cervical cancer cell proliferation by impeding the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in HeLa cells. The cells were treated with the combination of FN and SFN (FN + SFN) in various concentrations (0-50 µM) for 24 h and then analyzed for various experiments. The combination of FN + SFN-mediated cytotoxicity was analyzed by MTT assay. DCFH-DA staining was used to assess the ROS measurement, and apoptotic changes were studied by dual (AO/EtBr) staining assays. Protein expressions of cell survival, cell cycle, proliferation, and apoptosis protein were evaluated by flow cytometry and western blotting. Results showed that the cytotoxicity of FN and SFN was determined to be around 23.7 µM and 26.92 µM, respectively. Combining FN and SFN causes considerable cytotoxicity in HeLa cells, with an IC50 of 21.6 µM after 24-h incubation. Additionally, HeLa cells treated with FN and SFN together showed increased apoptotic signals and considerable ROS generation. Consequently, by preventing the production of PI3K, AKT, and mToR-mediated regulation of proliferation and cell cycle-regulating proteins, the combined use of FN + SFN has been regarded as a chemotherapeutic medication. Further research will need to be done shortly to determine how effectively the co-treatment promotes apoptosis to employ them economically.",

      "abstract": "Sulforaphane (SFN), which is a hydrolysis product from glucoraphanin, a compound found in cruciferous vegetables, has been studied for its potential health benefits, particularly in disease prevention and treatment. SFN has proven to be effective in combating different types of cancer by inhibiting the proliferation of tumors and triggering apoptosis. This dual action has been demonstrated to result in a reduction in tumor size and an enhancement of survival rates in animal models. SFN has also shown antidiabetic and anti-obesity effects, improving glucose tolerance and reducing fat accumulation. SFN's ability to activate Nrf2, a transcription factor regulating oxidative stress and inflammation in cells, is a primary mechanism behind its anticancerogenic and antidiabetic effects. Its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties are also suggested to provide beneficial effects against neurodegenerative diseases. The potential health benefits of SFN have led to increased interest in its use as a dietary supplement or adjunct to chemotherapy, but there are insufficient data on its efficacy and optimal doses, as well as its safety. This review aims to present and discuss SFN's potential in treating various diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on its mechanisms of action. It also summarizes studies on the pharmacological and toxicological potential of SFN in in vitro and animal models and explores its protective role against toxic compounds through in vitro and animal studies."

In this review, we briefly discussed the effects of SFN on exercise-induced inflammation and oxidative stress. We discussed human and animal studies that are related to exercise intervention and mentioned the underlying cellular signaling mechanisms. Since SFN could be used as a potential therapeutic agent, we mentioned briefly its synergistic attributes with other potential nutraceuticals that are associated with acute and chronic inflammatory conditions.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The imbalance between M1 and M2 macrophage activation is closely associated with the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Sulforaphane (SFN) plays an important role in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of SFN on macrophage polarization and its underlying regulatory mechanism. METHODS: Mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were treated with SFN and an Nrf2 inhibitor, Brusatol. M1 macrophages were induced by LPS and IFN-γ stimulation, whereas M2 macrophages were induced by stimulation with IL-4 and IL-13. LPS-stimulated BMDMs were co-cultured with Caco-2 cells. Flow cytometry, qRT-PCR, and Western blot were performed to assess macrophage polarization. Cell function was assessed using CCK8 assay, transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) assay, and biochemical analysis. RESULTS: Higher concentrations of SFN resulted in better intervention effects, with an optimal concentration of 10 μM. SFN decreased the levels of IL-12, IL-6, and TNF-α, as well as the percentages of CD16/32 in M1 BMDMs. At the same time, SFN increased the levels of YM1, Fizz1, and Arg1 as well as the percentages of CD206+ cells in M2 BMDMs. In addition, SFN enhanced the accumulation of Nrf2, NQO1, and HO-1 in M1 BMDMs, and the downregulation of Nrf2 reversed the regulatory effect of SFN on M1/M2 macrophages. LPS-stimulated BMDMs induced Caco-2 cell damage, which was partially alleviated by SFN. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that SFN may act as an Nrf2 agonist to regulate macrophage polarization from M1 to M2. Furthermore, SFN may represent a potential protective ingredient against IBD.",

      "abstract": "Recently, we characterized the ferroptotic phenotype in the liver of diabetic mice and revealed nuclear factor (erythroid-derived-2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) inactivation as an integral part of hepatic injury. Here, we aim to investigate whether sulforaphane, an Nrf2 activator and antioxidant, prevents diabetes-induced hepatic ferroptosis and the mechanisms involved. Male C57BL/6 mice were divided into four groups: control (vehicle-treated), diabetic (streptozotocin-induced; 40 mg/kg, from Days 1 to 5), diabetic sulforaphane-treated (2.5 mg/kg from Days 1 to 42) and non-diabetic sulforaphane-treated group (2.5 mg/kg from Days 1 to 42). Results showed that diabetes-induced inactivation of Nrf2 and decreased expression of its downstream antiferroptotic molecules critical for antioxidative defense (catalase, superoxide dismutases, thioredoxin reductase), iron metabolism (ferritin heavy chain (FTH1), ferroportin 1), glutathione (GSH) synthesis (cystine-glutamate antiporter system, cystathionase, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalitic subunit, glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit, glutathione synthetase), and GSH recycling - glutathione reductase (GR) were reversed/increased by sulforaphane treatment. In addition, we found that the ferroptotic phenotype in diabetic liver is associated with increased ferritinophagy and decreased FTH1 immunopositivity. The antiferroptotic effect of sulforaphane was further evidenced through the increased level of GSH, decreased accumulation of labile iron and lipid peroxides (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, lipofuscin), decreased ferritinophagy and liver damage (decreased fibrosis, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase). Finally, diabetes-induced increase in serum glucose and triglyceride level was significantly reduced by sulforaphane. Regardless of the fact that this study is limited by the use of one model of experimentally induced diabetes, the results obtained demonstrate for the first time that sulforaphane prevents diabetes-induced hepatic ferroptosis in vivo through the activation of Nrf2 signaling pathways. This nominates sulforaphane as a promising phytopharmaceutical for the prevention/alleviation of ferroptosis in diabetes-related pathologies.",

Preclinical studies have identified multiple agents that eliminate MDSCs. However, none have been authorized in the cliniccal ues due to the safety reasons. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy and mechanism of sulforaphane (SFN) to eliminate MDSCs in the tumor microenvironment (TME). METHODS: We monitored SFN effect on tumor growth and the percents or apoptosis of immune cell subsets in mice models bearing LLC or B16 cells. Flow cytometry, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, immunofluorescence, imaging flow cytometry and western blot were performed to validate the role of SFN on MDSCs function in vivo and in vitro. RNA sequencing was then used to interrogate the mechanisms of how SFN regulated MDSCs function. Tumor xenograft models were established to evaluate the involvement of IL-12RB2/MMP3/FasL induced MDSCs apoptosis in vivo. We verified the effect of SFN on MDSCs and CD8+ T cells in the blood samples from a phase I clinical trial (KY-2021-0350). RESULTS: In this study, we elucidated that SFN liberated CD8+ T-cell antitumor ability by reducing MDSCs abundance, leading to repressed tumor growth. SFN treatment suppressed MDSCs accumulation in the peripheral blood and tumor sites of mice, but had no effect on the bone marrow. Mechanistically, SFN activates IL-12RB2, which stimulates the MMP3/FasL signaling cascade to trigger caspase 3 cleavage and induce apoptosis in MDSCs. Clinically, SFN treatment eliminates peripheral MDSCs and increases the percentage and activation of CD8+ T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, we uncovered the role of SFN in eliminating MDSCs to emancipate CD8+ T cells through IL-12RB2/MMP3/FasL induced apoptosis, thus providing a strategy for targeting MDSCs to control tumors and improve clinical efficacy.",

      "abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays a crucial role in cellular homeostasis. When ER stress is generated, an autophagic self-digestive process is activated to promote cell survival; however, cell death is induced in the case of excessive levels of ER stress. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a natural compound called sulforaphane (SFN) upon ER stress. Our goal was to investigate how SFN-dependent autophagy activation affects different stages of ER stress induction. We approached our scientific analysis from a systems biological perspective using both theoretical and molecular biological techniques. We found that SFN induced the various cell-death mechanisms in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The short SFN treatment at low concentrations promoted autophagy, whereas the longer treatment at higher concentrations activated cell death. We proved that SFN activated autophagy in a mTORC1-dependent manner and that the presence of ULK1 was required for its function. A low concentration of SFN pre- or co-treatment combined with short and long ER stress was able to promote cell survival via autophagy induction in each treatment, suggesting the potential medical importance of SFN in ER stress-related diseases.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Subconjunctival fibrosis is the main cause of failure after glaucoma filtration surgery. We explored the effects of sulforaphane (SFN) on the conversion of human Tenon's fibroblasts (HTFs) into myofibroblasts, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-induced contraction of collagen gel, and inflammation. METHODS: After treatment with the combination of TGF-β and SFN or TGF-β alone, primary HTFs were subjected to a three-dimensional collagen contraction experiment to examine their contractility. Levels of α smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM), and phosphorylation of various signaling molecules were determined by western blot or quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Fluorescence microscopy was employed to examine stress fiber formation in HTFs. The expressions of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) were determined using RT-qPCR. RESULTS: The contraction of myofibroblasts caused by TGF-β was significantly suppressed by SFN. This suppressive effect was exerted via the differentiation of HTFs into myofibroblasts by inhibiting the production of fibronectin and the expression of α-SMA. Moreover, SFN treatment reduced the expression of TGF-β-promoted integrins β1 and α5, myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, and stress fiber formation, as well as the expression of IL-6, IL-8, and CTGF. Finally, TGF-β-induced Smad2/3 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylations were attenuated by SFN. CONCLUSIONS: SFN inhibits HTF contractility, differentiation into myofibroblasts, and inflammation caused by TGF-β. These effects are mediated by both classic and non-classic signaling pathways. Our results indicate that SFN has potent anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects in HTFs and is a potential candidate for subconjunctival fibrosis therapy.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Sulforaphane (SFN) has been found to alleviate complications linked with several diseases by regulating gut microbiota (GM), while the effect of GM on SFN for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has not been studied. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between the effects of SFN on childhood ASD and GM through animal model and human studies. METHODS: We evaluated the therapeutic effects of SFN on maternal immune activation (MIA) induced ASD-like rat model and pediatric autism patients using three-chamber social test and OSU Autism Rating Scale-DSM-IV (OARS-4), respectively, with parallel GM analysis using 16SrRNA sequencing. RESULTS: SFN significantly improved the sniffing times of ASD-like rats in the three-chamber test. For human participants, the average verbal or non-verbal communication (OSU-CO) scores of SFN group had changed significantly at the 12-wk endpoint. SFN was safe and no serious side effects after taking. GM changes were similar for both ASD-like rats and ASD patients, such as consistent changes in order Bacillales, family Staphylococcaceae and genus Staphylococcus. Although the gut microbiota composition was significantly altered in SFN-treated ASD-like rats, the alteration of GM was not evident in ASD patients after 12 weeks of SFN treatment. However, in the network analysis, we found 25 taxa correlated with rats' social behavior, 8 of which were associated with SFN treatment in ASD-like rats, For ASD patients, we found 35 GM abundance alterations correlated with improvements in ASD symptoms after SFN treatment. Moreover, family Pasteurellaceae and genus Haemophilus were found to be associated with SFN administration in the network analyses in both ASD-like rats and ASD patients. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that SFN could provide a novel avenue for preventing and treating ASD, and its therapeutic effects might be related to gut microbiota."

      "abstract": "Recent advances in oncological research have highlighted the potential of naturally derived compounds in cancer prevention and treatment. Notably, sulforaphane (SFN), an isothiocyanate derived from cruciferous vegetables including broccoli and cabbage, has exhibited potent chemosensitizing capabilities across diverse cancer types of bone, brain, breast, lung, skin, etc. Chemosensitization refers to the enhancement of cancer cell sensitivity to chemotherapy agents, counteracting the chemoresistance often developed by tumor cells. Mechanistically, SFN orchestrates this sensitization by modulating an array of cellular signaling pathways (e.g., Akt/mTOR, NF-κB, Wnt/β-catenin), and regulating the expression and activity of pivotal genes, proteins, and enzymes (e.g., p53, p21, survivin, Bcl-2, caspases). When combined with conventional chemotherapeutic agents, SFN synergistically inhibits cancer cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and metastasis while potentiating drug-induced apoptosis. This positions SFN as a potential adjunct in cancer therapy to augment the efficacy of standard treatments. Ongoing preclinical and clinical investigations aim to further delineate the therapeutic potential of SFN in oncology. This review illuminates the multifaceted role of this phytochemical, emphasizing its potential to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of anti-cancer agents, suggesting its prospective contributions to cancer chemosensitization and management."

      "abstract": "Sulforaphane, the native but unstable form of SFX-01, is an antioxidant that activates the NRF2 and inhibits the NF-KB pathways to achieve its actions. Resolving the mechanism(s) by which SFX-01 serves to control the various osteoclastogenic stages may expose pathways that could be explored for therapeutic use. Here we seek to identify the stage of osteoclastogenesis targeted by SFX-01 and explore whether, like SFN, it exerts its actions via the NRF2 and NF-KB pathways. Osteoclasts generated from the bone marrow (BM) of mice were cultured with SFX-01 at different timepoints to examine each phase of osteoclastogenesis separately. This showed that SFX-01 exerted actions throughout the process of osteoclastogenesis, but had its largest effects in the early osteoclast precursor differentiation stage. Thus, treatment with SFX-01 for the duration of culture, for the initial 3 days differentiation or for as little as the first 24 h was sufficient for effective inhibition. This aligned with data suggesting that SFX-01 reduced DC-STAMP levels, osteoclast nuclear number and modified cytoskeletal architecture. Pharmacological regulation of the NRF2 pathways, via selective inhibitors/activators, supported the anti-osteoclastogenic roles of an SFX-01-mediated by NRF2 activation, as well as the need for tight NF-KB pathway regulation in osteoclast formation/function.",

      "abstract": "Sulforaphane, a naturally occurring isothiocyanate, has gained attention due to its tremendous anticancer potential. Thus, an array of sulforaphane analogs were synthesized and evaluated for their cytotoxic potentials on a wide range of malignant cell lines. Among these derivatives, compound 4a displayed exceptional potency in inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cell lines and a negligible effect on normal cell lines through G2/M phase arrest. The lead compound induced reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to apoptosis. Further mechanistic studies established the interaction of the compound 4a with the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-R1) and blocking of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) pathway. This led to suppression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF-2) protein expression, thus increasing the free radicals in the tumor cells. Moreover, compound 4a induced ROS-mediated caspase-independent apoptosis. Finally, compound 4a reduced tumor progression in a 4T1 injected BALB/c syngeneic mice tumor model. In conclusion, this study summarizes the mechanism of compound 4a-mediated ROS-mediated caspase-independent apoptosis. According to the study's findings, compound 4a can be used as a powerful new anticancer agent to enhance cancer treatment."
