      "abstract": "The roselle flower (Hibiscus sabdariffa) has shown potential as an alternative therapy for bone regeneration. This flower extract can induce osteoblast maturation, which is crucial for forming new bone. The study aim was to evaluate the viability of the 7F2 preosteoblast cell line following the application of a roselle flower nanoemulsion extract (RNE).This study utilized the 7F2 preosteoblast cell line to assess cell viability (%). The RNE was oven-dried at 35 to 40°C for 6 hours, resulting in a solid extract. The extract was then diluted into different concentrations. The preparation of 1% RNE was stirred at 1,400 rpm at 50°C for 90 minutes. Primary cultures of preosteoblast cell lines (7F2 cells) were distributed across 10 wells. Well 1 served as the positive control, representing 100% cell viability. Well 2 acted as the media control, containing only culture media without cells, representing 0% cell viability. Wells 3 to 10 were exposed to 1% RNE at serial concentrations of 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 1.56, and 0.78%. The viability of the 7F2 preosteoblast cell line was assessed using the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide or microtetrazolium assay. The treatment was conducted on days 1, 3, and 7 for observation.The findings indicated that the highest cell viability was observed on day 7, averaging 89.27% at a 0.78% concentration, while the lowest viability was 2.60% at a 100% concentration.These results suggest that RNE is nontoxic to the 7F2 preosteoblast cell line."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cancer remains the leading cause of death worldwide, with increasing incidence rates. Natural compounds have gained attention as potential therapeutic agents due to their bioactive properties. Anthocyanins, particularly delphinidin-3-sambubioside (Dp-3-sam) and cyanidin-3-sambubioside (Cn-3-sam), are flavonoids with antioxidant and potential antitumor properties. This study investigates the antitumor effects of anthocyanins extracted from Hibiscus sabdariffa L. (H. sabdariffa), administered intratumorally, and their potential as adjuvants to chemotherapy. METHODS: Anthocyanins were extracted from H. sabdariffa and characterized using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The total phenolic content was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu method. Antioxidant activity was assessed through DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP assays. The antiproliferative effects of Dp-3-sam and Cn-3-sam were evaluated in vitro using MCA-205 fibrosarcoma and CT26 colon carcinoma cell lines. In vivo studies were conducted on mouse tumor models to assess tumor growth inhibition following intratumoral administration of anthocyanins alone or in combination with doxorubicin. The impact on angiogenesis, immune cell recruitment, and long-term immune memory was also analyzed. RESULTS: HPLC analysis confirmed the presence of Dp-3-sam and Cn-3-sam in the H. sabdariffa extract. The anthocyanins exhibited significant antioxidant activity in all assays. In vitro studies demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. In vivo, intratumoral administration of anthocyanins led to a significant reduction in tumor growth. The combination of anthocyanins with doxorubicin further enhanced tumor suppression. Mechanistically, Dp-3-sam and Cn-3-sam reduced angiogenesis and promoted immune cell recruitment but did not elicit an effective antitumor immune response alone. However, co-administration with doxorubicin reversed this limitation, leading to increased immune activation and resistance to tumor rechallenge, suggesting the induction of long-term immune memory. DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the potential of H. sabdariffa-derived anthocyanins as adjuvants in cancer therapy. When administered intratumorally, they enhance chemotherapy efficacy and immunogenicity. However, further studies are needed to optimize dosing strategies, evaluate long-term safety, and assess clinical applicability.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria pose a significant threat to human health worldwide by increasing the harmful impact of traditional synthetic antibiotics. Traditional medicinal plants have bioactive metabolites that can significantly modulate the growth rate, cell survival, and pathogenicity of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Hibiscus sabdariffa L., known as Roselle or Karkade, belongs to the Malvaceae family. It is well-known for its edible aromatic red/purple calyces and is extensively utilized in the food industry and pharmacological applications. H. sabdariffa calyx bioactive phytocompounds have potent therapeutic activities such as antimicrobial, antidiabetic, antiobesity, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. METHODS: This study utilized gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis to determine the volatile aromatic compounds that found in the hydroethanolic extract of Hibiscus sabdariffa calyces. The purpose was to verify the antibacterial properties of Roselle calyces against selective MDR clinical bacterial isolates, including A. baumanii, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa. RESULTS: The GC-MS spectrum profile revealed the presence of twenty-seven volatile organic components, including organic fatty acid derivatives, ester compounds, sugar derivatives, and terpene components. The major GC-MS fractionations and the main active chemical compositions of the hydroethanolic extract of H. sabdariffa flowers were (E)-10-Octadecenoic acid methyl ester (59.23%), 8,11-Octadecadienoic acid, methyl ester (11.51%), Butanedioic acid, 3-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-, diethyl ester (6.22%), Diethyl succinate/Butanedioic acid, diethyl ester (2.35%), and Heptadecanoic acid, 16-methyl-, methyl ester/Methyl isostearate (2.31%). The hydroethanolic extract of H. sabdariffa dried calyces demonstrated potent antibacterial properties (zones diameter of inhibition growth, MIC, MBC, and MBC/MIC) against selective MDR clinical bacterial isolates, such as A. baumanii, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa, as determined by the phytochemical screening (TAC, TFC, and TPC) and antioxidant activity (DPPH). The surface morphological characteristics of the treated A. baumanii, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa clinical isolates have been affected in comparison to the untreated forms by the hydroethanolic extract of H. sabdariffa calyces, as determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In silico predictive investigation revealed that the volatile aromatic components of the hydroethanolic extract of Roselle calyces exhibited significant scoring functions, binding affinities, and non-covalent intermolecular interactions with the MenB lyase and DNA gyrase targets of E. coli. These interactions significantly enhanced the activities of the volatile aromatic components against the bacterial pathogenicity, cell survival, growth, and differentiation of selective MDR clinical bacterial isolates. CONCLUSIONS: According to the in vitro and in silico findings, the hydroethanolic extract of H. sabdariffa calyces has shown potentials as an effective antioxidant and antibacterial treatment. It contains volatile aromatic compounds that can modulate selective MDR Gram-negative clinical bacterial isolates.",

      "abstract": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) commonly associated with fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is gaining global concern because of their diverse biological toxicity. Fluoranthene (Flu) is a low molecular weight PAH and is reported to induce carcinogenicity, cardiotoxicity and skin damages. Currently, there are no effective treatment strategies to protect the host from PAHs, rather than avoiding the PAH exposure. The understanding of the impact and molecular mechanism of Flu toxicity on keratinocytes as well as effective protective mechanisms against the toxic outcomes remain limited. Herein, we explored the protective mechanism of Hibiscus sabdariffa (HS) calyxes ethanol extract against Flu toxicity in human keratinocyte HaCaT cells. In this study, biochemical assays, fluorescent microscopic imaging, real time PCR, western blot and in silico molecular docking analyses were employed. We found that pre-treatment of HS could restore Flu-induced reduction in cell viability through the inhibition of oxidative stress, augmenting antioxidant mechanism, modulation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR)/pregnane X receptor (PXR)-mediated activation of phase I and II metabolism genes. Furthermore, the Flu-induced altered expression of gluconeogenesis-associated genes (G6PASE, PEPCK) and inhibition of ER-α expression were reversed with HS pre-treatment. The constituents of HS including pelargonidin 3-rhamnoside 5-glucoside, 7-methoxyisoflavone and 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin were identified to have phytoestrogenic potential as determined by docking analysis. Interestingly, our data also revealed for the first time the involvement of ferroptosis in Flu-induced keratinocyte cell death, which could be observed through the downregulation of FTH1, GPX4 and SLC7A11 protein expression upon Flu exposure, while the pre-treatment with ferroptosis inhibitor Ferrostatin-1 or HS extract significantly restored those changes. Overall, this present work highlights the harmful impact of Flu on human keratinocytes and underscores the potential of Hibiscus sabdariffa calyx extract as a natural source of protective agents against Flu-induced skin cytotoxicity, particularly through the repression of nuclear xenobiotic receptors and the attenuation of ferroptosis.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The orthodontic mini-implant (OMI) failure often occurs due to the accumulation of peri-implantitis bacteria surrounding it, which results in a stable, resistant form of absolute skeletal anchorage during orthodontic treatment. Administering doxycycline may be the solution, but long-term side effects result in antibiotic resistance. Roselle flowers (Hibiscus sabdariffa) possess beneficial active phytochemical substances, which may have potential as an OMI peri-implantitis alternative therapy. This study investigates the antibacterial activity of 1 % Roselle flower (H. sabdarifa) nanoemulsion (NE) extract (1 % RNE) toward peri-implantitis bacteria in OMIs. METHODS: A phytochemical analysis of 1 % RNE was carried out to examine the active substances possessed in it, such as flavonoids, quinone, saponin, alkaloids, tannins, terpenoids, and steroids. Nanoemulsion characterization was carried out using a particle size analyzer (PSA). The antibacterial activity of 1 % RNE toward Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) was carried out to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration, minimum bactericidal concentration, and inhibitory zone compared with doxycycline as a positive control. RESULTS: Roselle flower NE extract (1 %) possessed flavonoids, quinone, saponin, alkaloids, tannins, terpenoids, and steroids positively. The PSA showed that the 1 % RNE had a size of 98.13 d nm. The antibacterial activity of 1 % RNE against Aa, Pg, Pi, and Fn bacteria at 3.125 % showed significant differences (p < 0.05). The antibacterial activity of 1 % RNE toward peri-implantitis bacteria is lower than that of doxycycline. CONCLUSION: Roselle flower NE extract (1 %) has antibacterial activity against peri-implantitis bacteria at a concentration of 3.125 %."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Conventional treatments for cardiometabolic diseases face limitations related to cost, efficacy, and side effects. Hibiscus sabdariffa (HS) is a common food product and a potential alternative. However, previous studies have shown inconsistent results and lacked assessments of result certainty, intervention safety, and subgroup analysis credibility. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of HS on blood pressure (BP), lipid profiles, glycemic control, anthropometric parameters, inflammatory markers, oxidative stress indicators, and liver enzymes. METHODS: To conduct this umbrella review, a systematic search of eligible meta-analyses was performed up to May 2024. The random-effects model was used to synthesize results from individual trials. Quality, certainty, and credibility of evidence were evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, AMSTAR-II, GRADE, and ICEMAN frameworks. RESULTS: Data from 26 randomized controlled trials involving 1797 participants revealed that HS dose-dependently reduced systolic and diastolic BP compared to placebo and other teas. Although no significant differences were found between HS and antihypertensive drugs, HS showed moderate credibility for therapeutic BP reduction (> 10 mmHg), especially in individuals over 50 years, in trials lasting over four weeks, and in those with a low risk of bias. HS also reduced total cholesterol, LDL-C, fasting blood glucose, and increased HDL-C. A minor, clinically insignificant increase in aspartate aminotransferase was observed without elevating adverse event risks. CONCLUSIONS: HS showed BP-lowering effects comparable to antihypertensive drugs and beneficial impacts on lipid and glycemic profiles. Although HS is generally considered safe, long-term and therapeutic dosing safety requires careful monitoring.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiological properties of beef sausage enriched with roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) sepal extract. The total content of phenolic and flavonoid compounds in hydroalcoholic extract of Roselle sepals was measured by Folin-Ciocalteu test and aluminum chloride colorimetric method, and antioxidant activity was measured by DPPH method. Pectin was used to encapsulate the extract. The characteristics of capsules, including particle size, zeta potential, and capsule efficiency were measured. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) of extracts were performed by tube dilution method. Microbial tests were performed on sausage treatment samples. Analysis of the obtained data was done using SPSS and Excel software. The study revealed that the total phenolic and flavonoid compounds in the extract were 174.6 mg of gallic acid per gram and 16.8368 mg of quercetin, respectively. The extract displayed the highest antioxidant activity at elevated concentrations. Particle size ranged from 16.833 to 640.534 μm. The zeta potential and capsule efficiency were found to be satisfactory. Compared to the encapsulated extract, the free roselle extract better inhibited Staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium), and Escherichia coli (E.coli). During storage until day 20, these bacteria did not grow in the free or encapsulated extract groups. However, S. aureus appeared in the free extract group from day 25 and the encapsulated extract group from day 20. Roselle extract has antimicrobial properties that can improve the quality and safety of beef sausage during storage."

The administration of Hibiscus sabdariffa (Hs) has been described as an efficient supplement in weight loss and in the treatment of metabolic changes associated with obesity. In this context, the objective was to investigate the effects of the association of Hs and HIIT on metabolic adaptations and lipid metabolism in obese rats. Wistars rats were subjected to obesity and subsequently randomized into 4 groups: obese (Ob), obese + HS (ObHs), obese + HIIT (ObHIIT), and obese + HS + HIIT (ObHsHIIT). For 8 weeks, ObHs and ObHsHIIT rats received Hs extract daily (150 mg/kg of body weight) and trained groups (ObHIIT and ObHsHIIT) were subjected to a HIIT program on a treadmill. Nutritional profile, glycemic curve, biochemical profile, and liver glycogen were determined. HIIT decreased caloric intake, feed efficiency, body adiposity, total body fat, and body weight gain, associated with improvements in physical performance parameters and a smaller glycemic curve and area. Hs had a hepatoprotective effect, reducing alkaline phosphatase values, but its effects were more pronounced when associated with HIIT. Therefore, the combination of treatments promoted a reduction in food consumption and body adiposity, as well as an improvement in physical performance and glycemic profile, but without changes in lipid metabolism.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This trial was conducted in Gorgan, Iran. Seventy-two participants with CKD and high blood pressure were randomly assigned to either the HS group, receiving a 350 mg pill every 12 hr for 90 days along with 40 mg of valsartan every 12 hr, or the control group (40 mg valsartan + 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide). The primary objective was to assess the improvement of hypertension, while secondary objectives included the evaluation of proteinuria, albuminuria, kidney function, lipid profile, and electrolyte levels. Molecular docking analysis was performed to examine the mechanisms of action of the isolated components of HS. RESULTS: Out of 80 initial participants, 72 were included in the analysis. Both groups showed a significant reduction in blood pressure (p<0.001). The HS group demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in lipid profile (p<0.001). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups regarding the reduction of renal markers. Molecular docking analysis revealed that the compounds present in HS, particularly its anthocyanins and flavonoids, exhibited greater angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory potential than hydrochlorothiazide in both domains. Moreover, the compounds met the criteria for drug likeness and Lipinski rules. CONCLUSION: Adjunctive therapy with HS showed promising results in reducing hypertension and improving lipid profile in patients with CKD."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Obesity is associated with many chronic non-communicable diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, cancer, gallbladder disease, bone and joint disorders, skin diseases, fatty liver disease, etc. (Wharton et al., 2020)1 The recent report revealed that overweight and obesity were prevalent in 60 % of the adult population. Several studies have been published to determine the effect of Hibiscus sabdariffa Linn. on obesity treatment, but the findings are still inconclusive. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of H. sabdariffa Linn in the treatment of obesity. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL from inception to February 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included if they explored the effect of H. sabdariffa on one of the following outcomes: body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio. A random-effects model was used to meta-analyze the data. I2 was used to quantify statistical heterogeneity among the included RCTs. PROSPERO registered protocol: CRD42023408880. RESULTS: A total of six RCTs with 339 participants were included. Four trials used H. sabdariffa extract in capsules as the intervention of interest compared to placebo, while the other two trials used H. sabdariffa tea compared to black or green tea. Our meta-analyses showed that the mean difference in weight reduction between H. sabdariffa and control was - 0.27 kg (95 % confidence interval (CI); - 1.98 to 1.42, I2 = 0.0 %). The mean differences for BMI and waist circumference reduction were - 0.06 kg/m2 (95 % CI; - 0.58 to 0.47, I2 = 0.0 %) and - 0.20 centimeters (95 % CI; - 2.06 to 1.66, I2 = 0.00 %). No safety concerns were reported in the included studies. CONCLUSION: Our study did not show a clinical benefit of H. sabdariffa extract in obesity treatment. However, further high-quality RCTs with a longer treatment duration and a standard dose are still warranted.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes-induced kidney damage represents a substantial health hazard, emphasizing the imperative to explore potential therapeutic interventions. This study investigates the nephroprotective activity of flavonoid-rich extracts from Hibiscus sabdariffa leaves in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. The flavonoid-rich extracts of H. sabdariffa leaves was obtained using a standard procedure. The animals were induced with streptozotocin and thereafter treated with both low (LDHSFL) and high doses (HDHSFL) of flavonoid-rich extracts from H. sabdariffa leaves and metformin (MET), and other groups are diabetic control (DC) and normal control (NC). The study assesses diverse renal parameters, encompassing kidney redox stress biomarkers, serum electrolyte levels, kidney inflammatory biomarkers, serum concentrations of creatinine, urea, and uric acid, kidney phosphatase activities, renal histopathology, and relative gene expressions of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-1β), comparing these measurements with normal and diabetic control groups (NC and DC). The findings indicate that the use of extracts from H. sabdariffa leaves markedly (p < 0.05) enhanced renal well-being by mitigating nephropathy, as demonstrated through the adjustment of various biochemical and gene expression biomarkers, indicating a pronounced antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effect, improved kidney morphology, and mitigation of renal dysfunction. These findings suggest that H. sabdariffa leaf flavonoid extracts exhibit nephroprotective properties, presenting a potential natural therapeutic approach for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy."

      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the leading worldwide public health problems. It is characterized by hyperglycemia which induces oxidative stress and inflammation, both involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes. We previously showed that Boswellia dalzielii (BD) and Hibiscus sabdariffa (HS) extracts reduced hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. In the present study, we evaluated the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of both plants in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. Two sets of experiments were conducted in male Wistar rats subjected to a single intraperitoneal injection of alloxan monohydrate (150 mg/kg, b. w.). Then, diabetic rats were daily administered with either BD (1st set of experiments) or HS (2nd set of experiments) at 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg orally for 21 consecutive days. Glibenclamide (10 mg/kg) was also administered as a reference drug. At the end of the study, the animals were anesthetized, and blood samples were collected from each animal. Then, oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers in the serum were determined. We found that treatment with BD and HS significantly reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) and enhanced the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT). These extracts also significantly decreased the inflammatory markers tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β). From the results obtained, it can therefore be concluded that BD and HS have the potential to being developed as natural sources of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents that can be used for the prevention or treatment of DM."

In recent years, they are being increasingly used as a treatment alternative owing to their effectiveness against various diseases. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of 15 medicinal herbs on causative bacteria for dental caries and periodontal disease. METHODS: This study evaluated the effects of the extracts of 15 medicinal herbs on growth and biofilm formation in five oral pathogenic bacterial strains. The herbs were processed into extracts, and bacterial strains were cultured. Then, bacterial growth and biofilm formation were assessed using various methods. Finally, the extract of the herb Hibiscus sabdariffa (hibiscus) was analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Incubation of bacteria with the herbal extracts showed that hibiscus exerted a significant inhibitory effect on all the oral pathogenic bacterial strains evaluated in this study. In addition, the pigment delphinidin-3-sambubioside, which is found in hibiscus extract, was identified as a particularly important inhibitory component. CONCLUSIONS: These results lay the ground work for the potential development of novel therapeutic or preventive agents against dental caries and periodontal disease, two major oral diseases.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Calyxes of Hibiscus sabdariffa (Hs) contain anthocyanins, that normalize blood glucose levels (BGL) in diabetic patients. Diabetes also causes memory alterations, which could hypothetically decrease with the consumption of Hs. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of dietary supplementation with a Hs extract on working memory and BGL in rats. METHODS: Diabetic hyperglycemia (DHG) was induced with streptozotocin (STZ, 55 mg/kg i.p.) in Wistar rats. After 72 h DHG was confirmed, and the consumption of Hs extract began (50 mg/Kg/day). BGL and body weight (BW) were measured at 10, 20 and 30 days after DHG induction in controls and treated animals. Learning and short-term memory were evaluated after 30 days with Novel Object Recognition Test (NOR) and Barnes Maze (BM). The gross hippocampal structure was histologically analyzed. RESULTS: STZ-treated animals presented low BW and persistent DHG (BGL <300 mg/dL). Diabetic animals consuming the Hs extract had a dual response: some showed BGL comparable to controls, while others had levels comparable to diabetic animals not consuming extract. Diabetic animals that consumed the Hs extract had a better performance in NOR and BM than the diabetic animals not consuming the extract. At the histological level, hippocampal morphological differences were observed between diabetic animals that consumed the extract and those that did not. DISCUSSION: The Hs extract used here could be a good co-adjuvant in the treatment of DHG, aimed at mitigating memory deficits and high BGL. These beneficial effects could be attributed to the anthocyanin content in the extract.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This experiment was done using fifteen (15) male rats with average weight of 148 g, randomly grouped into three (3) groups (A-C). Group A was the control group and received no treatment. Group B and C were orally administered with 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg of MEHS, respectively. The animals received the extract once a day for twenty-one (21) days. The hypothalamus was harvested on the last day of administration to investigate antioxidant levels, histopathology, and Kiss1 gene expression. RESULTS: The relative expression of Kiss1 gene in the group C was downregulated compared to the control group (p=0.023). No significant changes were seen in the antioxidant levels of the groups treated with MEHS when compared to the control. MEHS had no histopathological effects in the hypothalamus at both low (200 mg/kg) and high (400 mg/kg) doses. CONCLUSION: High-dose MEHS lowers the expression of the Kiss1 gene in the hypothalamus. However, this effect could not be explained by the oxidative profile or histology of the hypothalamus."

OA and PC's of the beverages (HbD and CD) and the biological samples (urine and plasma) were characterized by HPLC-DAD-MS. Thirthy-eight compounds in HbD and four CD were detected and quantified, equivalent to 937.37 mg and 1.22 mg per 60 mL, respectively. Hibiscus acid was the most abundant OA in both drinks. Additionally, hydroxycinnamic acids, flavonoids, anthocyanins, and anthocyanidins were also detected in HbD, although their amount represented 10% of the total BCs. 25 different metabolites were identified, 15 in urine and 23 in plasma. The microbiota extensively biotransformed PCs and their amount was lower than organic acids, particularly hibiscus acid and hydroxycitric acid. The colonic metabolites derived from PCs and organic acids would be behind the anti-inflammatory bioactivity described for Hibiscus sabdariffa L. (Malvaceae family). However, further studies are necessary to evaluate the metabolites responsible for their anti-inflammatory activity.",

Chemotherapy, radiation, the use of cytotoxic medicines, and surgery are the mainstays of cancer treatment today. Plants or products produced from them hold promise as a source of anti-cancer medications that have fewer adverse effects. Due to the presence of numerous phytochemicals that have been isolated from various parts of the Hibiscus sabdariffa (HS) plant, including anthocyanin, flavonoids, saponins, tannins, polyphenols, organic acids, caffeic acids, citric acids, protocatechuic acid, and others, extracts of this plant have been reported to have anti-cancer effects. These compounds have been shown to reduce cancer cell proliferation, induce apoptosis, and cause cell cycle arrest. They also increase the expression levels of the cell cycle inhibitors (p53, p21, and p27) and the pro-apoptotic proteins (BAD, Bax, caspase 3, caspase 7, caspase 8, and caspase 9). This review highlights various intracellular signalling pathways involved in cancer preventive potential of HS."

Hibiscus sabdariffa L (HSL) is used as a diuretic and could improve renal function. The aim of this study was to assess if treatment with HSL at 2% improves renal function in MS through the metabolites of AA. A total of 24 male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: Group 1, control (C); Group 2, MS with 30% sucrose in drinking water, Group 3, MS plus HSL infusion at 2% (MS+HSL); and Group 4, C+HSL. We evaluated the perfusion pressure changes (∆-PP), the activities of cyclooxygenases (COXs), the percentage of AA, the expressions of PLA2, COX2, COX1, 5-LOX, TAXS and CYP450, and the concentrations of prostaglandins in the kidney from rats with MS. There was a decrease in the ∆-PP, in the activities of COXs, and the expressions of COX2 and CYP450 (p ≤ 0.03, respectively)as well asPGE2, TxB2, and LKB4 (p ≤ 0.01, respectively). However, the percentage of AA and expressions of PLA2 and PGE1 (p = 0.01, respectively) were increased in C and MS+HSL. The HSL treatment improved the function and anatomical structure of the kidneys in the MS rats, through antioxidant molecules, and inhibited the pathways that metabolize the AA including that of PLA2, COX2, 5-LOX, TAXS, and CYP450 while favoring the COX1 pathway. This improves the vascular resistance of renal arterioles.",

The calyx were dried under different temperature conditions (- 58 °C, 30 °C, 40 °C, and 50 °C), and extracted with a solvent mixture of ethanol and water (1:4 % w/v). To induce hypertension, the rats were administered with 40 mg/kg body weight dose of N-nitro L-arginine methyl-ester (L-NAME), via the intra-gastric route. H. sabdariffa extract was administered orally, at varying doses (250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg) to the rats. Afterwards, the hypolipidemic, antioxidant, and antihypertensive potentials of the extracts were evaluated using standard validated methods. Induction with L-NAME significantly (p < 0.05) increased the total cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL levels, significantly decreased the HDL levels; significantly (p < 0.05) increased the levels of LPO/MDA, H2O2, and decreased GPx, and SOD activities; significantly (p < 0.05) increased the pressures (diastolic and systolic); significantly (p < 0.05) increased ACE and arginase activities, glucose level, and significantly decreased nitric oxide activity. Treatment with H. sabdariffa extract significantly (p < 0.05) reversed these trends in the hypertensive experimental rats. The hypolipidemic, antioxidant, and antihypertensive properties of the extract from the calyx of H. sabdariffa, which varies with the drying temperatures of the calyx, portends its potential as a curative agent in the treatment of hypertensive conditions, and other cardiovascular diseases."

MDA significantly (p < 0.05) increased, while GSH, GPX, SOD, CAT activities significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in the brain of the experimental rats induced with AlCl3, while treatment with the extracts reversed these effects to a relatively normal level. At doses of 500 and 1000 mg/kg body weight, the extracts of the calyx dried at 30 oC exhibited the highest capacity to increase the activities of GSH and GPx. Also, AlCl3 caused significant increases (p < 0.05) in the percentage inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activities, and a significantly (p < 0.05) lower protein levels in the brain of the test rats, while treatment with the extracts, at low and high doses, significantly (p < 0.05) reversed these effects in the rat brain to near normal.H. sabdariffa exhibited a good potential to protect against oxidative stress and neurotoxicity."

      "abstract": "Looking for a cost-effective and ecofriendly method for wastewater treatment is a global challenge. Therefore, this study investigated the removal of wastewater pollutants using copper oxide nanoparticles (CuONPs). CuONPs synthesized by a green solution combustion synthesis (SCS) and characterized by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), powder X-ray diffraction analysis (PXRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. PXRD showed nanoparticle sizes ranging from 10 to 20 polycrystalline patterns indexed with two peaks corresponding to (111) and (113) reflections of the face-centered cubic CuO crystal. The energy-dispersive spectroscopy analysis obtained in conjunction with SEM analysis proved the presence of Cu and O atoms at 86.3 and 13.6%, respectively, confirming the reduction and capping of Cu with Hibiscus sabdariffa extract's phytochemicals. The CuONPs proved to be a promising decontaminant for wastewater found to reduce biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) by 56%, and very efficient in reducing both the total dissolved matter (TDS) and conductivity (σ) by 99%. The CuONPs removed simultaneously chromium, copper, and chloride with respective percentages of 26, 78.8, and 78.2%. Green synthesis of nanoparticles is a simple, rapid, cost-effective, and ecofriendly method that successfully removed contaminants from wastewater.",

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) represent a broad spectrum of diseases afflicting the heart and blood vessels and remain a major cause of death and disability worldwide. CVD progression is strongly associated with risk factors, including hypertension, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis, and apoptosis. These risk factors lead to oxidative damage that results in various cardiovascular complications including endothelial dysfunctions, alterations in vascular integrity, the formation of atherosclerosis, as well as incorrigible cardiac remodeling. The use of conventional pharmacological therapy is one of the current preventive measures to control the development of CVDs. However, as undesirable side effects from drug use have become a recent issue, alternative treatment from natural products is being sought in medicinal plants and is gaining interest. Roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa Linn.) has been reported to contain various bioactive compounds that exert anti-hyperlipidemia, anti-hyperglycemia, anti-hypertension, antioxidative, anti-inflammation, and anti-fibrosis effects. These properties of roselle, especially from its calyx, have relevance to its therapeutic and cardiovascular protection effects in humans. This review summarizes the findings of recent preclinical and clinical studies on roselle as a prophylactic and therapeutic agent in attenuating cardiovascular risk factors and associated mechanisms."

      "abstract": "The emergence of bacteria that are resistant to several antibiotics has represented a serious hazard to human health globally. Bioactive metabolites from medicinal plants have a wide spectrum of therapeutic possibilities against resistant bacteria. Therefore, this study was performed to investigate the antibacterial efficacy of various extracts of three medicinal plants as Salvia officinalis L., Ziziphus spina-christi L., and Hibiscus sabdariffa L. against pathogenic Gram-negative Enterobacter cloacae (ATCC13047), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (RCMB008001), Escherichia coli (RCMB004001), and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), bacteria using the agar-well diffusion method. Results revealed that, out of the three examined plant extracts, the methanol extract of H. sabdariffa L. was the most effective against all tested bacteria. The highest growth inhibition (39.6 ± 0.20 mm) was recorded against E. coli. Additionally, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the methanol extract of H. sabdariffa were detected in the case of all tested bacteria. Moreover, an antibiotic susceptibility test revealed that all tested bacteria showed multidrug resistance (MDR). While 50% of tested bacteria were sensitive and 50% were intermediately sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam (TZP) based on the inhibition zone but still less than the extract. Synergistic assay demonstrated the promising role of using a combination of H. sabdariffa L. and (TZP) against tested bacteria. A surface investigation using a scanning electron microscope of the E. coli treated with TZP, extract, or a combination of the two revealed extremely considerable bacterial cell death. In addition, H. sabdariffa L. has a promising anticancer role versus Caco-2 cells with IC50 of 17.51 ± 0.07 µg/mL and minimal cytotoxicity upon testing versus Vero cells with CC50 of 165.24 ± 0.89 µg/mL. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed that H. sabdariffa extract significantly increased the apoptotic rate of Caco-2-treated cells compared to the untreated group. Furthermore, GC-MS analysis confirmed the existence of various bioactive components in the methanol hibiscus extract. Utilizing molecular docking with the MOE-Dock tool, binding interactions between n-Hexadecanoic acid, hexadecanoic acid-methyl ester, and oleic acid, 3-hydroxypropyl ester were evaluated against the target crystal structures of E. coli (MenB) (PDB ID:3T88) and the structure of cyclophilin of a colon cancer cell line (PDB ID: 2HQ6). The observed results provide insight into how molecular modeling methods might inhibit the tested substances, which may have applications in the treatment of E. coli and colon cancer. Thus, H. sabdariffa methanol extract is a promising candidate to be further investigated for developing alternative natural therapies for infection treatment."

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) can occur as a result of micronutrient deficiencies. Hibiscus sabdarifa, a plant used in traditional medicine, contains ingredients that can help prevent this process. This study looked at the potency of Hibiscus sabdariffa Ethanol Extract (HSE) to prevent homocysteine-induced liver damage in animals that were deficient in vitamin B12. Materials and Methods: A comparative study of the effects of roselle extract is presented in an experimental design. Thirty Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups using randomization. To demonstrate the absence of liver damage in the experimental animals under normal conditions, a control group was fed a normal diet without HSE. For the induction of liver damage in the experimental animals, the vitamin B12-restricted group was administered a vitamin B12-restricted diet. To test the effect of HSE on liver damage, the treatment group was given HSE along with a vitamin B12-restricted diet. Each group was given two treatment periods of eight and sixteen weeks. These results were compared with the results of the parameter examination between the vitamin B12 restriction group, with and without HSE, using an ANOVA statistic. The data were analyzed with licensed SPSS 20.0 software. Results: HSE significantly increased the blood levels of vitamin B12 while lowering homocysteine levels. The administration of HSE reduced liver damage based on the activity of liver function enzymes in the plasma due to a limitation of vitamin B12. HSE decreased Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein-1c (SREBP1c) and Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NFkB) protein expressions in the liver tissue, but did not decrease Glucose-Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78) protein expression. Significantly, the levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-a) and IL-6 in the liver tissue were lower, while the levels of IL-10 and Nuclear factor-erythroid-2 Related Factor 2 (NRF2) were higher with HSE administration. HSE produced a better histopathological profile of the Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)-Masson tricrome for inflammation, fat and fibrosis in the liver. Conclusions: In this study, HSE was found to slow the development of liver damage in experimental animals that were given a vitamin B12-deficient diet.",

      "abstract": "The possibility of inducing systemic resistance in roselle against root rot and wilt diseases was investigated using biotic and abiotic inducers. The biotic inducers included three biocontrol agents (i.e., Bacillus subtilis, Gliocladium catenulatum, and Trichoderma asperellum) and two biofertilizers (i.e., microbein and mycorrhizeen), while the abiotic inducers included three chemical materials (i.e., ascorbic acid, potassium silicate, and salicylic acid). In addition, preliminary in vitro studies were conducted to evaluate the inhibitory activity of the tested inducers on the growth of pathogenic fungi. The results show that G. catenulatum was the most efficient biocontrol agent. It reduced the linear growth of Fusarium solani, F. oxysporum, and Macrophomina phaseolina by 76.1, 73.4, and 73.2%, respectively, followed by B. subtilis by 71.4, 69, and 68.3%, respectively. Similarly, potassium silicate was the most effective chemical inducer followed by salicylic acid, each at 2000 ppm. They reduced the linear growth of F. solani by 62.3 and 55.7%; M. phaseolina by 60.7 and 53.1%; and F. oxysporum by 60.3 and 53%, respectively. In the greenhouse, all inducers applied as a seed treatment and/or foliar spray strongly limited the development of root rot and wilt diseases. In this regard, G. catenulatum, at 1 × 109 CFU mL-1, achieved the highest values of disease control, followed by B. subtilis; while T. asperellum, at 1 × 105 CFU mL-1, recorded the lowest values. In addition, the plants treated with potassium silicate followed by salicylic acid, each at 4 g/L, recorded the highest disease control compared to ascorbic acid at 1 g/L, which had the lowest values. The mixture of mycorrhizeen + microbein (at 10 g/kg seeds) was the most effective compared to either of them alone. All treatments, applied alone or in combination in the field, significantly reduced the incidence of diseases. The most effective treatments were a mixture of G. catenulatum (Gc) + Bacillus subtilis (Bs) + Trichoderma asperellum (Ta); a mixture of ascorbic acid (AA) + potassium silicate (PS) + and salicylic (SA); G. catenulatum; potassium silicate; and a mixture of mycorrhizeen + microbein. Rhizolix T had the highest disease-reducing efficacy. In response to the treatments, significant improvements in growth and yield, changes in biochemicals, and increased activities of defense enzymes were achieved. This research points to the activity of some biotic and abiotic inducers that can play a vital role in managing the root rot and wilt of roselle through the induction of systemic plant resistance."

      "abstract": "The calyxes of Hibiscus sabdariffa present multiple pharmacological effects primarily attributed to their high anthocyanin content; however, little is known about their phytoestrogenic effect. Ovarian hypofunction (OH) is a process characterized by the rapid detention of the production of ovarian hormones, which compromises reproductive and cognitive functions. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) efficiently compensates for OH; nevertheless, questions have been raised on its secondary effects and safety. One of the alternatives to tackling OH involves using phytoestrogens such as anthocyanins for their structural similarity to natural estrogens. In a Wistar rat model of ovariectomy (OVX), we recently reported the beneficial properties of an anthocyanin-rich extract prepared from the calyces of H. sabdariffa (HSE) in hindering the adverse effects of OH on memory performance and highlighted a possible phytoestrogenic impact through the modulation of estrogen receptor (ER) expression. We now report that HSE and estradiol differentially affected the expression of ERα and ERβ. ERα was more sensitive to HSE; meanwhile, estradiol preferentially modulated ERβ. Thus, our study leads to further research on using H. sabdariffa as a nutrition-based alternative to HRT.",

      "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome is a complex and multifactorial disorder associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, exacerbated by a sedentary lifestyle and situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent studies have shown that consumption of fruits and vegetables high in polyphenols has a protective effect, reducing cardiovascular risk. Hibiscus sabdariffa (HS) in combination with other plant extracts has recently attracted scientists' attention due to its potential use in the treatment of metabolic syndrome. This systematic review and meta-analysis examines the effects of HS in combination with other plant extracts on the prevention of metabolic syndrome, exploring their synergistic effects and potential as therapeutic agents. For this purpose, a systematic search of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) was conducted in four different databases and the data obtained were then used for a meta-analysis. Initially, the titles and abstracts of 1368 studies were read. From these, 16 studies were examined closely for their eligibility, and finally, seven RCTs with 332 participants were included in both the meta-analysis and the qualitative analysis. Our results show that HS in combination with other plant extracts improved anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, and lipid profile (low density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol) compared to a placebo control group. It is important to note that although this meta-analysis suggests that HS in combination with other plant extracts may have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular parameters, further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and intake duration."

Herein, the effect of 28 KHz ultrasound treatment for 20, 40 and 60 min and 1.5% sodium hypochlorite solution for 20 min was assessed for the decontamination of roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) seeds. In addition, seed germination indices, seedling growth traits, total phenolic content and the activity of defense-related enzymes, viz. peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase and malondialdehyde were measured in the treated seeds. An isolate of Fusarium solani was obtained from roselle seeds and identified as the causal agent of roselle seed rot based on morphological and molecular characteristics. After six days of seed storage, the microbial infection caused the highest seed rot in the control seeds on the average of 56.67%, whereas ultrasound treatment for 60 min could remarkably reduce the seed decay by 3.33%. At the end of seed storage, the fungal load showed the highest (7.72 Log CFU ml-1) and lowest (6.99 Log CFU ml-1) rates in the control and ultrasound treatment for 60 min, respectively. Total phenolic content was significantly increased in ultrasound treatment for 60 min compared to control and sodium hypochlorite treatments. Moreover, the activity of peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase was noticeably improved in ultrasound treatment for 60 min. Furthermore, ultrasound treatment did not show any adverse effects on seed germination indices and seedling growth traits of the roselle plants. Overall, ultrasound treatment for 60 min could effectively decrease roselle seed decay and the fungal load without changing seed and seedling quality.",

Then, the effects of Penicillium commune tannase were evaluated by examining the physicochemical parameters and α-amylase inhibitory action of untreated and treated Hibiscus tea, as well as quantifying catechin content changes using HPLC. Following treatment with tannase, the esterified catechins decreased by 8.91%, while the non-esterified catechins increased by 19.76%. Additionally, tannase significantly raised the total phenolic compounds by 8.6%. In contrast, the α-amylase inhibiting activity of Hibiscus tea decreased by ≈28%. As a novel member of the tea family, tannase offers an excellent means of conditionally producing low-astringency Hibiscus tea."

Scientific evidence associated roselle content with bioactive compounds, such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, and anthocyanin. Most studies focused on their petals, while research on leaf extract on wound healing has never been done. This study aimed to assess the effect of roselle leaf extract on wound healing in rats. This was an experimental laboratory study with a posttest-only control group design. There were 30 rats divided into 5 groups: negative control, 5%, 10%, and 15% roselle leaf extract, and positive control (bioplacenton). The parameters assessed in this research were wound size and histological assessment. The data were analyzed using ANOVA. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Wound healing percentage and epithelial thickness in the 15% group were the largest (84.17%; 64.69 µm). The lowest value was recorded in placebo (64%; 36.33 µm). Meanwhile, wound healing percentage and epithelial thickness of rats in the 5% and 10% groups were 68.53%, 43,57 µm, and 78.11%, 56.49 µm, respectively. Finally, positive control had a 77.44% wound healing percentage and 49.7 µm epithelial thickness. There were no significant differences in wound healing and epithelial thickness among the groups. Roselle leaf extract at 15% concentration showed greater wound healing properties based on clinical and histological assessment. Although there were no statistically significant differences, roselle leaf showed an opportunity to be further investigated as a potential wound healing therapy.",

According to our x-ray diffraction (XRD) results, ZnO-NPs exhibit a particular phase wurtzite structure. The ZnO-NPs are spherical in shape and have an average size of 15 nm, according to the measurements of electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) measurements. Energy dispersion (EDX) analysis demonstrates that the NPs are mainly composed of zinc and oxygen. The zeta potential of these nanoparticles shows that they are very stable. The antibacterial activity of ZnO-NPs was tested using agar dilutions with a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. According to the research results, ZnO-NPs can be established as an extremely specific antibacterial agent for a wide variety of organisms to prevent bacterial growth. Furthermore, the antioxidant properties of ZnO-NPs were determined using the 2,2 diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl hydrate (DPPH) radical scavenging approach, and the IC50 value of 38 μg/mL was measured for ZnO-NPs. Furthermore, the biosynthesized ZnO-NPs showed significant catalytic performance of methyl orange (MO) under UV irradiation. Overall, ZnO-NPs in their produced state have excellent potential in biomedical and wastewater treatment applications. Radical scavengers were used to evaluate the role of radicals in the reaction mechanism.",

Here, we investigated the mode of Phe toxicity in human keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) and the attenuation of toxicity on pre-treatment (6 h) with ethanol extract of Hibiscus sabdariffa calyxes (HS). Cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) alteration, changes in the transcriptional activity of selected genes involved in phase I and II metabolism, antioxidant response and gluconeogenesis, western blot and docking studies were performed to determine the protective effect of HS against Phe. Phe (250 μM) induced cytotoxicity in HaCaT cells through AhR-independent, CAR/PXR/RXR-mediated activation of CYP1A1 and the subsequent alterations in phase I and II metabolism genes. Further, CYP1A1 activation by Phe induced ROS generation, reduced ΔΨm and modulated antioxidant response, phase II metabolism and gluconeogenesis-related gene expression. However, pre-treatment with HS extract restored the pathological changes observed upon Phe exposure through CYP1A1 inhibition. Docking studies showed the site-specific activation of PXR and CAR by Phe and inhibition of CYP1A1 and CYP3A4 by the bioactive compounds of HS similar to that of the positive controls tested. Our results conclude that HS extract can attenuate Phe-induced toxicity in HaCaT cells through CAR/PXR/RXR mediated inhibition of CYP1A1.",

Their anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated in a nitric oxide (NO)-Griess inflammatory experiment. Furthermore, hibiscus acid was found to have a strong anti-oxidative stress effect through the establishment of an oxidative stress model induced by hydrogen peroxide. Several assays indicated that hibiscus acid treatment can effectively reduce extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) secretion and carbonyl protein production, as well as maintain a high level of reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) in skin cells, thus providing a possible mechanism by which hibiscus acid can counter antioxidative stress.

METHODS: Fifteen (15) rats with an average weight of 204g were randomly divided into three (3) groups (A-C). Group A was given no treatment and served as the normal control group. Groups B and C were orally administered 200mg/kg and 400mg/kg of MEHS, respectively. The extract was administered once a day for 21 days. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the relative testicular weight in group B and C compared to the control group (p=0.035). There was no significant difference in the sperm parameters, reproductive hormones, and antioxidant levels in all the treatment groups when compared to the control group (p>0.05). There is a significantly lower expression intensity of the Kiss1 gene in the blood in groups B (p=0.000) and C (p=0.017), compared to the control group. There is no difference in the relative intensity of Kiss1 gene expression in the testis of all the experimental groups (p=0.173). CONCLUSIONS: MEHS caused no histopathological changes on the testis at both doses. MEHS shows the potential of downregulating the expression of the Kiss1 gene in the blood. However, this effect lacks a regulatory mechanism on the reproductive hormones, sperm parameters, testicular morphology, and antioxidative levels.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes is currently a global health problem that is already reported as an epidemic. This metabolic disease, characterized by a disturbance in the carbohydrate, protein, and lipid metabolism, is often accompanied by disorders of several organs. Its treatment is expensive and often difficult to control. Therefore, it seems necessary to search for new drugs and solutions to facilitate therapy and reduce treatment costs. Herbal medicines are becoming more and more popular. Hibiscus sabdariffa (roselle) is a plant that grows wild in a tropical climate. It has been used in folk medicine for thousands of years. Thanks to the numerous active compounds, including polyphenols, polysaccharides, organic acids, or pectins, it is reported to exhibit hypoglycemic, antioxidant, hypotensive, and anti-lipidemic activities and numerous indirect effects that are related to them. The aim of this review was to update the knowledge about the therapeutic effects of roselle in diabetes and its comorbidities based on in vitro, animal, and human studies. After a careful analysis of the scientific literature, it can be stated that roselle is a promising product that can be used either on its own or as an addition to the conventional treatment regimens to prevent or treat diabetes and its accompanying diseases."

      "abstract": "Breast cancer is a major threat worldwide. Hibiscus sabdariffa is widely consumed as beverage in sub-Saharan Africa for its anticancer potential. The present study therefore aimed at scientifically verifying its anticancer effect in rats. For this, 48 Wistar rats (∼55 days) were treated either with tamoxifen at 3.3 mg/kg BW (standard) or with a decoction of H. sabdariffa (125, 250, and 500 mg/kg BW) or distilled water (vehicle). Breast cancer was induced by a single dose of 50 mg/kg of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA). At the end of the 21 weeks of treatment, the tumor incidence, tumor morphology, histopathology, as well as some biochemical parameters in the tumors were assessed. As a result, 86% of DMBA's rats developed mammary tumors. The H. sabdariffa extract (125 and 250 mg/kg) reduced tumor incidence by 63% and 75%, respectively; inhibited tumor burden by 84.86% and 38.78%, respectively, and decreased tumor volume by more than 72% compared to the DMBA group. It also protected rats against DMBA-induced diffuse breast neoplasia, and the optimal effect was recorded at 125 mg/kg. Furthermore, it significantly increases the SOD activity and decreases the MDA level. In summary, H. sabdariffa has antibreast tumor and antioxidant properties in rats, which could justify its common use to treat cancer."

      "abstract": "The development of colorectal cancer involves some morphological changes, and in the initial stage, pre-neoplastic lesions called aberrant crypt foci (ACF) appear. Thus, an intervention with sources of bioactive compounds such as Hibiscus sabdariffa L., rich in phenolic compounds and anthocyanins, could attenuate the risk of developing these lesions due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative properties. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of 5 % and 10 % supplementation of dehydrated H. sabdariffa calyces (DHSC) during the development of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced pre-neoplastic lesions in male BALB/c mice. The characterisation of DHSC was carried out. The in vivo experiment lasted 12 weeks, and the animals were randomly divided into three experimental groups: the control group (CON) and the supplemented groups with 5 % DHSC and 10 % DHSC. The activities of liver enzymes catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase were determined. In addition, ACF, SCFA, presence of inflammatory infiltrates, goblet cells and leucocytes in the colonic mucosa were quantified. There was a significant reduction in ACF and the presence of inflammatory infiltrates in the colon of animals in groups 5DHSC and 10DHSC. In addition, the 10DHSC group showed an increase in the activity of the CAT enzyme, in the production of butyrate and in the presence of natural killer cells in the colon, in addition to more hypertrophied goblet cells. Based on these findings, it is suggested that DHSC supplementation may be recommended to attenuate cellular responses in the early stage of pre-neoplastic lesions."

However, it is questionable as to whether there is a difference in the antihypertensive activity of the hot or cold aqueous extracts. Aim of the study: We designed this study to specify the best method for water extraction of the antihypertensive metabolites of H. sabdariffa and to confirm their in vivo antihypertensive capabilities. Materials and methods: The powdered dried calyces of H. sabdariffa were independently extracted with cold and hot water. A comparative study was performed between the cold and hot aqueous extracts of H. sabdariffa based on evaluation of the in vitro renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition activities. Additionally, both extracts were subjected to an in vivo study for the evaluation of their antihypertensive activities in L-Nw-Nitro arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)-induced hypertensive rats. Further, a metabolomics study was also performed for both extracts to identify their chemical constituents. Results: The cold and hot extracts significantly reduced the angiotensin II, ACE, and aldosterone levels in the plasma. Furthermore, in the myocardium and aorta, decreased iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) levels and elevated eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase), as well as the rise in plasma NO levels, were reported with both extracts, but better results were displayed with the hot extract, leading to a potential antihypertensive effect. Additionally, the cold and hot Hibiscus extracts induced a cardioprotective effect through reducing necrosis, inflammation, and vacuolization that results from the induction of hypertension, an effect that was more prominent with the hot extract. Moreover, a comprehensive metabolomics approach using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was able to trace the metabolites in each extraction. Conclusion: The extracts showed different anthocyanin and phenolic compounds, but the hot extract showed higher contents of specific phenolics to which the superior antihypertensive and cardioprotective activities could be related."

(Malvaceae) (Roselle) calyces and exerts endothelial protection and lipid-lowering activities, which provided a basis for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the therapeutic effects of DP against atherosclerosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A rabbit model of atherosclerosis (AS) was established by 12 weeks of a high-fat diet (HFD). The rabbits were divided into five groups: control, AS, simvastatin (4 mg/kg), and two DP groups (10 and 20 mg/kg). After treatment with DP or simvastatin by oral gavage for 12 weeks, the lipid profiles were measured. Histopathological assessment of the aorta was performed by H&E staining. Oxidative stress and inflammation-related markers were analyzed by ELISA kit and real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: DP (20 mg/kg) decreased serum TG (2.36 ± 0.66 vs. 4.33 ± 0.27 mmol/L for the AS group), TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C (all p < 0.05). DP (20 mg/kg) also reduced lipid levels in the liver and aorta. DP (20 mg/kg) down-regulated the mRNA levels of IL-6, VCAM-1, and NF-κB and up-regulated the mRNA levels of GSH-PX and SOD1. CONCLUSIONS: This study proved that DP alleviated the HFD-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in atherosclerosis rabbits. These results provided the scientific basis for developing novel therapies.",

Glibenclamide, an oral hypoglycaemic drug used in the treatment of DM has associated side effects. Natural products are considered safe in the treatment of chronic diseases. Hibiscus sabdariffa (HS) is a plant that has demonstrated antidiabetic activity. We aimed to determine the potential benefits of co-administration of HS and glibenclamide in ameliorating oxidative stress in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.  A total of 25 male albino Wistar rats were divided randomly into five groups: control (Non-DM), diabetic (DM), diabetic treated with 600µg/kg BW of glibenclamide (DM + GLIB), diabetic treated with 500mg/kg BW of HS (DM + HS), diabetic treated with both 600µg/kg BW of glibenclamide and 500mg/kg BW of HS (DM + GLIB + HS). The interventions were administered for a period of 28 days. The Non-DM rats were significantly heavier (p<0.01) compared to rats in the other treatment groups. Glibenclamide or HS alone and in combination, significantly lowered (p < 0.001) the final fasting blood glucose concentration of the rats in the respective treatment groups. HS and a combination of HS+ GLIB resulted in increased (p<0.05) serum activity of catalase, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase compared to the DM untreated rats.  The serum level of malondialdehyde was significantly lowered (p=0.000) in rats that received a combination of HS + GLIB compared to the DM untreated rats. Coadministration of HS + GLIB showed beneficial regeneration of islet-cells in the pancreas. Co-administration of HS + GLIB appears to be more beneficial in the treatment of DM and associated oxidative stress than when given as single agents. Thus, a case for their incorporation as a combined therapy for DM should be considered.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Hibiscus sabdariffa (hibiscus) has been proposed to affect cardiovascular risk factors. OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence for the effectiveness of hibiscus in modulating cardiovascular disease risk markers, compared with pharmacologic, nutritional, or placebo treatments. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of the Web of Science, Cochrane, Ovid (MEDLINE, Embase, AMED), and Scopus databases identified reports published up to June 2021 on randomized controlled trials using hibiscus as an intervention for lipid profiles, blood pressure (BP), and fasting plasma glucose levels in adult populations. DATA EXTRACTION: Seventeen chronic trials were included. Quantitative data were examined using a random effects meta-analysis and meta-regression with trial sequential analysis to account for type I and type II errors. DATA ANALYSIS: Hibiscus exerted stronger effects on systolic BP (-7.10 mmHg [95%CI, -13.00, -1.20]; I2 = 95%; P = 0.02) than placebo, with the magnitude of reduction greatest in those with elevated BP at baseline. Hibiscus induced reductions to BP similar to that resulting from medication (systolic BP reduction, 2.13 mmHg [95%CI, -2.81, 7.06], I2 = 91%, P = 0.40; diastolic BP reduction, 1.10 mmHg [95%CI, -1.55, 3.74], I2 = 91%, P = 0.42). Hibiscus also significantly lowered levels of low-density lipoprotein compared with other teas and placebo (-6.76 mg/dL [95%CI, -13.45, -0.07]; I2 = 64%; P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Regular consumption of hibiscus could confer reduced cardiovascular disease risk. More studies are warranted to establish an effective dose response and treatment duration.

      "abstract": "We aimed to assess the efficacy of Hibiscus sabdariffa in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension or metabolic syndrome (MetS) by comparing it against placebo, antihypertensive drugs, or other herbal products. Four databases were searched for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) examining the efficacy of H. sabdariffa in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension or hypertension associated with MetS. Data on the change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were extracted and analyzed using Review Manager Version 5.3. A total of 13 RCTs (1205 participants) were analyzed. Hibiscus sabdariffa significantly reduced both SBP and DBP compared with placebo (mean difference -6.67, P = 0.004 and -4.35 mm Hg, P = 0.02). Subgroup analysis showed that change in SBP and DBP was statistically significant in patients with only hypertension, whereas not significant in patients with hypertension associated with MetS. When H. sabdariffa was compared with active controls (antihypertensive drugs or other herbals), the change in SBP and DBP was not statistically significant (all P > 0.05). Hibiscus sabdariffa is effective in reducing the SBP and DBP in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, but was neither effective in those with MetS nor superior to antihypertensive drugs. Further RCTs are required to determine the long-term efficacy of H. sabdariffa and to describe patients who would benefit most from this treatment.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Polyphenols have shown capacity to improve appetite sensation, leading to enhanced control of body weight. However, despite being related with hunger-related hormones, metabolic and mechanism are not well known. METHODS: The effectiveness of a nutraceutical composed of extract to Lippia citriodora and Hibiscus sabdarrifa (Lc-Hs) for controlling satiety and hunger was analyzed in a cross-over, placebo-controlled (Pla) clinical intervention. The study was divided in two 60-day periods separated by 30-day length wash-out period. At the end of each period, overweight and obese subjects (n = 33; age = 33.76 ± 12.23; BMI = 28.20 kg/m2 ± 2.47; fat mass 30.65 ± 8.39%; both sexes were proposed to eat an ad-libitum meal. Meanwhile, appetite sensation was determined by visual analog scales at different times. Moreover, blood extraction was performed to determine biochemical parameters (lipid and glucidic profile and safety parameters) and to evaluate hunger-related hormones (insulin, leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin, GLP-1 and peptide YY). RESULTS: A decrease in appetite sensation was observed in Lc-Hs treatment, showing higher satiety quotient (Pla = 3.36 ± 2.33%mm/kcal; Lc-Hs = 5.53 ± 2.91%mm/kcal; p < 0.0001). Area under the curve was higher in Pla compared to Lc-Hs during the test, from baseline to minute 240 (240 (Pla 9136.65 ± 2261.46% x min-1; Lc-Hs 8279.73 ± 2745.71% x min-1; p < 0.014). Energy consumption was lower for subjects treated with Lc-Hs (774.44 ± 247.77 kcal) compared to those treated with Pla (849.52 ± 246.54 kcal) (p < 0.004). Leptin values varied from baseline (Pla 12.36 ± 1.98 ng/mL; Lc-Hs 13.13 ± 1.99 ng/mL) to the end of the study (Pla 12.60 ± 2.02 ng/mL; Lc-Hs 12.06 ± 2.05 ng/mL; p < 0.047). GLP-1 values varied (p < 0.001) in Lc-Hs treatment from baseline (4.34 ± 0.49 ng/mL) to the end of the study (3.23 ± 0.52 ng/mL). CONCLUSION: The supplementation with the Lc-Hs extract decreases appetite sensation in overweight and obese population, reducing calorie intake after an ad-libitum meal. Due to variation on hunger-related hormones and the relationship between satiety feeling, it would be interesting to develop future research focused on the variation of the hormones themselves.",

      "abstract": "The calyx of roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) has been the focus of attention of several studies, and although earlier studies on this plant showed it to possess antilipidemic and antidiabetic activities, none of these studies have assessed the effects of this plant on the physiological parameters of healthy subjects. The present study determined the effects of roselle calyx beverages on blood pressure, abdominal circumference, body mass index (BMI), hematological and urinary parameters, and the lipid profile of healthy subjects. Healthy subjects (n=30) were treated with a 200 ml roselle calyx beverage each morning and evening for 30 consecutive days. Every week the subjects were asked to perform some physical activity by following the Young Men's Christian Association step test. This study used a pre-post quasi-experimental design. Blood samples were taken before (day-0) and after the intervention (day-30). There was an increase in the levels of high-density lipoproteins (from 47.0 to 49.5 mg/dl; P=0.015), and a significant decrease in both systolic and diastolic (P=0.036 and P=0.030, respectively), and the abdominal circumference of the subjects (P=0.005). However, total cholesterol levels (191.2 to 191.9 mg/dl; P=0.821) and low-density lipoprotein levels (129.8 to 133.5 mg/dl; P=0.249) were slightly increased, although not significantly. A lower level of triglycerides (114.3 to 107.4 mg/dl; P=0.269) and very-low-density lipoprotein levels (22.8 to 21.4 mg/dl; P=0.681) was observed. No significant differences were detected in the BMI or the urinalysis parameters were identified. Based on these results, roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) may be used as a supplement to prospectively improve the health status of subjects. No serious adverse effects were observed during this trial."

METHODS: Hypertension was induced in rats (SBP 173.2 ± 1.7 mmHg, mean, 1-24 h). Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean blood pressure (MBP) and heart rate (HR) of group-I (amlodipine treated), group-II (Z. officinale, and Z. officinale + amlodipine) and group-III (H. sabdariffa, and H. sabdariffa + amlodipine) animals were measured by \"tail-cuff system\". Pharmacokinetics of amlodipine with and without herbs (Z. officinale or H. sabdariffa) was also investigated. RESULTS: Z. officinale as well as H. sabdariffa decreased the SBP, DBP and MBP. Concurrent treatment with Z. officinale + amlodipine (SBP 129.4 ± 4.5) or H. sabdariffa + amlodipine (SBP 130.4 ± 3.9) showed higher decrease in BP (mean, 1-24h), than individually administered amlodipine (SBP 149.5 ± 2.4) or Z. officinale (SBP 150.2 ± 3.1) or H. sabdariffa (SBP 139.1 ± 1.2). These herbs also influenced the Cmax, AUC0-t, and Tmax of amlodipine. H. sabdariffa increased AUC0-t of amlodipine from 81.8 ± 14.7 to 125.0 ± 10.6 (ng h/mL). CONCLUSION: Simultaneous administration of Z. officinale or H. sabdariffa with amlodipine, improves its pharmacodynamic response.",

      "abstract": "Hibiscus sabdariffa. L is folk medicine that is often used for its hypolipidemic and antihypertensive effects; however, the active compound responsible for its anti-obesity effect is presently unknown. Delphinidin-3-sambubioside (Dp3-Sam) is an anthocyanin, was extracted from Hibiscus sabdariffa L. The present research aimed to investigate the role of Dp3-Sam in the prevention of hyperlipidemia in vivo and in vitro. Rats were fed with a standard chow diet (Control group) or high-fat diet (HFD and DP group) for eight weeks. Besides, HepG2 cells were stimulated with 0.2 mM oleic acid, with or without Dp3-Sam (100-200 µg/ml). Lipid profiles were measured by commercial kits. Oil Red O staining was performed to measure the hepatic and intracellular lipid levels. The key genes of lipid metabolism were measured by RT-PCR. In HFD-fed rats, Dp3-Sam reduced the body weight gain, visceral fat, and abdominal fat and decreased hepatic lipid deposits. Dp3-Sam decreased intracellular TG levels and lipid accumulation in oleic acid-treated HepG2 cells. Besides, Dp3-Sam downregulated the mRNA expression of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 c (SREBP-1 C), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and upregulated the mRNA expression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), carnitine palmitoyltransferase1 (CPT1), acyl-coenzyme A oxidase (ACOX), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). Dp3-Sam up-regulated the expression of phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (pAMPK) in HFD-fed rats. Our findings indicated that Dp3-Sam possesses the potential to improve lipid metabolism dysfunction and our results offered evidence for the use of Dp3-Sam as therapy for the prevention of obesity and dyslipidemia.",

The feasibility of using Hibiscus sabdariffa (HS) decoction to curb hypertension was evaluated. A multicentric comparative pilot intervention for 121 participants with high blood pressure (BP) (≥140/90 mmHg) was conducted. Participants of the intervention group (with or without conventional medication) received HS decoction on a dose regimen starting from 10 grams per day. BP was measured five times over six weeks. The major active substances were chemically quantified. Results: After 6 weeks, 61.8% of participants from the intervention group (n = 76) reached the target BP < 140/90 mmHg, compared to 6.7% in the control group (n = 45). In the intervention group, a mean (±SD) reduction of 23.1 (±11.8) mmHg and 12.0 (±11.2) for systolic and diastolic BP, respectively, was observed, while in the control group the reduction was 4.4 (±10.2)/3.6 (±8.7). The chemical analysis of the starting dose indicated a content of 36 mg of total anthocyanins and 2.13 g of hibiscus acid. The study shows the feasibility of using HS decoction in IDP's problematic framework, as hibiscus is a safe, local, affordable, and culturally accepted food product."

After HPLC-ESI-QToF-MS analysis of samples taken at 0, 24, 48 and 72 h of fermentation, it was observed that hydroxycinnamic acids, flavanols, flavonols, and anthocyanins were mainly transformed into derivatives of hydroxyphenylpropionic, hydroxyphenylacetic and hydroxybenzoic acids. Moreover, organic acids, such as hydroxycitric and hibiscus acids, were formed along with unidentified lactones and reduced compounds.

      "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MS) is the association of three or more pathologies among which obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and diabetes are included. It causes oxidative stress (OS) and renal dysfunction. Hibiscus sabdariffa L. (HSL) is a source of natural antioxidants that may control the renal damage caused by the MS. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of a 2% HSL infusion on renal function in a MS rat model induced by the administration of 30% sucrose in drinking water. 24 male Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups: Control rats, MS rats and MS + HSL rats. MS rats had increased body weight, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, insulin, HOMA index, and leptin (p ≤ 0.04). Renal function was impaired by an increase in perfusion pressure in the isolated and perfused kidney, albuminuria (p ≤ 0.03), and by a decrease in clearance of creatinine (p ≤ 0.04). The activity of some antioxidant enzymes including the superoxide dismutase isoforms, peroxidases, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase was decreased (p ≤ 0.05). Lipoperoxidation and carbonylation were increased (p ≤ 0.001). The nitrates/nitrites ratio, total antioxidant capacity, glutathione levels and vitamin C were decreased (p ≤ 0.03). The treatment with 2% HSL reversed these alterations. The results suggest that the treatment with 2% HSL infusion protects renal function through its natural antioxidants which favor an improved renal vascular response. The infusion contributes to the increase in the glomerular filtration rate, by promoting an increase in the enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems leading to a decrease in OS and reestablishing the normal renal function.",

      "abstract": "Hypertension is an important factor of cardiovascular diseases and contributes to their negative consequences including mortality. The World Health Organization estimated that 54% of strokes and 47% of cases of ischemic heart illness are related to high blood pressure. Recently, Hibiscus sabdariffa (HS) and Lippia citriodora (LC) have attracted scientific interest, and they are recognized for their high content of polyphenols as these may prevent several disease factors, such as hypertension. The aim of the present study is to determine if supplementation with an HS-LC blend (MetabolAid®) may be effective for the treatment of type 1 hypertensive sedentary populations. A total of 80 type 1 hypertensive subjects of both sexes were included in the study and were treated with placebo or the HS-LC extract, and both groups were treated over 84 days. The blood pressure (diastolic, systolic, and pulse pressure) was measured throughout the day, for each of the days of the study duration and determined using Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM). Physical activity was determined throughout the study to ensure similar conditions related to exercise. The results showed the capacity for reducing the blood pressure parameters in the case of the HS-LC extract. The daily consumption of the HS-LC extract but not the placebo over 84 days was able to reduce the daytime parameters related to blood pressure. The most remarkable results were observed in the measurements performed during the daytime, especially in the systolic blood pressure showing statistically significant variation.",

In recent years, many studies have investigated the uses and mechanisms of action of Hibiscus sabdariffa to treat common chronic diseases. In this literature review, we place the spotlight on Hibiscus sabdariffa's medical effect on common chronic diseases, the flower commonly used to make hibiscus tea. The databases PubMed, MEDLINE, Clinical Key, and CINAHL were searched for studies related to Hibiscus sabdariffa's compounds, antioxidative and anti-inflammatory features, mechanism of action on common chronic diseases including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. Hibiscus sabdariffa antihypertensive potentials originate from the vasodilator activity, diuretic efficacy, functionality as an ACE inhibitor, adipocyte differentiation inhibitor, heart rate reduction ability, and anti-inflammatory mechanistic. The antihyperlipidemic effect is dose-dependent and stems from the antioxidative effect and the activation of AMPK through phosphorylation and the inhibition of regulatory adipogenic transcription factors PPAR-γ, C/EBP-α, and SREBP-1c, which altogether results in lipid-lowering effect. As an antihyperglycemic, Hibiscus sabdariffa serves as anti-insulin resistance by inhibition of the phosphorylation of IRS-1 beside a similar effect to gliptins. Finally, Hibiscus sabdariffa was proven to protect against neuroinflammation in microglial cell culture exposed to LPS by decreasing IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α expression, and the protective effect against glucotoxicity, improve memory function by inhibiting the formation of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins in the mouse brain. Regular consumption of hibiscus tea or extract is beneficial for a reduction in chronic disease risk and diagnosis.Key teaching pointsHibiscus sabdariffa, or hibiscus, has been used for millennia as both a delicious cultural beverage and an ancient medicinal therapy.

They believe that rosella is effective in controlling metabolic syndrome, working with antihypertension, antidiabetic, antidyslipidemia and antiobesity effects. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of rosella in controlling metabolic syndrome through the secretion of blood nitric oxide (NO) and the cortisol pathway. METHODS: This study was a quasiexperimental, pretest-posttest with control group design. The total subjects were 18 people, women, and the elderly. Subjects were selected randomly into 2 groups: control group (n = 8) and treatment group (n = 8). The treatment was rosella tea, a dose of 2 grams, duration 2 times a day, given in the morning (08.00-8.30 a.m.) and evening (06.30-7.00 p.m.) after meals for 21 days. Examination of NO and cortisol levels was carried out using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in bodyweight (BW) (p = 0.021), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (p = 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (p = 0.049), glucose preprandial (FPG) (p = 0.014), total cholesterol (CT) (p = 0.001), triglycerides (TGs) (p = 0.014), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (p = 0.001), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (p = 0.010) after consuming rosella. NO levels were significantly increased (p = 0.012), whereas cortisol levels decreased significantly (p = 0.008) after therapy with rosella tea in elderly women. CONCLUSION: Rosella has shown evidence to control and lower blood pressure, blood glucose, lipid profile, and cortisol in the elderly with metabolic syndrome. Rosella is a traditional medicine that has the potential to be developed as a therapy for metabolic syndrome patients."

This study assessed the clinical effectiveness of these two plants in the galenic forms of tablet and brew (decoction) in noncomplicated hypertensive patients. In total, 219 hypertensive patients with systolic blood pressure (SBP) between 140 and 180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 90 and 110 mmHg, without cardiovascular or renal complications, were involved in a multicentric randomized clinical trial in Senegal comparing five treatment regimens: bissap tablets (2 × 375 mg/day), bissap brew (10 g of calyx/day), kinkeliba tablets (2 × 200 mg/day), kinkeliba brew (10 g of leaves/day), and captopril (2 × 50 mg/day) as control. During the 6 months' follow-up, a significant and equivalent decrease of SBP was observed with the herbal drug approach (-19.5 ± 16.1 mmHg, p < 0.001) and control group (-19.7 ± 16.7, p < 0.001). Regarding the galenic forms, the brews tended to be slightly more effective than tablets (reduction of SBP: -20.7 ± 15.1 mmHg vs -18.7 ± 16.7). The rates of clinically significant effectiveness (decrease in SBP ≥ 10 mmHg) were 75%, 67%, and 65% with bissap, kinkeliba, and captopril, respectively. After 6 months, target blood pressure of <140/90 mmHg was attained by 49% of patients with bissap, 51% with kinkeliba and 40% with captopril. Bissap and kinkeliba appeared, at doses utilized, to be as effective as captopril over the 6 months' follow-up. In subsequent studies, brews might be started with a lower dosage.",

      "abstract": "Ovarian hypofunction is characterized by decay in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neurotrophin associated with cognitive and memory function. Hormone replacement therapy is the most common treatment to counteract the negative effects of ovarian insufficiency; however, this therapy may increase the odds of endometrial cancer, blood clots, stroke, and breast cancer. Therefore, a safer alternative to synthetic estrogens is needed. One possible candidate may be phytoestrogens. Hibiscus sabdariffa L. (Malvaceae) is a source of natural food colorants; the calyces and leaves of the plant are consumed in drinks and culinary preparations and are recognized for several health benefits related to their high content of anthocyanins. In the present study, we used an ovariectomized rat model to assess the phytoestrogenic effect of H. sabdariffa, and evaluated spatial memory and BDNF expression. Ninety-day-old female Wistar rats were randomly separated into six groups. Rats from four groups were ovariectomized and injected with a physiological dose of estradiol, or given, in drinking water, an extract prepared from calyces of H. sabdariffa at doses of 50 or 100 mg/kg body weight. Both Intact and Sham groups were included as controls. At day 42, short- and long-term memories were assessed by the Barnes maze test, and hippocampal BDNF expression was evaluated by RT-qPCR and Western blot. Ovariectomy significantly decreased memory performance and BDNF expression, compared with controls. However, administration of H. sabdariffa extract reversed the negative effect of ovariectomy on short- and long-term memory parameters and BDNF expression. A stronger effect was observed at a lower dose of the extract. In conclusion, the extract from H. sabdariffa acted as a phytoestrogen in ovariectomized rats, improving spatial memory performance and hippocampal BDNF expression. Based on these promising results, further clinical experimentation is recommended to study the benefits of H. sabdariffa as an alternative hormonal therapy in patients with ovarian hypofunction.",

The results showed that the value of phenolic compounds and anthocyanin compounds were 626.57 mg/g gallic acid and 379.11 µg/ml, respectively, and the extract had high antioxidant activity. Maltodextrin-whey protein concentrate was used for nanoencapsulation of the extract. Then, to investigate the effect of sour tea extract (free and nanoencapsulated forms) with carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) on quality and shelf life of chicken nugget, five treatments, including T1: control, T2: CMC, T3: CMC +1,000 ppm extract, T4: CMC +1,000 ppm nano extract; and T5: CMC +TBHQ, were prepared. First, physicochemical properties of nugget were measured. The results showed that CMC and sour tea extract reduced oil uptake, moisture content, frying percentage, frying efficiency, and soft texture of fried chicken nugget, and overall the best results were observed in CMC treatment with both extract and nano-extract (p < .05). Then, peroxide value (PV), total volatile nitrogen base (TVB-N), thiobarbituric acid (TBA), and sensory indexes were evaluated in treatments stored at refrigerator for 9 days. The results showed that sour tea extract has antioxidant properties and coating of extract increased its antioxidant properties as nugget containing 1,000 ppm the nanoencapsulated sour tea extract with CMC delayed oxidative spoilage and organoleptic changes of chicken nugget (p < .05). Therefore, it seems that the nanoencapsulated sour tea extract with CMC can be used as a natural preservative in meat and meat products."

The main ingredients of AqualiefTM are carnosine and dried calyces of Hibiscus sabdariffa L.

In a Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind Trial, sixty patients with xerostomia (RTOG/EORTC grade 1-2) were randomly assigned to receive either placebo, or AqualiefTM tablets (three times/day after meals) for 6 consecutive days. A questionnaire was used to evaluate dry mouth symptoms before and after 6 days of AqualiefTM or placebo application. Unstimulated and stimulated salivary flow rates and pH were measured before and after application. Treatment with AqualiefTM for 6 days induced a significant increase in saliva pH from 6.2 ± 0.5 to 6.4 ± 0.6 (P < 0.05) while placebo was ineffective (from 6.2 ± 0.5 to 6.3 ± 0.5). AqualiefTM also induced a significant increase in the pH of stimulated saliva from 6.3 ± 0.5 to 6.6 ± 0.5 (P < 0.01). Placebo was ineffective also in this setting (from 6.2 ± 0.5 to 6.3 ± 0.5). Besides an expected normalization of the saliva pH value, AqualiefTM treatment for 6 days greatly increased (56%, P < 0.0001) saliva production. Placebo induced a 19% increase (P < 0.05), which was likely due to mechanical stimulation. AqualiefTM also increased stimulated saliva production (27% increase with respect to day 0, P < 0.05), while placebo was ineffective. AqualiefTM was effective in regulating the saliva pH, in increasing saliva production and improving dry mouth symptoms in xerostomic patients.",

We review the literature and suggest a rational explanation for divergent findings. When used without oxidation and mordanting, roselle is an indiscriminate oversight stain. With appropriate oxidation and mordanting, roselle can be an effective nuclear stain. We propose here use of a stain that is formulated rationally and followed by treatment in a differentiating solution that also acts as a counterstain. We also offer suggestions for improving roselle for the general scientific community.",

Pre-harvest spray treatment (AGSC) was compared with postharvest dip coating (AGDC) using Aloe vera gel (AG) for the first time in microgreens for postharvest quality improvement. PET-CS had a lower physiological loss in weight (PLW), respiration rate (RR), electrolyte leakage (EL), microbial counts (MCs), and higher overall acceptability (OA) than LDPE-SSB. AG-coated microgreens had significantly (p ≤ 0.05) lesser deteriorative postharvest changes and higher ascorbic acid content than uncoated control. AGSC maintained better OA and postharvest quality than AGDC, especially at the end of the study period in terms of reducing EL, retaining greenness (-a*), and chroma value in HbS microgreens. In RaS microgreens, AGSC helped to maintain lower PLW, MC, and higher ascorbic acid levels. AGSC could be suggested as an eco-friendly ergonomic pre-harvest treatment along with PET-CS for enhancement of postharvest quality and shelf life in RaS and HbS microgreens, with a tremendous potential to be extended to other microgreens."

The plant contains a high quantity of polyphenolic compounds and at least two of them were proven to induce potent anticancer effects. Although, the molecular mechanism underlying the anticancer activity was roughly estimated in several studies. The present review aimed to assemble all ambiguous information to report the molecular evidence establishing the potent anticancer activity of Hibiscus sabdariffa and its implication for cancer therapy. This study suggests that Hibiscus sabdariffa is an ideal candidate to investigate its role as a herbal supplement for cancer prevention and treatment. With excellent safety and tolerability record, polyphenolic compounds from the plant need better designed clinical trials.",

Methods This study was conducted in two phases. For the first phase, five DSS-induced colitis mice were sacrificed (group 1) and compared with six healthy mice (group 2) after five-cycle induction (70 days). For the second phase, roselle-treated DSS-induced colitis mice were sacrificed on day 7, 14, 21, and 28 after induction and compared with mesalazine-treated DSS-induced colitis mice. Expressions of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10 were determined by immunohistochemistry and HCIS were assessed by two experienced pathologists. Results The expressions of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10, and HCIS in DSS-induced colitis mice were increased compared with control. The expressions of IL-6, TNF-α were significantly higher in roselle-treated group on day 7 and 14, but not on day 21 and 28, whereas, the expression of IL-10 was significantly lower only on day 7 compared with mesalazine-treated group. The inflammation was higher in roselle-treated group assessed by using HCIS. Compared to day 0, the reduction of HCIS was significant in roselle-treated and mesalazine-treated groups. Conclusion Roselle flower petal can attenuate the inflammation in DSS-induced colitis in mice. The extract of roselle can be given as an adjuvant therapy to the first-line therapy to enhance anti-inflammatory effect by increasing expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines and decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of losartan were evaluated without and with herbal treatment in hypertensive rats.Treatment of hypertensive rats with investigated herbs substantially reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of rats. Treatment of rats (n = 5) with L-NAME plus H. sabdariffa plus losartan and L-NAME plus Z. officinale plus losartan reduced SBP by 16.20% and 14.88% and DBP by 14.82% and 17.52% respectively after 12 h, as compared to L-NAME alone treated rats. In a pharmacokinetic study, the Cmax and AUC0-t of losartan in L-NAME plus H. sabdariffa plus losartan and L-NAME plus Z. officinale plus losartan treated rats was increased by 0.7, 1.99 and 1.51, 3.00 fold respectively in comparison to the Cmax and AUC0-t obtained for L-NAME plus losartan treated group. In conclusion, both the investigated herbs significantly increased the antihypertensive effect and plasma concentration of losartan in L-NAME induced hypertensive rats. The current study predicted that the herb-drug interaction between H. sabdariffa-losartan and Z. officinale-losartan could occur; hence these results in rats may warrant further studies in humans, either in humans or in in vitro human liver microsomes.",

Treatments with aqueous extracts showed the highest concentration of total soluble polyphenols (TSP) 32.12-21.23 mg equivalent gallic acid (EAG)/g dry weight (DW), and antioxidant capacity (AOX) in the 2,2-azinobis-3-ethylbenzotiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) assay. The best treatment for TSP and AOX was T4: 2.5% Hibiscus w/w, aqueous extract, decoction, extract-to-carrier ratio 1:1 (w/w), proportion to carriers (MD:GA) 80:20 (w/w), 10,000 rpm, 150 °C. The Taguchi L8 design is a tool that allows the use of multiple variables with a low number of treatments that indicate the drying conditions that give the best parameters, focusing mainly on TSP and AOX, also, it is a good alternative for the preservation and stability of the phenolic compoudns in Hibiscus."

Recently, polyphenols have attracted the attention of the scientific community because of their potential use for the reduction of obesity. A proprietary formula comprised of a blend of Lippia citriodora and Hibiscus sabdariffa has been recognized for its high content of polyphenols, powerful antioxidant molecules that may prevent weight gain and could be helpful for the treatment of obesity, as proven previously by in vivo models. The aim of the present study is to determine if the supplementation with Lippia citriodora and Hibiscus sabdariffa is useful for the treatment of obesity and/or weight control in subjects without a controlled diet. The intake of the extract for 84 days reduced body weight, the body mass index, and the fat mass measured with both bioimpedance and densitometry. This decrease in fat mass was observed to a greater extent, being significant, in the fat mass of the trunk (chest and torso)."

Phenolic extracts from Hibiscus sabdariffa have shown beneficial effects on obesity and its related complications. However, their effects on gut microbiota have not been investigated yet. This study evaluates the effects of a chemically characterized polyphenolic extract of H. sabdariffa (HSE) in an experimental model of diet-induced obesity (DIO) in mice. HSE was administered daily by oral gave for 42 days. HSE reduced weight increase in high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, and improved glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and normalized LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio. It also enhanced the inflammatory state in the liver, reducing the expression of different adipokines and proinflammatory mediators, and reinforced gut integrity by increasing the expression of mucins and proteins involved in the maintenance of mucosal barrier. Moreover, HSE had a prebiotic effect, ameliorating the changes in the gut microbiota induced by the HFD. Thus, HSE improved the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, which may contribute to the beneficial effects. Consequently, HSE could be considered for the development of a complementary treatment for the metabolic syndrome due to its beneficial properties.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) hormone is an incretin hormone that is secreted in the ileum and plays a role in the pancreas to increase insulin secretion, stimulate proliferation, and prevent pancreatic β-cell apoptosis. Currently, diabetes mellitus (DM) treatment based on GLP-1 work is being developed, for instance, from herbal plants such as Hibiscus sabdariffa Linn (H. sabdariffa). Therefore, this study aims to determine the potential of H. sabdariffa in GLP-1 secretion in the ileum and its action in pancreatic β-cells. In addition, this study also aims to determine the active ingredients of H. sabdariffa (Hib) that interact with sodium-glucose cotransporter-1 (SGLT-1) so that it can increase GLP-1 secretion in the ileum and interact with GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1R) in the pancreas. METHOD: This experimental study used 24 experimental animals of Sprague-Dawley type (aged 8-10 weeks, weight 200-250 g) that were divided into 6 groups, namely, (i) normal (C), (ii) normal-Hib 200 (C-Hib200), (iii) normal-Hib 500 (C-Hib500), (iv) DM (C-DM), (v) DM-Hib200, and (vi) DM-Hib500. H. sabdariffa extract was given orally once a day for 5 weeks. Testing of GLP-1 levels in the ileum and pancreatic tissue was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The prediction of the interaction mechanism of the active substance H. sabdariffa against GLP-1 was done using molecular docking. RESULTS: There was a decrease in GLP-1 levels in the ileum of DM rats (p < 0.05). However, DM rats administered H. sabdariffa 500 mg/kg BW had GLP-1 levels that were the same as in normal rats (p > 0.05). This is due to active ingredients such as leucosin, which binds to SGLT-1. Administration of 500 mg/kg BW H. sabdariffa in DM rats resulted in GLP-1 levels in the pancreas that were the same as in normal rats (p > 0.05). In addition, the active ingredient of H. sabdariffa, delphinidin, binds to GLPR in the pancreas. CONCLUSION: The active ingredient of H. sabdariffa can increase GLP-1 secretion in the ileum and can interact with G protein-linked receptors in the pancreas.",

      "abstract": "Influenza A virus (IAV) infection is perennially one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Effective therapy and vaccination are needed to control viral expansion. However, current anti-IAV drugs risk inducing drug-resistant virus emergence. Although intranasal administration of whole inactivated virus vaccine can induce efficient protective immunity, formalin and β-propiolactone are the currently used and harmful inactivating agents. Here, we analyzed the antiviral activity of hibiscus (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) tea extract against human IAV and evaluated its potential as a novel anti-IAV drug and a safe inactivating agent for whole inactivated vaccine. The in vitro study revealed that the pH of hibiscus tea extract is acidic, and its rapid and potent antiviral activity relied largely on the acidic pH. Furthermore, the mouse study showed that the acidic extract was not effective for either therapeutic or vaccination purposes. However, hibiscus tea extract and protocatechuic acid, one of the major components of the extract, showed not only potent acid-dependent antiviral activity but also weak low-pH-independent activity. The low-pH-independent activity did not affect the conformation of immunodominant hemagglutinin protein. Although this low-pH-independent activity is very limited, it may be suitable for the application to medication and vaccination because this activity is not affected by the neutral blood environment and does not lose antigenicity of hemagglutinin. Further study of the low-pH-independent antiviral mechanism and attempts to enhance the antiviral activity may establish a novel anti-IAV therapy and vaccination strategy.",

Design: A multicentric pilot clinical study. Location: Outside a refugee camp in Jordan. Subjects: Thirty-eight participants with blood pressure (BP) above 140/90 mmHg consumed H. sabdariffa tea. Intervention: Consumption of karkade tea containing 10 g of HS/0.5 L daily. This dosage was increased to 15 g of HS/1 L and to 20 g of HS/1 L during the second and third weeks, respectively, if their BP was still high. Outcome measurements: The primary outcome measurement was blood measurement taken once a week. Secondary outcome measurements were satisfaction, possible side effects, and interactions with other medications. Results: Of the 38 participants, 29 finished the program, 72% of whom were taking antihypertensive medication due to uncontrolled hypertension and 28% of whom were not. H. sabdariffa was generally well tolerated: 38% of participants reached the target BP at the end of the study and 65% saw their systolic BP decrease by at least 10 mmHg. Conclusion: H. sabdariffa (karkade) is generally well tolerated and seems to be helpful in treating uncontrolled hypertension, with or without medication.",

However, some studies have shown that coadministration with a conventional antihypertensive drug can affect drug potency. We compared the effects of HS plus captopril (CAP) coadministration to HS and CAP administration alone on blood pressure and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) biomarkers in the rat two-kidney-one-clip (2K1C) model of hypertension. Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into seven groups (n=6/group), a normal control (SHAM) group, and six 2K1C groups. In 2K1C animals, hypertension was induced using a stainless microclip (inner diameter of 0.20 mm). Four weeks after 2K1C surgery, blood pressure was significantly higher than in the SHAM group. Then, model rats were randomly divided into negative control (2K1C, no treatment), positive control (4.5 mg captopril/200 g body weight [BW] orally [p.o.]), HS alone (30 mg/200 g BW; p.o.), and 3 co-treatment groups receiving HS (15, 30, or 60 mg/200 g BW; p.o.) plus 4.5 mg/200 g BW captopril. The treatments were performed for two weeks. Blood pressure was significantly reduced by all the drug treatments to near the level of SHAM controls. Plasma renin level, serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity, and plasma angiotensin II level were also significantly elevated in the 2K1C group compared to the SHAM group. Both serum ACE activity and plasma angiotensin II level were significantly reduced to near SHAM group levels by all the drug treatments. Hibiscus sabdariffa aqueous extract alone can reduce blood pressure. This extract appears could be used as a supplement with captopril but may not provide any additional benefit."

The bioguided fractionation of the crude ethanolic extract allowed the identification of HsFC as the most effective extract. We assessed cell viability (MTT and Tripan blue test), cell migration (Boyden chamber assay), and neurotoxicity (DRG neurotoxicity assay). The promising results prompted us to further fractionate HsFC and we obtained two molecules effective against RPMI-8226 cells without neurotoxic effects at their active concentrations.

      "abstract": "The by-products of Hibiscus sabdariffa L. (HsL), obtained after soaking or decoction of the calyces of Colima and Sudan cultivars, were used for pectin extraction. After soaking, the wastes of both cultivars gave higher yields of pectin than those obtained by decoction. The pectin of the wastes by soaking presented high methoxyl groups, galacturonic acid content, viscosity and gelling capacity. Pectin of this treatment also exhibited bands in the regions of 1750 cm-1 and 1630 cm-1 that represents the C=O stretching vibrations of methyl ester and the amounts and degree of esterification of the HsL pectin. Interestingly, the pectin retained the typical red color of fresh HsL calyces. The amounts of anthocyanins and ascorbic acid of pectin did not show effects against pathogenic microorganisms. Nonetheless, pectin of the Sudan HsL wastes obtained by soaking, exhibited higher properties than those of the citric pectin, thus, demonstrating its potential for industrial applications."

      "abstract": "This study evaluated the antidiabetic potentials of flavonoid-rich aqueous fraction of methanolic extract of Hibiscus sabdariffa calyx (HSCE) on the pancreatic β-cells of experimental type I diabetic model rats. Type 1 diabetes mellitus was induced in Wistar rats by a single intraperitoneal injection of 80mg/kg b/w streptozotocin (STZ) dissolved in 0.1M citrate buffer (pH 6.3). The rats were divided into five groups (n=12) including normal control group, test group I, diabetic negative control, test group II, and diabetic positive control. The test groups received 1.75g/kg b/w of HSCE by gavage for 15 days. Animals were sacrificed; the splenic portion of their pancreas and serum were evaluated for histopathological and biochemical parameters respectively. The regenerative effects of the extract on STZ-diabetes β-cells damage was evident from the results of the histopathological analysis and the biochemical parameters evaluated in the serum. Reduced levels of glutathione, catalase and superoxide dismutase in the serum of diabetic rats were significantly improved in the H. sabdariffa-treated rats (P<0.05). Histological examination of pancreatic islet sections revealed degenerative and necrotic changes (D) in the pancreatic islet of Langerhans, β-cell degranulation, pyknotic β-cell nuclei, decreased islet cellular density, and severe vacuolation (V) in the islet of STZ-diabetic negative control group. The morphology of the pancreas of HSCE-treated diabetic rats (test group II) revealed remarkable improvements in the islet of Langerhans. Stereological studies also revealed that HSCE-treatment remarkably improved volume of the pancreatic islets and the numerical density of β-cell (number of β-cells per unit area of islet) depleted by STZ diabetes. The study concluded that possible antidiabetic mechanism of Hibiscus sabdariffa in STZ diabetes is through induction of β-cell regeneration and its strong antioxidant potential.",

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) constitute one of the most prevalent health problems worldwide, being strongly associated with metabolic syndrome (MS). Oxidative stress (OS) is present in both CVD and MS. Infusions of Hibiscus sabdariffa Linnaeus (HSL) have antioxidant properties and could therefore decrease the presence of OS in these diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate myocardial protection during ischemia/reperfusion due to the antioxidant effect of HSL infusion (3%) on a MS rat model induced by the administration of 30% sucrose in drinking water. We determined in control, MS, and MS + HSL rat hearts (n = 6 per group) cardiac mechanical performance (CMP), coronary vascular resistance (CVR), and activities of manganese and copper/zinc superoxide dismutases (Mn and Cu/Zn-SOD), peroxidases, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), glutathione s-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione (GSH). We also determined lipoperoxidation (LPO), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and the nitrate/nitrite ratio (NO3 -/NO2 -). The treatment with the HSL infusion restored the CMP (p = 0.01) and CVR (p = 0.04) and increased the Mn- (p = 0.02), Cu/Zn-SOD (p = 0.05), peroxidases (p = 0.04), GST (p = 0.02) activity, GHS (p = 0.02), TAC (p = 0.04), and NO3 -/NO2 - (p = 0.01) and decreased the LPO (p = 0.02) in the heart of MS rats undergoing ischemia/reperfusion. The results suggest that the treatment with an infusion from HSL calices protects the cardiac function from damage by ischemia and reperfusion through the antioxidant activities of the substances it possesses. It favors antioxidant enzymatic activities and nonenzymatic antioxidant capacity.",

This study investigated the acute impact of HSC extract consumption on blood pressure (BP), vascular function and other cardiometabolic risk markers. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Twenty-five men with 1% to 10% cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk (determined by QRISK®2) were randomised to consume either 250 mL of the aqueous extract of HSC or water with breakfast in a randomised, controlled, single-blinded, 2-meal cross-over study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NTC02165553) with a two weeks washout period between study days. BP was measured at baseline and hourly for 4 h. Flow mediated dilatation (FMD) of the branchial artery was measured at baseline, 2 and 4 h post intervention drink consumption. RESULTS: Acute consumption of aqueous extract of HSC caused a significant increase in % FMD (p < 0.001), a non-significant decrease in systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP); non-significant increase in urinary and plasma nitric oxide (NOx) and reduced response of serum glucose, plasma insulin, serum triacylglycerol and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels; significant (p = 0.026) improvement in the area under systemic antioxidant response curve (0 to 2 h); no significant changes in arterial stiffness following the acute consumption of the extract of HSC. Gallic acid, 4-O-methylgallic acid, 3-O-methylgallic acid and hippuric acid reached a maximum plasma concentration at 1 to 2 h post consumption of the extract of HSC. CONCLUSION: The extract of HSC improved postprandial vascular function and may be a useful dietary strategy to reduce endothelial dysfunction and CVD risk, although this requires confirmation.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Hibiscus sabdariffa L. is commonly used as an ingredient for herbal teas and food supplements. Several studies demonstrated the beneficial effects of Hibiscus sabdariffa L. extracts (HSE); however, the bioactive components and their mode of action still remain unclear. Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) was used to study health-related effects and the underlying molecular mechanisms of HSE in this model organism as well as effects of hydroxycitric acid (HCA), a main compound of HSE, and its structural analogue isocitric acid (ICA). METHODS: Survival and locomotion were detected by touch-provoked movement. Thermotolerance was analysed using the nucleic acid stain SYTOX green, and intracellular ROS accumulation was measured via oxidation of H2DCF. Localisation of the transcription factors DAF-16 and SKN-1 was analysed in transgenic strains (DAF-16::GFP, SKN-1::GFP). The involvement of DAF-16 and SKN-1 was further investigated using loss-of-function strains as well as gene silencing by feeding RNAi-inducing bacteria. Protection against amyloid-β toxicity was analysed using a transgenic strain with an inducible expression of human amyloid-β peptides in body wall muscle cells (paralysis assay). RESULTS: HSE treatment resulted in a prominent extension of lifespan (up to 24%) and a reduction of the age-dependent decline in locomotion. HCA, a main compound of HSE increased lifespan too, but to a lesser extent (6%) while ICA was not effective. HSE and HCA did not modulate resistance against thermal stress conditions and did not exert antioxidative effects: HSE rather increased intracellular ROS levels, suggesting a pro-oxidative effect of the extract in vivo. HSE and HCA increased the nuclear localisation of the pivotal transcription factors DAF-16 and SKN-1 indicating an activation of these factors. Consistent with this result, lifespan prolongation by HSE was dependent on both transcription factors. In addition to the positive effect on lifespan, HSE treatment also elicited a (strong) protection against amyloid-ß induced toxicity in C. elegans in a DAF-16- and SKN-1-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that HSE increases lifespan and protects against amyloid-β toxicity in the model organism C. elegans. These effects were mediated, at least in parts via modulation of pathways leading to activation/nuclear localisation of DAF-16 and SKN-1. Since HCA, a main component of HSE causes only minor effects, additional bioactive compounds like flavonoids or anthocyanins as well as synergistic effects of these compounds should be investigated.",

Its prevalence has become an economic burden to the health care system and the world at large. One of the alternatives to tackling obesity involves the use of bioactive compounds. We critically examined the effects of Hibiscus sabdariffa extract (HSE) on various parameters associated with the development of obesity such as; the effect of HSE on body weight, the effect of HSE on lipid accumulation, cholesterol metabolism and plasma parameters, the inhibitory effect of HSE on pancreatic lipase, and the effect of HSE on adipocyte differentiation/adipogenesis. This review has gathered reports on the various anti-obesity effects of H. sabdariffa bioactive compounds in cell and animal models, as well as in humans. Available toxicology information on the consumption of H. sabdariffa revealed that its toxicity is dose-dependent and may cause an adverse effect when administered over a long period of time. Reports have shown that H. sabdariffa derived bioactive compounds are potent in the treatment of obesity with an evident reduction in body weight, inhibition of lipid accumulation and suppression of adipogenesis through the PPARγ pathway and other transcriptional factors.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND AIM: The urodynamic study is an invasive examination that allows a thorough evaluation of the functional activity of the lower urinary tract (bladder, urethra). The execution of urodynamic study exposes the patient to the risk of contracting infections of the lower urinary tract. Prevention of urinary tract infections consists in the avoidance of risk factors and prophylaxis with antimicrobial and non-antimicrobial measures. In this article, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a phytotherapeutic product composed of D-mannose, Hibiscus sabdariffa, and Lactobacillus plantarum in the prevention of infectious events following invasive urodynamic examination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected 100 female consecutive patients (age 19-87 years) that underwent urodynamic invasive procedure. We prescribed 14-day therapy with D-mannose, H. sabdariffa, and L. plantarum to these 100 patients after urodynamic invasive test. After that, we have examined urine cultures and urinary symptoms through telephone interviews and hospital outpatient visits to evaluate the possible presence of urinary tract infections. RESULTS: Urinary tract infections were observed through urine culture in 13% of the selected patients; of the 13 urinary tract infections, 9 were observed in patients with urinary tract recurrent infections in the last year and the other 4 cases were associated with patients with no urinary infection in the last year. Three women reported some urinary symptoms and underwent antibiotic therapy. The other 10 cases were classified as asymptomatic bacteriuria. Three cases were related to patients presenting with pelvic organ prolapse. Eight cases were instead related to significant post-voiding residue (>100). Six patients with urinary tract infection reported constipation in the last year. All patients completed the prescribed therapy due to the affordable price of the product and no side effects have been reported. CONCLUSION: Our study about the administration of D-mannose, H. sabdariffa, and L. plantarum after invasive urodynamic examination underlined how this phytotherapeutic product can reduce the risk of bacteriuria and urinary tract infection in women.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized phase III clinical trial, adult females with uncomplicated UTI were enrolled into one of the following treatment groups: Group A: phytotherapic combination 1 tablet in the morning and 1 tablet in the evening for 7 days; Group B: Short term antibiotic treatment according to international guidelines recommendations. At baseline, all patients were evaluated by a urologist and quality of life (QoL) questionnaires and mid-stream urine culture. Same clinical and laboratory investigations were repeated at each follow-up visit. RESULTS: Forty-six patients were enrolled in Group A and 47 in Group B. At the first follow-up (30 days), both groups showed a statistically significant improvement in quality of life scores as compared with baseline assessment [Group A: (QoL 94.3 VS 98.5 p < 0.001); Group B: (QoL 94.5 VS 98.7 p < 0.001)]. An improvement from baseline was also seen at the second followup evaluation after 3 months [Group A: (QoL 94.3 VS 99.1 p < 0.001); Group B: (QoL 94.5 VS 98.1 p < 0.001)]. At the second follow-up visit, a statistically significant difference in QoL was reported between the two groups (99.1 VS 98.1; p < 0.003) and a transition from UTI to asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU) was observed 12 of 46 (26%) patients in Group A, while no patients in Group B demonstrated ABU (p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Here, we demonstrated that this phytotherapic combination is able, in comparison to antibiotic treatment, to improve patients quality of life, reducing symptoms in acute setting and preventing the recurrences. Interestingly, a significantly higher proportion of patients in the phytotherapy group had ABU after three months. Our findings are of great interest in an antibiotic stewardship perspective.",

The expression of catalase gene was observed using RT-PCR. The results showed that treatment of rosella extract increases the activity of catalase, significantly (P<0.05). The increasing of catalase activity was found in dose dependent manner. The catalase gene expression was also found to increase in rosella extract treated groups. The histopathological observation of liver organ was found normal. Rosella extract increase the catalase activity and expression of catalase antioxidant gene. It was concluded that rosella extract increase activity and gene expression of catalase in vivo.",

An encapsulation yield (EY) of 208 μg/100 mg of cells and an encapsulation efficiency (EE) of 27%, were reached after optimisation of the ratios (0.5 g wet yeast cells for 5 ml of anthocyanin extracts at 1 g·L-1) and with 10% of ethanol. The storage stability of encapsulated pigments was investigated in water and buffer pH 1.5 at 5 & 37 °C for 10 days and 90 °C for 30 min. The percentage of loss of colour was determined by colourimetry assays. The microparticles made of yeast with or without heat treatment exhibited different protecting effects (P < 0.01). At 37 °C, the percentage of loss of colour in water was of 2.5% for heat-treated and 36.5% for non-treated yeast microparticles, suggesting that yeast enzymes would be responsible for the loss of anthocyanin during storage. These results are confirmed by the percentage of loss of colour which was far lower in conditions of low enzymatic activity: 3.1% at 5 °C for non-heat-treated cells in water. The pH of solvent had also an important effect on the degradation of encapsulated anthocyanin; in buffer at pH 1.5 and 37 °C with the non-heat-treated cells, the degradation decreased strongly to 9.4% compared with 36.5% in water. These results show that yeast cells are a good mean of encapsulation of pigments for a colouring purpose and that they provide anthocyanins a good protection as long as their enzymes are inactivated.",

Therefore, the effects of time and extraction temperature on the bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity of Hibiscus sabdariffa calyx were evaluated. In addition, the effects of copigmentation and pH on the stability of anthocyanins were assessed and the cytotoxic effects (LC50, IC50, and GC50) of the extracts were determined in relation to tumor cell lines - Caco-2, HepG-2, HCT8, and A549. The temperature significantly influenced the total anthocyanins and flavonoids contents. The interaction between time/temperature influenced the total phenolic content and ascorbic acid. The t1/2 and the percentage of colour retention decreased markedly at temperatures above 80 °C. Variations in pH conserved the antioxidant activity of the anthocyanins, and the protonation-deprotonation process of the extract was reversible. The treatment of cells with purified anthocyanin extract or crude extracts at 5-800 μg mL-1 did not show significant cytotoxic effects on the cell lines, corroborating the chemical antioxidant effect of the extracts (DPPH assay). Cyanidin-3-glucoside, delphinidin-3-sambubioside, delphinidin-3-glucoside, and cyanidin-3-sambubioside were identified in the extracts by LC-ESI-MS.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Dyslipidemia has been considered as a major risk factor for coronary heart disease. Alternative medicine has a significant role in treatment of dyslipidemia. There are controversial findings regarding the effects of sour tea on dyslipidemia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of aqueous extract of dried calyx of sour tea on polygenic dyslipidemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This clinical trial was done on 43 adults (30-60 years old) with polygenic dyslipidemia that were randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups. The control group was trained in lifestyle modifications at baseline. The intervention group was trained for lifestyle modifications at baseline and received two cups of sour tea daily, and both groups were followed up for 12 weeks. Lipid profile was evaluated at baseline, and six and 12 weeks following the intervention. In addition, dietary and physical activity assessed at baseline for twelve weeks. RESULTS: Mean concentration of total cholesterol, HDL-C and LDL-C significantly decreased by up to 9.46%, 8.33%, and 9.80%, respectively, after 12 weeks in the intervention group in comparison to their baseline values. However, LDL-C/HDL-C ratio significantly increased by up to 3.15%, following 12 weeks in the control group in comparison to their baseline values. This study showed no difference in lipid profiles between the two groups, except for HDL-C concentrations. CONCLUSION: sour tea may have significant positive effects on lipid profile of polygenic dyslipidemia subjects and these effect might be attributed to its anthocyanins and inflation factor content. Therefore, sour tea intake with recommended dietary patterns and physical activity can be useful in regulation of lipid profile in patients with polygenic dyslipidemia."

Sorrel extract inhibited AChE (EC50 = 46.96 µg/mL), BChE (EC50 = 40.38 µg/mL), MAO (EC50 = 43.69 µg/mL), and E-NTDase (EC50 = 40.52 µg/mL) and stimulated Na+/K+-ATPase (EC50 = 22.01 µg/mL) activities. The phenolic extract also reduced Fe2+- (EC50 = 22.37 µg/mL) and sodium nitroprusside- (SNP-) (21.46 µg/mL) induced malondialdehyde (MDA) production in rat brain homogenates. Catechin (53.12 mg/g), chlorogenic (67.12 mg/g), rutin (16.25 mg/g), and caffeic acid (15.38 mg/g) were the most abundant phenolic compounds in the extract. The synergistic effects of the phenolic compounds may contribute to the enzyme inhibitory and stimulatory activities of the extract.

A prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted to assess efficacy of Combretum micranthum (kinkeliba) and Hibiscus sabdariffa (bissap), in the galenic form of capsules of plant powder, on blood pressure in adult patients with non-complicated hypertension ( > 140/90 mm Hg). One hundred and twenty five patients were randomly allocated into group 1 (kinkeliba leaves 190 mg × 2/day), or group 2 (bissap calyx 320 mg × 2/day), or group 3 (ramipril 5 mg /day) during four consecutive weeks. Blood and urinary samples were collected on day 0 and 28 while patients' blood pressure was measured weekly. In all three groups SBP and DBP decreased over 3 weeks of treatment (P < 0.001). For SBP, mean decrease was higher with ramipril (-16.7 ± 8.4 mm Hg) than with kinkeliba (-12.2 ± 6.6 mm Hg, P = 0.016) and bissap (-11.2 ± 3.3 mm Hg, P = 0.001). For DBP, mean decrease with ramipril (-6.7 ± 3.6 mm Hg) was more important than with kinkeliba (-5.0 ± 3.0 mm Hg, P = 0.011) but not statistically different to bissap group (-6.0 ± 4.7 mm Hg, P = 0.271). A significant natriuretic effect was observed in the kinkeliba and bissap groups but not in patients under ramipril treatment. At the end of the four weeks, 39% [95% CI: 25.7-54.3] of patients in the ramipril group, 37% [95% CI: 23.6-51.9] of patients in the kinkeliba group and 21% [95% CI: 11.7-35.9] of those taking bissap had normalized their BP.",

Group 1 served as control was given tapwater; Group 2: 500 mg/kg daily of Hibiscus sabdariffa L. extract (HSE); Group 3: bilateral common carotid artery occlusion(BCCAO) for 30 minutes followed by reperfusion for 24 hours; Group 4: 500 mg/kg (HSE) before BCCAO; Group 5: 500mg/kg vitamin E before BCCAO. All administrations were oral and lasted 3 weeks. Behavioural studies namely: transitions,rearings, groomings and forelimb grip strength were carried out. Rats were thereafter euthanized and biochemical[malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT)], histological andmorphological investigations were carried out on rat whole brain. Animals pretreated with HSE showed a significant (p<0.05)reduction in their body weight compared to the control group. BCCAO produced a significant (p<0.05) reduction in GSH,SOD and CAT while elevating MDA non-significantly. The HSE and Vitamin E pretreatment ameliorated these biochemicalalterations and also attenuated reactive changes in cortical neurons. BCCAO treatment increased grooming and forelimbstrength which both HSE and vitamin E pretreatment reversed.

Anti-urease activity was evaluated by an Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS) based method, while cytotoxicity was assayed by the MTT method. PCA exerted notable anti-JBU activity compared with that of acetohydroxamic acid (AHA), with IC50 values of 1.7 and 3.2 µM, respectively. PCA did not show any significant cytotoxic effect on (GES-1) cells at concentrations ranging from 1.12 to 3.12 µM. Molecular docking study revealed high spontaneous binding ability of PCA to the active site of urease. Additionally, the anti-urease activity was found to be related to the presence of hydroxyl moieties of PCA. This study presents PCA as a natural urease inhibitor, which could be used safely in the treatment of diseases caused by urease-producing bacteria.",

But its clinical application is limited, because DOX induces apoptosis in cardiomyocytes and it leads to permanent degenerative cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Recent trainings showed that Hibiscus sabdariffa exhibit pharmacological actions such as potent antioxidant. So, in this study we explored the protective effect of H. sabdariffa extract on doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity in H9c2 cells. Cell viability was quantified by MTT assay. Apoptotic cells were determined using PI staining of DNA fragmentation by flowcytometry (sub-G1 peak). Cells were cultured with 5 μM DOX for 24 h to create the cell damage. H9c2 cells were pretreated with different concentrations (7.81-500 μg/mL) of H. sabdariffa extract (HSE) for 2 h before DOX treatment in all trials. Pretreatment with HSE increased cell viability at concentration of 31.25-500 μg/mL. Compared to control cells, apoptosis was induced in DOX treated cells after 24 h, (𝑃< 0.001). Pretreatment with HSE significantly decreased cell apoptosis after 24 hr at concentration of 31.25-250 μg/mL. Our results show that H. sabdariffa could exert the cardioprotective effects on DOX-induced toxicity partly by antiapoptotic activity."

A recent survey reported that some participants co-administered Hibiscus sabdariffa, a widely used beverage, or tea, with their antihyperlipidaemic medications. This study therefore evaluated the effect of concomitant administration of Hibiscus sabdariffa calyces' extracts with simvastatin on hyperlipidaemia and pharmacokinetics of the drug in vivo. METHODS: Factorial experimental designs were used to evaluate the comparative effectiveness and interactions between simvastatin and aqueous extract of Hibiscus sabdariffa (AEHS) on lipid profile parameters in hyperlipidaemia-induced Wistar rats. Different combinations of low (AEHS 250 mg/kg; simvastatin 10 mg/kg) and high doses (AEHS 500 mg/kg; simvastatin 20 mg/kg) were administered individually and concurrently daily for 2 and 4 weeks. Lipid profile parameters were assessed at these treatment periods. Subsequently, the effect of aqueous beverage of Hibiscus sabdariffa (ABHS) on the pharmacokinetics of single-dose 40 mg simvastatin was also evaluated in six healthy human volunteers using two-period randomized crossover design. Blood samples were collected at predetermined times for 24 hours. The plasma obtained was analysed for simvastatin using RP-HPLC/UV method. RESULTS: Aqueous extract of Hibiscus sabdariffa reduced total cholesterol (Tc ) better than simvastatin (P = .031). Low-dose AEHS and low-dose simvastatin used concomitantly caused 38.3% and 57.4% reductions in Tc and triglyceride levels, respectively, compared with low-dose simvastatin (P < .05). Also, ABHS increased clearance and reduced peak concentration of simvastatin by 44.6% and 18.0%, respectively (P < .05). The geometric mean ratio of simvastatin AUC0-∞ with or without ABHS was 0.646 with the 90% confidence interval (0.564, 0.758) falling outside the bioequivalent range. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Aqueous extract of Hibiscus sabdariffa lowered Tc better than simvastatin and enhanced the antihyperlipidaemic activity of the drug when co-administered at low doses in an animal model. However, aqueous beverage of Hibiscus sabdariffa caused a significant herb-drug interaction resulting in overall reduction in exposure to simvastatin in humans. Caution should thus be placed on clinical judgement or recommendations based on the animal results. Nevertheless, co-administration of the beverage with simvastatin should be discouraged until more clinical data are available.",

The other groups received either 50 mg/kg (n=30, 13 males, 17 females) or 500 mg/kg (n=28, 11 males, 17 females) of an HS aqueous calyx extract orally till postnatal day (PND) 14. There was no intervention from PND 14 to PND 21 when the pups were weaned. The rats in each group were then divided into two groups; one continued on a normal diet and the other received fructose (20% w/v) in their drinking water for 30 days. The female rats that were administered with HS aqueous calyx extract as neonates were protected against fructose-induced hypertriglyceridaemia and increased liver lipid deposition. The early administration of HS resulted in a significant (P⩽0.05) increase in plasma cholesterol concentrations with or without a secondary fructose insult. In males, HS prevented the development of fructose-induced hypercholesterolaemia. The potential beneficial and detrimental effects of neonatal HS administration on the programming of metabolism in rats need to be considered in the long-term well-being of children.",

In this study, aqueous extract of Hibiscus sabdariffa (AEHS) and its bioactive constituent protocatechuic acid (PCA), have been evaluated in vitro for their antiviral activity against HSV-2 clinical isolates and anti-enzymatic activity against urease. Antiherpetic activity was evaluated by the titer reduction assay in infected Vero cells, and cytotoxicity was evaluated by the neutral red dye-uptake method. Anti-urease activity was determined by a developed Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS)-based assay. PCA showed potent anti-HSV-2 activity compared with that of acyclovir, with EC50 values of 0.92 and 1.43 µg∙mL-1, respectively, and selectivity indices > 217 and > 140, respectively. For the first time, AEHS was shown to exert anti-urease inhibition activity, with an IC50 value of 82.4 µg∙mL-1. This, combined with its safety, could facilitate its use in practical applications as a natural urease inhibitor. Our results present Hibiscus sabdariffa L. and its bioactive compound PCA as potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of HSV-2 infection and the treatment of diseases caused by urease-producing bacteria.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: The complex series of deleterious events among diabetes patients leads to multiple organ failure. Therefore, a holistic approach of treatment is urgently required to prevent worsening of complications. The present investigation was carried out to study the possible protective effects of Roselle or Hibiscus sabdariffa Linn (HSL) calyxes aqueous extract, as an antidiabetic and antioxidant agent against oxidative liver injury in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A single dose of streptozotocin (45mg/kg body weight, iv) was used to induced diabetes in male Sprague Dawley rats which were then divided into two groups: Diabetic control (DC) and HSL-treated diabetic (DR) group. Normal rats were divided into normal control (NC), HSL-treated control (NR). Aqueous calyxes extract of HSL (100mg/kg/day, orally) was given for 28 consecutive days in the treated group. Weight, biochemical and histopathological (light and electron microscopic) parameters were compared in all groups. RESULTS: Supplementation of HSL significantly lowered the level of fasting blood glucose and increased plasma insulin level in DR group compared to DC group (p<0.05). Alanine aminotransaminases and aspartate aminotransferase enzymes level were found to be significantly reduced in DR compared to DC. Microscopic examination demonstrated destruction of the liver architecture, cytoplasmic vacuolation of the hepatocytes and signs of necrosis in diabetic rats. Moreover, dilatation and congestion of blood vessels with leucocytes adherence were detected. Ultrastructural study using electron microscope showed homogeneous substance accumulation in nuclear chromatin, a decrease of organelles and mitochondrial degeneration in the diabetic rats. CONCLUSION: Administration of HSL in diabetic rats causes significant decrease in hepatocyte destruction and prevented the changes associated with the diabetic condition. Thus, our findings provide a scientific rationale for the use of HSL as promising agent in preventing liver injury in diabetes.",

This study evaluated the effects of H. sabdariffa aqueous extract against cyclophosphamide (CPA, 25 mg/Kg) induced damage to DNA in male Wistar rats by micronucleus test. Samples of H. sabdariffa calyx were obtained in the municipality of Barra do Garças, Mato Grosso, Brazil. The aqueous extract was prepared by infusion and each animal received a daily dose of 400 mg/Kg by gavage for 15 consecutive days of treatment. The presence of anthocyanins was confirmed by ferric chloride test and phenolic compounds using high-performance liquid chromatography, with emphasis on the identification of rutin. The animals were sacrificed by deepening of anaesthesia to obtain bone marrow and determination of the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes. The group treated with the aqueous extract of H. sabdariffa revealed a 91% reduction in micronucleus frequency when compared with the positive control group. Under the conditions tested, H. sabdariffa L. presented a protective effect to CPA-induced damage to DNA of the treated animals, and it is a potential candidate as a chemopreventive agent against carcinogenesis.",

Green tea and sour tea (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.), which contain various flavonoids and polyphenols, have many healthful properties such as anticarcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, and heart protecting effects. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of green tea and sour tea supplementation on oxidative stress and muscle damage in soccer athletes. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind control trial was conducted on 54 male soccer players. Participants were randomly assigned to three groups to receive: 450 mg/d green tea extract (GTE) in the first group (n = 18), 450 mg/d sour tea extract (STE) in the second group (n = 18) and 450 mg/d maltodextrin in the control group (n = 18). Fasting whole blood samples were taken under resting conditions at the beginning and the end of the study to quantify the serum levels of muscle damage indices, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and oxidative stress biomarkers, malondialdehyde (MDA), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). RESULTS: After six weeks intervention, athletes who received GTE and STE supplements compared with the placebo had a significantly decreased MDA level (P = 0.008). Furthermore, STE supplementation resulted in a significant increase in TAC level compared with GTE and placebo groups (P = 0.01). However, supplementation with GTE and STE had no significant effects on muscle damage indices. CONCLUSION: GTE and STE supplementation have beneficial effects on oxidative stress status in male athletes. However, both kinds of tea extract did not affect muscle damage status.",

      "abstract": "Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. Despite therapeutic improvements, some cancers are still untreatable. Recently there has been an increasing interest in the use of natural substances for cancer prevention and treatment. Hibiscus sabdariffa (HS) is a plant, belonging to Malvaceae family, widespread in South Asia and Central Africa. HS extract (HSE) used in folk medicine, gained researchers' interest thanks to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and chemopreventive properties. In the present study, we initially assessed HSE effect on a panel of human tumor cell lines. Then we focused our study on the following that are most sensitive to HSE action cell lines: Multiple Myeloma (MM) cells (RPMI 8226) and Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) cells (SCC-25). In both RPMI 8226 and SCC-25 cells, HSE impaired cell growth, exerted a reversible cytostatic effect, and reduced cell motility and invasiveness. We evaluated the involvement of MAPKs ERK1/2 and p38 in HSE effects by using specific inhibitors, U0126 and SB203580, respectively. For both SCC-25 and RPMI 8226, HSE cytostatic effect depends on p38 activation, whereas ERK1/2 modulation is crucial for cell motility and invasiveness. Our results suggest that HSE may be a potential therapeutic agent against MM and OSCC.",

Many studies have described that the organic acids from Hibiscus sabdariffa Linne (HSL) calyces increase cellular antioxidant capacity and decrease oxidative stress. Here we evaluate if the antioxidant properties of HSL infusion improve oxidative stress in MFS patients. Activities of extra cellular super oxide dismutase (ECSOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GSSG-R), glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxidation (LPO) index, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and ascorbic acid were determined in plasma from MFS patients. Values before and after 3 months of the treatment with 2% HSL infusion were compared in control and MFS subjects. After treatment, there was a significant decrease in ECSOD (p = 0.03), EGPx (p = 0.04), GST (p = 0.03), GSH (p = 0.01), and TAC and ascorbic acid (p = 0.02) but GSSG-R activity (p = 0.04) and LPO (p = 0.02) were increased in MFS patients in comparison to patients receiving the HSL treatment and C subjects. Therefore, the infusion of HSL calyces has antioxidant properties that allow an increase in antioxidant capacity of both the enzymatic and nonenzymatic systems, in the plasma of the MSF patients.",
