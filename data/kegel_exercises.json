      "abstract": "Background: This is a prospective study. Atrophic vulvovaginitis (VVA), a prevalent condition resulting from estrogen deficiency after the menopause, is characterized by symptoms such as vaginal dryness, itching, burning, dyspareunia, and urinary discomfort. Standard treatment involves systemic estrogen replacement therapy (HRT) and localized estrogen treatments, such as estriol. However, many women with moderate-to-severe VVA may not fully benefit from estrogen therapy alone. Non-hormonal adjunctive treatments, such as pelvic floor exercises (e.g., Kegel exercises), are being explored to enhance clinical outcomes. Objectives: This study investigates the combined effect of local estriol therapy and Kegel exercises in improving VVA symptoms in postmenopausal women. Methods: Fifty postmenopausal women diagnosed with VVA were enrolled and divided into three severity groups: mild, moderate, and severe. All participants received estriol therapy (0.5 mg vaginal tablets daily for 10 days each month) for the first three months. Following this, Kegel exercises were introduced for an additional three-month period, alongside continued estriol therapy. Symptom improvement was evaluated after six months, with outcomes categorized as complete remission, partial remission, or no remission. Results: Significant improvements in symptom remission were observed, particularly in the moderate and severe groups. In the mild VVA group, 81.82% achieved complete remission with combined therapy compared to 68.18% with estriol alone. In the severe group, complete remission was observed in 40% of patients receiving combined therapy compared to 20% with estriol therapy alone. These findings suggest that Kegel exercises enhance the effectiveness of estriol by improving local blood circulation, which facilitates better estrogen absorption and distribution. Conclusions: The addition of Kegel exercises to local estriol therapy significantly improves symptom remission rates, especially in moderate and severe VVA cases. This approach offers a promising strategy for managing postmenopausal VVA, particularly in cases that do not fully respond to estrogen therapy alone."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical efficacy of acupuncture based on \"status-target coherence\" theory combined with Kegel exercises for vaginal laxity syndrome (VLS). METHODS: Sixty-six patients with VLS were randomized into an observation group (33 cases, 2 cases dropped out, 1 case was discontinued) and a control group (33 cases, 5 cases dropped out). The observation group was treated with acupuncture combined with Kegel exercises, acupuncture was applied to bilateral Ciliao (BL32), Zhongliao (BL33), Sanyinjiao (SP6), etc. The control group was treated with Kegel exercises. Both acupuncture and Kegel exercises were performed once every other day, three times a week for 12 weeks. Before and after treatment, the vaginal laxity questionnaire (VLQ) score, pelvic floor muscle strength (vaginal resting pressure, vaginal systolic pressure, vaginal contraction duration), degree of vaginal laxity and sexual satisfaction questionnaire (SSQ) grade were observed in both groups. RESULTS: After treatment, the VLQ score, vaginal resting pressure, vaginal systolic pressure, vaginal contraction duration in the observation group were elevated compared with those before treatment (P<0.05), and SSQ grade was improved (P<0.05); and the above indexes in the observation group were better than those in the control group (P<0.05). There were no significant difference before and after treatment in the degree of vaginal laxity in the two groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture based on \"status-target coherence\" theory combined with Kegel exercises can effectively enhance the strength of pelvic floor muscles, improve the symptoms of vaginal laxity, and improve the satisfaction of sexual life, and its therapeutic effect is better than Kegel exercises alone.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There have been few studies on the effect of Kegel exercises on the treatment of functional constipation in children. Hence, the present study investigated the add-on role of Kegel exercises in children with functional constipation. METHODS: This clinical trial was conducted on children with functional constipation, according to Rome IV, who were referred to the pediatric department of Imam Reza Clinic (Shiraz, Iran) in 2022. The sample consisted of 64 children who were randomly assigned to either the intervention or the control groups. In the control group, a pediatrician administered conventional therapy, including diet training, defecation training, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) syrup (0.7 g/Kg daily). In the treatment group, in addition to conventional therapy, a pediatrician taught Kegel exercises to the child both verbally and in writing in the presence of their parents. To investigate the effectiveness of the intervention, frequency of defecation, defecation time, assistance used for defecation, incomplete emptying, unsuccessful defecation, abdominal pain, and painful defecation were selected as the outcomes. Independent sample t test was used for continuous variables. Categorical variables were reported as frequency and percentages. To examine the difference in categorical outcome variables, Wilcoxon (pre and post), Chi square, and Fisher exact tests were used. Data were analyzed using SPSS software version 21. P<0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Twenty-seven (88.4%) patients in the Kegel exercise group reported a defecation time of less than 5 min, while only 12 (37.5%) patients in the control group reached this time, and this difference was statistically significant (P=0.001). Moreover, patients in the treatment group showed significant improvements in terms of incomplete emptying of stool, unsuccessful defecation, abdominal pain, and painless defecation (P=0.001, P=0.001, P=0.001, P=0.037, respectively). After intervention, the use of laxatives, digits, or enemas to assist defecation was not significantly different between the groups (P=0.659). CONCLUSION: Kegel exercise was an effective adjunctive treatment for pediatric functional constipation.Trial Registration Number: IRCT20230424057984N1.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of Kegel exercises combined with electrical stimulation on the restoration of postpartum pelvic floor muscle (PFM) function. METHODS: Data of 120 parturients with full-term singleton pregnancy who delivered vaginally in the Guang'an People's Hospital were retrospectively analyzed, and the study subjects were grouped into a Kegel exercise group (n=40, receiving Kegel exercise alone), an electrical stimulation group (n=40, receiving electrical stimulation alone) and a combined group (n=40, receiving Kegel exercises combined with electrical stimulation) according to the treatments received. All three groups received intervention for 3 months. The overall response rates (ORRs) at 3 months, changes in PFM strength and vaginal pressure during treatment, the scores of International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI SF), the incontinence quality of life questionnaire (I-QOL), and the incidence rates of pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD) were evaluated in the three groups. RESULTS: ORR in the combined group (100.00%) was higher than that of the Kegel exercises group (87.50%) and the electrical stimulation group (85.00%) (P < 0.05). At 1, 3, and 6 months after intervention, the combined group was superior to the Kegel exercises and the electrical stimulation groups in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of pelvic floor, and the continuous SBP of type I and II muscle fibers (P < 0.05). After 6 months of follow-up, the scores of ICIQ-UI SF and I-QOL in the combined group were higher than those in the Kegel exercises and electrical stimulation groups (P < 0.05). The score of satisfaction in the combined group was higher than in Kegel exercises and electrical stimulation groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Kegel exercises combined with electrical stimulation have a good therapeutic effect on postpartum pelvic floor dysfunction, which can markedly improve PFM strength and vaginal pressure."

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) have been shown to exist in young athletes. The use of pelvic floor muscle training as a preventive strategy at an early age may be useful to avoid possible pelvic floor dysfunction in the future. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to describe LUTS in underaged gymnasts. We also aimed to evaluate the effects of a 12-week Kegel exercise intervention for LUTS and urinary incontinence (UI) and their relationship to bother. STUDY DESIGN: A quasi-experimental (nonrandomized, noncontrolled) pre-post study was conducted. Nineteen gymnasts with a mean age of 13.21 ± 1.84 were selected from a gymnastics club in Madrid, Spain. Outcomes of LUTS and quality of life were measured using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms validated questionnaire at baseline and at the end of the 12-week intervention. RESULTS: The participants presented with certain LUTS such as urgency UI (57.7%) or stress UI (47.4%), which negatively affect their daily lives by feeling annoyed in various aspects (when practicing gymnastics, getting up during the night to urinate or feeling bladder pain among others). No significant differences in LUTS and quality of life variables were observed after the exercise intervention ( P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of LUTS was observed in a sample of underaged high-level gymnasts. The 12-week Kegel exercise intervention did not significantly reduce the presence of pelvic floor problems and even intensified some of them, probably because of an increased awareness. Pelvic floor muscle training as a preventive strategy at an early age seems to be necessary to avoid possible pelvic floor dysfunction in the future.",

Materials and Methods: A parallel group, randomized clinical trial was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Clinical Hospital Centre Zagreb, Croatia. After assessing the inclusion/exclusion criteria, each eligible participant was randomized to one of the two observed groups by flipping a coin: the first group underwent treatment with Kegel exercises for 8 weeks, while the second group underwent EMI during the same time interval. The primary outcome was the effectiveness of treatment as measured by the ICIQ-UI-SF overall score, eight weeks after the commencement of treatment. Results: During the study period, 117 consecutive patients with SUI symptoms were assessed for eligibility. A total of 94 women constituted the study population, randomized into two groups: Group Kegel (N = 48) and Group EMI (N = 46). After 8 weeks of follow-up, intravaginal pressure values in the EMI group were 30.45 cmH2O vs. the Kegel group, whose values were 23.50 cmH2O (p = 0.001). After 3 months of follow-up, the difference was still observed between the groups (p = 0.001). After the end of treatment and 3 months of follow-up, the values of the ICIQ-UI SF and ICIQ-LUTSqol questionnaires in the EMI group were lower than in the Kegel group (p < 0.001). Treatment satisfaction was overall better in the EMI group than in the Kegel group (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Patients treated with EMI had a lower number of incontinence episodes, a better quality of life, and higher overall satisfaction with treatment than patients who performed Kegel exercises.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: The objective was to investigate and compare the efficacy of supervised Kegel exercises with bio-feedback on stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and pelvic floor muscle strength (PFMS) compared with unsupervised Kegel exercises. METHOD: Matched-group quasi-experimental study of 29 female participants divided into two groups (supervised and non-supervised) was conducted over 12 weeks. Baseline measurements of PFMS were undertaken by a women's health physiotherapist and a Kegel exercise regime bespoke designed for each participant. The supervised group visited the physiotherapist monthly for bio-feedback training (BT); the unsupervised group continued at home with their individualised Kegel exercises. Data were collected via a perineometer (Peritron™) and self-reporting responses to questionnaires. All participants received a final PFMS measurement on completion of the study. RESULTS: Overall Incontinence Severity index (ISI) score was significantly lower in the supervised group post-intervention. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests indicated that supervised Kegel exercises significantly reduced frequency (p= 0.002) and severity (p= 0.020) of overall ISI. Analysis of PFMS were not significantly different, despite an increase in maximum voluntary contraction or pelvic floor muscle strength (PFMS) (p= 0.032) in the supervised group. Of the questionnaires, results of Wilcoxon signed-rank tests indicated that \"total bother\" was significantly reduced (p= 0.005) in the supervised group. The correlation analysis between PFMS and ISI did not reveal any significant results. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed that supervised BT is more effective in reducing SUI than unsupervised Kegel exercises, and that this reduction in ISI score did not correlate with the improvement in PFMS.",

      "abstract": "Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is defined as a complaint of inadvertent loss of urine occurring as a result of an increase in intraabdominal pressure. Strong evidence supports the use of pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) as the first-line conservative treatment for SUI. Extracorporeal magnetic stimulation (EMS) is a non-invasive, effective, acceptable, and safe therapeutic modality for SUI. Although PFMT and EMS share most of their influences on the pathophysiology of SUI, it is unclear whether one of these routinely used treatment modalities is superior to another in terms of improvement of clinical outcomes or cost-effectiveness. To the best of our knowledge, no randomized controlled trials have so far directly compared PFMT with EMS. Our aim here is to describe a protocol for such a study. This will be a parallel-group, single-blind, randomised controlled trial compliant with the SPIRIT, CONSORT, and TIDieR reporting guidelines. Participants will be women aged 18 to 65 years who have previously given at least one vaginal delivery (at least 12 months before joining the study) who present with symptoms of SUI lasting at least 6 months yet have not previously received treatment for it. In the first study arm, patients will receive an eight-week, high-intensity, home-based Kegel exercises regimen. In the second study arm, the treatment scheme will consist of 2 sessions of EMS per week for a total of eight weeks. The primary outcome will be effectiveness of treatment as measured by the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Urinary Incontinence-Short Form overall score, eight weeks, three months, and six months after commencement of treatment."

METHOD: The study was conducted with 30 patients in the intervention group (IG) and 30 patients in the control group (CG). Data were collected using a patient information form, CTCAE, EORTC QLQ-C30, and a follow-up form reporting weekly Kegel exercises. Before radiotherapy, the IG was provided with Kegel exercise training via visual training material; exercises were performed under the supervision of the researcher, and the exercise pamphlet was handed out. During radiotherapy, weekly follow-ups were performed by face-to-face contact or phone calls. No similar application was provided to the CG. CTCAE and EORTC QLQ-C30 were evaluated three times (baseline, 4th and 8th weeks of exercises). RESULTS: At the end of the 4th week of exercises, 1st-grade urinary incontinence (UI) developed in the IG (10%) and in the CG (13.3%). At the end of the 8th week, 2nd-grade UI (3.3%) developed in the IG and 1st-grade (10%) and 2nd-grade UI (6.7%) developed in the CG. Fecal incontinence developed in neither group. At the end of the intervention, there was a significant improvement in Role, Social function and Global Health Status in the IG compared with the 4th week scores. In addition, less Fatigue, Diarrhea, Anorexia and Constipation scores were found compared with the baseline. CONCLUSION: Kegel exercises can be recommended as an approach in the prevention of urinary incontinence and to improve quality of life.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Fecal incontinence (FI) is a prevalent condition among community-dwelling women, and has a major impact on quality of life (QoL). Research on treatments commonly used in clinical practice-Kegel exercises, biofeedback, electrostimulation, and transcutaneous neuromodulation-give discordant results and some lack methodological rigor, making scientific evidence weak. The aim is to assess the clinical efficacy of these 4 treatments on community-dwelling women with FI and their impact on severity, QoL and anorectal physiology. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted on 150 females with FI assessed with anorectal manometry and endoanal ultrasonography, and pudendal nerve terminal motor latency, anal/rectal sensory-evoked-potentials, clinical severity, and QoL were determined. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: Kegel (control), biofeedback + Kegel, electrostimulation + Kegel, and neuromodulation + Kegel, treated for 3 months and re-evaluated, then followed up after 6 months. RESULTS: Mean age was 61.09 ± 12.17. Severity of FI and QoL was significantly improved in a similar way after all treatments. The effect on physiology was treatment-specific: Kegel and electrostimulation + Kegel, increased resting pressure (P < 0.05). Squeeze pressures strongly augmented with biofeedback + Kegel, electrostimulation + Kegel and neuromodulation + Kegel (P < 0.01). Endurance of squeeze increased in biofeedback + Kegel and electrostimulation + Kegel (P < 0.01). Rectal perception threshold was reduced in the biofeedback + Kegel, electrostimulation + Kegel, and neuromodulation + Kegel (P < 0.05); anal sensory-evoked-potentials latency shortened in patients with electrostimulation + Kegel (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The treatments for FI assessed have a strong and similar efficacy on severity and QoL but affect specific pathophysiological mechanisms. This therapeutic specificity can help to develop more efficient multimodal algorithm treatments for FI based on pathophysiological phenotypes."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: New methods of conservative treatment of female stress urinary incontinence are needed. We investigated whether superimposed vibration mechanosignals during Kegel exercises could reduce the amount of urinary leakage after 4 and 6 weeks of training. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty women with stress urinary incontinence were included in this prospective cohort study. Vibration mechanosignals were superimposed during Kegel exercises using an intravaginal device. Each training session consisted of 15 maximal contractions of pelvic floor muscles for 5 s. The women performed training (5 min/day) at home for 4 (n = 60) and 6 (n = 36) weeks. Urine leakage (g) during stress test with standardized bladder volume, and contraction force without and with superimposed mechanical stimulations were measured at inclusion (T0 ), and after 4 (T2 ) and 6 (T3 ) weeks of training using an intravaginal device. Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form was recorded at T0 , and in a sub-cohort of women (n = 36) at 2 years follow up. RESULTS: Mean urine leakage reduced significantly from 20.5 (± 12.2) g at T0 to 4.8 (± 6.7) g at T2 and 1.5 (± 6.7) g at T3 . After 4 and 6 weeks of training, urinary leakage was ≤ 4 g on stress test in 44 and 49 of the 60 women, respectively. At T0 , the mean Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form score was 13 (± 2.4), and at 2 years follow up, the score was 6.3 (± 3.75). CONCLUSIONS: Superimposed mechanical stimulation with Kegel exercises significantly reduced urinary leakage in women with stress urinary incontinence.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The sex lives of women are strongly affected by menopause. Non-pharmacologic approaches to improving the sexual function of postmenopausal women might prove effective. AIM: To compare two methods of intervention (formal sex education and Kegel exercises) with routine postmenopausal care services in a randomized clinical trial. METHODS: A randomized clinical trial was conducted of 145 postmenopausal women residing in Chalus and Noshahr, Iran. Their sexual function statuses were assessed using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire. After obtaining written informed consents, they were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (i) formal sex education, (ii) Kegel exercises, or (iii) routine postmenopausal care. After 12 weeks, all participants completed the FSFI again. Analysis of covariance was used to compare the participants' sexual function before and after the interventions, and multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the predictive factors for variation in FSFI scores in the postintervention stage. OUTCOMES: Sexual function was assessed using the FSFI. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and FSFI total scores among the three study groups at the outset of the study. After 12 weeks, the scores of arousal in the formal sex education and Kegel groups were significantly higher compared with the control group (3.38 and 3.15 vs 2.77, respectively). The scores of orgasm and satisfaction in the Kegel group were significantly higher compared with the control group (4.43 and 4.88 vs 3.95 and 4.39, respectively). CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Formal sex education and Kegel exercises were used as two non-pharmacologic approaches to improve the sexual function of women after menopause. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: The main strength of this study was its design: a well-organized randomized trial using precise eligibility criteria with a small sample loss. The second strength was the methods of intervention used, namely non-pharmacologic approaches that are simple, easily accessible, and fairly inexpensive. The main limitation of the study was our inability to objectively assess the participants' commitment to exercise and the sexual function of their partners. CONCLUSION: Sex education programs and Kegel exercises could cause improvements in some domains of sexual function-specifically arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction-in postmenopausal women.

The problem of bedwetting and other urinary complaints are common in rest homes. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to determine the efficiency of bladder training and Kegel exercises for older women living in a rest home. METHODS: This is an experimental prospective research study. Through a randomization process, 25 women were included in the treatment group, and another 25 were included in the control group. Participants were living in a rest home for women aged older than 65 years with urinary complaints. The pretreatment interview form, Quality of Life Scale, Mini-Mental Test, Rankin Scale, daily urinary forms and pad tests were administered to the treatment and control groups. Bladder training and Kegel exercises were given to the treatment group for 6-8 weeks. The second evaluation was performed 8 weeks after treatment, and the last evaluation was carried out 6 months after treatment. RESULTS: The average age of the treatment group was 78.88 +/- 4.80 years, and the average age of the control group 79.44 +/- 5.32 years. Urgency, frequency and nocturia were common complaints. Pretreatment, 8-week and 6-month evaluations revealed that the amount of urinary incontinence with urgency, frequency and nocturia complaints statistically and significantly decreased in the treatment group compared to the control group. In the pad test results, a statistically significant decrease was observed in the treatment group compared to the control group. A significant increase in pelvic floor strength was observed in the treatment group compared to the control group upon all evaluations. CONCLUSION: Behavioral therapy can be used easily as an effective treatment for urinary incontinence in elderly women living at a rest home.",

METHODS: After evaluation by physical, genitourinary and urologically oriented neurological examinations, urogynecologic tests, perineal ultrasonography and cystometry, pure type II anatomic stress incontinence was diagnosed in 98 patients. Modified Pereyra and Burch operations were performed in 27 and 24 of the 51 (52.0%) patients, who had surgical treatments, respectively, while the remaining 47 (48.0%) patients were advised to perform Kegel exercise. The results of the treatment methods were evaluated subjectively by patient questionnaire and 24-hour urinary diary and objectively by one-hour pad test and stress test. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients treated by anti-incontinence operations had 90.2% objective and 94.1% subjective complete successes (cure) with a mean follow-up of 13.7 months. These data were 8.5% and 14.9% respectively, for 47 patients treated by Kegel exercises with a mean follow-up of 12.8 months. Both the subjective and objective cure rates of surgical treatments were found to be significantly higher than those of Kegel exercises in patients with type II anatomic stress incontinence (p<0.01). Patients with good compliance to Kegel exercises had 20.7% subjective and 13.8% objective cures, however those with low compliance had only 5.6% subjective and no objective cures. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggested that anti-incontinence operations were more effective than Kegel exercises for the treatment of patients with type II anatomic stress incontinence.",
