      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a global health challenge with the high morbidity and mortality. Cordyceps militaris (CM) is a medicinal fungus that has been widely used in Asia for centuries. It has the effects of tonifying the lung and kidney, replenishing essence, resolving phlegm, and stopping bleeding. CM has been used clinically for alleviating COPD in China. However, the potential mechanism of CM in treating COPD remains indistinct. PURPOSE: This article aimed to evaluate the efficacy and investigate the underlying mechanism of CM in treatment of COPD. METHODS: The ingredients in CM were identified by LC Q/TOF-MS. The effect of CM in COPD was evaluated. Untargeted metabolomics assay and 16S rDNA sequencing were employed to examine the changes in metabolites and gut microbiota in COPD mice. Gut microbiota ablation experiment and quantification of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were integrated to elucidate the systematic mechanism of CM in treatment of COPD. RESULTS: A total of 22 ingredients were identified in CM. CM alleviated COPD significantly by improving lung function and inhibiting pulmonary inflammation. Subsequently, 11 differential metabolites regulated by CM were mainly associated with amino acid metabolism. CM ameliorated the dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota in COPD mice, which contributed to the treatment of COPD. Moreover, CM increased the contents of SCFAs, including acetate, propionate, butyrate and isobutyrate. Spearman correlation indicated a close relationship among pulmonary function, differential metabolites, and gut microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that CM alleviated COPD by regulating amino acid metabolism, ameliorating the imbalance of gut microbiota and increasing the SCFAs. These findings not only establish a foundation for the research of CM but also provide a basis for new treatment strategies of COPD.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cordyceps sinensis, an entomogenous fungus with unique biological properties, has demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory potential. However, its effects on inflammation regulation need to be further investigated in detail. METHODS: In this study, we aimed to analyze the Cordyceps sinensis extract (CSE) obtained via ethanol extraction and to assess its effects on inflammation regulation. The secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8, and IL-1β) and the level of MMP9, Nrf2/HO-1 and ROS were evaluated. A transwell system with THP-1 and BEAS-2B cells was used to explore the inflammatory damage. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were conducted on the differentially expressed genes. RESULTS: CSE exhibited no cytotoxicity to THP-1 cells at concentrations ≤ 1.6 mg/mL. Treatment of LPS-induced THP-1 cells with CSE significantly inhibited the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. CSE reduced inflammation-related protein MMP9, while upregulating the anti-inflammatory Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. Fluorescence assays using DCF and JC-1 further confirmed that CSE help mitigate oxidative stress-induced inflammation. CSE treatment protected BEAS-2B cells from inflammatory damage. Moreover, the immune system process was a shared GO term between LPS-only treatment and combined LPS and CSE treatment. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that CSE is capable of regulating genes associated with inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the potential of CSE as an immune-regulating agent in functional foods and health products."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cordyceps sinensis is a valuable Chinese medicine that has the effects of tonifying the lungs and kidneys, regulating the immune system, etc. Fermented Cordyceps Powder (FCP) is the fermentation product of Cordyceps sinensis mycelium, which has similar composition and effects to natural Cordyceps sinensis. FCP has been used as an adjunctive treatment of silicosis, however, the complete comprehension of these molecular mechanisms remains elusive. AIM OF THE STUDY: To study the molecular immunological mechanism by which FCP alleviate inflammation and fibrosis in silicosis based on macrophage polarization and High Mobility Group Box protein 1 (HMGB1)-Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) pathway through in vivo and in vitro experiments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A rat model of silicosis and a co-culture cell model (NR8383 and RFL-6) exposed to silica were established and then intervened with different levels of FCP and FCP-containing serum, respectively, to explore the impacts of FCP on silica-induced inflammation and fibrosis and macrophage polarization at different time points. Upon the application of glycyrrhizic acid (GZA) to suppress HMGB1, an extensive analysis was undertaken to elucidate the impact of HMGB1-TLR4-NF-κB axis on the macrophages polarization. RESULTS: FCP reduced M1, M2 macrophage polarization, and the HMGB1 expression in the lung of silicosis rats. Suppression of HMGB1 led to a pronounced reduction in the polarization of M1 macrophages, whereas it exerted no significant influence on the polarization of M2 macrophages. FCP-containing serum reduced silica-induced inflammation and fibrosis in the co-culture cell system. FCP-containing serum also reduced M1 macrophage polarization and inhibited stimulation of the HMGB1-TLR4-NF-κB signaling axis in NR8383 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of M1, M2 macrophage polarization is an important mechanism by which FCP attenuates inflammation and fibrosis in silicosis, in which reduction of M1 macrophage polarization may be achieved by suppression of the HMGB1-TLR4-NF-κB signaling axis.",

      "abstract": "Lung injury is a critical health concern associated with severe inflammatory responses and tissue damage that can weaken respiratory function and potentially become life-threatening in severe cases. This study aimed to establish a mouse model of lung injury induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) derived from Klebsiella pneumoniae and to evaluate whether Cordyceps militaris ARA301 extract (CME) can prevent lung injury. CME was orally administered to mice for three consecutive days, followed by intranasal LPS administration. Mice were sacrificed 24 h later to analyze immune cell alterations and inflammatory responses through bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and tissue analyses. CME administration inhibited immune cell infiltration, tissue fibrosis, and excessive mucus deposition induced by intranasal LPS administration. Furthermore, CME suppressed the expression of mucin 5AC (MUC5AC), a protein involved in mucus production, as well as the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in lung tissues. In BALF, CME reduced the production of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1), which were elevated due to LPS administration. Additionally, CME decreased the total immune cell, neutrophil, monocyte, and eosinophil numbers in BALF. The anti-inflammatory activity of CME was evaluated in vitro using RAW 264.7 cells. CME treatment reduced the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by LPS and inhibited the phosphorylation of p65, inhibitor of kappa B alpha (IκBα), and IκB kinase alpha (IKKα). These findings suggest that CME has potential as a functional health supplement effective in preventing lung injury.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cordyceps sinensis is a fungus, serves dual purposes as both a medicinal herb and a food source. Due to its high water content, fresh Cordyceps sinensis is difficult to preserve, necessitating the drying necessary to process Cordyceps sinensis. METHODS: Using 4D-DIA proteomics, researchers analyzed the proteome profiles of fresh Cordyceps sinensis (CK) under three different drying conditions: vacuum freeze-drying (FD), oven-drying (OD), and air-drying (AD). In addition, it was found that the protein and free sulfhydryl content of Cordyceps sinensis decreased significantly and the disulfide bond content increased after different drying methods. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A total of 3762 proteins were identified, showing variations between groups and high protein content. In the control groups consisting of fresh Cordyceps sinensis samples and the three drying methods, FD. vs CK exhibited the fewest differentially abundant proteins, with the majority being upregulated. On the other hand, CK vs OD displayed the greatest amount of distinct proteins, with a significant rise in both up-regulated and down-regulated proteins. Analysis of KEGG indicated that the distinct proteins were predominantly concentrated in pathways like the ribosome, synthesis of coenzymes, and metabolism of amino sugar and nucleotide sugar. Notably, there was a significant overlap between ribosome and ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes pathways. The process of drying Cordyceps sinensis resulted in a significant upregulation of the expression of proteins linked to various metabolic pathways. This observation suggests that the drying treatment might activate or enhance certain biochemical processes within the organism, potentially influencing its overall metabolic activity. This finding highlights the importance of post-harvest dry methods on the biochemical properties of Cordyceps sinensis, which could have implications for its nutritional and medicinal value.This study provides a theoretical basis for the realization of Cordyceps sinensis resource utilization and storage methods, and provides theoretical support for guaranteeing the sustainable development of Cordyceps sinensis resources."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the protective effects of Cordyceps sinensis against renal injury induced by low-dose contrast medium (CM) in coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) imaging, and to evaluate its efficacy using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). METHODS: Twenty Beagle dogs with induced renal insufficiency were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to one of four groups (n = 5 per group). Group A received Cordyceps sinensis for 1 week prior to undergoing heart rate-dependent personalized CM CCTA scanning; Group B received Cordyceps sinensis for 1 week followed by conventional dose CM CCTA scanning; Group C did not receive Cordyceps sinensis but underwent HR-dependent CM CCTA scanning; and Group D did not receive Cordyceps sinensis but underwent conventional dose CM CCTA scanning. Renal function was assessed using MRI before and after the intervention, with IVIM (Intravoxel Incoherent Motion) and BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent) imaging of the kidneys. Key parameters, including the pure diffusion coefficient (D), pseudo-diffusion coefficient (D*), perfusion fraction (f), and R2*values, were quantified. Laboratory renal function markers were measured multiple times before and after the intervention, and their correlation with fMRI parameters was analyzed. RESULTS: CCTA imaging revealed that the CT values of the major coronary artery branches in all groups met the international diagnostic criteria for coronary arteries. No statistically significant differences in image quality were observed among the four groups (P > 0.05). In Groups A and D, significant changes were observed in renal function parameters, as well as in D, D*, f, and R2* values, both pre- and post-CCTA (P < 0.05). However, Groups B and C exhibited no significant changes pre- and post-CCTA (P > 0.05). A significant correlation was found between MRI parameters and laboratory renal function markers, with excellent inter- and intra-observer reproducibility, and high repeatability in the measurements. CONCLUSION: HR-dependent personalized CM CCTA imaging did not compromise image quality. Administration of Cordyceps sinensis demonstrated a potential protective effect on renal function. The combination of IVIM and BOLD functional MRI offers a reliable, non-invasive approach to assess the protective effects of Cordyceps sinensis on renal injury induced by low-dose CCTA in Beagle dogs."

      "abstract": "Chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs) were synthesized in this study to enhance the limited bioactivity and stability of Cordyceps militaris grown on germinated Rhynchosia nulubilis (GRC) and effectively deliver it to target tissues. Under optimized conditions, stable encapsulation of GRC was achieved by setting the chitosan (CHI)-to-tripolyphosphate (TPP) ratio to 4:1 and adjusting the pH of TPP to 2, resulting in a zeta potential of +22.77 mV, which indicated excellent stability. As the concentration of GRC increased, the encapsulation efficiency decreased, whereas the loading efficiency increased. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy revealed shifts in the amide I and II bands of CHI from 1659 and 1578 to 1639 cm⁻1, indicating hydrogen bonding and successful encapsulation of GRC encapsulated with CNPs (GCN). X-ray diffraction (XRD) examination revealed the transition of the nanoparticles from a crystalline to an amorphous state, further confirming successful encapsulation. In vivo experiments demonstrated that GCN treatment significantly reduced lung injury scores in fine particulate matter (PM2.5)-exposed mice (p < 0.05) and alleviated lung epithelial barrier damage by restoring the decreased expression of occludin protein (p < 0.05). In addition, GCN decreased the PM2.5-induced upregulation of MMP-9 and COL1A1 mRNA expression levels, preventing extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and collagen accumulation (p < 0.05). GCN exhibited antioxidant effects by reducing the mRNA expression of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and enhancing both the protein and mRNA expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD-1) caused by PM2.5, thereby alleviating oxidative stress (p < 0.05). In A549 cells, GCN significantly reduced PM2.5-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production compared with GRC (p < 0.05), with enhanced intracellular uptake confirmed using fluorescence microscopy (p < 0.05). In conclusion, GCN effectively alleviated PM2.5-induced lung damage by attenuating oxidative stress, suppressing apoptosis, and preserving the lung epithelial barrier integrity. These results emphasize its potential as a therapeutic candidate for preventing and treating the lung diseases associated with PM2.5 exposure.",

The results showed that CMME treatment improved pulmonary injury, reduced inflammatory factors and oxidative stress levels, and decreased macrophage activation and neutrophil recruitment. The 16S rRNA results revealed that CMME significantly increased gut microbiota richness and diversity and reduced the abundance of Bacteroides compared with Mod group significantly. Metabolic analysis indicated that CMME reversed the levels of differential metabolites and may ameliorate lung injury through purine metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and bile acid (BA) metabolism, and CMME did reverse the changes of BA metabolites in ALI mice, and BA metabolites were associated with inflammatory factors and intestinal flora. Therefore, CMME may improve lung injury by regulating intestinal flora and correcting metabolic disorders, providing new insights into its mechanism of action.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Currently, there is limited research on the impact of abdominal infection on intestinal damage under microgravity conditions. Cordyceps polysaccharide (CPS), the main active ingredient of Cordyceps, has demonstrated various pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory properties. Moxifloxacin (MXF) is a fourth-generation quinolone antibiotic that is believed to have a dual regulatory effect on immune system activation and suppression. Our objective was to investigate the effects of MXF plus CPS on the intestinal barrier damage due to abdominal infection under microgravity. METHODS: The hindlimb unloading model in rats was employed to simulate microgravity. The rat model of abdominal infection was established by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). MXF, CPS and the combination of the two drugs were used to treat CLP-rats in simulated microgravity. We assessed histopathological changes of ileum by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The intestinal ultrastructure was observed under transmission electron microscopy. Additionally, the expression of intestinal barrier proteins RegIII α/γ and MUC2 was detected by Western blot analysis, while the localization of these proteins within the ileum was examined using immunohistochemistry. Cytometric bead array (CBA) was employed to detect cytokine including IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-1α, CXCL-1, MCP-1, IL-17A, IL-18, and IL-33. Flow cytometry analysis was conducted to determine the percentages of Treg cells, M1 macrophages, M2 macrophages, T cells and CD8+T cells. RESULTS: The results showed that compared with the normal gravity groups, the simulated microgravity groups exhibited a significant decrease in RegIII α/γ protein expression, an increase in M1 macrophage frequency, and elevated levels of TNF-α, IL-1α, MCP-1 and IL-6. Notably, the combined application of MXF and CPS effectively mitigated intestinal barrier damage in CLP-rats exposed to microgravity, as evidenced by alleviated ultrastructural and pathological impairments in ileum, along with increased expression of key intestinal barrier proteins MUC2 and RegIII α/γ. Furthermore, the combination therapy enhances the proportion of T cells, CD8+T cells, and M2 macrophages in septic rats exposed to simulated microgravity while reducing the frequency of Treg cells and M1 macrophages. MXF plus CPS also led to a reduction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-1α, CXCL-1, MCP-1, IL18, and IL33. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that MXF plus CPS exhibited a protective effect on intestinal barrier damage due to abdominal infection under microgravity, potentially attributed to its anti-inflammatory properties and immune regulatory mechanisms. These findings may provide insights into the development of drugs targeting abdominal infections in the space environment.",

      "abstract": "Background: Polysaccharides produced by the edible fungus Cordyceps cicadae can regulate blood sugar levels and may represent a suitable candidate for the treatment of diabetes and its complications. However, there is limited information available about the mechanism of how C. cicadae polysaccharide (CCP) might improve diabetic conditions. Methods: This study investigated its effects on the intestinal microbiota, intestinal mucosal barrier, and inflammation in mice with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) induced by streptozotocin, and its potential mechanisms. Results: Compared with the DC (diabetes model control group), CCPH oral treatment significantly increased the number of beneficial bifidobacteria, bifidobacteria, and lactobacilli (p < 0.01), restored the diversity of intestinal microorganisms in diabetic mice, and the proportions of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes (34.36%/54.65%) were significantly lower than those of the DC (52.15%/32.09%). Moreover, CCPH significantly reduced the content of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) and D-lactic acid(D-LA) (p < 0.05), the activities of antioxidant enzymes and total antioxidant capacity were significantly increased (p < 0.01), and the content of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β were reduced by 42.05%, 51.28%, and 52.79%, respectively, compared with the DC. The TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway, as a therapeutic target for diabetic intestinal diseases, plays a role in regulating the inflammatory response and protecting the intestinal barrier function. Molecular mechanism studies showed that oral treatment with CCPH down-regulated the expression of NF-κB, TLR-4, and TNF-α genes by 18.66%, 21.58%, and 34.87%, respectively, while up-regulating the expression of ZO-1 and occludin genes by 32.70% and 25.11%, respectively. CCPH regulates the expression of short-chain fatty acid levels, increases microbial diversity, and ameliorates mouse colon lesions by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway. Conclusions: In conclusion, it is demonstrated that in this murine model, the treatment of diabetes with C. cicadae polysaccharide can effectively regulate intestinal microbiota imbalance, protect intestinal mucosal barrier function, and reduce inflammation in vivo, suggesting this natural product can provide a suitable strategy for the treatment of T2D-induced gut dysbiosis and intestinal health."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fatty Liver Disease (FLD) progresses from steatosis to steatohepatitis and, if left untreated, can lead to irreversible conditions such as cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma. The etiology of FLD remains unclear, but factors such as overconsumption, poor diet, obesity, and diabetes contribute to its development. Palmitic acid (PA) plays a significant role in FLD progression by inducing apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in hepatocytes. Cordyceps militaris (CM), a fungus with various biological activities, including antioxidant properties is examined both in vitro and in vivo to assess its effectiveness in mitigating PA-induced hepatocyte apoptosis and preventing FLD progression. PURPOSE: This study aims to investigate the potential and mechanism of CM in combating FLD, particularly in inhibiting hepatocyte apoptosis. METHODS: In vitro studies utilized Clone9 hepatocytes treated with PA to simulate FLD conditions. The effects of CM ethyl acetate extract (EAECM) on apoptosis, mitochondrial function, ER stress, inflammation, and oxidative stress were evaluated. In vivo experiments involved FVB mice fed a NASH diet containing high levels of PA to induce FLD, with powdered CM administered orally to assess its impact on body weight, fasting blood glucose level, liver health, fibrosis, and markers of ER stress, inflammation, and oxidative stress. RESULTS: EAECM demonstrated protective effects against PA-induced apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, ER stress, inflammation, and oxidative stress in vitro. In vivo, powdered CM supplementation attenuated body weight gain, improved fasting blood glucose level, prevented hepatomegaly, reduced serum triglycerides, and inhibited liver fibrosis. Furthermore, powdered CM treatment mitigated ER stress, inflammation, and oxidative stress in the liver of mice receiving a NASH diet. CONCLUSION: C. militaris holds promise as a therapeutic agent for FLD, as evidenced by its ability to alleviate PA-induced hepatocytes damage and hinder FLD progression in mice. Further research is warranted to identify the active compounds responsible for its beneficial effects and to explore its potential clinical applications in treating FLD."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The effectiveness of using Cordyceps sinensis as an adjuvant therapy for patients with renal dysfunction (RD), especially acute kidney injury (AKI), is still a topic of debate. In response to the current conflicting data, the present meta-analysis was conducted to assess the clinical effectiveness of C. sinensis in the treatment of RD and to provide evidence for clinical practice. METHODS: Several databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wanfang, were systematically searched updated to March 25, 2024. We used the combined ratio (OR) and diagnostic ratio (DOR) to assess the therapeutic effect of C. sinensis. In addition, risk of bias was assessed by Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. RESULTS: The present meta-analysis ultimately incorporated 15 studies comprising a total of 1,310 patients with RD. We pooled estimated the sensitivity, specificity as well as DOR from patient-based analyses with 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.84-0.93), 0.69 (95% CI: 0.59-0.77) and 18.0 (95% CI: 8.0-39.0), respectively. Moreover, we calculated the combined positive likelihood ratio (PLR) as well as negative likelihood ratio (NLR) to be 2.8 (95% CI: 2.1-3.9) and 0.16 (95% CI: 0.10-0.27), respectively. Additionally, area under the curve (AUC) of the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) was calculated as 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85-0.90) reflecting prognostic accuracy. Subsequently, subgroup analysis indicated that the clinical efficacy of C. sinensis in northern Chinese patients with RD was superior to that of southern. On the other hand, C. sinensis significantly reduced patients' blood creatinine levels, shortened the oliguria period, and increased urine osmolality, indicating it can improve the function of glomeruli and renal tubules. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that C. sinensis can be considered a dependable clinical treatment for individuals with RD. It may improve the function of glomeruli and tubules, promote the recovery of tubular function, and thus enhance the clinical therapeutic effects.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Cordyceps militaris (CM) and Armillaria mellea (AM) are medicinal mushrooms with potential applications in the treatment of mood disorders, including depression and anxiety. While research suggests that both CM and AM possess anti-inflammatory properties and hold potential for treating depression when administered separately, there is limited knowledge about their efficacy when combined in a formula, as well as the underlying mechanism involving the modulation of microglia. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: Rats received oral administrations of the low-dose formulation, medium-dose formulation, and high-dose formulation over 28 consecutive days as part of the UCMS protocols. The concentrations of serotonin, dopamine, and the corresponding metabolites in the rat prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were assessed. Blood samples were collected to examine corticosterone levels, and the brains were dissected for evaluating activated microglia morphologies and associated pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling pathways. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The CM-AM formula effectively averted abnormal behaviors triggered by UCMS, such as anhedonia and hypoactivity, and decreased the turnover rate of monoamines in both the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The formula mitigated the increase in serum corticosterone levels induced by chronic stress. Furthermore, the formula alleviated stress-induced microglia activation in the hippocampus, achieving this by down-regulating hyperactivated pro-inflammatory proteins and up-regulating hypoactivated anti-inflammatory proteins in the hippocampus. The antidepressant-like effects potentially stemming from the regulation of neurotransmitters and immunomodulation, likely by restoring the balance of M1 and M2 microglia fractions in the hippocampus. Consequently, the CM-AM formula could be explored as a prospective complementary and alternative therapy for depression."

      "abstract": "To determine the compatibility of two new biocontrol fungi with common chemical pesticides, this study examined the effects of three insecticides, namely, avermectin, imidacloprid, and acetamiprid, and three fungicides, namely, chlorogenonil, boscalid, and kasugamycin, on the mycelial growth and spore germination of Cordyceps javanica strains IF-1106 and IJ-tg19. The insecticidal effects of mixed insecticides or fungicides with good compatibility with C. javanica IJ-tg19 against Myzus persicae were tested. The results showed that the six chemical pesticides exerted different degrees of inhibition on the mycelial growth of both C. javanica strains, with an obvious dose-dependent effect. The inhibitory effect of chlorothalonil on the mycelial growth of IF-1106 and IJ-tg19 was greater than 75%. Different kinds and concentrations of chemical pesticides had significant effects on spore germination. Among them, acetamiprid had little inhibitory effect on C. javanica spores. Therefore, the two C. javanica strains exhibited good compatibility with the insecticide acetamiprid and had some compatibility with avermectin and imidacloprid. Among the fungicides, the compatibility of the two strains of biocontrol fungi was the best with kasugamycin, followed by boscalid, while their compatibility with chlorothalonil showed the least compatibility. The median lethal time (LT50) of five concentrations of C. javanica IJ-tg19 (1 × 103, 1 × 104, 1 × 105, 1 × 106, and 1 × 107 spore/mL) mixed with acetamiprid against M. persicae were 5.28, 4.56, 3.80, 2.73, and 2.13 days, respectively, and the insecticidal rate was higher than that of fungus treatment alone (5.19, 4.59, 4.05, 3.32, and 2.94 days, respectively) or chemical pesticide treatment (5.36 days). This study provides data support and a theoretical basis for reducing the use of chemical pesticides, improving the efficiency of C. javanica-based insecticides, and optimizing the synergistic use of fungi and chemical pesticides."

CS is a rich reservoir of various bioactive substances including nucleosides, sterols flavonoids, peptides, and phenolic compounds. The bioactive compounds and CS extract have antibacterial, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, and inflammatory properties in addition to organ protection properties across a range of disease states. The study aimed to review the potential of CS, a medicinal mushroom, as a treatment for sepsis. While current sepsis drugs have side effects, CS shows promise due to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial properties. We have performed an extensive literature search based on published original and review articles in Scopus and PubMed. The keywords used were Cordyceps, sepsis, and inflammation. Studies indicate that CS extract and bioactive compounds target free radicals including oxidative as well as nitrosative stress, lower inflammation, and modulate the immune system, all of which are critical components in sepsis. The brain, liver, kidneys, lungs, and heart are among the organs that CS extracts may be able to shield against harm during sepsis. Traditional remedies with anti-inflammatory and protective qualities, such as Cordyceps mushrooms, are promising in sepsis. However, more research including clinical trials is required to validate the usefulness of CS metabolites in terms of organ protection and fight infections in sepsis.",

EPS-LM, an exopolysaccharide (EPS) from the Cordyceps sinensis fungus Cs-HK1, has shown notable anti-inflammatory activities in previous studies. This study aimed to investigate the major signaling events mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of EPS-LM in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage cell culture. EPS-LM treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). It also suppressed the expression levels of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), subsequently delaying the translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) to the nucleus. Additionally, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments demonstrated that EPS-LM inhibited the binding of TLR4 to MyD88. The ability of EPS-LM to inhibit the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway, coupled with its capacity to reduce oxidative stress, underscores its multifaceted anti-inflammatory effects. These effects render EPS-LM as a promising candidate for the comprehensive management of various inflammatory and oxidative stress-related conditions, protecting against cell damage.",

This study analyzes the inhibitory effects of C. militaris aqueous extract on Candida albicans infections and the immune response in larvae of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). Larvae exhibited melanization within 1 h of being infected with C. albicans inoculum at a concentration of 106 cells/larvae, and died within 24 h from a lethal dose. Aqueous extract of C. militaris proved to be nontoxic at concentrations of 0.25 and 0.125 mg/larvae, and had the greatest ability to prolong the survival of larvae infected with a sublethal dose of C. albicans at a concentration of 105 cells/larvae. Moreover, the number of hemocytes in the hemolymph of G. mellonella increased after infection with C. albicans and treatment with the aqueous extract of C. militaris at 1, 24, and 48 h by 1.21 × 107, 1.23 × 107, and 1.4 × 107 cells/100 µL, respectively. The highest number of hemocytes was recorded after treatment of infected G. mellonella with the extract for 48 h. Transcriptional upregulation of the immune system was observed in certain antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), showing that the relative expression of galiomicin, gallerimycin, and lysozyme genes were upregulated as early as 1 h after infection. Therefore, we conclude that C. militaris aqueous extract can modulate the immune system of G. mellonella and protect against infection from C. albicans."

Recently, Cordyceps has been shown to manifest a diverse range of pharmacological activities, rendering it applicable for the treatment and mitigation of various diseases, such as diabetes, acute liver injury, and colitis. Many active constituents have been identified from Cordyceps sinensis, including cordycepin, adenosine, sterols, and polysaccharides. Polysaccharides constitute a primary active component of Cordyceps, exhibiting immunomodulatory effects. We searched the Web of Science database with the keywords of cordyceps, polysaccharide, and immune modulation; collected related studies from 2004 to 2024; and eliminated articles with low influence and workload. A review of the research advancements regarding the immunomodulatory effects of Cordyceps polysaccharides was conducted with the aim of furnishing valuable reference information. Research indicates that polysaccharides exhibiting immunomodulatory activity are predominantly sourced from Cordyceps sinensis and Cordyceps militaris. Immunological experimental results demonstrate that Cordyceps polysaccharides can augment the activities of macrophages, lymphocytes, and dendritic cells while fostering the expression of immune-active substances such as cytokines and chemokines. Furthermore, animal experiments have substantiated the immunomodulatory effects of Cordyceps polysaccharides. These effects encompass ameliorating immune suppression induced by drugs or radiation, enhancing immune organ indices, elevating the expression of immunoreactive substances, and mitigating immune evasion prompted by tumors. In conclusion, Cordyceps polysaccharides exhibit significant immunomodulatory activity and merit further investigation.",

      "abstract": "Cordyceps militaris extract (CME) contains many bioactive compounds, mainly cordycepin (CPN). This study aimed to investigate the possible mechanisms underlying the amelioration of LPS-induced acute liver injury in piglets by CME or CPN supplementation using multi-omics analysis. Twenty-four weaned piglets were randomly distributed into 4 groups (n = 6): the control and LPS groups were fed basal diets; the CPN + LPS (CPN-LPS) and CME + LPS (CME-LPS) groups were fed the basal diets supplemented with CME or CPN. The results showed that CPN or CME supplementation significantly decreased the C-reactive protein level (p < 0.05) and improved liver tissue pathology to prevent acute liver injury after LPS treatment. Compared with LPS, the transcriptomic analysis indicated that CPN supplementation significantly downregulated cell adhesion molecules, while CME supplementation significantly downregulated inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels, complement and coagulation cascades and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. The metabolomic results showed that CPN or CME supplementation significantly reduced disease biomarker of bicyclo-prostaglandin E2, and increased levels of deoxyinosine and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (p < 0.05). The combined transcriptome and metabolome helped identify two metabolites PC 34:2 and PC 36:0, which may be associated with the restoration of liver cell morphology. In conclusion, CPN and CME could attenuate LPS-induced acute liver injury by regulating immune-related genes and metabolites. This study elucidates the potential protective mechanism of CPN or CME supplementation against acute liver injury."

      "abstract": "Objective: A mouse silicosis model was constructed by injecting silicon dioxide (SiO(2)) particles into the trachea to explore the effect and mechanism of Cordyceps cicadae polysaccharides (CCP) on ameliorating pulmonary fibrosis in silicosis mice. Methods: In May 2023, CCP were extracted and isolated, the monosaccharide composition and functional group composition were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. C57BL/6J mice were injected with 50 μl 50 mg/ml SiO(2) suspension to construct silicosis mouse model, which were then randomly divided into model group, CCP intervention groups [low dose group (LCCP group), medium dose group (MCCP group) and high dose group (HCCP group) ], the control group was administered by physiological saline, 8 mice in each group. Mice in the CCP intervention groups received oral gavage administration once daily with CCP solution (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg), while control group and model group received physiological saline, lasted for 30 days. The body weight of mice was recorded and the lung coefficient was calculated. The pathomorphological changes of mouse lung tissue were determined by HE and Masson staining. The contents of fibrosis indexes [hydroxyproline acid (HYP), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP-2) ] of lung tissue and the pro-inflammatory factors[tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) ] of lung tissue and alveolar lavage fluid were determined by ELISA. The expression level of Collagen Ⅰ was determined by immunohistochemistry. The relative protein expression levels of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), P-Smad2, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor kappa-B p65 (NF-κBp65) and myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) in lung tissue were determined by Western blot. Results: The total sugar content of the CCP was 86.78%, composed of D-mannose, D-rhamnose, D-glucose and D-galactose, with a molar ratio of 12.71∶1.53∶1.00∶12.64. The infrared spectrum indicated the characteristic groups of its polysaccharides. Compared with the control group, the body weight of mice in the model group was decreased, lung coefficient was increased, the contents of HYP, CTGF and MMP-2 in lung tissue were increased, and the contents of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in lung tissue and alveolar lavage fluid were increased (P<0.05). The mice lung showed massive inflammatory cell infiltration and collagen fiber deposition, and the silicosis fibrosis was severe. The expression of CollagenⅠin lung tissue of model group was increased, and the proteins expression levels of TGF-β1, P-Smad2/Smad2, α-SMA, TLR4, NF-κBp65 and MyD88 were increased in mouse lung tissue (P<0.05). Compared with the model group, the body weights of mice in the MCCP and HCCP groups were increased, the lung coefficients were decreased, the contents of HYP, CTGF and MMP-2 in lung tissue were decreased, and the contents of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in lung tissue and alveolar lavage fluid were decreased (P<0.05). The inflammatory cell infiltration in the lung was reduced, and the degree of fibrosis was improved to varying degrees. The expression level of CollagenⅠwas down-regulated in the lung tissue of MCCP and HCCP groups, and the protein expression levels of TGF-β1, P-Smad2/Smad2, α-SMA, TLR4, NF-κBp65 and MyD88 were decreased in lung tissue (P<0.05) . Conclusion: The CCP could reduce the levels of fibrosis-related indicators and pro-inflammatory factors in lung tissue, ameliorating mouse lung inflammation and silicosis fibrosis caused by SiO(2) particles by inhibiting the activation of TGF-β1/Smad pathway and TLR4/nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) pathway.",

      "abstract": "Cordyceps sinensis, known as the caterpillar fungus, constitutes an invaluable and irreplaceable part of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and is now gaining widespread global recognition and dedicated attention owing to both highly promising characteristics as well as grave dangers that are suggestive of an impending doom. C. sinensis possibly holds the key to the treatment of many human ailments with minimal side effects due to a wide array of biologically active chemical constituents. The powerful potential harbored by this fungus has led to a meteoric rise in its prices in the domestic and international markets which has caused the involvement of an increasing number of harvesters, traders, and buyers and unchecked overexploitation of this bioresource thus threatening its long-term survival in its natural habitat of the Himalayan region. This review focuses on the ethnopharmacology of C. sinensis, and various aspects related to its conservation, such as natural distribution, sale and revenue, decline in population density, and conservational practices prevalent in the current scenario of fungal depletion. The paper concludes with a comprehensive evaluation of the discrete therapeutic capabilities possessed by C. sinensis, the mechanistic insights into the remarkable treatment of chronic ailments using the fungus or its derivatives, and a suggested strategic roadmap that may be adopted for fruitful conservation of this natural miracle."

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder marked by aberrant glucose metabolism and reproductive dysfunction. It is characterized by polycystic ovaries, ovulatory dysfunction, and hyperandrogenemia. PCOS patients often experience a persistent, mild inflammation linked to various metabolic issues and insulin resistance (IR). Cordyceps polysaccharide (CP), extracted from the asexual form of the fungus Cordyceps gunnii, Hirsutella sinensis, is a bioactive crude polysaccharide with triple helix structure. CP was a spherical molecular polymer composed of rhamnose, arabinose, aminoglucose hydrochloride, galactose, glucose, and mannose, and has two molecular weights, 156.511 and 27.298 kDa. Our results corroborated that CP improve polycystic lesions in ovarian tissue and regulates hormone levels and the estrous cycle in rats with PCOS. However, the mechanism of action of this therapy in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome is not clear. In the present study, CP was found to modulates disturbances in glucose-lipid metabolism in model rats. In addition, it modulated gut microbiota by decreasing abundance of Gram-negative bacteria (norank_f__Desulfovibrionaceae, Helicobacter), hereby inhibiting the production and transfer of LPS into the systemic circulation. This suppressed the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB inflammatory pathway in the liver and adipose tissue and restored insulin signaling, which improved IR in PCOS rats. Our findings demonstrate that based on the regulation of gut microbiota disorders and the repair of intestinal barrier damage, CP inhibited the gut-derived LPS/TLR4 inflammatory pathway in liver to attenuated IR, which led to the improvement of ovarian polycystic lesions. In addition, this study tapped into the role of Cordyceps polysaccharides in improving female reproductive function, expanding its clinical application in women with PCOS, which is innovative and offers valuable insights into the therapeutic potential of CP for treating PCOS."

This study investigates the effects of cordycepin and C. militaris ethanolic extract (Cm-EE) on sensitizing cancer cells and regulating immune responses against breast cancer (BC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Cordycepin, pentostatin and adenosine were identified in Cm-EE. Cordycepin treatment decreased HLA-ABC-positive cells in pre-treated cancer cells, while Cm-EE increased NKG2D ligand and death receptor expression. Additionally, cordycepin enhanced NKG2D receptor and death ligand expression on CD3-negative effector immune cells, particularly on natural killer (NK) cells, while Cm-EE pre-treatment stimulated IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10 production. Co-culturing cancer cells with effector immune cells during cordycepin or Cm-EE incubation resulted in elevated cancer cell death. These findings highlight the potential of cordycepin and Cm-EE in improving the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy for BC and HCC.",

We aim to assess the efficacy and safety of a preparation of C sinensis named Bailing capsule (Hirsutella sinensis, Cs-C-Q80) compared with a placebo in patients with CB. Methods: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial (Chinese Clinical Trial Registry; registration number: ChiCTR1900025707) recruited patients with CB from eight hospitals in China between May 2019 and December 2020. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive Bailing capsule or a placebo orally for 48 weeks (2.0 g, three times a day). Results: Among 240 patients who were randomized, 238 (Bailing capsule: 159, placebo: 79) were included in the primary analysis. Bailing capsule significantly reduced the frequency of acute exacerbation of CB (AECB) compared with the placebo during treatment (0.43 ± 0.82 vs. 1.56 ± 1.34; P < 0.001) and follow-up (0.21 ± 0.64 vs. 0.45 ± 0.93; P = 0.026). Bailing capsule improved the severity of expectoration (P = 0.046) and wheezing (P = 0.010) in AECB during follow-up. The severity of CB after treatment was significantly improved in the Bailing capsule group compared with the placebo group (P = 0.035), particularly in terms of expectoration (P = 0.012) and wheezing (P = 0.003). The risk of adverse events, mainly including infectious and invasive diseases and gastrointestinal symptoms, did not significantly differ between the two groups (29.6% vs. 30.4%). Conclusion: In patients with CB, Bailing capsule significantly reduces the frequency of AECB and ameliorates the severity of AECB and CB symptoms.

We found that CGP notably reduced fat mass, improved blood lipid levels and hepatic damage, and restored the gut microbiota dysbiosis induced by high-fat diet (HFD). Metabolome analyses showed that CGP changed the composition of bile acids, and regulated HFDI metabolic disorder in hepatic tissue. Transcriptome comparison showed that the improvement of hepatic steatosis for CGP was mainly related to lipid and carbohydrate metabolism.

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cordyceps militaris, a traditional medicinal fungus, parasitizes the intestines of lepidopteron pupae or larvae, predominantly during the winter, and undergoes fruiting in the summer or autumn. Compounds extracted from C. militaris have demonstrated a broad spectrum of pharmacological effects, including antioxidant, anti-tumor, anti-metastatic, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, anti-diabetic, and various others. AIM OF THE STUDY: Herein, our study aimed at elucidating the acute, sub-acute toxicity, and genotoxicity profiles of C. militaris methanolic extract following oral administration in Swiss albino mice, representing the inaugural comprehensive exploration of the toxicological and safety profiles of C. militaris. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prior studies have predominantly focused on its biological activities rather than its toxicity. Acute oral toxicity study was conducted at 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/Kg B.W. doses of C. militaris over a 14-day period. For sub-acute toxicity study, three groups of mice were administered 100, 300, and 600 mg/Kg B.W. of C. militaris extract for 28 consecutive days; one group served as a control. Mice were monitored for their body weight and behavioural changes once daily. Hematological, serum biochemical, histopathological, histomorphometric, seminal parameters, and mutagenic investigations were performed post-treatment period. RESULTS: Acute oral toxicity study at 2000 mg/Kg revealed no signs of toxicity, with an LD50 value surpassing 2000 mg/Kg. No occurrences of mortality observed, and no significant changes were noted in body weight, organ weight, or behaviour. Hematological analysis illustrated a marked upsurge in RBC, Hb, HCT, PLT, MPV, and PCT, alongside minor variations in differential leucocyte count post 28-day treatment. Liver enzyme tests indicated slight elevation in ALP, while renal enzyme tests showed alterations in CRE and BUN levels. Genotoxicity profile and histopathological assessments of the liver, spleen, testis, and ovary manifested no remarkable irregularities, except for mild renal toxicity. Seminal parameters including sperm concentration, motility and testosterone levels demonstrated a noteworthy increase. CONCLUSIONS: The study sheds light on the potential risks and safety considerations associated with C. militaris-based medicinal products. These findings establish a foundation for further investigations and the refinement of dosage optimization in the application of C. militaris, with the aim of mitigating any potential adverse effects.",

In this study, a bioinformatic approach was employed to investigate d-amino acid-activating adenylation domains, leading to the identification of cordysetin A (1), a novel trans-decalin tetramic acid antibiotic from the ascomycete fungi Cordyceps militaris. Cordysetin A (1) exhibits considerable activity against M. tuberculosis in vitro and in vivo while maintaining low cytotoxicity. These results reveal that the d-configuration of the amino acid within this hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal antibiotic is crucial for preserving its anti-tuberculosis efficacy.

      "abstract": "In this study, we first screened and evaluated the inhibitory effects of seven medicinal fungi on diseases such as hyperuricemia (HUA). Then, using metabolomics and gut microbiome methods, the focus was on analyzing and evaluating the effects of the aqueous extract of Cordyceps. militaris (CME) and cordycepin on potassium oxyzinate induced HUA mice. It was found that CME exhibits good uric acid lowering activity in both in vivo and in vitro experiments. It can relieve hyperuricemia by inhibiting xanthine oxidase enzyme activity, reducing the production of xanthine precursors, and inhibiting insulin resistance. The uric acid-lowering efficacy of cordycepin in vivo is comparable to that of CME. The species abundance of Oscillibacter, Alistipes, Prevotellaaceae_NK3B31, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136 were decreased after treatment with CME and cordycepin. The metabolomics analysis of cecal contents and fecal samples elucidated the mechanism of intervention of CME on hyperuricemia from different perspectives. This suggests that we should consider carefully when selecting samples. This current research provides the scientific foundation for the medicinal research of C. militaris and the maintenance of human health.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cordyceps cicadae (C.cicadae), named \"Chan Hua\", an anamorph of Isaria cicadae Miquel, is an entomogenous complex formed by fungi parasitizing on the larvae of cicadas and belongs to the Claviciptaceae family and the genus Codyceps, which traditionally holds a significant place in Chinese ethnopharmacology, specifically for eye clarity and as a remedy for age-related ocular conditions. The underlying mechanisms contributing to its eyesight enhancement and potential effectiveness against Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) remain unexplored. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aims to elucidate the protective role of C.cicadae and its active ingredient, Myriocin (Myr), against AMD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A chemical inducer was employed to make retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) damage in vitro and in vivo. The key ingredients of C.cicadae and their related mechanisms for anti-AMD were studied through bioinformatic analysis and molecular biological approaches. RESULTS: Myr was identified through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as an active ingredient in C.cicadae, and demonstrated a protective effect on RPE cells, reducing the structural damage and cell death induced by sodium iodate (SI). Further, Myr reduced eyelid secretions in AMD mice and restored their retinal structure and function. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Myr treatment are primarily associated with TNF and Necroptosis signaling pathways. Molecular docking indicated a strong affinity between TNF and Myr. Myr inhibited the TNF signaling pathway thereby reducing the expression of inflammatory factors in ARPE-19 cells. Additionally, Myr had consistent action with the necroptosis inhibitor Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), inhibited the RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL pathway thereby protecting ARPE-19 cells. CONCLUSION: The findings present Myr, as a potent protector against SI-induced AMD, predominantly through modulation of the TNF-RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL signaling pathway, offering the insights of therapeutic C.cicadae as viable candidates for AMD treatment.",

      "abstract": "To explore the effects of cordyceps militaris (CM) on growth performance and intestinal epithelium functions, 180 weaned pigs were randomly assigned into 5 treatments with 6 replicate pens per treatment (6 pigs per pen). Pigs were fed with basal diet (control) or basal diet supplemented with 100, 200, 400, and 800 mg/kg CM. The trial lasted for 42 d, and pigs from the control and optimal-dose groups (based on growth performance) were picked for blood and tissue collection (n = 6). Results showed that CM elevated the average daily gain (ADG) and decreased the ratio of feed intake to gain (F:G) in the weaned pigs (P < 0.05). CM supplementation at 100 mg/kg improved the digestibilities of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), and gross energy (GE) (P < 0.05). CM not only increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and catalase (CAT) but also increased the concentration of interleukin-10 (IL-10) in serum (P < 0.05). The serum concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA), d-lactate, and diamine oxidase (DAO) were reduced by CM (P < 0.05). Interestingly, CM elevated the villus height and the ratio of villus height to crypt depth in the duodenum and jejunum and increased the activities of duodenal sucrase and maltase (P < 0.05). Moreover, CM elevated the expression levels of tight-junction proteins ZO-1, claudin-1, and occluding, as well as critical functional genes such as the fatty acid transport protein (FATP1), cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT1), and NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in the duodenum and jejunum (P < 0.05). Importantly, CM increased the concentrations of acetic acid and butyric acid, and elevated the abundances of Bacillus and Lactobacillus in the cecum and colon, respectively (P < 0.05). These results indicated potential benefits of CM in improving the growth of weaned pigs, and such effect may be tightly associated with improvement in antioxidant capacity and intestinal epithelium functions.",

Due to the lack of an effective vaccine with durable immunity, the disease transited into the endemic phase, necessitating potent antiviral therapy including a scientific basis for current traditional herbal medicine. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to conduct a pharmacoinformatic analysis of selected chemical ingredients and in-vitro evaluation of Cordyceps militaris extract against SARS-CoV-2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: C. militaris, the widely used fungus in conventional herbal medicine, was subjected to computational investigation using molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulation and network pharmacology analysis followed by the in-vitro assay for evaluating its anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential. RESULTS: The molecular docking analysis of C. militaris revealed the Cordycepin's highest affinity (-9.71 kcal/mol) than other molecules, i.e., Cicadapeptin-I, Cicadapeptin-II, Cordycerebroside-B, and N-Acetyl galactosamine to the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. C. militaris aqueous extract could reduce the SARS-CoV-2 viral copy numbers by 50.24% using crude extract at 100 μg/mL concentration. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that C. militaris has promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and may be explored as traditional medicine for managing the COVID-19 surge in the endemic phase."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cordyceps has a long medicinal history as a nourishing herb in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Ischemic cardio-cerebrovascular diseases (CCVDs), including cerebral ischemic/reperfusion injury (CI/RI) and myocardial ischemic/reperfusion injury (MI/RI), are major contributors to mortality and disability in humans. Numerous studies have indicated that Cordyceps or its artificial substitutes have significant bioactivity on ischemic CCVDs, however, there is a lack of relevant reviews. AIM OF THE STUDY: This review was conducted to investigate the chemical elements, pharmacological effects, clinical application and drug safety of Cordycepson ischemic CCVDs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted on the Web of Science, PubMed, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang databases using the keywords \"Cordyceps\", \"Cerebral ischemic/reperfusion injury\", and \"Myocardial ischemic/reperfusion injury\" or their synonyms. The retrieved literature was then categorized and summarized. RESULTS: The study findings indicated that Cordyceps and its bioactive components, including adenosine, cordycepin, mannitol, polysaccharide, and protein, have the potential to protect against CI/RI and MI/RI by improving blood perfusion, mitigating damage from reactive oxygen species, suppressing inflammation, preventing cellular apoptosis, and promoting tissue regeneration. Individually, Cordyceps could reduce neuronal excitatory toxicity and blood-brain barrier damage caused by cerebral ischemia. It can also significantly improve cardiac energy metabolism disorders and inhibit calcium overload caused by myocardial ischemia. Additionally, Cordyceps exerts a significant preventive or curative influence on the factors responsible for heart/brain ischemia, including hypertension, thrombosis, atherosclerosis, and arrhythmia. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates Cordyceps' prospective efficacy and safety in the prevention or treatment of CI/RI and MI/RI, providing novel insights for managing ischemic CCVDs.",

However, its therapeutic effects and pharmacological mechanisms have not been fully explored. In this study, we integrated meta-analysis and network pharmacology to provide scientific evidence for the efficacy and pharmacological mechanism of Bailing Capsule in treating CKD. We conducted searches for randomized controlled studies matching the topic in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, and the Wanfang Database, and screened them according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Dates from the included studies were extracted for meta-analysis, including renal function indicators, such as 24-h urinary protein (24UP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine (Scr), as well as inflammatory indicators like high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Network pharmacology was employed to extract biological information, including active drug ingredients and potential targets of the drugs and diseases, for network construction and gene enrichment. Our findings indicated that 24UP, BUN, and Scr in the treatment group containing Bailing Capsule were lower than those in the control group. In terms of inflammatory indicators, hs-CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α, the treatment group containing Bailing Capsule also exhibited lower levels than the control group. Based on network pharmacology analysis, we identified 190 common targets of Bailing Capsule and CKD. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses suggested that the pharmacological mechanism of Bailing Capsule might be related to immune response, inflammatory response, vascular endothelial damage, cell proliferation, and fibrosis. This demonstrates that Bailing Capsule can exert therapeutic effects through multiple targets and pathways, providing a theoretical basis for its use."

Our results revealed differences in monosaccharide composition and surface structure among CFIPs, CMIPs, and CFEPs. The molar ratios of glucose to mannose in CFIPs, glucose to xylose in CMIPs, and xylose to glucose in CFEPs were 7.57: 1.6, 7.26: 1.81, and 5.44: 2.98 respectively.

CD4+, CD8+ cells, intestinal inflammation, and intestinal barrier function in MRL/lpr mice were measured by flow cytometry, 16S ribosomal RNA, western blot, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR. KEY FINDINGS: The results showed that after the intervention of WCP, the content of CD4+ cells in lupus mice increased, and the levels of proinflammatory cytokines were down-regulated, such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6. Secondly, WCP up-regulated the proteins and mRNA levels of ZO-1, Claudin-1, and Occludin. Thirdly, it also increased the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and the abundance of Oscillospirales, Lachnospirales, Lachnospiraceae, and Clostridia, as well as negatively regulated the MAPK/NF-кB signaling pathway in lupus nephritis (LN) mice.

      "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with immune cell activation and inflammation. However, the putative pathogenic mechanisms of this injury have not been thoroughly investigated. Natural killer (NK) cells play an important role in immune regulation; however, whether NK cells regulate AKI remains unclear. Cordyceps sinensis (CS), a modern Chinese patented medicine preparation, has been widely used in treating patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) owing to its anti-inflammatory effects and maintenance of immune homeostasis. Whether 2'-deoxyadenosine, a major active component in CS, can ameliorate renal AKI by regulating immunity, particularly in NK cells, has not been reported. This study is the first to demonstrate how NK cells promote AKI by releasing perforin, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and other inflammatory factors in vivo and in vitro. Differential gene expression between AKI and normal tissues was assessed using bioinformatic analyses. Quantitative real-time PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemical staining were used to detect target protein mRNA and protein expression. Levels of inflammatory factors were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We found the high doses of the 2'-deoxyadenosine treatment significantly alleviated FA-induced renal damage in vivo, and alleviated the NK cells of renal injury by activating the STING/IRF3 pathway to inhibit perforin release in vitro. The results showed that 2'-deoxyadenosine could mitigate AKI by downregulating the activity of NK cells (by decreasing the expressions of perforin and IFN-γ) and inhibiting the stimulator of interferon genes and phosphorylated IFN regulatory factor 3. This may provide valuable evidence supporting the clinical use of CS in treating patients with AKI.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cordyceps sinensis (CS) is a fungus parasitic on lepidopteran larvae which is often used to treat lung diseases and regulate immune function. AIM OF THE STUDY: This review aimed to evaluate the efficacy of CS in the adjuvant treatment of lung cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: As of June 2022, the electronic database search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database and China Science Journal Database (VIP database). Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that evaluated the efficacy of CS as an adjuvant treatment for lung cancer were included. After the quality evaluation, meta-analysis was performed with Stata 16.0 software. RESULTS: A total of 12 RCTs with 928 patients were identified for this meta-analysis, which showed that as an adjuvant treatment, CS has the following advantages in the treatment of lung cancer: (1) Improved tumor response rate (TRR) (RR: 1.17， 95%CI: 1.05-1.29，P = 0.00); (2) improved immune function, including increased CD4 (MD: 4.98, 95%CI: 1.49-8.47, P = 0.01), CD8 (MD: 1.60, 95%CI: 0.40-2.81, P = 0.01, I2 = 0.00%), NK (MD: 4.17, 95%CI: 2.26-6.08, P = 0.00), IgA (MD: 1.29, 95%CI: 0.35-2.24, P = 0.01), IgG (MD: 3.95, 95%CI: 0.98-6.92, P = 0.01) and IgM (MD: 6.44, 95%CI: 0.63-12.26, P = 0.03); (3) improved patients' quality of life based on the mean ± SD of Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) (MD: 8.20, 95%CI: 6.87-9.53, P = 0.00); (4) reduced the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), including the incidence of myelosuppression (RR: 0.38, 95%CI: 0.19-0.75, P = 0.01), leukopenia (RR: 0.76, 95%CI: 0.63-0.92, P = 0.00), and thrombocytopenia (RR: 0.52, 95%CI: 0.31-0.86, P = 0.01) (5) reduced the incidence of radiation pneumonitis (RR: 0.74, 95%CI: 0.62-0.88, P = 0.00). However, the number of improved patients based on KPS (RR: 1.47, 95%CI: 0.98-2.20, P = 0.06) were similar between two groups, liver and renal damage (RR: 0.32, 95%CI: 0.09-1.10, P = 0.07) and gastrointestinal adverse reactions (RR: 0.80, 95%CI: 0.47-1.37, P = 0.42) as well. Subgroup analysis showed that CS could increase the TRR in the treatment with 6 g/d and 21 days/3-4 cycles. CONCLUSION: Compared with conventional treatment, adjuvant treatment with CS of lung cancer not only improve TRR, QOL and immune function, but also reduce the incidence of ADRs and radiation pneumonitis. The optimal usage may be 6 g/d and 21 days/3 to 4 cycles. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NO: CRD42022333681.",

Cordyceps militaris strains TN (mating type genes MAT1-1-1, MAT1-1-2, and MAT1-2-1) and CmFRQ-454 (mating type genes MAT1-1-1 and MAT1-1-2) were treated with non-lethal doses of fungicides amphotericin B, L-cysteine, terbinafine, and 5-fluorocytosine. The results showed that the treatment with amphotericin B, terbinafine, and 5-fluorocytosine promoted an increase in the relative content of clock protein CmFRQ (C. militaris FREQUENCY) in the mycelium of strain TN, while the high concentration of L-cysteine inhibited the expression of CmFRQ in strain TN. These four fungicides could reduce the relative contents of CmFRQ in the mycelium of strain CmFRQ454. The relative contents of CmFRQ in the mycelium of strain TN were increased after removing the four fungicides, but the relative contents of CmFRQ in the mycelium of strain CmFRQ454 were decreased after removing the four fungicides. This indicates that the effect of fungicides on CmFRQ on mycelium was still sustained after removing the stress of fungicides, and the operation of the circadian clock was changed. The fruiting bodies of C. militaris strain TN and CmFRQ-454 were still degenerated to varying degrees after removing amphotericin B, L-cysteine, and terbinafine. However, the fruiting bodies of strain TN after removing 5-fluorocytosine did not show significant degeneration; the fruiting bodies of strain CmFRQ-454 after removing 5-fluorocytosine obtained rejuvenation. These results indicate that the stress of fungicides could lead to the degeneration of fruiting bodies as well as the rejuvenation of fruiting bodies, resulting in the morphological diversity of C. militaris. The increase or decrease of the CmFRQ-454, the main component of the circadian clock, caused by the stress of fungicants, might lead to the differential degeneration of different mating-type strains of C. militaris."

Throughout history, individuals have sought natural remedies with minimal side effects as an appealing substitute for chemotherapeutic drugs. One such remedy is Cordyceps militaris, a renowned medicinal mushroom deeply entrenched in Asian ethnomedicine. Revered for its rejuvenating and curative attributes, it relied upon for ages. OBJECTIVE: The mushroom's soaring demand outpaced natural availability, necessitating controlled laboratory cultivation as the core focus and exploring the potential of methanolic extracts from harvested Cordyceps militaris fruiting bodies against Dalton's Lymphoma Ascites (DLA) cells in vitro, with a specific emphasis on its anticancer traits. METHODS: For cultivation, we employed a diverse range of rice substrates, among which bora rice showed promising growth of C. militaris fruiting bodies. To assess DLA cell cytotoxicity, several assays, including trypan blue exclusion assay, MTT assay, and LDH assay, were employed at different time points (24-96 h), which provided valuable insights on DLA cell viability and proliferation, shedding light on its therapeutic potential against cancer. RESULTS: Our studies unveiled that methanolic extract prompts apoptosis in DLA cells via AO/EB dual staining, manifesting consistent apoptosis indicators such as membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, nuclei fragmentation, and cellular shrinkage at 48-96 h of treatment. Furthermore, these striking repercussions of apoptosis were comprehended by an in silico approach having molecular docking simulation against antiapoptotic proteins like BCL-2, BCL-XL, MCL-1, BFL-1 & HSP100. CONCLUSION: Methanolic C. militaris extracts exhibited cytotoxicity and apoptotic alterations in DLA cells.",

The purpose of this research was to investigate Cordyceps cicadae as a potential therapeutic target for treating inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, and fibrosis in LN. METHODS: The effects of C. cicadae on lupus symptoms in mice with LN were determined. MRL/lpr mice were treated with C. cicadae (4 g/kg/day, i.e., CC group, n = 8) or an equal volume of saline (model group, n = 8), and MRL/MP mice were treated with an equal volume of saline (control group, n = 8). Renal function indices, renal pathology, inflammatory markers, oxidative stress markers, and renal interstitial fibrosis levels were evaluated after C. cicadae treatment. Western blot analysis was performed to investigate the effect of C. cicadae on the expression of fibrosis biomarkers and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-mediated autophagy pathway in the renal tissues of mice. RESULTS: C. cicadae ameliorated renal lesions, the inflammatory response, and oxidative stress damage in MRL/lpr mice. C. cicadae treatment inhibited renal fibrosis (16.31 ± 4.16 vs. 31.25 ± 5.61) and downregulated the expression of the fibrosis biomarkers alpha-smooth muscle actin, fibronectin, and collagen I (COL I) in the kidneys of MRL/lpr mice. In addition, further research showed that the PI3K/mTOR-mediated autophagy pathway was involved in C. cicadae-mediated effects on renal fibrosis in MRL/lpr mice. Furthermore, the therapeutic effect of C. cicadae on repairing renal fibrosis and damage in MRL/lpr mice was abolished by the PI3K agonist 740 Y-P. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present research showed that C. cicadae could alleviate inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, and fibrosis in the renal tissues of mice with LN by targeting the PI3K/mTOR-mediated autophagy pathway.",

      "abstract": "Cordyceps, also known as \"zombie fungus\", is a non-poisonous mushroom that parasitizes insects for growth and development by manipulating the host system in a way that makes the victim behave like a \"zombie\". These species produce promising bioactive metabolites, like adenosine, β-glucans, cordycepin, and ergosterol. Cordyceps has been used in traditional medicine due to its immense health benefits, as it boosts stamina, appetite, immunity, longevity, libido, memory, and sleep. Neuronal loss is the typical feature of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) (Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)) and neurotrauma. Both these conditions share common pathophysiological features, like oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and glutamatergic excitotoxicity. Cordyceps bioactives (adenosine, N6-(2-hydroxyethyl)-adenosine, ergosta-7, 9 (11), 22-trien-3β-ol, active peptides, and polysaccharides) exert potential antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic activities and display beneficial effects in the management and/or treatment of neurodegenerative disorders in vitro and in vivo. Although a considerable list of compounds is available from Cordyceps, only a few have been evaluated for their neuroprotective potential and still lack information for clinical trials. In this review, the neuroprotective mechanisms and safety profile of Cordyceps extracts/bioactives have been discussed, which might be helpful in the identification of novel potential therapeutic entities in the future.",

It has attracted commercial interest due to its immense pharmacological importance beneficial to human health. In this study, the contents of cordycepin and its derivatives, like adenine and adenosine, were evaluated through solid-state fermentation using combinations of various grains as substrate. Treatment with grain combination numbers 2, 7, 8, and 9 exhibited higher cordycepin content (1.621, 1.929, 1.895, and 1.996 mg/g cordycepin, respectively) than control (rice). The grain combination number 7 exhibited significantly higher adenine content (700 mg/g) than the control and all other combinations. Treatments with grain combination numbers 2, 5, and 7 exhibited higher adenosine content (2.719, 2.938, and 3.392 mg/g, respectively); however, no significant increase in adenosine content was noted in any treatments. The biomass including fresh mycelium and fruit body was found higher in grain combination numbers 7 and 9, leading to enhanced cordycepin content. Overall, the increase in the fresh biomass significantly enhanced cordycepin accumulation. The level of cordycepin was recorded as higher than that of its derivatives, adenosine and adenine. The grain combination of rice, wheat, jowar, bajra, and sugarcane bagasse added to basal medium exhibited the highest cordycepin content and was found suitable for solid-state fermentation of Cordyceps militaris. To our understanding, the present study is the first to use combinations of cereals for the production of cordycepin from C. militaris.",

      "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic and recurrent inflammatory disease with an unknown pathogenesis and increasing incidence. The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of prophylactic treatment with Cordyceps militaris on UC. The findings demonstrate that prophylactic supplementation of C. militaris powder effectively mitigates disease symptoms in DSS-injured mice, while also reducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, C. militaris powder enhances the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier by up-regulating MUC2 protein expression and improving tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin, and claudin 1) in DSS-injured mice. Multiomics integration analyses revealed that C. militaris powder not only reshaped gut microbiota composition, with an increase in Lactobacillus, Odoribacter, and Mucispirillum, but also exerted regulatory effects on various metabolic pathways including amino acid, glyoxylates, dicarboxylates, glycerophospholipids, and arachidonic acid. Subsequent analysis further elucidated the intricate interplay of gut microbiota, the intestinal mucosal barrier, and metabolites, suggesting that the microbiota-metabolite axis may involve the effect of C. militaris on intestinal mucosal barrier repair in UC. Moreover, in vitro experiments demonstrated that peptides and polysaccharides, derived from C. militaris, exerted an ability to change the gut microbiota structure of UC patients' feces, particularly by promoting the growth of Lactobacillus. These findings suggest that regulatory properties of C. militaris on gut microbiota may underlie the potential mechanism responsible for the protective effect of C. militaris in UC. Consequently, our study will provide support for the utilization of C. militaris as a whole food-based ingredient against the occurrence and development of UC.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a chronic kidney disease that develops in patients with diabetes mellitus. Cordycepin (CRD), a secondary metabolite produced by Cordyceps militaris, has a variety of bioactive properties. In this study, DN mice and high glucose (HG)-treated HK-2 were used to evaluate the diagnostic value of CRD. METHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), western blotting, immunofluorescence analysis, and immunohistochemical staining were used to assess changes in mRNA and protein expression. Oxidative stress was evaluated by detecting the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the activity of antioxidant enzymes. Cell apoptosis was detected by the TUNEL and flow cytometric methods. The interaction of miR-193b-5p and myeloid leukemia 1 (MCL-1) was examined by bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay. The protective effects of CRD on DN mice were evaluated by examining DN related biochemical indicators and renal histopathology. RESULTS: In response to HG, the level of miR-193b-5p was elevated, whilst the level of MCL-1 was downregulated, and CRD therapy reversed this behavior. MCL-1 was further identified to be miR-193b-5p target. CRD attenuated HG-induced cell damage, inflammation and abnormal energy metabolism. Mechanistic investigations on in vitro models confirmed that protective effect of CRD against HG challenge to HK-2 cells is mediated through the regulation of expression of miR-193b-5p/MCL-1 axis. By examining DN related biochemical markers and renal histopathology, the protective effects of CRD on DN mice was assessed. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, CRD decreased oxidative stress and inflammation by increasing miR-193b-5p and inactivating downstream MCL-1 in DN, hinting the pivotal values of CRD and miR-193b-5p in the management of DN."

Until now, there has been no effective treatment for the disease due to the complexity of pathogenesis. Fermented cordyceps powder (FCP) has a similar effect to natural cordyceps in tonifying the lung and kidney. It has started to be used in the adjuvant treatment of silicosis. This work aimed to verify the protective effects of FCP against silicosis, and to explore the related mechanism. METHODS: Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups including the saline-instilled group, the silica-exposed group, the silica + FCP (300 mg/kg) group and the silica + FCP (600 mg/kg) group. Silicosis rat models were constructed by intratracheal instillation of silica (50 mg). Rats in the FCP intervention groups received the corresponding dose of FCP daily by intragastric gavage. Rats were sacrificed on days 7, 28 and 56 after treatment, then samples were collected for further analysis. RESULTS: FCP intervention reduced the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the concentration of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) at days 7, 28, 56, and decreased the expression of collagen, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and fibronectin (FN) at days 28 and 56 in the lung of silicosis rats. FCP also decreased the immune response of Th1 and Th17 at days 7, 28, 56 and inhibited the enhancement of the Th2 response at day 56. CONCLUSIONS: FCP intervention could alleviate silica-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, the protective effect may be achieved by reducing Th1 and Th17 immune responses and inhibiting the enhancement of the Th2 response."

      "abstract": "Tetranychus urticae is an important pest worldwide. The auto-dissemination of spores of entomopathogenic fungi from an infected individual to conspecifics may be important for controlling pests that can build high populations. The current study was carried out to determine the auto-dissemination of the entomopathogenic fungus Cordyceps fumosorosea strain PFs-1 (Priority®) between T. urticae females. The study consisted of four experiments. First, the efficacy of entomopathogenic fungus bioassays was assessed in Petri dishes (experiment 1) and on potted bean plants (experiment 2). In the auto-dissemination trials (experiments 3 and 4, in Petri dishes and on potted plants, respectively), contaminated adult females (1-5) were released among uncontaminated females (10 individuals). All experiments were carried out separately, and observations were made on days 3, 5, and 7. In exp. 1, the control was different from Priority on all observation days. In exp. 2, the average number of surviving individuals in the control was significantly higher than in the Priority treatment. In the auto-dissemination experiments, as the number of contaminated individuals increased, the mortality rate of uncontaminated individuals also increased, in exp. 3 (Petri dishes) on all observation days, and in exp. 4 (potted plants) only on days 5 and 7. The median lethal time (LT50) decreased as the number of individuals contaminated with Priority increased in both Petri dish and pot trials. Consequently, the effectiveness of biological control may increase with the occurrence of indirect contamination from infected to uncontaminated individuals.",

      "abstract": "Background/objective Cordyceps enhances animal survival against influenza by boosting the immune system. In animal studies, it also had anti-inflammatory and preventive properties. Cordyceps stimulates the immune system by increasing the activity and production of various immune cells. Some studies have shown the role of Cordyceps in the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to other respiratory diseases caused by the Picorna viruses, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and Influenza viruses. However, it remains unknown whether this food supplement is safe and has anti-inflammatory effects in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the use and efficacy of Cordyceps capsules as an adjunct to standard treatment in patients with mild (symptomatic) to moderate COVID-19 infection. Methods A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cordyceps capsules (a food supplement) 500 mg as adjuvant therapy in patients with COVID-19. The rationale for dose selection was as per the existing evidence from toxicity studies. The inclusion criteria were patients with either a mild or moderate COVID-19 infection. Clinical features suggestive of dyspnoea or hypoxia, fever, and cough, including SpO2 <94% (range 90-94%) on room air and a respiratory rate ≥24 per minute, were also included. Results Sixty-five patients were recruited for the study, with 33 in the Cordyceps group and 32 in the placebo group. Out of 58 evaluable patients, 33 recovered on day 5, 49 on day 10, and 58 on days 16 and 30. The recovery of patients steadily increased from 56.9% on day 5 to 100% on day 30. The time to clinical recovery was shorter in the Cordyceps group than in the placebo group (mean 6.6 vs. 7.3 days; p > 0.05) overall and for mild disease. However, there was no difference in the time to recovery (time from day 1 to the resolution of all symptoms) for moderate disease. A lower frequency of normal chest X-rays on day 1 and a higher number on day 16 in the treatment group than in the placebo group suggest an improvement in the number of normal chest X-rays with Cordyceps. Significant changes were seen in biomarkers MCPIP, CxCL10, and IL-1β for overall (both mild and moderate patients) on days 5 and 10 as compared to baseline, and in biomarkers CRP and CxCL10 in moderate category patients on days 5 and 10, respectively. There were no statistically significant changes in IL-6, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), or D-dimer levels between baseline and day 5/10 in patients taking Cordyceps capsules and also between the treatment and placebo groups. Conclusion Cordyceps capsules administered at a dose of 500 mg three times a day along with supportive treatment showed effectiveness in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 infection, as evidenced by the proportionately higher number of recoveries on day 5, the relatively shorter time for improvement of clinical symptoms, and the proportionately higher number of patients showing negative RT-PCR tests on day 10. Thus, Cordyceps appears to be a safe immunological adjuvant for the treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Future studies with a larger sample size would shed more light on the evidence, as there are limitations in the generalizability of the results from the present study due to the small sample size."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Candida albicans is the most prevalent fungal pathogen, affecting over 75% of women who have experienced candidal vaginitis. Given the identification of drug-resistant C. albicans strains, there is an urgent need to develop therapeutic methods for treating vaginal Candida infection. Polysaccharide is the major bioactive component of Cordyceps militaris, known to modulate immune responses and alleviate inflammation. Sesame oil is known with anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory activities. METHODS: C. militaris polysaccharide was prepared and formulated with sesame oil to prepare emulsion and nanoemulsion, which are ideal mucosal delivery systems for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic compounds concurrently. The physical property and storage stability of these formulations were illustrated, and their effects on ameliorating vaginitis were investigated in a murine model of vaginal Candida infection. RESULTS: C. militaris polysaccharide-containing nanoemulsion showed smaller particle size, lower polydispersity index, higher zeta-potential and better stability than emulsion. Intravaginal administration of C. militaris polysaccharide-containing nanoemulsion significantly attenuated C. militaris colonization and vaginitis. Notably, these formulations exerted distinct effects on modulating cell infiltration and splenic cytokine production. Moreover, different profile of vaginal microflora was observed among the treatment groups, revealing the potential action mechanisms of these formulations to mitigate vaginal Candida infection. CONCLUSION: C. militaris polysaccharide- and sesame oil-containing nanoemulsion is potential to be developed as intravaginal therapeutic strategy for C. albicans-induced vaginitis."

The post-application persistence and efficacy of this fungus against B. tabaci were compared with that of the commercially available C. javanica Apopka97 strain over a two-year field study in cotton and vegetable crops. When blastospores of both strains were applied alone, whitefly populations were not effectively suppressed. Thus, JMS stylet oil was added to fungal treatments for enhancing efficacy and persistence. For 0-day samples, all fungal treatments caused similar but significant levels of immature mortality regardless of fungal strain, propagule form (conidia vs. blastospores), and application method (alone or mixed with JMS). In follow-up samplings, Wf GA17 blastospores + JMS achieved higher control levels than other treatments in some trials, but the efficacy did not last long. The JMS oil alone caused significant mortality and suppressed whiteflies. Over 90% of spores lost viability 24 h after treatment in all fungal treatments. Across evaluation times, there was no difference between the two fungal strains (conidia or blastospores, alone or combined with JMS), but conidia persisted better than blastospores for both strains. Overall, the field persistence and efficacy of C. javanica did not last long; therefore, improved delivery methods and formulations are needed for enhancement."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The polysaccharides found in Cordyceps cicadae (C. cicadae) have received increasing academic attention owing to their wide variety of therapeutic activities. METHODS: This study evaluated the hypoglycemic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects of polysaccharides from C. cicadae (CH-P). In addition, 16s rDNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) were used to estimate the changes and regulatory relationships between gut microbiota and its metabolites. The fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was used to verify the therapeutic effects of microbial remodeling. RESULTS: The results showed that CH-P treatment displayed hypoglycemic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects and alleviated tissue damage induced by diabetes. The CH-P treatment significantly reduced the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and increased the abundance of Bacteroides, Odoribacter, Alloprevotella, Parabacteroides, Mucispirillum, and significantly decreased the abundance of Helicobacter and Lactobacillus compared to the diabetic group. The alterations in the metabolic pathways were mostly related to amino acid biosynthesis and metabolic pathways (particularly those involving tryptophan) according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. Correlation analysis showed that Bacteroides, Odoribacter, Alloprevotella, Parabacteroides, and Mucispirillum were positively correlated with indole and its derivatives, such as 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid. Indole intervention significantly improved hyperglycemic symptoms and insulin sensitivity, and increased the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in diabetic mice. FMT reduced blood glucose levels, improved glucose tolerance, and increased insulin sensitivity in diabetic mice. However, FMT did not significantly improve GLP-1 levels. DISCUSSION: This indicates that C. cicadae polysaccharides alleviate hyperglycemia by regulating the production of metabolites other than indole and its derivatives by gut microbiota. This study provides an important reference for the development of novel natural products."

      "abstract": "Cordyceps extract and withaferin A (Wi-A) are natural compounds that have therapeutic effects on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, their efficacy is limited and a long treatment duration is usually required. To enhance their efficiency, the synergistic effects of nanobubble water (NBW) derived from nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen gases were investigated. Results showed that the physical properties of all three NBWs, including nanobubble density (108 particles/mL) and zeta potential (below -22 mV), were stable during 48 h of storage. Hydrogen and nitrogen NBWs did not reduce, but instead promoted, free fatty acid-induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. In contrast, oxygen NBW synergistically enhanced the effects of cordyceps extract and Wi-A. The lipid content decreased by 29% and 33% in the oxygen NBW + cordyceps extract and oxygen NBW + Wi-A groups, respectively, compared to reductions of 22% and 16% by aqueous extracts without NB. This study found that NBW may enhance the lipid-reducing effects of natural compounds, such as cordyceps extract and withaferin A, in hepatic cells. Further studies in animal experiments are needed to determine whether NBW has a potential application in NAFLD."

      "abstract": "Since the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, researchers have been working on figuring out ways to tackle multi-organ failure and hyperinflation, which are brought on by a cytokine storm. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein's cellular receptor, is involved in complicated molecular processes that result in hyperinflammation. Cordyceps militaris is one of the traditional Chinese medicines that is used as an immune booster, and it has exhibited efficacy in lowering blood glucose levels, seminal emissions, and infertility. In the current study, we explored the potential of Cordyceps militaris steroids as key agents in managing the anger of cytokine storm in Covid-19 using network ethnopharmacological techniques and structure-based drug designing approaches. The steroids present in Cordyceps militaris were initially screened against the targets involved in inflammatory pathways. The results revealed that out of 16 steroids, 5 may be effective against 17 inflammatory pathways by targeting 11 pathological proteins. Among the five steroids, beta-sitosterol, Cholest-5-en-3β-ol, 3β, and 7α-Dihydroxycholest-5-ene were found to interact with thrombin (F2), an important protein reported to reduce the severity of inflammatory mediators and Cholest-4-en-3-one was found to target Glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1). The top docked steroid displayed key interactions with both targets, which retained key interactions throughout the 100 ns simulation period. These compounds were also shown high binding free energy scores in water swap studies. Based on obtained results the current study suggests the use of Cordyceps militaris as an add-on therapy that may reduce the progression of inflammatory co-morbidities among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been shown to be an important mechanism involved in renal fibrosis. Cordyceps sinensis, a traditional Chinese medicine, has long been used for the treatment of renal fibrosis. As research on the mycelium of C. sinensis progressed, a variety of medicines developed from fermented mycelium were used to treat CKD. However, their efficacies and mechanisms have not been fully summarized. In this review, five medicines developed from fermented mycelium of C. sinensis are presented. The pharmacodynamic effects of C. sinensis on different animal models of renal fibrosis are summarized. The in vitro studies and related mechanisms of C. sinensis on renal cells are detailed. Finally, the application and efficacy of these five commercial medicines that meet national standards in different types of CKD are summarized. From this review, it can be concluded that C. sinensis can alleviate various causes of renal fibrosis to some extent, and its mechanism is related to TGF-β1 dependent signaling, inhibition of inflammation, and improvement of renal function. Further research on rigorously designed, large-sample, clinically randomized controlled trial studies and detailed mechanisms should be conducted."

METHODS: Sixteen BALB/c mice bearing subcutaneous human tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) TCA-8113 cell xenografts were randomized into model group and cordycepin treatment group for daily treatment with saline and cordycepin for 4 weeks. After the treatment, the tumor xenografts were dissected and weighed to assess the tumor inhibition rate. Histological changes in the heart, spleen, liver, kidney, and lung of the mice were evaluated with HE staining, and tumor cell apoptosis was examined using TUNEL staining; The expressions of Bax, Bcl-2, GRP78, CHOP, and caspase-12 in the xenografts were detected using RT-qPCR and Western blotting. RESULTS: Cordycepin treatment resulted in a tumor inhibition rate of 56.09% in the nude mouse models, induced obvious changes in tumor cell morphology and significantly enhanced apoptotic death of the tumor cells without causing pathological changes in the vital organs. Cordycepin treatment also significantly reduced Bcl-2 expression (P < 0.05) and increased Bax, GRP78, CHOP, and caspase-12 expressions at both the RNA and protein levels in the tumor tissues.

      "abstract": "Cordyceps cicadae (Miq.) is an edible fungus with unique and valuable medicinal properties that is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine, but its anti-aging effects on the skin fibroblast are not well studied. The aim of the present study was to analyze the active components of aqueous C. cicadae extract (CCE), determine the effects of CCE on hyaluronan synthesis in human skin fibroblasts, and explore the underlying mechanisms. The results of this study indicate that CCE was rich in polysaccharides, five alditols (mainly mannitol), eight nucleosides, protein, and polyphenols, which were present at concentrations of 62.7, 110, 8.26, 35.7, and 3.8 mg/g, respectively. The concentration of extract required to inhibit 50% of 2,2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazo-line-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazil (DPPH) radical scavenging capacities were 0.36 ± 0.03 and 4.54 ± 0.10 mg/mL, respectively, indicating that CCE exhibits excellent antioxidant activities. CCE showed no cytotoxicity to skin fibroblasts at concentrations ≤ 100 μg/mL, and promoted HA synthesis in fibroblasts. Treatment of fibroblast cells with 100 μg/mL CCE enhances the HA content to 1293 ± 142 ng/mL, which is significantly more than that in the non-treatment (NT) group (p = 0.0067). Further, RNA sequencing detected 1,192 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in CCE-treated fibroblasts, among which 417 were upregulated and 775 were downregulated. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes (KEGG) and Genomes pathway (GO) analysis based on RNA sequencing revealed that CCE mainly affected cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction regulated by HA synthesis-related genes. CCE upregulated HA synthase 2 (HAS2), epidermal growth factor (EGF)-related genes, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor, C-C motif chemokine ligand 2, interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 2, and other genes related to fibroblast differentiation and proliferation. CCE downregulated the gene of matrix metallopeptidase 12 (MMP12), which leads to cell matrix loss. RT-qPCR further verified CCE significantly upregulated HAS2 expression and significantly downregulated MMP12 expression, thus promoting hyaluronan synthesis. CCE shows potential as a moisturizer and anti-aging agent in functional foods and cosmetics.",

This study was carried out at the poultry farm of the Animal Production Department, College of Agriculture, University of Anbar, Ramadi, Iraq from 28/10/2021 to 8/12/2021 (42 days), to show the effect of the addition of Cordyceps sinensis extract and a probiotic to the diet of broilers on their productive performance. For this purpose, 210 one-day-old unsexed chicks of strain (Ross 308) were used with an average weight of 40 g. They were randomly divided into seven groups of treatments, and each treatment had three replicates (10 chicks per replicate). The treatments included T1, which was the control group without any addition to the diet, T2 and T3 with the addition of C. sinensis extract at a level of 300 and 600 mg/kg feed, respectively, T4 and T5 with the addition of a probiotic at the level of 3 and 6 g/kg feed, respectively, T6 with the addition of C. sinensis extract at a level of 300 mg/kg feed + the probiotic at a level of 3 g/kg feed, T7 with the addition of C. sinensis extract at a level of 600 mg/kg feed + the probiotic at a level of 3 g/kg fodder and 6 g/kg feed. The results showed a significant superiority (P≤0.05) in favor of the T6 and T7 treatments, which included the mixture of C. sinensis extract and the probiotic, in terms of the average body weight at the sixth week, over the rest of the treatments except for the T3 treatment which included the addition of C. sinensis extract at a level of 600 mg/kg feed. Regarding weight increase, the T3 treatment, which included the addition of . sinensis extract at a level of 600 mg/kg feed, was significantly superior (P≤0.05) to the T4 treatment, which included the addition of the booster at a level of 3 g/kg feed. Regarding the feed consumption rate, it was observed that all the added treatments significantly decreased it (P≤0.05), compared to the control T1 and the cumulative feed conversion factor (0-6 weeks). It was noticed that the treatments of the mixture T6 and T7 led to a significant (P≤0.05) improvement, compared to the other experimental treatments. It is concluded from this that the addition that C. sinensis extract and the probiotic improved the productive performance of broilers without any adverse effects.",

Firstly, cholesterol- and vitamin E-grafted PGA polymers (PGA-CH and PGA-VE, respectively) were fabricated, with and without maleimide-ended polyethylene glycol. Subsequently, CME, which contained an active cordycepin equaling 9.89% of its weight, was encapsulated in the LPNPs. The results revealed that the synthesized polymers could be used to prepare CME-loaded LPNPs. The LPNP formulations containing Mal-PEG were decorated with cysteine-grafted HYA via thiol-maleimide reactions. The HYA-decorated PGA-based LPNPs substantially enhanced the anticancer effect of CME against MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells by enhancing cellular uptake through CD44 receptor-mediated endocytosis. This study demonstrated the successful targeted delivery of CME to the CD44 receptors of tumor cells by HYA-conjugated PGA-based LPNPs and the new application of synthesized PGA-CH- and PGA-VE-based polymers in LPNP preparation. The developed LPNPs showed promising potential for the targeted delivery of herbal extracts for cancer treatment and clear potential for translation in in vivo experiments."

Polysaccharides extracted from Cordyceps sinensis, the fugus of Cordyceps, have been reported to have anti-cancer properties. Thus, we speculated that polysaccharides might be the key anti-tumor active ingredients of Cordyceps because of their larger molecular weight than that of polysaccharides in Cordyceps sinensis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of wild Cordyceps polysaccharides on H22 liver cancer and the underlying mechanism. The structural characteristics of the polysaccharides of WCP were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography, high-performance gel-permeation chromatography, Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry, and scanning electron microscopy. Additionally, H22 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice were used to explore the anti-tumor effect of WCP (100 and 300 mg/kg/d). The mechanism by WCP inhibited H22 tumors was uncovered by the TUNEL assay, flow cytometry, hematoxylin-eosin staining, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and Western blotting. Here, our results showed that WCP presented high purity with an average molecular weight of 2.1 × 106 Da and 2.19 × 104 Da. WCP was determined to be composed of mannose, glucose, and galactose. Notably, WCP could inhibit the proliferation of H22 tumors not only by improving immune function, but also by promoting the apoptosis of tumor cells, likely through the IL-10/STAT3/Bcl2 and Cyto-c/Caspase8/3 signaling pathways, in H22 tumor-bearing mice. Particularly, WCP had essentially no side effects compared to 5-FU, a common drug used in the treatment of liver cancer. In conclusion, WCP could be a potential anti-tumor product with strong regulatory effects in H22 liver cancer.",

It contains a lot of bioactive compounds that are beneficial to our health. However, during artificial cultivation, strain degeneration is a challenge that inhibits the industrialization utility of C. militaris. Exogenous melatonin (MT) can scavenge for reactive oxygen species (ROS) in fungus and can alleviate strain degeneration. To establish the significance and molecular mechanisms of MT on strain degeneration, we investigated the third-generation strain (W5-3) of C. militaris via morphological, biochemical, and transcriptomic approaches under MT treatment. Morphological analyses revealed that colony angulation of C. militaris was significantly weakened, and the aerial hypha was reduced by 60 μmol L-1 MT treatment. Biochemical analyses showed low levels of ROS and malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as increasing endogenous MT levels as exogenous MT increased. RNA-Seq revealed that compared with the control, several antioxidant enzyme-related genes were up-regulated under 60 μmol L-1 MT treatment. Among them, glutathione s-transferase genes were up-regulated by a factor of 11.04. In addition, genes that are potentially involved in cordycepin, adenosine and active compound biosynthesis for the growth and development of mycelium were up-regulated. Collectively, these findings provide the basis for further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms involved in C. militaris strain degeneration."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) has mainly been considered as a glomerular disease. Our previous study showed that the progression of DKD was highly correlated with the dysfunction of renal proximal tubular cells. Fermented Cordyceps sinensis (CS), a substitute for natural CS, is a prominent herb widely used in China, and has exhibited excellent efficacy on DKD. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. METHODS: The database analysis was used to identify the main therapeutic targets and pathways of CS involved in DKD treatment. Next, the protective effects of fermented CS on high glucose (HG, 30 mM) induced HK-2 cell injury was validated through cell proliferation and apoptosis assay, including CCK-8, EdU and TUNEL. Finally, quantitative real‑time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting were used to verify key target genes. RESULTS: Our results revealed that 9 main targets (RELA, JNK1, PTEN, VEGFA, EGF, ERK2, CASP3, AKT1, MMP9) were recognized as key therapeutic targets with excellent binding affinity screened by database analysis and molecular docking. The biological processes were identified by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment, which appeared mainly involved in the positive regulation of cell proliferation as well as the negative regulation of apoptosis. The verification experiments in vitro revealed that fermented CS significantly attenuated the HG-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis, and promoted the proliferation of HK-2 cells. Moreover, fermented CS significantly downregulated the expressions of Bax, Caspase-3, VEGFA, P-AKT and P-ERK, and upregulated the expression of PTEN compared with that of HG group. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that the fermented CS has nephroprotective effects significantly, which functions via promoting proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis of renal proximal tubular cells, likely by targeting Caspase-3, Bax, VEGFA and PTEN. Furthermore, AKT and ERK signaling pathway may be the critical mechanisms underlying the efficacy of fermented CS in DKD treatment.",

      "abstract": "Cordycepin, an important active substance in Cordyceps militaris, possesses antiviral and other beneficial activities. In addition, it has been reported to effectively promote the comprehensive treatment of COVID-19 and thus has become a research hotspot. The addition of naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) is known to significantly improve the yield of cordycepin; however, its related molecular mechanism remains unclear. We conducted a preliminary study on C. militaris with different concentrations of NAA. We found that treatment with different concentrations of NAA inhibited the growth of C. militaris, and an increase in its concentration significantly improved the cordycepin content. In addition, we conducted a transcriptome and metabolomics association analysis on C. militaris treated with NAA to understand the relevant metabolic pathway of cordycepin synthesis under NAA treatment and elucidate the relevant regulatory network of cordycepin synthesis. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), transcriptome, and metabolome association analysis revealed that genes and metabolites encoding cordycepin synthesis in the purine metabolic pathway varied significantly with the concentration of NAA. Finally, we proposed a metabolic pathway by analyzing the relationship between gene-gene and gene-metabolite regulatory networks, including the interaction of cordycepin synthesis key genes; key metabolites; purine metabolism; TCA cycle; pentose phosphate pathway; alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism; and histidine metabolism. In addition, we found the ABC transporter pathway to be significantly enriched. The ABC transporters are known to transport numerous amino acids, such as L-glutamate, and participate in the amino acid metabolism that affects the synthesis of cordycepin. Altogether, multiple channels work together to double the cordycepin yield, thereby providing an important reference for the molecular network relationship between the transcription and metabolism of cordycepin synthesis."

METHODS: Forty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups according to a random number table, including the normal saline (NS)-treated sham group (sham group), NS-treated ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) group (IRI group), and low- (5 g/kg·d) and high-dose (10 g/kg·d) CS-treated IRI groups (CS1 and CS2 groups), 12 rats in each group. Nephrectomy of the right kidney was performed on the IRI rat model that was subjected to 60 min of left renal pedicle occlusion followed by 12, 24, 48, and 72 h of reperfusion. The wet-to-dry (W/D) ratio of lung, levels of serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin- β and tumor necrosis factor- α, and biomarkers of oxidative stress such as superoxide dismutase, malonaldehyde (MDA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), were assayed. Histological examinations were conducted to determine damage of tissues in the kidney and lung. The protein expressions of light chain 3 II/light chain 3 I (LC3-II/LC3-I), uncoordinated-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1), P62, AMPK and mTOR were measured by Western blot and immunohistochemistry, respectively. RESULTS: The renal IRI induced pulmonary injury following AKI, resulting in significant increases in W/D ratio of lung, and the levels of Scr, BUN, inflammatory cytokines, MDA and MPO (P<0.01); all of these were reduced in the CS groups (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Compared with the IRI groups, the expression levels of P62 and mTOR were significantly lower (P<0.05 or P<0.01), while those of LC3-II/LC3-I, ULK1, and AMPK were significantly higher in the CS2 group (P<0.05 or P<0.01). CONCLUSION: CS had a potential in treating lung injury following renal IRI through activation of the autophagy-related AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway in AKI-induced ALI.",

AIM OF STUDY: Cordyceps proteins (CP) have a favorable bidirectional immunomodulatory functions and may have therapeutic potential for LN. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown. So this study aimed to examine the activities of CP in LN and possible mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: So proteomics was performed to detect proteins components of Cordyceps, and analysis it. In addition, MRL/lpr mice were used to study the progression of LN. The MRL/lpr mice were fed either CP (i.g, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 g/kg/d), prednisolone acetate (PA, i.g, 6 mg/kg/d), or Bailing capsule (BC, i.g, 0.75 g/kg/d) for 8 weeks. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), Periodic Acid Schif (PAS) and Masson's stainings, Immunofluorescence, and Immunohistochemistry were performed to verify the therapeutic effect of CP on MRL/lpr mice. The mechanism by CP alimerated LN was uncovered by Western blotting (WB) and Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) methods. RESULTS: Our results revealed that CP blocked proteinuria production and renal inflammatory infiltratation in MRL/lpr mice to reduce the renal fibrosis. In addition, CP worked better than BC which is artificial Cordyceps fungus powder in regulating proteinuria to urine creatinine ratio and interleukin-4(IL-4) protein amount. Especially, CP modulated the STAT3/mTOR/NF-кB signaling pathway in LN mice and brought a more pronounced lowering effect on the contents of IL-6 and IL-1β than the PA. CONCLUSION: CP could be a potential anti-inflammatory immune product with strong regulatory effects and potency than BC and PA in nephritis therapeutics.",

Herbs with bioactive compounds that have anti-oxidant effects such as cordyceps and turmeric, are of interest to clinical applications due to their minimal adverse effects. The aim of study is to develop the nanoencapsulated cordyceps and turmeric extracts and investigate their capability to enhance the biological activity and improve neuronal function. METHODS: Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were utilized as a neuronal model to investigate the properties of nanoencapsulated cordyceps or turmeric extracts, called CMP and TEP, respectively. SH-SY5Y cells were treated with either CMP or TEP and examined the biological consequences, including neuronal maturation and neuronal function. RESULTS: The results showed that both CMP and TEP improved cellular uptake efficiency within 6 h by 2.3 and 2.8 times, respectively. Besides, they were able to inhibit cellular proliferation of SH-SY5Y cells up to 153- and 218-fold changes, and increase the expression of mature neuronal markers (TUJ1, PAX6, and NESTIN). Upon the treatment of CMP and TEP, the expression of dopaminergic-specific genes (LMX1B, FOXA2, EN1, and NURR1), and the secretion level of dopamine were significantly improved up to 3.3-fold and 3.0-fold, respectively, while the expression of Alzheimer genes (PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP), and the secretion of amyloid precursor protein were significantly reduced by 32-fold and 108-fold, respectively. Importantly, the autophagy activity was upregulated by CMP and TEP at 6.3- and 5.5-fold changes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This finding suggested that the nanoencapsulated cordyceps and turmeric extracts accelerated neuronal maturation and alleviated neuronal pathology in human neural cells. This paves the way for nanotechnology-driven drug delivery systems that could potentially be used as an alternative medicine in the future for neurological diseases."

Due to the rare and expensive resources from natural habitats, artificially cultivated mycelia using submerged liquid cultivation of CC (CCM) have been recently developed as an alternative to scarce sources of CC. However, little is known regarding potential protective effects of CCM against cyclosporine A (CsA)-induced acute nephrotoxicity in vivo and in vitro. In this study, male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups: control, CCM (40 mg and 400 mg/kg, orally), CsA (10 mg/kg, oral gavage), and CsA + CCM (40 mg and 400 mg/kg, orally). At the end of the study on day 8, all rats were sacrificed, and the blood and kidneys retrieved. CsA-induced acute nephrotoxicity was evident by increased levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Levels of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident chaperone glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP 78) were increased significantly in rats with acute nephrotoxicity. BUN and GRP 78 were significantly ameliorated in synchronous oral groups of CCM (40 or 400 mg/kg) plus CsA. Examination of hematoxylin and eosin stained kidney tissues revealed that the combined treatment of CCM slightly improved vacuolization in renal tubules upon CsA-induced damage. CsA-induced down-regulation of protein expression of magnesium ion channel proteins and transient receptor potential melastatin 6 and 7 were abolished by the combined treatment of CCM. CCM has the potential to protect the kidney against CsA-induced nephrotoxicity by reducing magnesium ion wasting, tubular cell damage, and ER stress demonstrated further by human renal proximal tubular epithelial cell line HK-2. Our results contribute to the in-depth understanding of the role of polysaccharides and nucleobases as the main secondary metabolites of CCM in the defense system of renal functions in CsA-induced acute nephrotoxicity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cordyceps militaris is an edible and medicinal fungus, and its polysaccharides are among its main pharmacological components. They can display immunomodulation, anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation, anti-hypolipidemic, and other functions. The anti-obesity effect of C. militaris polysaccharides (CMP) is not yet fully understood, however. RESULTS: In this study, a CMP diet intervention was applied over a 4 week period to mice with obesity induced by a high-fat diet (HFD), followed by profiling of obesity-induced dyslipidemia, low-grade inflammation, and gut dysbiosis. The results suggested that CMP could significantly reduce HFD-induced obesity, alleviate obesity-induced hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance, and ameliorate systemic inflammation, showing a promising ability to protect mice from obesity. Further analyses revealed that CMP could regulate obesity-induced gut dysbiosis by restoring the phylogenetic diversity of gut microbiota. It could also increase the relative abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria, while down-regulating the level of bacteria that were positively related to the development of obesity. A correlation analysis showed that Helicobacter, Allobaculum, Clostridium XVIII, Parabacteroides, Ligilactobacillus, Faecalibaculum, Adlercreutzia, and Mediterraneibacter were positively related to obese phenotypes. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential of CMP as a prebiotic agent to protect obese individuals from metabolic disorders and gut dysbiosis. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.",

They are unique parasites of larvae of selected species of moths. Cordyceps militaris is one of the best sources of cordycepin. Worldwide, osteoporosis is one of the most common bone diseases, whose pharmacotherapy includes various medical interventions; however, the research and development of new molecules and new drugs is required. The impact of adenosine receptors (ARs) on the purinergic signaling pathway may regulate proliferation, differentiate dental pulp stem cells and bone marrow, and modulate osteogenesis and bone repair. The aim of the review was to collect and analyze the available data on the effects of Cordyceps spp. or cordycepin on bone function and related processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review in this perspective, not necessarily using mushroom raw material or even the isolated parent compound cordycepin, but new molecules that are analogs of nucleosides, such as those from C. militaris. This review found that Cordyceps spp. or isolated cordycepin interacts via the AR, 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) signaling pathway and evaluated their impact on bones, teeth, and dental pulp. Cordyceps spp. was found to have the potential to develop regenerative medicines, thus providing an opportunity to expand the treatment or intervention methods in the recovery after traumatic injuries, convalescence, and terminal-stage or devastating diseases.",

Cordyceps guangdongensis is a high-value macrofungus with broad application potential in the food and bio-medicine industry. This current study aimed to estimate the role of C. guangdongensis lipid-lowering compound formula (CGLC) in regulating fat and lipid accumulation, gut microbiota balance, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) contents, and expression levels of genes involved in fat and lipid metabolism in high-fat diet (HFD) mice. The results showed that CGLC intervention markedly reduced body weights and fat accumulation in HFD mice, improved glucose tolerance and blood lipid levels, and decreased lipid droplet accumulation and fat vacuole levels in the liver. CGLC decreased the ratio of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and increased the relative abundances of Bacteroides (B. acidifaciens) and Bifidobacterium (B. pseudolongum). In addition, CGLC treatment significantly promoted the production of SCFAs and regulated the relative expression levels of genes involved in fat and lipid metabolism in liver. Association analysis showed that several species of Bacteroides and most of SCFAs were significantly associated with serum lipid indicators. These results suggested that CGLC is a novel candidate formulation for treating obesity and non-alcohol fatty liver by regulating gut microbiota, SCFAs, and genes involved in fat and lipid metabolism."

      "abstract": "Dry eye disease (DED), a multifactorial inflammatory ocular surface disorder, affects up to 50% of individuals over 50 years old worldwide and is one of the most common reasons for seeking ophthalmologic care. Generally, topical eye drops or oral drugs are administered to treat DED; however, the use of preservatives in eye drops or the adverse effects of oral drugs are disadvantageous for long-term therapy. Cordyceps cicadae, a traditional Chinese medicinal fungus, possesses anti-inflammatory effects without evident toxicity and is obtainable at low price. Our previous study demonstrated that C. cicadae mycelium effectively ameliorates dry eye symptoms in the benzalkonium chloride (BAC)-induced mouse dry eye model by increasing tear volume and tear film breakup time (TBUT). However, the effects of C. cicadae mycelium for human dry eye amelioration remains unknown. Thus, the present study investigated the mitigation of dry eye conditions and related discomforts through oral supplementation of fermented C. cicadae mycelium. A total of 70 healthy individuals were recruited and randomly allocated to receive a daily oral dose of 1,050 mg preparation in sachet containing either freeze-dried C. cicadae mycelium powder with 0.3 mg of adenosine and 1.5 mg of HEA per gram or placebo for 90 days. The participants were subjected to anthropometric measurements, dry eye questionnaires (DEQ), Schirmer's tests, intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements, tear film breakup time (TBUT) tests, tear osmolality measurements, and tear electrolyte analysis prior to and right after completion of the study. The results showed a significantly increased TBUT as well as a significant decrease in tear osmolarity, in parallel with the decrease of tear electrolytes, especially Na+ and Cl ions. Although significant increase of tear volume was not observed, the increased TBUT suggests mitigation of dry eye through improvement of tear quality. Therefore, C. cicadae mycelium supplementation may be used for dry eye alleviation as a novel therapeutic intervention.",

Carotenoid utilization is deemed a possible strategy for treating AMD. Cordyceps militaris has advantages like immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative characteristics. This paper assessed the possible protective influence of carotenoids obtained by isolating and purifying the Cordyceps militaris (CMCT) into human RPE cells (ARPE-19) damaged by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The findings demonstrated that CMCT safeguarded the ARPE-19 cells against the damage and apoptosis caused by H2O2 and oxidative stress via Bcl-2 protein upregulation, as well as the expression of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 protein. In addition, CMCT treatment increased cell survival and restricted the generation of H2O2-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the protein expression of NADPH oxidase-1 (NOX1). Additionally, the CMCT treatment of H2O2-induced ARPE-19 cells ameliorated high malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in oxidative stress-induced cells. The catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH) returned to standard levels, which were governed by the higher expression of nuclear Nrf2 protein in the ARPE-19 cells. Moreover, this study showed that CMCT safeguarded the ARPE-19 cells against the damage caused by oxidative stress via its antioxidant activity and antiapoptotic functionality, suggesting the potential therapeutic role of CMCT in AMD prevention and mitigation."

The aim of this study was to systematically analyze and predict the potential mechanism of Cordyceps cicadae in renal IRI therapy using network pharmacology. MATERIAL AND METHODS Cordycepin, adenosine, and cordycepic acid are the 3 major medicinal ingredients in Cordyceps cicadae. Based on network pharmacology, the 3D structure of the 3 compounds were obtained, and then the common targets between these compounds and renal IRI were analyzed and determined. We used the ingredient-target (I-T), protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, the enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) to find the possible pharmacological mechanism of Cordyceps cicadae in treating renal IRI. RESULTS Through target fishing and analysis, the 3 active ingredients of Cordyceps cicadae shared 81 target genes with renal IRI. I-T network showed that adenosine had the highest degree, and 5 genes were associated with the 3 active ingredients. PPI network analysis showed that ALB, GAPDH, CASP3, MAPK1, FN1, and IL-10 play a pivotal role. The enrichment analysis of GO and KEGG showed that Cordyceps cicadae can treat renal IRI through MAPK, cAMP, PPAR, Rap1, and HIF-1 signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS Cordyceps cicadae exerts its therapeutic effect on renal IRI via multiple targets and pathways. Nevertheless, further experimentation is needed to verify this. The method of network pharmacology provides an effective method of determining the comprehensive action mechanism of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).",

Drying treatment serves as the last step in CMF industrial processes. In this work, the physicochemical properties of polysaccharides from C. militaris fruiting bodies (CMFPs) with hot air drying (HD), far-infrared radiation drying (ID) and vacuum freeze-drying (FD) treatments were analyzed, and their effects on ulcerative colitis (UC) were further investigated in oxazolone-induced zebrafish. The results showed that physicochemical properties of CMFP-H, CMFP-I and CMFP-F were obvious different. CMFPs could repair the intestinal mucosal barrier, inhibit ROS generation and the activities of MDA and MPO, and improve the activities of SOD, CAT, ACP, AKP and LZM. Further detection indicated that CMFPs could better improve UC via activating the MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway in vivo. However, CMFP-H, CMFP-F and CMFP-I exhibited diverse regulation effects on specific immune-related enzymes and cytokines. The data would be helpful for finding practical and rapid drying methods for macro-fungi and further exploring CMFPs as functional food ingredients or complementary medicines for the treatments of UC."

Cordyceps sinensis (C. sinensis) is not only a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) but also a healthy food. In China, C. sinensis has been widely used to treat various kidney diseases. Bailing Capsule, which active ingredient is C. sinensis, is approved to treat kidney disease, respiratory disease, and immune disease. However, its underlying mechanism in DN remains unclear. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the underlying mechanism of Bailing Capsule on kidney in diabetic rats. The DN model was established by streptozotocin (STZ) injection. Low and high doses of Bailing Capsule were orally administrated for 12 weeks after diabetes induction. Renal function was evaluated by serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, 24-h urinary protein, and urinary albumin. Mesangial matrix expansion and renal fibrosis were measured using histopathology staining. We found that the disorder of renal function and pathology in DN rats was significantly modified by Bailing Capsule treatment. Consistently, Bailing Capsule markedly alleviated DN rat glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial injury and renal fibrosis as shown by pathological staining. Moreover, Bailing Capsule significantly reduced the kidney triglyceride content and renal lipid droplet formation in DN rats. The renal transcriptome revealed that Bailing Capsule-treated kidneys had 498 upregulated genes and 448 downregulated genes. These differentially expressed genes were enriched in the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) pathway and fatty acid metabolism function ontology. mRNA and protein expression analyses revealed substantial enhancement of the lipolysis pathway and inhibition of lipogenesis in Bailing Capsule-treated rat kidneys compared to DN rats. Bailing Capsule activated the expression of PPARα, ACOX1 (acyl-CoA oxidase 1), and SCD (stearoyl-CoA desaturase) in diabetic nephropathy while suppressing the expression of FASN (fatty acid synthase). In conclusion, Bailing Capsule could attenuate renal triglyceride accumulation in diabetic rats by moderating PPARα pathway."

Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the effect of UV-C radiation on the physiology and gene expression level of Plutella xylostella, a destructive vegetable pest. Results showed that, after exposure to UV-C radiation for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h, the activity of SOD (superoxide dismutase) and CAT (catalase) of P. xylostella increased, while the activity of PPO (polyphenol oxidase), POD (peroxidase), AChE (acetylcholinesterase), CarE (carboxylesterase), and ACP (acid phosphatase) decreased with increased exposure time. Correlation coefficient analyses indicated that the activity of CAT correlated positively, while PPO and CarE correlated negatively, with exposure time. Gene regulation analysis via qRT-PCR confirmed a significant increase in regulation in CAT, CarE, and PPO-related genes. We also investigated the effect of UV-C exposure on the virulence of Cordyceps fumosorosea against P. xylostella. Here, results indicated that when the fungal treatment was applied to larvae before UV-C radiation, the virulence of C. fumosorosea was significantly reduced. However, this decline in virulence of C. fumosorosea due to UV-C exposure remained only for one generation, and no effect was observed on secondary infection. On the other hand, when larvae were exposed to UV-C radiation before fungal application, the mortality rate significantly increased as the exposure time to UV-C radiation increased. From the current study, it could be concluded that UV-C exposure suppressed the immunity to P. xylostella, which later enhanced the virulence of entomopathogenic fungi. Moreover, the study also suggested that UV irradiation is an effective pest management tool that could be incorporated into pest management strategies, which could help reduce pesticide application, be economically beneficial for the farmer, and be environmentally safe.",

Protein-protein interactions (PPI) were examined using the String database, and Cytoscape was used to combine and illustrate the findings. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were carried out using RStudio, and AutoDock Vina and Pymol were used for molecular docking and visualization, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 404 potential target genes were discovered after evaluating 21 active compounds from Cordyceps sinensis. Potential therapeutic targets included 67 targets that matched and overlapped with OLP, including TNF, IL-6, CD4, EGFR, and IL1B. Key targets were predominantly engaged in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and the MAPK signaling pathway, according to the GO and KEGG analyses. These targets have a connection to biological processes including apoptosis signaling pathway regulation, T cell activation, and oxidative stress response. The molecular docking results showed that TNF, IL-6, CD4, EGFR, and IL1B could bind to their corresponding active components. CONCLUSIONS: Cordyceps sinensis contains multiple components and acts on multiple targets and multiple pathways. Particularly, Cordyceps sinensis targets TNF, IL-6, CD4, EGFR, and IL1B, regulates PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling pathways, as well as takes part in biological processes including apoptosis, T cell activation, and oxidative stress. Cordyceps sinensis could be a crucial choice in the therapy of OLP."

      "abstract": "Background: Cordyceps is a precious Chinese herbal medicine with rich bio-active ingredients and is used for regulating arrhythmia alongside routine treatments. However, the efficacy and potential mechanisms of Cordyceps on patients with arrhythmia remain unclear. Methods: Randomized controlled trials of bradycardia treatment with Cordyceps were retrieved from diverse databases and available data. Dichotomous variables were expressed as a risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Continuous variables were expressed as a standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% CI. Network pharmacology was used to identify potential targets of Cordyceps for arrhythmia. Metascape was used for gene ontology (GO) and genome (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. Results: Nineteen trials included 1,805 patients with arrhythmia, of whom 918 were treated with Ningxinbao capsule plus routine drugs, and, as a control, 887 were treated with only routine drugs. Six trials reported on bradycardia and the other 13 on tachycardia. Treatment with Cordyceps significantly improved the total efficacy rate in both bradycardia (RR = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.35; Pz <0.00001) and tachycardia (RR = 1.27; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.39; Pz <0.00001). Cordyceps also had beneficial secondary outcomes. No serious adverse events occurred in patients treated with Cordyceps. The results of KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were mainly connected to adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. IL6, TNF, TP53, CASP3, CTNNB1, EGF, and NOS3 might be key targets for Cordyceps in the treatment of arrhythmia. Conclusion: This study confirmed that Cordyceps has a certain positive effect on the treatment of arrhythmia and that its main mechanism may be through the regulation of adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway."

      "abstract": "At present, there is no effective drug for the treatment of renal fibrosis; in particular, a safe and effective treatment for renal fibrosis should be established. Cordyceps has several medical effects, including immunoregulatory, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects, and may prevent kidney, liver, and heart diseases. Cordyceps has also been reported to be effective in the treatment of renal fibrosis. In this paper, we review the potential mechanisms of Cordyceps against renal fibrosis, focusing on the effects of Cordyceps on inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, regulation of autophagy, reduction of extracellular matrix deposition, and fibroblast activation. We also discuss relevant published clinical trials and meta-analyses. Available clinical studies support the possibility that Cordyceps and related products provide benefits to patients with chronic kidney diseases as adjuvants to conventional drugs. However, the existing clinical studies are limited by low quality and significant heterogeneity. The use of Cordyceps and related products may be a potential strategy for the treatment of renal fibrosis. Randomized controlled trial studies with good methodological quality, favorable experimental design, and large sample size are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cordyceps."

At present, the treatment of DKD is mainly focused on controlling the hyperglycemia, proteinuria, and hypertension, but is insufficient on the effective delay of DKD progression. Cordyceps sinensis is a kind of wild-used precious Chinese herb. Its extracts have effects of nephroprotection, hepatoprotection, neuroprotection, and protection against ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury, as well as anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities. According to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, Cordyceps sinensis can tonify the lung and the kidney. Several Chinese patent medicines produced from Cordyceps sinensis are often used to treat DKD and achieved considerable efficacy. This review summarized the clinical usage of Cordyceps sinensis, as well as its mainly biological activities including anti-hyperglycemic, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-oxidant, anti-fibrotic activities and regulation of apoptosis."

Beauvericin (BEA), one of the bioactive compounds of C. chanhua, has attracted much attention because of its medicinal value and food safety risk. In order to clear up the relationship between oxidative stress and BEA synthesis, we investigated the impact of H2O2-induced oxidative stress on the secondary metabolism of C. chanhua using untargeted metabolomics and a transcript profiling approach. Metabolic profiling of C. chanhua mycelia found that in total, 73 differential metabolites were identified, including organic acids, phospholipids, and non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs), especially the content of BEA, increasing 13-fold under oxidative stress treatment. Combining transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, we found that the genes and metabolites associated with the NRP metabolism, especially the BEA biosynthesis, were highly significantly enriched under H2O2-induced stress, which indicated that the BEA metabolism might be positive in the resistance of C. chanhua to oxidative stress. These results not only aid in better understanding of the resistance mechanisms of C. chanhua against oxidative stress but also might be helpful for molecular breeding of C. chanhua with low BEA content."

      "abstract": "Ectopic ceramide accumulation in insulin-responsive tissues contributes to the development of obesity and impairs insulin sensitivity. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of serine palmitoyl transferase (SPT), the first enzyme essential for ceramide biosynthesis using myriocin in rodents reduces body weight and improves insulin sensitivity and associated metabolic indices. Myriocin was originally extracted from fruiting bodies of the fungus Isaria sinclairii and has been found abundant in a number of closely related fungal species such as the Cordyceps. Myriocin is not approved for human use but extracts from Cordyceps are routinely consumed as part of traditional Chinese medication for the treatment of numerous diseases including diabetes. Herein, we screened commercially available extracts of Cordyceps currently being consumed by humans, to identify Cordyceps containing myriocin and test the efficacy of Cordyceps extract containing myriocin in obese mice to improve energy and glucose homeostasis. We demonstrate that commercially available Cordyceps contain variable amounts of myriocin and treatment of mice with a human equivalent dose of Cordyceps extract containing myriocin, reduces ceramide accrual, increases energy expenditure, prevents diet-induced obesity, improves glucose homeostasis and resolves hepatic steatosis. Mechanistically, these beneficial effects were due to increased adipose tissue browning/beiging, improved brown adipose tissue function and hepatic insulin sensitivity as well as alterations in the abundance of gut microbes such as Clostridium and Bilophila. Collectively, our data provide proof-of-principle that myriocin containing Cordyceps extract inhibit ceramide biosynthesis and attenuate metabolic impairments associated with obesity. Moreover, these studies identify commercially available Cordyceps as a readily available supplement to treat obesity and associated metabolic diseases.",

In this study, the antileukaemic cell proliferation activities of golden cordyceps extracts were examined and compared with standard cordycepin (CDCP) in EoL-1, U937, and KG-1a cells. Wilms' tumour 1 (WT1) protein was used as a biomarker of leukaemic cell proliferation. The cytotoxicity of the extracts on leukaemic cells was determined using the MTT assay. Their inhibitory effects on WT1 protein expression and cell cycle progression of EoL-1 cells were investigated using Western blotting and flow cytometry, respectively. Induction of KG-1a cell differentiation (using CD11b as a marker) was determined using flow cytometry. The golden cordyceps extracts exhibited cytotoxic effects on leukaemic cells with the highest IC50 value of 16.5 ± 3.9 µg/mL, while there was no effect on normal blood cells. The expression levels of WT1 protein in EoL-1 cells were decreased after treatment with the extracts. Moreover, cell cycle progression and cell proliferation were inhibited. The levels of CD11b increased slightly following the treatment. All these findings confirm the antileukaemic proliferation activity of golden cordyceps."

The aqueous and ethanolic extracts of C. militaris exhibited antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Cutibacterium acnes and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) with the MIC/MBC ranging from 3.91 to 31.25 mg/mL. The ethanolic extracts of the fruiting body and substrate from sample B also inhibited all bacterial growth within 2-4 h of treatment. Furthermore, ethanolic extract from sample B showed the highest cordycepin content of 57.42 mg/g extract, whereas the highest adenosine content, 3.78 mg/g extract, was observed in the ethanolic extract from the fruiting body of sample A by HPLC. The ethanolic extracts from sample A also demonstrated the highest antioxidant activity and flavonoid content by 9.50 mg GAE/g extract and 10.59 mg QAE/g extract, respectively. However, the highest phenolic content of 49.04 mg GAE/g extract was found in the aqueous extract of sample A. In addition, the ethanolic extract of sample A at 2 and 4 mg/mL could significantly down-regulate the mecA gene expression in MRSA. Our findings reported the potential of C. militaris extract as a new substance for the treatment of skin pathogenic bacteria infections and an antioxidant agent."

However, little is known about the role of C. cicadae mycelium in neuroprotection. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of C. cicadae mycelium extract (CCME) in the optic nerve crush (ONC) model. The optic nerves of adult male Wistar rats (aged 7-8 weeks) were crushed by a standardized method. Rats were divided equally into three groups: 1) a sham-operated group (sham), 2) a phosphate buffered saline-treated control group (crush), and 3) a CCME-treated group (CCME) that received CCME once daily for 7 consecutive days at doses of 100 mg/kg before ONC. Two weeks after ONC in rats, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) density and visual function were determined by using retrograde labeling with FluoroGold and flash visual evoked potentials. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and immunohistochemistry of ED1 (a marker of macrophage/microglia) were used to evaluate the antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects of CCME in the optic nerve section. The P1-N2 amplitude and RGC density in the CCME-treated group were higher than those in the ONC control (crush) group by 5.15- and 3.13-fold, respectively. The numbers of TUNEL-positive cells and ED1-positive cells in the CCME-treated group were reduced by 4.38- and 6.63-fold, respectively, compared to those in the crush group. Oral administration of CCME provided neuroprotective effects in the ONC model via antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory actions, which provides a potential treatment for patient with traumatic optic neuropathy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Depression is the most common type of psychological disorder, with continuous, prolonged, and persistent bad moods as the main clinical feature. Cordyceps sinensis is a complex consisting of the ascospores and bodies of insect larvae from the Hepialidae family that have been parasitized by Cordyceps sinensis militaris. Previous studies have reported that this herb has antidepressant activity. The present study used network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques to investigate the potential antidepressant mechanisms of Cordyceps sinensis. METHODS: The active ingredients of Cordyceps sinensis were identified using the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP) and the potential targets were predicted using the PharmMapper platform. The GeneCards database was then used to obtain sub-targets for depression. Common targets were screened and enrichment analyses were performed using the Metascape platform. Finally, the relationship between the active ingredients and the core targets were verified by molecular docking. RESULTS: Through network pharmacological analysis, 7 active ingredients in Cordyceps sinensis and 41 common targets of drugs and diseases were identified. The active ingredients of Cordyceps sinensis may exert antidepressant effects by acting on important targets such as catalase (CAT), CREB binding protein (CREBBP), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and E1A binding protein P300 (EP300), and by modulating the signaling pathways in which these targets are involved. Subsequently, the core targets were docked to the active ingredients and good binding was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The active ingredients of Cordyceps sinensis may exert antidepressant effects by regulating the CREB binding protein and anti-oxidative stress effects. The foxo signaling pathway (hsa04068), hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway (hsa04066), and Huntington's disease (hsa05016) may be involved in the underlying mechanisms of Cordyceps sinensis. The joint application of network pharmacology and molecular docking provides a new approach to study the mechanisms of action of traditional Chinese medicine. Cordyceps sinensis may play an important role in the future treatment of patients with depression."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a critical public health issue with a huge financial burden for both patients and society worldwide. Unfortunately, there are currently no efficacious therapies to prevent or delay the progression of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Traditional Chinese medicine practices have shown that Cordyceps militaris (C. militaris) mycelia have a variety of pharmacologically useful properties, including antitumor, immunomodulation, and hepatoprotection. However, the effect of mycelial C. militaris on CKD remains unclear. METHODS: Here, we investigated the effects of C. militaris mycelia on mice with CKD using four types of media: HKS, HKS with vitamin A (HKS + A), CM, and CM with vitamin A (CM + A). RESULTS: The results at day 10 revealed that the levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were significantly lower in the HKS (41%), HKS + A (41%), and CM + A (34%) groups compared with those in the corresponding control groups (nephrectomic mice). The level of serum creatinine in the HKS + A group decreased by 35% at day 10, whereas the levels in the HKS and CM + A groups decreased only by 14% and 13%, respectively, on day 30. Taken together, this is the first report using four new media (HKS, HKS + A, CM, and CM + A medium) for C. militaris mycelia. Each medium of mycelial C. militaris on CKD exhibits specific effect on BUN, serum creatinine, body weight, total protein, and uric acid. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, this is the first report using four new media (HKS, HKS + A, CM, and CM + A medium) for C. militaris mycelia. Each medium of mycelial C. militaris on CKD exhibits specific effects on BUN, serum creatinine, body weight, total protein, and uric acid. We concluded that treatment with C. militaris mycelia cultured in HKS or CM + A medium could potentially prevent the deterioration of kidney function in mice with CKD."

In this study, the beneficial effects of cordycepin (COR), isolated from potential medicinal fungi Cordyceps militaris, in aging-associated testicular inflammation and serum biochemical changes in naturally aged rats were investigated. Male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into young control (YC), aged control (AC), and COR (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) treated aged rat groups. Aging-associated serum biochemical changes and inflammatory parameters were analyzed by biochemical assay kits, Western blotting, and real-time RT-PCR. Results showed a significant (p < 0.05) alteration in the total blood cell count, lipid metabolism, and liver functional parameters in AC group when compared with YC group. However, COR-treated aged rats ameliorated the altered biochemical parameters significantly (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 at 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg, respectively). Furthermore, the increase in the expression of inflammatory mediators (COX-2, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tissue necrosis factor-alpha) in aged rat testis was significant (p < 0.05) when compared with YC group. Treatment with COR at 20 mg/kg to aged rats attenuated the increased expression of inflammatory mediators significantly (p < 0.05). Mechanistic studies revealed that the potential attenuating effects exhibited by COR in aged rats was mediated by regulation of NF-κB activation and MAPKs (c-Jun N-terminal kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and p38) signaling. In conclusion, COR restored the altered serum biochemical parameters in aged rats and ameliorated the aging-associated testicular inflammation proving the therapeutic benefits of COR targeting inflammaging-associated male sexual dysfunctions."

      "abstract": "Cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) is a nucleoside analogue and biosynthesised by Cordyceps militaris, an entomopathogenic fungus. In this study, an epigenetic modifier was applied to static liquid cultures to enhance cordycepin production. C. militaris was cultured in a static liquid culture, and valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, was supplemented in order to modifying the epigenetic status. Gene regulatory network was explored to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying cordycepin production. 50 micromolar of VPA enhanced cordycepin production by 41.187% via the upregulation of 5'-nucleotidase, adenylate kinase, phosphorybosyltransferase, Cns1, Cns2, Cnsa3, and Cns4 of C. militaris for at least 2 days after VPA treatment. The maximum production of cordycepin was 2,835.32 ± 34.35 mg/L in 400 mL-working volume. A scaled-up culture was established with a working volume of 10 L, which led to the slight decrease of cordycepin production. This might due to multifactorial effects, for instance limited aeration and an uneven dispersion of nutrients in the culture system. This scaled-up culture was still needed further optimization. The modification of epigenetic status by VPA significantly enhanced cordycepin production by altering key gene regulatory network of C. militaris. The strategy established in this study might be applicable to other microorganism culture in order to improving the production of bioactive compounds. This work aimed to enhance the production of cordycepin by modifying the epigenetic status of C. militaris, in which subsequently altered gene regulatory network of cordycepin biosynthesis pathway. The weekly supplementation of valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, significantly improve cordycepin production over 40%, compared to the untreated control, and the gene regulatory network of C. militaris was also adapted.",

      "abstract": "Increasing attention focuses on the relationship between neuroinflammation and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The reports on the microbiota-gut-brain axis reveal that the regulation by gut microbiota is an effective way to intervene in neuroinflammation-related AD. In this study, two novel selenium peptides (Se-Ps), VPRKL(Se)M (Se-P1) and RYNA(Se)MNDYT (Se-P2), with neuroprotection effects were obtained from Se-enriched Cordyceps militaris. Se-P1 and Se-P2 pre-protection led to a 30 and 33% increase in the PC-12 cell viability compared to the damage group, respectively. Moreover, Se-Ps exhibited a significant pre-protection against LPS-induced inflammatory and oxidative stress in the colon and brain by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory mediators (p < 0.05) and malondialdehyde, as well as promoting anti-inflammatory cytokine level and antioxidant enzyme activity (p < 0.05), which may alleviate the cognitive impairment in LPS-injured mice (p < 0.05). Se-Ps not only repaired the intestinal mucosa damage of LPS-injured mice but also had a positive effect on gut microbiota dysbacteriosis by increasing the abundance of Lactobacillus and Alistipes and decreasing the abundance of Akkermansia and Bacteroides. Collectively, the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and regulating properties on gut microflora of Se-Ps contribute to their neuroprotection, supporting that Se-Ps could be a promising dietary supplement in the prevention and/or treatment of AD.",

      "abstract": "Hypertensive renal injury is a complication of hypertension. Cordyceps cicadae (C. cicadae) is a traditional Chinese medicine used to treat chronic kidney diseases especially renal fibrosis. Autophagy is described as a cell self-renewal process that requires lysosomal degradation and is utilized for the maintenance of cellular energy homeostasis. The present study explores the mechanism underlying C. cicadae's renoprotection on hypertensive nephropathy (HN). First, HN rat models were established on spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). The expression of fibrosis-related protein and autophagy-associated protein was detected in vivo. NRK-52E cells exposed to AngII were chosen to observe the potential health benefits of C. cicadae on renal damage. The level of extracellular matrix accumulation was detected using capillary electrophoresis immunoquantification and immunohistochemistry. After treatment with lysosomal inhibitors (chloroquine) or an autophagy activator (rapamycin), the expression of Beclin-1, LC3II, and SQSTM1/p62 was further investigated. The study also investigated the change in sirtuin1 (SIRT1), fork head box O3a (FOXO3a), and peroxidation (superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA)) expression when intervened by resveratrol. The changes in SIRT1 and FOXO3a were measured in patients and the SHRs. Here, we observed that C. cicadae significantly decreased damage to renal tubular epithelial cells and TGFβ1, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), collagen I (Col-1), and fibronectin expression. Meanwhile, autophagy defects were observed both in vivo and in vitro. C. cicadae intervention significantly downregulated Beclin-1 and LC3II and decreased SQSTM1/p62, showing an inhibition of autophagic vesicles and the alleviation of autophagy stress. These functions were suppressed by rapamycin, and the results were just as effective as the resveratrol treatment. HN patients and the SHRs exhibited decreased levels of SIRT1 and FOXO3a. We also observed a positive correlation between SIRT1/FOXO3a and antifibrotic effects. Similar to the resveratrol group, the expression of SIRT1/FOXO3a and oxidative stress were elevated by C. cicadae in vivo. Taken together, our findings show that C. cicadae ameliorates tubulointerstitial fibrosis and delays HN progression. Renoprotection was likely attributable to the regulation of autophagic stress mediated by the SIRT1 pathway and achieved by regulating FOXO3a and oxidative stress."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the functional and quality improvement of retorted Korean ginseng chicken soup that was hydrolyzed using a single extract from Cordyceps militaris (CM) mushroom, or in combination with bromelain, flavorzyme, or a mix of both. A total of 36 fat-trimmed breast meat from commercial broilers were hydrolyzed with one of six treatments, (1) flavorzyme as a positive control (PC), (2) no addition as negative control (NC), (3) crude CM extract (CME), CM extract prepared with either (4) bromelain (CMB), (5) flavorzyme (CMF), or (6) bromelain:flavorzyme mixture (CMBF) in a water bath at 55 °C for 2.5 h, and subsequently retorted at 121.1 °C, 147.1 kPa for 1 h. The highest antioxidant activity was observed in the CMB treatment (40.32%), followed by CMBF (34.20%), and CME (32.97%). The suppression of malondialdehyde ranged between 28 and 83%. The water-holding-capacity of the treated samples increased, ranging between 59.69 and 62.98%, and significantly tenderized the meat. The shear force decreased from 23.05 N in negative control to 11.67 N in the CMB samples. The predominant nucleotides across the samples were 5'-IMP and hypoxanthine, and the lowest was adenosine. The intensification of the taste properties was due to the increase of umami substances, both by 5'-nucleotides (5'-IMP, 5'-GMP) and free amino acids (FAAs), whereas the highest improvement was observed in the CMB group. Therefore, the hydrolyzation of Korean ginseng chicken soup using CM extract, prepared using bromelain, improves functional and quality profiles."

      "abstract": "Cordyceps militaris (CM) is traditionally used as dietary therapy for lung cancer patients in China. CM extract (CME) is hydrosoluble fraction of CM and extensively investigated. Caspase-3-involved cell death is considered as its major anticancer mechanism but inconclusive. Therefore, we explore its caspase-3-dependent programmed cell death nature (apoptosis and pyroptosis) and validate its caspase-3-dependent property in loss-of-function experiment. Component profile of CME is detected by High Performance Liquid Chromatography- quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-qTOF). Results show that CME causes pyroptosis-featured cell bubbling and cell lysis and inhibits cell proliferation in A549 cell. CME induces chromatin condensing and makes PI+/annexin V+ staining in bubbling cells, indicating genotoxicity, apoptosis, and pyroptosis cell death are caused by CME. High concentration of CME (200 μg/ml) exerts G2/M and G0 cell cycles arresting and suppresses P53-downstream proliferative proteins, including P53, P21, CDC25B, CyclinB1, Bcl-2, and BCL2 associated agonist of cell death (BAD), but 1-100 μg/ml of CME show less effect on proteins above. Correspondingly, caspase-3 activity and caspase-3 downstream proteins including pyroptotic effector gasdermin-E (GSDME) and apoptotic marker cleaved-poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) are significantly promoted by CME. Moreover, regarding membrane pore formation in pyroptotic cell, expression of membrane GSDME (GSDME antibody conjugated with PE-Cy7 for detection in flow cytometry) is remarkably increased by CME treatment. By contrast, other pyroptosis-related proteins such as P2X7, NLRP3, GSDMD, and Caspase-1 are not affected after CME treatment. Additionally, TET2 is unexpectedly raised by CME. In present of caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO (Ac-DC), CME-induced cytotoxicity, cell bubbling, and genotoxicity are reduced, and CME-induced upregulation of apoptosis (cleaved-PARP-1) and pyroptosis (GSDME-NT) proteins are reversed. Lastly, 22 components are identified in HPLC-qTOF experiment, and they are classified into trophism, neoadjuvant component, cytotoxic component, and cancer deterioration promoter according to previous references. Conclusively, CME causes caspase-3-dependent apoptosis and pyroptosis in A549 through caspase-3/PARP and caspase-3/GSDME pathways, and it provides basic insight into clinic application of CME for cancer patients."

      "abstract": "Cordycepin is a major bioactive compound found in Cordyceps militaris (C. militaris) that exhibits a broad spectrum of biological activities. Hence, it is potentially a bioactive ingredient of pharmaceutical and cosmetic products. However, overexploitation and low productivity of natural C. militaris is a barrier to commercialization, which leads to insufficient supply to meet its existing market demands. In this study, a preliminary study of distinct concentrations of salt treatments toward C. militaris was conducted. Although the growth of C. militaris was inhibited by different salt treatments, the cordycepin production increased significantly accompanied by the increment of salt concentration. Among them, the content of cordycepin in the 7% salt-treated group was five-fold higher than that of the control group. Further transcriptome analysis of samples with four salt concentrations, coupled with Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment, several differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found. Finally, dynamic changes of the expression patterns of four genes involved in the cordycepin biosynthesis pathway were observed by the quantitative real-time PCR. Taken together, our study provides a global transcriptome characterization of the salt treatment adaptation process in C. militaris and facilitates the construction of industrial strains with a high cordycepin production and salt tolerance."
