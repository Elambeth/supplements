      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Mediterranean diet (MD) has been proposed as a dietary therapy for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) but its efficacy remains unclear. We compared the efficacy of MD to a diet low in fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols (LFD). METHODS: In this pilot-feasibility, randomized controlled trial (RCT), adult patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) or mixed bowel pattern (IBS-M) were randomized to MD versus LFD for 4 weeks. Meals were provided for both groups (ModifyHealth, GA). Daily variables included abdominal pain intensity (API) and bloating, while IBS symptom severity score (IBS-SSS) and IBS adequate relief (IBS-AR) were scored weekly. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with ≥ 30% decrease in API for ≥ 2/4 weeks. RESULTS: Of 26 randomized patients, 20 finished the study (10 per group). Seventy-three percent of the MD group met the primary endpoint compared to 81.8% of the LFD group (p = 1.0). Although not statistically significant, a numerically higher proportion of the LFD group reported adequate relief and met the responder endpoint for IBS-SSS (50-point reduction) compared to the MD group (54.6% vs. 27.3% for IBS-AR and 81.8% vs. 45.5% for IBS-SSS, p = 0.39 and 0.18, respectively). The LFD group also had a significantly greater reduction in IBS-SSS score over the 4-week treatment period compared to the MD group (-105.5 vs. -60, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: MD provides symptom relief in IBS-D and IBS-M; however, the magnitude of relief was higher with the LFD. Larger diet comparison studies in real-world settings are needed before MD can be routinely recommended to IBS patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT05807919."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with endometriosis often experience bowel symptoms such as changing stool, abdominal pain and bloating similar to those associated with irritable bowel syndrome. These symptoms reduce quality of life (QoL). Visceral hypersensitivity seems to be a shared pathogenic factor. The low-FODMAP (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides and Polyols) diet is a known visceral hypersensitivity targeted therapy with significant reduction in bowel symptoms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of low-FODMAP diet on bowel symptoms such as constipation and bloating, pain and QoL in patients with endometriosis. METHODS: The diet involved four weeks of FODMAP elimination, followed by a reintroduction-period of at least ten weeks, varying by patient. Questionnaires were sent at baseline and after these periods. The primary outcome was constipation change after the reintroduction period compared to baseline, assessed by Groningen-DeFeC-questionnaire (0-30 scale) with paired-T-test or Wilcoxon-signed-rank-test. Secondary outcomes included changes in bloating, QoL and abdominal pain, assessed by Endometriosis Health Profile-30 (EHP-30). P-value < 0,05 indicated statistical significance. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were included; thirteen withdrew before starting the diet, mostly due to lack of motivation. Of the remaining 34, 24 (71%) completed the diet (i.e. following the prescribed periods) Constipation scores improved significantly after low-FODMAP diet compared to baseline from 7.0 to 5.0 (p = 0.023). There was no significant difference observed in bloating, however 53% of patients that completed the diet mentioned a decrease. The following domains of the EHP-30 improved significantly: pain (from 47.8 to 29.2 (p = 0.002)), control and powerlessness (from 69.4 to 36.7 (p = 0.000)), emotional well-being (from 45.2 to 29.2 (p = 0.001)), social support (from 46.4 to 31.3 (p = 0.0017)), self-image (from 51.2 to 40.5 (p = 0.035)), work-life (from 35.0 to 21.7 (p = 0.003)) and sexual intercourse (from 61.6 to 45.7 (p = 0.023)). 65% of patients that completed the diet mentioned a decrease in pain, especially chronic pelvic pain. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests the low-FODMAP diet may improve bowel symptoms and QoL in endometriosis patients motivated to follow the diet, highlighting its potential in endometriosis care. However, further research in larger populations is needed to explore factors like endometriosis type, pain intensity and dropout rates to confirm these findings.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many patients with ulcerative colitis report ongoing diarrhoea even when their disease is stable and in remission. DESIGN: MODULATE was a pragmatic, multicentre, seamless, adaptive, phase 2/3 open-label, parallel-group, multiarm multistage randomised controlled trial. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: People aged over 18 years with stable ulcerative colitis who had diarrhoea, recruited from secondary care sites in the United Kingdom. INTERVENTIONS: The control arm consisted of modified first-line dietary advice given to all patients with irritable bowel syndrome; the first interventional arm was amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, which at low doses slows colonic transit; the second intervention was loperamide, an antidiarrhoeal drug also thought to slow colonic transit; the third was ondansetron, an antiemetic thought to slow colonic transit; and the fourth was a diet low in fermentable oligo-, di-, and mono-saccharides and polyols, which is thought to reduce bloating and gas within the small intestine. All patients randomised to an interventional arm were to receive treatment for 6 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Phase 2: Improvement in diarrhoea measured using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale-irritable bowel syndrome questionnaire at 8 weeks post randomisation: improvement defined as those reporting minor discomfort from diarrhoea or less (scoring ≤ 2 on the diarrhoea subscale). SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Phases 2 and 3: Measured at both 8 weeks and 6 months: Improvement in diarrhoea measured using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale-irritable bowel syndrome. Blood for C-reactive protein, stool for faecal calprotectin at 6 months only, reviewing case notes for escalation of medical therapy for ulcerative colitis. Anxiety and depression, via the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: The MODULATE trial opened in December 2021 and closed in January 2023. Of the eight secondary care sites that completed contracting, only four opened to recruitment during this time, and one person was randomised. Trial timelines coincided with the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, causing substantial delays and, ultimately, its early closure. During this time, the trial underwent two major redesign phases, enabling a fully remote participant pathway incorporating electronic consent, remote data capture, posted blood and stool sample kits for eligibility screening, delivery of the dietary intervention via telephone or video call platform, postage of trial investigational medicinal products directly to participants' homes and all trial follow-up appointments conducted via telephone. The second phase of redesign pushed the trial towards a fully decentralised model. However, this stage was not implemented due to the decision to close the trial early. LIMITATIONS: The study was unable to recruit the necessary sample size, preventing the trial from progressing. The trial met with several challenges. The Trial Steering Committee's root cause analysis concluded that the pandemic was the leading factor in trial closure, especially regarding our ability to recruit both sites and participants. CONCLUSIONS: Although the trial closed early and with insufficient participants to proceed with full statistical analysis, lessons were learnt that could potentially inform future remote trial design and decentralised participant pathways. FUTURE WORK: MODULATE was a commissioned call in response to a priority question identified by people living with ulcerative colitis. The question remains important and unanswered; trials to address it are needed. Given the recruitment difficulties we experienced, consideration should be given to conducting these in both primary and secondary care. FUNDING: This synopsis presents independent research funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme as award number 17/33/03."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to assess the use of a low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) diet in children with different types of functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPD) and to identify predictive factors of response to this diet. METHODS: This was a multicenter, experimental, uncontrolled, prospective trial. Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia, and functional abdominal pain followed a low FODMAP diet for 2 weeks. We collected data on abdominal pain before and after the diet. Patients who showed a ≥ 50 % reduction in abdominal pain frequency were considered responders. RESULTS: A total of 48 patients with FAPD participated in this trial. They all showed a significant decrease in the frequency (p < 0.05) and intensity (p < 0.05) of abdominal pain after the diet. We considered 41.7 % of patients to be responders. Among children with functional dyspepsia, 66.6 % responded to the diet, and so did 71.4 % of those with IBS. On the contrary, 71.8 % of children with functional abdominal pain were non-responders, and this diagnosis was considered a predictive factor of poor response to the diet (OR: 9.87, CI [1.52; 63.97], p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: In children with FAPD, a diagnosis of functional abdominal pain is a predictive factor of poor response to a low FODMAP diet. Better results were achieved with this diet in children with IBS or functional dyspepsia.",

      "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits. Low-FODMAP diets, which involve restricting fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols, have emerged as an effective dietary intervention for alleviating IBS symptoms. This review paper aims to synthesize current insights into the impact of a low-FODMAP diet on the gut microbiome and its mechanisms of action in managing IBS. We explore the alterations in microbial composition and function associated with a low-FODMAP diet and discuss the implications of these changes for gut health and symptom relief. Additionally, we examine the balance between symptom improvement and potential negative effects on microbial diversity and long-term gut health. Emerging evidence suggests that while a low-FODMAP diet can significantly reduce IBS symptoms, it may also lead to reductions in beneficial microbial populations. Strategies to mitigate these effects, such as the reintroduction phase and the use of probiotics, are evaluated. This review highlights the importance of a personalized approach to dietary management in IBS, considering individual variations in microbiome responses. Understanding the intricate relationship between diet, the gut microbiome, and IBS symptomatology will guide the development of more effective, sustainable dietary strategies for IBS patients.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) in adolescents with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional abdominal pain-not otherwise specified (FAP-NOS) in a non-guided setting, resembling clinical practice. This prospective multicenter cohort study conducted in 13 centers included patients aged 12-18 years diagnosed with IBS or FAP-NOS. Patients received educational material on FODMAPs, including extensive lists of high and low FODMAP foods and additional online information. They were instructed to replace high FODMAP foods with low FODMAP alternatives for the duration of 4 weeks. No dietician was consulted. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with treatment success (≥ 30% reduction of abdominal pain intensity) at 4 weeks. The key secondary outcome was adequate relief of IBS/FAP-NOS symptoms. Of the 325 included patients, 81 patients (24.9%) achieved treatment success (≥ 30% reduction of abdominal pain intensity) after 4 weeks, with higher rates in patients with IBS (29.3%) than FAP-NOS (16.8%, OR 2.16 (1.04-4.48)). Adequate relief was reported in 51 patients (15.7%). There was a significant decrease in abdominal pain intensity (2.2 (1.1) vs. 2.5 (1.0), P < 0.001), daily bloating (2.4 (2.1) vs. 2.8 (2.3), P < 0.001), and flatulence (2.4 (2.1) vs. 2.8 (2.3), P = 0.001). Adverse events were mild and infrequent. CONCLUSION: The low FODMAP diet in a non-guided setting, mimicking clinical practice, yielded treatment success in almost 30% adolescents with IBS and 17% in FAP-NOS, suggesting it may not be the first treatment option for these patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EUCTR2015-003293-32-NL. WHAT IS KNOWN: • Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional abdominal pain-not otherwise specified (FAP-NOS) are common disorders in children which negatively impact quality of life. • While a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) has demonstrated effectiveness in adult IBS, its efficacy in pediatric IBS and FAP-NOS remains uncertain. • Clinical application of the low FODMAP diet often occurs without dietician consultation, contrary to controlled trial settings. WHAT IS NEW: • The low FODMAP diet, without dietician guidance, resulted in treatment success in almost 30% of adolescents with IBS and only 17% with FAP-NOS. • With only 15.7% of participants achieving adequate relief of IBS/FAP-NOS symptoms, the non-guided low FODMAP diet may not be the first treatment option for pediatric IBS and FAP-NOS.",

However, the application of this diet among Malaysian IBS patients is not well understood. This study aimed to explore the practices and barriers in delivering the LFD among Malaysia dietitians. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted online with practicing dietitians until the data reached saturation. All the interview sessions were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. Eleven dietitians were interviewed, with 36.4% (n = 4) having more than 10 years of experience. The following four themes regarding their practices emerged: 1. dietary advice on FODMAP restriction; 2. duration of FODMAP restriction phase; 3. references used to get information about FODMAPs, and 4. strategies on reintroduction. Meanwhile, the following seven barriers were identified: 1. lack of culturally relevant educational materials; 2. limited knowledge about the LFD; 3. inadequate formal training among dietitians; 4. lack of integration in multi-disciplinary care; 5. low health literacy of patients; 6. low compliance rate among patients, and 7. restrictions for certain populations. LFD implementation in Malaysia is not standardized as only experienced dietitians can provide dietary evidence-based advice. Lack of training and culturally specific resources are some of the main barriers that were identified to be limiting the implementation of the diet. Therefore, there is a need for training programs and resource development to support Malaysian dietitians in managing IBS patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Common gastrointestinal disease irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is marked by symptoms like changed bowel habits, bloating, and stomach ache. A low-FODMAP combined gluten-free diet (LF-GFD) has been suggested as a possible therapy for IBS symptoms management. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to investigate whether a LF-GFD would help patients with IBS. METHODS: Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria from internet databases helped to identify clinical studies evaluating the intervention of LF-GFD in the treatment of IBS patients. Using measurements including the visual analog scale (VAS) for bloating and pain, the IBS symptom severity scale (IBS-SSS), and IBS quality of life (IBS-QoL), the main results evaluated were the efficacy of LF-GFD in reducing IBS symptoms. Furthermore assessed were the psychological impacts of LF-GFD utilizing the self- rating depression scale (SDS) and self- rating anxiety scale (SAS). RESULTS: A total of 437 patients (221 on LF-GFD diet and 216 on GFD) were involved in 4 randomized controlled trials and 4 cohort studies. The combined results indicated that LF-GFD reduced the VAS bloating ratings (RR = - 0.58, 95%CI - 0.92-0.23, P = 0.0010, I2 = 83%) and the VAS pain scores (RR = - 0.42, 95%CI - 0.66-0.19, P = 0.005, I2 = 58%). In addition, LF-GFD indicated a substantial enhancement in IBS-SSS scores (MD = - 1.42, 95%CI - 2.74-0.10, P = 0.03, I2 = 24%) and IBS-QoL ratings (MD = 3.75, 95%CI 0.98-6.53, P = 0.008, I2 = 33%). Moreover, the LF-GFD group showed a substantial drop in SDS (MD = - 2.56, 95%CI - 3.38-1.74, P < 0.00001, I2 = 65%) and SAS (MD = - 4.30, 95%CI - 6.53-2.24, P < 0.0001, I2 = 0%) scores compared to the GFD group. CONCLUSION: LF-GFD therapy significantly enhances clinical symptoms and reduces anxiety and depression in individuals diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Functional dyspepsia is a complex collection of symptoms from the gastroduodenal, while irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disease that chronically weakens gastrointestinal. The occurrences of both of these diseases are common; however, the new approach therapy introducing the low-FODMAP diet (low fructose, oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) is rarely discussed. The aim of this case report was to present a case of functional dyspepsia with IBS mixed type treated with a low-FODMAP diet. A female 37 years old reported complaints of heartburn worsening over the last seven months. Based on IBS-symptom severity scale (IBS-SSS) assessment, the patient had 75% scale on belly pain and 50% abdominal distention, which interfered the daily activity significantly. The patient was diagnosed with functional dyspepsia subtype postprandial distress syndrome with IBS mixed type. In addition, the low-FODMAP diet was started immediately, together with pharmacological therapy (oral omeprazole and domperidone), and followed up each week. On the first week of evaluation, the patient was feeling much better as IBS-SSS assessment scores decreased, and the pharmacological therapy was stopped. On the second week of evaluation, the patient had no more complaints with IB-SSS assessment markedly decreased. This case highlights that low-FODMAP diet could be a new approach therapy for IBS that could improve the IBS symptoms.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common and debilitating disorder manifesting with abdominal pain and bowel dysfunction. A mainstay of treatment is dietary modification, including restriction of FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols). A greater response to a low FODMAP diet has been reported in those with a distinct IBS microbiome termed IBS-P. We investigated whether this is linked to specific changes in the metabolome in IBS-P. METHODS: Solid phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to examine the faecal headspace of 56 IBS cases (each paired with a non-IBS household control) at baseline, and after four-weeks of a low FODMAP diet (39 pairs). 50% cases had the IBS-P microbial subtype, while the others had a microbiome that more resembled healthy controls (termed IBS-H). Clinical response to restriction of FODMAPs was measured with the IBS-symptom severity scale, from which a pain sub score was calculated. FINDINGS: Two distinct metabotypes were identified and mapped onto the microbial subtypes. IBS-P was characterised by a fermentative metabolic profile rich in short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). After FODMAP restriction significant reductions in SCFAs were observed in IBS-P. SCFA levels did not change significantly in the IBS-H group. The magnitude of pain and overall symptom improvement were significantly greater in IBS-P compared to IBS-H (p = 0.016 and p = 0.026, respectively). Using just five metabolites, a biomarker model could predict microbial subtype with accuracy (AUROC 0.797, sensitivity 78.6% (95% CI: 0.78-0.94), specificity 71.4% (95% CI: 0.55-0.88). INTERPRETATION: A metabotype high in SCFAs can be manipulated by restricting fermentable carbohydrate, and is associated with an enhanced clinical response to this dietary restriction. This implies that SCFAs harbour pro-nociceptive potential when produced in a specific IBS niche. By ascertaining metabotype, microbial subtype can be predicted with accuracy. This could allow targeted FODMAP restriction in those seemingly primed to respond best. FUNDING: This research was co-funded by Addenbrooke's Charitable Trust, Cambridge University Hospitals and the Wellcome Sanger Institute, and supported by the NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre (BRC-1215-20014).",

      "abstract": "In this article we present a protocol for the use of the low-FODMAP diet in paediatric patients and review of the current evidence on its efficacy. These short-chain carbohydrates, which can be fermented by the intestinal microbiota, are found in a wide variety of foods, mainly of plant origin. The low-FODMAP diet is a therapeutic tool used for the management of gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome. The sources we used were PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar and institutional websites. Following consumption of FODMAP-rich foods, a series of end products are generated that are not absorbed, giving rise to symptoms. Before starting a low-FODMAP diet, it is important to carry out a diagnostic evaluation including any applicable tests. Treatment is structured in 3 phases: elimination, reintroduction and personalization phase. In the first phase, FODMAP-rich foods are eliminated for 2-3 weeks. In the second phase, lasting 8 weeks, FODMAP-rich foods are gradually reintroduced. The last phase consists in customizing the diet according to individual tolerance. This article details which foods contain FODMAPs and possible substitutes. In addition, specific food diary/intake tracking and educational materials are provided in a series of appendices to facilitate adherence to the diet. Although most studies have been conducted in adults, there is also some evidence on the beneficial effects in the paediatric age group, with a reduction of symptoms, especially in patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders. Nevertheless, more research is required on the subject.",

The aim was to compare gastrointestinal symptoms and dietary intake of patients with irritable bowel syndrome following a low FODMAP diet, with or without individual nutrition therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 54 patients that met Rome IV criteria for IBS were randomized into two groups, guided group (individual nutrition therapy, n=28) and self-management group (learned about low FODMAP diet online, n=26). Both groups followed low FODMAP diet for 4 weeks. Four-day food records were used to assess dietary intake. Symptoms were assessed by the IBS-severity scoring system (ISB-SSS). RESULTS: The number of subjects who did not complete the study was 13, thereof five in the nutrition therapy and eight in the self-management group, leaving 23 and 18 subjects available for analysis, respectively. Symptoms declined from baseline to endpoint in both groups, by 183±101 points on average in the group receiving nutrition therapy (p< 0.001) and 132±110 points in the self-management group (p< 0.001), with no difference between groups. At baseline, about 80% of meals in both groups contained food high in FODMAP's. The corresponding proportion was 9% and 36% in week 3 in the nutrition therapy and self-management group, respectively (p< 0.001). CONCLUSION: Both groups experienced relieve of symptoms, but compliance to the low FODMAP diet was better in the group receiving individual nutrition therapy compared with the group who only received instructions on how to learn about low FODMAP diet online.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: According to national guidelines, a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) is a second-line therapy option for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and improves functional intestinal symptoms. Numerous noteworthy results have been published in this field over the past fifteen years. This study aims to analyze the global research trend and hotspot of the low FODMAP diet research, and provide a comprehensive perspective and direction for researchers. METHODS: The Science Citation Index-Expanded of the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) was used to identify low FODMAP diet-related articles and reviews. Three bibliometric programs (CiteSpace, VOSviewer, Scimago Graphic) were utilized to analyze and visualize the annual publications, authors, countries, institutions, journals, citations, and keywords. RESULTS: In total, 843 documents related to the low FODMAP diet research were published in 227 journals by 3,343 authors in 1,233 institutions from 59 countries. The United States, which was the most engaged nation in international collaboration, had the largest annual production and the fastest growth. The most productive organization was Monash University, and the most fruitful researcher was Gibson PR. Nutrients ranked first in terms of the number of published documents. The article \"A diet low in FODMAPs reduces symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome\" (Halmos EP, 2014) received the most co-citations. Keywords that appear frequently in the literature mainly involve two main aspects: the clinical efficacy evaluation and mechanism exploration of the low FODMAP diet. The term \"gut microbiota\" stands out as the most prominent keyword among the burst keywords that have remained prevalent till date. CONCLUSION: The restriction stage of the low FODMAP diet is superior to other dietary therapies for IBS in terms of symptom response, but it has a negative impact on the abundance of gut Bifidobacteria and diet quality. Identification of biomarkers to predict response to the low FODMAP diet is of great interest and has become the current research hotspot.",

In a double-blind, pilot-feasibility randomized controlled trial, we compared the efficacy of a 4-week FODMAP-simple restriction phase (eliminating solely fructans and galactooligosaccharides) and a traditional LFD restriction phase in patients with IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D) (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number NCT05831306).",

      "abstract": "A low FODMAP diet (LFD) is a common restrictive diet to manage the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, there is no consensus on the alleviating effects of this diet. Herein, a systematic umbrella review with meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of an LFD on IBS symptoms and its secondary outcomes in patients, which were not reported in previous meta-analyses. We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science up to December 2023. The methodological quality of systematic reviews and their included trials was evaluated using AMSTAR 2 and the Cochrane risk of bias, respectively. The certainty of the evidence tool was evaluated using the GRADE approach. The data related to IBS symptoms, quality of life (QoL), microbiome diversity, and stool short-chain fatty acids were extracted. A random-effect (if RCTs ≥ 6) or fixed-effect model (if RCTs < 5) was used to recalculate effect sizes and 95% CIs and report them in both qualitative and quantitative terms (pooled risk ratio, Hedges' g, and weighted mean difference). A total of 658 articles were initially identified, with 11 meta-analyses and 24 RCTs reporting 28 outcomes with 1646 participants included. An LFD significantly affected the clinical improvement of total symptoms according to the IBS-SSS questionnaire (RR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.97; P = 0.04) in all the subtypes of IBS and also had favorable effects on stool consistency (WMD: -0.48; 95% CI: -0.902, -0.07) and frequency (WMD: -0.36; 95% CI: -0.61, -0.10) and some other GI symptoms in both less and more than 4 weeks of diet intervention except for stool consistency, which needed more than 4 weeks of LFD implementation. A significant QoL improvement was observed but not in the anxiety and depression state. Furthermore, some studies showed that an LFD may increase fecal pH and dysbiosis and reduce SCFA and the abundance of Bifidobacterium. In conclusion, an LFD can alleviate symptoms and QoL in IBS patients, although dysbiosis may occur. Considering the low certainty of evidence, strong RCTs with more appropriate designs are needed.",

However, knowledge on the extended effects of the restriction phase regarding nutrient intake, symptom severity, and quality of life (QoL) is sparse. Therefore, our objectives were to evaluate the safety of a dietitian-led 12-week strict LFD on measures of blood biochemistry, nutritional status, symptom severity, and QoL. METHODS: In this open-label dietitian-led 12-week strict LFD intervention for IBS patients with predominantly diarrhea or mixed stool pattern (IBS-D/-M), we collected data on diet intake (3-day dietary record), overnight fasting routine blood samples, body weight, IBS symptoms (IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS)), and IBS-related QoL (IBS-QoL) at baseline and after 12 weeks. KEY RESULTS: Thirty-six participants completed the 12-week follow-up (mean age: 37 years, 67% women, IBS-SSS: 242 (101)). All blood parameters measured were within established reference values at both time points. We found no change in intake of macro- or micronutrients, but several micronutrients were below the recommendations both before and after 12 weeks. BMI slightly decreased, primarily driven by participants with BMI >25 (p < 0.005). QoL improved among most subdomains (p ≤ 0.002), except food avoidance and social reaction. CONCLUSION: An extended dietitian-guided LFD (12 weeks) is not inferior to the participants' baseline diet, since no clinically meaningful changes in nutritionally related blood samples and no changes in macro- or micronutrient intake were observed. However, the intake of several nutrients was below the recommendations at both time points indicating low diet quality.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dietary advice and medical treatments are recommended to patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Studies have not yet compared the efficacy of dietary treatment with pharmacological treatment targeting the predominant IBS symptom. We therefore aimed to compare the effects of two restrictive dietary treatment options versus optimised medical treatment in people with IBS. METHODS: This single-centre, single-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted in a specialised outpatient clinic at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. Participants (aged ≥18 years) with moderate-to-severe IBS (Rome IV; IBS Severity Scoring System [IBS-SSS] ≥175) and no other serious diseases or food allergies were randomly assigned (1:1:1) by web-based randomisation to receive a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) plus traditional IBS dietary advice recommended by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (hereafter the LFTD diet), a fibre-optimised diet low in total carbohydrates and high in protein and fat (hereafter the low-carbohydrate diet), or optimised medical treatment based on predominant IBS symptom. Participants were masked to the names of the diets, but the pharmacological treatment was open-label. The intervention lasted 4 weeks, after which time participants in the dietary interventions were unmasked to their diets and encouraged to continue during 6 months' follow-up, participants in the LFTD group were instructed on how to reintroduce FODMAPs, and participants receiving pharmacological treatment were offered diet counselling and to continue with their medication. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants who responded to the 4-week intervention, defined as a reduction of 50 or more in IBS-SSS relative to baseline, and was analysed per modified intention-to-treat (ie, all participants who started the intervention). Safety was analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02970591, and is complete. FINDINGS: Between Jan 24, 2017, and Sept 2, 2021, 1104 participants were assessed for eligibility and 304 were randomly assigned. Ten participants did not receive their intervention after randomisation and thus 294 participants were included in the modified intention-to-treat population (96 assigned to the LFTD diet, 97 to the low-carbohydrate diet, and 101 to optimised medical treatment). 241 (82%) of 294 participants were women and 53 (18%) were men and the mean age was 38 (SD 13). After 4 weeks, 73 (76%) of 96 participants in the LFTD diet group, 69 (71%) of 97 participants in the low-carbohydrate diet group, and 59 (58%) of 101 participants in the optimised medical treatment group had a reduction of 50 or more in IBS-SSS compared with baseline, with a significant difference between the groups (p=0·023). 91 (95%) of 96 participants completed 4 weeks in the LFTD group, 92 (95%) of 97 completed 4 weeks in the low-carbohydrate group, and 91 (90%) of 101 completed 4 weeks in the optimised medical treatment group. Two individuals in each of the intervention groups stated that adverse events were the reason for discontinuing the 4-week intervention. Five (5%) of 91 participants in the optimised medical treatment group stopped treatment prematurely due to side-effects. No serious adverse events or treatment-related deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION: Two 4-week dietary interventions and optimised medical treatment reduced the severity of IBS symptoms, with a larger effect size in the diet groups. Dietary interventions might be considered as an initial treatment for patients with IBS. Research is needed to enable personalised treatment strategies.

The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of a low FODMAP diet supplemented with L-tryptophan (TRP) on its metabolism and symptoms of functional constipation in elderly patients. (2) Methods: This study included 40 people without abdominal complaints (Group I, controls) and 60 patients with FC, diagnosed according to the Rome IV Criteria (Group II). Two groups were randomly selected: Group IIA (n = 30) was qualified for administration of the low FODMAP diet, and the diet of patients of Group IIB (n = 30) was supplemented with 1000 mg TRP per day. The severity of abdominal symptoms was assessed with an abdominal pain index ranging from 1 to 7 points (S-score). The concentration of TRP and its metabolites, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), kynurenine (KYN), and 3-indoxyl sulfate (3-IS) in urine were determined using the LC-MS/MS method. (3) Results: In Group II, 5-HIAA concentration in urine was lower, and KYN and 3-IS concentrations were higher than in the control group. A negative correlation was found between the S-score and urinary concentration of 5-HIAA (p < 0.001), and 3-IS concentration was positively correlated with the S-score. However, the correlation between the S-score and 3-IS concentration was negative (p < 0.01). After a dietary intervention, 5-HIAA concentration increased in both groups, and the severity of symptoms decreased, but the decrease was more pronounced in Group IIB. (4) Conclusion: A low FODMAP diet supplemented with L-tryptophan has beneficial effects in elderly patients suffering from functional constipation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: The efficacy of a low fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is well established. After the elimination period, a reintroduction phase aims to identify triggers. We studied the impact of a blinded reintroduction using FODMAP powders to objectively identify triggers and evaluated the effect on symptoms, quality of life, and psychosocial comorbidities. METHODS: Responders to a 6-week low FODMAP diet, defined by a drop in IBS symptom severity score (IBS-SSS) compared with baseline, entered a 9-week blinded randomized reintroduction phase with 6 FODMAP powders (fructans, fructose, galacto-oligosaccharides, lactose, mannitol, sorbitol) or control (glucose). A rise in IBS-SSS (≥50 points) defined a FODMAP trigger. Patients completed daily symptom diaries and questionnaires for quality of life and psychosocial comorbidities. RESULTS: In 117 recruited patients with IBS, IBS-SSS improved significantly after the elimination period compared with baseline (150 ± 116 vs 301 ± 97, P < .0001, 80% responders). Symptom recurrence was triggered in 85% of the FODMAP powders, by an average of 2.5 ± 2 FODMAPs/patient. The most prevalent triggers were fructans (56%) and mannitol (54%), followed by galacto-oligosaccharides, lactose, fructose, sorbitol, and glucose (respectively 35%, 28%, 27%, 23%, and 26%) with a significant increase in abdominal pain at day 1 for sorbitol/mannitol, day 2 for fructans/galacto-oligosaccharides, and day 3 for lactose. CONCLUSION: We confirmed the significant benefit of the low FODMAP diet in tertiary-care IBS. A blinded reintroduction revealed a personalized pattern of symptom recurrence, with fructans and mannitol as the most prevalent, and allows the most objective identification of individual FODMAP triggers.

Academic Search Ultimate, APA PsychINFO, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science were searched for original research documenting differences in microbiota in MDD or changes with a low FODMAP diet in adults (age 18 years +). Studies with fecal microbiota, 16 s RNA sequencing and QIIME pipelines were included. Studies using antibiotics, probiotics, and medications such as antidepressants were excluded. Additionally, studies based on a single gender were excluded as gender impacts microbiota changes in MDD. Four studies addressed differences in microbiota with MDD and another four assessed shifts occurring with a low FODMAP diet. The abundance of Bacteroidetes, Bacteroidaceae and Bacteroides were lower in individuals with MDD but increased with a low FODMAP diet. Abundance of Ruminoccaceae was lower and Bilophila was higher with both a low FODMAP diet and MDD. These results provide preliminary evidence that a low FODMAP diet might drive changes in microbiota that also benefit people with MDD. Further research to assess whether a low FODMAP diet can treat MDD through modification of targeted microbiota is warranted."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Migraine and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can be difficult-to-treat comorbidities that may be driven by underlying gut-brain axis dysfunction. This report describes utilization of a low-FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) diet (LFD) in a patient with refractory migraine and co-occurring IBS. METHODS: After unremarkable physical and neurological examinations, a 57-year-old woman with IBS and chronic migraine was started on a LFD under the guidance of a registered dietician. Psychometrically validated surveys administered at baseline and initial follow-up assessed patient-reported outcomes related to migraine and IBS symptoms. RESULTS: At baseline, the patient reported 80/90 migraine days with average pain of 8/10, a Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) score of 33, and Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6) score of 64, the latter 2 scores indicating severe disability. Baseline IBS symptom severity was noted at 9/10. Within 1 week on a LFD, the patient's IBS symptoms and migraines improved in both frequency and intensity of episodes. After 5 weeks on a LFD elimination, the patient's clinical improvement continued and she reported significant reduction in migraines, with average pain of 1/10 and IBS severity of 3/10. The patient also improved from severe to minimal levels of disability on validated measures (MIDAS, HIT-6, and IBS Patient Global Impression of Change). CONCLUSION: This is the first case report detailing successful initial treatment of migraine and co-occurring IBS utilizing a dietician-guided LFD. There are a number of important reasons for potential improvement in these gut-brain axis disorders which are reviewed as well as an implication for long-term management and food reintroduction. Larger, randomized trials evaluating a LFD in diverse individuals with migraine and co-occurring IBS are warranted to help confirm these results.",

      "abstract": "The literature about the association of branched short-chain fatty acids (BCFAs) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is limited. BCFAs, the bacterial products of the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids, are proposed as markers for colonic protein fermentation. IBS is a gastrointestinal disorder characterized by low-grade inflammation and intestinal dysbiosis. The low-FODMAP diet (LFD) has increasingly been applied as first-line therapy for managing IBS symptoms, although it decreases the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), well known for their anti-inflammatory action. In parallel, high protein consumption increases BCFAs. Protein fermentation alters the colonic microbiome through nitrogenous metabolites production, known for their detrimental effects on the intestinal barrier promoting inflammation. Purpose: This review aims to explore the role of BCFAs on gut inflammation in patients with IBS and the impact of LFD in BCFAs production. Methods: A literature search was carried out using a combination of terms in scientific databases. Results: The included studies have contradictory findings about how BCFAs affect the intestinal health of IBS patients. Conclusions: Although evidence suggests that BCFAs may play a protective role in gut inflammation, other metabolites of protein fermentation are associated with gut inflammation. Further research is needed in order to clarify how diet protein composition and, consequently, the BCFAs are implicated in IBS pathogenesis or in symptoms management with LFD+."

      "abstract": "A diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) improves functional bowel symptoms and is a second-line dietary management strategy for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The diet is complex and involves three stages: restriction, reintroduction and personalisation and clinical effectiveness is achieved with dietitian-led education; however, this is not always available. The aim of this review is to provide an update on the evidence for using the low FODMAP diet, with a focus on the impact of FODMAP restriction and reintroduction considering long-term management of IBS in a clinical setting. Randomised controlled trials have assessed symptom response, quality of life, dietary intake and changes to the gut microbiota during FODMAP restriction. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses consistently report that FODMAP restriction has a better symptom response compared with control diets and a network analysis reports the low FODMAP diet is superior to other dietary treatments for IBS. Research focused on FODMAP reintroduction and personalisation is limited and of lower quality, however common dietary triggers include wheat, onion, garlic, pulses and milk. Dietitian-led delivery of the low FODMAP diet is not always available and alternative education delivery methods, e.g. webinars, apps and leaflets, are available but remove the personalised approach and may be less acceptable to patients and may introduce safety concerns in terms of nutritional adequacy. Predicting response to the low FODMAP diet using symptom severity or a biomarker is of great interest. More evidence on less restrictive approaches and non-dietitian-led education delivery methods are needed.",

AIMS: To determine if differences in baseline faecal microbiota or faecal and urine metabolite profiles may separate clinical responders to the diet from non-responders allowing predictive algorithms to be proposed. METHODS: We recruited adults fulfilling Rome III criteria for IBS to a blinded randomised controlled trial. Patients were randomised to sham diet with a placebo supplement (control) or LFD supplemented with either placebo (LFD) or 1.8 g/d B-galactooligosaccharide (LFD/B-GOS), for 4 weeks. Clinical response was defined as adequate symptom relief at 4 weeks after the intervention (global symptom question). Differences between responders and non-responders in faecal microbiota (FISH, 16S rRNA sequencing) and faecal (gas-liquid chromatography, gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry) and urine (1 H NMR) metabolites were analysed. RESULTS: At 4 weeks, clinical response differed across the 3groups with adequate symptom relief of 30% (7/23) in controls, 50% (11/22) in the LFD group and 67% (16/24) in the LFD/B-GOS group (p = 0.048). In the control and the LFD/B-GOS groups, microbiota and metabolites did not separate responders from non-responders. In the LFD group, higher baseline faecal propionate (sensitivity 91%, specificity 89%) and cyclohexanecarboxylic acid esters (sensitivity 80%, specificity 78%), and urine metabolite profile (Q2 0.296 vs. randomised -0.175) predicted clinical response. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline faecal and urine metabolites may predict response to the LFD.",

      "abstract": "(1) Background: A low-FODMAP diet is often recommended in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, but it does not improve abdominal symptoms in all patients, and an alternative diet is desirable. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a low-FODMAP diet with a concomitant reduction in tryptophan (TRP) intake in irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea predominance (IBS-D) in relation to its metabolism via the serotonin and kynurenine pathways. (2) Methods: 40 healthy people (Group I, Controls) and 80 patients with IBS-D were included in the study. IBS-D patients were randomly divided into two groups of 40 each (Groups IIA and IIB). In Group IIA, the low-FODMAP diet was recommended, while in Group IIB, the same diet was recommended but with limited TRP intake for 8 weeks. The TRP intake was analyzed with the use of the nutritional calculator. Abdominal complaints were assessed using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS-IBS), and psychological status was simultaneously determined using two scales: the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) and the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D). TRP and its metabolites: 5-hydoxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KYNA), and quinolinic acid (QA) were measured in urine using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). (3) Results: The consumption of TRP per mg/kg/b.w./24 h has decreased in Group IIA from 20.9 ± 2.39 to 17.45 ± 2.41 (16.5%) and in Group IIB from 21.3 ± 2.33 to 14.32 (34.4%). Significantly greater improvement was found after nutritional treatment in patients in Group IIB as compared to Group IIA (GSRS score: 38.1% vs. 49.8%; HAM-A: 38.7% vs. 49.9%; HAM-D: 13.8% vs. 35.0%; p < 0.01). Reducing TRP intake showed a negative correlation with the degree of improvement in the GSRS score. (4) Conclusions: Lowering the TRP content in a low-FODMAP diet may be useful in treating IBS-D.",

      "abstract": "Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a frequent disorder of gut-brain interaction, affecting 5-7% of people globally, with significant impairment in quality of life. The management of FD is challenging due to the lack of specific therapeutic approaches. Although food seems to play a role in symptom production, its pathophysiologic role in patients with FD is not fully understood. Most FD patients report that their symptoms are triggered by food, especially in the post-prandial distress syndrome (PDS) group, although evidence to support the use of dietary interventions are limited. FODMAPs can increase production of gas in the intestinal lumen, through fermentation by intestinal bacteria, can exert osmotic effects by increasing water volume and can cause an excessive production of short-chain fatty acids (propionate, butyrate, and acetate). Emerging scientific evidence, confirmed by recent clinical trials, suggest that FODMAPs could be involved in the pathogenesis of FD. Given the consolidated approach of the Low-FODMAP Diet (LFD) in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) management and emerging scientific evidence regarding the LFD in FD, a therapeutic role of this diet may be hypothesized also in FD, either alone or in combination with other therapies.",

      "abstract": "(1) Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a global public health problem, the pathogenesis of which has not been fully explored. Limiting fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) can relieve symptoms in some patients with IBS. Studies have shown that normal microcirculation perfusion is necessary to maintain the primary function of the gastrointestinal system. Here, we hypothesized that IBS pathogenesis might be related to abnormalities in colonic microcirculation. A low-FODMAP diet could alleviate visceral hypersensitivity (VH) by improving colonic microcirculation; (2) Methods: C57BL/6 mice were raised to establish an IBS-like rodent model using water avoidance (WA) stress or SHAM-WA as a control, one hour per day for ten days. The mice in the WA group were administered different levels of the FODMAP diet: 2.1% regular FODMAP (WA-RF), 10% high FODMAP diet (WA-HF), 5% medium FODMAP diet (WA-MF), and 0% low FODMAP diet (WA-LF) for the following 14 days. The body weight and food consumption of the mice were recorded. Visceral sensitivity was measured as colorectal distention (CRD) using the abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) score. Colonic microcirculation was assessed using laser speckle contrast imaging (LCSI). Vascular endothelial-derived growth factor (VEGF) was detected using immunofluorescence staining; (3) Results: The threshold values of CRD pressure in the WA-RF, WA-HF, and WA-MF groups were significantly lower than those in the SHAM-WA group. Moreover, we observed that colonic microcirculation perfusion decreased, and the expression of VEGF protein increased in these three groups of mice. Interestingly, a low-FODMAP dietary intervention could reverse this situation. Specifically, a low-FODMAP diet increased colonic microcirculation perfusion, reduced VEGF protein expression in mice, and increased the threshold of VH. There was a significant positive correlation between colonic microcirculation and threshold for VH; (4) Conclusions: These results demonstrate that a low-FODMAP diet can alter VH by affecting colonic microcirculation. Changes in intestinal microcirculation may be related to VEGF expression.",

Ingested food plays a key role in the pathophysiology of disorders of gut-brain interaction as up to 84% of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) report food-triggered symptoms. Potential pathogenetic mechanisms of food-related symptoms in these patients are discussed, focusing on bloating and abdominal distension. These mechanisms provide the rationale for dietary treatment in patients with functional abdominal bloating and distension. The role of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) and gluten in functional abdominal bloating and distension is examined. Current literature evaluating the efficacy of the low-FODMAP diet and the gluten-free diet in abdominal bloating and distension is analyzed. Available evidence originates mainly from studies on patients with IBS, since clinical studies on selected cohorts of patients with only functional abdominal bloating and distension have been missing to date. Promising evidence on the potential efficacy of the low-FODMAP diet in functional abdominal bloating and distension is provided by the reduction of the bloating observed in patients with IBS. Regarding the gluten-free diet, there is insufficient evidence to recommend it to reduce bloating and abdominal distension. In conclusion, this review asserts the need for a close collaboration with experts in nutrition to optimize the management of these patients and reduce the risks associated with elimination diets."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) can provoke symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We aimed to compare the effects of diets with low vs. moderate FODMAP content on gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and bowel habits, and to identify possible predictors of clinical response to a low FODMAP diet and FODMAP sensitivity in IBS. METHODS: Adult participants with IBS (Rome IV criteria, n = 29) were included and adhered to two 7-day diet periods, with either low (4 g/day) or moderate (23 g/day) amounts of FODMAPs, in this randomized, double-blind, crossover study. The periods were separated by a wash-out period (≥14 days). IBS-Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) and a stool diary (Bristol Stool Form) were completed before and after the diet periods. At baseline, severity of GI symptoms and gut microbial fermentation were assessed (every 15 min, 4 h) during the Lactulose Nutrient Challenge Test (LNCT). Clinical response and FODMAP sensitivity were defined by reduction after low FODMAP period, and increase after moderate FODMAP period in IBS-SSS (≥50 points), respectively. RESULTS: Severity of GI symptoms (P = 0.04), stool consistency (P = 0.01), and stool frequency (P = 0.01) differed between the interventions, with reduced overall GI symptom severity, abdominal pain intensity and frequency, bowel habits dissatisfaction, and daily life interference (P < 0.05 for all), as well as more firm (P = 0.03) and less frequent (P < 0.01) stools after low FODMAP intervention, but not after moderate FODMAP intervention. A third (34%) responded clinically to the low FODMAP diet, and the response could be predicted by higher IBS-SSS at baseline (P = 0.02). Although modest associations between FODMAP sensitivity (22%) and GI symptoms during LNCT were observed, no independent predictors could be identified. CONCLUSIONS: A diet low in FODMAPs reduces GI symptoms and affects bowel habits in IBS, compared with a moderate FODMAP diet. Assessment of IBS severity before the intervention may be used to predict clinical response to a low FODMAP diet. Trial registry (http://www.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a low-FODMAP diet in patients who meet the diagnostic criteria for IBS whilst in IBD remission. A total of 200 patients in remission of IBD were included in the study. Sixty-five of these patients (32.5%) were diagnosed with IBS according to the R4DQ. On the patients who met the IBS diagnostic criteria, anthropometric measurements, laboratory tests and lactulose hydrogen breath tests were performed. A low-FODMAP diet was introduced for 6 weeks. Of the 59 patients with IBS diagnosed at baseline for whom data were collected at the end of follow-up, after the low-FODMAP intervention IBS-like symptoms were not present in 66.1% (n = 39) (95% CI (53.4%; 76.9%)). The difference between the two groups (with SIBO at baseline (33 of 48 patients) and without SIBO at baseline (6 of 11 patients)) in the low-FODMAP diet's effectiveness was not statistically significant (p = 0.586). The low-FODMAP diet improved the gut symptoms of flatulence and diarrhea. It had no effect on the occurrence of constipation. In IBD patients in remission who meet the IBS criteria, the dietary intervention of a low-FODMAP diet is effective for a reduction in IBS-like symptoms, regardless of the coexistence of bacterial overgrowth.",

Recent studies suggested an association between non-celiac gluten sensitivity and the consumption of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP). This systematic review aimed to examine literature evidence on the relationship between non-celiac gluten sensitivity and FODMAP intake. A comprehensive search was carried out for randomised clinical trials addressing gastrointestinal symptoms as the primary outcome, published between 2010 and 2020 in Portuguese, English or Spanish, and indexed in Scopus, PubMed, SciELO, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Embase or VHL (LILACS) databases. The systematic review was performed using the population, intervention, comparison and outcome (PICO) framework. A total of 1133 articles were retrieved for further assessment. Three articles were selected for systematic review, one of which included two interventions with different periods and assessments. Quality of evidence was assessed according to the GRADE protocol. The selected articles used different instruments to measure gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life, hindering comparison of data. Clinical trials identified an association between decreased gastrointestinal symptoms and FODMAP restriction. There are few studies on the topic, and those available used different instruments to assess gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life. Nevertheless, current evidence supports the gluten-free diet still represents first-line therapy. However, a FODMAP restriction can decrease gastrointestinal symptoms in individuals with non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Further research is needed to confirm this finding.",

We conducted this study to determine the impact of a low FODMAP diet (LFD) on the gut microbiota and the efficacy of FMT in the treatment of IBS-D. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a single-arm open-label prospective study was conducted to investigate the impact of FMT alone (n = 40) and FMT+LFD (n = 40) in refractory IBS-D. The IBS-quality of life (QOL), IBS-severity scoring system (SSS), gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS), Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA), and Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) were used to evaluate the efficacy, and partial 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing was used to profile the microbiota. RESULTS: The response rates were higher in the FMT+LFD group than in the FMT group (1 mo, 3 mo, 6 mo: 70.0% vs. 55.0%, 67.5% vs. 57.5%, 62.5% vs. 27.5%, respectively). The FMT+LFD group showed significantly better improvement in IBS-QOL at 1, 3, and 6 months; IBS-SSS at 6 months; and GSRS at 1 month compared to FMT alone. Changes in HAMA and HAMD were similar in the two groups. The LFD significantly upregulated the FMT-induced microbial diversity (OTUs: 666 vs. 574, Adonis: P = 0.02) and significantly strengthened the upregulation of Bacteroides, Alistipes, and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-002 and the downregulation of Bifidobacterium. CONCLUSION: An LFD enhanced the efficacy of FMT, increased the gut microbial diversity after FMT, and strengthened the inhibitory effect of FMT on conditional pathogens.",

Those presenting these neuropathological conditions share common aspects in terms of gut microbiota composition. The use of microbiota intervention strategies may be an approach to consider in the management of these cases. We describe the case of a 17-year-old girl affected by ASD, reduced growth, neurological development delay, mutations in the PGM1 and EEF1A2 genes (in the absence of clinically manifested disease) and, intestinal disorders such as abdominal pain and diarrhea associated with weight loss. As she demonstrated poor responsiveness to the therapies provided, we attempted two specific dietary patterns: a ketogenic diet, followed by a low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet, with the aim of improving her neurological, metabolic, and intestinal symptoms through modulation of the gut microbiota's composition. The ketogenic diet (KD) provided a reduction in Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria. Although her intestinal symptoms improved, KD was poorly tolerated. On the other hand, the passage to a low FODMAPs diet produced a significant improvement in all neurological, intestinal, and metabolic symptoms and was well-tolerated. The following gut microbiota analysis showed reductions in Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Lactobacilli, and Bifidobacteria. The alpha biodiversity was consistently increased and the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio decreased, reducing the extent of fermentative dysbiosis. Gut microbiota could be a therapeutic target to improve ASD-related symptoms. Further studies are needed to better understand the correlation between gut microbiota composition and ASD, and its possible involvement in the physiopathology of ASD.",

      "abstract": "Diseases affecting the gastrointestinal tract such as functional gastrointestinal diseases – including irritable bowel syndrome – as well as inflammatory bowel diseases are on the rise in Hungary. More and more nutritional recommendations are emerging as part of the therapy, but so far there is no uniform recommendation for the dietary management of these gastrointestinal diseases. Among the dietary recommendations that have been made so far, the low FODMAP diet is noteworthy. FODMAP itself stands for the abbreviation of the initials of fermentable, short-chain, poorly absorbable carbohydrates: fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP). The low FODMAP diet is a scientifically and clinically proven therapeutic recommendation, which is supported in Hungary by the Ministry of Human Resources Guideline (2020). Research has shown that the low FODMAP diet has been shown to reduce gastrointestinal symptoms. The diet consists of 3 phases, the first of which is a step-by-step list of trigger and non-trigger foods that the doctor, with the help of a dietitian, determines. As this stage of the diet can be the most challenging, it is worth emphasizing that it should be developed in collaboration with a dietitian. The aim of the diet is to find a balance between keeping symptoms at a low level and expanding the diet. Low FODMAP diet has been shown to be an effective, successful, and accepted nutritional intervention in the management of symptoms of functional and inflammatory bowel disease. Its use can improve the success of pharmacological interventions and increase patient compliance, hence the need to expand the widespread dissemination of the diet. A mobile app developed by a research team at Monash University will support self-management and practical implementation of the diet and increase adherence to nutritional therapy.",

IBS with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D) represents a therapeutic challenge. Dietary changes or restrictions are most commonly used by patients in an attempt at symptom control. Therefore, a number of diets, especially low-FODMAP diet, have increasingly gained interest as a therapy for IBS-D or mixed IBS. However, this kind of diet, while effective, is not exempt of problems. It is therefore necessary that other therapeutic options be considered while bearing pathophysiological mechanisms and general symptom management in mind.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease whose etiology is not yet fully understood, and their course is characterized by periods of exacerbation and remission. In quite a few cases, actual disease remission may also accompany with inflammatory bowel disease (IBS)-like symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, and diarrhea, may greatly impact quality of life. An army of strong evidence to support the FODMAPs diet (LFD) compounds as an effective dietary approach to IBS treatment. However, there is no significant evidence showing the effectiveness of LFD in treating quiescent IBD and its side effects; this lack of evidence is also an important factor hindering its promotion in the treatment of IBD and its complications. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis will evaluate the efficacy and safety of LFD in the treatment of quiescent IBD patients with IBS-like symptoms. METHOD: We searched the following databases from their establishment until December 2021: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang databases. No restrictions regarding publication date or language were applied. Keywords such as \"Crohn's disease,\" \"ulcerative colitis,\" \"inflammatory bowel disease,\" and \"FODMAPs\" have been combined for search. Ongoing and unpublished research in the Clinical Trials Registry Research will also be included. At the same time, we will manually search all reference lists from relevant systematic reviews for other eligible studies. The selected studies were randomized controlled clinical trials. We will meta-analyze the selected literature by Review Manager software (REVMAN v5.4 Cochrane Collaboration). Two researchers will independently review the research selection, data extraction, and research quality assessments. Finally, we will observe the outcome measures. RESULTS: This study will provide evidence-based data for TFD treatment of IBD and provide new treatment options for future clinical applications. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol of the systematic review does not require ethical approval because it does not involve humans. This article will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at relevant conferences. REGISTRATION NUMBER: INPLASY202220060.",

A diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) is now considered by many a first-line treatment option for IBS, as it has been found to be superior to alternative dietary interventions. However, concerns have been raised as restricting fermentable carbohydrates might result in nutritional deficits or alter composition and function of the gut microbiome in the long term. The study by Staudacher et al., published in this issue of the journal, is the first prospective study to follow IBS patients after completing all three phases of the low FODMAPs diet (restriction, reintroduction, and personalization), demonstrating that this is safe and effective in long-term, when patients are supervised by a dietician. This mini-review provides an up-to-date overview of the use of fermentable carbohydrate's restrictions for symptom management in IBS patients, while summarizing the current knowledge on the possible mechanisms of action behind low fermentable carbohydrate diet efficacy.",

We performed a randomized trial comparing traditional dietary advice (TDA) against the low FODMAP diet (LFD) and gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Patients with Rome IV-defined non-constipated IBS were randomized to TDA, LFD, or GFD (the latter allowing for minute gluten cross-contamination). The primary end point was clinical response after 4 weeks of dietary intervention, as defined by ≥50-point reduction in IBS symptom severity score (IBS-SSS). Secondary end points included (1) changes in individual IBS-SSS items within clinical responders, (2) acceptability and food-related quality of life with dietary therapy, (3) changes in nutritional intake, (4) alterations in stool dysbiosis index, and (5) baseline factors associated with clinical response. RESULTS: The primary end point of ≥50-point reduction in IBS-SSS was met by 42% (n = 14/33) undertaking TDA, 55% (n = 18/33) for LFD, and 58% (n = 19/33) for GFD (P = .43). Responders had similar improvements in IBS-SSS items regardless of their allocated diet. Individuals found TDA cheaper (P < .01), less time-consuming to shop (P < .01), and easier to follow when eating out (P = .03) than the GFD and LFD. TDA was also easier to incorporate into daily life than the LFD (P = .02). Overall reductions in micronutrient and macronutrient intake did not significantly differ across the diets. However, the LFD group had the greatest reduction in total FODMAP content (27.7 g/day before intervention to 7.6 g/day at week 4) compared with the GFD (27.4 g/day to 22.4 g/day) and TDA (24.9 g/day to 15.2 g/day) (P < .01). Alterations in stool dysbiosis index were similar across the diets, with 22%-29% showing reduced dysbiosis, 35%-39% no change, and 35%-40% increased dysbiosis (P = .99). Baseline clinical characteristics and stool dysbiosis index did not predict response to dietary therapy. CONCLUSIONS: TDA, LFD, and GFD are effective approaches in non-constipated IBS, but TDA is the most patient-friendly in terms of cost and convenience. We recommend TDA as the first-choice dietary therapy in non-constipated IBS, with LFD and GFD reserved according to specific patient preferences and specialist dietetic input.

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of low FODMAPs diet with vs. without gluten on clinical symptoms in IBS patients. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial, forty nine IBS patients were randomly assigned to placebo and/or intervention group. Patients in the intervention group received 5 gr/day of gluten powder with low FODMAP diet, while placebo group received 5 gr of rice flour as placebo, with low FODMAP diet. Quality of life (QoL) and IBS-SSS (symptom severity score) were measured before and after the intervention using a valid QoL questionnaire and a standard visual analog scale, respectively. RESULTS: Significant improvements were observed in total scores of IBS-SSS (-32% vs. - 49%), abdominal pain intensity (-45% vs. -52%), and frequency (-26 vs. -46%), abdominal distension (-29% vs. -63%), Interference with community function (-14% vs. -45%) and quality of life (+23 vs. +32%) in both gluten and placebo groups respectively (P < 0.05). Only 5 patients in the gluten-containing diet reported exacerbation of their symptoms. CONCLUSION: Exacerbation of IBS symptoms after wheat and barley consumption is due to their fructan, and not related to their gluten content in most of the patients.

METHODS: This was a single-center, randomized pilot trial of adult patients with FI (Rome III) with at least 1 weekly FI episode associated with loose stool. Eligible patients were randomized to 4 weeks of either a dietitian-led LFD or 6 g/d psyllium treatment. RESULTS: Forty-three subjects were randomized from October 2014 to May 2019. Thirty-seven patients completed the study (19 LFD and 18 psyllium). There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of treatment responders (>50% reduction in FI episodes compared with baseline) for treatment weeks 1-4 (LFD 38.9%, psyllium 50%, P = .33). Compared with baseline, mean fecal incontinence severity index score significantly improved with LFD (39.4 vs 32.6, P = .02) but not with psyllium (35.4 vs 32.1, P = .29). Compared with baseline values, the LFD group reported improvements in fecal incontinence quality of life coping/behavior, depression/self-perception, and embarrassment subscales. The psyllium group reported improvement in incontinence quality of life coping/behavior. DISCUSSION: In this pilot study, there was no difference in the proportion of patients who reported a 50% reduction of FI episodes with the LFD or psyllium. Subjects in the psyllium group reported a greater reduction in overall FI episodes, whereas the LFD group reported consistent improvements in FI severity and quality of life. Further work to understand these apparently discrepant results are warranted but the LFD and psyllium seem to provide viable treatment options for patients with FI and loose stools.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: A gluten-free diet usually leads to mucosal remission in celiac disease, but persistent symptoms are common. A low fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet is an established treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We have assessed the efficacy of a moderately low FODMAP diet on persistent symptoms in treated celiac patients. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was performed from 2018 to 2019 in 70 adults with biopsy-proven celiac disease. Inclusion criteria were as follows: persistent gastrointestinal symptoms defined by a Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS)-IBS version score of 30 or higher, gluten-free diet adherence for 12 months or longer, and serologic and mucosal remission. Participants were randomized to a low FODMAP-gluten-free diet (intervention) or usual gluten-free diet (control). The GSRS-IBS score was recorded at baseline and at weeks 1 to 4, and the Celiac Symptom Index at baseline and at week 4. Statistics included marginal models for repeated data and analyses of covariance. RESULTS: We included 34 participants in the intervention group and 36 in the control group. Time development of GSRS-IBS total scores differed significantly between the groups (Pinteraction < .001), evident after 1 week (mean difference in intervention vs control, -8.2; 95% CI, -11.5 to -5.0) and persisting through week 4 (mean difference in intervention vs control, -10.8; 95% CI, -14.8 to -6.8). Moreover, significantly lower scores were found for the dimensions of pain, bloating, diarrhea, and satiety (Pinteraction ≤ .04), but not constipation (Pinteraction = .43). FODMAP intake during the intervention was moderately low (mean, 8.1 g/d; 95% CI, 6.7-9.3 g/d). The Celiac Symptom Index was significantly lower in the intervention group at week 4 (mean difference, -5.8; 95% CI, -9.6 to -2.0). CONCLUSIONS: A short-term moderately low FODMAP diet significantly reduced gastrointestinal symptoms and increased celiac disease-specific health, and should be considered for the management of persistent symptoms in celiac disease.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common gastrointestinal disorder that is driven by the gutbrain axis and affects 1-20% of the population. Most patients note that various foods elicit abdominal symptoms, and they eliminate these products from their diets. A diet that is low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) is currently one of the mainstays in IBS treatment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge of IBS patients about the disease, treatment and the principles of the low-FODMAP diet that can alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The participants were adults diagnosed with IBS, the inclusion criteria were: absence of comorbidities requiring an elimination diet, age over 18 years, and consent to participate in the study. The respondents filled out an anonymous questionnaire containing questions about the IBS diagnosis, disease history and treatment, as well as 45 questions assessing the participants' knowledge about the low-FODMAP diet. RESULTS: In 28% of the cases, IBS was diagnosed by a general practitioner; in nearly 40% of the cases - by a gastroenterology specialist; in 10% of the cases - by a dietitian, whereas the remaining respondents had arrived at the diagnosis independently or with the help of support groups for IBS patients. After diagnosis, only every fourth respondent sought treatment in a gastroenterology clinic. In the studied population, 237 of the respondents had followed to the low-FODMAP diet, and the differentiating factors were sex (p=0.002), place of residence (city with a population higher than 100,000 vs. rural area; p=0.0001) and education (university vs. vocational school p=0.0043). Respondents who had been recently diagnosed with IBS (less than 12 months vs. more than 12 months before the study) were more likely to follow the FODMAP diet. CONCLUSIONS: The surveyed population was characterized by high levels of knowledge about the low-FODMAP diet, but many respondents did not strictly comply with dietary guidelines, in particular the duration of each dietary phase. Age was significantly correlated with the respondents' knowledge, and the participants' familiarity with low-FODMAP guidelines decreased with age. Nutritional consultations did not significantly improve the respondents' knowledge about the low-FODMAP diet.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The long-term management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) poses many challenges. In short-term studies, eHealth interventions have been demonstrated to be safe and practical for at-home monitoring of the effects of probiotic treatments and a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs). IBS has been linked to alterations in the microbiota. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether a web-based low-FODMAP diet (LFD) intervention and probiotic treatment were equally good at reducing IBS symptoms, and whether the response to treatments could be explained by patients' microbiota. METHODS: Adult IBS patients were enrolled in an open-label, randomized crossover trial (for nonresponders) with 1 year of follow-up using the web application IBS Constant Care (IBS CC). Patients were recruited from the outpatient clinic at the Department of Gastroenterology, North Zealand University Hospital, Denmark. Patients received either VSL#3 for 4 weeks (2 × 450 billion colony-forming units per day) or were placed on an LFD for 4 weeks. Patients responding to the LFD were reintroduced to foods high in FODMAPs, and probiotic responders received treatments whenever they experienced a flare-up of symptoms. Treatment response and symptom flare-ups were defined as a reduction or increase, respectively, of at least 50 points on the IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS). Web-based ward rounds were performed daily by the study investigator. Fecal microbiota were analyzed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing (at least 10 million 2 × 100 bp paired-end sequencing reads per sample). RESULTS: A total of 34 IBS patients without comorbidities and 6 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Taken from participating subjects, 180 fecal samples were analyzed for their microbiota composition. Out of 21 IBS patients, 12 (57%) responded to the LFD and 8 (38%) completed the reintroduction of FODMAPs. Out of 21 patients, 13 (62%) responded to their first treatment of VSL#3 and 7 (33%) responded to multiple VSL#3 treatments. A median of 3 (IQR 2.25-3.75) probiotic treatments were needed for sustained symptom control. LFD responders were reintroduced to a median of 14.50 (IQR 7.25-21.75) high-FODMAP items. No significant difference in the median reduction of IBS-SSS for LFD versus probiotic responders was observed, where for LFD it was -126.50 (IQR -196.75 to -76.75) and for VSL#3 it was -130.00 (IQR -211.00 to -70.50; P>.99). Responses to either of the two treatments were not able to be predicted using patients' microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: The web-based LFD intervention and probiotic treatment were equally efficacious in managing IBS symptoms. The response to treatments could not be explained by the composition of the microbiota. The IBS CC web application was shown to be practical, safe, and useful for clinical decision making in the long-term management of IBS. Although this study was underpowered, findings from this study warrant further research in a larger sample of patients with IBS to confirm these long-term outcomes.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Reducing FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) can be clinically beneficial in IBS but the mechanism is incompletely understood. We aimed to detect microbial signatures that might predict response to the low FODMAP diet and assess whether microbiota compositional and functional shifts could provide insights into its mode of action. DESIGN: We used metagenomics to determine high-resolution taxonomic and functional profiles of the stool microbiota from IBS cases and household controls (n=56 pairs) on their usual diet. Clinical response and microbiota changes were studied in 41 pairs after 4 weeks on a low FODMAP diet. RESULTS: Unsupervised analysis of baseline IBS cases pre-diet identified two distinct microbiota profiles, which we refer to as IBSP (pathogenic-like) and IBSH (health-like) subtypes. IBSP microbiomes were enriched in Firmicutes and genes for amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, but depleted in Bacteroidetes species. IBSH microbiomes were similar to controls. On the low FODMAP diet, IBSH and control microbiota were unaffected, but the IBSP signature shifted towards a health-associated microbiome with an increase in Bacteroidetes (p=0.009), a decrease in Firmicutes species (p=0.004) and normalisation of primary metabolic genes. The clinical response to the low FODMAP diet was greater in IBSP subjects compared with IBSH (p=0.02). CONCLUSION: 50% of IBS cases manifested a 'pathogenic' gut microbial signature. This shifted towards the healthy profile on the low FODMAP diet; and IBSP cases showed an enhanced clinical responsiveness to the dietary therapy. The effectiveness of FODMAP reduction in IBSP may result from the alterations in gut microbiota and metabolites produced. Microbiota signatures could be useful as biomarkers to guide IBS treatment; and investigating IBSP species and metabolic pathways might yield insights regarding IBS pathogenic mechanisms.",

An increasing demand of IBS patient referrals has warranted group FODMAP education led by specialist dietitians. Psychological co-morbidities are common in IBS, although how the low FODMAP diet influences psychological outcomes is not understood. The present study aimed to evaluate symptom related outcomes of the diet following group education and assess its effect on psychological profiles. METHODS: An observational, prospective study was conducted in 55 IBS patients who attended FODMAP Restriction and FODMAP Reintroduction group sessions. Data were collected at baseline and follow-up after FODMAP Restriction and analysed using descriptive and McNemar's tests. Primary outcome was evaluated by IBS Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS). Secondary psychological outcomes included anxiety and depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and risk of eating disorder questionnaire (SCOFF). RESULTS: After FODMAP Restriction, 27 of 55 (54%) patients reported clinically relevant symptom improvement, as defined by a reduction in the IBS-SSS ≥50 points, whereas no differences were recorded in the proportion of patients identified with clinical anxiety (p = 1.000) or clinical depression (p = 0.375). Positively, no increased risk of an eating disorder was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides data supporting the efficacy of the low FODMAP diet in IBS patients who attended dietitian led group education settings in tertiary care. Clinically significant improvements in gastrointestinal symptoms were observed, although with no impact on clinical levels of anxiety, depression or the risk of an eating disorder.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There are various studies showing the relationship between irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and diet, and some dietary adjustments are recommended to reduce symptoms. In recent years, there is a growing number of studies that show a 4-8 wk low fermentable oligo, di- and mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet has a 50%-80% significant effect on symptoms in IBS patients. There is strong evidence suggesting that changes in fecal microbiota have an impact on IBS pathogenesis. Based on this argument, probiotics have been used in IBS treatment for a long time. As is seen, the FODMAP diet and probiotics are used separately in IBS treatment. AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of adding probiotics to a low FODMAP diet to control the symptoms in patients with IBS. METHODS: The patients who were admitted to the Gastroenterology Clinic of Dokuz Eylul University Hospital and diagnosed with IBS according to Rome IV criteria were enrolled into the study. They were randomized into 2 groups each of which consisted of 50 patients. All patients were referred to a dietitian to receive dietary recommendations for the low FODMAP diet with a daily intake of 9 g. The patients were asked to keep a diary of foods and beverages they consumed. The patients in Group 1 were given supplementary food containing probiotics (2 g) once a day in addition to their low FODMAP diet, while the patients in Group 2 were given a placebo once a day in addition to their low FODMAP diet. Visual analogue scale (VAS), the Bristol Stool Scale and IBS Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS) scores were evaluated before and after the 21 d treatment. RESULTS: The rate of adherence of 85 patients, who completed the study, to the FODMAP restricted diet was 92%, being 90% in Group 1 and 94% in Group 2. The mean scores of VAS and IBS-SSS of the patients in Group 1 before treatment were 4.6 ± 2.7 and 310.0 ± 78.4, respectively, and these scores decreased to 2.0 ± 1.9 and 172.0 ± 93.0 after treatment (both P < 0.001). The mean VAS and IBS-SSS scores of the patients in Group 2 before treatment were 4.7 ± 2.7 and 317.0 ± 87.5, respectively, and these scores decreased to 1.8 ± 2.0 and 175.0 ± 97.7 after treatment (both P < 0.001). The IBS-SSS score of 37 patients (86.04%) in Group 1 and 36 patients (85.71%) in Group 2 decreased by more than 50 points. Group 1 and Group 2 were similar in terms of differences in VAS and IBS-SSS scores before and after treatment. When changes in stool shape after treatment were compared using the Bristol Stool Scale, both groups showed significant change. CONCLUSION: This study is the randomized controlled study to examine the efficiency of probiotic supplementation to a low FODMAP diet in all subtypes of IBS. The low FODMAP diet has highly positive effects on symptoms of all subtypes of IBS. It was seen that adding probiotics to a low FODMAP diet does not make an additional contribution to symptom response and adherence to the diet."

      "abstract": "Aims: To compare the effects of Ayurvedic and conventional nutritional therapy in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Methods: Sixty-nine patients with IBS were randomized to Ayurvedic (n = 35) or conventional nutritional therapy according to the recommendations of the German Nutrition Society including the low-FODMAP diet (n = 34). Study visits took place at baseline and after 1, 3, and 6 months. The primary outcome was IBS symptom severity (IBS-SSS) after 3 months; secondary outcomes included stress (CPSS), anxiety and depression (HADS), well-being (WHO-5) and IBS-specific quality of life (IBS-QOL). A repeated measures general linear model (GLM) for intent-to-treat-analyses was applied in this explorative study. Results: After 3 months, estimated marginal means for IBS-SSS reductions were 123.8 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 92.8-154.9; p < 0.001] in the Ayurvedic and 72.7 (95% CI = 38.8-106.7; p < 0.001) in the conventional group. The IBS-SSS reduction was significantly higher in the Ayurveda group compared to the conventional therapy group (estimated marginal mean = 51.1; 95% CI = 3.8-98.5; p = 0.035) and clinically meaningful. Sixty-eight percentage of the variance in IBS-SSS reduction after 3 months can be explained by treatment, 6.5% by patients' expectations for their therapies and 23.4% by IBS-SSS at pre-intervention. Both therapies are equivalent in their contribution to the outcome variance. The higher the IBS-SSS score at pre-intervention and the larger the patients' expectations, the greater the IBS-SSS reduction. There were no significant group differences in any secondary outcome measures. No serious adverse events occurred in either group. Conclusion: Patients with IBS seem to benefit significantly from Ayurvedic or conventional nutritional therapy. The results warrant further studies with longer-term follow-ups and larger sample sizes. Clinical Trial Registration:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03019861, identifier: NCT03019861."

The aim of this study was to investigate clinical symptoms, nutrient intake, and microbiota of patients with IBS 12 months after starting a low FODMAP diet. METHODS: Participants enrolled in a previous short-term clinical trial and who had been through structured FODMAP restriction, reintroduction, and personalization were invited to participate in a follow-up study at one time point at 12 months. Gastrointestinal symptoms, stool output, dietary intake, and quality of life were recorded. Stool samples were collected and analyzed for microbiota (qPCR) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Data were compared with baseline (prior to any intervention in the original clinical trial) using non-parametric statistics. KEY RESULTS: Eighteen participants were included in the study. Adequate relief of symptoms occurred in 5/18 (28%) at baseline and increased to 12/18 (67%) following long-term personalized low FODMAP diet (p = 0.039). There was a reduction in IBS-SSS total score between baseline (median 227, IQR 99) and long term (154, 89; p < 0.001). Bifidobacteria abundance was not different between baseline (median 9.29 log10 rRNA genes/g, IQR 1.45) and long term (9.20 log10 rRNA genes/g, 1.41; p = 0.766, q = 0.906); however, there were lower concentrations of total SCFA, acetate, propionate, and butyrate. CONCLUSIONS: In this long-term analysis, two thirds of patients reported adequate relief of symptoms after 12 months of personalized low FODMAP diet that did not result in differences from baseline in Bifidobacteria. FODMAP reintroduction and personalization may normalize some of the effects of short-term FODMAP restriction.",

However, although the impact of a low FODMAP diet on individual IBS symptoms has been examined in some randomised controlled trials (RCTs), there has been no recent systematic assessment, and individual trials have studied numerous alternative or control interventions, meaning the best comparator is unclear. We performed a network meta-analysis addressing these uncertainties. DESIGN: We searched the medical literature through to 2 April 2021 to identify RCTs of a low FODMAP diet in IBS. Efficacy was judged using dichotomous assessment of improvement in global IBS symptoms or improvement in individual IBS symptoms, including abdominal pain, abdominal bloating or distension, and bowel habit. Data were pooled using a random effects model, with efficacy reported as pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs, and interventions ranked according to their P-score. RESULTS: We identified 13 eligible RCTs (944 patients). Based on failure to achieve an improvement in global IBS symptoms, a low FODMAP diet ranked first vs habitual diet (RR of symptoms not improving=0.67; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.91, P-score=0.99), and was superior to all other interventions. Low FODMAP diet ranked first for abdominal pain severity, abdominal bloating or distension severity and bowel habit, although for the latter it was not superior to any other intervention. A low FODMAP diet was superior to British Dietetic Association (BDA)/National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) dietary advice for abdominal bloating or distension (RR=0.72; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.94). BDA/NICE dietary advice was not superior to any other intervention in any analysis. CONCLUSION: In a network analysis, low FODMAP diet ranked first for all endpoints studied. However, most trials were based in secondary or tertiary care and did not study effects of FODMAP reintroduction and personalisation on symptoms.",

It remains unknown which disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) patients would benefit most from LFD. We aimed to analyze LFD response regarding a preceding nutrient challenge test (NCT). METHODS: Data of 110 consecutive DGBI patients undergoing NCT and LFD between August 2015 and August 2018 were analyzed retrospectively. LFD response was assessed by changes in IBS Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS). In mixed-effects linear regression models, the impact of hydrogen values and abdominal symptoms during NCT, performed with 30-g lactulose and 400-mL liquid test meal, on IBS-SSS changes were analyzed. RESULTS: Low FODMAP diet induced a significant IBS-SSS reduction of 78 points (95% confidence interval [CI] 50-96; P < 0.001). Patients with higher NCT-induced hydrogen increase during proximal intestinal transit had a significantly better LFD response (-66 IBS-SSS reduction per 10-ppm hydrogen increase, 95% CI -129 to -4, P = 0.045). Additionally, the higher the NCT-induced maximum hydrogen increase during mid-distal and distal intestinal transit, the better are the responses to LFD (-6 IBS-SSS per 10-ppm maximum delta hydrogen, 95% CI -11 to -1, P = 0.040). There was no association of LFD response with abdominal symptom generation during NCT. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first one analyzing and demonstrating significant associations between NCT results and LFD response. These findings are of high clinical importance, as they identify a subgroup of DGBI patients that may profit most from a restrictive LFD as first-line therapy.",

IBS patients report that FODMAP (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols) diet induce or exacerbate their symptoms. It has been reported that low-FODMAP diet (LFD) improves the symptoms in 50%-80% of IBS patients. We aimed to identify IBS responders and non-responders' patients to LFD by determining baseline fecal microbial composition, sequencing the 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 region. Thirty-two participants with IBS were included, 29 women (90.62%) and three men (9.37%), and instructed to follow a four-week LFD, Visual Analogue Scale for IBS was used to assess intervention response. Twenty-two participants were responders (68.75%), and ten were non-responders (31.25%). Differential abundance analysis of Amplicon Sequence Variant (ASVs), before LFD, identified Prevotella 9 and Veillonella genus in responder group, and Barnesiella, Paraprevotella, Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcus 1 genus in non-responder group. After LFD, differentially abundant ASVs were only identified in R, belonging to Veilonella, Butyrivibrio, and 5 ASVs belonging to Ruminiclostridium 6 genus. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), was used to classify patients by responsiveness, considering baseline abundance of 5 bacterial genera, LDA accuracy model was 96.87%, correctly classifying 95.45% of in responder group and 100% and non-responder group. In conclusion, bacterial biomarkers are useful to classify IBS individuals by responsiveness to LFD.",

A diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) is widely used in adults and children with FAPD, despite limited available evidence. We aim to systematically review evidence on the efficacy and safety of using a low-FODMAP diet for the management of children with FAPD. METHODS: The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and MEDLINE databases will be searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compare the use a low-FODMAP diet (preferably a 3-step low-FODMAP diet but also only a strict low-FODMAP diet or restriction of individual FODMAPs) with any comparator (i.e., standardized [i.e., average national] or other diet or no intervention) in children with FAPD (regardless of the definition). Each FAPD and each low-FODMAP diet or individual FODMAP restriction will be assessed separately. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias will be used. The primary outcome will be the abdominal pain intensity. The secondary outcomes will be abdominal pain frequency, stool consistency, other gastrointestinal symptoms, school performance, and psychological functioning associated with FAPD, parent's work absenteeism associated with FAPD of a child, health-related quality of life, compliance, growth, and adverse events. The findings will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and submitted to relevant conferences. CONCLUSION: This systematic review of rigorous methodological design will update current evidence on the efficacy and safety of using a low-FODMAP diet. However, it may be limited by the quality of the included studies."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This review provides an updated overview of observational and intervention studies investigating the effect of a low-FODMAP (fermentable oligo-, di- and monosaccharides, and polyols) diet (LFD) on gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, quality of life (QoL), nutritional adequacy, and gut microbiome in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. METHODS: We systematically searched available literature until October 2020 for studies that investigated the effect of LFDs on GI symptoms, QoL, nutritional adequacy, and the gut microbiome in IBS patients. The data were represented as standardized mean differences (SMD) for IBS severity, and as mean differences (MD) for IBS-QoL. Meta-analyses were performed for the quantitative analyses using random effects models with inverse variance weighing. RESULTS: Twelve papers (nine parallel trials, three crossover studies) were included for the meta-analysis. The LFD reduced IBS severity by a moderate-to-large extent as compared to a control diet (SMD - 0.66, 95% CI - 0.88, - 0.44, I2 = 54%). When analyzing only studies that used the validated IBS-SSS questionnaire, a mean reduction of 45 points (95% CI - 77, - 14; I2 = 89%) was observed. Subgroup analyses on adherence, age, intervention duration, IBS subtype, outcome measure, and risk of bias revealed no significantly different results. The LFD also increased IBS-QoL scores, when compared with a control diet (MD 4.93; 95% CI 1.77, 8.08; I2 = 42%). CONCLUSIONS: The low-FODMAP diet reduces GI symptoms and improves quality of life in IBS subjects as compared to control diets. Future work is required to obtain definitive answers regarding potential long-term effects of such diets on nutritional adequacy and the gut microbiome.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Identification of microbiota-based biomarkers as predictors of low-FODMAP diet response and design of a diet recommendation strategy for IBS patients. DESIGN: We created a compendium of gut microbiome and disease severity data before and after a low-FODMAP diet treatment from published studies followed by unified data processing, statistical analysis and predictive modeling. We employed data-driven methods that solely rely on the compendium data, as well as hypothesis-driven methods that focus on methane and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolism pathways that were implicated in the disease etiology. RESULTS: The patient's response to a low-FODMAP diet was predictable using their pre-diet fecal samples with F1 accuracy scores of 0.750 and 0.875 achieved through data-driven and hypothesis-driven predictors, respectively. The fecal microbiome of patients with high response had higher abundance of methane and SCFA metabolism pathways compared to patients with no response (p-values < 6 × 10-3). The genera Ruminococcus 1, Ruminococcaceae UCG-002 and Anaerostipes can be used as predictive biomarkers of diet response. Furthermore, the low-FODMAP diet followers were identifiable given their microbiome data (F1-score of 0.656). CONCLUSION: Our integrated data analysis results argue that there are two types of patients, those with high colonic methane and SCFA production, who will respond well on a low-FODMAP diet, and all others, who would benefit a dietary supplementation containing butyrate and propionate, as well as probiotics with SCFA-producing bacteria, such as lactobacillus. This work demonstrates how data integration can lead to novel discoveries and paves the way towards personalized diet recommendations for IBS.",

The aim of the study was to systematically review the literature for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness of the LFD in patients with IBD and FGD. Four databases were searched, but a meta-analysis was not performed due to methodological and outcomes heterogeneity. Four RCTs fulfilled the criteria, with three having some concerns in their risk of bias assessment. All interventions compared the LFDs against a \"typical\" or sham diet, spanning in duration from 21 days to 6 weeks. Quality of life was improved in two RCTs, while revealing inconsistent findings in the third trial, based on different assessment tools. The fecal assays revealed non-significant findings for most variables (fecal weight, pH, water content, gene count, and gut transit time) and inconsistent findings concerning stool frequency and short-chain fatty acids concentration. Levels of fecal calprotectin, CRP, or T-cell phenotype did not differ between intervention and comparator arms. Two RCTs reported a reduction in abdominal pain, while results concerning pain duration and bloating were inconsistent. In one trial, energy intake was considerably reduced among LFD participants. Regarding gut microbiota, no differences were noted. A considerable degree of methodological and outcome heterogeneity was observed, paired with results inconsistency. The available data are not sufficient to justify the claim that an LFD induces relief of FGD symptoms, although it may pave the way to a placebo response.",

We aimed to comprehensively (i) identify diet-microbiota associations in adults with IBS consuming habitual diet; (ii) assess the impact of two nutritional interventions on the microbiota; and (iii) determine whether baseline microbiota can predict clinical response to diet or probiotic intervention. METHODS: Data were analyzed from 95 individuals with IBS participating in a previously published 4-week 2x2 factorial design randomized controlled trial investigating the impact of the low FODMAP diet (LFD) and co-administration of a probiotic. Diet was assessed at four hierarchical levels and partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to profile the microbiota. RESULTS: There were numerous diet-microbiota associations especially at the nutrient level, including a negative association between protein and Bifidobacterium abundance (rs = -0.358, p < 0.001). After correction for multiple testing, the significance for this association (q = 0.237) and all others was lost. Low FODMAP diet led to changes in abundance of major saccharolytic genera compared with sham diet, including higher Bacteroides (LFD 34.1% (15.7%) vs sham 23.3% (15.2%), q = 0.01) and lower Bifidobacterium (0.9% (1.0%) vs 2.1%, (2.5%) q = 0.029). Compared with placebo, probiotic supplementation led to higher Lactobacillus (probiotic 0.08% (0.1%) vs placebo 0.03% (0.2%), q < 0.001), and Streptococcus abundance (2.0% (2.2%) vs 0.6% (1.2%), q = 0.001). The probiotic treatment buffered the impact of the low FODMAP diet on Bifidobacterium. Baseline microbiota did not predict clinical response to either intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Although diet modifies the gut microbiota, bivariate correlation analysis may only provide a limited explanation of the complex diet interactions with individual gut bacteria in IBS. Some diet interventions modify the microbiota in IBS. TRIAL REGISTRY: ISRCTN (http://www.isrctn.com) Registered under ISRCTN registry identifier no.ISRCTN02275221.",

We investigated the effect of a LFD compared to a less restrictive low lactose diet (LLD) in a randomized cross-over trial with IBS patients. METHODS: Twenty-nine IBS patients were randomly assigned to two groups. After a run-in phase of 14 days, patients received 21 days of either a LFD or LLD. This intervention was followed by a washout period of 21 days before crossing over to the alternate diet. Dietician led diet instruction was given continuously. An IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) was filled in at the end of each study period. To enhance study adherence, daily symptoms were assessed using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). RESULTS: IBS patients, irrespective of lactase deficiency, had a significantly reduced IBS-SSS score after both diets (LFD p = 0.002, LLD p = 0.007) without significant difference. On both diets, patients reported that IBS had less impact on their daily life compared to the time before the study (p < 0.01). On daily assessment, IBS patients on LFD reported significantly less abdominal pain (median VAS difference to baseline -0.8 (-2.8 to 2.7, p = 0.03) and less bloating (-0.5 (-4.1 to 3.4, p = 0.02) than patients on the LLD. CONCLUSION: Both diets improved the overall IBS severity significantly and patients' preference of the two diets was similar. LFD but not LLD effectively reduced pain and bloating in patients with IBS.",

      "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder with a worldwide prevalence of 11%. It is characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel habits in the absence of underlying unique pathology. The condition is associated with poor quality of life and high use of healthcare resources required for management. The low FODMAP diet (LFD) is a recognized treatment for symptom management of IBS; however, approximately 30% of patients do not respond. The aim of this review was to understand the effectiveness and application of the LFD compared with other dietary and non-dietary interventions. Ten studies were included, eight of which assessed the LFD against other dietary interventions including traditional dietary advice, modified National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines, a high FODMAP diet, gluten-free diet and Mediterranean diet, generalized dietary advice, probiotics, and a sham diet. Two studies compared a LFD to non-diet interventions of gut directed hypnotherapy or yoga. The findings clearly support the LFD as an effective treatment in IBS, and although it highlights the role for microbiota and current psychosocial state, it remains challenging to identify what combination of treatments may be best to ensure a personalized approach and overall higher response rates to IBS therapy."

There are no studies investigating the effectiveness of the low FODMAP diet in pediatric patients with functional abdominal pain (FAP). OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the low FODMAP diet in reducing gastrointestinal symptoms in children with FAP in comparison to the control diet based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines. METHODS: Twenty-seven children with diagnosed FAP were randomized to 2 groups. Each group received an intervention: the low FODMAP diet or the diet based on NICE. All food was prepared and delivered by a catering company. Data regarding gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded by participants during the 2-week baseline assessment and 4-week dietary intervention. The frequencies of abdominal pain and stools were reported as a number of events per day. The severity of abdominal pain was assessed using the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale. The assessment of stool consistency was based on the Bristol Stool Form Scale. RESULTS: The tendency toward the improvement in abdominal symptoms was noted in the low FODMAP group but without statistical significance. No significant differences in stool consistency were observed in this group. The NICE group experienced significant reduction in abdominal pain intensity and frequency (p < 0.01) and improvement in stool consistency (93% reporting normal stool, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot study suggest that the low FODMAP diet is not effective in the reduction of symptoms in children with FAP.",

A non-blinded intervention study was conducted with adults over 65 years with chronic diarrhea referred for colonoscopy where no cause was found.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) is an effective way to reduce gut symptoms in people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This diet reduces the intake of fermentable fibres, leading to changes of the gut microbiota and insufficient fermentation in the large bowel, resulting in reduced production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate, which has unfavourable implications for gut health, sleep and mental health. This study will examine the effect of Fibre-fix, a supplement containing a mix of dietary fibres, on the human gut microbiome composition, fermentative capacity, sleep, quality of life (QOL) and mental health of people with IBS who consume a low FODMAP diet (LFD). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study design is proposed to examine whether Fibre-fix added to an existing LFD may help modulate gastrointestinal function, improve markers of sleep, mental health and promote QOL in patients with IBS. Participants will provide stool and blood samples, daily bowel symptoms diaries and 3-day diet records. Additionally, they will complete validated questionnaires relating to FODMAP intake, sleep, mental health and QOL before and after a 3-week intervention. Gut health will be assessed via faecal microbiome composition, faecal pH and SCFA levels. Alteration of sleep will be recorded using an actigraphy device worn by all participants over the whole study. Multivariate analysis will be used to examine the gut microbiome and repeated measures Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used for dependent variables from questionnaires related to bowel symptoms, stool type, sleep, mental health and QOL to assess the differences between intervention and control groups after adjustment for confounding variables. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee of Edith Cowan University (2019-00619-YAN). Results will be disseminated in peer-review journal publications, and conference presentations. Participants will be provided with a summary of findings once the study is completed. If Fibre-fix is shown to result in favourable changes in gut microbial composition, SCFA production, sleep and mental well-being without exacerbating symptoms, this will provide additional dietary management options for those with IBS following an LFD.

The LFD was effective in controlling digestive symptoms both in the short- and long-term, and in improving quality of life, anxiety and depression, even if some problems regarding acceptability were reported and adherence decreased in the long term. The LFD improved the food-related quality of life without affecting nutritional adequacy.

Even if some problems of acceptability and adherence are reported, an LFD is nutritionally adequate and effective in improving IBS symptoms also in the long term.",

Secondly, this paper examined the agreement between parental perception of children's symptoms and children's self-assessment of symptoms during the diet in both treatment groups. Twenty-seven children with diagnosed functional abdominal pain (FAP) were randomized to one of two group, receiving the low FODMAP diet or the diet based on NICE guidelines. Children reported gastrointestinal symptoms at baseline and during the diet. At the end of the intervention, parents assessed their children's diet and symptoms changes, using Likert scales. The agreement between parental and children assessments of gastrointestinal symptoms was defined as the percentage of compatible answers. In the low FODMAP group a significantly lower percentage of parents (38%) declared that it was easy to follow the diet, compared to the NICE group (57%), (p = 0.017). A high percentage of parents in both groups reported improvement in all symptoms of children during dietary intervention. A high level of agreement was also observed between parental and children's self-assessment of abdominal pain intensity and frequency. Our research suggests that in parental opinion the low FODMAP diet is as effective as the diet based on NICE guidelines in children with FAP. However, the low FODMAP diet may seem more difficult to follow, and this may have had an impact on the effectiveness and acceptability of the FODMAP diet by children.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Functional bowel disorders (FBD), such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), are increasingly more common in children and affect up to 20% of children. The etiology is multifactorial with no clear organic cause. Symptoms are recurrent and are associated with a reduced quality of life, school absences, and psychological challenges. Treatment options are variable. FODMAPs are short-chained carbohydrates, poorly absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract due to their increased osmotic activity and excess gas production from the bacterial fermentation process. There is a paucity of data examining dietary interventions that restrict carbohydrates in children with IBS. The aim of this study was to examine the use of the low FODMAP diet (LFD) in children with an FBD. METHODS: A retrospective clinical case note review of children with an FBD managed with an LFD was undertaken. Anthropometry and clinical data were collected by a pediatric gastroenterology dietitian. An IBS satisfaction survey was used to assess diet outcomes. Statistical analyses were completed using Excel. RESULTS: Of the 29 children included in this study, complete resolution of gastrointestinal symptoms was observed for 11 of 12 (92%) of those with bloating, 13 of 15 (87%) of those with diarrhea, and 17 of 22 (77%) of those with abdominal pain. Twenty-three (79%) participants reported an improvement of symptoms. Fructans were the most common symptom-causing carbohydrate. CONCLUSION: The LFD is a useful dietary treatment strategy for children with FBD. This study adds to the small body of evidence supporting FODMAP dietary interventions in children with FBD. Further prospective studies are required."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Small inter- and intrafractional prostate motion was shown to be a prerequisite for precise radiotherapy (RT) of prostate cancer (PCa) to achieve good local control and low rectal toxicity. As rectal gas and rectal volume are known to have a relevant effect on prostate motion, this study aims to reduce these parameters by using a Low FODMAP Diet (LFD) and to show feasibility of this intervention. METHODS: We compared a prospective intervention group (IG, n = 25) which underwent RT for PCa and whose patients were asked to follow a LFD during RT with a retrospective control group (CG, n = 25) which did not get any dietary advice. In the planning CT scan and all available cone beam CT scans rectal gas was classified based on a semiquantitative score (scale from 1 to 5) and rectal volume was measured. Furthermore, patients' compliance was evaluated by a self-assessment questionnaire. RESULTS: Clinical and treatment characteristics were well balanced between both groups. A total of 266 (CG, 10.6 per patient) and 280 CT scans (IG, 11.2 per patient), respectively, were analysed. The frequency distribution of gas scores differed significantly from each other (p < .001) with the IG having lower scores. Rectal volume was smaller in the IG (64.28 cm3, 95% CI 60.92-67.65 cm3, SD 28.64 cm3) than in the CG (71.40 cm3, 95% CI 66.47-76.32 cm3, SD 40.80 cm3) (p = .02). Mean intrapatient standard deviation as a measure for the variability of rectal volume was 22 cm3 in the IG and 23 cm3 in the CG (p = .81). Patients' compliance and contentment were satisfying. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a LFD significantly decreased rectal gas and rectal volume. LFD was feasible with an excellent patients' compliance. However, prospective trials with a larger number of patients and a standardized evaluation of gastrointestinal toxicity and quality of life are reasonable.

Given that most IBS patients associate their GI symptoms with eating food, specific dietary manipulation has become an attractive treatment strategy. A diet low in FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) has generated the greatest level of scientific and clinical interest. Overall, 52-86% of patients report significant improvement of their IBS symptoms with elimination of dietary FODMAPs. Patients who experience symptom improvement with FODMAP elimination should undergo a structured reintroduction of foods containing individual FODMAPs to determine sensitivities and allow for personalization of the diet plan.

      "abstract": "Food is often considered to be a precipitating factor of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in FODMAPs (Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Mono-saccharides, And Polyols), which can be found in many common foods. A low FODMAP diet (LFD) is increasingly suggested for IBS treatment. However, long-term, large, randomized controlled studies are still lacking, and certainties and doubts regarding LFDs have grown, often in a disorderly and confused manner. Some potential LFD limitations and concerns have been raised, including nutritional adequacy, cost, and difficulty in teaching the diet and maintaining it. Most of these limitations can be solved with the involvement of a skilled nutritionist, who can clearly explain the different phases of the LFD and ensure nutritional adequacy and compliance. Further studies should focus on new methods of teaching and learning the LFD and on predictors of response. Moreover, particular interest should be focused on the possible use of LFD in gastrointestinal diseases other than functional disorders and, possibly, also in non-gastrointestinal diseases. The aim of the present review was to clarify the effective and appropriate indications and limitations of an LFD and to discuss its possible future uses.",

This study aimed to evaluate the real-world experience of patients recommended the diet. METHODS: This case-series interviewed FGID patients attending a gastroenterology clinic with previous recommendation to trial the low FODMAP diet, examining who recommended the diet and what their percentage improvement was. To evaluate implementation of the diet's 3 phases, questions were constructed based on current literature and clinical guidelines regarding length of initial restriction and food knowledge (Phase-1), number of foods re-challenged (Phase-2) and food re-introduction as tolerated (Phase-3). The comprehensive nutrition assessment questionnaire provided daily FODMAP intake. Data were analyzed using chi-squared tests. KEY RESULTS: In 80 patients (21 male), the diet was recommended by the gastroenterologist in 53%, general practitioner 22%, dietitian 9% and other 15%. 30% saw a dietitian for guidance. 55% reported a ≥50% symptom improvement. The diet was followed appropriately during Phase-1 by 78% (with vs without a dietitian, 96% vs 71%; P = .02), Phase-2 by 48% (70% vs 39%; P = .02) and Phase-3 by 40% (65% vs 29%; P < .01). A FODMAP intake of <12 g/d (considered therapeutic) was achieved by 44% (72% vs 31%; P < .01). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Symptom improvement was reported in half of patients, but many did not reach the therapeutic FODMAP intake target, especially without dietitian education. Compliance was poor in Phase-2 and Phase-3 but improved with dietitian guidance.",

METHODS: An LFD is associated with symptom improvement in patients with functional intestinal disorders, although its safety and efficacy has not been characterized in patients with IBD. Fifty-five patients with IBD in remission or with mild disease activity were randomized to a 6-wk LFD or standard diet (SD). Disease activity (Harvey-Bradshaw index [HBi], partial Mayo score), fecal calprotectin, and disease-specific quality of life (IBD-Q) were assessed at baseline and at the end of dietary intervention. RESULTS: After the 6-wk dietary intervention, median HBi decreased in the LFD (4; IQR, 3-5 versus 3; IQR, 2-3; P = 0.024) but not in the SD (3; IQR, 3-3 versus 3; IQR, 2-4), whereas Mayo scores were numerically decreased in the LFD group and unmodified in the SD group. Median calprotectin decreased in the LFD (76.6 mg/kg; IQR, 50-286.3 versus 50 mg/kg; IQR, 50.6-81; P = 0.004) but not in the SD group (91 mg/kg; IQR, 50.6-143.6 versus 87 mg/kg; IQR, 50-235.6). Lastly, we observed a barely significant increase in median IBD-Q in the LFD group (166; IQR, 139-182 versus 177; IQR, 155-188; P = 0.05) and no modification in the SD group (181; IQR, 153-197 versus 166; IQR, 153-200). CONCLUSIONS: A short-term, LFD is safe for patients with IBD, and is associated with an amelioration of fecal inflammatory markers and quality of life even in patients with mainly quiescent disease.",

Further, some dietary approaches, such as a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs), are restrictive and may contribute to nutritional inadequacy. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate habitual nutrient intake, diet quality, and diversity in IBS and the effect of a 4-week low FODMAP diet on these parameters compared with controls. DESIGN: Data from two randomized controlled trials were included for this secondary analysis. Participants were randomized to low FODMAP diet (n=63) or control diet (sham diet n=48, habitual diet n=19). PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Participants included 130 individuals with IBS referred to a tertiary center in London, UK between January 2010 to June 2011 and January 2013 to November 2014. INTERVENTION: Participants in one trial were randomized to receive either low FODMAP dietary counseling or sham control dietary counseling. In the other, they were randomized to receive low FODMAP dietary counseling or to continue habitual diet. All advice was provided by a specialist dietitian. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Habitual (usual) dietary intake at baseline (n=130) and after a 4-week intervention period was measured using 7-day food records. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Analysis of covariance and χ2 tests evaluated differences across groups at 4 weeks. RESULTS: When examining habitual intake of individuals with IBS, fiber intake was low, with only 6 (5%) achieving the target (30 g/day). In those receiving low FODMAP advice, there was no difference in intake of most nutrients compared with controls. However, there was lower intake of starch (109 g/day) vs habitual control diet (128 g/day; P=0.030), and higher intake of vitamin B-12 (6.1 μg/day) vs habitual (3.9 μg/day) and sham control diets (4.7 μg/day; P<0.01). Overall scores for diet quality were lower after low FODMAP advice vs habitual control diet (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates many individuals with IBS fail to meet dietary reference values for multiple nutrients. A 4-week low FODMAP diet, when delivered by a specialist dietitian, does not impact on intake of most nutrients or diet diversity but decreases diet quality compared with control diets.",

      "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders worldwide. While the pathogenesis is not clearly understood, current research points to the role of the gut microbiome and alterations in the diversity of the microbiota. Probiotics, prebiotics, and low FODMAP diet are therapeutic means associated with modification of the gut microbiome for the alleviation of IBS symptoms. This narrative review assesses the current evidence on the efficacy of these treatment options based on findings from recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses published from October 2013 to October 2018. There is a general agreement in the 11 included systematic reviews and meta-analyses that probiotic therapy is safe and can be effective in improving overall IBS symptom scores and abdominal pain in the general IBS population. Nonetheless, conflicting findings remain and no recommendation on the specific species/strains or combination can be made. Short-term restriction of FODMAP in the diet can improve IBS symptoms as per the findings of 7 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, even though the quality of the evidence remains questionable. Inappropriate use of the low FODMAP diet can potentially impact health negatively. As such, a low FODMAP diet is only recommended as a second line treatment guided by qualified clinicians with specialized training. Despite preclinical studies of some prebiotics demonstrated the potential use in improving gut microbiome and intestinal inflammatory response, the beneficial effect of prebiotics for IBS remains theoretical. Two systematic reviews found no evidence to support the clinical use of prebiotics for IBS.",

      "abstract": "Background: a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) may be effective in the treatment of pediatric patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Its complexity and side effects make it a secondary therapeutic alternative. Objective: to demonstrate that nutritional education, aimed at optimizing the diet of children with IBS, is able to improve gastrointestinal symptoms of children without following a diet low in FODMAP. Methods: prospective intervention study. Changes in gastrointestinal symptoms were analyzed by means of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™ Gastrointestinal Symptoms (PedsQL™ GI Symptoms), after receiving nutritional education based on a healthy diet. Likewise, anthropometric changes and dietary habits were analyzed. Results: twenty-one patients were included (12 girls) with a mean age of 10.6 years (5-14 years). A diet with excess intake of simple sugars, saturated fats and salt along with fiber deficit was observed. After the intervention, an increase in 8.07 points was observed in the inventory (95% CI: 13.42 a -2.73, p = 0.005). Additionally, significant weight loss was observed in overweight and obese patients (decrease in body mass index [BMI]; Z-score 0.62 SD, p = 0.001). Significant changes in dietary habits were observed: increased consumption of complex carbohydrates, fruits and vegetables and reduction of simple sugars. Conclusions: healthy eating is effective to improve gastrointestinal symptoms in pediatric patients with IBS, without requiring the exclusion of FODMAP.",

Long-term low-FODMAP studies rarely report quality of life (QoL). We aimed to determine the effect of low-FODMAP diet on long-term QoL, gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI symptoms in IBS patients. METHODS: A prospective observational study of IBS patients referred for low-FODMAP dietary advice was performed. The primary outcome of QoL and secondary outcomes of GI symptoms, anxiety/depression, fatigue, sleep quality, and happiness were obtained at baseline, 6 weeks (T6), and 6 months (T26). RESULTS: 111 patients were recruited. 91.0%, 71.6%, and 50.5% of participants completed baseline, T6, and T26 assessments, respectively. There were significant improvements in QoL from baseline at T6 and T26 (both P < 0.001). Significant reductions were seen in GI symptoms at T6 and T26 (both P < 0.001), fatigue at T6 and T26 (both P < 0.003), and anxiety at T6 and T26 (both P < 0.007), compared with baseline. A significant reduction was seen for depression (P < 0.010) from baseline at T26, and a significant increase was seen for both happiness and vitality (both P < 0.04) from baseline at T26. There was a significant correlation between GI symptom response and change in QoL, anxiety, depression, and fatigue (all P < 0.034). CONCLUSION: Low-FODMAP diet was associated with improved long-term QoL and GI symptoms, reduced fatigue and anxiety/depression, and increased happiness and vitality. These data support a wider range of benefits for IBS patients consuming a low-FODMAP diet.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The low-FODMAP diet has emerged as an option for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This diet is very restrictive, and compliance is usually low. Preliminary findings suggest an association between eating disorders (EDs) and the risk of developing IBS. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between compliance with a low-FODMAP diet and the risk of ED behaviours among patients with IBS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A single-centre prospective study was carried out among 233 IBS patients (79.8% females) at University College London Hospital, who commenced a low FODMAPs group programme for IBS (Rome III or IV). Self-reported diet adherence at the end of the 6-week programme was measured. At baseline, and at the 6-week follow-up visit, participants completed the validated IBS-Symptom Severity Score, the SCOFF ED screening questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: Adherence with a low-FODMAP diet was found in 95 (41%) patients. Overall, 54 (23%) patients were classified to be at risk for ED behaviour. Adherence was 57% in the ED group (31/54) versus 35% in the non-ED group (64/179); P<0.05. Adherence with a low-FODMAP diet was highest (51%) in the IBS with diarrhoea subtype and lowest (10%) in IBS with constipation. There was no significant correlation between IBS-Symptom Severity Score and either adherence (P=0.39) or ED behaviour (P=0.28). CONCLUSION: In this IBS cohort, greater adherence to a low-FODMAP diet is associated with ED behaviour. The implications of our study are important in clinical practice for a clinician to have a high index of suspicion of EDs in IBS patients when a high level of low-FODMAP diet achieved.",

We aimed to describe our early experience in a single center with a dedicated gastroenterology dietetic service. METHODS: Consecutive patients with IBS referred to our dedicated Dietetic Gastroenterology Clinic between February 2016 and May 2016 were screened. A low FODMAP diet was instituted as per standard protocol. Data on demographic and clinical variables were obtained from patients' records and prospective telephone interviews. RESULTS: A total of 16 patients, with a median age of 67 ± 13.57 years; female gender n = 10 (62.5%); ethnicity: Chinese n = 8 (50%), Indian n = 5 (31.25%), and Malay n = 3 (18.75%) with IBS, were included in the study. Compliance with the low FODMAP diet was complete in 8 of 16 (50%) patients, partial in 4 of 16 (25%), and 4 of 16 (25%) could not comply with the diet at all. Improvement in symptoms were reported in 11 of 16 (68.8%) patients. Among patients who complied (complete/partial) with the low FODMAP diet, predominant symptom improvement was reported as follows: abdominal pain 3 of 5 (60%), abdominal bloating/distension 7 of 10 (70%), and flatulence 7 of 8 (87.5%). Patients with the IBS-D subtype appeared to have the greatest improvement in stool consistency (87.5% IBS-D vs 12.5% non-IBS-D, P = 0.009). CONCLUSION: Based on our pilot observational study of a relatively small sample of Asian IBS patients, compliance with a low FODMAP diet appears to be low. Further larger studies are required to verify our observation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Ingestion of poorly digested, fermentable carbohydrates (fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols; FODMAPs) have been implicated in exacerbating intestinal symptoms and the reduction of intake with symptom alleviation. Restricting FODMAP intake is believed to relieve colonic distension by reducing colonic fermentation but this has not been previously directly assessed. We performed a randomised controlled trial comparing the effect of a low FODMAP diet combined with either maltodextrin or oligofructose on colonic contents, metabolites and microbiota. METHODS: A parallel randomised controlled trial in healthy adults (n = 37). All subjects followed a low FODMAP diet for a week and supplemented their diet with either maltodextrin (MD) or oligofructose (OF) 7g twice daily. Fasted assessments performed pre- and post-diet included MRI to assess colonic volume, breath testing for hydrogen and methane, and stool collection for microbiota analysis. RESULTS: The low FODMAP diet was associated with a reduction in Bifidobacterium and breath hydrogen, which was reversed by oligofructose supplementation. The difference in breath hydrogen between groups post-intervention was 27ppm (95% CI 7 to 50, P<0.01). Colonic volume increased significantly from baseline in both groups (OF increased 110ml (19.6%), 95% CI 30ml to 190ml, P = 0.01; MD increased 90ml (15.5%), 95% CI 6ml to 175ml, P = 0.04) with no significant difference between them. Colonic volumes correlated with total breath hydrogen + methane. A divergence in Clostridiales abundance was observed with increased abundance of Ruminococcaceae in the maltodextrin group, while in the oligofructose group, Lachnospiraceae decreased. Subjects in either group with high methane production also tended to have high microbial diversity, high colonic volume and greater abundance of methanogens. CONCLUSION: A low FODMAP diet reduces total bacterial count and gas production with little effect on colonic volume.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The low FODMAP diet (fermentable oligosaccharides, monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polyols) has shown to be effective in adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome, but there are few studies on paediatric patients. The aim of this study is to assess the implementation and the outcomes of a low FODMAP diet in the treatment of functional abdominal pain in children from a Mediterranean area. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A table was designed in which foods were classified according to their FODMAP content, as well as a 'Symptoms and Stools Diary'. A prospective study was conducted on children with functional abdominal pain in our Paediatric Gastroenterology Unit. RESULTS: A total of 22 patients were enrolled in the trial, and 20 completed it. Data were collected of the abdominal pain features over a period of 3 days, and then patients followed a two-week low FODMAP diet. Afterwards, information about abdominal pain features was collected again. After the diet, they showed fewer daily abdominal pain episodes compared to baseline (1.16 [IQR: 0.41-3.33] versus 2 [IQR: 1.33-6.33] daily episodes, P=.024), less pain severity compared to baseline (1.41cm [IQR: 0.32-5.23] versus 4.63cm [IQR: 2.51-6.39] measured by 10-cm Visual Analogue Scale, P=.035), less interference with daily activities, and less gastrointestinal symptoms. Only 15% of patients found it difficult to follow the diet. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of a low FODMAP diet for 2 weeks in a Mediterranean paediatric population diagnosed with functional abdominal pain is possible with adapted diets. It was highly valued by patients, and they showed an improvement in abdominal pain symptoms assessed by objective methods.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Patients with radiation-induced enteropathy (RE) after cancer treatment show similar symptoms as patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) diet (LFD) is a widespread management strategy for IBS. We aimed to investigate if there may be a positive effect of LFD on symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with RE. METHODS: In an open non-controlled pilot study, 11 patients (all female) with RE-related IBS symptoms were recruited largely based on own initiative. All followed LFD for four weeks. IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) and IBS Symptom Questionnaire (IBS-SQ) were used to assess symptoms. Short Form Nepean Dyspepsia Index (SF-NDI) and 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) evaluated HRQOL. A three day food record was used to estimate baseline intake of FODMAPs and to reveal dietary changes. RESULTS: FODMAP intake was successfully reduced, although LFD was found a burdensome intervention. IBS symptoms improved significantly based on mean total score of IBS-SSS and IBS-SQ, which changed from 310.2 ± 60.7 to 171.4 ± 107.2 (p = .001) and 27.4 ± 4.1 to 15.7 ± 10.1 (p = .002). HRQOL improved based on SF-NDI total score (30.5 ± 9.4 to 18.3 ± 8.2, p = .001) and based on mental (p = .047) and physical (p = .134) score of SF-12. Main additional dietary changes were reduced intake of energy, carbohydrates, and fiber. CONCLUSION: Our findings from this small-scaled pilot study indicate that the LFD may alleviate symptoms and improve HRQOL in patients with RE. Further controlled studies with larger sample size should be conducted to verify our results and hopefully enable implementation of LFD as a future part of the management strategy for RE.",

AIM: To examine the effect of a yoga-based intervention vs a low-FODMAP diet on patients with irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with irritable bowel syndrome undertook a single-blind, randomised controlled trial involving yoga or a low-FODMAP diet for 12 weeks. Patients in the yoga group received two sessions weekly, while patients in the low-FODMAP group received a total of three sessions of nutritional counselling. The primary outcome was a change in gastrointestinal symptoms (IBS-SSS). Secondary outcomes explored changes in quality of life (IBS-QOL), health (SF-36), perceived stress (CPSS, PSQ), body awareness (BAQ), body responsiveness (BRS) and safety of the interventions. Outcomes were examined in weeks 12 and 24 by assessors \"blinded\" to patients' group allocation. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was found between the intervention groups, with regard to IBS-SSS score, at either 12 (Δ = 31.80; 95%CI = -11.90, 75.50; P = .151) or 24 weeks (Δ = 33.41; 95%CI = -4.21, 71.04; P = .081). Within-group comparisons showed statistically significant effects for yoga and low-FODMAP diet at both 12 and 24 weeks (all P < .001). Comparable within-group effects occurred for the other outcomes. One patient in each intervention group experienced serious adverse events (P = 1.00) and another, also in each group, experienced nonserious adverse events (P = 1.00). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome might benefit from yoga and a low-FODMAP diet, as both groups showed a reduction in gastrointestinal symptoms. More research on the underlying mechanisms of both interventions is warranted, as well as exploration of potential benefits from their combined use.",

A random effects model was used to account for different sources of variation among studies. Heterogeneity was assessed using Q statistics, I², Tau, and Tau². Publication bias was analysed and represented by a funnel plot, and funnel plot symmetry was assessed with Egger's test. The results showed that in the RCTs, the patients receiving a low-FODMAP diet experienced a statistically significant pain and bloating reduction compared with those receiving a traditional diet; as regards to stool consistency, there was no significant difference between treatments. A significant reduction in abdominal pain and bloating were described by patients receiving a low-FODMAP diet compared with those receiving a high-FODMAP diet. In cohort studies, pain and bloating were significantly reduced after treatment compared with the baseline diet. We conclude that there is evidence that a low-FODMAP diet could have a favourable impact on IBS symptoms, especially abdominal pain and bloating. However, it remains to be demonstrated whether a low-FODMAP diet is superior to conventional IBS diets, especially in the long term.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The low-FODMAP diet is a frequently used treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Most research has focused on short-term FODMAP restriction; however, guidelines recommend that high-FODMAP foods are reintroduced to individual tolerance. This study aimed to assess the long-term effectiveness of the low-FODMAP diet following FODMAP reintroduction in IBS patients. METHODS: Patients with IBS were prospectively recruited to a questionnaire study following completion of dietitian-led low-FODMAP education. At baseline and following FODMAP restriction (short term) only, gastrointestinal symptoms were measured as part of routine clinical care. Following FODMAP reintroduction, (long term), symptoms, dietary intake, acceptability, food-related quality of life (QOL), and healthcare utilization were assessed. Data were reported for patients who continued long-term FODMAP restriction (adapted FODMAP) and/or returned to a habitual diet (habitual). KEY RESULTS: Of 103 patients, satisfactory relief of symptoms was reported in 12% at baseline, 61% at short-term follow-up, and 57% at long-term follow-up. At long-term follow-up, 84 (82%) patients continued an 'adapted FODMAP' diet (total FODMAP intake mean 20.6, SD 14.9 g/d) compared with 19 (18%) of patients following a 'habitual' diet (29.4, SD 22.9 g/d, P=.039). Nutritional adequacy was not compromised for either group. The 'adapted FODMAP' group reported the diet cost significantly more than the 'habitual' group (P<.001) and affected social eating (P<.01) but there was no effect on food-related QOL. Healthcare utilization was similar between both groups. CONCLUSION AND INFERENCES: Low-FODMAP education is effective for long-term IBS management, enables a nutritionally adequate diet, and is broadly acceptable to patients.",

The aim of this review was to address the applicability of this diet to South Asia. The high prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome in South Asia and its associated effects of quality of life and economics warrant the introduction of efficacious therapies. The considerable heterogeneity of dietary patterns and methods of food preparation across South Asian countries and a paucity of food analysis limit precision in defining foods that are high or low in FODMAPs. Spices and condiments are commonly consumed and mostly have a low FODMAP content. However, major high FODMAP sources are frequently used and include onion, garlic, shallots, legumes/pulses, and wheat-based products, as well as coconut and milk products, offering an opportunity for dietary management to reduce the symptom load. The feasibility of instituting a restrictive diet in which foods with a high FODMAP content are replaced by foods low in FODMAPs must be addressed as a substantial proportion of the nutritional intake including energy, proteins, and micronutrients, is often obtained from FODMAP-rich food. Furthermore, limited knowledge of health professionals together with a paucity of dietitians further challenge the practicality of introducing the diet. Thus, while the use of the low FODMAP diet in South Asia may be more limited than in westernized countries, it does offer potential therapeutic opportunities, the efficacy, and impact of which require further investigation.",

This information must be disseminated for application to clinical practice. RECENT FINDINGS: There are many people with IBS worldwide who can benefit from following the low FODMAP diet to alleviate or minimize symptoms. Clinical studies and trials demonstrating the positive outcomes of the low FODMAP diet have been based on diet education provided by dietitians. Understanding the types of carbohydrates that are high in FODMAPs and the associated symptoms, nutrition intervention can be targeted using the low FODMAP diet. The nutrition intervention is relatively in expensive, noninvasive and basically without side-effects if monitored by a dietitian and clinical team. SUMMARY: Applying the low FODMAP diet in IBS can greatly improve health and quality of life outcomes by alleviating or significantly improves symptoms.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: To assess the current evidence regarding the benefit of a low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyol (FODMAP) diet in the treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: Databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, Medline were comprehensively searched for relevant studies through January 2017. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to analyze the dichotomous variables (diarrhea response, abdominal pain and bloating, etc.) and the continuous variables. Random- and fixed-effects models were chosen according to heterogeneity. RESULTS: Two RCTs and four before-after studies with a total of 319 patients (96% in remission) were identified. Except for the constipation response, there was a significant improvement in other symptoms: diarrhea response (OR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.11-0.52, p = 0.0003), satisfaction with gut symptoms (OR: 26.84, 95% CI: 4.6-156.54, p < 0.00001), abdominal bloating (OR: 0.10, 95% CI: 0.06-0.16, p < 0.00001), abdominal pain (OR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.16-0.35, p < 0.00001), fatigue (OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.24-0.66, p = 0.0003) and nausea (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.31-0.85, p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analysis offers proof to support that a low FODMAP diet is beneficial for reducing gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with quiescent IBD. With the inherent limitations, the findings of this analysis remain to be confirmed and updated by further high-volume, well-designed and long-term follow-up studies.",

AIM: To provide a systematic review of the quality of trials on the symptomatic effects of the low FODMAP diet for IBS. METHODS: Pubmed and EMBASE were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting effect of the low FODMAP diet on IBS symptoms. The quality of trials was evaluated by estimating risk of bias and assessing trial methodology. RESULTS: Nine RCTs were eligible, including 542 patients. The intervention period was from 2 days to 6 weeks and one trial included a 6-month follow-up. Three trials intervened by providing meals, controlling with a diet high in FODMAP content. In six trials, the intervention was instruction by a dietician and a variety of control interventions were used, all with limited established efficacy. Domains with a high risk of bias were identified for all the trials. High risk of bias dominated domains regarding blinding, with only one trial double-blinded. CONCLUSIONS: The RCTs on the low FODMAP diet are characterized by high risk of bias. The diet has not been studied in a randomised, controlled setting for more than 6 weeks and trials examining the effect of the important reintroduction period are lacking. There is a risk that the symptomatic effects reported in the trials are driven primarily by a placebo response.",

      "abstract": "The low-fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet is a 2-phased intervention, with strict reduction of all slowly absorbed or indigestible short-chain carbohydrates (ie, FODMAPs) followed by reintroduction of specific FODMAPs according to tolerance. The efficacy of the elimination phase of the FODMAP diet is well established, but the success of maintaining this diet has been shown in only a few observational studies. How the efficacy of the low-FODMAP diet compares with that of other therapies has received limited attention, but recent studies have shown this diet to be comparable or superior to diets that address eating style and choice of food as well as to gut hypnotherapy. There has been no comparison between the low-FODMAP diet and the gluten-free diet, which moderately reduces FODMAP intake. Mechanistically, dietary FODMAPs have very limited effects on the consistency of bowel actions but seem to suppress the release of histamine. Neither symptom pattern nor breath hydrogen testing for fructose or polyol malabsorption is a useful predictor of efficacy, but analysis of gut microbiota has potential. As a restrictive diet, the low-FODMAP diet carries risks of nutritional inadequacy and of fostering disordered eating, which has received little attention. Strict FODMAP restriction induces a potentially unfavorable gut microbiota, although the impact of this consequence upon health is unknown. This observation puts additional impetus on the reintroduction of FODMAPs according to tolerance during the maintenance phase of the diet. Studies of the low-FODMAP diet in children are few but do suggest benefit. However, such a strategy should be implemented with care due to the psychological and nutritional risks of a restrictive diet. Clinical wisdom is required in utilizing the low-FODMAP diet."

Visceral hypersensitivity is a key feature in both conditions. AIMS: To determine if there are distinct symptom patterns in women with IBS and endometriosis, and to determine the response of these women to a low FODMAP diet in comparison to those with IBS alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from women attending a specialist IBS service in Christchurch New Zealand. Data from those who met Rome III criteria for IBS were sorted into two groups: concurrent endometriosis and those with IBS alone. Demographics and symptom patterns were identified from a prospective questionnaire. A low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) diet was taught to all women as the primary therapeutic intervention. Responses to the diet were noted against their ultimate disposition. RESULTS: Of the 160 women who met Rome III criteria for IBS, 36% had concurrent endometriosis. The presence of dyspareunia (P > 0.0001), referred pain (P = 0.005), bowel symptoms exacerbated by menstruation (P = 0.0004) and a family history of endometriosis (P = 0.0003) were associated with concurrent endometriosis. Seventy two percent of these women reported a >50% improvement in bowel symptoms after four weeks of a low FODMAP diet compared with 49% in those with no known endometriosis (P = 0.001, odds ratio 3.11, 95% CI, 1.5-6.2). CONCLUSIONS: Women with concurrent endometriosis and IBS report a unique symptom phenotype. The low FODMAP diet appears effective in women with gut symptoms and endometriosis.",

      "abstract": "FODMAP, \"Fermentable Oligo-, Di- and Mono-saccharides And Polyols\", is a heterogeneous group of highly fermentable but poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates and polyols. Dietary FODMAPs might exacerbate intestinal symptoms by increasing small intestinal water volume, colonic gas production, and intestinal motility. In recent years the low-FODMAP diet for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has gained increasing popularity. In the present review we aim to summarize the physiological, clinical, and nutritional issues, suggesting caution in the prolonged use of this dietary treatment on the basis of the existing literature. The criteria for inclusion in the FODMAPs list are not fully defined. Although the low-FODMAP diet can have a positive impact on the symptoms of IBS, particularly bloating and diarrhea, the quality of the evidence is lower than optimal, due to frequent methodological flaws, particularly lack of a proper control group and/or lack of blinding. In particular, it remains to be proven whether this regimen is superior to conventional IBS diets. The drastic reduction of FODMAP intake has physiological consequences, e.g., on the intestinal microbiome and colonocyte metabolism, which are still poorly understood. A low-FODMAP diet imposes an important restriction of dietary choices due to the elimination of some staple foods, such as wheat derivatives, lactose-containing dairy products, many vegetables and pulses, and several types of fruits. For this reason, patients may be at risk of reduced intake of fiber, calcium, iron, zinc, folate, B and D vitamins, and natural antioxidants. The nutritional risk of the low-FODMAP diet may be higher in persons with limited access to the expensive, alternative dietary items included in the low-FODMAP diet.",

It was hypothesized that restricting the intake of all short-chain carbohydrates that are either slowly absorbed or not digested in the small intestine should be considered together because they all have similar effects on the intestine by distending the lumen. These groups of carbohydrates were called, Fermentable, Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides and Monosaccharides and Polyols (FODMAPs), because of the lack of a known collective term. By reducing their dietary intake, it was also hypothesized that abdominal symptoms in patients with IBS would be alleviated in patients with visceral sensitivity and a low FODMAP diet was subsequently designed. Over the last 12 years, the mechanisms of action, food content of FODMAPs and efficacy of the diet, among other aspects have been intensively studied. In many parts of the world, the low FODMAP diet is now considered a front-line therapy for IBS.",

      "abstract": "A diet low in poorly absorbed, fermentable, short chain carbohydrates (FODMAPs) is an effective strategy to manage symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The diet has gained traction since its original description in Australia 10 years ago and is now an internationally accepted dietary management strategy for IBS. Randomized controlled trials have raised the profile of the low-FODMAP diet to become a viable first-line therapy for IBS, when implemented under a dietitian's guidance. Importantly, the diagnosis of IBS should be confirmed before commencement of the dietary approach. The skill set of the dietitian is then paramount to the success of the diet. Experience in gastrointestinal disorder management, consideration of symptom types, severity, baseline FODMAP intake, and overall nutritional content and meal pattern are vital in the assessment of the patient. If a strict low-FODMAP diet is deemed necessary, it should only be for an initial period of 4 to 6 weeks. Research suggests that a strict long-term, low-FODMAP diet may negatively impact intestinal microbiome. After the initial strict period, follow up with the dietitian should be conducted to achieve the overall goal-a relaxed FODMAP restriction that enables inclusion of prebiotic FODMAPs while still maintaining symptom relief. The diet will be effective in the vast majority of patients. For those in which it fails, FODMAPs should be reintroduced to the diet, and other dietary (or non-dietary) approaches should be considered.",

      "abstract": "Six randomized controlled trials comparing low FODMAP diet with placebo approaches have all indicated efficacy in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The studies have provided all the food (n = 3) or utilized dietitian-led education (n = 3). They have variably met criticisms regarding issues such as the choice of placebo, the number of patients studied, the success of blinding, and the duration of the interventions, but the results are uniformly positive for the diet. Real-world experience of the low FODMAP diet has confirmed the findings of the randomized studies, in that about 70% of patients respond. Difficulty in delivering the diet has not been an issue, and the majority of patients find the diet easy to follow when dietitian led. Observational studies have suggested durability of efficacy, even in association with reintroduction of FODMAPs as recommended. Three studies comparing institution of standard dietary guidelines for IBS with the low FODMAP diet have found either similar or improved outcomes with the latter. Low FODMAP diet also has similar efficacy to that of gut-directed hypnotherapy, another strategy with broad benefit in IBS. There are currently no clinically applicable indices that predict response to the diet. In conclusion, clinical trials and observational studies support the notion that a dietitian-led low FODMAP diet is ready for primetime and should be considered as a first-line therapy for patients with IBS where the use of a restrictive diet is appropriate.",

      "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is heterogeneous. Patients need proper assessment and explanation of IBS pathophysiology and appropriate therapies. A low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) diet effectively reduces symptoms in 75% of patients. Best treatment for those nonresponsive will depend on the pathophysiological basis for symptom genesis, with the following possible abnormalities: (i) Visceral hypersensitivity and/or enhanced gut-brain communication: a low FODMAP diet is mainly targeted for this patient group. A dietitian may also recommend antispasmodic agents, including peppermint oil. Another dietary treatment is a low food chemical diet, although this diet is often extremely limited, and therefore, not suited for some populations. Psychological therapies are also clinically beneficial. (ii) Altered motility: in patients with fast transit, a dietitian may recommend a reduction in all FODMAPs or targeted monosaccharides and disaccharides, which are more osmotic in nature. If not effective, patients may benefit from psyllium, which has an exceptional water-holding capacity aimed to promote more formed stools. Patients with slow or uncoordinated transit are often more difficult to treat. Dietary interventions have some success and usually comprise a combination of adequate fiber and fluid, osmotic laxatives, and stimulating agents such as caffeine, senna, and exercise. (iii) Altered microbiome: supplementary probiotics and prebiotics have weak evidence of efficacy with some notable exceptions. A dietitian may trial supplementary Bifidobacterium infantis or oligosaccharides, usually as an adjunct therapy. Guidance from a dietitian will encompass dietary methods to treat IBS but additionally identify where dietary treatment is not indicated to ensure that diet is correctly used and patients are not nutritionally or psychologically compromised.",

      "abstract": "The low fermentable, oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) diet has good evidence for use in the treatment of patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Importantly, patients are encouraged not to remain on a strict low FODMAP diet long-term, and many patients maintain symptom improvement with a relaxed, moderate FODMAP restriction. The re-challenge phase is crucial to assist patients in identifying specific dietary triggers, reduce the level of dietary restriction required, and increase prebiotic intake. Limited evidence is available to guide best practice, but, in practice, beneficial outcomes can be seen through strategic food reintroductions. Here, we set out some practical recommendations based on clinical experience. Dietitians should tailor the challenge process to the individual patient and their needs. Food challenges should aim to improve dietary variety and nutritional adequacy while considering specific food preferences and usual dietary habits. Identifying FODMAP subgroups that are well tolerated is helpful, allowing the reintroduction of some moderate to high FODMAP foods back into the diet without symptom induction. FODMAP subtypes that are less well tolerated may also be reintroduced, but dosage and frequency of consumption need to be individualized. Additional challenges that face dietitians include consideration of patients with multiple dietary restrictions such as in vegetarians or patients with diabetes who are simultaneously following a low FODMAP diet. Ensuring nutritional adequacy is essential. The outcome of the re-challenge process aims to find a balance between good symptom control and expansion of the diet.",

Specifically, a diet low in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs) has demonstrated efficacy in approximately 70% of patients. As evidence in support of the low FODMAP diet continues to emerge, there is increasing debate regarding implementation of the diet particularly concerning who should educate patients and how to educate them. Registered dieticians have largely pioneered the evidence that supports the effectiveness of the low FODMAP diet in irritable bowel syndrome, and the diet is recognized as a dietician-led therapy. However, there is an increasing trend for non-dietician-led implementation of the diet despite an absence of evidence on both the clinical or cost-effectiveness of such. Additionally, there is a growing requirement for dietetic services to increase capacity in response to increasing referrals, and consequently, there is a need to investigate innovative ways to educate patients whilst maintaining dietician-led intervention. Herein, we review the evidence for delivery of the low FODMAP diet and discuss potentially effective methods for service delivery.",

The ongoing uncertainty of the cause(s) of diverticulitis confounds attempts to determine the validity of this therapy. However, the features of a high-fiber diet represent a logical contradiction for colon diverticulitis. Considering that Bernoulli's principle, by which enlarged diameter of the lumen leads to increased pressure and decreased fluid velocity, might contribute to development of the diverticulum. Thus, theoretically, prevention of high pressure in the colon would be important and adoption of a low FODMAP diet (consisting of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) may help prevent recurrence of diverticulitis."

This case-study outlines one of these GI-targeted approaches via the implementation of a short-term low FODMAP (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides and Polyols) diet, with the aim to attenuate persistent running specific GI symptoms in a recreationally competitive multisport athlete (male, 86 kg, 57.9 ml·kg·min-1 V02max, 10-15 hr/week training, with no diagnosed GI disorder). Using a single-blinded approach a habitual diet was compared with a 6-day low FODMAP intervention diet (81 ± 5g vs 7.2 ± 5.7g FODMAP s/day) for their effect on GI symptoms and perceptual wellbeing. Training was similar during the habitual and dietary intervention periods. Postexercise (During) GI symptom ratings were recorded immediately following training. Daily GI symptoms and the Daily Analysis of Life Demands for Athletes (DALDA) were recorded at the end of each day. Daily and During GI symptom scores (scale 0-9) ranged from 0-4 during the habitual dietary period while during the low FODMAP dietary period all scores were 0 (no symptoms at all). DALDA scores for worse than normal ranged from 3-10 vs 0-8 in the habitual and low FODMAP dietary periods, respectively, indicating improvement. This intervention was effective for this GI symptom prone athlete; however, randomized-controlled trials are required to assess the suitability of low FODMAP diets for reducing GI distress in other symptomatic athletes.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: There has been an increasing interest in the role of fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We report results from the first randomized controlled trial of the low FODMAP diet in US adults with IBS and diarrhea (IBS-D). The objectives were to compare the efficacy of the low FODMAP diet vs. a diet based upon modified National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines (mNICE) on overall and individual symptoms in IBS-D patients. METHODS: This was a single-center, randomized-controlled trial of adult patients with IBS-D (Rome III) which compared 2 diet interventions. After a 2-week screening period, eligible patients were randomized to a low FODMAP or mNICE diet for 4 weeks. The primary end point was the proportion of patients reporting adequate relief of IBS-D symptoms ≥50% of intervention weeks 3-4. Secondary outcomes included a composite end point which required response in both abdominal pain (≥30% reduction in mean daily pain score compared with baseline) and stool consistency (decrease in mean daily Bristol Stool Form of ≥1 compared with baseline), abdominal pain and stool consistency responders, and other key individual IBS symptoms assessed using daily questionnaires. RESULTS: After screening, 92 subjects (65 women, median age 42.6 years) were randomized. Eighty-four patients completed the study (45 low FODMAP, 39 mNICE). Baseline demographics, symptom severity, and nutrient intake were similar between groups. Fifty-two percent of the low FODMAP vs. 41% of the mNICE group reported adequate relief of their IBS-D symptoms (P=0.31). Though there was no significant difference in the proportion of composite end point responders (P=0.13), the low FODMAP diet resulted in a higher proportion of abdominal pain responders compared with the mNICE group (51% vs. 23%, P=0.008). Compared with baseline scores, the low FODMAP diet led to greater reductions in average daily scores of abdominal pain, bloating, consistency, frequency, and urgency than the mNICE diet. CONCLUSIONS: In this US trial, 40-50% of patients reported adequate relief of their IBS-D symptoms with the low FODMAP diet or a diet based on modified NICE guidelines. The low FODMAP diet led to significantly greater improvement in individual IBS symptoms, particularly pain and bloating, compared with the mNICE diet.",
