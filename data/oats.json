      "abstract": "Naked oats offer substantial nutritional and health benefits, primarily due to their main dietary fiber component, soluble β-(1,3)(1,4)-D-glucan (β-glucan). In a pool experiment, humic acid (HA) was applied once during both the booting and anthesis stages at varying irrigation amounts (60 mm, 120 mm, and 180 mm) to assess changes in β-glucan content in grains post-anthesis. Results indicated that at 5 days post-anthesis (DPA), the β-glucan content (3.14% W/W) in grains increased by 16%with the application of HA, compared to the control treatment of spraying an equal volume of water (p < 0.01). The β-glucan content (4.13%, 4.51%) at 15 and 25 DPA reflects increases of 9% and 5% compared to the control. Overall, the application of HA enhanced the β-glucan content in grains, with levels gradually increasing at 5, 15, and 25 DPA; however, the amplitude of the increase gradually declined over time. The β-glucan content in grains at 5 and 15 DPA, along with glucose content in panicles at 20 DPA, directly influenced the β-glucan content in grains at 25 DPA. At 10 DPA, the distribution of sucrose in the leaves and panicles influences the soluble sugar content, subsequently regulating the β-glucan content in the grains at 15 DPA. Specifically, the sucrose content in the leaves exerts a positive regulatory effect, whereas in the panicles exerts a negative regulatory effect."

      "abstract": "This study investigates the antibacterial and cancer-preventive properties of β-glucan nanoparticles (GNP) synthesised from oats using microwave energy, sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP), and silver (Ag). UV-visible spectroscopy indicated a strong surface plasmon resonance peak between 220 and 250 nm for GNP. FTIR analysis identified a band at 609 cm-1, signifying β linkage and confirming the presence of β-glucans. SEM imaging showed that the nanoparticles have smooth surfaces with various forms and sizes ranging from 67 to 129 nm, which aligns with the average size of 76-115 nm determined by particle size analysis. The disc diffusion method revealed significant antibacterial activity of GNP and DNA fragmentation confirmed that GNP induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cell lines. The observed IC50 value (50.41-59.34 µg/ml) indicated the dose at which GNP effectively triggers apoptosis highlighting their potent anticancer effects. The selective cytotoxicity towards cancer cells emphasises the need for further exploration of these nanoparticles for targeted cancer therapy."

Optimum adsorbent dose of nano-starch was 0.75 g/25 mL and that of acetylated nano-starch was 1.00 g/25 mL. Structural and morphological analyses were carried-out using FTIR, XRD, and SEM-EDS. Nano-starch exhibited higher thermal stability with a Final Decomposition Temperature (FDT) of 620 °C. Adsorption data followed the Langmuir isotherm with adsorption capacity = 1.48 μg/g for 60 ppb initial concentration of U(VI) and pseudo-second-order kinetics (R2 = 0.99). The reusability of both biosorbents is excellent, with nano-starch retaining ~80 % efficiency and acetylated nano-starch ~84 % over five cycles, presenting an effective solution for U(VI) removal from wastewater.",

      "abstract": "The chemical composition of raw oat grain is responsible for the high dietary value and health-promoting properties of oat products. This article presents the results of a study investigating the biofortification of grain in two oat genotypes-hulless and hulled-through agronomic treatments: chemical plant protection against weeds and fungi and mineral nitrogen fertilization. The applied agronomic treatments induced different changes in the fatty acid profiles, content of tocopherols, macronutrients, and micronutrients in the grain of hulled and hulless oats. Plant health contributed to higher concentrations of unsaturated fatty acids and potassium in oat grain. In turn, nitrogen fertilization decreased the content of unsaturated fatty acids, potassium, and copper and increased the content of saturated fatty acids, calcium, and manganese in oat grain. At the same time, agronomic treatments reduced the tocopherol content of the grain, which implies that the nutritional value of oats increases in the absence of chemical plant protection agents. The correlations between the content of desirable chemical compounds and agronomic treatments were stronger in hulless oat grain, which may suggest that the agronomic modification of oat-based foods is more effective in this genotype. The content of exogenous alpha-linoleic acid C18:3 n-3 and alpha-tocopherol was higher in grain harvested from the control treatment (without chemical plant protection), whereas grain harvested from fully protected treatments accumulated more essential gamma-linolenic acid C18:3 n-6. The content of gamma-tocopherol and copper in oat grain was higher in the absence of nitrogen fertilization."

The main determining indicators are the type of crop and exposure duration. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of Al and of UV-C light on the germination and initial growth of white oats. Seeds were sown on germitest paper in a solution of 100, 200, 300, 400, or 500 mg/L of aluminum chloride and kept in a germination chamber at 20°C for a 12-hr photoperiod. Germination and seedling growth parameters were determined after 5 and 10 days. The seeds were also exposed to two doses of UV-C (0.85 and 3.42 kJ m-2) under aluminum chloride stress (200 mg/L). Data demonstrated that treatment with aluminum chloride significantly decrease in germination at 200 mg/L and total seedling length at 100 mg/L. Exposure of seeds to UV-C light under excess Al (200 mg/L) did not show a significant effect on germination and growth compared to control (non-irradiated). Results indicated that exposure to high concentration of Al in the medium adversely altered germination and initial growth of white oat seedlings. Although UV-C light alone was not detrimental to the germination process, treatment with UV-C light also failed to mitigate the toxic effects of Al.",

The purpose of this review was to critically evaluate the state of the science of oats in relation to all-cause mortality, cardiovascular and diabetes risk and the effects of oats on blood lipids, blood glucose, blood pressure, weight management and gut health from meta-analyses and systematic reviews. Limited epidemiological data indicated a possible beneficial effect of oats on all-cause mortality and incident diabetes when high versus low oat consumers were compared, but its effect on cardiovascular events was not adequately discerned. Observational data also showed an inverse association between oat intake and blood cholesterol, blood pressure, body weight and obesity variables in different populations. Randomized controlled oat intervention studies demonstrated a significant reduction in postprandial blood glucose in both diabetic and non-diabetic subjects, fasting blood glucose in diabetic subjects, blood pressure in prehypertensive individuals, and body weight and adiposity in overweight individuals. Increased fecal bulk was observed but clinical data for a potential gut barrier effect is lacking. The mechanism of action of each health effect was reviewed. While beta-glucan viscosity was once considered the only mode of action, it is evident that the fermentation products of beta-glucan and the associated gut microbial changes, as well as other components in oats (i.e., avenanthramides etc.) also play an important role.",

The study measured key aspects such as moisture content, dynamic rheological properties, water state, protein secondary structure, color, and sensory assessment. The influence of these factors on the product's quality is analyzed. The findings revealed that the freeze-thaw treatment caused a reduction in water content, freezable water, and deeply bound water, as well as an increase in weakly bound water, β-sheet, random coil, and α-helix, and a decreased β-turn of the potato-oat composite dough. Additionally, the dough treated by freeze-thaw cycles resulted in darker color, and the sensory properties of the product were affected significantly after exceeding three freeze-thaw cycles. Moreover, an increase in the number of freeze-thaw cycles resulted in an upward trend of moisture content for the composite dough, whereas G' initially increased and then decreased. The G″ of the composite dough peaked after the third freeze-thaw cycle. Overall, the composite dough quality significantly deteriorated at the fourth freeze-thaw cycle. There was a significant increase in the freezable water content, the largest modulus of elasticity, and the smallest tan δ. Therefore, the usage of the potato-oat composite dough should not exceed three cycles."

However, the ratios of the concentrations of free trichothecenes and their conjugates and how they are impacted by different interacting environmental conditions are not well documented. This study aims to examine the effect of water activity (0.95 and 0.98 aw) and temperature (20 and 25 °C) stress on the production of T-2 and HT-2 toxins, deoxynivalenol and their conjugates, as well as diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS). Multiple mycotoxins were detected using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry from 64 contaminated oat samples. The highest concentrations of HT-2-glucoside (HT-2-Glc) were observed at 0.98 aw and 20 °C, and were higher than other type A trichothecenes in the natural oats' treatments. However, no statistical differences were found between the mean concentrations of HT-2-Glc and HT-2 toxins in all storage conditions analysed. DAS concentrations were generally low and highest at 0.95 aw and 20 °C, while deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside levels were highest at 0.98 aw and 20 °C in the naturally contaminated oats. Emerging mycotoxins such as beauvericin, moniliformin, and enniatins mostly increased with a rise in water activity and temperature in the naturally contaminated oats treatment. This study reinforces the importance of storage aw and temperature conditions in the high risk of free and modified toxin contamination of small cereal grains.",

Twelve lactating Nordic Red cows, of which 4 were primiparous, and averaging (±SD) 48 ± 22.9 DIM, 37.8 ± 7.14 kg/d milk yield were enrolled in a switch-back design experiment with 3 periods of 4 wk each. The cows were assigned into 6 pairs based on parity, DIM, milk yield, and BW at the beginning of the experiment. The experimental treatments were (1) rapeseed cake and oats (RSC+O), and (2) rapeseed meal and barley (RSM+B) as the concentrate feeds. Cows in each pair were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 groups, which received the treatments in 2 different sequences (i.e., group 1 received RSC+O in period 1 and 3, and RSM+B in period 2, whereas group 2 was fed RSM+B in period 1 and 3, and RSC+O in period 2). The diets consisted of a partially mixed ration with grass silage mixed with either oats or barley, according to the treatment sequence, and the rapeseed cake or meal being mixed into a pellet with either oats or barley according to the treatments, and a mineral mix. The pellet was delivered at a fixed amount (i.e., 6 kg/d for multiparous and 5 kg/d for the primiparous cows) from the milking robot. The actual forage to concentrate ratios for RSC+O and RSM+B were 51:49 and 52:48, respectively, with NDF concentrations of 41.5% and 36.0% and CP concentrations of 17.0% and 16.7% of diet DM. Dry matter intake, milk yield, and gas exchange (with a GreenFeed system attached to the milking robot) were recorded daily, and milk composition and spot fecal samples were collected during the last week of each period. Based on feed analysis, and DMI of the cows during the experiment, the total fat content of the experimental diets was 4.1% and 2.7% of DM for RSC+O and RSM+B diets, respectively. Dry matter intake was 1.6 kg/d lower, and milk yield tended to be 1.0 kg/d greater for RSC+O versus RSM+B. There were no differences in ECM yield and milk composition between the treatments, whereas milk ME efficiency was greater for cows fed RSC+O than RSM+B. Methane yield (g/kg DMI) did not differ between treatments, but CH4 production (g/d) was 9.4% and CH4 intensity as g/kg ECM was 11.7% lower for RSC+O versus RSM+B. The lower CH4 production was likely caused by the lower DMI and fiber digestibility, observed with the RSC+O diet. In addition, the greater lipid intake also contributed to lower rate of fermentation and subsequent decrease in CH4 production. Overall, feeding rapeseed cake with oats in a grass silage-based diet increased feed efficiency while decreasing CH4 emission intensity in lactating cows. This provides a practical way of mitigating ruminal CH4 emission from dairy operations while maintaining milk production with commonly used feedstuffs in Nordic conditions.",

This paper presents a study on the use of a mixture of cover crops of self-grown oats (Avena sativa L.) and sown white mustard (Sinapis alba L.) in organic farming under the agroecological conditions of Serbia. The main objective was to identify sensitive carbon pools (microbial carbon and nitrogen, basal respiration and a number of specific groups of soil microorganisms) in organic farming with and without cover crops. The inclusion of a mixture of white mustard and self-grown oats as a cover crop led to a significantly increased biogenity of the soil compared to a control after only a few years of investigation. The number of microorganisms, soil respiration and microbial biomass carbon were significantly higher in the cover crop treatment compared to the control soil on an organic farm in Serbia. This is the first study in Serbia to investigate the effect of self-grown oats as a cover crop. Further research will incorporate a wider range of variables and factors in order to develop a sustainable and effective site-specific system for organic crop production in Serbia."

The objective of this study was to elucidate the symptomatic and asymptomatic host range of P. sansomeana on six agricultural crop species commonly used in field crop rotations in Michigan. In addition, sensitivity to oomicides commonly used in seed treatments, including oxathiapiprolin, mefenoxam, ethaboxam, and pyraclostrobin, was performed to aid in disease management recommendations. Plant biomass, quantity of P. sansomeana DNA in roots, and reisolations were used to assess pathogenicity and virulence of 18 isolates of P. sansomeana on each plant species using an inoculated seedling growth chamber assay. Isolates displayed varying levels of virulence to the hosts tested. Reisolations were completed for each plant species tested, and varying quantities of P. sansomeana DNA were found within all plant species root samples. Corn, wheat, soybean, dry bean, and winter cereal rye plants were symptomatic hosts with significant reduction observed in the total plant biomass. No significant reduction in total plant biomass was observed in oats, and oat roots harbored the least amount of P. sansomeana DNA. No P. sansomeana isolates were insensitive to the oomicide compounds tested with mean absolute inhibition (EC50) values of fungicide required for 50% growth inhibition values of 7.8 × 10-2 μg/ml for mefenoxam, 1.13 × 10-1 μg/ml for ethaboxam, 2.6 × 10-2 μg/ml for oxathiapiprolin, and 3.04 × 10-1 μg/ml for pyraclostrobin. These results suggest that common crop rotations in Michigan may not be a viable option to reduce soilborne inoculum accumulation and oomicide seed treatments could be considered for early-season management of P. sansomeana.",

PEF treatment (99 monopolar, rectangular pulses lasting 10 µs each, with a frequency of 13 Hz and a nominal electric field strength of 2250 V/cm) was applied at two growth stages: (i) when the seedlings had 0.2 cm roots emerging from the kernel, and (ii) when they had a 0.4 cm shoot emerging from the kernel. Post-treatment, the seedlings were hydroponically grown for 8 days. To induce stress, the hydroponic medium was augmented with PEG (15 %) to induce drought stress and NaCl (150 mM) to induce salinity stress. Results demonstrate that applying PEF improved the growth of the root and shoot of oat seedlings. This effect was more pronounced when applied to more developed seedlings. When PEF was applied during the later stage of germination, seedlings exposed to salinity stress showed enhanced shoot growth compared to the control. Under the studied conditions, the application of PEF had no impact on the growth of seedlings under drought stress.",

      "abstract": "Background: In recent years, oats' effect on lowering serum cholesterol has been recognized. However, no systematic reviews summarized the effect of daily consumption of oat-based products on serum lipids in patients with dyslipidemia. Methods: We searched eight databases and two clinical trial registries from inception to July 31, 2023. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of oat-based products (≥4 weeks) on lipid levels or cardiovascular events in patients with dyslipidemia. Two authors independently screened articles, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies with Cochrane risk-of-bias tool 2.0. We used STATA 17.0 to conduct meta-analysis and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess the certainty of evidence. Results: We finally included 17 eligible trials with 1731 subjects. The oat intervention varied from oat β-glucan-based products to oat bran-based products and wholegrain oat. Overall, the risk of bias of included trials was high or some concerns were noted because of the inadequate randomization, allocation concealment, and inappropriate data analysis method. Compared to the placebo or usual diet, one study indicated that oat-based products have no significant difference in major cardiovascular events. Pooled estimates showed that oat-based products may result in a large reduction in LDL-C (WMD, -0.24 mmol L-1; 95% CI: -0.33, -0.15) (moderate certainty) and TC (WMD, -0.32 mmol L-1; 95% CI: -0.48, -0.17) (moderate certainty). Compared to other diets (mainly other cereals), oat-based products probably reduce the level of LDL-C (WMD, -0.17 mmol L-1; 95% CI: -0.25, -0.08) (moderate certainty) and TC (WMD, -0.21 mmol L-1; 95% CI: -0.30, -0.12) (moderate certainty). Both groups showed that oat-based products had little effect on HDL-C and TG (moderate certainty). Oat-related adverse events were mostly gastrointestinal such as diarrhea, nausea, and flatulence being the most prevalent. Conclusions: Oat-based products may reduce TC and LDL-C, but have little effect on TG, HDL-C, and major cardiovascular events in patients with dyslipidemia.",

      "abstract": "Avenanthramides (Avns) and their derivatives, a group of polyphenolic compounds found abundantly in oats (Avena sativa Linn.), have emerged as promising candidates for neuroprotection due to their immense antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties. Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), characterized by the progressive degeneration of neurons, present a significant global health burden with limited therapeutic options. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in cell survival, growth, and metabolism, making it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. The dysregulation of PI3K signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various NDDs including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Avns have been shown to modulate PI3K/AKT signaling, leading to increased neuronal survival, reduced oxidative stress, and improved cognitive function. This review explores the potential of Avn polyphenols as modulators of the PI3K signaling pathway, focusing on their beneficial effects against NDDs. Further, we outline the need for clinical exploration to elucidate the specific mechanisms of Avn action on the PI3K/AKT pathway and its potential interactions with other signaling cascades involved in neurodegeneration. Based on the available literature, using relevant keywords from Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science, our review emphasizes the potential of using Avns as a therapeutic strategy for NDDs and warrants further investigation and clinical exploration.",

      "abstract": "Antibiotic-induced gut microbiome dysbiosis (AID) is known to be influenced by host dietary composition. However, how and when diet modulates gut dysbiosis remains poorly characterized. Thus, here, we utilize a multi-omics approach to characterize how a diet supplemented with oats, a rich source of microbiota-accessible carbohydrates, or dextrose impacts amoxicillin-induced changes to gut microbiome structure and transcriptional activity. We demonstrate that oat administration during amoxicillin challenge provides greater protection from AID than the always oats or recovery oats diet groups. In particular, the group in which oats were provided at the time of antibiotic exposure induced the greatest protection against AID while the other oat diets saw greater effects after amoxicillin challenge. The oat diets likewise reduced amoxicillin-driven elimination of Firmicutes compared to the dextrose diet. Functionally, gut communities fed dextrose were carbohydrate starved and favored respiratory metabolism and consequent metabolic stress management while oat-fed communities shifted their transcriptomic profile and emphasized antibiotic stress management. The metabolic trends were exemplified when assessing transcriptional activity of the following two common gut commensal bacteria: Akkermansia muciniphila and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. These findings demonstrate that while host diet is important in shaping how antibiotics effect the gut microbiome composition and function, diet timing may play an even greater role in dietary intervention-based therapeutics. IMPORTANCE We utilize a multi-omics approach to demonstrate that diets supplemented with oats, a rich source of microbiota-accessible carbohydrates, are able to confer protection against antibiotic-induced dysbiosis (AID). Our findings affirm that not only is host diet important in shaping antibiotics effects on gut microbiome composition and function but also that the timing of these diets may play an even greater role in managing AID. This work provides a nuanced perspective on dietary intervention against AID and may be informative on preventing AID during routine antibiotic treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dietary components that impact the gut microbiota may beneficially affect cardiometabolic health, possibly by altered bile acid metabolism. However, impacts of these foods on postprandial bile acids, gut microbiota, and cardiometabolic risk markers are unclear. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the chronic effects of probiotics, oats, and apples on postprandial bile acids, gut microbiota, and cardiometabolic health biomarkers. METHODS: Using an acute within chronic parallel design, 61 volunteers (mean ± SD: age 52 ± 12 y; BMI 24.8 ± 3.4 kg/m2) were randomly assigned to consume 40 g cornflakes (control), 40 g oats or 2 Renetta Canada apples each with 2 placebo capsules per day or 40 g cornflakes with 2 Lactobacillus reuteri capsules (>5 × 109 CFU) per day, for 8 wk. Fasting and postprandial serum/plasma bile acids and cardiometabolic health biomarkers, fecal bile acids, and gut microbiota composition were determined. RESULTS: At week 0, oats and apples significantly decreased postprandial serum insulin [area under the curve (AUC): 25.6 (17.4, 33.8) and 23.4 (15.4, 31.4) vs. 42.0 (33.7, 50.2) pmol/L × min and incremental AUC (iAUC): 17.8 (11.6, 24.0) and 13.7 (7.7, 19.8) vs. 29.6 (23.3, 35.8) pmol/L × min] and C-peptide responses [AUC: 599 (514, 684) and 550 (467, 632) vs. 750 (665, 835) ng/mL × min], whereas non-esterified fatty acids were increased [AUC 135 (117, 153) vs. 86.3 (67.9, 105) and iAUC 96.2 (78.8, 114) vs. 60 (42.1, 77.9) mmol/L × min] after the apples vs. control (P ≤ 0.05). Postprandial unconjugated [AUC: predicted means (95% CI) 1469 (1101, 1837) vs. 363 (-28, 754) μmol/L × min and iAUC: 923 (682, 1165) vs. 22.0 (-235, 279) μmol/L × min)] and hydrophobic [iAUC: 1210 (911, 1510) vs. 487 (168, 806) μmol/L × min] bile acid responses were increased after 8 wk probiotic intervention vs. control (P ≤ 0.049). None of the interventions modulated the gut microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: These results support beneficial effects of apples and oats on postprandial glycemia and the ability of the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri to modulate postprandial plasma bile acid profiles compared with control (cornflakes), with no relationship evident between circulating bile acids and cardiometabolic health biomarkers.",

However, the effect of the mixture of oat hay and alfalfa hay on the meat quality of Albas goats is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of feeding different proportions of oat hay and alfalfa hay on the growth performance and meat quality of Albas goats. Therefore, 32 goats were fed for 70 days and randomly divided into four treatment groups on the principle of similar weight: whole oat group (OAT), oat alfalfa ratio 3:7 group (OA73), oat alfalfa ratio 7:3 group (OA37) and whole alfalfa group (Alfalfa), with eight goats in each group. Daily feed intake records, feces, feed samples, and rumen fluid collection were made throughout the trial. The goats were weighed on the last day of the trial, and four goats per group were randomly selected for slaughter. Cecum contents, meat samples, and hot carcass weight were collected, and data were recorded. Furthermore, the relationship between the rumen and cecal microbes on performance and meat quality was clarified by analyzing the rumen and hindgut microbiomes. The results showed that feeding alfalfa could significantly reduce the daily weight gain of fattening goats. Compared with the highest group (OA37), the daily weight gain decreased by 19.21%. Although there was no significant change in feed intake in the four treatments, the feed conversion rate of the alfalfa group significantly decreased by 30.24-36.47% compared to the other groups. However, with the increased alfalfa content, MDA decreased significantly, T-AOC was up-regulated, and the antioxidant activity of the fattened goat meat fed with the high alfalfa group was significantly higher than that of the low alfalfa group. Notably, the abundance of Bacteroidales_unclassified and Clostridium were strongly correlated with T-AOC and MDA. Therefore, increasing the proportion of alfalfa in the diet can affect the antioxidant activity of goat meat by improving the gut microbiota, while an oat-hay mixture can improve the growth performance of livestock."

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of Avena sativa (oat extracts) on cognitive function among healthy adults. METHODS: A structured literature search was undertaken using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus from the database's establishment until March 17, 2022. Data on cognitive function, regarding accuracy and speed of performance, were gathered from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the acute or chronic effects of Avena sativa in healthy subjects. The Cochrane Collaboration risk-of-bias tool was used to assess the quality of included studies. RESULTS: We included six RCTs, of which three were crossover designs, with a total of 287 individuals. Four studies investigated the acute effect of Avena sativa, while two investigated its chronic effect. Acute ingestion of Avena sativa appeared to positively influence the accuracy and speed of performance. While short-term chronic supplementation resulted in a significant improvement in cognitive function, long-term chronic supplementation did not. Overall, the evidence was of average quality. CONCLUSION: Acute supplementation with Avena sativa may improve cognitive function in healthy volunteers. Given the small number of trials included and the disparity of the intervention dose, the conclusions of this study should be interpreted with caution. More high-quality, long-term studies are warranted.",

      "abstract": "Despite being largely preventable, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is still the leading cause of death globally. Recent studies suggest that the immune system, particularly a form of systemic chronic inflammation (SCI), is involved in the mechanisms leading to CVD; thus, targeting SCI may help prevent or delay the onset of CVD. In a recent placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, an oat product providing 3 g of β-Glucan improved cholesterol low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and lowered cardiovascular risk in adults with borderline high cholesterol. Here, we conducted a secondary measurement of the serum samples to test whether the oat product has the potential to reduce SCI and improve other clinical outcomes related to healthy aging. We investigated the effects of the oat product on a novel metric for SCI called Inflammatory Age® (iAge®), derived from the Stanford 1000 Immunomes Project. The iAge® predicts multimorbidity, frailty, immune decline, premature cardiovascular aging, and all-cause mortality on a personalized level. A beneficial effect of the oat product was observed in subjects with elevated levels of iAge® at baseline (>49.6 iAge® years) as early as two weeks post-treatment. The rice control group did not show any significant change in iAge®. Interestingly, the effects of the oat product on iAge® were largely driven by a decrease in the Eotaxin-1 protein, an aging-related chemokine, independent of a person’s gender, body mass index, or chronological age. Thus, we describe a novel anti-SCI role for oats that could have a major impact on functional, preventative, and personalized medicine.",

A logo or catchphrase indicating the gluten-free condition in a product is all the consumer relies on to accept the product as suitable for his/her treatment. The oat-based gluten-free products represents a small market, which may have changed, and become more limited during COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To assess gluten contamination in all labeled oat-based gluten-free local and imported products available in the market, comparing them to matched regular gluten containing counterparts. As a secondary objective, unconventional flours available in the same sale points were also assessed. RESULTS: The search yielded 25 gluten-free labeled oat flours, rolled, and instant cereals, which were compared to 27 regular gluten containing equivalents. Gluten content was above the local (5 ppm) and the Codex Alimentarius cutoff (20 ppm) in 40 and 36% of the gluten-free labeled products, respectively. When all positive products were analyzed together, there were no differences in gluten content between labeled and unlabeled products. Locally produced products were more expensive, while rolled/instant oats were less contaminated than flours (p = 0.01). Precautionary labels advising presence of gluten as allergen was omitted in 37.0% of regular products. Only 33.3% of unconventional flours obtained from open markets and sold in bulk, were gluten contaminated. CONCLUSION: Oat-based gluten-free products are currently highly contaminated. It is urgent to regulate them and implement protocols that allow safe consumption of these products."

The objective of this study was to prepare biochar from invasive weeds, i.e., Parthenium hysterophorus L. and Lantana camara L., and use it as a soil amendment along with inorganic fertilizers for oats (Avena sativa L.) growth, fodder yield, quality, and soil microbial activities in a two-year pot experiment. Treatments were comprised of control, 100% RDF (Recommended dose of fertilizers), 75% RDF along with three doses (2.5, 5.0, and 10 t/ha) of Parthenium hysterophorus L. biochar (PB) and Lantana camara L. biochar (LB), PB (10 t/ha), and LB (10 t/ha). Results showed that application of 75% RDF along with 10 t/ha LB gave significantly higher green (∼8%) and dry (∼7.8%) fodder yield and crude protein (∼6%) and decreased acid detergent fibre (ADF) and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) by 5.70 and 6.04% as compared to the 100% RDF treatment. The same treatment had a significantly higher population of bacteria (7.33 × 108 colony forming unit (CFU)/g soil), alkaline phosphatase activity (19.56 μg pNP/g soil/h), microbial biomass carbon (156.67 μg/g soil) and dehydrogenase activity (12.59 μg TPF/g/24 h), whereas the maximum fungal population (13.33 × 104 CFU/g soil) and acid phosphatase activity (14.45 μg pNP/g soil/h) were found in 75% RDF along with 10 t/ha PB and control treatment, respectively. This study concluded that application of invasive weed biochar along with inorganic fertilizers can benefit fodder yield and quality of oats by increasing plant height and number of tillers directly and by improving nutrient availability and water holding capacity (WHC) of soil indirectly, besides improving soil health. The findings from this study will provide a potential strategy for invasive weed management.",

      "abstract": "Simulated cattle manure deposition was used to estimate nutrient transfer to soil and oats and to investigate changes in microbial community composition and functional groups in oat rhizospheres. Nutrient absorption and return efficiency were calculated as a series of standard calculation formulas, and total nutrient transfer efficiency was nutrient absorption efficiency plus nutrient return efficiency. In total, 74.83% of nitrogen (N) and 59.30% of phosphorus (P) in cattle manure were transferred to soil and oats, with 11.79% of N and 7.89% of P in cattle manure absorbed by oats, and the remainder sequestered in the soil for 80 days after sowing. Cattle manure increased oat root length, surface, and volume under 0.2 mm diameter, and improved relative abundance of the microbiome known to be beneficial. In response to cattle manure, several bacteria known to be beneficial, such as Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota, and Firmicutes at phyla the level and Pseudoxanthomonas, Pseudomonas, and Sphingomonas at the genus level, were positively related to oat biomass and nutrient accumulation. For fungal communities, the relative abundance of Ascomycota is the predominant phylum, which varied in a larger range in the control treatment (81.0-63.3%) than the cattle manure deposition treatment (37.0-42.9%) as plant growing days extend. The relevant abundance of Basidiomycota known as decomposer was higher in cattle manure deposition treatment compared to that in control treatment at 15 days after sowing. More importantly, cattle manure deposition inhibited trophic mode within pathotroph like Alternaria and Fusarium fungal genus and promoted saprotroph and symbiotroph."

In this study, the optimum extraction conditions and structural identification of AVAs from oats was studied. The inhibitory effect of AVAs from oats on advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) in a glucose-casein simulation system was evaluated, and this revealed dose-dependent inhibitory effects. The trapping capacity of AVAs to the α-dicarbonyl compounds of AGE intermediate products was determined by HPLC-MS/MS, and the results indicate that AVA 2c, AVA 2p, and AVA 2f exhibited the ability to capture α-dicarbonyl compounds. More importantly, AVA 2f was found to be more efficient than AVA 2p at inhibiting superoxide anion radical (O2-), hydroxyl radical (OH), and singlet oxygen (1O2) radical generation, which may be the main reason that AVA 2f was more efficient than AVA 2p in AGE inhibition. Thus, this research presents a promising application of AVAs from oats in inhibiting the food-borne AGEs formed in food processing."

We aim to determine whether non-fatal overdose followed the same pattern as fatal overdose, comparing the first 4 weeks of treatment and treatment cessation and the remainder time off treatment, with the remainder treatment time, to determine intervention markers. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of people with a history of opioid agonist treatment using linked New South Wales data. The incidence of non-fatal overdose hospitalization; emergency department presentation; and fatal overdose from national death records were compared. Rates were calculated using generalized estimating equations adjusting for demographics, year, and recent health and incarceration events. RESULTS: The remainder time in OAT had the lowest incidence of overdose for all outcomes and is the reference level for the adjusted incident rate ratios (aIRR). Fatal overdose was lowest in treatment and highest in the first four weeks out of treatment, aIRR of 12.83 (95% CI 10.0-16.4). Whereas the highest overdose rate for non-fatal opioid overdose was in the first four weeks in treatment, aIRR of 3.11 (95% CI 2.19-4.42). CONCLUSIONS: Retention on opioid agonist treatment is protective against drug related overdose. There is elevated risk of non-fatal overdose at treatment initiation that is not evident for fatal overdose, but the first month of treatment cessation is a critical period for both non-fatal and fatal overdose. These findings emphasize the importance of treatment retention and interventions for polysubstance overdose at cessation.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Dyslipidaemia is a critical factor in the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Concerning dyslipidaemia regulation, we advocate for lifestyle interventions such as diet to complement drug treatment. Numerous studies have confirmed that oat β-glucan, a critical component of oats, can help lower cholesterol. However, there is no conclusive evidence for the efficacy of oats and their products in the treatment of dyslipidaemia. As a result, we have developed this protocol to serve as a guide for future research on oat intervention for dyslipidaemias. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a search of eight databases or websites (PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CNKI, SinoMed, VIP and Wanfang) to identify studies on oats' ability to regulate blood lipid levels. Two authors will screen articles independently, extract data based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, and assess the quality and bias of included studies. To assess and quantify heterogeneity, Q and I2 statistics will be used. If there is significant heterogeneity between studies, the source of the heterogeneity will be investigated using subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis. We will analyse potential publication bias using the Begg funnel plot and Egger's weighted regression statistics. To assess the quality of evidence for the primary outcomes, the Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation method will be used. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study is based on the existing literature and data in the databases. It is not subject to ethical review. The findings, on the other hand, will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. These findings may aid in the management of dyslipidaemia on a daily basis.

Therefore, the present study aimed to uncover the possible mechanism and therapeutic effect of Avenanthramide C in lessening inflammatory responses in pediatric pneumonia. Pediatric pneumonia was induced by liposaccharide (LPS) for vivo model and vitro model. Macrophage was performed to determine the mechanism and effects of Avenanthramide C in pediatric pneumonia. NLRP3 activity participated in the effects of Avenanthramide C in pediatric pneumonia. Avenanthramide C induced p-PI3K and p-Akt expressions and reduced ubiquitination of PI3K expression in pediatric pneumonia. On the other hand, Avenanthramide C integrated serine at 821 sites of the PI3K protein function. Avenanthramide C reduced ROS (reactive oxygen species)-induced mitochondrial damage by PI3K/AKT function in a model of pediatric pneumonia. Avenanthramide C protects pyroptosis in a model of pediatric pneumonia by PI3K/AKT/Nrf2/ROS signaling. Taken together, our results demonstrated that Avenanthramide C protects pyroptosis through dependent ROS-induced mitochondrial damage by PI3K ubiquitination and phosphorylation in a model of pediatric pneumonia, suggesting its potential use for the treatment of pediatric pneumonia and other inflammatory diseases.",

      "abstract": "Sixteen Nordic Red dairy cows, at 80 ± 4.6 d in milk and with an average body weight of 624 ± 91.8 kg, were used in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design to investigate the effects of different concentrate supplements on milk production, enteric CH4 emissions, ruminal fermentation, digestibility, and energy utilization. The cows were blocked into 4 groups based on parity and milk yield and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 experimental concentrates: (1) barley, (2) hulled oats, (3) an oat mixture consisting of hulled and dehulled oats, 50:50 on dry matter basis, and (4) dehulled oats; canola meal was a protein supplement in all 4 concentrates. The cows were fed grass silage and experimental concentrate (forage-to-concentrate ratio 60:40 on dry matter basis) ad libitum. To compare the effects of barley and oats, the barley diet was compared with the overall mean of the hulled oat, oat mixture, and dehulled oat diets. To investigate the effects of gradual replacement of hulled oats with dehulled oats, linear and quadratic contrasts were specified. Milk and energy-corrected milk (ECM) yield were higher on the oat diets compared with the barley diet but were not affected by the type of oats. Concentrations of milk constituents were not affected by grain species or type of oats, except for protein concentration, which was lower on the oat diets than on the barley diet. Feeding the oat diets led to higher milk protein yield and higher milk urea N concentrations. Feed efficiency tended to be higher on the oat diets, and linearly increased with increased inclusion of dehulled oats. Methane emissions (g/d) and CH4 yield (g/kg of dry matter intake) were unaffected by grain species but increased linearly with increasing inclusion of dehulled oats in the diet. Because of higher ECM yield, CH4 intensity (g/kg of ECM) was on average 5.7% lower from cows on the oat diets than on the barley diet. Ruminal fermentation was not affected by dietary treatment. Total-tract apparent digestibility of organic matter, crude protein, and neutral detergent fiber was unaffected by grain species but linearly increased with increasing inclusion of dehulled oats. Gross energy content was higher on the oat diets and linearly increased with increasing inclusion of dehulled oats. Feeding the oat diets led to a lower ratio of CH4 energy to gross energy intake, greater milk energy and heat production but no change in energy balance. Gradual replacement of hulled oats with dehulled oats linearly increased gross energy digestibility, CH4 energy, metabolizable energy intake, heat production, and energy balance. We observed no effect of dietary treatment on efficiency of metabolizable energy use for lactation. In conclusion, replacing barley with any type of oats increased milk and ECM yield, which led to a 5.7% decrease in CH4 intensity. In addition, dehulling of oats before feeding is unnecessary because it did not significantly improve production performance of dairy cows in positive energy balance.",

      "abstract": "Background: Oat and its compounds have been found to have anti-inflammatory effects. Through this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to determine an evidence-based link between oat consumption and inflammatory markers. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. By the end of April 2021, we included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of oat and oat-related products through screening PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrial.gov, and CENTRAL. Meta-analysis was conducted with a random-effect model on the standardized mean difference (SMD) of the change scores of inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-8 (IL-8). Subgroup analyses were conducted to stratify confounding variables. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was applied to report the quality of evidence. This study was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; CRD42021245844). Results: Systematic screening of five databases yielded 4,119 studies, of which 23 RCTs were finally selected. For the four systemic inflammatory markers analyzed, no significant alterations were found after oat consumption. However, oat intake was found to significantly decrease CRP levels in subjects with one or more health complications (SMD: -0.18; 95% CI: -0.36, 0.00; P = 0.05; I 2 = 10%). Furthermore, IL-6 levels were significantly decreased in subjects with dyslipidemia (SMD = -0.34; 95% CI: -0.59, -0.10; P = 0.006; I 2 = 0%). These beneficial effects might be attributed to the effects of avenanthramide and β-glucan. Conclusions: Overall evidence supporting the alleviation of inflammatory response by oat intake was poor, calling for future studies including a larger sample size to confirm the findings."

A total of 211,485,930 clean reads composing 31.30 Gb of clean data were retained for four samples. After assembly, 186,035 unigenes with an average length of 727 bp were generated, and the N50 length was 1,149 bp. Compared with that in the control group, the expression of 7,226 unigenes in the treatment group was upregulated, and 2,618 unigenes were downregulated. Based on the sulfur assimilation pathway and selenocompound metabolic pathway, a total of 27 unigenes related to selenate metabolism were identified. Among them, the expression of both key genes APS (ATP sulfurylase) and APR (adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate reductase) was upregulated more than 1,000-fold under selenate treatment, while that of CBL (cystathionine-β-synthase) was upregulated 3.12-fold. Based on the transcriptome analysis, we suspect that the high-affinity sulfur transporter Sultr1;2 plays a key role in selenate uptake in oats. A preliminary regulatory mechanism explains the oat response to selenate treatment was ultimately proposed based on the transcriptome analysis and previous research."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of irrigation levels on the agronomic performance of white oat (Avena sativa L.) and accuracy of the CERES-Barley model in simulating white oat growth and yield, as well as performing long-term simulation to identify the best sowing time for each irrigation management. The experiment consisted of five irrigation levels (11%, 31%, 60%, 87%, and 100%), being conducted in two agricultural years in southeastern Brazil. The model was calibrated with data of the treatment without water deficit (100%) of the first year and validated with the data of the other treatments in the 2 years. Long-term analyses, with a historical series of 16 years, were performed to recommend the best sowing dates for each irrigation management. Deficit irrigation linearly reduces the agronomic performance of white oat. The high accuracy of white oat yield estimation (R2 = 0.86; RMSE = 616 kg ha-1) using the CERES-Barley model allowed the long-term simulation for establishing the best sowing date for each irrigation level. For higher irrigation levels, sowing in periods with lower temperature (May and June) is more appropriate, as the 1 °C increment in the average temperature before flowering reduces crop yield by 600 kg ha-1. At irrigation levels with higher deficit, sowing in periods with higher rainfall (March and April) promotes higher crop yield.",

Here, the treatment of germinating oats with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) or abscisic acid (ABA) resulted in 2.5-fold (582.9 mg/kg FW) and 2.8-fold (642.9 mg/kg FW) increase in avenanthramide content, respectively, relative to untreated controls (232.6 mg/kg FW). Moreover, MeJA and ABA co-treatment synergistically increased avenanthramide production in germinating oats to 1505 mg/kg FW. Individual or combined MeJA and ABA treatment increased the expression of genes encoding key catalytic enzymes in the avenanthramide-biosynthesis pathway, including hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:hydrocyanthranilate N-hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HHT). Further analyses showed that six AsHHT genes were effectively upregulated by MeJA or ABA treatment, especially AsHHT4 for MeJA and AsHHT5 for ABA, thereby enhancing the production of all three avenanthramides in germinating oats. Specifically, AsHHT5 exhibited the highest expression following MeJA and ABA co-treatment, indicating that AsHHT5 played a more crucial role in avenanthramide biosynthesis in response to MeJA and ABA co-treatment of germinating oats. These findings suggest that elicitor-mediated metabolite farming using MeJA and ABA could be a valuable method for avenanthramide production in germinating oats.",

      "abstract": "Following an application from Nestlé S.A. submitted for authorisation of a health claim pursuant to Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 via the Competent Authority of Belgium, the EFSA Panel on Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens (NDA) was asked to deliver an opinion on the scientific substantiation of a health claim related to beta-glucans from oats and/or barley in a ready-to-eat cereal manufactured via pressure cooking and reduction of blood glucose rise after consumption. The scope of the application was proposed to fall under a health claim based on newly developed scientific evidence. The food proposed is 'beta-glucans from oats and/or barley incorporated into ready-to-eat breakfast cereals manufactured via pressure cooking'. The applicant proposed that at least 1.3 g of beta-glucans/25 g of available carbohydrates in ready-to-eat breakfast cereals manufactured via pressure cooking should be consumed. Beta-glucans from oats, barley or any combination thereof incorporated into ready-to-eat cereals manufactured by pressure cooking, are sufficiently characterised. The claimed effect proposed is 'reduction of the blood glucose rise after the meal'. The reduction of post-prandial glycaemic responses (as long as post-prandial insulinaemic responses are not disproportionally increased) may be a beneficial physiological effect. One human intervention study showed an effect of beta-glucans from oats and/or barley, incorporated into breakfast cereals manufactured via pressure cooking at a level of at least 1.2 g/25 g available carbohydrates, on decreasing post-prandial glycaemic responses without disproportionally increasing insulinaemic responses. Dose-response relationships were not tested, and no evidence has been provided that beta-glucans incorporated into cereals processed using pressure cooking would exert a higher effect on post-prandial glucose responses than beta-glucans added to other carbohydrate containing foods. Whereas the effect of beta-glucans in reducing post-prandial blood glucose responses is well established, the evidence provided is insufficient to establish such an effect at doses of 1.3 g beta-glucans per 25 g of available carbohydrate incorporated into ready-to-eat breakfast cereals manufactured via pressure cooking (i.e. either batch cooking or extrusion)."

      "abstract": "This study evaluated the effects of gradual replacement of barley with oats on enteric CH4 emissions, rumen fermentation, diet digestibility, milk production, and energy utilization in dairy cows fed a grass silage-based diet. Sixteen lactating Nordic Red dairy cows received a total mixed ration [58:42 forage:concentrate on dry matter (DM) basis]. Grass silage (Phleum pratense) was the sole forage with canola meal (10% of diet DM) as a protein supplement. The effects of gradual replacement of barley with oats on DM basis were evaluated using a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with 21 d periods. The grain supplements (30% of diet DM) consisted of 100% barley, 67% barley and 33% oats, 33% barley and 67% oats, and 100% oats. In addition to intake, milk production, and digestibility measurements, CH4 emissions were measured by the GreenFeed system (C-Lock Inc.). The energy metabolism was estimated from the gas exchange measurements recorded by the GreenFeed unit. The last 10 d of each period were used for recordings of gas exchanges, feed intake and milk production. Dry matter intake, body weight, milk yield, and energy-corrected milk yield were not affected by gradual replacement of barley with oats in the diet. Increased inclusion of oats linearly decreased CH4 emissions from 467 to 445 g/d, and CH4 intensity from 14.7 to 14.0 g/kg energy-corrected milk. In addition, the ratio of CH4 to CO2 decreased with increasing inclusion of oats in the diet. Digestibility of organic matter, neutral detergent fiber, and potentially digestible neutral detergent fiber decreased linearly with increasing inclusion of oats. Increased inclusion of oats linearly increased fecal energy from 121 to 133 MJ/d, whereas urinary energy and heat production were not affected by dietary treatment. This resulted in a linear decrease in metabolizable energy intake. However, increased levels of oat in the diet did not significantly affect energy balance or efficiency of metabolizable energy utilization for lactation. This study concludes that barley could be replaced with oats in the diet of dairy cows fed a grass silage-based diet to mitigate CH4 emissions without having any adverse effects on productivity or energy balance. However, the effect of replacing barley with oats on CH4 emissions is dependent on the differences between barley and oats in the concentrations of indigestible neutral detergent fiber and fat.",

Original treatment assignment did not impact current functioning. Overall, participants' mood severity, executive functioning, and global functioning continued to be better than at RCT baseline. Depressive symptoms increased significantly from end of RCT. Manic symptom severity, executive functioning, and global functioning remained comparable to end of RCT. The majority of parents and youth reported improved youth emotion regulation skills and family communication. They considered study participation beneficial, with increased understanding of mood disorders being the top reason. Half of youth commenced or continued Ω3 and 58% commenced or continued psychotherapy post-RCT, suggesting some degree of consumer satisfaction; these youth had lower depression severity than other participants. LIMITATIONS: Only 40% returned to this naturalistic follow-up; they were less likely to have an African-American parent, were of higher income, and youth were more symptomatic at end of RCT than those who did not return CONCLUSIONS: Improvement from RCT baseline continued although depressive symptom severity increased from end of RCT to follow-up. Meaningful improvements in youth and family functioning persisted 2-5 years later. Interventions that prevent relapse or conversion to BPSD are still needed for these vulnerable populations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To examine, among a cohort of opioid dependent people with a history of opioid agonist treatment (OAT), the frequency and incidence rates of non-fatal overdose (NFOD) hospital separations over time, by age and sex. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of people with a history of OAT using state-wide linked New South Wales (NSW) data. The incidence of NFOD hospital separations involving an opioid, sedative, stimulant or alcohol was defined according to the singular or combination of poisoning/toxic effect using ICD-10-AM codes. Crude incidence rates were calculated by gender, age group and calendar year. RESULTS: There were 31.8 (31.3-32.3) NFOD per 1,000 person-years (PY). Opioid NFOD incidence was higher in women than men: incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.11 per 1,000PY; 95 %CI: [1.06-1.17]; women had higher sedative NFOD rates than men, IRR 1.27 per 1,000PY [1.21-1.34]. Participants ≤25 years, 26-30yrs, and 31-35yrs had higher incidence of opioid NFOD compared to 46+yrs, with IRRs of: 1.45 per 1,000PY; [1.32-1.59]; 1.20 per 1,000PY; [1.11-1.30] and 1.22 per 1,000PY; [1.13-1.32], respectively. Between 2006-7 and 2016-17, the cohort accounted for 19 % of NSW opioid NFOD episodes, 12 % of sedative, 14 % of stimulant and 5 % of acute alcohol-related NFOD. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital stays due to NFOD are a relatively frequent occurrence among opioid-dependent people. There are clear differences in rates and substances involved by sex, age and over time. Evidence-based interventions that prevent overdose among people who are opioid dependent need to be delivered to scale, including widespread community provision of naloxone.",

Sixty rats were randomly allocated into six groups, including the control group, HF group, and four oat-intervention groups. Rats in the control group and HF group were respectively given the standard diet and HF diet respectively. The four oat-intervention groups were fed with a special HF diet, in which sucrose and starch in the HF diet were replaced by whole grain oats powder in different proportions of 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% respectively. After 8-week feeding, serum samples of all rats were collected for biochemical detection, and the metabolomics analysis was carried out by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS). The results showed that the WGO could regulate body weight, blood glucose, blood lipid, and inflammatory response, which indicated that WGO could prevent IR induced by the HF diet, and it was effective enough by 50% WGO replacement. By serum metabolomics analysis, six differential metabolites closely related to WGO intervention on IR were found, and the related metabolic pathways involved energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and lipid metabolism.",

Baseline data were gathered from patient records and follow-up data from questionnaires or interviews, and validated questionnaires were used to assess quality of life. We found that altogether 256 patients (82%) were consuming oats as part of their GFD at the follow-up. Long-term follow-up data showed that there were no differences in the presence of long-term illnesses, coeliac disease complications or the usage of medication between those consuming and not consuming oats. However, oat consumers had a better quality of life and reported ongoing gastrointestinal symptoms less frequently (4% vs 19%, p = 0.004) at the follow-up than those not consuming oats.

There are reports of cases from different parts of the world and they involve mainly processed foods based on wheat flour contaminated with mites of several families of the Astigmatina cohort. However, it remains as a little known and difficult to diagnose syndrome. The objective of this study was to describe the first clinical case of OMA due to the consumption of oat flakes in Panama City, Panama. CLINICAL CASE: Female patient of 39-years-old was entered an emergency room with allergic cutaneous and respiratory symptoms one hour after ingesting granola and oatmeal with milk at breakfast. After antiallergic treatment, the cause of allergy was determined by applying skin prick tests for ingested food and house mites. Results indicated a negative reaction for food and positive for mites. The mite analysis of the food samples directed in the identification of the species Blattisocius keegani and Suidasia pontifica, with a high density of the latter in flaked oats.

The objective of this experiment was to determine the effect of physical form of oats in calf starter on the expression of key hepatic gluconeogenic, β-oxidation, and acute phase protein genes in preweaned dairy calves. Samples were analyzed from 3 experiments that fed either ground or whole oats in calf starters. Briefly, 7 calves were slaughtered at 5 wk of age in experiment 1, 6 were slaughtered at 6 wk in experiment 2, and 7 were slaughtered at 7 wk in experiment 3, and liver tissue was collected for gene expression analysis. Calves from experiments 1 and 2 were cannulated, and their rumen pH and volatile fatty acids were measured during treatment periods. The mRNA expression of gluconeogenic enzymes pyruvate carboxylase (PC), cytosolic and mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1 and PCK2), fatty acid oxidation enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1), and positive acute phase protein haptoglobin (HPT) was measured by real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR. Expression of HPT was greater in calves fed whole oats than in calves fed ground oats; however, PC, PCK1, PCK2, and CPT1 were not affected by the physical form of oats. All enzymes (PCK1, PCK2, HPT, and CPT1) except PC were affected by experiment; PCK1 and CPT1 had greater expression in experiment 2 than in experiments 1 and 3. Expression of PCK2 was similar in experiments 2 and 3 but greater than experiment 1. Expression of HPT was similar in experiments 1 and 2 but greater than experiment 3. The mRNA expression of enzymes PCK1, PCK2, and CPT1 differed between experiments 1 and 2 and was negatively correlated with rumen propionate and butyrate but had a positive relationship with rumen acetate. Similarly, rumen pH was different in experiments 1 and 2, averaging 5.69 in experiment 1 and 4.81 in experiment 2, and there was a negative correlation between mRNA expression of rate-limiting gluconeogenic PCK1, PCK2, and β-oxidation CPT1 enzymes and rumen pH of calves in experiments 1 and 2. We concluded that the physical form of oats in calf starter did not affect gene expression of gluconeogenic and β-oxidation enzymes in preweaned dairy calves. However, lower rumen pH may be related to the upregulation of these enzymes.",

Oats, compared with wheat, barley, and rye, contain less amounts of prolamins. Inclusion of oats in a GFD might be valuable due to their nutritional and health benefits and increase of food variety. Therefore, they may potentially improve feeding diversity for these children and improve taste and satiety. We reviewed the literature to evaluate the safety of oats in CD patients. We have searched PUBMED, societal guidelines and national health authorities' recommendations. The following aspects were reviewed: gastrointestinal symptoms, malabsorption, serology including specific avenin antibodies, mucosal changes, avenin toxicity, immunogenicity of oats, and quality of life. We also referred to wheat contamination of oat products, the safe amount of oats for CD patients and the type of oats recommended. Data support that pure oats are well-tolerated by most CD patients, at moderate amounts (20-25 g/day dry rolled oats for children; 50-70 g/day for adults). Nevertheless, since the potential for sensitivity/toxicity exists, oats should be added with caution to a GFD, only after all CD symptoms including weight loss and growth disturbances have resolved, after at least 6 months of conventional GFD and probably also after normalization of serology. The need for pre exposure biopsy is unclear and should be considered on an individual basis."

      "abstract": "The OsteoArthritis and Therapy for Sleep (OATS) study is a population-based randomized controlled trial of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) with four innovative methodological aims. These are to: (1) Enroll representative participants across Washington state, including those from medically underserved communities; (2) Enroll persons with persistent insomnia and chronic osteoarthritis (OA) pain; (3) Test a scalable CBT-I intervention; and (4) Evaluate patient-reported outcomes (insomnia, pain severity, fatigue, depression) and cost-effectiveness over one year. This paper describes progress towards achieving these aims. The target population was persons age 60+ who had received OA care within the Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPW) health care system. We employed a two-phase screening via mail survey and telephone follow-up, with a 3-week interval between screens to exclude persons with spontaneous improvement in sleep or pain symptoms. Participants were randomized to a 6-session telephone-delivered CBT-I intervention or a 6-session telephone education only control condition (EOC). Blinded outcome assessments (completed online or on mailed paper forms) included primary and secondary sleep and pain outcome measures and quality of life measures. We obtained healthcare utilization from administrative claims data. Intent to treat analyses, including all participants randomized when they scheduled the first telephone session, will be conducted to compare CBT-I and EOC outcomes. The trial will be the largest experimental evaluation of telephone CBT-I to date, and the first to evaluate its cost-effectiveness. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02946957.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of processing methods on cool-season adapted oat grain compared with dry-rolled barley grain, when fed as total mixed ration (TMR) for lactating dairy cows. Eight lactating Holstein cows were used in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with 21-d periods and fed TMR with 1 of 4 treatments: dry-rolled oats, steam-flaked oats, pelleted oats, or dry-rolled barley. Dry matter intake (DMI) ranged from 28.19 to 31.61 kg/d and was lower for rolled oats compared with pelleted oats. Despite the nutrient intake being higher for cows fed pelleted oats, those fed rolled oats had the highest milk production and milk fat percentage (49.23 kg/d and 4%, respectively). Ruminal fermentation characteristics were similar across treatments, with only significant differences in concentrations of acetate (lowest for pelleted oats) and total short-chain fatty acids (highest value for rolled barley) and a lower pH for flaked oats at the 9-h and 12-h points. Dietary treatments did not affect total-tract digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, or CP; digestibility of starch was the lowest for rolled barley (89.04%). Measured blood metabolites, urea, glucose, and β-hydroxybutyrate, were not affected by dietary treatment. Purine derivatives and microbial N supply were also unaffected by dietary treatments. Cows fed flaked oat-based TMR showed the lowest N excretion in milk; however, the lack of difference between diets with regard to urinary N and fecal N excretion resulted in no significant changes in N balance between diets. Therefore, rolled oats allow cows to have higher milk production with lower DMI compared with all other treatments in this study.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To compare the glycaemic response of whole grain oat kernels and pearled oats cooked under normal pressure or higher pressure and examine whether replacing half of the rice in a given meal with either of the two oat grains could make a difference in acute glycaemic responses. METHODS: In a randomised crossover trial, ten healthy subjects consumed two groups of test meals: (1) oat grain-only, including whole grain oats cooked under normal pressure (WONP) and higher pressure (WOHP) as well as their pearled oat counterparts, PONP and POHP; and (2) mixed meals of aforementioned oat grains and cooked rice (OG + R), including WONP + R, WOHP + R, PONP + R and POHP + R. A postprandial blood glucose test, texture profile analysis and in vitro carbohydrate digestion assay were carried out for each test meal. RESULTS: Compared with the rice reference, oat grain-only meals induced lower glucose levels at all time points, lower peak values and smaller glucose excursions at 120 min (P < 0.05), but OG + Rs did not have the abovementioned effects. The oat grain-only meals had glycaemic indexes (GIs) ranging from 51 to 58, while those of OG + Rs ranged from 59 to 70. WONP + R had a 21% lower iAUC0-60 and a 40% lower iAUC60-120 value than those of rice (P < 0.05). Oat-rice mixed meals had lower iAUC0-60 values compared with that of the rice control (P < 0.05), except for POHP + R. Excellent consistency between the hydrolysis index and the GI was observed (r = 0.969, P < 0.001) in oat grain-only meals. CONCLUSIONS: All oat grain-only meals could be included in the glycaemic management diet, regardless of the oat grain type or cooking treatment. In oat-rice mixed meals, whole grain oats and normal pressure cooking ensured a favourable glycaemic effect.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Oats (Avena sativa L.) are a whole grain cereal recognised for their health benefits and which are cultivated largely in temperate regions providing both a source of food for humans and animals, as well as being used in cosmetics and as a potential treatment for a number of diseases. Oats are known as being a cereal source high in dietary fibre (e.g. β-glucans), as well as being high in antioxidants, minerals and vitamins. Recently, oats have been gaining increased global attention due to their large number of beneficial health effects. Consumption of oats has been proven to lower blood LDL cholesterol levels and blood pressure, thus reducing the risk of heart disease, as well as reducing blood-sugar and insulin levels. OBJECTIVES: Oats are seen as a low input cereal. Current agricultural guidelines on nitrogen application are believed to be suboptimal and only consider the effect of nitrogen on grain yield. It is important to understand the role of both variety and of crop management in determining nutritional quality of oats. In this study the response of yield, grain quality and grain metabolites to increasing nitrogen application to levels greater than current guidelines were investigated. METHODS: Four winter oat varieties (Mascani, Tardis, Balado and Gerald) were grown in a replicated nitrogen response trial consisting of a no added nitrogen control and four added nitrogen treatments between 50 and 200 kg N ha-1 in a randomised split-plot design. Grain yield, milling quality traits, β-glucan, total protein and oil content were assessed. The de-hulled oats (groats) were also subjected to a rapid Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) metabolomic screening approach. RESULTS: Application of nitrogen had a significant effect on grain yield but there was no significant difference between the response of the four varieties. Grain quality traits however displayed significant differences both between varieties and nitrogen application level. β-glucan content significantly increased with nitrogen application. The UHPLC-MS approach has provided a rapid, sub 15 min per sample, metabolite profiling method that is repeatable and appropriate for the screening of large numbers of cereal samples. The method captured a wide range of compounds, inclusive of primary metabolites such as the amino acids, organic acids, vitamins and lipids, as well as a number of key secondary metabolites, including the avenanthramides, caffeic acid, and sinapic acid and its derivatives and was able to identify distinct metabolic phenotypes for the varieties studied. Amino acid metabolism was massively upregulated by nitrogen supplementation as were total protein levels, whilst the levels of organic acids were decreased, likely due to them acting as a carbon skeleton source. Several TCA cycle intermediates were also impacted, potentially indicating increased TCA cycle turn over, thus providing the plant with a source of energy and reductant power to aid elevated nitrogen assimilation. Elevated nitrogen availability was also directed towards the increased production of nitrogen containing phospholipids. A number of both positive and negative impacts on the metabolism of phenolic compounds that have influence upon the health beneficial value of oats and their products were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: Although the developed method has broad applicability as a rapid screening method or a rapid metabolite profiling method and in this study has provided valuable metabolic insights, it still must be considered that much greater confidence in metabolite identification, as well as quantitative precision, will be gained by the application of higher resolution chromatography methods, although at a large expense to sample throughput. Follow up studies will apply higher resolution GC (gas chromatography) and LC (reversed phase and HILIC) approaches, oats will be also analysed from across multiple growth locations and growth seasons, effectively providing a cross validation for the results obtained within this preliminary study. It will also be fascinating to perform more controlled experiments with sampling of green tissues, as well as oat grains, throughout the plants and grains development, to reveal greater insight of carbon and nitrogen metabolism balance, as well as resource partitioning into lipid and secondary metabolism.",

The changes in the external and internal microstructures of the ultrasound-treated oats kernel were investigated using Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) and 3D X-ray Micro Computed Tomography (Micro-CT). Physicochemical properties of oats including GABA, free sugars, avenanthramides, total phenolic content, and antioxidant capacities were enhanced after germination. Furthermore, the power ultrasound treatment for 5 min after soaking significantly enhanced the GABA (48-96 h), alanine (24-96 h), succinic acid (48-72 h), total phenolic content (24 h), and total avenanthramides (24 h) in the germinated oats.",

Protein, in exchange for starch and sugar as well as monounsaturated and long chain omega-3-fatty acids and prebiotic β-glucan, are thought to be supportive.In a randomized controlled intervention study, two different dietary concepts were tested regarding effects on intrahepatic lipid content as well as on biochemical parameters in patients with a body-mass-index (BMI) > 30 kg/m2 and signs of fatty liver disease. The intervention group (IG, n = 17) received a commercially available formula diet supplemented with oats fibers. The control group (CG, n = 19) received a comparably restricted diet (approx. 1000 kcal/d) according to the \"low glycemic and insulinemic diet\" method.After twelve weeks, both interventions resulted into a reduction of BMI (IG: 33.8 ± 2.9 to 29.3 ± 2.5 kg/m2, CG: 33.7 ± 2.8 to 30.1 ± 3.2 kg/m2, both p < 0.001), as well as an improvement of liver and other metabolic functions. The hepatorenal index decreased in both groups, however, this reduction was more pronounced in the IG than in the CG (end of the study: 1.1 ± 0.2 vs. 1.9 ± 0.3, p < 0.05). A reduction of blood pressure only occurred in the IG (systolic from 136 ± 15 mmHg to 122 ± 11 mmHg, diastolic from 89 ± 9 mmHg to 79 ± 11 mmHg, both p < 0.01).In conclusion, we found that both dietetic interventions were similarly effective regarding weight reduction, but the formula diet with oats fibers was more effective regarding the reduction of intrahepatic lipid content and blood pressure than the control diet.",

As with all pharmacological treatments, there are risks associated with OAT, including fatal overdose. There is a need to better understand risk for adverse outcomes during and after OAT, and for innovative approaches to identifying people at greatest risk of adverse outcomes. The Opioid Agonist Treatment and Safety study aims to address these questions so as to inform the expansion of OAT in the USA. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a retrospective cohort study using linked, routinely collected health data for all people seeking OAT in New South Wales, Australia, between 2001 and 2017. Linked data include hospitalisation, emergency department presentation, mental health diagnoses, incarceration and mortality. We will use standard regression techniques to model the magnitude and risk factors for adverse outcomes (eg, mortality, unplanned hospitalisation and emergency department presentation, and unplanned treatment cessation) during and after OAT, and machine learning approaches to develop a risk-prediction model. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the Population and Health Services Research Ethics Committee (2018HRE0205).

STUDY DESIGN: This noninferiority clinical trial used a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design extended over 15 months. Three hundred six children with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of celiac disease on a gluten-free diet for ≥2 years were randomly assigned to eat specifically prepared gluten-free food containing an age-dependent amount (15-40 g) of either placebo or purified nonreactive varieties of oats for 2 consecutive 6-month periods separated by washout standard gluten-free diet for 3 months. Clinical (body mass index, Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale score), serologic (IgA antitransglutaminase antibodies, and IgA anti-avenin antibodies), and intestinal permeability data were measured at baseline, and after 6, 9, and 15 months. Direct treatment effect was evaluated by a nonparametric approach using medians (95% CI) as summary statistic. RESULTS: After the exclusion of 129 patients who dropped out, the cohort included 177 children (79 in the oats-placebo and 98 in the placebo-oats group; median, 0.004; 95% CI, -0.0002 to 0.0089). Direct treatment effect was not statistically significant for clinical, serologic, and intestinal permeability variables (body mass index: median, -0.5; 95% CI, -0.12 to 0.00; Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale score: median, 0; 95% CI, -2.5 to 0.00; IgA antitransglutaminase antibodies: median, -0.02; 95% CI, -0.25 to 0.23; IgA anti-avenin antibodies: median, -0.0002; 95% CI, -0.0007 to 0.0003; intestinal permeability test: median, 0.004; 95% CI, -0.0002 to 0.0089).

A high level of α-amylase activity (141.07 U/g) was observed, while xylanase (2.40 U/g), total cellulase (0.52 U/g) and β-glucosidase activities (0.028 U/g) were relatively low in the fermentation system. The phenolic content of oat powder treated with crude enzyme from fermented oats significantly increased, especially that of the ferulic acid in the insoluble fraction and the vanillic acid in the soluble fraction. The surface SEM morphology of the oats showed that the cell wall structure was damaged by the crude enzyme treatment, which led to the release of phenolics.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Improvements in executive functioning (EF) may lead to improved quality of life and lessened functional impairment for children with mood disorders. The aim was to assess the impact of omega-3 supplementation (Ω3) and psychoeducational psychotherapy (PEP), each alone and in combination, on EF in youth with mood disorders. We completed secondary analyses of two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of Ω3 and PEP for children with depression and bipolar disorder. METHODS: Ninety-five youths with depression or bipolar disorder not otherwise specified/cyclothymic disorder were randomized in 12-week RCTs. Two capsules (Ω3 or placebo) were given twice daily (1.87 g Ω3 total daily, mostly eicosapentaenoic acid). Families randomized to PEP participated in twice-weekly 50-min sessions. Analyses assess impact of interventions on the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning (BRIEF) parent-report Global Executive Composite (GEC) and two subscales, Behavior Regulation (BRI) and Metacognition (MI) Indices. Intent-to-treat repeated measures ANOVAs, using multiple imputation for missing data, included all 95 randomized participants. Trials were registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01341925 & NCT01507753. RESULTS: Participants receiving Ω3 (aggregating combined and monotherapy) improved significantly more than aggregated placebo on GEC (p = .001, d = .70), BRI (p = .004, d = .49), and MI (p = .04, d = .41). Ω3 alone (d = .49) and combined with PEP (d = .67) each surpassed placebo on GEC. Moderation by attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) comorbidity was nonsignificant although those with ADHD showed nominally greater gains. PEP monotherapy had negligible effect. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased impairment in EF was associated with Ω3 supplementation in youth with mood disorders. Research examining causal associations of Ω3, EF, and mood symptoms is warranted.",

      "abstract": "A strict gluten-free diet (GFD) can be diversified by non-contaminated oats, but there is a shortage of long-term studies concerning its safety. We compared long-term treatment outcomes and factors associated with the introduction of oats between celiac patients on a GFD with or without oats. Eight hundred sixty-nine previously diagnosed celiac patients were interviewed. The validated Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), Psychological General Well-Being (PGWB), and Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaires were used to assess symptoms and quality of life, serological tests were performed, and results of histology were confirmed from patient records. We found the median duration of GFD to be 10 years and 82% using oats. Factors predicting the consumption of oats were diagnosis after the year 2000, advice from a dietitian, detection by screening, and mild clinical presentation. Oat consumers and non-consumers did not differ in dietary adherence (96.5% vs. 97.4%, p = 0.746), the prevalence of symptoms (22.9% vs. 22.5%, p = 0.931), positivity for endomysial antibodies (8.8% vs. 6.0%, p = 0.237), histological recovery after one year (63.1% vs. 60.0%, p = 0.773), malignancy (4.8% vs. 3.3%, p = 0.420), osteoporosis/osteopenia (9.2% vs. 11.0%, p = 0.489), or fractures (26.9% vs. 27.9%, p = 0.791). The oat consumers had better SF-36 physical role limitations and general health scores. Based on our results, the long-term consumption of oats in celiac disease patients is safe and may improve quality of life.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases are more prevalent and severe in Asian Indians. Simple diet-based strategies are important for prevention of cardiovascular diseases.The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of oats consumption on lipid parameters in mildly hypercholesterolemic Asian Indians living in India. METHODS: A short-term, prospective, open-labeled, randomized controlled, parallel group study was conducted. Mildly hypercholesterolemic (total cholesterol >200 mg/dL and <240 mg/dL) subjects (n = 80) were randomized into two groups: intervention (n = 40) and usual diet (n = 40). Sample size was calculated for a two-group parallel superiority randomized control trial. Out of 80 enrolled subjects 69 subjects completed the study; 33 in the control group and 36 in the intervention group. In the intervention group, patients were served 70 g of oats twice a day in the form of porridge and upma (A thick porridge from oats with seasonings and vegetables) under observation at the study site. Lipid parameters were assessed at baseline and after 4 weeks of intervention. RESULTS: There was a reduction of 3.1% in total cholesterol levels in the control group as against 8.1% reduction in the intervention group (p < 0.02). Greater reductions were also seen in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the intervention group (11.6%) as compared to control group (4.1%, p < 0.04) over a period of 28 days. CONCLUSION: Daily consumption of 3 g of soluble fiber from 70 g of oats leads to beneficial effects on the lipid parameters, specifically total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic Asian Indians. Large scale studies over a longer period of intervention are required to further establish the cholesterol-lowering effect of oat fiber. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was retrospectively registered at clinicaltrials.gov (dated: 25th Februrary.2015) with registration number NCT02376660 .",

These toxins, but also their plant metabolites, may contribute to toxicological effects. This work describes the use of 13C-assisted liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry for the first comprehensive study on the biotransformation of HT2 and T2 in oats. Using this approach, 16 HT2 and 17 T2 metabolites were annotated including novel glycosylated and hydroxylated forms of the toxins, hydrolysis products, and conjugates with acetic acid, putative malic acid, malonic acid, and ferulic acid. Further targeted quantitative analysis was performed to study toxin metabolism over time, as well as toxin and conjugate mobility within non-treated plant tissues. As a result, HT2-3-O-β-d-glucoside was identified as the major detoxification product of both parent toxins, which was rapidly formed (to an extent of 74% in HT2-treated and 48% in T2-treated oats within one day after treatment) and further metabolised. Mobility of the parent toxins appeared to be negligible, while HT2-3-O-β-d-glucoside was partly transported (up to approximately 4%) through panicle side branches and stem. Our findings demonstrate that the presented combination of untargeted and targeted analysis is well suited for the comprehensive elucidation of mycotoxin metabolism in plants.",

Unpredictable overexposure still occurs during some courses despite having controlled the main factors known to play a role in its elimination. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether the urine metabolomic profile measured at the time of MTX administration is predictive of the drug's clearance and/or of treatment-related toxicity. We analyzed the urine content of endogenous metabolites before MTX administration in a cohort of adult patients treated for lymphoid malignancies. Individual MTX clearance (MTXCL) was estimated from population pharmacokinetic analyses of therapeutic drug monitoring data. We determined the urine metabolite content by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and applied Partial Least Square (PLS) analysis to assess the relationship between the urine metabolome and MTXCL. External validation was applied to evaluate the performances of the PLS model. We used orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) to distinguish patients with normal or delayed elimination, and patients with or without toxicity. Sixty-two patients were studied. We obtained a very good prediction of individual MTX clearance using a set of 28 metabolites present in patient urine at baseline. The mean prediction error and precision were -0.36% and 21.4%, respectively, for patients not included in the model. The model included a set of endogenous organic anions, of which the tubular secretion depends on organic anion transporter (OAT) function. Our analyses did not allow us to discriminate between patients with or without delayed elimination or those who did or did not experience toxicity. Urinary metabolomics can be informative about an individual's ability to clear MTX. More broadly, it paves the way for the development of a biomarker of tubular secretion, easily measurable from endogenous substances.",

METHODS: Nine patients with a mean age of 32.1±6.6 (18 to 44) underwent Mega-OATS transplantation with irradiated (2.5Mrad), fresh frozen distal femur allograft. Three patients also underwent ACL-reconstruction; one patient a high tibial osteotomy. The underlying indication was osteochondrosis dissecans in four and trauma in five patients. The defect size was 25×25mm in three patients and 30×30 in six patients and the depth ranged from eight to 14mm. All OCD lesions were located on the medial femoral condyle; two of the traumatic lesions were located on the lateral femoral condyle. Clinical outcome was assessed using the Lysholm and IKDC scores. Radiographic incorporation was evaluated using serial radiographs and MR imaging at one year post surgery. All patients were reviewed at three, six, 12, and 24months following surgery. RESULTS: The Lysholm (IKDC) score improved significantly (p=0.02 resp. p=0.007) within and between patients during the follow-up period from 40.9 (37) to 90.9 (87.1) at 2years. Radiographic union was observed in all patients at three months; on MR imaging at one year osseous integration was observed in eight patients. Graft subsidence with loss of the overlying cartilage was observed in one and subchondral cystic changes at the implantation side were seen in another patient. CONCLUSION: The results of this case series suggest that irradiated osteochondral allograft provides significant medium-term clinical improvement in patients treated for large osteochondral lesions of the femoral condyles.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of morbidity worldwide. Such prevalence justifies the importance of functional foods that promote cardiovascular health, like -glucan present in oats, with potential hypocholesterolemic and hypoglycemic effects. OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the effects of an intervention with oats in blood glucose levels, HOMA-IR index, lipid profile, weight and Body Mass Index (BMI) of adult users of a health service in the interior of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. METHODS: longitudinal study, case-control type with before and after experiment, conducted with individuals that are 22-60 years old, users of a health service. The individuals were distributed in Control (usual diet) and Case (usual diet + 40 g oats/day) groups. There was performed, at the beginning of the study and after eight weeks of monitoring, measuring of height and weight, calculation of BMI (kg/m²), blood collection for measurement of fasting glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, triglycerides and HDL cholesterol; and there were calculated the LDL cholesterol and HOMA-IR index. The data was expressed as mean ± standard deviation and percentages. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Student t test, Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests were applied. A significance level of 5% was adopted (p < 0.05). RESULTS: the sample consisted of 82 subjects, divided into cases (n = 38) and controls (n = 44), mean age 40.07 ± 10.49 years old, 58.5% were women. Comparing the results of all measured parameters at baseline and after eight weeks of monitoring, the Control group did not achieve a significant reduction in any parameter, showing a significant increase in blood glucose and HOMA- IR (p < 0.05). The Intervention group had a significant reduction of all anthropometric and biochemical parameters analyzed (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: the findings demonstrate the beneficial effects of oats to cardiovascular health through significantly improving of the lipid and glycemic profiles, being a potential adjuvant in the prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders.",

      "abstract": "Compounds released by mungbean roots potentially represent an enormous source of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) in mungbean-oat intercropping systems. In this study, an in situ experiment was conducted using a 15N - 13C double stem-feeding method to measure N and C derived from the rhizodeposition (NdfR and CdfR) of mungbean and their transfer to oats in an intercropping system. Mungbean plants were sole cropped (S) or intercropped (I) with oat. The plants were labeled 5 weeks after planting and were harvested at the beginning of pod setting (Ip and Sp) and at maturity (Im and Sm). More than 60% and 50% of the applied 15N and 13C, respectively, were recovered in each treatment, with 15N and 13C being quite uniformly distributed in the different plant parts. NdfR represented 9.8% (Sp), 9.2% (Ip), 20.1% (Sm), and 21.2% (Im) of total mungbean plant N, whereas CdfR represented 13.3% (Sp), 42.0% (Ip), 15.4% (Sm), and 22.6% (Im) of total mungbean plant C. When considering the part of rhizodeposition transferred to associated oat, intercropping mungbean released more NdfR and CdfR than mungbean alone. About 53.4-83.2% of below-ground plant N (BGP-N) and 58.4-85.9% of BGP-C originated from NdfR and CdfR, respectively. The N in oats derived from mungbean increased from 7.6% at the pod setting stage to 9.7% at maturity, whereas the C in oats increased from 16.2% to 22.0%, respectively. Only a small percentage of rhizodeposition from mungbean was transferred to oats in the intercropping systems, with a large percentage remaining in the soil. This result indicates that mungbean rhizodeposition might contribute to higher N and C availability in the soil for subsequent crops.",

METHODS: Four extracts of colloidal oatmeal were made with various solvents and tested in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant assays. In addition, an investigator blind study was performed with twenty-nine healthy female subjects who exhibited bilateral mild to moderate itch with moderate to severe dry skin on their lower legs. Subjects were treated with a colloidal oatmeal skin protectant lotion. RESULTS: Extracts of colloidal oatmeal diminished pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro and the colloidal oat skin protectant lotion showed significant clinical improvements in skin dryness, scaling, roughness, and itch intensity. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that colloidal oat extracts exhibit direct anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, which may provide the mechanisms for observed dermatological benefits while using the colloidal oatmeal skin protectant lotion.",

      "abstract": "Whole-grain foods such as oats may protect against colorectal cancer and have benefits on inflammatory bowel disease and coeliac disease. The present study aimed to systematically review the literature describing intervention studies that investigated the effects of oats or oat bran on risk factors for bowel disease. A literature search was conducted using Embase, Medline and the Cochrane library, which identified 654 potential articles. Thirty-eight articles describing twenty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Two studies carried out in participants with a history of colorectal adenomas found no effects of increased oat-bran intake on indirect risk makers for colorectal cancer. One of two interventions with oat bran in patients with ulcerative colitis showed small improvements in the patients' conditions. Most of the eleven studies carried out in adults with coeliac disease showed no negative effects of uncontaminated oat consumption. The fourteen studies carried out in volunteers with no history of bowel disease suggest that oats or oat bran can significantly increase stool weight and decrease constipation, but there is a lack of evidence to support a specific effect of oats on bowel function compared with other cereals. A long-term dietary intake of oats or oat bran could benefit inflammatory bowel disorders, but this remains to be proven. A protective effect on colorectal adenoma and cancer incidence has not yet been convincingly shown. The majority of patients with coeliac disease could consume up to 100 g/d of uncontaminated oats, which would increase the acceptability of, and adherence to, a gluten-free diet.",

      "abstract": "High consumption of whole-grain food such as oats is associated with a reduced risk of CVD and type 2 diabetes. The present study aimed to systematically review the literature describing long-term intervention studies that investigated the effects of oats or oat bran on CVD risk factors. The literature search was conducted using Embase, Medline and the Cochrane library, which identified 654 potential articles. Seventy-six articles describing sixty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies lacked statistical power to detect a significant effect of oats on any of the risk factors considered: 59 % of studies had less than thirty subjects in the oat intervention group. Out of sixty-four studies that assessed systemic lipid markers, thirty-seven (58 %) and thirty-four (49 %) showed a significant reduction in total cholesterol (2-19 % reduction) and LDL-cholesterol (4-23 % reduction) respectively, mostly in hypercholesterolaemic subjects. Few studies (three and five, respectively) described significant effects on HDL-cholesterol and TAG concentrations. Only three out of twenty-five studies found a reduction in blood pressure after oat consumption. None of the few studies that measured markers of insulin sensitivity and inflammation found any effect after long-term oat consumption. Long-term dietary intake of oats or oat bran has a beneficial effect on blood cholesterol. However, there is no evidence that it favourably modulates insulin sensitivity. It is still unclear whether increased oat consumption significantly affects other risk markers for CVD risk, and comprehensive, adequately powered and controlled intervention trials are required to address this question.",

      "abstract": "Digoxin is the oldest drug for treatment of heart failure still in clinical use. Despite over 200 years of clinical experience with this drug, the optimal serum concentration required for both efficacy and safety remains unknown. It has been suggested that low doses have more favorable effects than higher ones. Cardiac glycosides act on the Na/K-ATPase (NKA). They show an inverted U-shaped dose-response curve with inhibition of pumping at high concentrations while increasing NKA activity at low concentrations. The classical sigmoidal dose-response curve describing an inhibition of the NKA by cardiac glycosides cannot explain this stimulatory effect. Cardiac glycosides are prototypical examples of hormetic substances. Biphasic dose-response curves of cardiac glycosides are also found in their neurohormonal effects. In low concentrations, vagomimetic effects are observed, whereas in high concentrations, sympathomimetic effects dominate. Lipophilic Digitalis glycosides have greater sympathomimetic effects; hydrophilic Strophanthus glycosides have greater vagomimetic effects. For digoxin, as a strong inotrope, there is evidence of only weak modulation of the autonomic nervous system. In ouabain, the modulation of the autonomic nervous system prevails over weak inotropic effects. Vagomimetic and sympatholytic effects characterize the therapeutic effects. In contrast to those of digoxin, the therapeutic effects of ouabain follow exactly the measurable serum concentration. Contrary to common prejudice ouabain is suitable for oral administration. Timely adjustments of dosage to patient therapeutic needs are easy to achieve with orally administered ouabain. Ouabain has the potential to crucially improve our arsenal of heart failure medications. Therefore, a clinical re-evaluation of ouabain is warranted. Randomized double-blind prospective clinical studies with ouabain, which meet today's standards, are worthwhile and necessary.",

Pot experiments with oat plants (Avena sativa) were conducted under greenhouse condition for 60 days. Plant biomass, physiological parameters in leaves, soil enzymes, and degradation rate of total petroleum hydrocarbon were measured. The result demonstrated that petroleum inhibited the growth of the plant; however, inoculation with PGPR in combination with AMF resulted in an increase in dry weight and stem height compared with noninoculated controls. Petroleum stress increased the accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA) and free proline and the activities of the antioxidant enzyme such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase. Application of PGPR and AMF augmented the activities of three enzymes compared to their respective uninoculated controls, but decreased the MDA and free proline contents, indicating that PGPR and AMF could make the plants more tolerant to harmful hydrocarbon contaminants. It also improved the soil quality by increasing the activities of soil enzyme such as urease, sucrase, and dehydrogenase. In addition, the degradation rate of total petroleum hydrocarbon during treatment with PGPR and AMF in moderately contaminated soil reached a maximum of 49.73%. Therefore, we concluded the plants treated with a combination of PGPR and AMF had a high potential to contribute to remediation of saline-alkali soil contaminated with petroleum.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Life-long, strict gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only treatment for celiac disease (CD). Because there is still uncertainty regarding the safety of oats for CD patients, the aim was to investigate whether dietary oats influence the immune status of their intestinal mucosa. METHODS: Paired small intestinal biopsies, before and after >11 months on a GFD, were collected from children with CD who were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind intervention trial to either of two diets: standard GFD (GFD-std; n=13) and noncontaminated oat-containing GFD (GFD-oats; n=15). Expression levels of mRNAs for 22 different immune effector molecules and tight junction proteins were determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. RESULTS: The number of mRNAs that remained elevated was higher in the GFD-oats group (P=0.05). In particular, mRNAs for the regulatory T cell (Treg) signature molecules interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), the cytotoxicity-activating natural killer (NK) receptors KLRC2/NKG2C and KLRC3/NKG2E, and the tight junction protein claudin-4 remained elevated. Between the two groups, most significant differences were seen for claudin-4 (P=0.003) and KLRC3/NKG2E (P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: A substantial fraction of pediatric CD patients seem to not tolerate oats. In these patients, dietary oats influence the immune status of the intestinal mucosa with an mRNA profile suggesting presence of activated cytotoxic lymphocytes and Tregs and a stressed epithelium with affected tight junctions. Assessment of changes in levels of mRNA for claudin-4 and KLC3/NKG2E from onset to after a year on oats containing GFD shows promise to identify these CD patients."

Rhizobacterial isolate CMH3 (P. corrugata) and UW3+UW4 partially alleviated plant salt stress in growth pouch assays. In greenhouse trials, CMH3 enhanced root biomass of barley and oats by 200% and 50%, respectively. UW3+UW4, CMH3 and isolate CMH2 also enhanced barley and oat shoot growth by 100%-150%. In field tests, shoot biomass of oats tripled when treated with UW3+UW4 and doubled with CHM3 compared with that of untreated plants. PGPB treatment did not affect salt uptake on a per mass basis; higher plant biomass led to greater salt uptake, resulting in decreased soil salinity.

Recently, oats free from contamination with wheat have been accepted in the GFD. Yet, reports indicate that all celiac disease patients may not tolerate oats. We hypothesized that celiac children comply well with a GFD and that most have included oats in their diet. A food questionnaire was used to check our patients; 316 questionnaires were returned. Mean time on the GFD was 6.9 years, and 96.8% of the children reported that they were trying to keep a strict GFD. However, accidental transgressions occurred in 263 children (83.2%). In 2 of 3 cases, mistakes took place when the patients were not at home. Symptoms after incidental gluten intake were experienced by 162 (61.6%) patients, mostly (87.5%) from the gastrointestinal tract. Small amounts of gluten (<4 g) caused symptoms in 38% of the cases, and 68% reported symptoms during the first 3 hours after gluten consumption. Oats were included in the diet of 89.4% of the children for a mean of 3.4 years. Most (81.9%) ate purified oats, and 45.3% consumed oats less than once a week. Among those who did not consume oats, only 5.9% refrained because of symptoms. General compliance with the GFD was good. Only the duration of the GFD appeared to influence adherence to the diet.

We have previously reported high faecal SCFA levels in children with coeliac disease (CD), indicating alteration in gut microfloral metabolism. Data accumulated over recent decades by us and others suggest that wheat-free oats can safely be included in a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, concerns have been raised with respect to the safety of oats in a subset of coeliacs. AIM: To describe faecal SCFA patterns in children with newly diagnosed CD treated for 1 year with a GFD with or without oats. METHODS: This report is part of a randomised, double-blind study on the effect of a GFD containing oats (GFD-oats) vs. a standard GFD (GFD-std). Faecal samples were received from 34 children in the GFD-oats group and 37 in the GFD-std group at initial diagnosis and/or after 1 year on a GFD. Faecal SCFAs were analysed. RESULTS: The GFD-std group had a significantly lower total faecal SCFA concentration at 12 months compared with 0 months (P < 0.05). In contrast, total SCFA in the GFD-oats group remained high after 1 year on the GFD. The children in the GFD-oats group had significantly higher acetic acid (P < 0.05), n-butyric acid (P < 0.05) and total SCFA concentration (P < 0.01) after 1-year diet treatment compared to the GFD-std group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that oats do affect the gut microflora function, and that some coeliac children receiving oats may develop gut mucosal inflammation, that may present a risk for future complications.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Although the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is accompanied by an attenuation of viral load, metabolic disorders characterized by hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and lipodystrophy are often observed in patients under this treatment. Certain foods, such as oat bran, soy protein, and flaxseed, have been shown to improve a patient's lipid profile despite possible increases in uricemia. Thus, a bioactive compound was formulated using these foods to help patients with HIV/AIDS control metabolic disorders resulting from HAART. METHODS: An uncontrolled before and after study was performed. The total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and uric acid before and after 3 months of consuming the formulation were compared in patients. The compound was formulated such that 40g (the recommended daily intake) contained approximately 10g of flaxseed, 20g of oat bran, and 10g of textured soy protein. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 139 patients, 31 of whom were included in the final analysis. There were no significant variations between the laboratory results obtained before and after consumption of the compound. CONCLUSIONS: The regular consumption of the formulation together with individualized dietary guidance did not reduce lipid levels and did not contribute to an increase in uricemia in the study group. However, new studies with higher doses of the foods that compose the formulation should be encouraged to investigate whether these foods can positively influence the lipid profiles of these patients.",

      "abstract": "A gluten-free diet (GFD) is currently the only available treatment for patients with celiac disease (CD). Several clinical trials have demonstrated that most celiac patients can tolerate a medium-high quantity of oats without any negative clinical effects; however, the inclusion of oats in GFD is still a matter of debate. In this study, Italian children with CD were enrolled in a 15-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial. Participants were randomized in two groups following either A-B treatment (6 months of diet \"A\", 3 months of standard GFD, 6 months of diet \"B\"), or B-A treatment (6 months of diet \"B\", 3 months of standard GFD, 6 months of diet \"A\"). A and B diets included gluten-free (GF) products (flour, pasta, biscuits, cakes and crisp toasts) with either purified oats or placebo. Clinical data (Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rate Scale [GSRS] score) and intestinal permeability tests (IPT), were measured through the study period. Although the study is still blinded, no significant differences were found in GSRS score or the urinary lactulose/mannitol (L/M) ratio between the two groups after 6 months of treatment. These preliminary results suggest that the addition of non-contaminated oats from selected varieties in the treatment of children with CD does not determine changes in intestinal permeability and gastrointestinal symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Coeliac disease is a permanent inflammatory disorder of the small bowel affecting approximately 1% of the population. The only effective treatment that exists is exclusion of gluten from the diet. The present paper aims to review the literature as to whether oats are safe to eat for people with coeliac disease. Much data exist on the restrictive nature that adhering to a gluten-free diet imposes on an individual. If oats could be eaten, this would help reduce the restrictive nature of the diet. This in turn could lead to an increase in the quality of life. Oats are of high-nutritional value, providing a rich source of fibre, vitamins and minerals. The fibre source contains soluble fibre which is believed to help reduce LDL-cholesterol. A systematic review of the literature was conducted. Earlier studies conducted are difficult to compare as they used different methodologies and it is not known whether samples of oats in the studies were contaminated with gluten from other cereals. Many studies reviewed do not state the strain of oat used. Recent research has suggested that it may only be in certain strains of oats which could produce a toxic response to people with coeliac disease. In conclusion, research suggests that the risk from consuming oats may be less harmful than first thought; however, may vary according to the strain of oat. Handling that risk in clinical practice remains controversial.",

The EA subfraction showed the highest inhibitory effect on pancreatic lipase activity at 1.5 mg/mL compared to the other subfractions, regardless of whether the oats were fermented. Meanwhile, both of the EA subfractions of two fungi-fermented oats demonstrated more effective inhibitory activity than that of nonfermented oats. A positive correlation between the total phenolics content and inhibitory activity was found. The inhibitory ability of the EA subfraction from nonfermented or fermented oats also displayed a dose-dependent effect. The standards of caffeic, ferulic, and p-coumaric acids, mainly included in EA subfractions of fermented oats, also displayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect. A synergistic effect of each binary combination of p-coumaric, ferulic, and caffeic acids was observed, especially at 150.0 μg/mL. Those results indicate that fungi-fermented oats have a more effective inhibitory ability on pancreatic lipase and polyphenols may be the most effective component and could be potentially used for dietary therapy of obesity.",

The conversion and extraction of the major carbohydrates and lignin from the reactor system during hydrothermal treatment was largely completed within the first 20-30min. Glucan content of all straws were enriched by the process. More than 90% of the xylan and nearly 50% of the lignin were extracted and there was no effect on yield due to crop species. However, there were differences in solid residue and liquid extract composition. Cereal crops yielded a residue richer in glucan and lower in lignin. Oilseed crop residues contained very low levels of ash. Xylo-oligosaccharides from oilseed crops contain more acetyl and uronic acid substituents.",

      "abstract": "The human organic anion and cation transporters are classified within two SLC superfamilies. Superfamily SLCO (formerly SLC21A) consists of organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs), while the organic anion transporters (OATs) and the organic cation transporters (OCTs) are classified in the SLC22A superfamily. Individual members of each superfamily are expressed in essentially every epithelium throughout the body, where they play a significant role in drug absorption, distribution and elimination. Substrates of OATPs are mainly large hydrophobic organic anions, while OATs transport smaller and more hydrophilic organic anions and OCTs transport organic cations. In addition to endogenous substrates, such as steroids, hormones and neurotransmitters, numerous drugs and other xenobiotics are transported by these proteins, including statins, antivirals, antibiotics and anticancer drugs. Expression of OATPs, OATs and OCTs can be regulated at the protein or transcriptional level and appears to vary within each family by both protein and tissue type. All three superfamilies consist of 12 transmembrane domain proteins that have intracellular termini. Although no crystal structures have yet been determined, combinations of homology modelling and mutation experiments have been used to explore the mechanism of substrate recognition and transport. Several polymorphisms identified in members of these superfamilies have been shown to affect pharmacokinetics of their drug substrates, confirming the importance of these drug transporters for efficient pharmacological therapy. This review, unlike other reviews that focus on a single transporter family, briefly summarizes the current knowledge of all the functionally characterized human organic anion and cation drug uptake transporters of the SLCO and the SLC22A superfamilies.",

OAT1 and OAT3 are located in the basolateral membrane of renal proximal tubule cells and are responsible for drug uptake from the blood into the cells. OAT4 in the apical membrane of human proximal tubule cells is related to drug exit into the lumen and to uptake of estrone sulfate and urate from the lumen into the cell. URAT1 is the major urate-absorbing transporter in the apical membrane and is a target for uricosuric drugs. OAT10, also located in the luminal membrane, transports nicotinate with high affinity and interacts with drugs. Major extrarenal locations of OATs include the blood-brain barrier for OAT3, the placenta for OAT4, the nasal epithelium for OAT6, and the liver for OAT2 and OAT7. For all transporters we provide information on cloning, tissue distribution, factors influencing OAT abundance, interaction with endogenous compounds and different drug classes, drug/drug interactions and, if known, single nucleotide polymorphisms.",

In the near future, maximum levels for these trichothecenes will be regulated by the European Commission as announced in EU (VO) 1881/2006. For the implementation of these maximum levels, more data on occurrence and behaviour of T-2 and HT-2 toxins in primary agricultural products as well as during cleaning treatment and food processing are needed. In the current work, we determined the T-2/HT-2 concentrations in four oat cultivars (Aragon, Dominik, Ivory, Pergamon) from ten different agricultural sites in Germany, grown in cultivar studies in 2007. The grains were de-hulled, oat meal was prepared, and bread with 20% oat meal and 80% wheat flour was baked. In the cereal-processing chain, samples were taken at various steps and subsequently analysed for their T-2/HT-2 content. We employed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and an immunological screening method (enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA)) for T-2/HT-2 determination. Detection limits were between 1 and 10 microg kg(-1) in different matrices. T-2/HT-2 concentrations determined by ELISA in oat samples from ten different agricultural sites in Germany were between 9 and 623 microg kg(-1). The median and 90th percentile were 48 and 191 microg kg(-1) T-2/HT-2, respectively. One site showed six times higher T-2/HT-2 levels than the other sites, where concentrations ranged from 322 to 623 microg kg(-1). In 80% of the samples the cultivars Pergamon and Ivory had the lowest concentration of T-2 and HT-2 toxins. Using LC-MS for T-2/HT-2 determination, cleaning of the raw material did not lead to significant reductions of T-2 and HT-2 levels, whereas de-hulling led to a reduction of over 90%. Boiling of oat meal produced from cleaned raw material to yield 'porridge' resulted in varying T-2/HT-2 levels in experimental replicates. No major reduction of T-2/HT-2 levels in cooked porridge was obtained. Standardized baking experiments using 20% oat meal showed that T-2 and HT-2 toxins are relatively stable during the baking process, probably due to their temperature stability.",

Changes of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity were investigated in oats during steeping and germination. Results revealed that phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity of oats varied with the difference in steeping and germination stages. Compared with raw grains, short-term steeping treatment did not show significant effects (p > 0.05) on phenolic content. Germination can significantly result in the decrease in bound phenolic and the increase in free and total phenolics. Main phenolic acids and avenanthramides were isolated and quantified by HPLC analysis. During steeping, phenolic acids decreased (p < 0.05); avenanthramide N-(3',4'-dihydroxy)-(E)-cinnamoyl-5-hydroxyanthranilic acid first decreased and then increased (p < 0.05), while avenanthramides N-(4'-hydroxy)-(E)-cinnamoyl-5-hydroxyanthranilic acid and N-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxy)-(E)-cinnamoyl-5-hydroxyanthranilic acid did not change significantly (p > 0.05). During germination, gallic and caffeic acids first increased (p < 0.05) and then decreased, whereas p-coumaric and ferulic acids and avenanthramides increased (p < 0.05). Nevertheless, avenanthramides did not change significantly (p > 0.05) during the last stage of germination. Oat extracts exhibited increasing high antioxidant activity with the steeping and germination going on, which may explain that antioxidant activity correlated (p < 0.01) significantly with the content of phenolic compounds.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: We have shown earlier that consumption of moderate amount of oats improve intakes of vitamin B(1), fiber, magnesium and iron in celiac patients using gluten-free diet (GFD). The objective of this study was to clarify the effect of high amount of both kilned and unkilned oats on food and nutrient intakes in celiac patients in remission. Kilning as an industrial heating process is performed to preserve the main properties of oats and to lengthen its useableness. Kilning may, however, change the protein structure of oats and therefore influence on the intake of nutrients. SUBJECTS/METHODS: The study group consisted of 13 men and 18 women with celiac disease in remission. The patients who were earlier using moderate amount of oats as part of their GFD were randomized to consume kilned or unkilned oats. After 6 months, the patients changed the treatment groups. The goal of daily intake of oats was 100 g. Food records and frequency questionnaire were used to follow nutrient intakes. RESULTS: Type of oats did not affect the amount of oats used. In the group using kilned oats, the intake of vitamin B1 and magnesium and in the group of unkilned oats that of magnesium and zinc increased significantly during the first 6 months (P<or=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: :Large amounts of oats, both kilned and unkilned in GFD, can increase intakes of nutrients in celiac patients in remission. Oats improve the nutritional value of GFD.",

      "abstract": "Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disease, triggered in genetically susceptible individuals by ingested gluten from wheat, rye, barley, and other closely related cereal grains. The only treatment for celiac disease is a strict gluten-free diet for life. This paper presents a systematic review of the scientific literature on the safety of pure oats for individuals with celiac disease, which historically has been subject to debate. Limitations identified within the scientific database include: limited data on long-term consumption, limited numbers of participants in challenge studies, and limited reporting about the reasons for withdrawals from study protocols. Furthermore, some evidence suggests that a small number of individuals with celiac disease may be intolerant to pure oats and some evidence from in vitro studies suggests that an immunological response to oat avenins can occur in the absence of clinical manifestations of celiac disease as well as suggesting that oat cultivars vary in toxicity. Based on the majority of the evidence provided in the scientific database, and despite the limitations, Health Canada and the Canadian Celiac Association (CCA) concluded that the majority of people with celiac disease can tolerate moderate amounts of pure oats. The incorporation of oats into a gluten-free diet provides high fiber and vitamin B content, increased palatability, and beneficial effects on cardiovascular health. However, it is recommended that individuals with celiac disease should have both initial and long-term assessments by a health professional when introducing pure oats into a gluten-free diet.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: A gluten-free diet omitting wheat, rye, and barley is the only effective treatment for coeliac disease. The necessity of excluding oats from the diet has remained controversial. We studied the toxicity of oats in children with coeliac disease during a 2-year follow-up by investigating jejunal transglutaminase 2 (TG2)-targeted IgA-class autoantibody deposits, a potentially more sensitive disease marker than serum antibodies or conventional histology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-three coeliac children in remission were randomized to undergo oat or gluten challenge with wheat, rye, barley, and oats. When jejunal histological relapse was evident after gluten challenge, patients excluded wheat, rye, and barley but continued with oats. Mucosal morphology and TG2-targeted autoantibody deposits were studied in jejunal biopsies taken at baseline and after 6 and 24 months. Furthermore, serum IgA-class TG2 antibodies were measured. RESULTS: At baseline, serum TG2 antibodies were negative in all 23 patients, but 7 of them had minor mucosal deposits. In the oats group, there was no significant change in the intensity of the deposits within 2 years. In contrast, during the gluten challenge, the intensity of the deposits clearly increased and decreased again when wheat, rye, and barley were excluded but consumption of oats was continued; this was in line with serum autoantibodies. The intensity of the mucosal deposits correlated well with both villous morphology and serum autoantibody levels. CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of oats does not induce TG2 autoantibody production at mucosal level in children with coeliac disease. Measurement of small-intestinal mucosal autoantibody deposits is suitable for monitoring treatment in coeliac patients.",

For assessment of tubal status, hysterosalpingography (HSG) is recommended as a first-line investigation for women not known to have comorbidities. AIM: To test whether providing GPs with open access to HSG results in infertile couples progressing to a diagnosis and management plan sooner than with usual management. DESIGN OF STUDY: A pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Seventy-one of 173 general practices in north-east England agreed to participate. METHOD: A total of 670 infertile couples presented to 33 intervention practices and 25 control practices over a 2-year period. Practices allocated to the intervention group had access to HSG for those infertile women who fulfilled predefined eligibility criteria. The primary outcome measure was the interval between presentation to the GP and the couple receiving a diagnosis and management plan. RESULTS: An annual incidence of 0.8 couples per 1000 total population equated to each GP seeing an average of one or two infertile couples each year. Open access HSG was used for 9% of all infertile women who presented to the intervention practices during the study period. The time to reach a diagnosis and management plan for all infertile couples presenting was not affected by the availability of open access HSG (Cox regression hazard ratio = 0.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.7 to 1.1). For couples who reached a diagnosis and management plan, there was a non-significant difference in time to primary outcome for intervention versus control practices (32.5 weeks versus 30.5 weeks, mean difference 2.2 weeks, 95% CI = 1.6 to 6.1 weeks, P = 0.1). The intracluster correlation coefficient was 0.03 across all practices. CONCLUSION: Providing GPs with open access to HSG had no effect on the time taken to reach a diagnosis and management plan for couples with infertility.",

INDICATIONS: Extensive osteochondral defects (traumatic, posttraumatic, osteochondrosis dissecans, focal osteochondronecrosis) within the weight-bearing zone of the femoral condyle. Comorbidities such as malalignment and ligament instabilities should be addressed prior to or, ideally, simultaneously with the Mega-OATS intervention. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Delocalized uni- and multicompartmental osteochondral lesions of the knee. Tricompartmental knee arthrosis. Acute and chronic arthritis or infection of the knee. Chondrocalcinosis. Not simultaneously corrected or noncorrectable malalignment or ligamentous instabilities. Patient's age > 55 years. Postoperative continuation of activities with high loading stresses at high knee flexion angles, e.g. pavior, downhill ski racer. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Anteromedial or anterolateral arthrotomy. Exposure and measurement of the affected osteochondral area. Reaming of the defect until attainment of a vital bed of the defect. Measurement of the depths of the prepared defect. Removal of the medial posterior femoral condyle. Preparation of the cylinder of the transplant harvested from the removed posterior femoral condyle using a specially designed Mega-OATS workstation (diameter between 20 and 35 mm). Placement of the Mega-OATS cylinder in press-fit technique. POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT: Initial continuous passive motion therapy, active range of motion 90 degrees -0 degrees -0 degrees , and unloading for 6 weeks postoperatively using crutches, followed by progressive weight bearing with 20 kg per week until full weight bearing. Free active range of motion as tolerated from 7th week. Four-point hard-frame knee orthosis for 6 weeks. Concomitant intensive muscle and proprioceptive training from 3rd to 6th month. Specific sports rehabilitation program starting 7th month. RESULTS: The initial 17 and 16 patients following Mega-OATS procedure due to a large osteochondral defect (average size 6 cm2, range 4-9 cm2) of the femoral condyle were clinically examined including an image-guided evaluation protocol at an average follow-up of 12 and 55 months, respectively. In the Lysholm Score, there was a significant increase from 62 +/- 4 points (mean +/- SEM [standard error of the mean]) preoperatively to 85 +/- 7 points at 12 months and 81 +/- 4 points at 55 months postoperatively. In nine patients with varus malalignment, a simultaneous high tibial osteotomy was performed. However, a significant difference in the Lysholm Score between the subgroup with and without simultaneous high tibial osteotomy could not be found. In more than 90% of the patients, a high subjective satisfaction rate was noted. Randomized magnetic resonance images revealed a good viability of the Mega-OATS graft as well as an intact posterior horn of the ipsilateral meniscus.",

      "abstract": "The production of oat (Avena sativa L.) phytoalexins, avenanthramides, occurs in response to elicitor treatment with oligo-N-acetylchitooligosaccharides. In this study, avenanthramides production was investigated by techniques that provide high spatial and temporal resolution in order to clarify the process of phytoalexin production at the cellular level. The amount of avenanthramides accumulation in a single mesophyll cell was quantified by a combination of laser micro-sampling and low-diffuse nanoflow liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) techniques. Avenanthramides, NAD(P)H and chlorophyll were also visualized in elicitor-treated mesophyll cells using line-scanning fluorescence microscopy. We found that elicitor-treated mesophyll cells could be categorized into three characteristic cell phases, which occurred serially over time. Phase 0 indicated the normal cell state before metabolic or morphological change in response to elicitor, in which the cells contained abundant NAD(P)H. In phase 1, rapid NAD(P)H oxidation and marked movement of chloroplasts occurred, and this phase was the early stage of avenanthramides biosynthesis. In phase 2, avenanthramides accumulation was maximized, and chloroplasts were degraded. Avenanthramides appear to be synthesized in the chloroplast, because a fluorescence signal originating from avenanthramides was localized to the chloroplasts. Moreover, our results indicated that avenanthramides biosynthesis and the hypersensitive response (HR) occurred in identical cells. Thus, the avenanthramides production may be one of sequential events programmed in HR leading to cell death. Furthermore, the phase of the defense response was different among mesophyll cells simultaneously treated with elicitor. These results suggest that individual cells may have different susceptibility to the elicitor.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The induction of defense compounds in oats (Avena sativa) in response to invasion by parasitic nematodes and to application of the wound hormone methyl jasmonate was examined. Oats cv. Quoll seedlings were challenged with Pratylenchus neglectus, Heterodera avenae, and Ditylenchus dipsaci and treated with 1 x 10(-4) M methyl jasmonate. Three compounds, isolated in methanolic root and shoot extracts of oats, exhibiting an absorbance spectrum typical of flavone glycosides, were induced by nematode invasion and methyl jasmonate. These were identified as flavone-C-glycosides by mass spectrometry. The effect of the flavone-C-glycosides on the invasion by and development of cereal cyst nematode H. avenae was assessed using methanolic extracts of shoots and roots from methyl jasmonate-treated plants. Both extracts impaired nematode invasion and development. When the extracts were fractionated by high voltage paper electrophoresis, only one flavone-C-glycoside, O-methyl-apigenin-C-deoxyhexoside-O-hexoside, inhibited nematode invasion. The protective effect of the induction of flavone-C-glycosides in oats by methyl jasmonate was evaluated against H. avenae and P. neglectus. Treatment with methyl jasmonate reduced invasion of both nematodes and increased plant mass, compensating for damage caused by the nematodes, and is attributed to the active flavone-C-glycoside. The active compound, O-methyl-apigenin-C-deoxyhexoside-O-hexoside, has not been implicated previously in plant defense against any pest or pathogen, and appears to provide protection against the major cereal nematodes Heterodera and Pratylenchus."

Oats is generally processed by kilning, which theoretically may change its antigenic properties and be the reason that it is tolerated by patients with CD. The aim of this study was to investigate the suitability of large amounts of unkilned oats, comparing its use with kilned oats in adult coeliac patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group included 13 men and 19 women with CD in remission. The goal of daily intake of oats was 100 g during one year. These patients using oats as part of their gluten-free diet were randomized to two treatment groups. One group used regular oats and the other unkilned oats. After 6 months the patients changed the treatment groups. Food intake, symptoms, histology of the small intestine and the levels of endomysial antibodies were noted. RESULTS: No marked changes were found in the duodenal biopsies, in the levels of endomysial antibodies or in the well-being of the patients. Compliance with the diet did not change during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Large amounts of both unkilned and regular kilned oats are well tolerated by adult patients with CD. Oats is therefore not harmful, even in its unkilned form, which indicates that its antigenic nature is not changed by common industrial food processing in such a way that would prevent the provoking of CD.",

      "abstract": "Sea oats (Uniola paniculata L.) are the dominant plant in the pioneer coastal dunes of Florida and are widely used for dune restoration. DNA analysis has revealed significant ecotypic variation among Atlantic and Gulf coast populations of sea oats, but little is known about the diversity of the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) communities present in the dune systems. In a prior greenhouse study, we evaluated the functional diversity that exists among the AM fungal communities from divergent Florida dunes and selected effective host/AM fungus combinations for further study. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of these compatible combinations on the growth of sea oats planted at Anastasia State Recreation Area (AN) on the Atlantic coast and St. George Island State Park (SG) on the Gulf coast. Micropropagated sea oats from each site were inoculated with AM fungal communities also from AN and SG or a microbial filtrate control. The complete factorial of treatment combinations were grown in the greenhouse for 8 weeks and outplanted to the AN and SG field sites. After 1 year, root colonization was evaluated, and after 2 years, root colonization, shoot and root dry masses, and shoot- and root-P contents were determined. Overall, sea oats planted at AN had greater percent root colonization, shoot dry mass, and shoot-P content than those planted at SG. At AN, the local sea oat ecotype responded more to the fungal community from the same site relative to shoot dry mass and shoot-P content. At SG, the local fungal community produced larger plants with greater P content regardless of the origin of the host. We conclude that sea oat productivity is responsive to AM fungal ecotype as well as host ecotype, and fungal origin should therefore be taken into account when planning sea oat plantings on coastal dunes.",

      "abstract": "The treatment of celiac disease is a strict adherence to a gluten-free diet for life. In the past, oats were considered to be toxic to individuals with celiac disease and were not allowed in a gluten-free diet. However, recent evidence suggests that oats that are pure and uncontaminated with other gluten-containing grains, if taken in limited quantities, are safe for most individuals with celiac disease. For adults, up to 70 g (1/2 to 3/4 cup) of oats per day and for children, up to 25 g (1/4 cup) per day are safe to consume. These oats and oat products must fulfill the standards for a gluten-free diet set by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Health Canada. The Canadian Celiac Association, in consultation with Health Canada, Agriculture & Agri-Food Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, has established requirements for growing, processing, and purity testing and labelling of pure oats. These strategies have led to the production of pure, uncontaminated oats for the first time in Canada. Oats and oat products that are safe for consumption by individuals with celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis are now commercially available in Canada.",

The objective of the present study was to clarify its applicability by analysing local cellular immunological responses after 5 years' consumption of oats by adult coeliac patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-two coeliac patients took part in an earlier oats intervention study for 6-12 months. Twenty-two of these patients originally consumed oats as part of their gluten-free diet. During the 5-year follow-up 10 patients had felt uncertain about the safety of long-term consumption of oats and gave up this part of their diet. Finally, 12 of the 22 patients consumed oats for the whole 5-year period. The control group consisted of the remaining 20 coeliac patients using a strict, conventional, gluten-free diet without oats. Intraepithelial CD3, alphabetaTCR (alphabetaIEL) and gammadeltaTCR (gammadeltaIEL) T cells were counted after specific staining of small intestinal biopsy specimens. RESULTS: There were no differences in the densities of CD3, alphabetaIEL and gammadeltaIEL T cells between the oat and the control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term use of oats included in the gluten-free diets of patients with coeliac disease does not stimulate an immunological response locally in the mucosa of the small intestine.",

In the present study, we further investigated its cell cycle inhibitory mechanism. Rat embryonic aortic smooth muscle cell line A10 was used in this study. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that treatment of A10 cells with 80 muM Avn-c arrested the cell cycle in G1 phase as indicated by an increase in the number of cells in G1 phase and a decrease in the number of cells in S phase. This cell cycle arrest was associated with a decrease in the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRb), whose hyperphosphorylation is a hallmark of the G1 to S transition in the cell cycle. The inhibition of pRb phosphorylation with Avn-c was accompanied by a decrease in cyclin D1 expression and an increase in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21cip1 expression, without significant changes in p27kip1 expression. Furthermore, Avn-c treatment increased the expression level and stability of p53 protein, which could account for the increase of p21cip1 expression. Our results demonstrate for the first time that Avn-c, which is a unique polyphenol found in oats, arrests SMC proliferation at G1 phase by upregulating the p53-p21cip1 pathway and inhibiting pRB phosphorylation. This inhibitory effect of Avn-c on SMC proliferation is an additional indication for the potential health benefit of oat consumption in the prevention of coronary heart disease beyond its known effect through lowering blood cholesterol.",

METHODS: Altogether 32 children with coeliac disease were enrolled in a 2-year controlled trial. Twenty-three children in remission were randomized either to oats or gluten challenge; when small bowel histological relapse was evident after gluten challenge, a gluten-free diet including oats was started. Furthermore, nine newly detected coeliac patients adopted an oat-containing gluten-free diet. Small bowel mucosal morphology, CD3+, alphabeta+ and gammadelta+ intraepithelial lymphocytes, human leucocyte antigen (HLA) DR expression and coeliac serology were determined. After the trial, the children were allowed to eat oats freely; follow-up was extended up to 7 years. RESULTS: In coeliac children in remission, oats had no detrimental effect on intestinal histology or serology during the 2-year trial. In contrast, the gluten-challenge group relapsed after 3-12 months. Complete recovery from the disease was accomplished in all relapsed and newly detected patients on an oat-containing gluten-free diet. After the trial, 86% of the children preferred to consume oats and they all remained in remission. CONCLUSION: In most children with coeliac disease, long-term consumption of oats is well tolerated, and it does not result in small bowel mucosal deterioration or immune activation.",

      "abstract": "The proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) and impaired nitric oxide (NO) production are both crucial pathophysiological processes in the initiation and development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiological data have indicated that diets rich in whole grain foods are associated with a reduced risk of developing atherosclerosis. Avenanthramides are polyphenols found exclusively in oats (Avena sativa L.). The present study was conducted to examine the effect of synthetically prepared avenanthramide-2c on the proliferation of SMC and NO production by SMC and human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC). Avenanthramide-2c significantly inhibited serum-induced SMC proliferation. At a concentration of 120 microM, avenanthramide-2c inhibited more than 50% of SMC proliferation, as measured by [3H] thymidine incorporation, and increased the doubling time of rat SMC line (A10) from 28 to 48 h. Treatment of human SMC with 40, 80, and 120 microM avenanthramide-2c inhibited cell number increase by 41, 62, and 73%, respectively. In addition, avenanthramide-2c treatment significantly and dose-dependently increased NO production in both SMC and HAEC. At a concentration of 120 microM, avenanthramide-2c increased NO production by three-fold in SMC, and by nine-fold in HAEC. These increases were in parallel with the up-regulation of mRNA expression for endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) in both vascular SMC and HAEC. These results suggest that the avenanthramides of oats may contribute to the prevention of atherosclerosis through inhibition of SMC proliferation and increasing NO production.",

We report our experience on the use of osteochondral allografts with the MEGA-OATS technique in the management of large osteochondral defects of the knee in young patients. Five patients (3 male and 2 female) were included in this study; their age ranged from 22 to 41 years and the mean size of the defect covered was 30 x 30 mm. They were followed for a minimum of 2.5 years (mean: 32.8 months, range 30-36). An age- and size-matched fresh frozen, non-irradiated distal femoral allograft was used to obtain the donor plug, which was then inserted in the recipient area in a press-fit fashion. Patients' Lysholm knee score increased from 37.8 pre-operatively to 73.8 post-operatively. Tegner activity score increased in all five patients; it improved from a mean of 2 pre-operatively (range 1-3) to 4 post-operatively (range 2-7). Four out of five patients returned to work and three went back to sporting activities. With this technique one can cover sizeable osteochondral defects, and compensate for significant subchondral bone loss, while accurate reconstruction of the curvature of the femoral condyle is allowed. We believe that it is a viable salvage option in young patients with big osteochondral defects of the knee. It offers very satisfactory functional results and does not compromise patients' future options.",

DESIGN: Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial Intervention(s): Subjects (16 males > or = age 35; 14 postmenopausal females) were assigned, in random order, to oats (60 g oatmeal), vitamin E (400 IU) plus vitamin C (500 mg), the combination of oats and vitamins, or placebo, and underwent brachial artery reactivity scans (BARS) following a single dose of each treatment, and again following 6 weeks of daily ingestion, with 2-week washout periods. At each test, a provocation high-fat meal (50 g, predominantly saturated) was administered and subjects were scanned pre, and 3 hours post-ingestion. RESULTS: Mean flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD; measured as percent diameter change before and after treatments) at baseline was 6.35 +/- 3.37. Oats increased FMD non-significantly (p > 0.05) with both single acute dose (from 6.07 +/- 6.25 to 9.22 +/- 8.82) and six weeks of sustained treatment (from 6.01 +/- 10.07 to 8.69 +/- 8.42). The direction of effect was negative for vitamins and the oat/vitamin combination with both acute and sustained treatment. There were no significant differences in FMD change among the treatments in either phase of the study, however when acute and sustained effects were pooled, oat treatment significantly augmented FMD (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This trial suggests but does not confirm a beneficial influence of oat ingestion on endothelial function in overweight, dyslipidemic adults. Further study of this potential association is warranted.",

      "abstract": "Oat leaves produce phytoalexins, avenanthramides, in response to infection by pathogens or treatment with elicitors. The metabolism of avenanthramides was investigated using low molecular weight, partially deacetylated chitin as an elicitor. When oat leaf segments are floated on the elicitor solution, avenanthramides accumulate in the solution. The transfer of elicited oat leaves to solutions containing stable-isotope-labeled avenanthramides resulted in a rapid decrease in the labeled avenanthramides, suggesting the metabolism of avenanthramides. The rate of decrease was enhanced by elicitor treatment, and was dependent on the species of avenanthramides, with avenanthramide B decreasing most rapidly. The rates of biosynthesis and metabolism of avenanthramides A and B were measured using a model of isotope-labeling dynamics. Avenanthramide B was found to be more actively biosynthesized and metabolized than avenanthramide A. Radiolabeled avenanthramide B was incorporated into the cell wall fraction and 99% of incorporated activity was released by alkaline treatment. Gel filtration indicated that high-molecular-weight compounds derived from avenanthramide B were released by alkaline treatment. The decrease in stable-isotope-labeled avenanthramides was suppressed by catalase, salicylhydroxamic acid, and sodium ascorbate, suggesting the involvement of peroxidase in the metabolism. Consistent with this, peroxidase activity that accepts avenanthramide B as a substrate was induced in apoplastic fractions by elicitor treatment. The appearance of multiple basic isoperoxidases was observed by activity staining with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole coupled with isoelectric focusing of proteins from elicitor-treated leaves. These findings suggest that accumulated avenanthramides are further metabolized in apoplasts in oat leaves by inducible isoperoxidases.",
