      "abstract": "Background: The efficacy of banaba leaf extract was tested against carboxymethyllysine (CML)-induced toxicity in embryos and adult zebrafish. Additionally, the individual and combined effects of banaba (BNB) and policosanol (PCO) were analyzed to alleviate dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and associated effects in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced hyperlipidemic diabetic zebrafish. Methodology: The high cholesterol diet (HCD, final 4%, w/w)-fed zebrafish were injected with STZ to develop diabetes and were subsequently fed with either HCD or HCD+BNB (final 0.1% w/w) or HCD+PCO (final 0.1% w/w) or HCD+BNB+PCO (each final 0.1%, w/w) each for 14 days. The zebrafish tail fin was amputated to assess tissue regeneration, while the organs and blood were collected for histological and biochemical analysis. Results: Severely compromised embryo survivability and developmental defects were noticed in the CML-injected group that significantly improved following BNB exposure. Similarly, CML-induced acute paralysis and mortality of adult zebrafish were effectively mitigated by the treatment with BNB. In the hyperlipidemic diabetic zebrafish, both BNB and PCO supplementation displayed the hypoglycemic effect; however, a remarkable reduction (p < 0.05) in blood glucose levels was observed in the BNB+PCO group, around 14% and 16% less than the BNB group and PCO group, respectively. Likewise, higher tail fin regeneration was noticed in response to BNB+PCO supplementation. Both BNB and PCO have a substantial counter-effect against HCD+STZ-induced dyslipidemia. However, the combined supplementation (BNB+PCO) displayed a significantly better effect than that of BNB and PCO alone to alleviate total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The most impressive impact of BNB+PCO was noticed in the elevation of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), which was ~1.5 times higher than the HDL-C level in response to BNB and PCO. Also, BNB+PCO effectively reduced the malondialdehyde (MDA) and elevated the plasma sulfhydryl content, paraoxonase (PON), and ferric ion reduction (FRA) activity. Histological analyses revealed a significant effect of BNB+PCO in preventing inflammatory infiltration, fatty liver changes, and interleukin-6 production. Similarly, a notably better effect of BNB+PCO compared to their individual effect was noticed in preventing kidney damage and mitigation of ROS generation, apoptosis, and cellular senescence. Conclusions: The finding establishes the substantial effect of BNB and PCO in countering hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and associated disorders, which synergistically improved following the combined supplementation with BNB+PCO."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A comparative 12-week dietary intervention of red yeast rice (RYR, Beni-koji, Kobayashi, Japan) and Cuban policosanol (PCO, Raydel®, Thornleigh, Australia) was assessed for dyslipidemia, antioxidant status, and vital organ functionality in hyperlipidemic zebrafish. METHODS: Hyperlipidemic zebrafish were supplemented with a high-cholesterol diet (HC, final 4%, w/w) infused with either a powdered RYR tablet (final 1.0%, w/w), a PCO tablet (final 1.0%, w/w), or a combination of 0.5% (w/w) each of RYR and PCO powder for 12 weeks. Subsequently, blood and organs were collected and processed for biochemical and histological examination. RESULTS: RYR and PCO consumption showed a substantial effect against HC-induced hyperlipidemia by reducing the total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Exclusively, PCO supplementation revealed a significant elevation in the HC-diminished high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). In addition, PCO supplementation showed a significant elevation in plasma ferric ion-reducing ability (FRA) and sulfhydryl content, as well as alleviating the blood glucose level of hyperlipidemic zebrafish. The most noteworthy impact, with a significant two-fold (p < 0.001) augmentation of HC-diminished plasma paraoxonase (PON) activity, was observed in response to PCO. In contrast, the RYR supplementation failed to establish curative effects against HC-disturbed plasma antioxidant variables and blood glucose levels. The histological outcome revealed a severe toxicological impact of the RYR on the liver, reflected by fatty liver changes and three-fold heightened IL-6 production compared to HC control. Contrastingly, PCO exhibited significant hepatoprotection and effectively neutralized the hepatic toxicity triggered by HC and RYR. Also, RYR showed kidney atrophy, intense ROS generation, apoptosis, and senescence. Conversely, the PCO supplementation protected the kidney from HC- and RYR-induced toxicity. Likewise, PCO supplementation notably alleviated histological alterations and oxidative stress in the brain, ovary, and testis of hyperlipidemic zebrafish. CONCLUSIONS: This comparative study establishes PCO's therapeutic effect against the challenges posed by HC, while RYR emerged with serious toxicological concerns towards the liver, kidney, and other organs of hyperlipidemic zebrafish."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is a global health concern and reducing plasma LDL-C levels is a major goal in cardiovascular prevention. Our study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a nutraceutical formulation including leucoselect® phytosome®, red yeast rice, policosanol and folic acid on LDL-c levels in patients at low cardiovascular risk with dyslipidemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively enrolled all consecutive patients with dyslipidemia at low cardiovascular risk who were unresponsive to diet and physical activity. Clinical assessments and laboratory analyses, encompassing lipid profile, hepatic function, and CPK levels, were performed at baseline prior to initiating treatment and repeated at the 12-week mark following administration of the study nutraceutical. RESULTS: Sixty (60) consecutive patients (mean age 48.02 ± 10.1 years; 60% male) were included. At the 12-week follow-up, a statistically significant reduction in Total Cholesterol (13.1%) and LDL-c serum level (20.4%) was observed. Hepatic and muscular function remain stable over the time. The adherence to therapy was 99% and the persistence was maximum. CONCLUSIONS: The nutraceutical formulation including leucoselect® phytosome® red yeast rice, policosanol and folic acid significantly reduced the LDL-c plasma levels, consistent with previous research showing that the bioactive component in red yeast rice-lovastatin-is effective in addressing problems with lipid metabolism. Importantly, it was safe and well-tolerated among patients with dyslipidemia in a real-world setting."

      "abstract": "Obesity and overweight, frequently caused by a lack of exercise, are associated with many metabolic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Aerobic exercise effectively increases the high-density lipoproteins-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and alleviates the triglyceride (TG) levels. The consumption of Cuban policosanol (Raydel®) is also effective in enhancing the HDL-C quantity and HDL functionality to treat dyslipidemia and hypertension. On the other hand, no study has examined the effects of a combination of high-intensity exercise and policosanol consumption in obese subjects to improve metabolic disorders. In the current study, 17 obese subjects (average BMI 30.1 ± 1.1 kg/m2, eight male and nine female) were recruited to participate in a program combining exercise and policosanol (20 mg) consumption for 12 weeks. After completion, their BMI, waist circumference, total fat mass, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) reduced significantly up to around -15%, -13%, -33%, -11%, and -13%, respectively. In the serum lipid profile, at Week 12, a significant reduction was observed in the total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels, up to -17% and -54% from the baseline, respectively. The serum HDL-C was elevated by approximately +12% from the baseline, as well as the percentage of HDL-C in TC, and HDL-C/TC (%), was enhanced by up to +32% at Week 12. The serum coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) level was increased 1.2-fold from the baseline in all participants at Week 12. In particular, the male participants exhibited a 1.4-fold increase from the baseline. The larger rise in serum CoQ10 was correlated with the larger increase in the serum HDL-C (r = 0.621, p = 0.018). The hepatic function parameters were improved; the serum γ-glutamyl transferase decreased at Week 12 by up to -55% (p < 0.007), while the aspartate aminotransferase and alanine transaminase levels diminished within the normal range. In the lipoprotein level, the extent of oxidation and glycation were reduced significantly with the reduction in TG content. The antioxidant abilities of HDL, such as paraoxonase (PON) and ferric ion reduction ability (FRA), were enhanced significantly by up to 1.8-fold and 1.6-fold at Week 12. The particle size and number of HDL were elevated up to +10% during the 12 weeks, with a remarkable decline in the TG content, glycation extent, and oxidation. The improvements in HDL quality and functionality were linked to the higher survivability of adult zebrafish and their embryos, under the co-presence of carboxymethyllysine (CML), a pro-inflammatory molecule known to cause acute death. In conclusion, 12 weeks of Cuban policosanol (Raydel®, 20 mg) consumption with high-intensity exercise displayed a significant improvement in blood pressure, body fat mass, blood lipid profile without liver damage, CoQ10 metabolism, and renal impairment."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The process of vascular calcification has severe clinical consequences in a number of diseases, including diabetes, atherosclerosis, and end-stage renal disease. In the present study, we investigated the effect of policosanol (Poli), genistein (Gen), and vitamin D (VitD) separately and in association to evaluate the possible synergistic action on inorganic phosphate (Pi)-induced calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). METHODS: Primary human VSMCs were cultured with either growth medium or growth medium supplemented with calcium and phosphorus (calcification medium) in combination with Poli, Gen, and VitD. Alizarin Red staining, mineralization, and the protein expression of RUNX2 and superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD2) were investigated. RESULTS: All three substances tested were effective at reducing osteogenic differentiation of VSMCs in a dose-dependent manner. Poli+Gen, Poli+VitD, Gen+VitD treatment induced a greater inhibition of calcification and RUNX2 expression compared to single compounds treatments. Moreover, the association of Poli+Gen+VitD (Reduplaxin®) was more effective at inhibiting VSMCs mineralization and preventing the increase in RUNX2 expression induced by calcification medium but not modified SOD2 expression. CONCLUSIONS: The association of Pol, Gen, and VitD (Reduplaxin®) has an additive inhibitory effect on the calcification process of VSMCs induced in vitro by a pro-calcifying medium.",

      "abstract": "The current study compared three policosanols from Cuba (sugarcane, Raydel®, policosanol (1), China (rice bran, Shaanxi, policosanol (2), and the USA (sugarcane, Lesstanol®, policosanol (3) in the treatment of dyslipidemia and protection of the liver, ovary, and testis in hypercholesterolemic zebrafish. After twelve weeks of supplementation of each policosanol (PCO, final 0.1% in diet, w/w) with a high cholesterol diet (HCD, final 4%, w/w), the Raydel policosanol (PCO1) group showed the highest survivability, approximately 89%. In contrast, Shaanxi policosanol (PCO2) and Lesstanol policosanol (PCO3) produced 73% and 87% survivability, respectively, while the HCD alone group showed 75% survivability. In the 12th week, the PCO1 group demonstrated the most modest increase in body weight along with significantly lower levels of total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) in comparison to the HCD control group. Additionally, the PCO1 group exhibited the highest proportion of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol within TC. Notably, the PCO1 group displayed the lowest level of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, minimal infiltration of inflammatory cells, reduced interleukin (IL)-6 production in the liver, a notable decline in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitigated fatty liver changes. HCD supplementation induced impairment of kidney morphology with the greatest extent of ROS production and apoptosis. On the other hand, the PCO 1 group showed a remarkably improved morphology with the least ROS generation and apoptosis. Within the ovarian context, the PCO1 group exhibited the most substantial presence of mature vitellogenic oocytes, accompanied by minimal levels of ROS and apoptosis. Similarly, in the testicular domain, the PCO1 group showcased optimal morphology for spermatogenesis, characterized by the least interstitial area and diminished production of ROS in testicular cells. At week 8, the PCO1 group showed the highest egg-laying ability, with around 244 eggs produced per mating. In contrast, the HCD alone, PCO2, and PCO3 groups showed significantly lower egg-laying ability (49, 59, and 86 eggs, respectively). The embryos from the PCO1 group exhibited the highest survivability with the fastest swimming ability and developmental speed. These results suggest that PCO1 consumption significantly enhanced the reproduction system, egg-laying ability, and embryo survivability. In conclusion, among the three policosanols, Cuban (Raydel®) policosanol had the strongest effect on survivability, improving dyslipidemia, liver protection, kidney, ovary, and testis with a restoration of the cell morphology, and the least ROS production and apoptosis-induced by HCD supplementation."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Policosanol is a mixture of long chain alcohols refined from sugar cane. Significant reductions in liver enzymes have been observed in some studies. However, the impact of policosanol on liver enzymes remained controversial. The current meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effect of policosanol supplementation on the levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST). METHODS: The literature was systematically searched for studies published up to November 2023 in PubMed/Medline, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and Scopus. Randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies were included to evaluate the intervention effect of policosanol compared to placebo on ALT and AST. DerSimonian and Laird models were used to calculate effect sizes. RESULTS: Twenty-three trials including 2535 participants were included in the study. The combination of effect sizes, regarding the random-effects model, demonstrated significant changes in ALT serum levels after intervention (WMD: -1.48 U/L; 95% CI: -2.33 to -0.64; P = 0.001), and AST (WMD: -1.10 U/L; 95% CI: -1.70 to -0.51; P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis of AST and ALT showed that this reduction effect was most often observed at the dose of 20 mg/d. The dose-response analysis represented a non-significant non-linear connection between the dosage and duration of policosanol intervention in ALT and AST serum reduction. CONCLUSION: Policosanol supplementation exerts a beneficial effect on liver enzymes as well as ALT and AST concentrations in adults. However, further long-term and well-designed RCTs with better quality are needed to further assess and confirm these results.",

Policosanol can lower blood pressure or inhibit adipogenesis, but its effect on osteogenic differentiation and the molecular mechanism is unclear. This study aims to investigate the effect of policosanol on osteogenic differentiation in MC3T3-E1 cells and zebrafish models. Administration of policosanol into MC3T3-E1 induced the expression of the osteogenic genes such as distal-less homeobox 5 (Dlx5) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2). Alkaline phosphatase activity and extracellular mineralization also increased. Policosanol promoted activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and insulin-induced genes (INSIGs) expression and regulation of INSIGs modulated osteoblast differentiation. AMPK activation through transfection of the constitutively active form of AMPK (CA-AMPK) increased INSIGs expression, whereas policosanol-induced INSIGs expression was suppressed by inhibitor of AMPK (Com. C). Furthermore, the osteogenic effects of policosanol were verified in zebrafish. Amputated caudal fin rays were regenerated by policosanol treatment. Taken together, these results show that policosanol increases osteogenic differentiation and contributes to fin regeneration in zebrafish via AMPK-mediated INSIGs expression, suggesting that policosanol has potential as an osteogenic agent.",

OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to explore the possible protective effects of policosanol (PCO) on spatial cognitive capacity, long-term potentiation (LTP) induction, oxidant/antioxidant status, and Aβ plaques formation in an AD rat model induced by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of Aβ1-40. METHODS: Healthy adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into control, sham (ICV injection of 5 µl phosphate-buffered saline), AG (50 mg/kg; P.O., as PCO vehicle), PCO (50 mg/kg; P.O.), AD model (ICV injection of 5 µl Aβ), AD + AG (50 mg/kg; P.O.), and AD + PCO (50 mg/kg; P.O.). Treatments were performed for eight consecutive weeks. At the end of the treatment course, spatial learning and memory functions, hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) induction, malondialdehyde (MDA), and total thiol group (TTG) levels, as well as the formation of Aβ plaques, were examined. RESULTS: The results showed that injection of Aβ reduced spatial learning and memory abilities in the Barnes maze test, which was accompanied by decreases in field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) slope, population spike (PS) amplitude, and TTG level and increases in Aβ plaque accumulation and MDA content. In contrast, PCO treatment improved all the above-mentioned changes in the Aβ-infused rats. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that amelioration of hippocampal synaptic plasticity impairment, modulation of oxidant/antioxidant status, and inhibition of Aβ plaque formation by PCO may be the mechanisms behind its protective effect against AD-associated spatial cognitive decline.",

During the ninth and tenth weeks of the study, the cognitive function of the rats was assessed by commonly used behavioral paradigms. Subsequently, oxidative-antioxidative status was examined in the serum. Moreover, compact Aβ plaques were detected by Congo red staining. The results showed that injection of Aβ impaired recognition memory in the novel object recognition test, reduced the spatial cognitive ability in the Morris water maze, and alleviated retention and recall capability in the passive avoidance task. Additionally, injection of Aβ resulted in increased total oxidant status, decreased total antioxidant capacity, and enhanced Aβ plaque formation in the rats. Intriguingly, PCO treatment improved all the above-mentioned neuropathological changes in the Aβ-induced AD rats. The results suggest that PCO improves Aβ-induced cognitive decline, possibly through modulation of oxidative-antioxidative status and inhibition of Aβ plaque formation.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. The standard treatments for PD focus on symptom relief rather than attempting to address the underlying degenerative processes completely. This study aimed to evaluate the potential therapeutic effects of policosanol derived from insect wax (PIW) by investigating improvements in disease symptoms represented in Caenorhabditis elegans models of PD. For our assessments, we used the following three models: NL5901, which is a transgenic model for α-synuclein aggregation; wild-type N2 induced with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA); and 6-OHDA-induced BZ555 as a model for loss of dopaminergic neurons (DNs). Specifically, we examined the effects of PIW treatment on α-synuclein aggregation, the loss of DNs, lipid abundance, and the lifespan of treated organisms. Further, we examined treatment-related changes in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and superoxide dismutase (SOD), as well as the mRNA production profiles of relevant genes. A 10 µg/mL dose of PIW reduced the aggregation of α-synuclein in NL5901 and suppressed the loss of DNs in 6-OHDA-induced BZ555. Overall, PIW treatment decreased ROS and MDA levels, restored lipid abundance, and prolonged the lifespans of worms in all the three models, which may be associated with changes in the expression profiles of genes related to cell survival and oxidative stress response pathways. Our findings show that PIW alleviated the symptoms of PD in these models, possibly by regulating the stress responses initiated by injuries such as α-synuclein aggregation or 6-OHDA treatment.",

Epidemiological studies have shown that regular consumption of phenols is inversely associated with cardiovascular disease, and the use of nutraceuticals and functional foods can provide protective, preventive, and possibly curative effects in CVD. A novel mixture of different natural substances named Recapsoma® (bergamot, liposomal berberine, Ipomoea batatas, oleuropein, polycosanols, and vitamin E) has been produced, and its anti-dyslipidaemic efficacy has been tested, specifically studying the in vitro effects on the mechanisms of action underlying cholesterol synthesis, triglycerides, and LDL-cholesterol oxidation. The work has demonstrated the ability of this herbal extract mixture to inhibit the action of PCSK, ACAT, PAP, and HMGR and to increase the LDL receptor (LDLR), underlying the synergistic effect of the mixture over the single components. Such results suggest that the Recapsoma® mixture could be used as a tool for controlling hypercholesterolemia, and an alternative to statins, especially for those patients with metabolic syndrome."

      "abstract": "Liver fibrosis is a prevalent liver disease that requires rapid and effective treatment prior to its progression to cirrhosis and liver damage. Recently, several reports have investigated the efficacy of phytotherapy using natural herbal extracts rather than synthetic drugs to treat several liver diseases. Policosanol is a herbal extract used to treat patients with cardiovascular. However, its therapeutic effect on liver fibrosis is still unknown. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the potential antifibrotic effect of policosanol compared to silymarin and the possible underlying molecular mechanisms. Rats were categorized into four groups; negative control group \"NCG\", the fibrotic group \"FG\", silymarin treated group \"STG\", and policosanol treated group \"PTG\". Serum liver enzymes, oxidative stress markers, angiogenic growth factors, and pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured biochemically. The relative mRNA expressions of liver caspase-3 and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) were assessed. Immunohistochemical staining was carried out using anti- α-SMA, and anti-caspase-3 antibodies. Compared to NCG, the FG group demonstrated a significant decrease in the level of serum liver enzymes \"GSH, TAC, and SDF. Nevertheless, it demonstrateda significant increase in the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines \"Il-6, TNF\"; oxidative stress markers \"NO, MDA\", and angiogenic growth factors \"VEGF and PDGF\" and the expression of α-SMA, and Caspase-3. Interestingly, the values of these measurements were restored to normal levels in the treated groups, particularly the PTG. In conclusion, our data revealed the beneficial effects of co-administration of policosanol or silymarin on the fibrotic liver rat model and thus could be a promising natural therapeutic drug.",

Although a lot of great progress has been made in research and development of AD therapeutics, there is no fundamental cure for this disease yet. This study demonstrated the memory-improving effects of Cuban policosanol (PCO) in 5xFAD mice, which is an animal model of AD. Following 4-months of treatment with PCO in 5xFAD mice, we found that the number of amyloid plaques decreased in the brain compared to the vehicle-treated 5xFAD mice. Long-term PCO treatment in 5xFAD mice resulted in the reduction of gliosis and abnormal inflammatory cytokines level (interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α) in the cortex and hippocampus. Levels of lipid peroxide (4-hydroxynonenal [4-HNE]) and superoxide dismutase (SOD1 and SOD2) levels were also recoverd in the brains of PCO-treated 5xFAD mice. Notably, PCO administration reduced memory deficits in the passive avoidance test, as well as synaptic loss (PSD-95, synaptophysin) in 5xFAD mice. Collectively, we identified the potential effects of PCO as a useful supplement to delay or prevent AD progression by inhibiting the formation of Aβ plaques in the brain."

It can further lower blood pressure and reduce liver inflammation. Policosanol can also affect vascular calcification, however, its molecular mechanisms are not well understood. This study investigated the effect of policosanol on vascular calcification and its molecular mechanism. Policosanol decreased the expression of inorganic phosphate (Pi)-induced osteogenic genes such as distal-less homeobox 5 (Dlx5) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2). In addition, following policosanol treatment, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation increased in a time-dependent manner. The constitutively active form of AMPK (CA-AMPK) dramatically suppressed Pi-induced Dlx5 and Runx2 protein levels. Inactivation of AMPK using compound C (Com. C; AMPK inhibitor) recovered policosanol-suppressed Alizarin Red S staining levels. Insulin-induced genes (INSIGs) were induced by CA-AMPK, their overexpression suppressed Pi-induced Dlx5 and Runx2 expression. Taken together, the results demonstrate that policosanol inhibits Pi-induced vascular calcification by regulating AMPK-induced INSIG expression in vascular smooth muscle cells.",

The effects of raw and encapsulated policosanol were compared with positive (L-carnitine) and negative (no supplementation) controls on outcomes of complete blood count, serum biochemistry, energy expenditure, respiratory quotient and physical activity in healthy young adult cats. METHODS: The study was a replicated 4 × 4 complete Latin square design. Eight cats (four castrated males, four spayed females; mean age 3.0 ± 1.0 years; mean weight 4.36 ± 1.08 kg; mean body condition score 5.4 ± 1.4) were blocked by sex and body weight then randomized to treatment groups: raw policosanol (10 mg/kg body weight), encapsulated policosanol (50 mg/kg body weight), L-carnitine (200 mg/kg body weight) or no supplementation. Treatments were supplemented to a basal diet for 28 days with a 1-week washout between periods. Food was distributed equally between two offerings to ensure complete supplement consumption (first offering) and measure consumption time (second offering). Blood collection (lipid profile, complete blood count, serum biochemistry) and indirect calorimetry (energy expenditure, respiratory quotient) were conducted at days 0, 14 and 28 of each period. Activity monitors were worn 7 days prior to indirect calorimetry and blood collection. Data were analyzed using a repeated measures mixed model (SAS, v.9.4). RESULTS: Food intake and body weight were similar among treatments. There was no effect of treatment on lipid profile, serum biochemistry, activity, energy expenditure or respiratory quotient (P >0.05); however, time to consume a second meal was greatest in cats fed raw policosanol (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These data suggest that policosanol is safe for feline consumption. Further studies with cats demonstrating cardiometabolic risk factors are warranted to confirm whether policosanol therapy is an efficacious treatment for hyperlipidemia and obesity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), an age-related neurodegenerative disorder and a serious public health concern, is mainly caused by β-amyloid (Aβ)-induced toxicity. Currently, a limited number of drugs are effective against AD, and only a few are used for its treatment. According to traditional Chinese medicine, white wax is mainly composed of policosanol, hexacosanol, and octacosanol. Policosanol has been shown to reduce lipid levels in blood and alleviate the symptoms associated with diabetic complications and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and AD. However, the efficacy of policosanol depends on the purity and composition of the preparation, and the therapeutic efficacy of policosanol derived from insect wax (PIW) in AD is unknown. METHODS: Here, we identified the main components of PIW and investigated the effects of PIW on Aβ-induced toxicity and life-span in a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans model of AD, CL4176. Furthermore, we estimated the expression of amyloid precursor-like protein (apl-1) and the genes involved in various pathways associated with longevity and alleviation of AD-related symptoms in PIW-fed CL4176. RESULTS: PIW mainly consists of tetracosanol, hexacosanol, octacosanol, and triacontanol; it could decrease the Aβ-induced paralysis rate from 86.87 to 66.97% (P < 0.01) and extend the life-span from 6.2 d to 7.8 d (P < 0.001) in CL4176 worms. Furthermore, PIW downregulated apl-1, a gene known to be associated with the levels of Aβ deposits in C. elegans. Additionally, our results showed that PIW modulated the expression of genes associated with longevity-related pathways such as heat shock response, anti-oxidative stress, and glutamine cysteine synthetase. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that PIW may be a potential therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of AD. However, its effects on murine models and patients with AD need to be explored further.",

      "abstract": "Previously, we have demonstrated that policosanol from Chinese wax suppressed testosterone(T)-induced alopecia in mice. However, the underlying mechanism remained to be determined. Herein, we investigated the mechanism of policosanol against androgenetic alopecia (AGA). AGA was induced in Kunming mice by subcutaneous administration of testosterone propionate for 60 d. Policosanol (0.5 %, 1% or 2%) was applied topically on the back of mice. Finasteride (2%) was applied topically as a positive control. The serum T and estradiol (E2) concentrations were determined by ELISA after 28 and 60 days of treatment. The cutaneous expression or activity of key mediators of hair growth, such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and epidermal growth factor (EGF), was measured. MTS assay was performed to evaluate cell proliferation in cultured human dermal papilla cells (DPCs) treated with dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Western blotting was performed to evaluate the protein expression of Bax, Bcl2, TGF-β2, caspase-9, and caspase-3. We found lower T and T/E2 ratio in mice treated with policosanol than in the model group. Policosanol suppressed premature hair follicle entry into the regression phase, as shown by improving VEGF and EGF expression and ALP activity. The MTS assay showed that policosanol markedly inhibited the apoptosis of DHT-treated DPCs. Western blotting showed that policosanol significantly reduced the protein expression of TGF-β2, cleaved caspese-9, cleaved caspase-3, and Bax, and increased that of Bcl2. The optimal effect was obtained with 12.50 g/mL policosanol. In conclusion, policosanol prevents androgenetic alopecia by regulating hormone levels and suppressing premature hair follicle entry into the regression phase.",

They were randomly divided into four groups, as follows: 20 mg policosanol (group A, n = 64); 10 mg policosanol (group B, n = 72); 20 mg atorvastatin (group C, n = 91); and 10 mg policosanol + 20 mg atorvastatin (group D, n = 62). Plasma platelet count, platelet aggregation rate, circulating endothelial cell (CEC) count, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) were measured before the study (week 0) and at weeks 12, 24, and 52. RESULTS: In group A, the platelet aggregation rate caused by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) after treatment was significantly decreased compared with before treatment (48.79% ± 20.29% vs. 40.37% ± 23.56%), but the arachidonic acid (AA)-induced platelet aggregation rates were similar. The platelet aggregation rates induced by AA and ADP in groups B, C, and D did not change significantly. CEC counts and hs-CRP and homocysteine levels in all groups after treatment were significantly lower compared with before treatment, but carotid IMTs were similar. CONCLUSION: Policosanol regulates blood lipid levels and improves endothelial cell function, and it could delay the progress of atherosclerosis.Trial registration number: ChiCTR-RRC-17013396 (retrospectively registered).",

      "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is an attractive therapeutic target for treating obesity and metabolic diseases. Octacosanol is the main component of policosanol, a mixture of very long chain aliphatic alcohols obtained from plants. The current study aimed to investigate the effect of octacosanol and policosanol on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Mice were fed on chow, or HFD, with or without octacosanol or policosanol treatment for four weeks. HFD-fed mice showed significantly higher body weight and body fat compared with chow-fed mice. However, mice fed on HFD treated with octacosanol or policosanol (HFDo/p) showed lower body weight gain, body fat gain, insulin resistance and hepatic lipid content. Lower body fat gain after octacosanol or policosanol was associated with increased BAT activity, reduced expression of genes involved in lipogenesis and cholesterol uptake in the liver, and amelioration of white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammation. Moreover, octacosanol and policosanol significantly increased the expression of Ffar4, a gene encoding polyunsaturated fatty acid receptor, which activates BAT thermogenesis. Together, these results suggest that octacosanol and policosanol ameliorate diet-induced obesity and metabolic disorders by increasing BAT activity and improving hepatic lipid metabolism. Thus, these lipids represent promising therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of obesity and obesity-related metabolic disorders.",

AIM: To analyze the policosanol treatment effects in the hypertensive patients included in two non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke recovery trials. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Hypertensive patients with a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 2 to 4 were randomized, within 30 days of onset, to policosanol + aspirin or placebo + aspirin, for six months. The primary outcome was mRS score reduction. RESULTS: One hundred forty two hypertensive patients (mean age: 66 years) were included in the analysis. Policosanol + aspirin decreased significantly the mRS score mean from the first interim check-up. The policosanol treatment effect did not wear off, on the contrary, even improved after six months therapy. More over, policosanol + aspirin (80.3%) treatment achieved significant results (mRS <= 1), whereas the placebo + aspirin did not (8.5%). Two patients discontinued and four (two from each group) referred mild adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment for six months with policosanol + aspirin in hypertensive patients who had suffered a non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke proved to be more effective than the placebo + aspirin treatment in the functional recovery of these patients.",

This controlled, randomized clinical trial was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of fenofibrate, policosanol and a combination of these 2 in lowering low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in elderly patients with mixed dyslipidemia. METHODS: A total of 102 patients aged ≥60years were randomly assigned into 3 groups: patients receiving a 24-week therapy of fenofibrate (200 mg/day), policosanol (20 mg/day) or fenofibrate + policosanol combination. Lipids were evaluated at baseline, after 16 and after 24 weeks of therapy. Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (ba-PWV) was performed, and SF-36 questionnaires were used to evaluate the patients' quality of life. The primary endpoint was the percentage reduction in LDL-C. The secondary end points included percentage change in nonhigh density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride, high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), ba-PWV and SF-36 scores. Safety was assessed by adverse events and laboratory parameters. RESULTS: LDL-C, non-HDL-C and TC were decreased, respectively after treatment with policosanol for 24 weeks (P < 0.01). Treatment with policosanol + fenofibrate resulted in significantly greater reductions in TC, non-HDL-C and LDL-C compared to fenofibrate alone (P < 0.01, respectively). There were significant increases in SF-36 scores in the policosanol and policosanol + fenofibrate groups (P < 0.05), and significant improvements of ba-PWV in the 2 groups (P < 0.01). There were no serious adverse events or significant changes in laboratory variables after any of the treatment regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Policosanol + fenofibrate combination therapy significantly improved lipid parameters, arterial stiffness, and quality of life, with good tolerability.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the long-term effects of policosanol supplementation on blood pressure (BP) and the lipid profile in healthy Korean participants with pre-hypertension (systolic 120-139 mmHg, diastolic 85-89 mmHg). This randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled trial included 84 healthy participants who were randomly assigned to three groups receiving 10 mg of policosanol, 20 mg of policosanol, or placebo for 24 weeks. The BP, lipid profile, and anthropometric factors were measured pre- and post-intervention and then compared. Based on an average of three measurements of brachial BP, the policosanol 20 mg group showed the most significant reduction in average systolic BP (SBP) from 138 ± 12 mmHg at week 0 to 126 ± 13 mmHg at week 24 (p < 0.0001). The policosanol 20 mg group also showed significant reductions in aortic SBP and DBP up to 9% (p = 0.00057) and 8% (p = 0.004), respectively compared with week 0. Additionally, blood renin and aldosterone levels were significantly reduced in the policosanol 20 mg group up to 63% (p < 0.01) and 42% (p < 0.05), respectively, at week 24. For the blood lipid profile, the policosanol 10 mg and 20 mg groups showed significant reductions in total cholesterol (TC) of around 8% (p = 0.029) and 13% (p = 0.0004), respectively, at week 24 compared with week 0. Serum HDL-C level significantly increased up to 16% and 12% in the policosanol 10 mg (p = 0.002) and 20 mg (p = 0.035) group, respectively. The study results suggest that long-term policosanol consumption simultaneously reduces peripheral BP as well as aortic BP accompanied by elevation of HDL-C and % HDL-C in TC in a dose-dependent manner."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several anti-arthritic drugs and synthetic antioxidants have wide pharmaceutical uses and are often associated with various side effects on the human health. Dietary seed oils and their minor components like policosanol may offer an effective alternative treatment for arthritic and oxidative-stress related diseases. The biological effects of seed oils were affected by different parameters such as the stage of seed maturity. Hence, this study seeks to determine the policosanol content, antioxidant and anti-arthritic activities of milk thistle (Silybium marianum L.) oil extracted at various stages of seed maturation. METHODS: Milk thistle oil samples were extracted from seeds collected at three maturation stages (immature, intermediate, and mature). The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethyl-benzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging assays were used to determine the antioxidant activity of the extracted oils. The anti-arthritic activity of oil samples was evaluated with bovine serum protein denaturation and egg albumin denaturation methods. Gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was employed to determine the policosanol profile. RESULTS: Policosanol profile, antioxidant and anti-arthritic activities of milk thistle oil were influenced by the seed maturity stages. The oil extracted from the immature seeds had the highest total policosanol content (987.68 mg/kg of oil) and displayed the maximum antiradical activity (96.42% and 90.35% for DPPH test and ABTS assay, respectively). Nine aliphatic alcohols were identified in the milk thistle oil. The dominant poliosanol in the mature seed oil was octacosanol (75.44%), while triacontanol was the major compound (40.25%) in the immature seed oil. Additionally, the maximum inhibition of bovine serum protein denaturation (92.53%) and egg albumin denaturation (86.36%) were observed in immature seed oil as compared to mature seed oil. A high correlation was found between the total policosanol content, anti-arthritic activity and antioxidant capacity of oil. CONCLUSIONS: The milk thistle oil exhibited a potential anti-arthritic and antioxidant activities and that it might contribute to the protection of humans from a variety of diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. Also, it could serve as natural antioxidant and anti-arthritic agents for application in the food industries and pharmaceutic. Policosanol level in the seed oils might contribute to their anti-arthritic and antioxidant activities.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 11 databases including the PubMed, Web of science, Embase, Scopus, the Cochrane library and SinoMed databases were searched for available studies investigating the effects of policosanol on dyslipidemia. A total of 22 studies including 1886 subjects were included in the analysis. The pooled results showed that compared with placebo, sugarcane policosanol could significantly reduce total cholesterol (TC, 95% CI: -0.87 to -0.30 mmol/L) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c, 95% CI: -1.02 to -0.40 mmol/L) and increase high density lipoprotein cholesterol; however, no significant effects were observed on triglyceride (TG) and body weight. Subgroup analysis suggested the studies from Cuba obtained more effective data than those outside this country, and the effects were not proportional to the dose. The adverse effects analysis demonstrated that sugarcane policosanol was safer than the control agents. CONCLUSION: The pooled results supported the lipid-lowering effects and safety of policosanol. Because of the high heterogeneity, the better treatment effects observed in the Cuban studies and the inconsistent dose-response relationship, more clinical trials are needed to further confirm the efficacy of policosanol on dyslipidemia.",

However there has been no reporter WW and its extract responsible for hair growth-promoting effect on androgenetic alopecia. In this paper, we examined the hair growth-promoting effects of WW and policosanol of white wax (WWP) on model animal of androgenetic alopecia and the potential target cell of WW and WWP. WW (1, 10 and 20%) and WWP (0.5, 1 and 2%) were applied topically to the backs of mice. Finasteride (2%) was applied topically as a positive control. MTS assays were performed to evaluate cell proliferation in culture human follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPCs). The inhibition of WW and WWP for 5α- reductase were tested in Vitro. Results showed more lost hairs were clearly seen in mice treated with TP only and TP plus vehicle. Mice which received TP plus WW and WWP showed less hair loss. WW and WWP showed an outstanding hair growth-promoting activity as reflected by the follicular length, follicular density, A/T ratio, and hair bulb diameter. The optimal treatment effect was observed at 10% WW and 1% WWP, which were better than 2% finasteride treatment. MTS assay results suggested that WW and WWP remarkably increased the proliferation of HFDPCs. Inhibitor assay of 5α- reductase showed that WW and WWP inhibited significantly the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotesterone, and the IC50 values of WW and WWP were higher than that of finasteride. In Conclusion, WW and WWP could act against testosterone-induced alopecia in mice, and they promoted hair growth by inhibiting 5α-reductase activity and HFDPCs proliferation. DPCs is the target cell of WW and WWP.",

Influence of sugarcane policosanol extract on platelet was reported but little was known of rice bran policosanol, particularly its mechanisms of actions on platelet activities. Objective. Antiplatelet mechanisms of rice bran policosanol extract (RBE) were studied using hyperlipidemic Sprague Dawley rats. Ex vivo platelet aggregation, platelet count (PC), bleeding time (BT), and coagulation time were assayed. Serum eicosanoids and other aggregation-related metabolites levels were quantified. Design. Rats were divided into 6 groups for comparisons (vehicle control Tween 20/H2O, high dose policosanol 500 mg/kg, middle dose policosanol 250 mg/kg, low dose policosanol 100 mg/kg, and positive control aspirin 30 mg/kg). Results. Low dose 100 mg/kg of RBE inhibited aggregation by 42.32 ± 4.31% and this was comparable with the effect of 30 mg/kg aspirin, 43.91 ± 5.27%. Results showed that there were no significant differences in PC, BT, and coagulation time among various groups after RBE treatment. Serum thromboxane A2 was attenuated while prostacyclin level increased upon RBE treatment. Conclusions. RBE reduced ex vivo ADP-induced platelet aggregation without giving adverse effects. No changes in full blood count suggested that rice bran policosanol did not disturb biological blood cell production and destruction yet it reduced aggregation through different mechanisms."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rice bran is bioactive-rich and has proven health benefits for humans. Moreover, its source, the brown rice has antioxidant, hypolipidemic and other functional properties that are increasingly making it a nutritional staple especially in Asian countries. This study investigated the antiplatelet aggregation mechanisms of crude hexane/methanolic rice bran extract, in which policosanol was the targeted bioactive. Platelets play a vital role in pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases, and their increased activities could potentially cause arterial thrombus formation or severe bleeding disorders. Thus, in this study, platelet aggregation and adhesion of platelets to major components of basal lamina were examined in vitro. In addition, cellular protein secretion was quantified as a measurement of platelet activation. METHODS: Adenosine diphosphate (ADP), collagen, and arachidonic acid (AA)-induced aggregation were studied using the microtiter technique. Rat platelets were pre-treated with various concentrations of policosanol extract, and the adhesion of platelets onto collagen- and laminin-coated surface (extracellular matrix) was studied using the acid phosphatase assay. The effect of crude policosanol extract on released proteins from activated platelets was measured using modified Lowry determination method. RESULTS: Rice bran policosanol extract significantly inhibited in vitro platelet aggregation induced by different agonists in a dose dependent manner. The IC50 of ADP-, collagen-, and AA-induced platelet aggregation were 533.37 ± 112.16, 635.94 ± 78.45 and 693.86 ± 70.57 μg/mL, respectively. The present study showed that crude rice bran policosanol extract significantly inhibited platelet adhesion to collagen in a dose dependent manner. Conversely, at a low concentration of 15.625 μg/mL, the extract significantly inhibited platelet adhesion to laminin stimulated by different platelet agonists. In addition to the alteration of cell adhesive properties, cellular protein secretion of the treated platelets towards different stimulants were decreased upon crude extract treatment. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that crude rice bran policosanol extract could inhibit in vitro platelet adhesion, aggregation and secretion upon activation using agonists. These findings serve as a scientific platform to further explore alternative therapies in cardiovascular diseases related to platelet malfunction.",

      "abstract": "This work mainly aimed to investigate the probable changes of aortic calcification by policosanol, omega-3 fatty acids in comparison with atorvastatin and subsequent progression of atherosclerosis in diabetic hyperlipemic rat model. Adult male albino rats of wistar strain (30) were divided into five groups (n = 6/group); one was fed normal diet and was used as a normal group, the other groups received alloxan, atherogenic diet (CCT - rat chow diet supplemented with 4% cholesterol, 1% cholic acid, and 0.5% thiouracil) and categorized as follows: the second group received no treatment and kept as control (diabetic hyperlipidemic control group (DHC)). The other groups received daily oral doses of atorvastatin, policosanol (10 mg/kg body weight) and ω-3 (50 mg/kg body weight), respectively, for eight weeks. Different biomarkers were used for the evaluation that included inflammatory (C reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)), oxidative stress (glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA)) bone calcification markers (alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Vitamin D, parathyroid hormone (PTH)), lipogram pattern in addition to histochemical demonstration of calcium in the aorta. Diabetic hyperlipemic group demonstrated significant hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and increased inflammation, oxidative stress, calcification, and finally atherogenesis progression. Treatment of diabetic hyperlipemic rats with, policosanol, omega-3 fatty acids (natural products) and atorvastatin for eight weeks significantly increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), Vitamin D, decreased aortic vacuoles number, and inhibited calcification process. Policosanol induced more remarkable reduction in the density and number of foam cells and improved the intimal lesions of the aorta as compared to atorvastatin. Drugs under study exerted hypoglycemic effect along with an inhibition of inflammation, oxidative stress, and calcium deposition with certain variations but policosanol effect was remarkable in comparison with other drugs.",

The present study examined (i) the effect of policosanol supplementation on blood cholesterol and glucose levels and (ii) changes in hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis using 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) activity in Wistar rats fed high cholesterol diets. The Wistar rats were assigned randomly to high-cholesterol diets (1.25% cholesterol) with or without policosanol (8.0 mg/kg body weight) for 6 weeks. Compared with the control group, dietary treatment with policosanol resulted in a significant decrease of blood cholesterol (p<0.01), blood glucose (p<0.01), triglyceride (p<0.001), and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels (p<0.01) and HMG-CoA reductase activity (p<0.001) in the liver. These results indicate that policosanol decreases blood cholesterol levels by suppressing cholesterol biosynthesis via decrease of HMG-CoA activity. Policosanol has the potential to be developed into an effective dietary strategy for both postprandial hyperglycemia and hypercholesterolemia."

BACKGROUND: Certain number of patients has high residual platelet reactivity on clopidogrel after coronary intervention, and their risk of thrombotic events is high. METHOD: In this prospective, randomized trial conducted in four Chinese sites, 350 patients with high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HPR, defined as platelet aggregation >65%) were randomized by the ratio of 1:3:3 to: group A, clopidogrel 75 mg/d for 1 year (n=50); group B, clopidogrel 150 mg/d for 30 days followed by 75 mg/d until 1 year (n=150); or group C, policosanol 40 mg/d for 6 month and clopidogrel 75 mg/d for 1 year (n=150). All of them were treated with aspirin. The primary endpoint was the reversion rate of HPR at 1 month (reversion was defined as platelet aggregation <65%). The secondary endpoints were 6-month major adverse cardiac events (MACE), which included cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or ischemic symptoms driven target vessel revascularization. RESULTS: At 30 days, the reversion rate of HPR was 34.0%, 55.2%, and 48.7% in group A, group B, and group C, respectively (P=.029). Major adverse cardiac events occurred in 4 (8.0%), 6(4.0%), and 5(3.3%) patients (P=.342). There was 1 (0.7%) major bleeding and 1 (0.7%) minor bleeding event in high maintenance dose clopidogrel group, no major or moderate bleeding in the other two groups. The minimal bleeding in group B was significantly higher than group C (10.7% vs 2.7%, P=.022). At 2-year follow-up, the benefits of policosanol on bleedings persisted compared with group B. CONCLUSIONS: Policosanol reduced platelet reactivity to a similar extent as high maintenance dose of clopidogrel without increasing bleeding rate.",

      "abstract": "Consumption of policosanol (PCO), a refined mixture of sugar cane wax alcohols, can elevate serum levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), although the molecular mechanism is still unknown. To investigate the mechanism of action responsible for the anti-senescence effects of PCO on lipoprotein metabolism and HDL functionality, we synthesized reconstituted HDL (rHDL) containing PCO. Encapsulation of PCO by rHDL (PCO-rHDL) enhanced anti-oxidant activity against cupric ion-mediated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation. PCO-rHDL (final concentration, 9 μM PCO) showed more potent anti-oxidant activity than vitamin C treatment (final concentration, 100 μM). PCO-rHDL inhibited fructose-mediated glycation, which is a major pathological mechanism of diabetic complications, in a dose-dependent manner. PCO also showed cytoprotective effects in monocytes and macrophages with less triggering of apoptotic processes and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). PCO-rHDL strongly inhibited uptake of acetylated LDL into macrophages, which is an initial atherosclerotic process. Surprisingly, PCO-rHDL inhibited human serum cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity by up to 47% (final concentration, 10 μM PCO). Subcutaneous injection of PCO-rHDL dose-dependently enhanced tissue regeneration activity by 2.4-fold and 3.6-fold compared to that of the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) control. In conclusion, PCO in HDL showed potent anti-oxidant, anti-glycation, and CETP inhibitory activities along with tissue regenerative activity, especially upon incorporation into HDL. These results suggest that PCO can enhance functionality of HDL in serum to exert anti-senescence and longevity effects.",

The precipitates obtained by centrifuging the dispersion (5,000 × g, 30 min) contained crystalline V-amylose complex of policosanol. The supernatant also contained policosanol but not in the complex form. Stepwise addition of policosanol and longer time complex formation increased the dispersible policosanol: about 95% by 30 min interval, 1.0% dextrin solution and 12h complex formation time. Among the dispersible policosanol (95%), 70% policosanol resided in the precipitates and 25% was in the supernatant, indicating the dextrin behaved as a stabilizer for the dispersed policosanol as well as a complex forming agent with policosanol.

Protocol II: 15 healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to either policosanol 20 mg/d or a control group for 12 weeks. Serum levels of PCSK9 were determined at day 0 and the end of each protocol. Results. Protocol I: atorvastatin 20 mg/d significantly increased serum PCSK9 level by 39.4% (256 ± 84 ng/mL versus 357 ± 101 ng/mL, P = 0.002). However, policosanol 20 mg/d + atorvastatin 20 mg/d increased serum PCSK9 level by only 17.4% without statistical significance (264 ± 60 ng/mL versus 310 ± 86 ng/mL, P = 0.184). Protocol II: there was a trend toward decreasing serum PCSK9 levels in the policosanol group (289 ± 71 ng/mL versus 235 ± 46 ng/mL, P = 0.069). Conclusion. Policosanol combined with statin attenuated the statin-induced increase in serum PCSK9 levels. This finding indicates that policosanol might have a modest effect of lowering serum PCSK9 levels."

Pretreatment with policosanol and atorvastatin has been effective in experimental models of cerebral ischaemia in rodents. The objective was to compare the therapeutic effects of policosanol and atorvastatin in a model of global cerebral ischaemia in gerbils. Gerbils were distributed into seven groups, a negative control and six with ischaemia-reperfusion-induced global cerebral ischemia (one vehicle positive control, two policosanol (100 and 200 mg/kg), two atorvastatin (10 and 20 mg/kg) and one aspirin (60 mg/kg) group). Treatments were given 4 h after ischaemia induction. Effects on ischemia-reperfusion-induced symptoms, hyperlocomotion, damage of pyramidal hipoccampal neurons and increased plasma oxidative markers were investigated. Positive, not negative controls, exhibited clinical symptoms, hyperlocomotion, neuronal damage and increased plasma oxidative markers. Policosanol (100 and 200 mg/kg) reduced significantly ischemia-reperfusion-induced symptoms, the frequency of symptomatic animals, histological scores of neuronal damage and plasma oxidative markers as compared with the positive control group. Atorvastatin (10 and 20 mg/kg) decreased significantly the symptoms and histological scores, but unchanged the frequency of symptomatic gerbils and oxidative variables. Only the highest dose of policosanol (200 mg/kg) and atorvastatin (20 mg/kg) reduced significantly ischemia reperfusion-induced hyperlocomotion, policosanol being the most effective. Aspirin 60 mg/kg lowered significantly symptom score, the rate of symptomatic gerbils and hyperlocomotion versus the positive controls, but failed to modify oxidative parameters. In conclusion, postreperfusion treatment with policosanol and atorvastatin was effective for ameliorating symptoms, hyperlocomotion and neurological damage of hippocampal CA1 neurons in gerbils with ischemia-reperfusion-induced global cerebral ischemia, but only policosanol reduced increased plasma oxidative variables."

METHODS: This randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled study included 120 male patients with hyperlipidemia. Patients were divided randomly into treatment group(n = 60) and control group(n = 60). Patients in the treatment group were administrated with simvastatin (40 mg/d) plus policosanol (20 mg/d),and those in the control group were treated with simvastatin (40 mg/d) plus placebo (20 mg/d). The values of total cholesterol(TC), triglyceride(TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol(LDL-C), testosterone(T) and estradiol (E2) were assessed before and after 16 weeks treatment.Drug-induced adverse effects were observed. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. TC,TG, LDL-C were (5.74 ± 0.99) , (1.62 ± 0.69), (3.60 ± 0.56) mmol/L in the treatment group at baseline and significantly reduced after 16 weeks treatment (4.57 ± 0.58), (1.54 ± 0.55), (2.68 ± 0.38) mmol/L (all P < 0.05). TC, LDL-C were (5.99 ± 0.93) , (3.76 ± 0.42) mmol/L in the control group at baseline and significantly reduced after 16 weeks treatment (5.03 ± 0.59) , (2.98 ± 0.28) mmol/L (all P < 0.05) while TG remained unchanged post 16 weeks therapy in the control group. Simvastatin plus policosanol achieved a significantly greater reduction in LDL-C and TC than simvastatin plus placebo (P < 0.05). HDL-C,T and E2 were similar before and after 16 weeks treatments in both groups (P > 0.05) .The adverse reactions were similar between the two groups, most of them were mild and happened at the beginning of drug therapy and could be well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Simvastatin/policosanol produces greater decreases in TC, LDL-C than simvastatin/placebo without resulting more side effects and changes on sex hormones.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: A low-fat, fiber-rich diet is the first step in the management for hypercholesterolemic children. Glucomannan (GM) is a natural fiber that has been demonstrated to lower total and LDL-cholesterol. The use of high-dose chromium-polynicotinate (CP) and policosanol (PC) has also shown cholesterol-lowering benefits. We aimed at investigating the effects of low-dose CP or PC and their GM combination in hypercholesterolemic children. METHODS: A double-blind trial was conducted in 120 children (60 M, 60 F, 9 ± 4 years, median 9.6 years, range: 3-16 years) randomly assigned to 5 neutraceutical and 1 placebo (only resistant starch) 8-week treatment groups. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), total cholesterol (CholT), triglycerides (TG), HDL and LDL cholesterol were considered. RESULTS: GM combination of low-dose CP or PC reduced CholT and LDL without changing HDL, TG and FBG. The highest post-treatment changes were seen after GM combination with CP (CholT 85 ± 3% and LDL 85 ± 5%, of pretreatment) which was significantly (p < 0.01) less than with low-dose CP or PC and starch. When GM was associated with starch, there was no lipid lowering effect, which was an unexpected finding as compared to previous data with GM and no starch. No adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSION: This is the first report to show the cholesterol-lowering efficacy of GM combined treatment with low-dose CP or PC. Further studies are needed to investigate the best combinations and doses of nutraceutics to be added to the standard GM treatment. The potential negative association of GM and nutraceutics with starch is clearly shown.",

METHODS: This randomized, open study included 72 patients with hyperlipidemia. The patients were randomly assigned to treatment group (policosanol, 20 mg/d, n = 36) or placebo group (placebo, two tablets/d, n = 36). The levels of serum lipids, hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), HO-1 were assessed before and after 16 weeks treatment. Drug-induced adverse effects and events were recorded during the observation period. The serum HO-1 was measured by ELISA. RESULTS: (1) After 16 weeks, all parameters remained unchanged in the placebo group; the level of TC decreased from (7.01 ± 1.03) mmol/L to (5.66 ± 0.83) mmol/L (-19.4%, P < 0.01), the level of LDL-C decreased from (4.78 ± 0.72) mmol/L to (3.70 ± 0.69) mmol/L (-22.5%, P < 0.01) in the treatment group. TG and HDL-C levels remained unchanged (P > 0.05) while the level of HO-1 significantly decreased from (1.82 ± 1.08) µg/L to (1.45 ± 0.81) µg/L (P < 0.01) and the level of hs-CRP decreased from (3.40 ± 3.64) mg/L to (1.86 ± 2.02) mg/L (P < 0.01) in the treatment group. (2) Safety index was similar between placebo and treatment groups (P > 0.05) and there was no adverse events including allergic reaction, muscle pain in all subjects during the observation period. CONCLUSION: The short-term data obtained from this small hyperlipidemia patient cohort suggest that policosanol is a safe lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory agent for hyperlipidemia patients.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Statins are at the forefront of strategies to manage dyslipidemia, although they are not always well tolerated. At 6-7 months after the drug was supplied, discontinuation rates averaged 30%. Alternate agents to statins have been studied. Some nutraceuticals demonstrated an efficacy in reducing cholesterol concentrations. However, there are no data regarding the use of nutraceuticals in elderly dyslipidemic patients. The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a nutraceutical-based protocol in elderly hypercholesterolemic patients previously intolerant to statins. METHODS: This study was performed as a randomized, prospective, parallel group, single-blind study. Patients were included in the study if they had high total cholesterolemia, high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), >75 years of age, statin-intolerant, and were refusing other pharmaceutical treatments for hypercholesterolemia. At the baseline visit, eligible patients were randomized to either nutraceutical-combined pill (containing berberine 500 mg, policosanol 10 mg, red yeast rice 200 mg, folic acid 0.2 mg, coenzyme Q10 2.0 mg, and astaxanthin 0.5 mg) or placebo, and the first dose was dispensed. The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the proposed treatment were fully assessed after 3, 6, and 12 months of treatment. RESULTS: Out of 106 consecutive patients screened, 80 eligible patients were randomized to receive either nutraceutical-combined pill (40 patients) or placebo (40 patients). No patients were lost and no deaths occurred during the follow-up. There was a statistically significant reduction in total cholesterolemia (-20%), LDL-C (-31%), and insulin resistance (-10%) with nutraceutical treatment. No significant changes were detected for plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Furthermore, no statistical differences were found between baseline and end-study safety parameters. Medication compliance and tolerability were high. CONCLUSION: In this study the authors have demonstrated that combined nutraceuticals significantly reduce cholesterolemia and achieved acceptable plasma LDL-C levels in elderly hypercholesterolemic patients who were previously statin-intolerant. Combined nutraceuticals is also safe and well tolerated in these patients.",

Findings from previous trials evaluating the effects of policosanol are mixed with early data reporting positive lipid effects while more recent studies indicate negligible efficacy. We hypothesized that re-formulating policosanol would result in an improvement in major lipoproteins and possibly provide some explanation for previously conflicting trial data. Our primary objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of modified-policosanol (MP) on the major lipoproteins among hyperlipidemic subjects receiving background statin therapy or as monotherapy. This 8-week clinical trial consisted of 3 arms. Subjects receiving chronic statin therapy (N = 36) were randomized in a double-blind design to MP 20 mg daily or placebo. In the third arm, subjects not receiving statin therapy (N = 18) were assigned open-label MP 20 mg daily. The utilization of MP when added to background statin therapy or as monotherapy resulted in no significant changes in major lipoproteins (all p > 0.05). The MP therapy was well tolerated with no major adverse events reported. Consistent with recent clinical trial data, MP demonstrated an excellent safety profile but produced no significant effects on major lipoproteins when used as monotherapy or when given with concomitant statin therapy.",

Policosanol is a dietary supplement derived from sugar cane that is widely used as a statin alternative in Latin America. PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVE: To collect feasibility data on sugar cane-derived policosanol to normalize dyslipidemic profiles in a sample of medically underserved HIV-infected people. METHODS/DESIGN: Randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial. SETTING: Two infectious disease outpatient clinics located in a Health Resources Service Administration-designated medically underserved neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-four clinically stable HIV-infected people (91% black) with at least one lipid abnormality that warranted dietary modifications and/or drug therapy. INTERVENTION: Participants received either 20 mg/day of policosanol or placebo for 12 weeks, followed by a 4-week washout and crossover to the other arm. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Efficacy measures included the standard lipid panel (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-derived lipoprotein particle profiles. Safety measures included CD4+ T lymphocyte counts, plasma HIV ribonucleic acid levels, serum creatinine, and liver function tests. RESULTS: Policosanol supplementation was not associated with normalization of any dyslipidemic parameters as measured by the standard lipid panel or NMR spectroscopy-measured lipoprotein size or concentration. The supplement was well tolerated and was not associated with any changes in parameters of HIV disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings corroborate recent studies conducted outside Cuba that have failed to find any lipid modulatory effects for policosanol.",

The present studies demonstrate that policosanol promotes the phosphorylation of AMP-kinase and HMG-CoA reductase in hepatoma cells and in mouse liver after intragastric administration, providing a possible means by which policosanol might lower blood cholesterol levels. Treatment of hepatoma cells with policosanol produced a 2.5-fold or greater increase in the phosphorylation of AMP-kinase and HMG-CoA reductase, and increased the phosphorylation of Ca(++)/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase (CaMKK), an upstream AMP-kinase kinase. Intragastric administration of policosanol to mice similarly increased the phosphorylation of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase and AMP-kinase by greater than 2-fold. siRNA-mediated suppression of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase, fatty acyl-CoA synthetase 4, and acyl-CoA acetyltransferase expression in hepatoma cells prevented the phosphorylation of AMP-kinase and HMG-CoA reductase by policosanol, indicating that metabolism of these very long chain alcohols to activated fatty acids is necessary for the suppression of cholesterol synthesis, presumably by increasing cellular AMP levels. Subsequent peroxisomal β-oxidation probably augments this effect.",

METHODS: This was an open-label, randomized, three-treatment, cross-over, clinical trial in healthy male subjects (n= 12) of known CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype who received a single oral dose of warfarin alone or after 2 weeks of pre-treatment with each herbal medicine at recommended doses. Pharmacodynamic (INR, platelet activity) and pharmacokinetic (warfarin enantiomer concentrations) end points were evaluated. RESULTS: The apparent clearance of (S)-warfarin (90% CI of ratio; 1.01, 1.18) was significantly higher during concomitant treatment with echinacea but this did not lead to a clinically significant change in INR (90% CI of AUC of INR; 0.91, 1.31). Policosanol did not significantly affect warfarin enantiomer pharmacokinetics or warfarin response. Neither echinacea nor policosanol had a significant effect on platelet aggregation after 2 weeks of pre-treatment with the respective herbal medicines. CONCLUSION: Echinacea significantly reduced plasma concentrations of S-warfarin. However, neither echinacea nor policosanol significantly affected warfarin pharmacodynamics, platelet aggregation or baseline clotting status in healthy subjects.",

Independent research examining changes in cholesterol kinetics in response to SCP is limited to few studies, none of which was able to replicate findings of the original research. Moreover, no data are available on the effect of SCP on cholesterol absorption to date. The present study was undertaken to determine effects on cholesterol kinetics, namely synthesis and absorption, within hypercholesterolemic individuals consuming a SCP treatment. Twenty-one otherwise healthy hypercholesterolemic subjects participated in a randomized double-blind crossover study where they received 10 mg/day of policosanols or a placebo incorporated in margarine as an evening snack for a period of 28 days. The last week of the study phase, subjects were given 13C labelled cholesterol and deuterated water for the measurement of cholesterol absorption and synthesis respectively. Blood was collected on the first two and last five days of the trial. Cholesterol absorption and synthesis were determined by measuring red cell cholesterol 13C and deuterium enrichment, respectively. RESULTS: There was no significant change in LDL cholesterol levels as compared to control. In addition, the area under the curve for red cell cholesterol 13C enrichment across 96 hours was not significantly different in the SCP group as compared to control. Similarly, no difference was observed in the fractional rate of cholesterol synthesis over the period of 24 hours between the two treatment groups. CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study fail to support previous research concerning efficacy and mechanism of action for policosanols.",

Thirty-nine patients were randomized to policosanol or aspirin. Walking distances on a treadmill were assessed before and after treatment. Policosanol significantly increased the initial and absolute claudication distances, while aspirin changed neither variable. Policosanol, not aspirin, significantly lowered serum low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and total cholesterol while raising high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. In conclusion, treatments of policosanol, not aspirin, for 10 weeks significantly increased walking distances, but modestly, in contrast with previous results. Therefore, the duration of treatments at the doses tested was too short for meaningful effects on the treadmill test.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolaemia increase the risk for coronary heart disease, with type 2 diabetes mellitus being the most prevalent form of diabetes, frequently accompanied by dyslipidaemia. The main goal of dyslipidaemia control in nondiabetic and diabetic patients is to lower elevated low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Policosanol is a cholesterol-lowering drug, purified from sugarcane wax, with a therapeutic range of 5-20 mg/day, which significantly reduces LDL-C levels. Atorvastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor that, across its dose range (10-80 mg/day), has shown significantly greater lipid-lowering effects than all previously marketed statins. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects on lipid profile and platelet aggregation of policosanol and atorvastatin in patients with dyslipidaemia due to type 2 diabetes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomised, single-blind, parallel-group study was conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes (fasting glucose </=7 mmol/L and glycosylated haemoglobin [HbA(1c)] <8.5%) and high LDL-C levels (>/=3.0 mmol/L). After 6 weeks on a cholesterol-lowering diet, 40 patients were randomised to policosanol or atorvastatin 10mg tablets taken once daily with the evening meal for 8 weeks. Assessments of lipid profile, platelet aggregation tests, safety indicators and adverse events were performed. RESULTS: After 8 weeks of therapy, policosanol significantly lowered LDL-C by 25.7% (p < 0.0001 versus baseline) and total cholesterol (TC) by 18.2% (p < 0.001 versus baseline). In turn, atorvastatin 10 mg/day decreased LDL-C by 41.9% and TC by 31.5% (p < 0.0001 versus baseline). Atorvastatin was more effective than policosanol in reducing LDL-C and TC (p < 0.001). Policosanol also significantly reduced the TC/high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio (25.2%; p < 0.0001) and triglycerides (15.6%; p < 0.001), while atorvastatin lowered TC/HDL-C by 30.5% (p < 0.0001) and triglycerides by 13.9% (p < 0.001); the reductions on these variables were similar in the two groups. Policosanol, but not atorvastatin, significantly increased HDL-C (11.1%; p < 0.01), the effect being significantly different from that of atorvastatin (p < 0.0001). Also, policosanol, but not atorvastatin, significantly inhibited platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid 0.75 and 1.5 mmol/L (39.0% and 33.3%, respectively) and by collagen 0.25 and 0.5 mug/mL (15.7% and 28.5%, respectively) [p < 0.001]; these inhibitions were significantly different (p < 0.05) from the changes that occurred with atorvastatin. Neither drug significantly changed platelet aggregation elicited by adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Both treatments were well tolerated, with glycaemic control being unaffected. Neither drug impaired physical safety indicators or glucose control indicators (fasting glucose and HbA(1c)). Atorvastatin significantly increased levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) [p < 0.05] and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) [p < 0.01], while policosanol did not significantly change any safety indicator. Only three atorva-statin recipients showed individual values of ALT and CPK that were moderately enhanced (<3 times above the normal upper limit). No patients withdrew from the study. Four patients reported adverse events: two policosanol (insomnia and pruritus) and two atorvastatin (myalgia and raised arterial blood pressure) recipients. CONCLUSION: Policosanol (10 mg/day) for 8 weeks was less effective than similar doses of atorvastatin in reducing LDL-C and TC in patients with dyslipidaemia due to type 2 diabetes, but more effective in increasing HDL-C. Both drugs similarly reduced the TC/HDL-C ratio and triglycerides. Policosanol showed additional advantages regarding inhibition of platelet aggregation. Nevertheless, further studies of longer duration and using dose-titration schemes to achieve LDL-C goals are needed for wider conclusions about the respective effects of these two drugs in such a population subset."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Policosanol is one of the fastest growing over-the-counter supplements sold in the United States. The use of policosanol to treat elevated cholesterol is based on clinical trials conducted in Cuba, which showed sugar cane-derived policosanol to be similar in efficacy to statins. Recent studies have challenged these findings, but there have been no trials conducted in North America that have examined the ability of sugar cane-derived policosanol to lower cholesterol. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the efficacy of sugar cane-derived policosanol in healthy adults with mild hypercholesterolemia. The primary outcome was the percentage change in LDL cholesterol after 8 wk of therapy. Secondary outcome measures included changes in total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triacylglycerols, C-reactive protein, and nuclear magnetic resonance-determined lipoprotein profile. Dietary habits, weight, and blood pressure were also monitored. DESIGN: Ambulatory, community-dwelling healthy adults with mild hypercholesterolemia (n = 40) were assigned to receive oral policosanol (20 mg) or placebo once daily for 8 wk. This was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial conducted from January through August 2005. RESULTS: No significant differences in the change in LDL cholesterol were observed between the placebo (n = 20) and policosanol (n = 20) groups. Also, no significant changes in secondary outcome measures, including total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triacylglycerol, C-reactive protein, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-determined profiles were observed. Policosanol was well tolerated, and no significant adverse events were noted. CONCLUSION: Policosanol does not alter the serum lipid profile over an 8-wk period in adults with mild hypercholesterolemia.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Policosanol, commonly derived from purified sugar cane wax, has been reported to exert lipid-lowering effects. Policosanol is available in the United States as a nutritional supplement despite no US research clinical experience. This trial was designed to rigorously establish the lipid-lowering efficacy of policosanol as monotherapy and its potential additive and possibly synergistic effects when added to statin therapy. METHODS: A randomized, parallel, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled design was used. Patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels from 140 to 189 mg/dL were assigned into 1 of 4 groups to receive policosanol 20 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, combination therapy, or placebo for 12 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 99 patients were examined. Baseline characteristics were similar among all treatment groups. Policosanol (20 mg/d for 12 weeks) did not significantly change plasma total cholesterol, LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or triglyceride levels when compared with baseline values or with values of placebo-treated patients. Atorvastatin (10 mg/d for 12 weeks) reduced total cholesterol by 27% and LDL-C by 35%. Addition of policosanol to atorvastatin failed to produce any further reduction in lipid levels above that of atorvastatin alone. Policosanol was safe and did not affect liver enzyme or creatinine phosphokinase levels. CONCLUSIONS: Policosanol did not reduce LDL-C or total cholesterol levels either alone or in combination with atorvastatin. This observation supports the need for systematic evaluation of available products containing policosanol to determine their clinical lipid-lowering efficacy under rigorous experimental conditions. We propose that policosanol should be added to the list of nutritional supplements lacking scientific validity to support their use.",

      "abstract": "Stroke is a major health problem worldwide. Its pharmacological management includes thrombolytic therapy for the acute phase and antiplatelet drugs for stroke recovery and prevention. Statins can help in the acute phase and in preventing stroke in secondary prevention patients. Policosanol is a cholesterol-lowering drug with concomitant antiplatelet effects, with protective effects in stroke models. This observational study investigated the effects of policosanol (20 mg/day) administered during the acute phase and for 5 years later on the neurological recovery of patients with ischemic stroke treated with antiplatelets and vitamins. After hospital discharge, patients were followed up every 3 (first year) and 6 (thereafter) months. Neurological improvement was assessed with the modified Canadian Neurological Scale. Adverse events were recorded. Fifty patients were included; all completed the study. Neurological score improved throughout the study. No patient died, and most [40 (80.0%)] did not experience new vascular events; only one (2.0%) suffered a new stroke, and two (4.0%) suffered more than one transient ischemic attack. The time to the first recurrent event was 46.2 months. Policosanol persistently lowered serum total cholesterol, with such reduction correlating with the neurological improvement (R = 0.995253301). Triglycerides were unchanged. Treatment was well tolerated. Policosanol administered to patients suffering ischemic stroke treated with aspirin and vitamins showed good results on neurological outcomes and recurrent events. This study, however, has limitations, since it was open and uncontrolled, and patients also consumed aspirin and vitamins. New randomized, controlled studies are needed to assess the usefulness of policosanol in stroke management.",

The hypocholesterolemic effect results from a decrease in cholesterol synthesis by suppression of HMG-CoA reductase activity, but the mechanism of this suppression and the active components of policosanol have not been established. In the present study, we investigated the ability of policosanol and its principal components to inhibit cholesterol synthesis in cultured rat hepatoma cells. Maximal inhibition by policosanol yielded a 30% decrease in [(14)C]acetate incorporation without evidence of cellular toxicity. Octacosanol (C28, the major constituent of policosanol), heptacosanol (C27), and hexacosanol (C26) yielded smaller and statistically insignificant decreases in cholesterol synthesis, whereas triacontanol (1-hydroxytriacontane; C30) replicated the inhibition obtained with policosanol. At pharmacological concentrations (<5 microg/ml), policosanol and triacontanol decreased [(14)C]acetate incorporation into cholesterol without affecting the incorporation of [(14)C]mevalonate, indicating that these compounds act at or above HMG-CoA reductase. Policosanol and triacontanol did not directly inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, and incubation of these compounds with hepatoma cells did not affect reductase enzyme levels. However, reductase activity was decreased by up to 55% in lysates prepared from these cells, suggesting that HMG-CoA reductase activity was down-regulated by policosanol treatment. Consistent with this hypothesis, a 3-fold increase in AMP-kinase phosphorylation was noted in policosanol-treated cells. Because AMP-kinase is activated by phosphorylation and is well established to suppress HMG-CoA reductase activity, these results suggest that policosanol or a metabolite decreases HMG-CoA reductase activity by activating AMP-kinase.",

More than 80 placebo-controlled or comparative trials, performed mostly by a single research institute, suggest that policosanol at doses of 5 to 40 mg/d has lipoprotein-lowering effects comparable with statins. OBJECTIVES: To determine the lipoprotein-lowering effects of Cuban sugar cane-derived policosanol and to establish, if effective, dose-dependency up to 80 mg/d in patients with hypercholesterolemia or combined hyperlipidemia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A multicenter (lipid outpatient clinics and general practitioners in Germany), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial conducted from September 29, 2000, to May 10, 2001, of patients with hypercholesterolemia or combined hyperlipidemia having baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels of at least 150 mg/dL (> or =3.88 mmol/L) and either no or 1 cardiovascular risk factor other than known coronary heart disease, or baseline LDL-C levels of between 150 and 189 mg/dL (3.88-4.89 mmol/L) and 2 or more risk factors. INTERVENTIONS: Open-label 6-week placebo and diet run-in phase followed by a double-blind 12-week treatment phase after randomization to 5 groups: 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg/d of policosanol or placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The percentage change of LDL-C, with changes in other lipoproteins as secondary outcome measures. RESULTS: A total of 143 patients were randomized to 5 equal groups and were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. In none of the 5 treatment groups did LDL-C levels decrease more than 10% from baseline. No statistically significant difference between policosanol and placebo was observed. A nonparametric test analyzing dose-dependency yielded nonsignificant results. In none of the secondary outcome measures, namely total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoprotein(a), and ratio of total or LDL-C to HDL-C, were there any significant effects of policosanol. Policosanol was tolerated well without serious adverse events. CONCLUSION: In patients with hypercholesterolemia or combined hyperlipidemia, the sugar cane-derived policosanol in usual and high doses does not demonstrate a reduction in lipid levels beyond placebo.

Omega-3 fatty acids (FA) have triglyceride lowering and antiplatelet effects. Combination treatment with policosanol and omega-3 FA (Ω23FA) has been associated with significant inhibition of platelet aggregation in rabbits compared with either drug alone. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of combination treatment with Ω3FA (1 g/d) and policosanol (Ω3FA+Poli) compared with Ω3FA (1 g/d) plus placebo (Ω3FA+Pla) on platelet aggregation in human patients with hypercholesterolemia. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, clinical study at the Surgical Medical Research Center (Havana City, Cuba) recruited outpatients from lipid clinics, with some atherosclerotic risk factors. Outpatients of both sexes aged 20 to 75 years with serum total cholesterol (TC) levels ≥5 and <6 mmol/L were eligible to enroll. They were included in the study at the end of a 4-week diet stabilization period if their platelet aggregation to arachidonic acid (AA) was ≥50% and serum TC level remained ≥5 mmol/L. Patients were then evenly randomized to receive Ω3FA (1 g/d) + placebo or Ω3FA (1 g/d) + policosanol (10 mg/d) to be taken PO with the evening meal for 21 days. Treatment was assigned according to a randomization code using balanced blocks and a 1:1 allocation ratio. Inhibition of platelet aggregation to AA was the primary efficacy variable, while effects on platelet aggregation to collagen and epinephrine and on lipid profile were secondary variables. Drug compliance and adverse events (AEs) were monitored. Tolerability was assessed using physical examinations and laboratory test results. RESULTS: Sixty-four subjects were initially enrolled. Fifty-four patients (30 women, 24 men; mean [SD] age, 58.4 [12] years, [range, 40-70 years]) met the inclusion criteria and were randomized to treatment; 2 groups of 27. After 21 days, platelet aggregation to AA was significantly inhibited in the 2 groups. Ω3FA+Poli inhibited platelet aggregation to all agonists by ≥20%. Platelet aggregation to AA 1.0 and 1.5 mM was inhibited with combination treatment (39.6% and 33.9%, respectively; both P < 0.001 vs baseline; P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively, vs Ω3FA+Pla) and with Ω3FA+Pla (11.0% and 13.3%; both, P < 0.001). Combination treatment was more effective in inhibiting platelet aggregation to AA 1.0 and 1.5 mM in 28.6% (P < 0.001) and 20.6% (P < 0.01), respectively. Platelet aggregation to collagen 1 μg/mL was significantly inhibited with combination treatment and with Ω3FA+Pla compared with baseline (43.2% and 15.1%, respectively; both, P < 0.001), but the effects of combination treatment were significantly greater (P < 0.01). Platelet aggregation to epinephrine 0.1 mM was inhibited with Ω3FA+Poli and Ω3FA+Pla (34.8% and 20.1%; both, P < 0.001), with similar results for both groups. Bleeding time did not change significantly for either group and Ω3FA+Pla did not significantly change the lipid profile. Combination treatment did significantly reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (17.4%; P < 0.001 vs baseline, P < 0.05 vs Ω3FA+Pla) and TC (10.1%; P < 0.001 vs baseline, P < 0.05 vs Ω3FA+Pla), increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (18.0%; P < 0.001 vs baseline), but did not significantly change triglyceride levels. Three patients (2 from the Ω3FA+Poli group and 1 from the Ω3FA+Pla group) withdrew from the trial, though none were due to AEs. Two patients receiving combination treatment reported mild AEs (headache). All treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In these patients, policosanol (10 mg/d) administered concomitantly with Ω3FA (1 g/d) enhanced the inhibition of platelet aggregation to AA and collagen, but not to epinephrine, compared with Ω3FA+Pla, without significantly affecting bleeding time. Concomitant treatment was also associated with reduced levels of LDL-C and TC and raised HDL-C levels. All treatments were well tolerated."

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of a policosanol supplement (Octa-60) on lipid profiles of hypercholesterolaemic and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemic subjects. Nineteen hypercholesterolaemic and familial hypercholesterolaemic subjects completed this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. The subjects received either a daily dose of 20 mg policosanol or placebo for 12 weeks. After a wash-out period of 4 weeks, the interventions were crossed over. Lipid levels were measured at baseline and at the end of each intervention period. No significant differences in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol from baseline to end or between policosanol and placebo were seen in the hypercholesterolaemic or familial hypercholesterolaemic groups. There were small reductions in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol from baseline to end in the hypercholesterolaemic group, but these changes did not differ significantly from the changes with the placebo, indicating that the observed decrease in cholesterol in the policosanol group was not due to the specific effect of policosanol treatment. The differences in response may be ascribed to the differences in composition of the higher aliphatic primary alcohols in the previously used products, compared with the local policosanol supplement. An intake of 20 mg/d policosanol for 12 weeks had no significant effect on serum lipid levels in hypercholesterolaemic and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemic patients when compared with placebo intake.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Policosanol is a mixture of higher aliphatic primary alcohols purified from sugar-cane wax. The mixture has cholesterol-lowering efficacy, its specific effects being to reduce serum total (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The effects of policosanol on triglycerides (TG) are modest and inconsistent. Omega-3 fatty acids (FA) from fish oil protect against coronary disease, mainly through antiarrhythmic and antiplatelet effects. Omega-3 FA also have lipid-modifying effects, mostly relating to TG reduction. Thus, potential benefits could be expected from combined therapy with omega-3 FA and policosanol. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether combined therapy with omega-3 FA + policosanol offers benefits compared with omega-3 FA + placebo with respect to the lipid profile of patients with type II hypercholesterolaemia. METHODS: This randomised, double-blind study was conducted in 90 patients with type II hypercholesterolaemia. After 5 weeks on a cholesterol-lowering diet, patients were randomised to omega-3 FA + placebo, omega-3 FA + policosanol 5 mg/day or omega-3 FA + policosanol 10 mg/day for 8 weeks. Omega-3 FA was supplied as 1g capsules (two per day); placebo and policosanol were provided in tablet form. Physical signs and laboratory markers were assessed at baseline and after 4 and 8 weeks on therapy. Drug compliance and adverse experiences (AEs) were assessed at weeks 4 and 8. The primary efficacy variable was LDL-C reduction; other lipid profile markers were secondary variables. RESULTS: After 8 weeks, omega-3 FA + policosanol 5 and 10 mg/day, but not omega-3 FA + placebo, significantly reduced LDL-C by 21.1% and 24.4%, respectively (both p < 0.0001). Omega-3 FA + policosanol 5 mg/day also significantly lowered TC (12.7%; p < 0.01) and TG (13.6%; p < 0.05), and significantly increased HDL-C (+14.4%; p < 0.001). Omega-3 FA + policosanol 10 mg/day significantly decreased TC (15.3%; p < 0.001) and TG (14.7%; p < 0.01), and significantly increased HDL-C (+15.5%; p < 0.0001). Omega-3 FA + placebo significantly reduced TG (14.2%; p < 0.05) but had no significant effect on other lipid profile variables. The proportion of randomised patients in the omega-3 FA + policosanol 5 or 10 mg/day groups that achieved LDL-C targets or reductions 15% was significantly greater than in the omega-3 FA + placebo group (p < 0.001). Combined therapy with omega-3 FA + policosanol 5 or 10 mg/day resulted in significantly greater changes in LDL-C, TC and HDL-C than treatment with omega-3 FA + placebo, but did not modify the TG response compared with the omega-3 FA + placebo group. Four patients (two in the omega-3 FA + placebo group and two in the omega-3 FA + policosanol 10 mg/day group) withdrew from the study; none of these withdrawals was due to AEs. Two patients reported mild AEs, namely nausea/headache (one in the omega-3 FA + placebo group) and heartburn (one in the omega-3 FA + policosanol 5 mg/day group). CONCLUSIONS: Policosanol 5 or 10 mg/day administered concomitantly with omega-3 FA 1 g/day improved LDL-C, TC and HDL-C, maintained the reduction in TG attributable to omega-3 FA monotherapy, and was well tolerated. Treatment with omega-3 FA + policosanol could be useful for regulating lipid profile in patients with type II hypercholesterolaemia, but further studies involving larger sample sizes are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Policosanol is a drug derived from sugar cane wax that has cholesterol-lowering and antiplatelet properties. Randomized, controlled studies are the gold standard for demonstrating drug efficacy, safety, and tolerability, but postmarketing surveillance studies are encouraged for corroborating drug effects. A valid proof of the safety of a drug is a well-documented, good tolerability profile in older individuals, since this population is more prone to drug-related adverse events (AEs). OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the tolerability of policosanol in the elderly population by monitoring the incidence and nature of AEs occurring in older Cuban patients treated with policosanol in routine clinical practice. METHODS: All patients aged > or =60 years treated with policosanol at 7 major medical centers from January 2000 to May 2003 were included. Policosanol (5, 10, or 20 mg/d) was prescribed to patients eligible to receive cholesterol-lowering and/or antiplatelet drugs, with the dosage recommended according to their individual atherosclerotic risk. Patients had follow-up visits approximately every 6 months. Data on AEs and other relevant information, including changes in policosanol treatment, concomitant medications, and discontinuations, were recorded on individual case-report forms. RESULTS: This study included 2252 patients (1306 women, 946 men): 647 (28.7%), 244 (10.8%), and 173 (7.7%) patients had coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral artery disease, respectively. A total of 1485 patients had hypercholesterolemia (65.9%), 1322 (58.7%) had hypertension, and 323 (14.3%) had diabetes mellitus. Of the enrolled patients, 1123 (49.9%), 644 (28.6%), and 485 (21.5%) received policosanol 5, 10, and 20 mg/d, respectively. Treatment duration varied: 2169 (96.3%), 1861 (82.6%), 1116 (49.6%), and 412 (18.3%) patients were treated for 6, 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. Thirty-one patients (1.4%) experienced serious AEs, 18 of them fatal. Death was most often due to vascular events: myocardial infarction (4 patients), sudden cardiac arrest (1), ventricular arrhythmia (2), ischemic stroke (1), lung thromboembolism (1), cancer (5), pneumonia (1), peritonitis (1), lung edema (1), and dehydration (1). Another 13 patients (0.6%) were hospitalized, and 61 (2.7%) reported moderate or mild AEs. Overall, 21 patients (0.9%) discontinued prematurely from the study, 18 of them due to a fatal serious AE. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term tolerability of policosanol in elderly patients at high vascular risk was very good, as assessed under conditions of routine clinical practice. These results are consistent with those obtained in randomized, double-blind clinical studies of older patients treated with policosanol.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Policosanol is a mixture of high-molecular-weight aliphatic primary alcohols isolated from sugarcane wax with cholesterol-lowering and antiplatelet effects. Omega-3 fatty acids (FA) from fish oil can protect against coronary disease. An antiarrhythmic mechanism is emerging as the most convincing explanation for omega-3 FA cardiovascular protection, but triglyceride (TG)-lowering effects and inhibition of platelet function could play a role. In view of the effects of policosanol and omega-3 FA on lipid profile and platelet function, potential benefits of combined therapy were expected. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether combined therapy with policosanol and omega-3 FA would offer some benefit, compared with policosanol or omega-3 FA alone, on serum lipid profile and platelet aggregation in rabbits. METHODS: Male rabbits were randomly distributed in four groups (n = 9 per group). A control group received vehicle, one group was treated with policosanol 5 mg/kg and one with omega-3 FA (eicosapentaenoic acid; EPA [47.0%], docosahexaenoic acid; DHEA [41%]) 250 mg/kg, and the fourth received policosanol 5 mg/kg + omega-3 FA 250 mg/kg. Treatments were orally administered for 60 days. Bodyweight, food consumption and animal behaviour were performed at baseline and study completion. RESULTS: Policosanol significantly lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) [42.7%; p < 0.01] and total cholesterol (TC) [29.4%; p < 0.05], increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) [15.4%; p < 0.05], but left TG levels unchanged. Omega-3 FA significantly lowered TG (47.1%; p < 0.05), but left TC, LDL-C and HDL-C unchanged. Combined therapy decreased LDL-C (38.7%; p < 0.05). Changes in TC, LDL-C and HDL-C obtained with combined therapy were greater (p < 0.05) than those with omega-3 FA, but similar to those with policosanol, whereas the opposite applied to TG reduction. No significant changes in lipid profile were observed in the control group. Policosanol and omega-3 FA significantly (p < 0.05) but moderately inhibited platelet aggregation induced with arachidonic acid (13.3% and 12.4%, respectively); combined therapy achieved greater inhibition (23.9%; p < 0.05). All groups showed similar food consumption and bodyweight gain. No toxic signs were observed in any animal. CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent therapy with policosanol 5 m/kg and omega-3 FA 250 mg/kg lowered LDL-C, TC and TG and increased HDL-C. All treatments inhibited platelet aggregation, but better effects were observed with policosanol + omega-3 FA compared with either treatment alone. Combined therapy was well tolerated. These results suggest that treatment with policosanol + omega-3 FA could be useful for regulating lipid profile and inhibiting platelet aggregation, but conclusive demonstration of such effects requires further experimental and clinical studies.",

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. PATIENTS: A total of 4596 patients from 52 eligible studies. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from January 1967-June 2003 to identify pertinent studies. Reduction of LDL levels was the primary end point; effects on other lipid parameters and withdrawal of study patients due to adverse effects were the secondary end points. Weighted estimates of percent change in LDL were -11.0% for plant sterol and stanol esters 3.4 g/day (range 2-9 g/day [893 patients]) versus -2.3% for placebo (769 patients) in 23 eligible studies, compared with -23.7% for policosanol 12 mg/day (range 5-40 mg/day [1528 patients]) versus -0.11% for placebo (1406 patients) in 29 eligible studies. Cumulative p values were significantly different from placebo for both (p<0.0001). The net LDL reduction in the treatment groups minus that in the placebo groups was greater with policosanol than plant sterols and stanols (-24% versus -10%, p<0.0001). Policosanol also affected total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and triglyceride levels more favorably than plant sterols and stanols. Policosanol caused a clinically significant decrease in the LDL:HDL ratio. Pooled withdrawal rate due to adverse effects and combined relative risk for patients who withdrew were 0% and 0.84, respectively (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36-1.95, p=0.69), for plant sterols and stanols across 20 studies versus 0.86% and 0.31, respectively (95% CI 0.20-0.48, p<0.0001), for policosanol across 28 studies. CONCLUSION: Plant sterols and stanols and policosanol are well tolerated and safe; however, policosanol is more effective than plant sterols and stanols for LDL level reduction and more favorably alters the lipid profile, approaching antilipemic drug efficacy.",

      "abstract": "Policosanol is a cholesterol-lowering drug with concomitant antiplatelet effects. It is safe and well tolerated, even in populations with high consumption of concomitant drugs. These data suggest that adverse events (AE) due to drug-to-drug interactions (DDI) with policosanol are not relevant. Experimental data indicate that potential DDI between policosanol and drugs metabolized through the cytochrome P450 hepatic system are not expected, but pharmacodynamic DDI cannot be excluded. Several clinical studies have shown that policosanol decreased arterial pressure compared with placebo, and a pharmacological interaction with beta-blockers was experimentally proven. Therefore, clinical DDI between policosanol and beta-blockers can be expected. This study investigated whether policosanol reinforces the antihypertensive effects of beta-blockers and/or whether this combination impairs some safety indicators or induces specific AE in older patients. After 5 weeks on a diet-only baseline period, 205 older hypercholesterolemic patients taking beta-blockers were randomized to policosanol 5 mg/day or placebo for 3 years. After 1 year on therapy, policosanol significantly reduced (p < 0.00001 versus placebo) low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) (20.9%), total cholesterol (TC) (19.3%) and triglycerides (TG) (25.7%), whereas it increased (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001 versus placebo) high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (4.1%). Treatment effects did not to wear off during the 3-year follow-up. At study completion, policosanol lowered (p < 0.00001 versus placebo) LDL-C (34.3%), TC (23.2%) and TG (21.2%) and raised (p < 0.00001 versus placebo) HDL-C (12.3%). Thirty-one patients (15.1%) discontinued the study, 22 in the placebo group (20.6%) and nine in the policosanol group (9.2%). Of these, 20 patients (16 in the placebo group and four in the policosanol group) withdrew from the study due to AE. The frequency of serious adverse events (SAE), mostly vascular, in policosanol patients (3/98, 3.1%) was lower than in the placebo group (15/107, 14.0%). No impairment of safety indicators was observed. Nevertheless, reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were observed in policosanol patients compared with those in the placebo group. The frequency of policosanol patients reporting mild or moderate AE (18/98, 18.4%) was also lower than in the placebo group (30/107, 28.0%). In conclusion, policosanol was well tolerated in elderly patients taking beta-block- ers and did not increase AE. Additional reduction of blood pressure and a lower frequency of SAE were observed in policosanol patients compared with those taking placebo. The cholesterol-lowering efficacy of policosanol was that expected. These results provide support that policosanol therapy added to hypercholesterolemic elderly individuals taking beta-blockers could provide additional benefits in lowering blood pressure; SAE were not more frequent in the policosanol group than in the placebo group and there was no increase in AE.",

We investigated the effect of wheat germ policosanol (WGP) on plasma lipid profiles in 58 adults (30 men and 28 women, aged 49 +/- 11 years) with normal to mildly elevated plasma cholesterol concentrations in a double-blind, randomized, parallel placebo-controlled study. Subjects consumed chocolate pellets with or without 20 mg/d WGP for 4 weeks. Plasma lipid concentrations, routine blood chemistry and hematology were determined at the start and the end of the study. The initial plasma total, LDL-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, and triacylglycerol concentrations in the WGP and the control groups were identical. Over the 4 weeks, neither the WGP nor the control treatment significantly changed plasma total cholesterol, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, or triacylglycerol concentrations when compared to baseline values. In addition, there was no significant difference in plasma lipid profiles between the WGP and the control groups at the end of the study. WGP did not result in any adverse effects as indicated by plasma activities of L-gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT), ALT, AST, bilirubin concentrations, and blood cell profiles. Chemical analysis showed that WGP consists of 8% hexacosanol, 67% octacosanol, 12% triacosanol, and 13% other long-chain alcohols, which is similar to the composition of sugar cane policosanol. In conclusion, WGP at 20 mg/d had no beneficial effects on blood lipid profiles. It therefore seems unlikely that the long chain (C24-34) alcohols have any cholesterol-lowering activity.",

      "abstract": "Osteoporosis is characterized by reduced bone mass, abnormal bone architecture and increased fracture risk. Ovariectomy impairs bone mass and metabolism in rats and ovariectomized rats are considered as a suitable model of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Mevalonate is required for producing lipoids that are important in osteoclast activity and thus drugs affecting mevalonate production can prevent bone loss in rodents. Policosanol is a cholesterol-lowering drug isolated from sugar cane wax that inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis through an indirect regulation of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether policosanol could prevent bone loss in the bones of ovariectomized rats by comparing its effects with those induced by estradiol. Sprague Dawley female rats were randomly distributed in four groups: a sham-operated group treated with Tween/H2O vehicle and three groups of ovariectomized rats treated with 17beta-estradiol (30 microg/kg/day) or policosanol (50 and 200 mg/kg/day), respectively, for 3 months. At treatment completion the rats were sacrificed, their bones removed and variables of bone resorption and formation were investigated by histomorphometry. Ovariectomy increased trabecular separation but diminished the number and thickness of trabecules. Estradiol and policosanol prevented these effects compared with ovariectomized controls. Both treatments also prevented an increase in the number of osteoclasts and their surface area induced by ovariectomy. Estradiol, but not policosanol, significantly prevented an increase of osteoblast surface area compared with ovariectomized controls. In conclusion, policosanol prevented bone loss and decreased bone resorption in ovariectomized rats, suggesting that it should be potentially useful in preventing bone loss in postmenopausal women.",

      "abstract": "Policosanol is a cholesterol-lowering drug with concomitant antiplatelet effects. The present study was undertaken to compare the effects of policosanol and ticlopidine in patients with moderately severe intermittent claudication (IC). The study had a 4-week baseline step, followed by a 20-week double-blinded, randomized treatment period. Twenty-eight eligible patients were randomized to policosanol 10 mg or ticlopidine 250 mg tablets twice daily (bid). Walking distances in a treadmill (constant speed 3.2 km/hr, slope 10 degrees, temperature 25 degrees C) were assessed before and after 20 weeks of treatment. Both groups were similar at baseline. Compared with baseline, policosanol significantly increased (p < 0.01) mean values of initial (ICD) and absolute (ACD) claudication distances from 162.1 to 273.2 m and from 255.8 to 401.0 m, respectively. Ticlopidine also raised significantly (p < 0.01) ICD (166.2 to 266.3 m) and ACD (252.9 to 386.4 m). Comparisons between groups did not show significant differences. Policosanol, but not ticlopidine, significantly (p < 0.05), but modestly, increased the ankle/arm pressure ratio. After 10 weeks, policosanol significantly (p < 0.001) lowered low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC) (p < 0.01), and TC/HDL-C and raised (p < 0.05) high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). At study completion, policosanol lowered (p < 0.001) LDL-C (30.2%), TC (16.9%), and TC/HDL-C (33.9%), increased (p < 0.01) HDL-C (+31.7%), and left triglycerides unchanged. Ticlopidine did not affect the lipid profile variable. Policosanol induced modest, but significant, reductions (p < 0.01) of fibrinogen levels compared with baseline and ticlopidine. Treatments were well tolerated and did not impair safety indicators. Three ticlopidine patients (21.4%) withdrew from the trial, only 1 owing to a serious adverse experience (AE) (unstable angina). Three other ticlopidine patients experienced mild AE (headache, diarrhea, and acidity). It is concluded that policosanol (10 mg bid) can be as effective as ticlopidine (250 mg bid) for improving walking distances of claudicant patients, and it could be advantageous for the global risk of these individuals owing to its cholesterol-lowering effects. This study is, however, just a pilot comparison, so that further studies in larger sample sizes are needed for definitive conclusions of the comparative effects of both drugs on patients with IC.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease. Clinical studies have shown that lowering elevated serum cholesterol levels, particularly low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), is beneficial for patients with borderline to mildly elevated serum total cholesterol (TC) levels (5.0-6.0 mmol/L). Policosanol is a cholesterol-lowering drug made from purified sugar cane wax. The therapeutic range of policosanol is 5 to 20 mg/d. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the efficacy and tolerability of policosanol 5 mg/d in patients with borderline to mildly elevated serum TC levels. METHODS: This 14-week, single-center, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, comparative study was conducted in men and women aged 25 to 75 years with a serum TC level ≥4.8 to <6.0 mmol/L. After a 6-week run-in period in which patients were placed on therapeutic lifestyle changes, in particular a cholesterol-lowering diet, patients were randomly assigned to receive policosanol 5-mg tablets or placebo tablets once daily with the evening meal for 8 weeks, and the diet was continued throughout the study. Lipid profile variables, safety indicators, adverse events (AEs), and compliance with study medications were assessed. RESULTS: One hundred patients (71 women, 29 men; mean [SD] age, 52 [10] years) entered the study after the dietary run-in period. After 8 weeks of treatment, the mean (SD) serum LDL-C level decreased significantly in the policosanol group (P<0.001 vs baseline and placebo) from 3.57 (0.30) mmol/L to 2.86 (0.41) mmol/L (change, -19.9%). Significantly more patients in the policosanol group (42 patients [84%]) achieved a ≥15% decrease in serum LDL-C than in the placebo group (2 patients [4%]) (P<0.001). Also in the policosanol group, the mean (SD) serum TC level decreased significantly, from 5.20 (0.22) mmol/L to 4.56 (0.44) mmol/L (P<0.001 vs baseline and placebo) (change, -12.3%); the mean (SD) triglyceride (TG) level decreased significantly, from 1.59 (0.57) mmol/L to 1.48 (0.57) mmol/L (P<0.01 vs baseline; P<0.05 vs placebo) (change, -6.9%); and the mean (SD) high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level increased significantly from 1.05 (0.18) mmol/L to 1.16 (0.21) mmol/L (P<0.001 vs baseline and placebo) (change, +10.5%). The percentage changes were significantly different between the policosanol and placebo groups for serum LDL-C, TC, and HDL-C levels (P<0.001, P<0.001, and P<0.05, respectively), but not for TG. In the placebo group, changes in lipid profile variables from baseline were not significant. Policosanol did not significantly impair any safety indicator and was well tolerated. Three patients (3%) (1 patient [2%] in the policosanol group; 2 patients [4%] in the placebo group) withdrew from the trial, none because of AEs. Two patients (1 patient [2%] each in the policosanol and placebo groups) withdrew from the study because of an unwillingness to return for follow-up; 1 patient (2%) in the placebo group had a change of address and could not be followed up. Overall, 4 patients (4%) (1 patient [2%] in the policosanol group; 3 [6%], placebo) reported AEs; all were mild. Of the patients who received placebo and reported AEs, all 3 (6%) experienced heartburn, and 1 (2%) also experienced dry skin, while the policosanol-treated patient (2%) who reported an AE experienced headache. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of patients with borderline to mildly elevated serum TC levels, based on the criterion that ≥70% of policosanol-treated patients reached the LDL-C goal of a decrease ≥15% from baseline whenever this proportion was different with respect to placebo, 8 weeks of treatment with policosanol 5 mg/d was effective. The decreased LDL-C, TC, and TG levels, increased HDL-C level, and good tolerability found with this treatment support its use in such patients."

Twenty-eight patients who met study entry criteria were randomized to policosanol 10 mg or lovastatin 20 mg tablets once daily. Walking distances in a treadmill (constant speed 3.2 km/hr, slope 10 degrees, temperature 25 degrees C) were assessed before and after 20 weeks of treatment. Both groups were similar at randomization. Compared with baseline, policosanol increased significantly (p < 0.01) the initial claudication distance (ICD) from 160.39 +/- 15.82 m to 211.31 +/- 21.48 m (+33.7%) and the absolute claudication distance (ACD) (p < 0.001) from 236.39 +/- 25.44 m to 288.09 +/- 28.47 m (+24.3%); meanwhile both variables remained unchanged after lovastatin therapy. Changes in ICD and ACD were significantly larger in the policosanol than in the lovastatin group (p < 0.01). Policosanol, but not lovastatin, significantly increased (p < 0.05) the ankle/arm index, although between-group differences were not significant. The frequency of patients reporting improvement on quality of life domains was greater in the policosanol than in the lovastatin group. Policosanol significantly (p < 0.001) lowered total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) by 17.5% and 31.0%, respectively, and meanwhile increased (p < 0.01) high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels by 31.5%. Lovastatin reduced (p < 0.01) TC (18.0%), LDL-C (22.6%), and (p < 0.05) triglycerides (9.8%). In addition, policosanol, but not lovastatin, moderately, but significantly, reduced (p < 0.05) fibrinogen levels, so that final values and percent changes in both groups were different (p < 0.01). Treatments were well tolerated. Only 1 lovastatin patient withdrew from the study because of a nonfatal myocardial infarction. Five lovastatin patients, but none from the policosanol group, experienced 6 adverse events (AE) (p < 0.01). The present results indicate that policosanol, but not lovastatin, is a suitable alternative to manage patients with intermittent claudication because of pleiotropic properties beyond its cholesterol-lowering effects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypercholesterolaemia is a risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). Clinical studies have shown that lowering elevated serum total cholesterol (TC) levels, and particularly low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, reduces the frequency of coronary morbidity and deaths, whereas high serum levels of high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) protect against CHD. Policosanol is a cholesterol-lowering drug purified from sugar cane wax with a therapeutic dosage range from 5-20 mg/day. Atorvastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor which across its dosage range (10-80 mg/day) has shown significantly greater lipid-lowering effects than all previously marketed statins. OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to compare the efficacy and tolerability of policosanol with atorvastatin in older patients with type II hypercholesterolaemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomised, single-blind, parallel-group study was conducted in older patients (60-80 years) with type II hypercholesterolaemia. After 4 weeks on a cholesterol-lowering diet, 75 patients were randomised to policosanol or atorvastatin 10mg tablets taken once daily with the evening meal for 8 weeks. An interim and final check-up were performed at 4 and 8 weeks, respectively, after treatment was initiated. RESULTS: At 4 (p < 0.0001) and 8 (p < 0.00001) weeks, policosanol 10 mg/day significantly lowered serum LDL-C levels by 17.5 and 23.1%, respectively compared with baseline; corresponding values for atorvastatin were 28.4 and 29.8%. At study completion, policosanol significantly (p < 0.0001) reduced serum TC (16.4%), LDL-C/HDL-C ratio (25.5%) and TC/HDL-C ratio (19.3%), as well as (p < 0.001) triglyceride levels (15.4%). Atorvastatin significantly (p < 0.0001) decreased serum TC (22.6%), LDL-C/HDL-C (26.2%) and TC/HDL-C (19.8%) ratios, as well as (p < 0.001) triglyceride levels (15.5%). Atorvastatin was significantly more effective than policosanol in reducing LDL-C and TC, but similar in reducing both atherogenic ratios and triglyceride levels. Policosanol, but not atorvastatin, significantly (p < 0.05) increased serum HDL-C levels by 5.3%. Both treatments were well tolerated. At study completion, atorvastatin mildly, but significantly (p < 0.05) increased creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and creatinine, whereas policosanol significantly reduced AST and glucose (p < 0.01) and CPK (p < 0.05) levels. All individual values, however, remained within normal limits. Three atorvastatin but no policosanol patients withdrew from the study because of adverse events: muscle cramps (1 patient), gastritis (1 patient) and uncontrolled hypertension, abdominal pain and myalgia (1 patient). Overall, no policosanol and seven atorvastatin patients (18.9%) reported a total of nine mild or moderate adverse events during the study (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that policosanol (10 mg/day) administered for 8 weeks was less effective than atorvastatin (10 mg/day) in reducing serum LDL-C and TC levels in older patients with type II hypercholesterolaemia. Policosanol, but not atorvastatin, however, significantly increased serum HDL-C levels, whereas both drugs similarly reduced atherogenic ratios and serum triglycerides. Policosanol was better tolerated than atorvastatin as revealed by patient withdrawal analysis and overall frequency of adverse events. Nevertheless, further studies must be conducted in larger sample sizes and using dose-titration methods to achieve target lipid levels in order to reach wider conclusions.",

      "abstract": "Many of the wide-ranging health benefits conferred by statin therapy are mediated, not by reductions in LDL cholesterol, but rather by inhibition of isoprenylation reactions essential to the activation of Rho family GTPases; this may be the mechanism primarily responsible for the favorable impact of statins on risk for ischemic stroke, senile dementia, and fractures, as well as the anti-hypertensive and platelet-stabilizing actions of these drugs. Indeed, the extent of these benefits is such as to suggest that most adults would be wise to take statins; however, owing to the significant expense of statin therapy, as well as to the potential for dangerous side effects that mandates regular physician follow-up, this strategy appears impractical. However, policosanol, a mixture of long-chain aliphatic alcohols extractable from sugar cane wax, has shown cholesterol-lowering potency comparable to that of statins, and yet appears to be devoid of toxic risk. Recent evidence indicates that policosanol down-regulates cellular expression of HMG-CoA reductase, and thus has the potential to suppress isoprenylation reactions much like statins do. Consistent with this possibility, the results of certain clinical and animal studies demonstrate that policosanol has many effects analogous to those of statins that are not likely explained by reductions of LDL cholesterol. However, unlike statins, policosanol does not directly inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, and even in high concentrations it fails to down-regulate this enzyme by more than 50% - thus likely accounting for the safety of this nutraceutical. In light of the fact that policosanol is quite inexpensive and is becoming available as a non-prescription dietary supplement, it may represent a practical resource that could enable the general public to enjoy health benefits comparable to those conferred by statins. In a long-term clinical study enrolling patients with significant symptomatic coronary disease, Esselstyn has demonstrated that a low-fat, whole-food vegan diet, coupled with sufficient statin therapy to maintain serum cholesterol below 150 mg/dL, can stop the progression of coronary disease and virtually eliminate further risk for heart attack. A comparable regimen, in which policosanol is used in place of statins, may represent a practical strategy whereby nearly everyone willing to commit to health-protective eating can either prevent coronary disease, or prevent pre-existing coronary disease from progressing to a life-threatening event.",

The present study was undertaken to compare the effects of a higher dose of policosanol, a cholesterol-lowering drug, (40 mg/day) with the effects of 20 mg/day policosanol on platelet aggregation in healthy volunteers and type II hypercholesterolaemic patients. 2. Study subjects were randomized to receive, under double-blind conditions, placebo or policosanol (20 or 40 mg/day) for 30 days once a day. Blood sampling was performed at baseline and after 30 days on therapy. 3. Platelet aggregation was induced with three aggregating agents: arachidonic acid (AA), collagen and low doses of ADP. 4. Policosanol (20 and 40 mg/day) moderately yet significantly reduced platelet aggregation, but no differences were observed in the effects produced by either dose of policosanol. In healthy volunteers, policosanol at 20 and 40 mg/day inhibited aggregation induced by 2 mmol/L AA (28.2 and 24.9%, respectively), 1 micro g/mL collagen (21.1 and 20.2%) and 1 micro mol/L ADP (30.9 and 29.1%). Changes that occurred following the administration of placebo were not significant, although an upward trend for collagen- and ADP-induced aggregation occurred in normal and hypercholesterolaemic subjects, respectively, thus partially masking the effects of policosanol on these responses. 5. The antiplatelet effects of policosanol at 20 and 40 mg/day in hypercholesterolaemic patients were also similar, so that both doses inhibited aggregation induced by 1.5 mmol/L AA (20.1 and 33.0%, respectively), 0.5 micro g/mL collagen (22.7 and 21.1%) and 1 micro mol/L ADP (40.5 and 34.7%). 6. In addition, after 30 days of therapy, 20 and 40 mg/day policosanol significantly (P < 0.01) reduced low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (15.9 and 17.0%, respectively) and total cholesterol (12.4 and 12.3%, respectively; P < 0.05), yet increased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol values by 5% in both groups (P < 0.05). 7. Triglycerides were decreased compared with baseline, but not with respect to the placebo. 8. We conclude that the antiplatelet effects induced by 40 mg/day policosanol administered for 30 days to healthy volunteers and to hypercholesterolaemic patients were similar to the effects induced by 20 mg/day policosanol. Thus, no enhancement of the response was achieved with the use of a higher dose of policosanol in study patients.",

      "abstract": "Policosanol is a mixture of alcohols isolated and purified from sugar cane. Recently, Cuban researchers found 5-20 mg daily of policosanol to be effective at improving serum lipid profiles. Policosanol is believed to decrease total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis and increasing LDL processing. Lipid profile improvements are seen in healthy volunteers, patients with type II hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetics with hypercholesterolemia, postmenopausal women with hypercholesterolemia, and patients with combined hypercholesterolemia and abnormal liver function tests. Additionally, policosanol has performed equal to or better than simvastatin, pravastatin, lovastatin, probucol, or acipimox with fewer side effects in patients with type II hypercholesterolemia. Policosanol also decreases several other risk factors of cardiovascular disease by decreasing LDL oxidation, platelet aggregation, endothelial damage, and smooth muscle cell proliferation. Furthermore, policosanol decreases progression and increases regression of cardiovascular disease assessed by thallium-labeled myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (TL-MPS) and Doppler-ultrasound, and decreases symptoms of cardiovascular disease assessed by the Specific Activity Scale. In post-marketing studies, only 0.31 percent of patients have had adverse events. Furthermore, in animal toxicity studies doses up to 1500 times normal human doses (on the basis of body weight) have shown no negative effects on carcinogenesis, reproduction, growth, and development. However, despite the positive research on policosanol on Cubans, policosanol produced in Cuba is not available in the United States, and only Cuban subjects have been studied. Further research is needed to determine if the same effects will be obtained in U.S. populations with non-Cuban produced policosanol.",

PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: 589 older male and female patients with hypertension and type II hypercholesterolaemia and no history of CHD or cerebrovascular disease were included. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in parallel groups treated with policosanol (5 to 10 mg/day) for 1 year. After 6 weeks on a standard step I cholesterol-lowering diet, 589 patients were randomised to policosanol (5 mg) or placebo tablets, to be taken once daily for 12 months. The dosage was doubled to 10 mg/day if total cholesterol values were > 6.1 mmol/L after 6 months of therapy. RESULTS: Policosanol significantly (p < 0.00001) lowered serum low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) [20.5%], total cholesterol (TC) [15.4%], triglycerides (11.9%), LDL-C/high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio [22.2%] and TC/HDL-C ratio (20.1%), and increased (p < 0.0001) HDL-C (12.7%). The frequency of vascular and all-cause serious adverse events (SAEs) was lower (p < 0.05) in the policosanol recipients (two vascular SAEs, 0.7%; five all-cause SAEs, 1.7%) than in the placebo recipients (six vascular SAEs, 2.0%; 12 all-cause SAEs, 4.1%). Similarly, total adverse events (AEs) were less frequent in the policosanol-treated group (29; 9.8%) compared with the placebo group (52; 17.7%) [p < 0.01]. Three placebo recipients and no policosanol recipents died during the study as a result of myocardial infarction (two patients) and sudden cardiac arrest (one). Policosanol was well tolerated, and no drug-related disturbances in safety indicators were found. Policosanol significantly decreased systolic blood pressure (BP) compared with baseline and placebo, which could be an additional advantage in this population at high coronary risk. CONCLUSIONS: Policosanol administered long term is effective in lowering LDL-C and TC as well as increasing HDL-C levels in older patients with hypertension and type II hypercholesterolaemia without a history of CHD or cerebrovascular disease. In addition, policosanol treatment also shows benefits in the occurrence of SAEs of vascular aetiology, on the general AE profile and the reduction of BP in treated patients compared with baseline.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Policosanol is a mixture of higher primary aliphatic alcohols isolated from sugar cane wax, whose main component is octacosanol. The mixture has been shown to lower cholesterol in animal models, healthy volunteers, and patients with type II hypercholesterolemia. METHODS: We reviewed the literature on placebo-controlled lipid-lowering studies using policosanol published in peer-reviewed journals as well as studies investigating its mechanism of action and its clinical pharmacology. RESULTS: At doses of 10 to 20 mg per day, policosanol lowers total cholesterol by 17% to 21% and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 21% to 29% and raises high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 8% to 15%. Because higher doses have not been tested up to now, it cannot be excluded that effectiveness may be even greater. Daily doses of 10 mg of policosanol have been shown to be equally effective in lowering total or LDL cholesterol as the same dose of simvastatin or pravastatin. Triglyceride levels are not influenced by policosanol. At dosages of up to 20 mg per day, policosanol is safe and well tolerated, as studies of >3 years of therapy indicate. There is evidence from in vitro studies that policosanol may inhibit hepatic cholesterol synthesis at a step before mevalonate generation, but direct inhibition of the hydroxy-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase is unlikely. Animal studies suggest that LDL catabolism may be enhanced, possibly through receptor-mediated mechanisms, but the precise mechanism of action is not understood yet. Policosanol has additional beneficial properties such as effects on smooth muscle cell proliferation, platelet aggregation, and LDL peroxidation. Data on efficacy determined by clinical end points such as rates of cardiac events or cardiac mortality are lacking. CONCLUSIONS: Policosanol seems to be a very promising phytochemical alternative to classic lipid-lowering agents such as the statins and deserves further evaluation.",

This randomized, double-blind study investigated the cholesterol-lowering efficacy and tolerability of policosanol 20 mg/day compared with 40 mg/day. Changes in low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels were predefined as the primary efficacy endpoint. Patients with type II hypercholesterolemia were enrolled in the study and instructed to continue a step I cholesterol-lowering diet for 6 weeks and those eligible to be included (89) were randomly allocated to receive under double-blind conditions placebo (n = 30), policosanol 20 mg/day (n = 29) or 40 mg/day (n = 30). After 24 weeks, policosanol at 20 and 40 mg/day significantly (p < 0.00001) lowered LDL-cholesterol by 27.4% and 28.1%, total cholesterol (p < 0.00001) by 15.6% and 17.3%, and the LDL-cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol ratio by 37.2% and 36.5%, respectively The ratio of total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol was lowered by 27.1% and 27.5%, while HDL-cholesterol levels increased (p < 0.001) by 17.6% and 17.0%, respectively. Compared with baseline, policosanol 20 mg/day lowered triglycerides (p < 0.05) by 12.7%, while they were lowered (p < 0.01) by 15.6% at a dose of policosanol 40 mg/day All the above-mentioned significant differences were also different from placebo and no significant changes occurred in any lipid profile parameters in the placebo group. Based on the mean values of LDL-cholesterol levels at study completion, the mean percent reductions from baseline were 27.4% and 28.1% for the 20 and 40 mg/day groups, respectively. Thus, the effects of both policosanol doses on the main efficacy variable were practically identical. Consistent with the data obtained for LDL-cholesterol, both doses were similarly effective in changing all the other lipid profile parameters. No unexpected adverse effects were observed and there were no significant between-group differences regarding safety indicator values or reported adverse effects. In conclusion, although the tolerability profile remains excellent, according to the present results policosanol at a dose of 40 mg/day does not offer significant additional cholesterol-lowering efficacy over the 20 mg/day dose.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cholesterol biosynthesis is strictly controlled by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. METHODS: Transfer of cultured fibroblasts to a lipid-depleted medium (LDM) up-regulates the enzyme levels. This, in turn, is followed by an accelerated biosynthesis of cholesterol. RESULTS: Exposure of Vero fibroblasts to LDM and policosanol (0.5-50 microg/mL), a new cholesterol-lowering drug purified from sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) wax, decreased in a dose-dependent manner cholesterol biosynthesis from [14C]-acetate and 3H-water, but not from [14C]-mevalonate. CONCLUSIONS: This suggests an effect on HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-controlling enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. When enzyme activity was measured in the presence of various concentrations of policosanol (0.5-50 microg/mL), reductase was not suppressed. Therefore, there was no evidence for a competitive or noncompetitive inhibition of enzyme activity. However, after treatment of intact cells with policosanol (50 microg/mL) in the presence of LDM, a suppressive effect on enzyme activity was observed, suggesting a modulatory effect of policosanol on reductase activity. The previous inhibition of enzyme up-regulation by policosanol suggests to date a depression of de novo synthesis of HMG-CoA reductase and/or stimulation of its degradation. However, the exact mechanism by which policosanol inhibits the activity of HMG-CoA reductase still remains unclear. Further studies are needed to clarify the precise mechanism of its inhibitory action on cholesterol biosynthesis.",

This study was undertaken to investigate the long-term effects of policosanol administered to patients with moderately severe intermittent claudication. The study consisted of a 6-week single-blind, placebo-controlled run in phase, followed by a 2-year double-blind, randomized treatment step. Fifty-six patients who met study entry criteria were randomized to receive placebo or policosanol 10 mg twice daily. Walking distances on a treadmill (constant speed 3.2 km/h, slope 10 degrees, temperature 25 degrees C) were assessed before and after 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of treatment. Both groups were similar at randomization. After 6 months of therapy, policosanol significantly increased (p < 0.01) the initial claudication distance from 125.9 +/- 8.7 m to 201.1 +/- 24.8 m and the absolute claudication distance from 219.5 +/- 14.1 m to 380.7 +/- 50.2 m. Both variables remained unchanged in the placebo group (p < 0.01). These effects did not wear off but improved after long-term therapy, so that final values were 333.5 +/- 28.6 m (initial claudication distance) and 648.9 +/- 54.1 m (absolute claudication distance); both significantly greater (p < 0.0001) than those obtained in the placebo group, which showed values of 137.9 +/- 21.8 m (initial claudication distance) and 237.7 +/- 28.1 m (absolute claudication distance), respectively. At study completion, 21 policosanol and 5 placebo patients attained increases in claudication distance values > 50% (p < 0.001). Policosanol, but not placebo, significantly increased the ankle/arm pressure index. In addition, from month 6 up to study completion, the frequency of patients reporting improvement of lower limb symptoms was greater in the policosanol group than in the placebo group. The treatment was tolerated well. There were 16 withdrawals (12 placebo, 4 policosanol) from the study. Eight patients in the placebo group experienced a total of 10 serious adverse events, 8 of which were vascular events, compared with none in the policosanol group (p < 0.01). In addition, 3 patients in the policosanol group and 3 patients in the placebo group reported mild adverse events during the study. The present results demonstrate the long-term usefulness of policosanol therapy to treat patients with intermittent claudication.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of policosanol on the susceptibility of LDL-C to in vitro lipid peroxidation in human healthy volunteers. METHODS: The effect of policosanol (5 and 10 mg day(-1) on LDL-C oxidation was studied in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 69 subjects. LDL-C samples isolated at baseline and after 8 weeks were subjected to in vitro tests of LDL-C oxidation. We tested the susceptibility of LDL-C to lipid peroxidation in a cell-free system by the addition of copper ions as well as in a more physiological system, macrophage-mediated oxidation. RESULTS: At baseline all groups were well matched regarding all variables. After 8 weeks of therapy policosanol administered at 5 and 10 mg, significantly and in a dose-dependent manner increased the lag phase of conjugated diene generation (mean +/- s.d.) from 83.79+/-29.16 min to 94.90+/-25.50 min (5 mg day(-1)) and from 82.74+/-17.16 min to 129.89+/-35.71 min (10 mg day(-1)), while in the placebo group LDL-C oxidation did not change significantly. Policosanol (10 mg day(-1)), but not placebo, significantly decreased the rate of conjugated diene generation. Comparison with placebo after therapy also showed significant differences. Macrophage mediated-oxidation was also inhibited by policosanol as evident by measuring thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Policosanol (10 mg day(-1)) significantly lowered malondialdehyde (MDA) generation from 8.50+/-0.91 to 5.76+/- 1.01 nmol mg(-1) protein. Comparison with placebo after 5 and 10 mg day(-1) showed significant differences. Policosanol significantly lowered total cholesterol by 10.5% (5 mg day(-1)) and 12.4% (10 mg day(-1)) and LDL-C by 16.7% and 20.2%, respectively. Also, policosanol (10 mg day(-1)) increased HDL-C by 15.2%. Five subjects withdrew from the study, none because of adverse experiences. No clinical or blood biochemical drug-related disturbances were found. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that policosanol administered within its therapeutic dosage for lowering cholesterol (5 and 10 mg day(-1)), decreased the susceptibility of LDL-C to lipid peroxidation in vitro.",

After 6 weeks on a lipid lowering diet, 53 patients were randomized to receive either policosanol or lovastatin tablets that were taken o.i.d. for 12 weeks under double-blind conditions. Both groups were similar at randomization. Policosanol significantly (p < 0.001) lowered low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (20.4%), total cholesterol (14.2%) and the ratio of LDL-cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (23.7%). Lovastatin significantly (p < 0.01) lowered LDL-cholesterol (16.8%), total cholesterol (14.0%) and the ratio (p < 0.05) of LDL-cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol (14.9%). Triglyceride levels did not significantly change after therapy. Policosanol, but not lovastatin, significantly increased (p < 0.01) levels of HDL-cholesterol (7.5%). Comparison between groups showed that changes in HDL-cholesterol induced by policosanol were significantly greater (p < 0.01) than those induced by lovastatin. Both treatments were safe and well tolerated. Lovastatin moderately but significantly (p < 0.05) increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase, creatine phosphokinase and alkaline phosphatase. Adverse reactions were more frequent in the lovastatin group (p < 0.01) than in the policosanol group. In conclusion, policosanol administered at 10 mg/day produces more advantageous changes in HDL-cholesterol and has a better safety and tolerability profile than lovastatin 20 mg/day.",

Thirty sedentary healthy students were tested before and after treatment (3.6 mg/die for 7 days) with orally administered tablets of placebo (group A), isopolicosanol (B) and octacosanol (C). RT were studied according to three procedures: simple RT (SRT), go/no-go RT (GRT) and choice RT (CRT). Results show that before treatment, there were no significant differences between groups A, B and C. After treatment, the RT of group A was unchanged, while the RT of groups B and C were reduced. In group B, in the SRT test, the reduction of RT was accompanied by electrical data exhibiting increased amplitudes of CNV and shorter latencies of P3. These results show that the main effect on reactivity and event-related potentials can be ascribed to policosanol and is mainly evident in the SRT test.",

Sixty-three patients were randomized to receive either policosanol (10 mg/day) or acipimox (750 mg/day) tablets for 8 weeks under double-blind conditions. Both groups were similar at randomization. Policosanol significantly reduced total cholesterol (p < 0.0001) (15.8%), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (21%) and the ratios of LDL-cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (15.8%) and cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol (11.5%). Acipimox significantly lowered both cholesterol and LDL cholesterol by 7.5%. The percent changes of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and both ratios were larger in the policosanol group than in the acipimox group. Both drugs were well tolerated. Acipimox significantly increased (p > 0.001) aspartate amino transferase levels but only four patients showed increases above the normal limit. Policosanol significantly reduced creatinine values (p > 0.05) but no patients had values out of the normal range. Four patients withdrew from the study (two from each group) but none withdrew because of adverse effects. No adverse effects were reported in the policosanol group, while five patients on acipimox reported adverse effects (hot flushes, nausea, vomiting, headache, hypochondrial pain and leg edema). These results indicate that policosanol (10 mg/day) was more effective and well tolerated than was acipimox (750 mg/day) in this study population.",

Serum cholesterol was measured again after 8 weeks of therapy. RESULTS: Initial demographic and laboratory data were similar among treatment groups. A 24% LDL cholesterol reduction was obtained with policosanol, compared with a 22% reduction with lovastatin and a 15% reduction with simvastatin. HDL cholesterol significantly increased in patients on policosanol and did not change in the other treatment groups. Adverse effects of policosanol were mild and unspecific.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: After 5 weeks of a standard step-1 lipid-lowering diet, 437 patients were randomized to receive, under double-blind conditions, 5 mg policosanol or placebo once a day with the evening meal for 12 weeks and 10 mg policosanol or placebo for the next 12 weeks. RESULTS: Both groups were similar at randomization. Policosanol (5 and 10 mg/day) significantly reduced (P < .001) serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (18.2% and 25.6%, respectively) and cholesterol (13.0% and 17.4%), and it significantly raised (P < .01) high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (15.5% and 28.4%). Triglycerides remained unchanged after the first 12 weeks and lowered significantly (5.2%; P < .01) at study completion. Policosanol was safe and well tolerated, and no drug-related disturbances were observed. Two male patients who received placebo died during the study--one because of a myocardial infarction and the other because of a cardiac arrest that occurred during a surgical intervention. There were 11 serious adverse events (5.1%) in 10 patients who received placebo (4.6%), 7 of which were vascular, compared with no serious adverse events reported in patients receiving policosanol (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Subjects in the group treated with policosanol did not have serious adverse events during the 24-week study. This study shows that policosanol is effective, safe, and well tolerated in patients with hypercholesterolemia and concomitant coronary risk factors.",

After a baseline period of 6 weeks, 62 patients were randomized to receive, under double-blind conditions, either placebo (31 patients) or policosanol (31), 10 mg twice daily. Walking distances in a treadmill (constant speed 3.2 km/hr, slope 10 degrees) were assessed before and after 6 months of treatment. Both groups were similar at randomization. Policosanol increased significantly (p < 0.01) the initial claudication distance from 132.5+/-13.5 m (baseline) to 205.7+/-36.3 m (after therapy) and the absolute claudication distance (p<0.0001) from 229.5+/-22.0 m to 365.4+/-46.9 m; meanwhile both variables remained unchanged in the placebo group (p<0.05). The reduction of lower limb symptoms showed a greater benefit in the policosanol group. There was no significant change in either group in the ankle/arm pressure ratio. The treatment was well tolerated. There were 10 discontinuations (seven placebo, three policosanol) from the study. Six withdrawals occurred because of adverse events (AE); all were in placebo patients. There were five serious vascular AEs in the placebo group but none in the policosanol group (p<0.05). Overall, 12/31 (38.7%) placebo patients and 3/31 (9.7%) policosanol patients experienced AEs after randomization, which showed a lesser incidence of AEs in the policosanol group (p<0.01). The present study demonstrates a beneficial effect of policosanol in patients with intermittent claudication.",

      "abstract": "This study examined the effects of long-term lipid-lowering therapy with policosanol on the clinical evolution, and exercise-ECG testing responses of 45 coronary heart disease (CHD) patients with myocardial ischemia, documented by exercise 201T1-myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, in an overall randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, made for different test endpoints. Fifteen patients were treated with 5 mg of policosanol twice daily; another 15 patients were administered the same drug dose plus 125 mg aspirin; and the other 15 patients received placebo plus equal aspirin dose. They were followed for 20 months, previous baseline observations, with treadmill exercise-ECG, besides serum lipid test. Beneficial changes on proportions among the 2 policosanol groups and the placebo group, showed an increment on functional capacity class, a decrement on rest and exercise angina, and a significant decrease in cardiac events, and in ischemic ST segment response, especially in the policosanol plus aspirin group (p = 0.05, X2(2df) = 5.8; p = 0.04, p = 0.02; Fisher). After treatment, sets of mean changes revealed an increase on maximum oxygen uptake, and a decline on double product simultaneously in both policosanol groups (p < or = 0.02, p < or = 0.002; Pillais, Hotellings' T2), while the placebo group was impaired. Aerobic functional capacity percent showed an increment in policosanol groups (p < or = 0.05, paired T). Lipid levels improved as other endpoints already reported. A supposed ergogenic effect of octacosanol, policosanol's main active compound, was not detected with this design. These results show that policosanol-treated CHD patients improved clinical evolution, and exercise-ECG responses, owing to the amelioration of myocardial ischemia, even more when administered with aspirin.",

The healthy volunteers were randomly treated for 7 days. Both, platelet aggregation and coagulation time were measured at baseline and after therapy. When policosanol was administered platelet aggregation induced by ADP (37.3%), epinephrine (32.6%) and collagen (40.5%) were significantly reduced. Meanwhile, aspirin significantly reduced platelet aggregation induced by collagen (61.4%) and epinephrine (21.9%) but not ADP-induced aggregation. Combined therapy significantly inhibited aggregation induced by all the agonists reaching the highest reductions of platelet aggregation induced by collagen (71.3%) and epinephrine (57.5%). Coagulation time did not change significantly in any group. No subject withdrew from the trial. Four volunteers reported mild adverse experiences during the study: three ASA-treated cases referred headache, epigastralgia and nose bleeding, meanwhile one patient receiving combination therapy reported gum bleeding. The present results demonstrate that policosanol (20 mg day-1) is as effective as ASA (100 mg day-1). Moreover, combination therapy shows some advantages compared with the respective monotherapies.",

When policosanol was administered by the oral route once daily for 30 d (50 mg/kg) the increases in plasma total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol (LDC-C) were significantly reduced when compared with the control group. The incorporation of 3H2O into sterols in the liver was significantly depressed, suggesting inhibition of hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis. The oral administration of policosanol raised the rate of removal of 125I-labelled LDL from serum. Kinetic parameters calculated following injection of [125I]LDL showed than in casein-fed rabbits, the terminal half-life (t1/2) was significantly decreased after policosanol treatment. The hepatic LDL-binding activity was increased after policosanol administration which suggested that the enhanced clearance was due, at least in part, to increased receptor-mediated uptake of LDL by the liver. Considered together, these results suggest that policosanol can significantly reduce the increase of plasma LDL-C in rabbits fed on a wheat starch-casein diet by reducing cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver. Such an effect could account for the enhancement of LDL catabolism through the receptor-mediated pathway.",

Absolute rates of incorporation of 3H-water in sterols were depressed by policosanol by about 20%, giving a more accurate degree of cholesterol biosynthesis inhibition in this species. Since policosanol did not inhibit labeled mevalonate incorporation into cholesterol in rat liver, we also studied the effect of policosanol on hydroxy-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Reductase activity assayed in microsomes treated with policosanol remained unchanged, suggesting that cholesterol synthesis is not inhibited by a direct action of policosanol on this enzyme.",

NIDDM predisposes patients to coronary artery disease (CAD) through the direct action of hyperglycemia on the arteries as well as the dyslipidemia induced by NIDDM. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This double-blind placebo-controlled trial was performed in 29 patients with NIDDM and hypercholesterolemia. After stable glycemic control was achieved by diet and/or oral hypoglycemic drugs, patients were instructed to follow a cholesterol-lowering diet for 6 weeks. Patients who met entry criteria received, under double-blind conditions, policosanol (5 mg) or placebo tablets twice a day for 12 weeks. RESULTS: Policosanol (10 mg/day) significantly reduced total cholesterol by 17.5% and LDL cholesterol by 21.8% compared with baseline and placebo. Furthermore, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was raised by 11.3% (not significant), and triglycerides showed a statistically nonsignificant decrease of 6.6%. These changes in lipid profile were similar to those induced by policosanol in nondiabetic patients with type II hyperlipoproteinemia. CONCLUSIONS: Glycemic control was unaffected by treatment. No clinically or biochemically adverse effects attributable to treatment were observed. Only one patient (placebo) withdrew from the trial because of an adverse experience (erythema). We concluded that policosanol is effective and safe in patients with NIDDM and hypercholesterolemia.",

The study included 69 patients from both sexes, in whom total cholesterol and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were not controlled sufficiently by diet. The treatment effect on total cholesterol and LDL-C was maintained during the 2-year follow up. Thus, percent reductions 24 months after therapy were 25% (LDL-C) and 18% (cholesterol). All comparisons with placebo were significant. Similarly, ratios of LDL-C to HDL-C and cholesterol to HDL-C were significantly reduced and such decreases were maintained during the study. Policosanol raised significantly the values of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) during the study and maximal increases were reached 12 months after therapy (+21%). From this time the increases mildly declined to +14% and +11.2% respectively at 18 and 24 months after therapy. No significant changes in triglycerides were observed as compared with baseline or placebo. No patient withdrew from the study because of adverse effects. No drug-related clinical or biochemical adverse side-effects were observed. Any adverse experiences reported were mild and transient; moreover, no significant differences were obtained when compared with those reported by the placebo group. The results indicate that policosanol administered for two years to patients with type II hypercholesterolaemia shows a maintained efficacy as well as very good safety and tolerability.",

This study investigated the oral toxicity of policosanol administered for 52 weeks to beagle dogs. Twenty-four beagle dogs (12 males and 12 females) were distributed randomly in 3 experimental groups (4 animals/group): a control and 2 treated groups receiving policosanol at 30 and 180 mg/kg daily (7 days/week) by gavage. No mortality was observed in any group. Overall, policosanol was well tolerated throughout the study and no toxic symptoms were observed. All groups showed similar weight gain and food consumption. Lipid profile determinations showed that policosanol decreased total cholesterol by 20% approximately from 8 to 52 weeks. Cholesterol-lowering effects did not wear off during the study, thus demonstrating the persistence of the effectiveness. Triglycerides and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) were not changed significantly. No blood biochemistry or histopathological disturbances attributable to treatment were observed. This study has shown that no drug-related toxicity was induced by policosanol administered up to 180 mg/kg/day for 52 weeks to beagle dogs. Since this dose is approximately 620 times higher than the maximal recommended therapeutic dose (20 mg/day) it indicates a good safety margin of this product.",

      "abstract": "Policosanol, administered orally, has shown a cholesterol-lowering effect in different experimental models. Because lipid-lowering therapy is administered chronically, it is necessary to know the effects of these drugs after long-term administration. 18 adult male Macaca arctoides monkeys were used to study the cholesterol-lowering effects and possible toxicity produced by oral administration of policosanol (0.25, 2.5 and 25 mg/kg) for 54 wk. After 8 wk, a significant reduction of serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was observed in policosanol-treated animals when compared with the controls; this effect persisted throughout the study. The animals' behavioural repertoire, physical condition, haematology and blood biochemistry, as well as spermiogram analysis and electrocardiography, were monitored during the study; ophthalmological and pathological anatomy examinations were performed at the end of the administration period. No drug-related toxicity was detected by any examination. The results gave further evidence of the marked and persistent cholesterol-lowering effects of policosanol that had been observed in different experimental models. There was a significant reduction of spontaneous aortic atherosclerotic lesions in treated animals compared with controls. Policosanol (0.25-25 mg/kg) administered orally for 54 wk brought about a persistent reduction in blood cholesterol levels and was very safe and well tolerated during long-term administration.",

      "abstract": "Policosanol is a mixture of aliphatic primary alcohols isolated and purified from sugar cane wax, that induces cholesterol-lowering effects in experimental models and human beings. When human lung fibroblasts were incubated with policosanol for 48 hours prior to the experiment, a dose dependent inhibition of 14C-acetate incorporation into total cholesterol was observed, whereas labeled mevalonate incorporation was not inhibited. Even when cholesterol synthesis was not strongly inhibited, low density lipoprotein (LDL) processing was markedly enhanced. Thus, LDL binding, internalization and degradation were significantly increased after policosanol treatment. In addition, despite the fact that'cholesterol generation was not inhibited at the lowest dose of policosanol assayed, LDL processing was significantly increased. The current data indicate that policosanol inhibits cholesterol synthesis at the earliest steps of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. On the other hand, this study suggests that the increase in LDL processing may be partially explained by the inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis, even though an sterol-independent mechanism might be responsible for the enhancement of LDL-receptor activity.",

Oral toxicity of policosanol was evaluated in a 12-month study in which doses from 0.5 to 500 mg/kg were given orally to Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (20/sex/group) daily. There was no treatment-related toxicity. Thus, effects on body weight gain, food consumption, clinical observations, blood biochemistry, hematology, organ weight ratios and histopathological findings were similar in control and treated groups. This study supports the wide safety margin of policosanol when administered chronically.",
