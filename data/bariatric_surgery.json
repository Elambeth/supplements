      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pregnant women with previous bariatric surgery are at increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) but many cannot safely tolerate the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Consensus recommendations advise self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) for GDM diagnosis, but diagnostic thresholds are unexplored in this population. STUDY OBJECTIVE: to assess the incidence of SMBG-defined GDM (fasting, 1-hr postprandial thresholds: 90, 140 mg/dl (5.3, 7.8 mmol/l)) after bariatric surgery, compared to the incidence of OGTT-defined GDM in women with risk factors for GDM but no history of bariatric surgery. DESIGN AND SETTING: patients with a history of bariatric surgery (n=24) were included in a retrospective service evaluation based at a single centre tertiary referral centre in England, with results compared to a national study of women at high risk of GDM but without a history of bariatric surgery (n=1308). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the incidence of GDM diagnosed according to SMBG vs OGTT. RESULTS: GDM incidence was 16/24 (66.7%; SMBG-defined) after bariatric surgery and 121/1308 (9.3%; OGTT-defined) in the control group, with the highest incidence rates seen after gastric bypass (85.7%). In women with previous bariatric surgery, HbA1c showed no association with GDM diagnosis, the requirement for treatment or offspring birthweight. CONCLUSIONS: SMBG at standard thresholds is not able to reliably diagnose GDM after bariatric surgery and is likely to over-diagnose GDM, especially after gastric bypass although small sample size limits generalisability of this study. Alternative diagnostic and prognostic markers are warranted for diagnosis of GDM after bariatric surgery."

      "abstract": "Bariatric surgery (BS) is an effective intervention for obesity, inducing significant neurobiological and gut microbiota changes that influence hunger, appetite, taste perception, and long-term metabolic health. This narrative review examines these alterations by analyzing recent findings from clinical and preclinical studies, including neuroimaging, microbiome sequencing, and hormonal assessments. BS modulates appetite-regulating hormones, reducing ghrelin while increasing glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY), leading to enhanced satiety and decreased caloric intake. Neuroimaging studies reveal structural and functional changes in brain regions involved in reward processing and cognitive control, contributing to reduced cravings and altered food choices. Additionally, BS reshapes the gut microbiota, increasing beneficial species such as Akkermansia muciniphila, which influence metabolic pathways through short-chain fatty acid production and bile acid metabolism. These findings highlight the complex interplay between the gut and the brain in post-surgical metabolic regulation. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for optimizing post-operative care, including nutritional strategies and behavioral interventions. Future research should explore how these changes impact long-term outcomes, guiding the development of targeted therapies to enhance the recovery and quality of life for BS patients."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Obesity is a major public health challenge of the 21st century, with prevalence rates steadily rising globally. Disordered eating behaviors, particularly emotional eating (EE), complicate the clinical management of obesity and hinder long-term outcomes, such as maintaining weight loss after bariatric surgery. Studies reveal that EE affects 65-75% of overweight or obese adults, and such behavior may stem from a disrupted brain reward system linked to emotional dysregulation and impulsivity. Impulsivity in obesity involves deficient cognitive inhibitory control, creating an imbalance between impulsive and reflective systems. While problematic eating behaviors and obesity are well studied, the role of affective temperaments-innate traits influencing mood, energy, and responses to stimuli-remains underexplored. This study aims to examine the interplay between emotional eating, impulsivity, and affective temperaments in obese patients preparing for bariatric surgery. Methods: A total sample of 304 obese outpatients was consecutively enrolled at the Psychiatry Clinic of the Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine of the University of Pisa during the presurgical mental health evaluation routinely performed before the bariatric intervention. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected by psychiatrists during a single consultation. Assessments also included the following psychometric tests: the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID-5), the Emotional Eating Scale (EES), the Barratt Impulsivity Scale-Version 11 (BIS-11), and the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris, and San Diego-Auto-questionnaire (TEMPS-A). Results: A significant correlation was observed between the EES total score and the BIS total score (p = 0.003), as well as with the sub-dimensions of attentional impulsivity (p < 0.001) and motor impulsivity (p = 0.024). In addition, a significant correlation has been found between the total score of EES and the cyclothymic (p < 0.001), depressive (p < 0.001), irritable (p = 0.013), and anxious (0.020) temperaments. When comparing obese patients with EE and without EE (No-EE), higher rates of both current (p = 0.007) and lifetime (p = 0.024) psychiatric comorbidities were observed in the EE group, namely for anxiety disorders (p = 0.008) and eating disorders (p = 0.014). Conclusions: Our study highlights a significant association between EE in obese patients with the cyclothymic, irritable, anxious, and depressive temperaments, and impulsivity dimension. Thus, problematic eating behaviors and temperamental traits may have a bidirectional psychopathological influence in obese patients and need to be carefully evaluated in subjects seeking bariatric surgery."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for patients with obesity. After surgery, lifelong follow-up care is recommended to improve weight-loss outcomes. However, follow-up attendance is low, and the reasons have yet to be determined. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify patients' expectations and perspectives on follow-up care after bariatric surgery to identify current unmet needs and ways to increase follow-up attendance. METHODS: Patients who underwent bariatric surgery at a university medical center and attended at least one follow-up appointment completed an online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of open-ended questions regarding follow-up care. Content analysis was applied to qualitatively analyze the results. RESULTS: In total, 164 patients responded to at least one question (participation rate 50.1%). On average, patients had attended three follow-up appointments at the time of the study. Expectations concerning the content of follow-up care included regular examinations, blood tests, and psychological and nutritional counseling and support. Notably, the follow-up care was most criticized for its lack of regular psychological and nutritional support, with many suggesting that these services be incorporated. Interestingly, follow-up care appointment attendance was rarely connected with expectations of better outcomes. Regular appointments and laboratory results were among the positive aspects of the current follow-up care. CONCLUSIONS: Expectations were mostly related to the content of follow-up care. However, few patients seemed to recognize the importance of follow-up care for improved outcomes. Therefore, educating patients about the critical role of follow-up care might improve attendance and also lead to more successful long-term bariatric surgery outcomes."

Guidelines highlight the importance of long-term post-bariatric surgery follow-up. However, in the UK, there is currently no specific funding to support the delivery of this care. Our aim was to understand the views and experiences of healthcare professionals (HCPs) around long-term post-bariatric surgery follow-up, and barriers and enablers to care. Semi-structured interviews with HCPs in UK primary care or specialist weight management services were conducted. The topic guide was theoretically informed by the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behaviour model and the Theoretical Domains Framework. Thematic analysis was undertaken. Twenty-six HCPs were interviewed. Three core themes were interpreted: Existing Challenges, Mediating Factors and Future Directions. While there was agreement on the need for long-term support, current provision was variable and hampered by a paucity of referral options. Follow-up care could be contingent upon the patients' surgical pathway and the culture and expertise within the general practitioner surgery. Participants discussed potential ways to improve care, including using technology, adapting approaches used in other chronic conditions, shared care models and harnessing the potential for peer-based support to improve wellbeing and quality of life. Healthcare professionals' views and experiences shared in this study highlight the complex issues associated with long-term bariatric surgery follow-up. The findings will inform future research to design and implement care pathways that are urgently needed to improve service provision for these patients."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the outcomes of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) in patients with prior fundoplication. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Obesity and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) often coexist, posing clinical challenges. Fundoplication is the standard treatment for GERD refractory to medical therapy. Managing obesity after fundoplication is complex and while RYGB is preferred for addressing both obesity and GERD, its use post-fundoplication requires further evaluation. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a national French database of patients undergoing RYGB and SG between 2013 and 2023. Patients were grouped according to prior fundoplication (PriorF) or no fundoplication (NoF). Baseline demographics and 90-day postoperative outcomes were assessed. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified risk factors; 1:5 matching was applied based on sex, age, body mass index, comorbidities, surgery year, procedure type and center volume. RESULTS: Among 372,464 patients, 337 (0.1%) had prior fundoplication. PriorF patients had higher rates of severe postoperative complications (Dindo ≥IIIa: 8.9% vs. 3.7%, P < 0.001), longer hospital stays (4.5 ± 4.9 vs. 3.7 ± 2.9 d, P < 0.001), and higher readmission rates (17.8% vs. 10.6%, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis for RYGB showed no significant association between prior fundoplication and complications (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.00-2.74, P=0.051). Prior fundoplication was independently associated with increased complications after SG (OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.37-4.32, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Prior fundoplication increased postoperative complications after SG but not after RYGB. RYGB appears to be the safer bariatric procedure in patients with prior fundoplication."

      "abstract": "Bariatric surgery is a recognised intervention for severe obesity, a global epidemic associated with numerous comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. Procedures such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass facilitate significant weight loss, improving metabolic health and quality of life. However, these surgeries carry hidden costs, particularly concerning nutritional deficiencies that are often overlooked in preoperative assessments. This case report presents a 27-year-old patient who, after undergoing gastric sleeve surgery, developed neurological symptoms due to thiamine deficiency. Thiamine, essential for energy metabolism, is crucial for neurological function, and its deficiency can lead to serious conditions like Wernicke's encephalopathy and polyneuropathy. Despite the initial success of the surgery, the patient faced significant morbidity due to this oversight. The report emphasises the need for rigorous nutritional monitoring and proactive supplementation post-surgery. It advocates for comprehensive preoperative counselling that addresses potential deficiencies and their long-term implications. By recognising these hidden costs, healthcare providers can better prepare patients for effective long-term management, enhancing post-operative outcomes and improving the overall quality of life for those battling severe obesity."

This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the efficacy of bariatric surgery in BD/SCZ patients, aiming to inform clinical decisions and optimize treatment strategies for this population. MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched up to September 2024. A restricted maximum likelihood random-effects model with mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes and odds ratios (ORs) for binary outcomes, along with 95% confidence intervals (CI), was used. 13 studies involving 19,662 patients, of whom 1,117 (5.7%) were diagnosed with BD or SCZ, were included. The analysis revealed no significant differences in %TWL or BMI change at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. BD/SCZ patients showed a significantly smaller %EWL at 6 months; however, the differences at 1 and 2 years were no longer statistically significant. Similarly, no differences were found between BD/SCZ patients and controls regarding adherence to 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year follow-up, as well as 1-year remission rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, dyslipidemia, or 30-day readmission and reoperation rates. Data from included studies also indicated no exacerbation of psychiatric disorders after surgery. This study suggests that bariatric surgery may be similarly effective in patients with BD and SCZ, offering potential benefits for a population burdened with both psychiatric and physical health challenges."

      "abstract": "Bariatric surgery has long been the most effective intervention for obesity, providing significant and durable weight loss, with procedures like sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass achieving 10-year total weight loss (TWL) rates of 23.4% and 26.9%, respectively. More complex procedures, such as duodenal switch, result in even greater TWL. Recently, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) have emerged as a promising pharmacological alternative, demonstrating up to 25.3% TWL with tirzepatide. However, GLP-1 RA efficacy remains inferior to bariatric surgery, with high discontinuation rates due to adverse effects, cost, and limited insurance coverage. While surgery offers superior long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness, it is underutilized, with less than 1% of eligible patients undergoing surgical intervention annually. GLP-1 RA can expand access to obesity treatment, particularly for patients hesitant or ineligible for surgery, and may serve as a bridge to surgery or an adjunct for postoperative weight regain. Despite their benefits, GLP-1 RAs require sustained adherence, and weight regain is common upon discontinuation. A multidisciplinary approach integrating surgical, pharmacological, and lifestyle interventions is essential for optimizing obesity management. Future research should focus on long-term GLP-1 RA efficacy, combination therapy strategies, and improving access to both surgical and medical obesity treatments."

Still, it often also brings about complex psychological effects, including changes in self-esteem, body image and emotional well-being that require careful monitoring and support. This systematic review with meta-analysis aims to analyse the relationship between bariatric surgery and postoperative improvement in psychiatric and eating disorders. MEDLINE, EMBASE, COCHRANE Library and other specialized databases were searched in July 2024. Observational studies included individuals who had undergone any bariatric surgical treatment with a preoperative evaluation of eating disorders, depression and anxiety and at a postoperative measure of the same variables selected. Thirteen studies that met the eligibility criteria were included for qualitative synthesis and eight studies for meta-analysis. Two reviewers independently screened for eligibility. The mean difference was calculated using the random-effects model. Bariatric surgery was found to be effective in improving eating disorders (-0.81%, 95% CI -1.61 to -0.05; I2 = 98%, p < .05), depression (-0.56, 95% CI -1.09 to -0.04, I2 = 97%, p < .03) and anxiety (-0.74, 95% CI -1.17 to -0.31, I2 = 94%, p < .00). The literature reveals high heterogeneity between studies, particularly in assessing psychological factors, with a common reliance on self-reported questionnaires rather than gold-standard assessments. Nonetheless, based on the findings of this study, there was a genuine effect on eating disorders, depression and anxiety when those participants underwent bariatric surgery."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: A floating thrombus in the thoracic aorta represents a rare vascular condition frequently associated with morbidity and mortality. There is no standardised management approach, but options potentially include anticoagulation therapy, surgical intervention or a combination of these. Clinicians are increasingly selecting direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) due to predictable pharmacokinetics. Here, we present a 37-year-old female with a history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery for obesity, who was found to have an incidental floating thrombus in the thoracic aorta during evaluation for generalised weakness and altered mentation following a recent COVID-19 infection. The patient was initially treated with intravenous heparin and subsequently transitioned to apixaban. Despite medication adherence, she presented two weeks later with worsening mental status and bilateral leg swelling. Repeat imaging revealed rupture of the thrombus, leading to right renal and bowel infarctions. The failure of anticoagulation was attributed to malabsorption secondary to her bariatric surgery. Despite aggressive interventions, the patient ultimately developed multisystem organ failure and succumbed to her illness. Literature suggests that DOACs may be less effective in post-bariatric patients due to altered pharmacokinetics. Due to the absence of clinical guidelines for post-bariatric patients, we recommend full-dose anticoagulation with warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, to enable therapeutic international normalised ratio (INR) monitoring and necessary dose adjustments. DOACs are less effective in this population, particularly in hypercoagulable states, and the lack of monitoring increases the risk of treatment failure and subsequent life-threatening complications. This case report is of apixaban treatment failure in a female patient with a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. LEARNING POINTS: There is no established management of floating aortic mural thrombus detected by computed tomography.The efficacy of oral anticoagulants after bariatric surgery is uncertain."

This study aims to analyze the factors influencing referrals for MBS, focusing on the impact of obesity bias and stigma among primary care physicians. A survey questionnaire was sent electronically to 250 physicians across four regions in Algeria. The questionnaire evaluated their knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, and practices regarding MBS including questions on indications for MBS, operative techniques, physicians' attitudes toward patients with obesity, and factors influencing patient referrals for MBS. Survey response rate was 37.2% (93/250 physicians), most physicians (89%) recognized obesity as a chronic disease, and majority (60%) of physicians were aware that hunger regulation centers are involuntary and located in the hypothalamus; 34.4% believed that lifestyle changes were sufficient to treat severe obesity. Significant knowledge gaps were observed regarding MBS indications, 83% expressed a willingness to help their patients achieve ideal weight, but only 10% of physicians referred patients for MBS. Many physicians showed negative attitudes toward patients with obesity, and 68% held stereotypes about obesity, attributing it to a lack of personal willpower. These stigmas may have contributed to the low referral rates for MBS. Additional barriers were economic barriers, such as the high cost of MBS and limited or absent insurance coverage. A lack of knowledge about metabolic/bariatric surgery, coupled with stigmatizing attitudes and economic constraints, hinders patient referrals for MBS, which is the most effective treatment for severe obesity. The study highlights the need for more education of primary care physicians, promoting an empathetic and interprofessional approach and implementing health policies that improve financial accessibility to MBS in Algeria."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS) is an effective treatment for obesity and obesity-related diseases, but long-term data on its outcomes remain limited, particularly in Poland. These data are crucial for understanding the durability of weight loss, trends in weight regain, and comorbidity remission, as well as for refining surgical techniques and improving long-term care. This study aims to evaluate the 10-year outcomes of MBS in Poland, focusing on weight loss and remission of obesity-related diseases in patients who completed follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study, named BARI-10-POL, analyzed 485 patients (mean age: 41.0 years, 71.5% female, median BMI: 43.4 kg/m²) who underwent laparoscopic MBS between 2008 and 2014 across five bariatric centers. Data collected included demographics, type of surgery, weight loss (%TWL, %EWL), and remission of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hypertension (HT). RESULTS: The follow-up rate was 28.5% (485/1703). Among the procedures, 317 (65.4%) were sleeve gastrectomies (SG). The median %EWL and %TWL were 59.2% and 22.8%, respectively. Revisional procedures were required in 23.9% of patients, most commonly after SG (24.3%) and adjustable gastric banding (100%). The remission rates for T2D and HT were 70.8% and 56.7%, respectively. One anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) demonstrated superior median %EWL (80.1%) compared to SG (55.0%, p < 0.001) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) (51.4%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Conducting long-term follow-up after bariatric surgery is challenging. MBS leads to significant long-term outcomes in both weight loss and remission of obesity-related diseases.",

The article reviews the complex pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the link between obesity and HTN, including neurohormonal activation, inflammation, insulin resistance, and endothelial dysfunction. The role of adipokines, specifically leptin and adiponectin, in blood pressure regulation is highlighted, along with the impact of advanced glycation end-products on vascular function. We discuss the effectiveness of lifestyle therapies, including weight loss, and diet for the management of obesity HTN. We also discuss the utilization of pharmacologic agents, including GLP-1 receptor agonists, and the impact of bariatric surgery on long-term blood pressure control. Despite enhanced treatment, significant barriers to treatment exist, including obesity stigma, limited access to health care, and adherence problems. Future research must focus on personalized approaches, like pharmacogenomics, to optimize hypertension treatment in the obese."

      "abstract": "Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) is a neurological disorder characterized by elevated intracranial pressure without definitive etiology, primarily affecting young, obese women. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of bariatric surgery versus conventional community weight management in treating IIH. We conducted a retrospective cohort study in IIH patients undergoing bariatric procedures versus conventional weight loss interventions. Propensity score matching was employed to balance study groups. Outcomes were assessed at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, including papilledema, headache, visual symptoms, and therapeutic interventions. Bariatric surgery demonstrated superior outcomes compared to community weight management. Papilledema incidence was consistently lower in the bariatric group (RR = 0.591 at 24 months, p = 0.0001). Headache prevalence and visual symptoms were also reduced in the surgical group. Acetazolamide dose was lower in bariatric patients, starting at 12 and 24 months. Subgroup analysis of different bariatric procedures showed comparable efficacy. Body mass index reduction was significantly greater in the bariatric group throughout the follow-up period. This study provides evidence supporting the efficacy of bariatric surgery in managing IIH, with superior outcomes across multiple parameters compared to conventional weight management. The sustained improvements in papilledema, headache, and visual symptoms, coupled with for the reduction in pharmacological intervention dose, suggest that bariatric surgery may offer a more definitive solution for IIH patients with concurrent obesity. Further research is needed to develop evidence-based guidelines for patient selection and optimize post-operative care protocols.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Bariatric surgery is widely recognized as a mainstay in the treatment of obesity; however, there is limited information regarding its success and the factors that influence outcomes within the Mexican population. This study provides an analysis of bariatric surgery outcomes at the \"Hospital de Especialidades\" of the \"Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI,\" with a particular focus on the prevalence of suboptimal initial clinical response, weight regain, and the identification of predictive factors. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study involving 132 patients who underwent bariatric surgery between January 2018 and March 2023 was conducted. The prevalence of suboptimal initial clinical response was determined, and a binary logistic regression was applied to identify potential risk factors. RESULTS: The study found that 21.97% of patients experienced suboptimal initial clinical response, a rate lower than reported in global literature. The population exhibited a significant prevalence of comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (63.64%), hypertension (55.3%), and obstructive sleep apnea (60.61%), reflecting Mexico's high obesity rates. Additionally, male sex was identified as a significant predictor of suboptimal initial clinical response, while glycated hemoglobin and serum albumin emerged as relevant biochemical predictors, underscoring the importance of preoperative glycemic control. CONCLUSION: These findings offer valuable insights into bariatric surgery outcomes and identifies adequate preoperative glycemic control as an important modifiable factor that can inform future policies aimed at enhancing patient care and surgical success in bariatric procedures.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bariatric surgery is currently the most effective approach to addressing severe obesity and reducing related health issues. Laparoscopy remains the standard technique, whereas robotic-assisted surgery is increasingly adopted, although its role in bariatric surgery remains debated. The main criticism concerns its higher costs and the lack of evidence demonstrating improved clinical outcomes compared to other treatment methods. We aimed to compare the costs of robotic-assisted and laparoscopic bariatric surgery through a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Following PRISMA reporting guidelines, a literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for studies comparing robotic-assisted and laparoscopic bariatric surgery. The primary outcome was total hospital costs, with bias assessed using the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool. Effect sizes were calculated with 95% confidence intervals, and an overall effect was estimated using a random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 14 retrospective studies (293 articles screened) were included, with 1,414,357 patients (112,363 robotic; 1,301,994 laparoscopic). Total hospital costs favored laparoscopic surgery (SMD 0.721, 95%CI: 0.555-0.887, p < 0.001, absolute difference USD 3819). Operating room costs also favored laparoscopy (SMD 1.339, 95%CI 0.202-2.476, p = 0.021, absolute difference: USD 9746). Laparoscopy was associated with shorter operative time, while robotic surgery showed a slight advantage in hospital stay and complication rates. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were consistent with the main findings. The quality of evidence was rated as low due to potential biases. CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review and meta-analysis provides the most current and robust evidence indicating that the robotic-assisted approach incurs significantly higher costs than the laparoscopic approach in bariatric surgery. This finding remained consistent across the overall analysis as well as in nearly all subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Randomized controlled trials are warranted to accurately evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the robotic approach in both primary and revisional bariatric procedures.",

However, there is uncertainty regarding what intervention components, delivery methods and intensity are effective. To understand how intervention effects are achieved, we performed a process evaluation of a 15-session pre- and post-MBS programme comprising medical, dietary and psychological interventions delivered via group sessions until 9 months postsurgery. The evaluation examined programme relevance, perceived fit and practicability ('appropriateness') and satisfaction with content and delivery ('acceptability'). Interviews (n = 11) and focus groups (n = 2) were performed with 21 patients in different programme phases. Programme fidelity was assessed using administrative data on attendance in 1.396 patients. Presurgery, practicing with postoperative recommendations and multiple social components, was described as useful. Although participants found several postoperative components helpful (e.g. meal planning), the perceived fit was lower due to group delivery, session spacing and varying needs. Attended programme time postsurgery was lower than presurgery. Individual needs varied in terms of support intensity and type, and by gender, age and surgery type. Participants recommended greater session spacing, as maintaining behaviours >1 year postsurgery was expected to be most challenging. Participants requested additional information on negative lived experiences, exercise and coping with various postoperative changes. Programme fit can be improved by taking patients' varying needs into account in a flexible programme, with a duration beyond the first postoperative year, and more attention to negative lived experiences, exercise and coping with changes."

      "abstract": "Bariatric surgery, while effective for severe obesity, is often challenged by postoperative weight regain (WR), affecting 20-30% of patients. This review analyzes the mechanisms, risk factors, and management strategies for WR, emphasizing surgical considerations. WR is influenced by hormonal adaptations, including ghrelin rebound and leptin resistance, as well as metabolic adaptation, leading to reduced resting energy expenditure. Surgical factors, such as suboptimal technique, gastro-gastric fistulas, and stomach/anastomosis dilation, significantly contribute to WR. Specifically, inaccurate sleeve or pouch sizing, poorly calibrated anastomoses, and complications with gastric banding necessitate careful surgical planning and potential revision. Management strategies encompass lifestyle interventions (diet, exercise, behavioral therapy), pharmacotherapy (GLP-1 receptor agonists like liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide), and revisional surgery. Revisional procedures, including sleeve-to-bypass, bypass revision, sleeve-to-duodenal switch/SADI, and band removal with conversion to sleeve or bypass, address anatomical failures and enhance weight loss. Distinguishing surgical failure from patient nonadherence is crucial for appropriate intervention. Ultimately, a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach integrating these strategies optimizes long-term weight management and improves patient outcomes after bariatric surgery."

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA) and bariatric surgery (BS) are effective weight loss interventions; however, the genetic factors influencing treatment response remain largely unexplored. Moreover, most previous studies have focused on race and ethnicity rather than genetic ancestry. Here we analyzed 10,960 individuals from 9 multiancestry biobank studies across 6 countries to assess the impact of known genetic factors on weight loss. Between 6 and 12 months, GLP1-RA users had an average weight change of -3.93% or -6.00%, depending on the outcome definition, with modest ancestry-based differences. BS patients experienced -21.17% weight change between 6 and 48 months. We found no significant associations between GLP1-RA-induced weight loss and polygenic scores for body mass index or type 2 diabetes, nor with missense variants in GLP1R. A higher body mass index polygenic score was modestly linked to lower weight loss after BS (+0.7% per s.d., P = 1.24 × 10-4), but the effect attenuated in sensitivity analyses. Our findings suggest known genetic factors have limited impact on GLP1-RA effectiveness with respect to weight change and confirm treatment efficacy across ancestry groups."

This systematic review aims to comprehensively analyze the diagnosis and management strategies for GCF following MBS. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and EMBASE were searched until March 2024. Studies were independently screened and extracted using the PRISMA checklist. This systematic review included 16 studies (13 case reports and three retrospective cohort studies). GCF was most prevalent in laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), accounting for 81.2% of the studies. The transverse colon was the most common site of occurrence. Exploratory laparoscopy was utilized as the final treatment or rescue surgery in 85.7% of GCF case report studies, with all patients successfully healed following these interventions. The time from diagnosis to closure of the GCF varied significantly: in acute studies, closure occurred between 14 and 61 days, while in chronic studies, it ranged from 1 to 12 months. This systematic review concludes that surgical intervention should be recommended for managing GCF following specific staple line leaks in LSG. Most GCF studies occurred more than 6 months post-surgery, indicating a late complication. Computed tomography (CT) was the most frequently used diagnostic tool. Although over-the-scope clips (OTSC) and stents were employed, their efficacy as primary treatments remain questionable due to limited and inconsistent study outcomes."

We report an observational, longitudinal study investigating prevalence of post-surgical FA at 5 and 10 years following MBS. METHODS: Participants in the Oslo Bariatric Surgery Study (OBSS) completed the modified Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0 (mYFAS) and measures of psychological functioning and weight outcomes (% total weight loss: %TWL and % weight recurrence: %WR) at 5 and 10 years follow-up. RESULTS: N = 173 of 224 (23% lost-to-follow-up) participants (73% women, 93.6% Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) completed the mYFAS 2.0 at 5 years and 10 years following MBS. The prevalence of FA was 12.9% at 5 years and 8.4% at 10 years after MBS. A higher number of FA symptoms at 5 years significantly predicted less %TWL and lower psychological functioning at 10 years. At 10 years, the majority of individuals with FA had moderate or severe symptoms and 3% were new-onset cases of FA. Higher FA at 10 years was concurrently associated with less %TWL, greater %WR, and lower psychological functioning at the 10-year follow-up (p's < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of FA decreased from 12.9 to 8.4% between 5 and 10 years following MBS. We observed prospective and concurrent associations between FA symptoms and poorer weight loss and mental health outcomes. The presence of post-operative FA may be an important target for continued assessment and follow-up care to improve longer-term outcomes."

Alterations in gut microbiota may significantly contribute to these metabolic improvements. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review was aimed at evaluating changes in gut microbiota composition before and after bariatric surgery and their association with clinical outcomes, including weight loss, insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism. METHODS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and clinicaltrials.gov databases was conducted for studies published between 2004 and 2024. Keywords included \"bariatric surgery,\" \"gut microbiota\" and \"obesity.\" Inclusion criteria focused on human studies with pre and post-surgical microbiota analysis. Non-human studies, pediatric populations and studies without microbiota assessment were excluded. Data extraction covered microbiota profiles, metabolic outcomes and clinical markers. RESULTS: Total 27 articles and 28 clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. Pre-surgery, obese patients exhibited dysbiosis characterized by reduced microbial diversity and imbalances in key bacterial phyla. Post-surgery, especially after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG), patients showed increased microbial diversity, reduced Firmicutes and elevated beneficial bacteria such as Akkermansia muciniphila and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producing bacteria. These microbiota changes were correlated with significant improvements in weight loss, insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles. However, some studies reported inconsistent or modest microbiota changes. CONCLUSION: Bariatric surgery leads to significant gut microbiota alterations that are closely linked to metabolic improvements, including enhanced glucose control and lipid metabolism. However, the long-term sustainability of these microbial changes remains unclear. Longitudinal studies are essential to determine whether these alterations persist over time and how they continuously impact metabolic health. Further research should explore targeted microbiota interventions to maintain beneficial microbial profiles post-surgery."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment option for individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, whether outcomes in subtypes of individuals at risk for T2D and/or comorbidities (Tübingen Clusters) differ, is unknown. Of these, cluster 5 (C5) and cluster 6 (C6) are high-risk clusters for developing T2D and/or comorbidities, while cluster 4 (C4) is a low-risk cluster. We investigated bariatric surgery outcomes, hypothesizing that high-risk clusters benefit most due to great potential for metabolic improvement. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We allocated participants without T2D but at risk for T2D, defined by elevated BMI, to the Tübingen Clusters. Participants had normal glucose regulation or prediabetes according to American Diabetes Association criteria. Two cohorts underwent bariatric surgery: a discovery (Lille, France) and a replication cohort (Rome, Italy). A control cohort (Tübingen, Germany) received behavioral modification counseling. Main outcomes included alteration of glucose regulation parameters and prediabetes remission. RESULTS: In the discovery cohort, 15.0% of participants (n = 121) were allocated to C4, 22.3% (n = 180) to C5, and 62.4% (n = 503) to C6. Relative body weight loss was similar among all clusters; however, reduction of insulin resistance and improvement of β-cell function were strongest in C5. Prediabetes remission rate was lowest in low-risk C4 and highest in high-risk C5. Individuals from high-risk clusters changed to low-risk clusters in both bariatric surgery cohorts but not in the control cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Participants in C5 had the highest benefit from bariatric surgery in terms of improvement in insulin resistance, β-cell function, and prediabetes remission. This novel classification might help identify individuals who will benefit specifically from bariatric surgery."

We studied the odds of 90-day postoperative complications by comparing TJA patients who had a history of bariatric surgery to a control group. METHODS: There were 678 patients who had undergone bariatric surgery before TJA (199 total hip arthroplasty [THA], 479 total knee arthroplasty [TKA]) matched 1:4 for body mass index (BMI) at the time of TJA, age, sex, replaced joint, and American Society of Anesthesiologists Class with a control group of 2,301 TJA (644 THA, 1,657 TKA) patients who did not have bariatric surgery. Matching was performed using propensity scores with refined calipers to ensure comparability. The 90-day complication data was collected through chart review. The primary outcome was the incidence of Hip Society or Knee Society complications, emergency department visits, and wound complications requiring deviation from the standard of care. RESULTS: There were significantly more complications in the THA study than in the control group (11.6 and 6.3%, respectively, P = 0.018). The THA study group demonstrated 1.96 times higher odds of developing complications compared to controls (95% CI [confidence interval] 1.12 to 3.43). There were similar rates of complications in the study and control TKA groups (12.4 and 10.1%, respectively, P = 0.129). Wound-related complications were more common in the THA study group affecting 4.5 and 1.4% of study and control patients, respectively (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: While Bariatric surgery remains an effective weight loss intervention, its utility as a risk-reduction strategy before THA is not supported by our findings."

This report aims to advance understanding of the complex relationship between EDs and MBS by highlighting recent empirical evidence and identifying areas for future research. RECENT FINDINGS: Little-to-no empirical evidence suggests that EDs be considered an absolute contraindication for MBS. However, a small subset of patients experience recurrent or emergent ED symptoms following surgery, invariably resulting in poorer postsurgical outcomes. Plausibly, a confluence of psychosocial and neurobiological mechanisms explains post-MBS ED symptoms. Accurate identification of MBS-related ED concerns is essential, with growing evidence suggesting structured postsurgical treatment may be optimal. Despite recent advances, more research on EDs in the context of MBS is needed, including rigorous mechanistic studies with long-term follow-up that clarify how predisposing factors interact to precipitate postsurgical ED symptoms. More work is also required to inform design and dissemination of targeted ED interventions for patients pursuing MBS.",

      "abstract": "Bariatric surgery has emerged as a promising intervention for obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition strongly associated with obesity and anovulatory infertility. While weight management is a key therapeutic strategy, the optimal approach remains uncertain. A recent randomized controlled trial evaluated the impact of bariatric surgery on ovulation rates in obese women with PCOS. However, methodological limitations, including baseline body mass index discrepancies and minimal weight loss in the medical management group, necessitate cautious interpretation of the findings. To further investigate this issue, we conducted a prospective cohort study involving 192 women with PCOS who had undergone bariatric surgery. We assessed 30 reproductive and metabolic parameters at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Most metabolic parameters improved significantly by 3 months postsurgery but plateaued thereafter, with only triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol showing continued improvement. Reproductive outcomes demonstrated sustained improvements in ovulatory dysfunction, coinciding with a reduction in luteinizing hormone levels. However, testosterone levels and polycystic ovarian morphology showed limited improvement, while anti-Müllerian hormone levels remained unchanged. Despite the total weight loss exceeding 30%, further weight reduction did not proportionally enhance outcomes. These findings suggest that while bariatric surgery effectively improves metabolic health and ovulation in PCOS, its long-term hormonal and ovarian effects remain unclear and require further investigation. Head-to-head comparisons with emerging therapies are also urgently needed to refine weight management strategies for this high-risk population."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: While previous research has evaluated surgical outcomes following open carpal tunnel release (CTR) in obese patients, there is relatively minimal literature regarding outcomes in patients who have previously undergone bariatric surgery prior to open CTR. The purpose of this study is to compare the postoperative functional and surgical outcomes in patients who undergo open CTR with or without a history of bariatric surgery. METHODS: Adult patients with a documented history of bariatric surgery undergoing open CTR surgery between 2015 and 2022 were propensity matched with control open CTR patients with no bariatric surgery history. Patients were matched based on age, sex, race, body mass index (BMI), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), smoking status, and history of diabetes mellitus. A retrospective chart review was performed to collect demographic data, preoperative nerve conduction studies (NCS), surgical characteristics, complications, further treatment, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). RESULTS: A total of 42 patients having undergone bariatric surgery prior to CTR and 84 control CTR patients with no history of bariatric surgery were included. More bariatric surgery patients demonstrated mild carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) on preoperative NCS. The overall minor complication rate was similar between patients with and without bariatric surgery history. There were no differences in postoperative Physical Component score (PCS-12) and Mental Component score (MCS-12) as well as no change in PCS-12 scores (ΔPCS-12) between preoperative and one-year postoperative scores. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a history of bariatric surgery tended to have a larger benefit from open CTR in comparison to the control cohort; however, this was not statistically significant. The current literature regarding CTR outcomes as it relates to obesity and bariatric surgery is limited, and therefore, the association should be explored further with larger patient cohorts."

However, surgery alone, without additional behavior change management, may not lead to optimal long-term weight loss and maintenance. This study aimed to evaluate an intervention designed based on the Health Action Process Approach to improve outcomes of obesity surgery in patients who underwent bariatric surgery in Tehran, Iran. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, a total of 100 patients who had undergone bariatric surgery after the past year were randomly assigned to two intervention (n = 50) and control (n = 50) groups. The intervention group received educational intervention for two months. Health action process approach (HAPA) constructs, the Bariatric Surgery Self-Management Behaviors Questionnaire (BSSQ), dietary recall, blood chemistry parameters, BMI, percentage of body weight loss, and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAC) were measured at baseline and four months after the intervention. To compare the changes between the two groups before and four months after the educational intervention, the interaction of group and time was analyzed using the generalized estimating equation (GEE). A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The educational intervention resulted in improvements in various aspects of self-efficacy, including task and coping self-efficacy constructs (P = 0.02), action planning (P < 0.01) and behavioral intention (P < 0.01) related to diet self-management. There were also statistically significant improvements in action planning (P = 0.02), risk perception (P = 0.01) and Recovery self- efficacy (P = 0.01) related to the self-management of physical activity. There were significant improvements in the iron blood test results (P =  0.01) among the patients. CONCLUSION: Our intervention, designed based on the Health Action Process Approach, led to improvements in dietary and physical activity outcomes among patients who underwent bariatric surgery.

While effective, these approaches can result in complications, including Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), a rare but serious autoimmune disorder. This study aims to analyze clinical and neurophysiological features of diet-induced GBS and compare them to cases linked with bariatric surgery. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of five patients admitted to our institution between August 2012 and August 2022, who developed GBS during active dieting resulting in significant weight loss. Clinical presentations, laboratory results, neurophysiological findings, and nutritional status during treatment were analyzed. Additionally, we performed a literature review comparing these cases with nineteen previously reported instances of bariatric surgery-associated GBS. RESULTS: All five patients exhibited acute, symmetrical limb weakness primarily affecting the lower extremities, accompanied by diminished tendon reflexes. Neurophysiological assessments revealed axonal damage in all cases, and albuminocytologic dissociation was present in two patients. Three patients received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy, while the remaining two underwent nutritional therapy alone. All patients achieved full recovery within 6 months. Notably, the rate of weight loss observed significantly exceeded recommended safe guidelines. DISCUSSION: Rapid and substantial weight loss may play a role in triggering GBS, possibly due to nutritional deficiencies or immune dysregulation. Clinicians should recognize the potential neurological risks associated with aggressive weight-loss strategies. Early diagnosis and appropriate intervention are crucial for favorable outcomes and preventing complications."

The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of 12 months of GLP1-RA treatment in a real-world patient population with weight regain after bariatric surgery. METHODS: A single-centre retrospective observational study. Patients with post-bariatric weight regain subsequently treated with GLP1-RA were identified, and the effect on weight after 12 months of treatment was determined. Data are presented as medians (interquartile ranges) or frequencies (%), and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for paired and nonpaired group comparisons, respectively. RESULTS: Forty patients (80% female) were included in the analysis. Liraglutide (3.0 mg, daily subcutaneous injection, n = 22) or semaglutide (1.0 mg, weekly subcutaneous injection, n = 18) was started 74.5 (51.0, 108.3) months after surgery following a weight regain of 14.7 (10.3, 19.6)%. After 12 months of GLP1-RA treatment, a total body weight, BMI, and percentage excess body weight reduction of 10.5 (6.1, 14.7) kg, 3.7 (2.5, 5.3) kg/m2, and 41.7 (22.1, 70.5)% were observed, corresponding to a loss of 99.3 (61.0, 135.4)% of the weight regained (P-value < 0.0001). The observed reduction in BMI was significantly lower with liraglutide than with semaglutide, 3.1 (2.0, 4.7) vs. 4.7 (3.7, 6.0) kg/m2 (P-value = 0.04). Adverse events were reported in 13 (32.5%) patients, all of which were mild and transient.

This overview of reviews was conducted to create a single cohesive resource to aid clinicians and researchers by exploring the effects of pre- and post-operative exercise training on health outcomes. A literature search of 7 electronic databases was performed (updated 09/2023) and 24 reviews met preset PICOS eligibility criteria and were included: 4 exploring preoperative exercise training, 13 postoperative, and 7 both. Comparing reviews, outcome results were organized as concordant, discordant, or inconclusive, and then categorized into \"what we currently know\", \"what we think we know\" and \"what we still don't know\". We do not currently know the effects of pre- or post-operative exercise training on any outcomes, but we think we know that preoperative exercise training has a positive effect on BMI and 6-minute walking test distance, and postoperative exercise training has a positive effect on body weight and BMI, waist circumference, bone mineral density, 6-minute walking test distance, muscle strength, and systolic blood pressure. Despite the abundance of research, much still needs to be done in terms of enhancing methodological rigor and reporting to achieve greater confidence in our conclusions; recommendations for the next research steps are made."

OBJECTIVES: We wished to report the outcomes following MBS in patients with VADs in a contemporary North American cohort. SETTING: Accredited MBSAQIP centers in United States and Canada in 2022. METHODS: We used the 2022 MBSQIP participant user file (PUF) to identify all patients who had a preoperative ventricular assist device. We reported the baseline characteristics, hospitalization course, 30-day complications, and weight loss outcomes. We performed 1:1 nearest neighbor Mahalanobis distance matching without replacement to identify patients with similar comorbidities, and used g-computation to estimate the independent effect of VAD therapy on key outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 120 patients undergoing MBS with a history of VAD, 78 underwent sleeve gastrectomy and 17, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The median postoperative length of stay was 2 days, and with 119 patients surviving to hospital discharge, the overall 30-day risk of death was .8%. There were no recorded pulmonary embolism, stroke, cardiac arrest, or myocardial infarction events. Compared to their matched counterparts, VAD patients had an increased risk of length of stay >7 days (risk ratio 1.40, 95% CI: .91-2.14) and required more units of blood transfusion (mean difference .19, 95% CI: .06-.32). VAD therapy was not statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of death (risk ratio 1.04, 95% CI .76-1.42). CONCLUSIONS: Early outcomes after bariatric surgery in patients with VADs suggest feasibility and safety. Larger studies with well-defined selection criteria and longer term follow up are needed to confirm these results."

      "abstract": "Obesity is a pandemic that affects nearly a third of the world's population, and its medical treatment has not achieved satisfactory or sustained results over time. Its counterpart, bariatric surgery (BS), has seen significant growth in recent years due to its favorable outcomes in weight loss and the resolution of comorbidities associated with obesity. Changes in diet, associated with the anatomical and physiological alterations resulting from BS, can lead to complications such as protein-calorie malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. Therefore, non-specialist physicians must be informed about these potential issues to ensure timely diagnosis and proper treatment. In this literature review, based on our center's years of experience as a national reference in bariatric surgery, we present the main nutritional complications associated with BS.",

The lack of useful and standardized tools makes the follow-up of these patients more difficult. The Eating Behavior after Bariatric Surgery (EBBS) questionnaire was designed to assess adherence to post-surgical lifestyle recommendations, which may predict successful weight maintenance. This study aimed to adapt the EBBS for Spanish-speaking patients and evaluate its utility in assessing adherence to long-term lifestyle changes and its association with weight outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 100 patients who underwent a sleeve gastrectomy (mean follow-up 90.4 ± 46 months) were included. The EBBS was administered to evaluate food, drink, behavior, and lifestyle domains. RESULTS: Significant weight regain was observed in 70% of participants, and emotional eating (65%) and depression (53%) were common. The EBBS demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.662). Higher total EBBS scores were significantly associated with greater excess weight loss (EWL), particularly for patients maintaining over 50% EWL (p = 0.04). Logistic regression revealed that EBBS scores > 13.5 predicted EWL > 50% (OR = 17.8, p = 0.010), underscoring the value of this tool in identifying patients at risk for WR. CONCLUSIONS: The Spanish version of the EBBS is a reliable tool for assessing post-BS diet and lifestyle patterns and predicting long-term weight outcomes. Tailored interventions based on EBBS results may improve adherence to dietary and lifestyle recommendations, reducing the risk of WR."

Bariatric surgery offers better long-term weight loss and comorbidity resolution compared with any other treatments, with low morbidity and mortality rates. OBJECTIVE: This paper evaluates the efficacy, indications, outcomes and long-term considerations of bariatric surgery. It compares the current surgical procedures, SG, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB), along with alternative weight-loss treatments, focusing on the important aspects for an Australian general practitioner. DISCUSSION: Bariatric surgery remains the most effective treatment for people with obesity, initially achieving 30% total weight loss (TWL) with sustained long-term outcomes. Both SG and RYGB show similar TWL rates at five years (23.7% vs 27.2%). Complication rates are low (1.5-4.8%), and surgery significantly improves or resolves comorbidities, particularly diabetes. Endoscopic and pharmacological treatments are emerging alternatives but lack the long-term efficacy of surgery.",

Bariatric surgery has demonstrated long-term benefits in terms of weight loss and mortality rates, but barriers to its utilization persist. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of bariatric surgery on outcomes and cost-effectiveness among patients with obesity, focusing on those with cirrhosis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation was a retrospective cohort study including US veterans older than 18 years with a body mass index (BMI) higher than 35 or with a BMI higher than 30 and more than 1 major metabolic comorbidity. These veterans were referred to a structured lifestyle modification program (MOVE!), and a subset proceeded to bariatric surgery, including sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) from 2008 to 2020. Risk set matching was used to match bariatric surgery cases 1:5 with nonsurgical controls. Data were analyzed from September 2008 to September 2023. EXPOSURES: Bariatric surgery (SG or RYGB) or structured lifestyle intervention (MOVE!). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of SG or RYGB vs MOVE! over 10 years. Secondary outcomes included overall survival, quality-adjusted survival, and weight loss achieved. RESULTS: The final cohort included 4301 SG, 1906 RYGB, and 31 055 MOVE! participants, among whom 64, 8, and 354, respectively, had cirrhosis. The median (IQR) age of the cohort was 52 (44-59) years; there were 25 581 male patients (68.7%) and 11 681 female (31.3%). Compared with MOVE!, bariatric surgery was associated with longer observed survival (9.67 years vs 9.46 years overall; 9.09 years vs 8.23 years in cirrhosis). The ICER was $132 207 for SG and $159 027 for RYGB in the overall cohort, and $18 679 for SG and $44 704 for RYGB in the cirrhosis cohorts. Bariatric surgery was cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year among patients with cirrhosis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Bariatric surgery was associated with improved survival and expected weight loss and was cost-effective. These findings support the expanded use of bariatric surgery in appropriately selected patients, including those with cirrhosis, to improve outcomes and reduce long-term health care costs."

METHODS: The data for 3456 individuals who had bariatric surgery were obtained prospectively. A bioelectrical impedance analyzer was used to measure body composition changes and compare them between the sufficient (SWL) and IWL groups. The generalized estimated equation approach was used to assess changes in fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM), FFM loss/weight loss percentage (FFML/WL%), and excess weight loss percentage (EWL%). Multivariate logistic regression models were used for IWL to establish independent baseline factors. RESULTS: IWL was recorded in 8% of the cases. The data analysis revealed substantial differences in the changes in FM%, FFM%, FFML/WL%, and EWL% between the SWL and IWL groups after six months of follow-up. The IWL group demonstrated a greater FFML/WL% (Ptime before & after 6 months < 0.05). An older age, a higher baseline BMI, diabetes mellitus (DM), non-smoking, and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) were the predictors of IWL. CONCLUSION: the significant predictors of IWL included older age, a higher baseline BMI, DM, SG, and non-smoking.",

Pre-operatively, the MDT focused on optimizing the patient's metabolic status and surgical readiness. The patient, initially bedbound with comorbidities including type 2 diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea, achieved significant weight loss pre-surgery. Post-operatively, the patient followed bariatric diet phases and engaged in physical therapy, improving mobility from bedbound to walking 25 minutes with a walker. Over 1 year, the patient achieved 37% excess weight loss, reducing BMI to 66.79 kg/m2.

Addressing these gaps is essential for enhancing patient-centered care and supporting long-term outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To explore the long-term patient experiences of adolescents undergoing MBS. METHODS: A qualitative content analysis utilizing individual semi-structured interviews with 18 patients conducted a decade after MBS. RESULTS: The analysis identified three key categories: Enhanced daily life with the help of MBS, Support and routines, and Reflections on the decision to undergo MBS as an adolescent. Weight loss following MBS was described as pivotal in improving daily life due to enhanced physical, mental and social health. Participants emphasized the need for enhanced access to primary and specialist healthcare with appropriate knowledge of follow-up care. They also underscored the importance of identifying and treating concomitant neuropsychiatric and mental disorders prior to MBS. Additionally, informants highlighted the importance of psychosocial support to maintain the positive changes established post-surgery. CONCLUSIONS: A high level of satisfaction was expressed among those who had undergone MBS as an adolescent. The treatment was considered to help improve daily life and overall well-being and the majority would recommend MBS to others in comparable situations. However, participants highlighted the need for ongoing multidisciplinary support and acknowledged the challenges associated with life after MBS. Notably, a significant proportion of individuals did not attend regular medical follow-ups, emphasizing the importance of structured strategies to ensure adherence to postoperative care."

Treatment and high glycemia (fasting >125 mg/dL) before surgery reduce the relative probability of complete remission. • Weight loss as a predictor of complete remission shows high sensitivity and specificity (cutoff value = 37.5kg).",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Obesity is a global public health issue, and metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) remains most effective intervention for achieving and maintaining long-term weight loss. However, rapid weight loss following MBS increases the risk of gallstone formation. Concomitant cholecystectomy (CC) during MBS has been proposed to mitigate this risk, but recent studies present conflicting evidence regarding its safety and efficacy, leaving no clear consensus. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis by systematically searching MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov for studies comparing CC plus BS versus BS alone. Odds ratios (ORs) and mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using a random-effects model. Statistical analyses were performed with Review Manager v5.4 and RStudio v4.3.3. PROSPERO ID: CRD42023480360. RESULTS: We included 26 studies encompassing 656,830 patients with confirmed gallstones, among whom 34,409 (5.2%) underwent CC.The mean age was 41.5 years, and 79.2% were female. Patients undergoing CC + MBS had increased postoperative bleeding (OR 1.31; 95% CI 1.06-1.62; p = 0.01), wound complications (OR 1.61; 95% CI 1.34-1.95; p < 0.01), respiratory complications (OR 1.49; 95% CI 1.13-1.95; p < 0.01), and anastomotic complications (OR 1.86; 95% CI 1.28-2.70; p < 0.01). No significant differences in operation time, rates of postoperative mortality, length of hospital stay, and vein thrombosis were found between groups. CONCLUSION: CC during MBS increases operative time and postoperative complications, though only anastomotic complications are clinically significant. Therefore, CC should be reserved for high-risk or symptomatic patients and avoided in bariatric procedures involving an anastomosis due to the elevated risk of complications."

Bariatric surgery (BS) remains the most effective treatment for obesity, but early postoperative gastrointestinal complications may require additional surgical intervention. The objective of this study was to analyze gastrointestinal-related complications (GRCs) and their risk factors following BS, including sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), using a nationwide database. METHODS: An analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample data from 2010 to 2019 was conducted to compare patients following BS with versus without postoperative GRCs. Variables included demographics, hospital characteristics, length of stay, costs, comorbidities, and complications. Risk factors were identified through stepwise multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 323,066 BS patients, 12,248 (3.79%) developed GRCs, with a decreasing trend observed over the study period. Common complications included gastrointestinal bleeding (1.37%), bowel obstruction (1.84%), and anastomotic issues (0.99%). Significant risk factors included advanced age, anemia (deficiency and chronic blood loss), cardiovascular conditions (heart failure, valve disease, peripheral vascular disorders), coagulation abnormalities, rheumatoid arthritis or collagen vascular diseases, drug abuse, electrolyte imbalances, neurological conditions, renal failure, non-bleeding peptic ulcer disease, and weight loss. Interestingly, liver disease emerged as a risk factor for GRCs after SG while acting as a protective factor for GRCs after RYGB. CONCLUSION: Understanding the risk factors for GRCs after BS would allow for improved patient management and clinical outcomes."

Changes in adipose tissue during the development of metabolic disease are varied and complex, made all the more so by the heterogeneity of cell types within the tissue. Here we present detailed comparisons of atlases of murine WAT in the setting of diet-induced obesity, as well as after weight loss induced by either vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) or treatment with the GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide. We focus on identifying populations of cells that return to a lean-like phenotype versus those that persist from the obese state, and examine pathways regulated in these cell types across conditions. These data provide a resource for the study of the cell type changes in WAT during weight loss, and paint a clearer picture of the differences between adipose tissue from lean animals that have never been obese, versus those that have.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To determine how rates of discussion of metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) between patients with class 2 obesity and higher and their healthcare providers as well as subsequent progression to MBS have varied by race and sex over the last 20 years. BACKGROUND: Obesity is a growing public health crisis. MBS remains the most effective treatment for long-term management of obesity. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of electronic health records from a large tertiary academic health system using a previously validated natural language processing algorithm. The primary outcomes were discussion of MBS between eligible patients and providers and progression to surgery. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the association between sociodemographic factors, time, and discussion and receipt of MBS. RESULTS: Among 122,487 patients included in the analysis, 11,094 (9.1%) patients discussed MBS with their providers. Of these, 1348 (12.2%) progressed to MBS. Between 2000 and 2020 the annual fraction of patients who had a discussion of MBS with their providers rose from 3.2% to 10.0% (P < 0.001). Black people were equally likely to discuss MBS with providers as non-Black people (9.5 vs 9.0%, P = 0.09) but were less likely to progress to MBS (8.4 vs 12.6%, P < 0.001). These disparities in progression narrowed over the study period (P = 0.044). Men were less likely than women to both discuss (8.1% vs 9.6%, P < 0.001) and receive MBS (7.6% vs 14.6%, P < 0.001), and these disparities increased over the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to reduce racial disparities in utilization of MBS should focus on progression from discussion to MBS. Interventions to increase the uptake of MBS among men are required across the care cascade."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with deleterious metabolic and hemodynamic changes resulting in cardiac remodeling. Bariatric surgery is highly effective for both weight reduction and reverse cardiac remodeling. However, whether these changes depend on the magnitude of weight loss is unknown. This study aims to compare cardiac structure and diastolic function before and after bariatric surgery and examine its association with body mass index (BMI) variation. METHODS: Consecutive bariatric patients operated between June 2023 and June 2024 were screened for inclusion. Patients with a) previous bariatric surgery, b) moderate to severe valvular disease, c) those without follow-up 1 year after the intervention, or c) those who declined to participate were excluded. Cardiac structure and diastolic function were assessed preoperatively and 12 months after the surgery. RESULTS: A sample of 70 patients was analyzed. After 12 months, the left atrial (LA) volume index went from 25.0 ± 6.1 ml/m2 to 29 ± 7 (p < 0.001) whereas diastolic and systolic left ventricular (LV) diameters decreased from 4.98 ± 0.43 cm to 4.53 ± 0.41 cm (p < 0.001) and from 3.17 ± 0.33 cm to 2.88 ± 0.28 cm (p < 0.001), respectively. LV mass index declined from 75 ± 15 to 65 ± 14 g/m2 (p < 0.001). In univariate linear regression analysis, LA volume index, diastolic and systolic LV diameters, and LV mass index were not associated with BMI reduction. These results were similar after adjustment for age and sex. The prevalence of grade I and grade II diastolic dysfunction decreased to 1 (1.4%) and 14 (20%), respectively (p = 0.2) with no association with BMI change. CONCLUSION: Significant reverse cardiac remodeling occurs after bariatric surgery with no association with BMI reduction. Further research is warranted to clarify the beneficial cardiovascular effects of bariatric surgery beyond weight loss."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment for obesity and metabolic disorders. In Poland, the growing prevalence of obesity has led to an increase in the demand for these procedures. Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) are the most frequently performed surgeries, while newer techniques, such as single-anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-S), single-anastomosis sleeve ileal bypass (SASI), and Nissen sleeve gastrectomy (N-SG) are emerging. The Comprehensive Specialist Care in Bariatrics (KOS-BAR) program, introduced in 2021, aims to standardize bariatric care in Poland. AIM: This study evaluates the state of bariatric surgery in Poland in 2023, focusing on procedure volumes, regional variations, and the role of KOS-BAR centers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A nationwide survey was conducted among bariatric surgery centers affiliated with the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Chapter of the Association of Polish Surgeons. Data on the number and types of surgeries performed in 2023 were collected and compared with previous reports to analyze trends. RESULTS: A total of 54 centers, including 18 KOS-BAR centers, participated in the survey, reporting a total of 9102 procedures performed in 2023. SG accounted for 82% of surgeries, followed by RYGB (9.7%) and one anastomosis gastric bypass (3.9%). Newer procedures, such as N-SG (0.4%), SASI (0.8%), and SADI-S (0.2%) were less frequently performed. Over a half of all surgeries (59.3%) were performed in KOS-BAR centers. Significant regional variations in procedure volumes were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery in Poland has seen substantial growth, with SG as the dominant procedure. However, regional disparities in access to care and the limited adoption of newer techniques persist. Expanding services to underserved regions and establishing a national registry are crucial for improving patient care and outcomes."

Bariatric surgery has been explored as a potential adjunctive treatment for pain relief by reducing mechanical stress and systemic inflammation. We report the case of a 42-year-old woman with a history of FBSS, chronic back pain, narcolepsy, rheumatoid arthritis, and obesity, who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy as part of a multidisciplinary pain management strategy. Despite having a spinal cord stimulator for pain control, she remained dependent on opioids, gabapentin, and amitriptyline. Following an uneventful surgery, postoperative pain was effectively managed with a ketamine infusion, leading to significant pain score reduction. The patient was discharged with an optimized pain regimen and demonstrated early improvements in mobility and overall well-being. This report highlights the potential role of bariatric surgery in managing chronic pain in patients with FBSS and obesity. It underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach, preoperative planning, and tailored postoperative pain management in optimizing outcomes. Further research is warranted to evaluate the long-term impact of bariatric surgery on chronic pain management and functional recovery in this patient population."

METHODS: Longitudinal, prospective, single cohort study, with consecutive sampling including OSA patients aged 18-65 years intervened of bariatric surgery. An anamnesis regarding OSA, a complete upper airway (UA) exploration and a cardiorespiratory polygraphy (CRP) pre- and post-surgery were performed. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients were included in this study. The overall surgical success and cure rates for bariatric surgery as a treatment for OSA were 61.4% and 52.6%, respectively. Factors predicting success were female sex (OR = 12.54; CI95% = 1.75-89.88, p = 0.012), age below 53 years old (OR = 7.24; CI95% = 1.48-35.51, p = 0.015) and pre-surgical weight below 105 kg (OR = 8.1; CI95% = 1.44-45.62, p = 0.018). Surgical success cases had lower weight and body mass index, greater weight loss, smaller postsurgical neck circumference and less palatal webbing, however these were not independent factors in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that bariatric surgery is a feasible option for OSA treatment in obese patients, with a higher success rate in female, younger and thinner patients. Moreover, adipose tissue on the UA has been proven to decrease as a result of weight loss, although not correlated with surgery success in the treatment of OSA."

      "abstract": "Obesity is recognised as a chronic, relapsing and progressive disease, and long-term weight maintenance remains one of the greatest challenges in obesity management. When treatment gets interrupted, recurrent weight gain might be expected. Funding structures for MBS in numerous health systems globally do not currently permit metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) to prevent recurrent weight gain in patients who are normal weight or overweight. Gastric band removal is frequently required due to long-term complications such as slippage, which raises an important question: should revisional MBS be considered for weight maintenance in patients who have successfully lost weight after gastric banding? With the increasing use of obesity management medications and the associated successful weight loss, we anticipate that more patients will discontinue pharmacological treatment after reaching a normal weight or overweight range. However, many of these patients may still seek MBS for long-term weight maintenance. We question whether weight maintenance should be considered an indication for MBS in patients who are currently normal weight or overweight but have a history of severe obesity and must discontinue their current obesity treatment."

Teleconsultation demonstrated comparable outcomes to face-to-face care regarding adherence rates (OR 1.17, p = 0.44) and postoperative BMI loss (MD - 0.29, p = 0.87), suggesting that teleconsultation may be an equally effective and viable alternative to in-person treatment.

Studies suggest that problematic alcohol consumption encompassing depression escalates gradually after surgery. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of bariatric surgery on the incidence of AUD and depression during the postoperative period. METHODS: Prospective study that evaluated 68 patients who underwent either sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). The presence of AUD and depression was assessed both pre- and post-operatively. AUD assessment utilized the AUD identification test-C score, whereas depression assessment employed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). RESULTS: The average age of the sample was 42.81±9.28 years, with 85.3% being female. The mean follow-up was 16.54±7.41 months. In the preoperative assessment, 92.6% of the sample fell into the low-risk category for AUD. No significant difference was observed between the RYGB and SG groups. Postoperatively, 89.7% of the sample was classified as low risk for AUD, with no significant differences compared with the preoperative assessment. Regarding depression, there was no significant difference between pre- and post-operative periods for all patients. However, a notable trend toward a reduction in \"severe depression\" was observed in the postoperative period for patients undergoing SG (pre: 14.0% vs. post: 7.0%, p=0.013). CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant difference in the presence of AUD and depression between pre- and post-operative assessments in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery.",

This systematic review aimed to summarise data on changes in intra-pancreatic fat deposition (IPFD) and total pancreas volume (TPV) following metabolic bariatric surgery and endoscopic bariatric therapy. The literature search was conducted in MEDLINE and Embase databases. Studies in humans were included if they reported on changes in IPFD and/or TPV from before to after bariatric procedure. Random effects meta-analysis was conducted. Fourteen studies (all involving metabolic bariatric surgery) met the eligibility criteria. Metabolic bariatric surgery resulted in a mean absolute IPFD reduction of 3.9% (p = 0.003) and a mean TPV decrease of 10.7 cm3 (p < 0.001). The mean relative IPFD reduction after metabolic bariatric surgery was 35.9%. Sleeve gastrectomy led to a higher mean relative IPFD reduction than Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (39.9% vs. 20.6%), though this difference was not statistically significant. Analysis of follow-up duration showed a mean relative IPFD reduction of 8.8% in patients with follow-ups of less than 3 months. Metabolic bariatric surgery leads to significant reductions in IPFD and TPV. Follow-up should take place no earlier than 3 months for the full benefits of bariatric procedures on the pancreas to manifest.",

The purpose of this study was to compare rates of revision surgery after primary ankle arthrodesis (\"arthrodesis\") and total ankle arthroplasty (\"arthroplasty\") for patients who had undergone bariatric surgery and those who had not (\"control group\"). METHODS: In this retrospective study, we used data from the PearlDiver database to compare 5-year revision surgery rates after arthroplasty and arthrodesis in patients with and without a history of bariatric surgery. Cohorts were propensity-matched by age, sex, and Charlson Comorbidity Index value in a 1:4 ratio. We explored the following surgical outcomes: arthroplasty revision, joint infection, instrumentation removal, open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), and adjacent joint fusion. Cumulative incidence was calculated through Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and compared using Cox proportional hazard ratios. RESULTS: At 5 years after arthrodesis, the likelihood of adjacent joint fusion was higher among patients with a history of bariatric surgery than among control patients (hazard ratio: 1.8, 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 2.6); however, we found no differences in surgical outcomes for joint infection, instrumentation removal, or ORIF. At 5 years after arthroplasty, surgical outcomes did not differ between those with a history of bariatric surgery versus control patients. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that a history of bariatric surgery is not an important predictor of joint infection, instrumentation removal, or ORIF within 5 years after primary total ankle arthroplasty or arthrodesis. When choosing between arthroplasty or arthrodesis in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery, higher incidence of adjacent joint fusion should be a consideration. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III, Retrospective cohort study."

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 8,087 participants from NHANES (2015-2018). Bariatric surgery and kidney stone history were self-reported. Logistic regression models adjusted for demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors were used to evaluate associations. Stratified analyses explored effect modification by subgroups. RESULTS: Kidney stones were more prevalent among participants with bariatric surgery (26.57%) compared to those without (10.92%, P < 0.001). Bariatric surgery was associated with increased odds of kidney stones in the crude model (OR: 2.95, 95% CI: 1.57-5.55) and adjusted models (OR: 2.69, 95% CI: 1.27-5.70). Subgroup analyses highlighted stronger associations among females and participants with moderate physical activity. CONCLUSION: Metabolic and bariatric surgery is linked to an elevated risk of kidney stones, influenced by demographic and clinical factors. Personalized counseling on hydration and dietary modifications is essential for mitigating this risk.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity is a predisposing factor for the onset of hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis (HTG-AP). Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) has demonstrated significant short-term efficacy in the treatment of HTG-AP. The current evaluated the long-term efficacy of MBS for the management of recurrent HTG-AP. METHODS: Between 01 January 2015 and 31 August 2019, a total of 51 patients diagnosed with obesity combined with HTG-AP at our hospital were enrolled in the study. 14 underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), 9 underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), and 28 underwent routine treatment including dietary therapy, pharmacotherapy, and plasma exchange. The aim of the study was to investigate the long-term therapeutic effects of LRYGB, LSG, and routine treatment on recurrent HTG-AP, and to assess patient prognoses under different treatment modalities. RESULTS: The LSG and LRYGB groups achieved significant average weight loss, whereas the changes in the routine treatment group were not significant. The LRYGB group exhibited more weight loss than the LSG group. In both the LSG and LRYGB groups triglyceride levels decreased significantly within the first year after surgery. The routine treatment group exhibited a pancreatitis recurrence rate of 57.14%, compared to 15.38% in the LSG group and 11.11% in the LRYGB group. CONCLUSIONS: Over a period of 5 years, LSG and LRYGB exhibited superior efficacy with respect to managing metabolic syndrome associated with recurrent HTG-AP, particularly by enhancing weight management and reducing the pancreatitis recurrence rate. These findings support the long-term efficacy of MBS for the treatment of recurrent HTG-AP.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To this end, we carried out a cross-sectional, quantitative, analytical study with a convenience sample and with data collected through online questionnaires available on Google Forms™. RESULTS: There was a higher frequency for females. Cognitive restriction was the predominant eating behavior domain. We found an association between body image distortion and cognitive restriction (p = 0.001) and between body image distortion and emotional eating (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results elucidated the importance of researching eating behavior and body image in people who have had bariatric surgery. New prospective studies should be encouraged to understand the cause-effect relationship between eating behavior and body image.",

      "abstract": "Bariatric surgery (BS) is an effective treatment for severe obesity and its related comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. However, the anatomical and physiological changes associated with these procedures significantly increase the risk of preoperative and postoperative micronutrient deficiencies, which can lead to severe complications such as anemia, osteoporosis, and neurological disorders. This narrative review examines the prevalence and clinical implications of micronutrient deficiencies in BS patients, as well as evidence-based strategies for their prevention and management. The most common deficiencies include iron, vitamin B12, folate, calcium, vitamin D, and fat-soluble vitamins (A, E, and K). Procedures with a hypoabsorptive component, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD/DS), pose higher risks of deficiencies compared to restrictive procedures like sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Effective strategies involve the preoperative correction of deficiencies, continuous monitoring, and tailored supplementation. However, long-term adherence to supplementation tends to decrease over time, influenced by behavioral and socioeconomic factors. Hence, preventing and managing micronutrient deficiencies are crucial for the long-term success of BS. While current guidelines provide valuable recommendations, many are based on low-certainty evidence, underscoring the need for more robust studies. A multidisciplinary approach, combined with innovative strategies, such as telemedicine, can enhance adherence and achieve sustainable clinical outcomes.",

The effect of eHealth interventions on the MBS preparation process is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of adding an application to the nutritional preparation process on pre-surgery nutritional knowledge, physical, and behavioral parameters among MBS candidates. METHODS: An open-label randomized controlled trial among MBS candidates. All participants received 3-6 meetings with an RD and the intervention group also received access to an application containing information modules and a communication platform. Data was collected at baseline and end of preparation. RESULTS: Forty participants were recruited, of them 67.5% women, with a mean age and body mass index of 34 ± 10.1 years and 43.5 ± 6.0 kg/m2, respectively. Nutritional knowledge, anthropometrics, functionality, adherence to most behavioral recommendations, and subjective state of health improved in both groups (P Time ≤ 0.044). Physical activity initiation (i.e., beginning of regular exercise engagement) was higher among the intervention group (40% at baseline and 68% at end of preparation vs 35% at baseline and 32% at end of preparation for interventions and controls, respectively, P Time × Group = 0.026). The application was rated as providing added value (8.2 on a scale of 1 (no added value) to 10 (meaningful added value)). CONCLUSIONS: Nutrition preparation process with an RD improved MBS knowledge, adherence to behavioral recommendations, subjective state of health, and modestly enhanced weight and functionality outcomes among MBS candidates. Although rated as having an added value, incorporating an application had only a minimal impact on these outcomes.",

Outcome analysis focused on postoperative bleeding, length of hospital stay (LOS), TXA side effects, mortality, transfusion needs, and thromboembolic complications. From 93 results, six studies involving 1121 patients were included. TXA use significantly decreased the LOS (MD = - 0.12; 95% CI, - 0.18, - 0.06; p < 0.01), operative time (MD = - 5.77; 95% CI, - 9.98, - 1.56; p < 0.01), and postoperative bleeding (OR = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.34, 0.98; p = 0.043). However, TXA did not affect the rate of hematoma formation (OR = 0.39; 95% CI, 0.07, 2.29; p = 0.299), rate of reoperation (OR = 0.46; 95% CI, 0.08, 2.82; p = 0.403), or need for transfusion (OR = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.06, 1.07; p = 0.062). There were no thromboembolic events or mortality. TXA significantly reduces LOS, operative time, and postoperative bleeding in bariatric surgery without affecting reoperation rates.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Metabolic-bariatric surgery (MBS) is the last effective way to lose weight whom around half of the patients are women of reproductive age. It is recommended an interval of 12 months between surgery and pregnancy to optimize weight loss and nutritional status. Predicting pregnancy up to 12 months after MBS is important for evaluating reproductive health services in bariatric centers; therefore, this study aimed to present a prediction model for pregnancy at the first year following MBS using machine learning (ML) algorithms. METHODS: In a nested case-control study of 473 women with a history of pregnancy after MBS during 2009-2023, predisposing factors in pregnancy within 12 months after MBS were identified and subsequently, several ML models, including the classification algorithms and decision trees, as well as regression analyses, were applied to predict pregnancy up to 12 months after MBS. RESULTS: The highest area under the curve (AUC) was 0.920 ± 0.014 (95%CI 0.906, 0.927) for the C5.0 decision tree with sensitivity and specificity of 0.762 ± 0.044 (95%CI 0.739, 0.801) and 0.916 ± 0.028 (95%CI 0.883, 0.922), respectively. This model considered thirteen important factors to predict pregnancy at the first 12 months following MB, including menstrual irregularity, marital status, a history of abnormal fetal development, age, infertility type, parity, gravidity, fertility treatment, presurgery body mass index (BMI), infertility, infertility duration, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). CONCLUSION: Developing the ML models, which predict pregnancy within 12 months after MBS, can help bariatric surgeons and obstetricians to prevent and manage suboptimal surgical response and adverse pregnancy outcomes.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a frequent adverse event after bariatric surgery and is associated with patient dissatisfaction and increased health care burden. Aggressive multimodal antiemetic prophylaxis and the use of propofol infusion during anesthesia are associated with the reduction of PONV. In this study, we examined the use of rescue antiemetics following bariatric surgery performed with 3 different anesthetic strategies designed to reduce PONV: (1) primary volatile (VOL) anesthetic and propofol (PROP) infusion (VOL+PROP), (2) volatile anesthetic with propofol and dexmedetomidine (DEX) infusions (VOL+PROP+DEX), or (3) opioid-sparing total intravenous anesthesia (PROP+DEX). METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we included patients undergoing bariatric surgery from 2018-2022 who received 1 of 3 anesthetics: (1) VOL+PROP, (2) VOL+PROP+DEX, or (3) opioid-sparing PROP+DEX without a VOL. Inverse probability of treatment weighting analysis determined the association between the need for rescue-antiemetics in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and following PACU discharge. RESULTS: Three hundred thirty-two patients received VOL+PROP, 354 VOL+PROP+DEX, and 166 PROP+DEX, and all received prophylactic antiemetics during surgery. After surgery, the PROP+DEX patients received fewer rescue antiemetics in the PACU compared with VOL+PROP (11% vs. 24%, P =0.002), and VOL+PROP+DEX fewer compared with VOL+PROP (16% vs. 24%, P =0.023). This differential antinausea effect was limited to PACU stay only. Rescue antiemetic use increased across all anesthetic management groups following PACU discharge until midnight on the day of surgery (ranging from 38% to 46% across groups, P =0.71) and through the first postoperative day (ranging from 47% to 57% across groups, P =0.20). CONCLUSIONS: The benefit associated with anesthetic strategies designed to reduce PONV was present but did not persist past PACU discharge. This finding suggests that aggressive perioperative multimodal antiemetic prophylaxis combined with anesthetic strategies designed to prevent PONV after bariatric surgery have only a short-lived effect, thus health care staff in hospital wards may expect to encounter high rates of PONV in these patients. There is a need for the development of novel antinausea treatments to reduce the rate of this frequent postoperative complication.",

      "abstract": "Post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH) is a metabolic complication of individuals with obesity who have undergone bariatric surgery, characterized by rapid glycemic excursions followed by hypoglycemic events usually occurring 1-3 h post-meal. Without an approved pharmacotherapy, dietary modifications are essential for managing PBH, with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices emerging as crucial tools for capturing postprandial glucose responses that can guide intervention strategies to prevent PBH. The effectiveness of such interventions is based on the availability of rich datasets, containing both CGM and meal data. However, meal information is often incomplete, being its manual recording burdensome and prone to user-related errors. In response, we proposed a template match algorithm (TMA) for the retrospective identification of unreported meals using CGM data only. TMA relies on a similarity score calculated between a post-prandial glycemic curve template and the glycemic trace of interest. Our study demonstrates promising results: TMA correctly identifies 1237 out of 1340 meals, generating 208 false positives within a dataset of 20 PBH subjects monitored in free-living conditions for nearly 50 days, yielding a median F1-score of 0.90. The effectiveness of TMA enables its use to enhance data quality in long-term studies involving PBH patients, facilitating the development of new approaches to manage PBH.",

      "abstract": "Data from clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness and safety of metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) compared to lifestyle modifications (LSM) in children and adolescents with obesity are scarce. This systematic review and meta-analysis (SRM) sought to fill this knowledge gap. Randomised or non-randomised trials spanning at least one-year involving children and adolescents with severe obesity receiving any form of MBS in the intervention group and LSM for weight loss in the control group were systematically searched through electronic databases. This SRM adhered to the guidelines outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the PRISMA checklists. The primary outcome of interest was the change in body weight from the baseline. Five trials (three randomised, open-label and two non-randomised) with 1-2 years follow-up durations were analysed, including 367 participants aged 10-19 years. MBS resulted in greater reductions in body weight (mean difference [MD] -25.83 kg, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-36.91, -14.75], p < .00001) and per cent body weight (MD -24.54%, 95% CI [-33.19, -15.89], p < .00001) compared to LSM. Furthermore, MBS outperformed LSM in reducing body mass index (BMI), BMI z-score, waist circumference, glycated haemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose, insulin resistance, triglycerides, alanine aminotransferase, high sensitivity C-reactive protein and an overall improvement of physical functioning and quality of life. The safety profile was comparable between the two groups; however, data was scarce. Larger, longer-term trials that include multinational and multiethnic representation are essential for making solid clinical practice recommendations regarding MBS for children with obesity."

METHODS: We describe a case of an obese LOPD patient who underwent sleeve gastrectomy, with clinical follow-up conducted to monitor motor and respiratory functions, as well as patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), over time. RESULTS: The surgery was well-tolerated without significant complications, and prolonged stability in motor and respiratory functions was observed. Furthermore, the patient reported improvements in quality of life and PROMs following weight loss. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that bariatric surgery, specifically sleeve gastrectomy, may be a safe and effective complementary strategy for weight loss in LOPD patients, offering benefits in functional stability, and quality of life.",

This study aimed to analyse patients' and professionals' experiences with the perioperative care process and identify their perceptions of the bariatric surgery process to support the long-term management of obesity surgical treatment. This study also wants to develop a framework to sustain a long-term follow-up. This qualitative study was conducted in July 2022 at a bariatric surgery centre in southern Portugal, comprising four focus group sessions. Participants included seven health professionals in one focus group and 16 patients divided across three focus groups. Patients were selected based on specific criteria, including those awaiting bariatric surgery and those who had undergone surgery within the past 1 to 5 years. The patient focus group script consisted of 11 open-ended main questions with follow-up prompts to explore motivations, experiences with the presurgery and postsurgery processes and perceptions of lifestyle changes. Sessions lasted between 40 and 70 min. Participants reported the need for a reference professional in the hospital to contact, the importance of psychological support to help patients deal with the 'ups and downs' of postsurgery life and the financial support for physical activity programmes. This research helped identify a need for a framework for long-term follow-up and showed priorities to tailor health services for managing bariatric surgery patients. This team should be led by a dedicated case manager and include physical activity specialists."

Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment where less invasive management has been unsuccessful. The impact of socioeconomic deprivation on surgical outcomes is a novel area of research. The present study aims to investigate the effect of socioeconomic deprivation on bariatric surgery outcomes. METHODS: Data was prospectively collected at a regional bariatric centre in Scotland. The study included patients who received either a Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) or Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG) (2008-2022). Follow-up occurred postoperatively at 6 months, 1 year and annually thereafter. Socioeconomic deprivation was measured using the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) using residential postcodes to generate a deprivation quintile (Q1-5). The primary outcome was percentage total weight loss (%TWL). Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications, comorbidity status, nutritional status, length of stay and re-admissions. Grouped analysis was conducted to represent a more deprived group (Q1-3) and a less deprived group (Q4-5). Statistical analysis was carried out of the data. The study was carried out using the STROBE principles. RESULTS: 316 patients were included (median follow-up, 7 years; median %TWL, 23.8%). There was no significant difference in median %TWL (p = 0.528), short-term (p = 0.619) or long-term (p = 0.164) complications and resolution (p = 0.472), improvement (p = 0.282) or exacerbation of comorbidities (p = 0.717) between socioeconomic quintiles. CONCLUSION: Socioeconomic deprivation does not limit bariatric surgery outcomes and should not be a barrier to surgery.",

The FSFI questionnaire was applied before the intervention and 24 months after surgery. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was evaluated using the PREDIMED questionnaire. RESULTS: Among the 240 participants, 70.8% presented preoperative sexual dysfunction, which decreased to 20.5% two years post-surgery. Significant improvements were observed in all FSFI domains except for pain. Good adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with higher scores in the lubrication, orgasm, and satisfaction domains. CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery significantly improves female sexual function, with the Mediterranean diet enhancing these benefits during the postoperative period. Future studies must investigate additional variables such as psychological factors, physical activity, and other lifestyle changes that may also influence sexual function.",

This study comprehensively examines long-term changes in Quality of Life (QoL) following abdominoplasty in individuals who have undergone MWL. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, 54 post-bariatric patients who had experienced MWL and subsequently underwent abdominoplasty were included. The mean age was 50.8 years. Multiple aspects of QoL were assessed using a specially designed questionnaire administered pre- and postoperatively. Inclusion criteria included a BMI < 35 and a previous bariatric procedure. RESULTS: The physical component score (PCS-12) demonstrated significant improvement both early and late postoperatively, whereas the mental component score (MCS-12) showed no significant change. Vitality and self-acceptance exhibited significant improvements in both the short and long term. In contrast, body contact, sexuality, and self-esteem showed no long-term improvement post-surgery. Depression scores (PHQ-4) had no positive impact on long-term QoL. Body function (X-SMFA) showed significant long-term improvement, though the impairment score revealed no significant change. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with prior research, abdominoplasty following MWL leads to positive physical outcomes. However, the impact on body image is heterogeneous, with no sustained improvement observed in some psychosocial dimensions. As depression and body impairment scores also do not show lasting improvement, patients with expectations of broad QoL enhancements should be carefully selected and assessed for potential multidisciplinary treatment."

      "abstract": "Introduction: Obesity is a chronic disease associated with increased risk for several cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. The majority of CRC cases are associated with modifiable risk factors. Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is a proven, durable, and successful intervention for obesity. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of MBS on CRC risk through measures of association, such as relative risk (RR) and odds ratio (OR). Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Embase was conducted to identify systematic reviews (SR) and meta-analyses examining the relationship between obesity treated with MBS and CRC incidence. The PICO framework guided inclusion criteria, and three independent reviewers screened articles using Rayyan software. Quality assessment was performed using AMSTAR2. Results: Of 1336 screened articles, 10 SR met inclusion criteria, encompassing 53,452,658 patients. Meta-analyses consistently showed a significant reduction in CRC risk following MBS in patients with severe obesity. Risk reductions were reported by Liu et al. (RR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.32-0.67, p < 0.01), Chierici et al. (RR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.28-0.75, p = 0.018), Wilson et al. (RR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.53-0.88, p = 0.003), and Pararas et al. (RR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.40-0.80, p < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses supported these findings. For colon cancer, Liu and Chierici both reported an RR of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.46-1.21, p = 0.2444) with significant heterogeneity (I2 = 89%). A trend towards reduced rectal cancer risk (RR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.40-1.39, p = 0.3523) was noted but limited by fewer studies. Sex-specific analyses revealed protective effects in both sexes, with a more pronounced impact in females (RR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.37-0.79, p = 0.0014). Conclusions: This umbrella review synthesizes current evidence on the impact of MBS on CRC risk, highlighting a consistent protective association. The findings also indicate a potential risk reduction for both colon and rectal cancer, with a more pronounced effect observed among females compared to males. Given the profound implications of MBS on cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, further high-quality, long-term studies are essential to deepen our understanding and optimize its role in cancer prevention and patient care."

We aimed to analyse the prevalence of MS following BS. METHODS: On October 5, 2023, we conducted a literature search on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane. RevManv5.4 was used for the analysis. RESULTS: MS patients who underwent BS had lower odds of MS within the first year post-BS (OR 0.14, 95%CI 0.12-0.17); patients who had a preoperative BMI < 50 showed a higher reduction in MS post-BS compared with patients who suffered from super obesity (OR 0.12 versus OR 0.17). Older patients (age > 42) had lower odds of MS post-BS compared with younger patients (OR 0.05 versus OR 0.17). There was not a difference in MS prevalence between 1 and 2 years postoperatively (OR 1.07, 95%CI 0.72-1.58). Asians reported the highest reduction in MS post-BS (OR 0.08). MS patients who received medical treatment had three times the odds of having MS compared with patients who underwent BS. Patients who had BS reported a decline in their anti-hypertensives and oral anti-diabetic drugs (OR 0.26, 95%CI 0.15-0.46, OR 0.11, 95%CI 0.07-0.16, respectively). There was not a significant difference in MS prevalence between patients who underwent RYGB and those who had SG (OR 2.16, 95%CI 0.74-6.26). CONCLUSIONS: BS is superior to medical treatment in the remission of MS. Age, preoperative BMI, and country of origin affect the rates of MS remission. BS results in a sustainable resolution of MS across 1, 2, and 5 years post-surgery. A tailored approach is warranted to achieve the best outcomes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity is a growing health concern worldwide, including United Arab Emirates. Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment option, with to date unclear weight loss mechanisms. In this prospective study, we explored post-bariatric surgery changes in energy homeostasis, gut peptides, hormones, and gut microbiota. METHOD: We recruited 19 Emirati adults who were planning to undergo sleeve gastrectomy (SG). We assessed the energy requirements using 24-hour diet recalls, indirect calorimetry for resting energy expenditure (REE), and a questionnaire for appetite. Anthropometrics included body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio, fat mass, fat-free mass, and percentage of body fat. Gut peptides, including peptide YY (PYY), glucagon-like peptide-1/2 (GLP-1/2), ghrelin (GHR), cholecystokinin (CCK), insulin, and leptin, were quantified using ELISA. Gut microbiota composition at phylum and genus levels, including the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio and alpha (α) and beta (β) diversity, was determined by sequencing amplicons of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA at baseline and three months post-surgery. Comparisons used paired sample T-test, Wilcoxon, and McNemar test. QIIME 2 was used to identify taxa and their relative abundance; subsequent analyses were done in R for (α) and (β) diversity (package qiime2R) and Wilcoxon signed-rank test in R for differences in microbiota at phylum and genus levels. We conducted Spearman correlation analyses between genera and energy homeostasis, appetite, anthropometrics, hormones, and gut peptides. RESULTS: At three months post-SG, energy intake, appetite, all anthropometric indices, insulin, leptin, and GLP-1 significantly decreased; PYY and GHR significantly increased, and REE was stable. β-diversity of the gut microbiota and its composition at phylum and genus levels significantly changed post-surgery, yet F/B remained constant. Energy intake, BMI, and appetite negatively correlated with several taxa that significantly increased post-SG. CONCLUSION: Gut peptides, hormones, and microbiota change partly account for bariatric surgery's weight-loss benefits. Understanding these alterations can inform personalized interventions targeting obesity.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of obesity continues to increase worldwide. Obesity is associated with an increased risk of cardiometabolic and other diseases, reduced quality of life and shortened life expectancy. Highly effective therapies are required to achieve meaningful and sustained weight reduction to prevent, slow or reverse disease associated with obesity. Bariatric surgery is a highly effective intervention to induce weight loss, with observational data demonstrating durability of weight loss over 10 or more years. In addition, bariatric surgery improves cardiometabolic risk factors, including hyperglycaemia and type 2 diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Observational data have shown a reduction in all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events and mortality and a reduction in cancer risk and mortality in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery compared to matched patients who did not have surgery. The emergence of newer incretin agonists, particularly semaglutide and tirzepatide, have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in inducing and maintaining weight loss with ongoing use. As for bariatric surgery, incretin agonist therapies also improve type 2 diabetes outcomes, cardiovascular mortality and other obesity-related complications, with new evidence emerging and long-term outcome data awaited. This perspective compares bariatric surgery and incretin agonist therapy, assessing their relative efficacies in weight reduction, impact on obesity-related complications, their respective risk profiles and considerations of cost-effectiveness and equity of access. These comparisons seek to evaluate whether these increasingly popular medications could make bariatric surgery a thing of the past.",

      "abstract": "Bariatric surgery (BS) is an effective intervention for obesity and related metabolic disorders, significantly improving metabolic health and alleviating hormonal imbalances. However, it induces complex endocrine changes that can lead to dysfunctions, impacting the somatotropic, gonadal, thyroid, pancreatic, and adrenal axes. This review highlights the dual effects of BS on the endocrine system. A comprehensive review of peer-reviewed studies using PRISMA guidelines was conducted, focusing on human research evaluating pre and postoperative endocrine parameters. Studies were selected for their relevance and quality in elucidating the endocrine consequences of BS. BS restores growth hormone secretion and improves fertility but may disrupt insulin-like growth factor-1 recovery and sex hormone balance, leading to bone loss and catabolic states. Postprandial insulin hypersecretion can result in hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, with impaired counter-regulatory hormone responses. Secondary hyperparathyroidism and reduced bone density highlight additional risks. Changes in thyroid hormone levels have implications for both hypothyroid and euthyroid patients. These findings underscore the interplay between improved metabolic control and potential endocrine dysfunctions. The current evidence predominantly comprises association studies that may not be of quality for safe clinical decision-making, highlighting the need for high-quality research to establish causality and refine therapeutic strategies. Bridging knowledge gaps in the mechanisms underlying these changes is crucial to optimizing BS outcomes. A holistic approach integrating preoperative screening, individualized postoperative care, and targeted therapies is essential to mitigate complications while maximizing benefits."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of zoledronic acid for the prevention of bone loss after bariatric surgery. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blinded study, 59 patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy (mean [SD], age: 48.9 [6.3] years, BMI: 42.3 [5.3], 73% female) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either zoledronic acid (5 mg; intervention [INT]) or placebo (control [CON]) preoperatively. The primary endpoint was the change in spine volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) at 12 months after surgery. Secondary outcomes included changes in hip and femoral neck vBMD and areal BMD. RESULTS: The estimated mean treatment effects of zoledronic acid on the spine and total hip were 6.8 mg/cm3 (95% CI 1.9-11.7; p = 0.003) and 5.0 mg/cm3 (95% CI: 1.4-8.5; p = 0.006), respectively. Bone mass in the spine increased by 2.6% in INT, whereas no changes were observed in CON. Additionally, bone loss in the total hip was prevented in INT compared with CON (vBMD: -0.6% vs. -3.6%; p = 0.006).

      "abstract": "PurposeBariatric surgery is a widely used treatment for obesity; however, it may be associated with certain complications. Effective postoperative management, including lifestyle interventions and exercise training, is essential for optimal outcomes. This study explores the effectiveness of exercise training in postoperative care.MethodsWe searched PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Embase up to April 3, 2024. Articles were screened and data extracted based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. Risk of bias was assessed using RoB 2.0, and data were analyzed with Stata 15.0.ResultsTwenty-three articles involving 1940 patients were included; 16 were analyzed quantitatively. Exercise training did not significantly reduce body weight compared to routine care (WMD: -0.26; 95% CI, -2.11 to 1.58; I2 = 54%), but it significantly reduced fat mass (WMD: -2.42; 95% CI, -3.50 to -1.34; I2 = 42.9%) and maintained lean mass (WMD: 1.40; 95% CI, 0.32 to 2.48; I2 = 0.0%). Additionally, it reduced waist circumference (WMD: -2.58; 95% CI, -4.43 to -0.73; I2 = 13.4%) and improved exercise capacity (VO₂ max: WMD: 1.88; 95% CI, 0.64 to 3.13; I2 = 0.0%).ConclusionWhile exercise training did not significantly lower body weight post-surgery, it effectively reduced fat mass, maintained lean mass, and improved waist circumference and exercise capacity. Given the limited sample sizes in most studies, further large-scale controlled trials are warranted for more definitive conclusions, along with further consideration of their long-term impact on health metrics.",

However, due to limited data, there is uncertainty regarding the short-, mid-, and long-term safety and efficacy profile of MBS in patients with a preoperative ASA IV status. METHODS: A single-center retrospective cohort study was performed on patients with ASA IV status who underwent sleeve gastrectomy (SG), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), or biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS) between 2008 and 2020. Data collected included operative details; postoperative complications at 30 days, 90 days, and beyond 90 days; BMI changes; and resolution of obesity-related comorbidities at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 60 months postoperatively. RESULTS: Among 131 ASA class IV patients, 43 patients underwent SG (32.8%), 66 patients underwent RYGB (50.4%), and 22 patients underwent BPD-DS (16.8%). The greatest %TWL occurred in the BPD-DS cohort (39.5%) at 24 months post-op followed by the RYGB (32.5%) and SG (20.7%) cohorts (p < 0.001). The overall major 30-day complication rate was 8.4% (n = 11/131), while the overall major 90-day complication rate within the cohort was 6.9% (n = 9/131). The overall major late (> 90 days) complication rate was found to be 14.5% (n = 19/131). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that MBS is relatively safe and effective in ASA IV patients in the short-, mid-, and long-term. Accordingly, careful procedure selection is required in this patient population. Further long-term studies are needed to support our findings.",

      "abstract": "Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignant disease in Canada, and women with an elevated body mass index carry an increased lifetime risk of developing this disease. As rates of obesity have risen, the rates of endometrial cancer have seen a similar rise. Given this association, women diagnosed with endometrial cancer often suffer from several obesity-related co-morbidities, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Studies have suggested that women with early-stage endometrial cancer have a higher potential to die of obesity-related complications than recurrence and that weight reduction would be beneficial for these patients to improve quality-of-life and long-term obesity-related morbidity and mortality. Bariatric surgery is currently the only treatment modality to result in sustained long-term weight loss for this cohort of patients. Early evidence has suggested that combining bariatric surgery with total laparoscopic hysterectomy may improve the underlying metabolic disease, the patients' quality of life, and the long-term obesity-related morbidity and mortality. Additionally, the inclusion of bariatric surgery in treatment of patients with obesity and endometrial cancer may decrease the projected lifetime health care cost when compared to hysterectomy alone. This narrative review aims to examine the evidence surrounding endometrial cancer and its link to obesity. Further, we hope to explore current treatments for the aforementioned conditions and the possible benefits and feasibility of a combined intervention of vertical sleeve gastrectomy and total laparoscopic hysterectomy for patients with obesity and endometrial cancer.",

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of MBS among US adults with obesity by diabetes status and selected sociodemographic characteristics. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data from the 2016-2020 Nationwide Inpatient Sample and Nationwide Ambulatory Surgery Sample to capture MBS procedures. The National Health Interview Survey was used to establish the denominator for incidence calculations. Participants included US non-pregnant adults aged ≥18 years with obesity. The main outcome was incident MBS without previous MBS, defined by International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision Procedure Codes, Diagnosis Related Group system codes, and Current Procedural Terminology codes. Adjusted incidence and annual percentage change (2016-2019) were estimated using logistic regression. RESULTS: Among US adults with obesity, over 900 000 MBS procedures were performed in inpatient and hospital-owned ambulatory surgical centers in the USA during 2016-2020. The age- and sex-adjusted incidence of MBS per 1000 adults was 5.9 (95% CI 5.4 to 6.4) for adults with diabetes and 2.0 (95% CI 1.9 to 2.1) for adults without diabetes. MBS incidence was significantly higher for women and adults with class III obesity regardless of diabetes status. The highest incidence of MBS occurred in the Northeast region. Sleeve gastrectomy was the most common MBS surgical approach. CONCLUSIONS: Incident MBS procedures were nearly threefold higher among adults with obesity and diabetes than those with obesity but without diabetes. Continued monitoring of the trends of MBS and other treatment modalities can inform our understanding of treatment accessibility to guide prevention efforts aimed at reducing obesity and diabetes.",

The effectiveness of Metabolic and Bariatric surgery (MBS) as a therapeutic option across different age groups remains debated. This study aimed to compare the outcomes and complications of MBS in patients less than 50 years old and 50 years or older. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This retrospective study analyzed data from patients who underwent MBS in a referral hospital in Mashhad, Iran, between April 2012 and March 2017. The recorded follow-up information was included for patients with at least six months post-surgery. RESULTS: The study included 709 patients, 519 patients aged ≤ 50 years, and 190 patients > 50. The average age, weight, and BMI of the participants were 42.7 ± 13.24 years, 126.6 ± 31.23 kg, and 47.2 ± 10.37 kg/m2, respectively. Both age groups demonstrated significant improvements in BMI, cholesterol, and TG levels post-surgery, while significant improvements in FBS levels were observed only in the younger group (p < 0.05). Overall, substantial reductions in the prevalence of obesity-related comorbidity were observed in both age groups post-surgery (p < 0.05). None of the post-surgical complications had a statistically significant difference between the two age groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: MBS is effective in reducing obesity-related comorbidities, regardless of age. Age should not be a limiting factor for MBS, as the benefits and complications do not differ significantly between patients under and over 50 years old.",

Therefore, this study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the impact of adjunctive tirzepatide therapy over 6 months following sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). METHODS: Post-bariatric patients without type 2 diabetes with IWL or WR (n = 21) were analyzed. Key outcomes included changes in weight, BMI, waist circumference, body composition, basal metabolism, metabolic markers, and inflammatory markers. Subgroup analyses assessed differences based on sex, surgery type, and classification as IWL or WR. Linear regression was performed to identify predictors of weight loss outcomes. RESULTS: At 6 months, mean total weight loss was 12.0 % ± 3.4 % (p < 0.001), with significant reductions in BMI, waist circumference, body fat percentage, and HbA1c. Basal metabolism declined proportionally with weight loss. Weight loss ≥ 5 % occurred in 100.0 % of patients, ≥ 10 % in 76.5 %, and ≥ 15 % in 23.5 %. Basal metabolism differences between RYGB and SG patients converged by 6 months. Male and female patients showed comparable weight loss and metabolic adaptation. IWL patients experienced less fat-free mass loss at 3 months compared to WR (p < 0.05). Baseline BMI nadir, prior weight regain, body composition, and chronic inflammation were significant predictors of weight loss outcomes. DISCUSSION: Tirzepatide treatment significantly enhances weight loss and metabolic health in post-bariatric patients, regardless of surgery type or sex. Differences in fat-free mass loss highlight the need for tailored interventions in IWL and WR groups. Baseline factors, including inflammation and body composition, may help predict treatment success.",

      "abstract": "PROBLEM: The rate of pregnancy following bariatric surgery is rising globally and is associated with health benefits but also increased risk of micronutrient deficiency, preterm birth and small for gestational age offspring. Bariatric surgery may limit women's ability to meet the nutrient demands of pregnancy, necessitating individualised nutrition therapy. However, little is known about women's experiences of, and preferences for nutrition-related care during pregnancy after bariatric surgery. AIM: To describe women's experiences of pregnancy after bariatric surgery, focussing on nutrition-related care. METHODS: This qualitative study interviewed women across Australia with a history of any bariatric surgery. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted after 36-weeks gestation and before childbirth. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. FINDINGS: Thirteen women aged 26-37 participated. Three themes were generated: navigating healthcare, the personal toll of pregnancy after bariatric surgery, and women's agency. Despite a strong desire for specialised nutrition care, women encountered several barriers to accessing this. When care was available, it often did not meet women's needs due to healthcare professionals' limited understanding of the nutrition challenges faced in pregnancies following bariatric surgery. This compelled women to seek information outside their maternity care team and advocate for themselves during care. DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the need to address barriers to accessing nutrition care for pregnant women following bariatric surgery. Improved understanding of pregnancy and post-operative symptoms may enable enhanced woman-centred care. CONCLUSION: Greater awareness of bariatric surgery among all maternity care professionals is needed to improve opportunities for informed, shared decision-making with pregnant women.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Suboptimal initial clinical response (SICR) and weight gain recurrence (WGR) are challenging issues following bariatric surgery. Recently, the promising weight loss effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have been applied to bariatric patients. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 RAs in the treatment of SICR and WGR after bariatric surgery. METHODS: A literature search was performed across online databases. The primary outcomes were percentage of total weight loss (%TWL) and absolute weight loss. Secondary outcomes included changes in biochemical markers and adverse effects (AEs). RESULTS: Nineteen studies including 1290 patients were included. After at least 3 months of treatment, the pooled %TWL was 9.24% for liraglutide, 11.38% for semaglutide, and 15.50% for tirzepatide, with corresponding weight reductions of 8.56 kg, 11.62 kg, and 12.60 kg, respectively. Additionally, %TWL and weight loss with liraglutide use were 7.65% and 7.47 kg for ≤ 6 months, 10.22% and 9.30 kg for 6-12 months, and 10.80% and 9.72 kg for ≥ 12 months. For semaglutide, the %TWL and weight reduction were 10.18% and 9.43 kg at 6 months, and 13.15% and 14.68 kg at 12 months. Biochemical markers including triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, glycated hemoglobin, and alanine aminotransferase levels showed significant reductions after GLP-1 RA treatment. Common AEs were nausea (23%), vomiting (6%), diarrhea (6%), constipation (10%), headache (6%), fatigue (8%), abdominal pain (2%), and abdominal bloating (2%). The proportion of patients who discontinued the treatment due to AEs was 3%. CONCLUSIONS: GLP-1 RAs are effective and safe for treating SICR and WGR after bariatric surgery.",

We summarize the guidelines provided by various societies for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis resulting from bariatric surgery. Next, we discuss the use of traditional antiosteoporosis medications in this population. RECENT FINDINGS: Guidelines for preventing and treating osteoporosis resulting from bariatric surgery have been recently provided by various societies setting specific treatment criteria for postmenopausal women and men aged ≥ 50 years, based on the occurrence of fragility fractures and/or T-score thresholds. Several studies have highlighted the positive effects of lifestyle changes in preventing high-turnover bone loss; however, data on fracture outcomes are currently unavailable. It is generally accepted that following bariatric procedures, sufficient intake of calcium, vitamin D, and protein, along with regular exercise incorporating progressive, supervised resistance training, is crucial to counteract negative impacts on bone. Regarding the need for medications to combat osteoporosis, most societies recommend zoledronic acid as the preferred choice. This preference is due to the problems associated with oral bisphosphonates, including poor tolerance and absorption issues. Denosumab is typically considered the second choice when bisphosphonates are not suitable or well tolerated. Two randomized controlled studies have recently demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of zoledronic acid and denosumab in addressing high-turnover bone loss. Although guidelines exist for managing skeletal health before and after bariatric surgery, more research is required to validate these recommendations and the use of anti-osteoporosis medications.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity is a prevalent global disease closely linked to various chronic conditions. Bariatric surgery (BS) is currently recognized as the most effective treatment. Increasing evidence suggests that BS alters the gut microbiota (GM), which plays a crucial role in postoperative weight loss. However, there has been no systematic bibliometric analysis exploring the relationship between BS and GM to date. METHODS: We conducted a literature search on BS and GM from January 1, 1981, to May 25, 2024, within the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). We utilized Excel 2021, VOSviewer 1.6.19, CiteSpace 6.2.R3, and the R package \"bibliometrix\" 4.3.0, along with the online bibliometric analysis platform (https://bibliometric.com/app), to visualize publishing trends and research hotspots in this field. RESULTS: A total of 2,542 articles meeting the criteria were included. Since 2015, the rate of publication has significantly accelerated. The United States leads in both the number of publications and average citations per article. The University of São Paulo is the most active institution, whereas the University of Copenhagen has the highest average citation count. Obesity Surgery is the journal with the highest number of publications, and the most prolific author is Karine Clement. Keyword and thematic analyses indicate that \"gut microbiota\" and \"bariatric surgery\" are the primary research hotspots for future studies. CONCLUSION: In summary, this field is garnering increasing attention. Our findings suggest that future research will likely focus on the effects of bariatric surgery on gut microbiota and its biological mechanisms, the role of gut microbiota in the weight loss process, and the development of combined treatments based on gut microbiota."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Bariatric surgery is associated with reduced risk of cardiometabolic disease in obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). The mechanisms are not fully understood, but improvement in endothelial dysfunction has been implicated. OBJECTIVE: To assess endothelial biomarkers before and after surgery. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study with 2-year follow-up. SETTING: Single center in Stockholm, Sweden. PATIENTS: Adults undergoing bariatric surgery, 28 with and 33 without T2D. INTERVENTION: Roux-en-y gastric bypass preceded by 2 weeks low-calorie diet (LCD). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Plasma concentrations of glycocalyx biomarkers (hyaluronan and syndecan-1), E-Selectin, von Willebrand factor (VWF) and thrombomodulin. RESULTS: At baseline, patients with diabetes had higher concentrations of E-Selectin (p=0.041) whereas other biomarkers did not differ between groups. After LCD, E-Selectin, syndecan-1 and VWF were reduced.Two years after surgery, thrombomodulin was unchanged whereas E-Selectin decreased, geometric mean (CV%) 41 (40) to 24 (61) ng/mL, syndecan-1 from 50 (73) to 38 (81) ng/mL and VWF from 120 (52) to 103 (45) %, while hyaluronan increased from 25 (96) to 40 (78) ng/mL (p < 0.001 for all). E-Selectin initially declined faster in patients with diabetes (p<0.003), otherwise the biomarker changes did not differ between groups.Variables with the highest predictive value for improvement in biomarkers were decrease in body weight and fat mass and increase in insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR). CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery is associated with sustained, beneficial alterations in biomarkers of glycocalyx and endothelial function in patients with obesity, both with and without T2D. It is suggested that reduced body weight/fat mass and improved insulin sensitivity are of particular importance for these alterations."

      "abstract": "Bariatric surgery has become the preferred treatment for individuals with morbid obesity. Nutrition is key in optimizing surgical outcomes by reducing risks and enhancing recovery. Preoperative strategies, such as reducing body fat, decreasing liver size, and improving metabolic profiles, have been shown to facilitate safer surgical procedures with fewer complications. This narrative review aims to provide an analysis of the fundamental role of preoperative nutritional management in improving bariatric surgery outcomes, emphasizing the importance of addressing specific nutritional challenges to enhance surgical safety, recovery, and overall health. Preoperative nutritional interventions focus on correcting comorbidities and nutritional deficiencies, particularly hypovitaminosis and micronutrient imbalances, through a multidisciplinary approach involving nutritionists and other healthcare professionals. These interventions not only prepare patients for the physiological demands of surgery but also initiate a period of adaptation to new dietary habits, aiming to improve long-term compliance and mitigate risks such as postoperative weight regain and dumping syndrome. Adopting dietary changes, such as very low-calorie or ketogenic diets 6-12 weeks before surgery, enhances adherence to postoperative restrictions and overall surgical success. Future research should focus on developing comprehensive guidelines for preoperative nutritional care to improve patient outcomes globally.",

      "abstract": "Eating behavior encompasses the psychological, physiological, and environmental factors influencing food intake. Dysregulation in eating behavior, such as emotional eating, binge eating, or loss of satiety signals, contributes to excessive caloric intake and weight gain. These behaviors are often linked to hormonal imbalances, stress, or genetic predisposition. Obesity is a chronic, multifactorial disease characterized by excessive body fat accumulation, with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2 often used for diagnosis. It is associated with significant morbidity, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying obesity include insulin resistance, leptin dysregulation, and altered gut microbiota, which perpetuate metabolic derangements. Lifestyle interventions remain first-line treatment, but sustained weight loss is challenging for many patients. Bariatric surgery is a therapeutic option for individuals with severe obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2 or ≥35 kg/m2 with comorbidities) who have failed conservative management. Procedures such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy alter gastrointestinal anatomy, promoting weight loss through restriction, malabsorption, and hormonal modulation (e.g., increased GLP-1 secretion). Bariatric surgery improves obesity-related comorbidities and enhances quality of life. However, it requires lifelong medical follow-up to address potential nutritional deficiencies and ensure sustainable outcomes.",

      "abstract": "The role of obesity in contributing to inflammation is an influential factor in the progression of obesity-associated medical issues. Metabolic and bariatric surgery has been proven as effective in obtaining weight loss and associated conditions remission. The Systemic Immune Inflammation Index (SII) was developed to offer more comprehensive data on inflammation and is presented as a prognostic indicator regarding many adverse conditions. The present study aimed to investigate the association between SII and bariatric surgery in patients with sarcopenic obesity and evaluate the eventual impact of exercise on SII. All participants were sarcopenic patients with obesity, underwent bariatric surgery - RYGP - and were randomized to participate in a structured physical exercise or to control group. The assessments were performed following standardized procedures, with the data evaluated during routine clinic follow-up at preoperative and 20-weeks postoperative after the exercise program. At baseline, before surgery, patients in both groups had similar anthropometrics, body composition, muscle strength variables and percentage of comorbidities. SII was also similar in both groups. To better understand the association of SII with the different variables, a Pearson correlation test was performed at baseline using SII. There was an inverse association of SII with BMC, handgrip strength and ASMM at baseline, which was maintained 5 months after surgery. At the end of the study, the combined results of the two groups showed that weight, BMI, % of body fat, muscle mass and muscle strength, the 30s sit-to-stand test and bone mineral density all decreased significantly as expected, along with the SII that also decreased significantly. The intervention group showed higher ASMM, handgrip strength, 30s Sit-to-stand test and 400-m walk test and bone mineral density when compared with the control group. However, SII showed no difference between both groups (p > 0.05). The results of the current research show a positive impact of bariatric surgery on weight and associated conditions control and a negative impact on muscle mass and function. SII responded very favorably to surgery with or without exercise, with a clear decrease in its score. Higher SII is associated with lower muscle mass and function, and this may be a reflex of the compromise that obesity causes on health, in this case, increasing systemic inflammation and decreasing muscle mass and function. The role of physical exercise in the management of surgical bariatric patients is still not clear. After surgery, the patients in the physical exercise program group had better results in muscle mass and function when compared to the patients in the control group (without exercise). However, there were no differences in SII score between the two groups, which may be interpreted as a lack of positive effect of physical exercise per se in the short-term on the systemic inflammatory condition present in obesity.",

Identifying potential gender and racial differences in post-surgical OSW and OES, and their associations with psychosocial outcomes, may inform more individualized assessment and treatment for those who have undergone bariatric surgery. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, individuals up to 4 years post-bariatric surgery completed an online survey of various psychosocial outcomes. Overvaluation was examined via the shape and weight overvaluation subscale of the Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), and a modified item was used to assess the overvaluation of excess skin. Quality of life (QOL), depression, and anxiety symptoms were also examined. Gender and racial differences in OSW and OES were examined. Correlations were obtained between OSW/OES, QOL, and psychological symptoms among gender and racial groups. RESULTS: Of 735 participants, women endorsed significantly greater OES than men (p = .008). There were no significant gender differences in OSW. White patients endorsed greater OSW than Black patients (p < .001), and there were no racial differences in OES. OSW and OES were inversely correlated with QOL among all groups. OSW and OES were positively associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms among both racial groups and women. CONCLUSION: Women may be at greater risk for OES than men, while White patients may be at increased risk for OSW. However, OSW/OES related to poorer QOL in all groups, and greater psychological symptoms in women.",
