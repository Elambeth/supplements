      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Approximately 30 % of patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) respond to ketamine; however, no replicable predictors of response have been reported. The imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmissions may be implicated in the mechanism of action of ketamine. This study aimed to evaluate whether the ratio of glutamate and glutamine (Glx) to GABA levels at baseline in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) could predict ketamine response in patients with TRD. METHOD: This exploratory study analyzed data from a double-blind randomized clinical trial with an open-label extension study (jRCTs031210124). Fifteen participants in the ketamine group and 15 of 16 participants in the placebo group received repeated intravenous ketamine during the double-blind and open-label extension periods, respectively. We measured Glx and GABA levels in the dACC before and after treatment during the double-blind period using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) was measured for depressive symptomatology. General linear models were used to examine the relationship between baseline Glx/GABA ratio and HDRS-17 score changes. RESULT: Changes in HDRS-17 scores (mean (±SD)) following ketamine treatment were -4.9 (6.5) and -4.9 (5.2) in the double-blind and open-label periods, respectively. A higher baseline dACC Glx/GABA ratio was correlated with greater improvement in HDRS-17 (β = -0.42, p = 0.040). In the ketamine group, a reduction in the dACC Glx/GABA ratio was correlated with greater HDRS-17 improvement (β = 0.74, p = 0.009) with no such association in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in the dACC may predict the efficacy of ketamine in TRD."

      "abstract": "Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) suppress anti-tumor immunity in tumor bearers, which leads to tumor progression. Immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs) demonstrated significant efficiency against various cancers; however, their success rate is limited to approximately 20-30% in patients with cancer. To address this limitation, predictive biomarkers and combination therapies are required. Since MDSCs are supposed to be crucial for the resistance to ICBs, targeting MDSCs could be a promising approach for cancer immunotherapy. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), widely used as prophylaxis and therapy for febrile neutropenia (FN), has been shown to significantly reduce its incidence. However, G-CSF has been reported to promote tumor progression caused by the enhancing the proliferation of MDSCs. We found that G-CSF enhances the immunosuppressive activity of MDSCs through the upregulation of γ-glutamyltransferase 1 (GGT1). GGT1, an enzyme hydrolyzing extracellular glutathione, is reported to be a marker for early-stage cancers and promote tumor progression. It is suggested that GGT1 increases glutamate levels through glutathione hydrolysis and that metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling enhances the immunosuppressive activity of MDSCs. Moreover, in FN mouse models, we observed that G-CSF promoted tumor progression, while the inhibition of GGT abolished. Together, the inhibition of GGT can mitigate the tumor-promoting effects of MDSCs without compromising the beneficial effect of G-CSF. These insights should lead to the safer and more effective cancer immunotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Amburana cearensis is a plant native to Brazil used in folk medicine for the treatment of several pathological conditions including stroke. Previous research indicates that a dichloromethane extract of A. cearensis seeds (EDAC), rich in coumarins, protects neural cells against oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and glutamate-induced stress. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the role of coumarin, in the protective effect of EDAC. Glutamatergic excitotoxicity is an important cause of neuronal loss involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and ischemic stroke. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the protective effects of coumarin isolated from EDAC against glutamate excitotoxicity in regulating MAPK pathway proteins and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production on PC12 cells. Furthermore, we aimed to investigate the protective effects of coumarin against cell death induced by OGD. We characterized the isolated compound from EDAC as coumarin by 1H and 13C-NMR. Thus, PC12 cells were exposed to OGD or glutamate (20 mM) and/or treated with EDAC or coumarin (500 μg/mL) for 24 h. Subsequently, cell viability was assessed by propidium iodide staining or by MTT test. Furthermore, the expression of MAPK pathway proteins was investigated by Western blot analysis and the expression of cleaved caspase-3 by immunofluorescence. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was assessed by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate and CellROX. We observed that EDAC and coumarin were able to protect PC12 cells against OGD conditions. Moreover, EDAC totally inhibited the glutamate toxicity in PC12 cells. Meanwhile, coumarin mitigated the glutamate toxicity. Both were able to downregulate the expression of ERK1/2 and phosphorylated ERK and inhibit caspase-3 activation. EDAC and coumarin also prevented the increase of ROS induced by treatment with H2O2 or glutamate. Our results evidenced that coumarin from A. cearensis is antioxidative and is an important cytoprotective compound in EDAC against glutamate excitotoxicity or OGD injury."

      "abstract": "Arterial calcification is a powerful predictor of both the events and mortality associated with cardiovascular diseases in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. GLS1 (glutaminase 1), a rate-limiting enzyme catalyzing the conversion of glutamine to glutamate, is disordered in various cardiovascular diseases. However, the potential interplay between GLS1-mediated glutamate production and arterial calcification remains poorly understood. Here, LC-MS/MS analysis of CKD patients' samples shows an abnormally elevated activity of GLS1, reflected by the increased glutamate/glutamine ratio. Moreover, GLS1 activity is positively correlated with arterial calcification progression, and its expression is upregulated in calcified arteries. Treatment with GLS1 inhibitors or knockdown of GLS1 alleviates osteogenic reprogramming. In contrast, glutamate administration boosts the development of arterial calcification. Mechanistically, GLS1 redundancy-regulated glutamate superfluity stimulates the activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDAR), leading to Ca2+ influx and extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) phosphorylation, followed by the nuclear translocation of β-Catenin and acceleration of osteogenic reprogramming of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in further. This research defines GLS1 as a key contributor to arterial calcification. Glutamate, a major product of GLS1-mediated glutamine metabolism, exerts a deleterious effect on arterial calcification by activating NMDAR and subsequently triggering Ca2+ influx, which in turn exacerbates β-Catenin-regulated osteogenic reprogramming in VSMCs."

In plants, GSH homeostasis is managed through the γ-glutamyl cycle, though the genes involved in GSH degradation and recycling are not fully understood. Here, we have characterized the Arabidopsis oxoprolinase 1 (AtOXP1) gene for its role in providing tolerance to arsenite (AsIII) and mercury (Hg) stress. The oxp1 T-DNA mutants showed severe sensitivity to Hg, with significantly lower shoot (~40%) and root (~86%) biomass compared with WT. The mutants accumulated ~45% higher arsenic and Hg accumulation in shoots. The oxp1 mutants also had elevated GSH (2.3-4.0 folds) and oxoproline (5-OP) levels (96%-265%) compared with Col-0 under control and stress conditions. The mutants showed significantly (15%-78%) lower glutamate levels than Col-0 under metal stress. Conversely, relative to WT, AtOXP1 overexpression (OE) lines had significantly higher biomass (18%-43% more) and reduced As (40%) and Hg (19%-35%) accumulation in the shoots. Compared with Col-6, the AtOXP1 OE lines had significantly (44%-57%) lower buildup of GSH levels under both AsIII and Hg treatment. Isotopic analysis revealed that the oxp1 mutants had 29% higher 15N-Glu/Total Glu compared to WT, while OE lines were similar to WT. Additionally, OE lines had significantly higher shoot (15%-22%) and root (~77%) biomass under low nitrogen conditions. The results demonstrate that OXP1 is involved in Glu recycling via GSH degradation and holds the potential to improve plant productivity and reduce toxic metal(loid)s accumulation for food safety.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a notorious superbug responsible for causing 'Gonorrhoea' in humans. Recently, it has been classified as a high-priority pathogen by the World Health Organization due to its increasing resistance to available antibiotics. A multi-prolonged approach is needed to combat the growing problem of drug resistance caused by N. gonorrhoeae. This study evaluates Glutamate Racemase (GR), a moonlighting protein of N. gonorrhoeae (Ng- GR), as a novel therapeutic target with potential for both inhibitor design and peptide vaccine development. Ng-GR plays a crucial role in the peptidoglycan biosynthetic pathway and is highly conserved across bacterial species. Additionally, this protein moonlights to perform a secondary function by binding to DNA gyrase in various organisms. METHOD: Homology modeling, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations were used to design inhibitors targeting the moonlight function of Ng-GR. The immunogenicity of this protein was assessed using ABCPred-2.0, BepiPred-2.0, and ProPred software. RESULTS: Bisleucocurine A was found to bind at the ectopic site of Ng-GR, disrupting its crucial moonlight function and interfering with the interaction between Ng-GR and N. gonorroheae DNA Gyrase (Ng-gyrase). Interestingly, residues important for its moonlight function were also identified as key immunogenic sites using ABCPred-2.0, BepiPred-2.0, and ProPred software, enhancing the potential of this protein as a vaccine candidate. CONCLUSION: The GR enzyme's moonlight function is highlighted as a promising novel target for therapeutic intervention and vaccine development in N. gonorrohoeae."

      "abstract": "Emerging evidence implicates gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of obesity-related depression (OD); however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain inadequately explored. This study compared the microbial and transcriptional profiles between patients with OD and healthy individuals. The results revealed an enrichment of Anaerotruncus colihominis (A. colihominis) and glutamate metabolism-related genes in the OD group. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from patients with OD induced weight gain, compromised barrier function, and intensified depression-like behaviors in high-fat diet (HFD) mice. Microbial analysis in the mice feces corroborated the clinical findings. Single-cell RNA sequencing highlighted the pivotal role of the Efnb2-Ephb2 interaction in cell communication among colon epithelial and hippocampal neuron subtypes in OD mice. Notably, A. colihominis correlated with glutamate levels in the OD mice and patients. It produced glutamate through a glutamic acid metabolism-related DNA sequence, verified in an engineered Escherichia coli MG1655 strain. Both A. colihominis and glutamate reduced barrier proteins in colon epithelial cells and modulated cognitive proteins in neurons. Finally, A. colihominis treatment induced the Efnb2-Ephb2 interaction, exacerbating depression-like behaviors in germ-free HFD mice. Collectively, these findings reveal that A. colihominis and glutamate are potential intervention targets for OD treatment."

      "abstract": "Epilepsy encompasses a group of chronic brain disorders characterized by recurrent, hypersynchronous activity of neuronal clusters, with epileptic seizures being the primary manifestation of these disorders. The objective of epilepsy treatment is to prevent seizures with minimum adverse side effects. However, approximately 30 % of patients do not respond to available medications. One proposed mechanism of epileptogenesis is glutamate excitotoxicity. When released in excess or not appropriately removed from the synaptic cleft, glutamate hyperactivates receptors, causing a biochemical cascade, which culminates in seizures and cell death. The use of animal models is essential for uncovering potential epileptogenic pathways, understanding the role of receptors and transporters in excitotoxicity, and screening effective antiepileptic treatments. This review examines studies that investigate the role of glutamate transporters and receptors in excitotoxicity and epileptogenesis using animal models. For this, we searched through both PubMed/Medline and ScienceDirect databases. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 26 (twenty-six) studies were selected for analysis. The studies addressed key glutamate transporter family of excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) EAAT1, EAAT2, and EAAT3, responsible for glutamate clearance, as well as AMPA receptor subunits GluA1 and GluA2, NMDA receptor subunits GluN1, GluN2a, and GluN2b, and the metabotropic receptors mGluR5 and mGluR2/3. Results showed that the dysregulation of these transporters and receptors is associated to seizure induction and excitotoxic damage, pointing to their fundamental role in the mechanisms of excitotoxicity and epileptogenesis. These findings highlight the potential of targeting glutamate transporters and receptors to stabilize glutamate homeostasis as an intervention in epilepsy management."

      "abstract": "Recurrent and intense headache is a well appreciated cardinal feature of migraine, a common and incapacitating neurological disorder. Often, there are associated canonical sensory abnormalities, such as light and sound sensitivity, as well as associated nausea. Given this phenotype of disordered sensory processing and, in a third of patients, the phenomenon called aura accompanying migraine attacks, it has been suggested that the pathophysiology of migraine is likely to involve glutamate, the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS). Glutamate plays a role in nociception, central sensitization, and cortical spreading depression (CSD), three processes that are deemed important in migraine biology. With an emphasis on the therapeutic potential of targeting various glutamate receptors in migraine, this review will discuss the currently available literature and emerging findings on the role of targeting glutamatergic pathways for the treatment of migraine. A thorough literature review was carried out on the functions of both metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), and the ionotropic glutamate receptors (NMDA, AMPA, and kainate) in migraine pathogenesis. The ever-present need for new treatments, the role of glutamate in the migraine aura phenomenon, and the consequences of monogenic migraine mutations on mediating prolonged, complex, or permanent aura are all discussed, culminating in a suggestion that glutamatergic targeting may hold particular promise in the management of migraine aura. There are plausible roles for metabotropic receptors in regulating pain processing in important migraine-related brain structures, like the thalamus and trigeminal nucleus. Similarly, ionotropic receptors contribute to excitatory neurotransmission and neuronal hyperexcitability. Recent studies have shown preclinical and early clinical results for treatments targeting these receptors, but there are still significant issues with treatment response, including drug transport, side effects, and efficacy. With ongoing and emerging discoveries in the field, there is increasing promise of new migraine medications targeting glutamate receptors. For bench to bedside translation in this area, continued study of the molecular basis of migraine, receptor subtypes, and exploration of potential drug delivery methods are needed.",

METHODS: Data, including demographics, symptoms, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), were retrospectively collected from two patients with informed consent at Xiangya Hospital from February 2024 to October 2024. Autoantibodies associated with autoimmune encephalitis were tested using cell-based assays. The literature describing anti-mGluR2 antibody-related diseases was searched for in PubMed and five cases were reviewed. RESULTS: Two cases of anti-mGluR2 antibody-related diseases were reported: one with acute cerebellitis and the other with refractory seizures. Brain MRI showed cerebellar involvement in the cerebellitis patient. Anti-mGluR2 antibodies were detected in the serum but not in the CSF of both cases, and both responded well to immunotherapy. A review of five patients (all female, aged 3-78 years) found four with cerebellar ataxia or cerebellitis and one with immune-related epilepsy. Common symptoms included dysarthria, gait instability, and gaze/nystagmus, while seizures were rare. MRI revealed cerebellar involvement in most cases. Anti-mGluR2 antibodies were present in the serum of all patients but only in the CSF of two. Three patients responded well to immunosuppressive treatment, and two had malignancies. CONCLUSION: Anti-mGluR2 antibody-related diseases are autoimmune disorders primarily characterized by ataxic manifestations, though seizures may also occur. The effectiveness of immunosuppressive treatment is uncertain and screening for tumors is necessary."

Twenty-four male Wistar albino rats were divided into four groups for control or treatment with MSG (2 g/kg body weight) and/or Pls (100 mg/kg body weight). All doses were received orally for 28 days. Results show that plasmalogens ameliorate the levels of glucose, insulin, lipids, oxidative stress markers, antioxidant enzymes, AKT, and neurochemical markers. It also reduces the level of the inflammatory markers TNF-α, NF-κB, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Histological and immunohistochemical alterations in hippocampal tissues were found to be augmented postexposure to Pls, suggesting that Pls have a potent ameliorative effect. We conclude that Pls exert anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiapoptotic effects and counteract MSG-induced neurotoxicity by altering the NF-κB and p38 MAPK signaling pathways.",

      "abstract": "Enzymatic browning is one of the most troublesome issues for fresh-cut fruits and vegetables, as it not only reduces product quality and shelf life but also causes great waste and economic loss. Although many antibrowning technologies have been explored, few noncontact methods have been reported. In particular, the effect of using glutamate (Glu) is unknown. This study revealed that Glu treatment of whole tubers significantly reduced browning in fresh-cut potatoes. This whole-tuber Glu induction under optimal conditions (1 % Glu for 12 h) produced a brighter colour and better sensory quality than soaking slices in solutions of Glu or ascorbic acid. Notably, Glu induction led to increased jasmonic acid (JA) and jasmonate-isoleucine (JA-Ile) accumulation. The activities of 12-oxophytodienoic acid reductase 3 (OPR3), jasmonate-resistant 1 (JAR1), and coronatine-insensitive 1 (COI1) in the jasmonate synthesis pathway and the expression of their corresponding genes also increased. Additionally, phenylpropane metabolism was upregulated, as evidenced by increased levels of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), 4-coumaric acid coenzyme a ligase (4CL), phenolic compounds and flavonoids. Moreover, the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-redox balance improved, the contents of hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde (MDA) decreased, and the catalase (CAT) activity and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl radical (DPPH) scavenging capacity increased. Finally, Glu induction increased microbiological safety, resulting in a lower total bacterial count. Thus, Glu induction may modulate jasmonic acid synthesis and signalling, regulate phenylpropane metabolism and the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-redox balance, and ultimately slow browning and improve storage quality in fresh-cut potatoes. This is the first report of a noncontact browning control technique involving Glu, which provides new ideas for the fresh-cut industry."

Furthermore, the relationship between GABAA-receptor availability and rTMS outcomes remains largely unexplored. In this study, GABA and glutamate levels in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) were measured using a 1H-MRS MEGA-PRESS sequence in 42 patients with bipolar or unipolar depression, both before and after a sham-controlled, double-blind clinical trial involving intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) over the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. A subset of 28 patients also underwent [11C]flumazenil positron emission tomography (PET) to measure whole-brain GABAA-receptor availability and mean receptor availability in the nucleus accumbens and dACC. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the self-rated Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S). The results indicated no significant changes in neurotransmitter levels or GABAA-receptor availability post-iTBS in either the active or sham conditions. However, changes in MADRS-S scores after active iTBS were positively correlated with changes in GABA levels in the dACC (r(13) = 0.54, p = 0.04) and baseline GABAA-receptor availability in the nucleus accumbens (r(11) = 0.66, p = 0.02). These correlations were absent in the sham group. The findings suggest that a reduction in GABA within targeted frontostriatal circuits can be part of the antidepressant mechanism of iTBS, challenging previous research. Additionally, they indicate a potential predictive role for frontostriatal GABAA-receptor availability in the treatment of depression using dorsomedial prefrontal iTBS.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Alcohol use and major depressive disorder are frequently comorbid, with individuals diagnosed with a substance use disorder being nearly three times as likely to have major depression. Poor treatment responses are found for both disorders and are further complicated when they co-occur, underscoring the need for better therapies. One potential candidate is ketamine, which has been shown to have rapid and long-lasting effects in individuals with treatment-resistant depression and, in some studies, reduces drinking in alcohol use disorder. However, though women are more likely to have this comorbidity, few studies have examined sex-specific effects of ketamine on alcohol drinking, nor have studies assessed the potential for ketamine to reduce reinstatement of alcohol seeking. OBJECTIVES: The primary goal of the present studies was to determine the effects of ketamine on alcohol-motivated behaviors in male and female rats, including in a model of stress + cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking using yohimbine (YOH). RESULTS: We found a selective reduction in alcohol self-administration and YOH + cue-induced reinstatement in females, but not males at a dose of 10 mg/kg ketamine. However, the same dose of ketamine was effective in reducing YOH + cue-induced reinstatement of saccharin seeking in both sexes. In addition, a different NMDAR antagonist, memantine, was effective in reducing alcohol seeking in both sexes, while the ketamine metabolite hydroxynorketamine (HNK) had no effects. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, these data suggest that antagonism of NMDARs may be effective in reducing stress-related alcohol seeking, but that ketamine has unique properties that lead to female-specific effects on alcohol seeking."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Glutamate is implicated in playing a crucial role in modulating the complex pathophysiological mechanisms of migraines, including central or peripheral sensitization, cortical spreading depression, and pain transmission. With expanding knowledge over the last three decades, glutamate receptors have become focal points in neurological drug research. Altered plasma glutamate levels during migraines suggest a potential avenue for effective therapies targeting glutamate reduction. Furthermore, glutamate is believed to play a vital role in modulating the complex pathophysiological mechanisms underlying migraines. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide an overview of the ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists (NMDA, AMPA, and Kainate receptors) and metabotropic glutamate receptors in the context of migraines. We explore the advantages and disadvantages of these receptor modulators as alternative treatments, considering efficacy, tolerability, and safety. METHODS: We conducted comprehensive online searches across various electronic databases, with a primary focus on PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov, to gather the latest treatment approaches and emerging concepts. RESULTS: A total of 371 articles were identified from PubMed, along with 69 articles from clinicaltrials. gov. After refinement, 113 articles were included. We summarize seven different medications currently in clinical practice for migraines and highlight six items for migraine therapy in preclinical trials and their potential value. CONCLUSION: It's crucial to note that these agents pose certain challenges in specific drug research due to their intricate influence and mechanisms of action within multiple neuronal pathways. Therefore, further studies are warranted to elucidate more specific glutamatergic signaling pathways for migraine therapy while minimizing interference with normal neuronal functions."

Understanding the molecular mechanisms of cotton responses to these stresses is crucial for improve yield and fiber quality. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome dynamics under salt and salt-alkali stress conditions, utilizing 234 RNA-seq datasets compiled from 11 previous studies. After systematic evaluation and correction for batch effects, we observed that root transcriptomes clustered more consistently than leaf transcriptomes across stress treatment and time points. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) on 123 root transcriptomes identified three key modules, with their hub genes significantly associated with salt and salt-alkali tolerance. Virus-induced gene silencing assay and RNA-seq analysis indicated that GhGDH2_D03 (Gohir.D03G104800), a module hub gene encoding Glutamate Dehydrogenase 2, positively regulates salt and salt-alkali tolerance in cotton by modulating multiple signaling pathways and metabolic processes, including the ethylene signaling pathway. This study underscores the pivotal role of GhGDH2_D03 in conferring tolerance to salt and salt-alkali stress, in addition to its previous reported involvement in biotic stress defense, providing valuable insights and genetic resources for cotton breeding.",

Accurate CDI diagnosis is essential for timely treatment and infection control. Laboratory diagnosis of CDI commonly involves the detection of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and/or toxins A and B by immunoassays or the toxin genes by nucleic acid amplification. This study assesses the performance of a new commercial test, the Sofia® 2 C. difficile Fluorescent Immunoassay (Sofia 2; FIA; QuidelOrtho), for detecting C. difficile GDH and toxins. METHODS: Sofia 2 was compared to enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) C. diff Quik Chek Complete (Techlab Inc.) and Immunocard (Meridian Bioscience) using remnant stool samples from 262 patients with suspected CDI. RESULTS: Sofia 2 demonstrated high agreement with the EIA methods for GDH (positive percentage agreement (PPA): 100%, negative percentage agreement (NPA): 94%, overall percentage of agreement (OPA): 95%) and toxins (PPA: 100%, NPA: 99%, OPA: 99%) detection. Compared to standard-of-care (SOC) testing including toxin gene PCR with the following toxin antigen test, Sofia 2 demonstrates strong PPA (100%), NPA (98%), positive predictive value (71%), and negative predictive value (100%). CONCLUSIONS: Sofia 2 C. difficile FIA generates rapid results that are comparable to other commercial immunoassays with a simple workflow, supporting its use for CDI diagnosis in clinical practice."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline and synaptic dysfunction, largely driven by amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. These pathological hallmarks disrupt glutamate signaling, which is essential for synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. This study investigates the therapeutic potential of melatonin on memory and synaptic plasticity in an AD-like mouse model, with a focus on its regulatory effects on glutamate homeostasis and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). METHODS: The study began with an in-silico bioinformatics analysis of RNA-seq datasets from hippocampal tissues of AD patients to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to glutamate signaling and tau pathology. An AD-like model was induced via intra-hippocampal injection of cis-phospho tau in C57BL/6 mice. Memory function was assessed using behavioral tests. Synaptic plasticity was evaluated using in vitro field potential recording of hippocampal slices. Histological analyses included Nissl staining for neuronal density, Luxol Fast Blue for myelin integrity, and immunofluorescence for tau hyperphosphorylation. Molecular studies employed qPCR and Western blot to assess glutamate-related markers and tau phosphorylation. Melatonin (10 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally, starting either two weeks (early intervention) or four weeks (late intervention) post-induction. RESULTS: Key molecular targets in glutamate signaling pathways were identified using bioinformatics. AD-like mice displayed memory deficits and synaptic dysfunction. Melatonin improved cognitive function, especially with early intervention, as confirmed by behavioral tests. Histological studies revealed reduced neuronal loss, improved myelin integrity, and decreased tau hyperphosphorylation. Molecular findings showed restored mGluR expression and reduced GSK3 activity. Early intervention yielded superior outcomes, with partial restoration of synaptic plasticity observed in LTP recordings. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the neuroprotective properties of melatonin, mediated by its ability to modulate glutamate signaling and mGluR activity, offering new insights into its potential as a therapeutic agent for AD. Additionally, the results suggest that earlier administration of melatonin may significantly enhance its efficacy, highlighting the importance of timely intervention in neurodegenerative diseases.",

Proline, functioning as an osmotic regulator, has been proposed as an effective strategy for enhancing plant tolerance to salt stress. This study aimed to investigate the effects of exogenous proline on salt tolerance in soybeans. A hydroponic experiment was conducted with different salt treatments (without NaCl, -NaCl; with 100 mM NaCl, +NaCl) and with or without 150 mM proline (+Pro, -Pro). The results showed that proline application alleviated salt stress-induced reductions in plant growth, photosynthetic parameters, and chlorophyll content while aiding recovery from leaf chlorosis. Proline treatment improved ion homeostasis by reducing Na+ levels and increasing K+ and Ca2+ contents in the leaves. Salt stress increased malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, along with leaf peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) activities, while decreasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Moreover, salt stress obviously enhanced proline accumulation, accompanied by increases in glutamate (Glu), glutamate-1-semialdehyde (GSA), and pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) content, as well as the activities of pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS) and pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (P5CR) in the glutamate pathway, while reducing proline dehydrogenase (ProDH) activity. Exogenous proline treatment further elevated proline content and increased key substances and enzyme activities in both the glutamate (Glu and P5C content, P5CS and P5CR activity) and ornithine (Orn content and OAT activity) pathways while also reducing ProDH activity. Collectively, our results revealed that exogenous proline contributed to an attenuation of salt stress in soybeans by regulating both the glutamate and ornithine pathways to stimulate endogenous proline accumulation, mediate Na+/K+ homeostasis, and inhibit oxidative damage.",

OBJECTIVES: This study investigates the effects of coenzyme Q10 (Co-Q10) on cognitive performance, antioxidant defense, cholinergic activity, and hippocampal neuron damage in rats rendered obese by monosodium glutamate (MSG) exposure. METHODS: Forty-eight neonatal male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups: Control, MSG, MSG + Q10-10, and MSG + Q10-20. Monosodium glutamate (4 g/kg BW) was administered subcutaneously into the cervical region from postnatal day (PND) 2 to PND 10. Coenzyme Q10 (10 mg/kg BW and 20 mg/kg BW) was administered intraperitoneally from PND 30 to PND 42. At the end of the treatment period, working memory and avoidance learning tests were conducted. Anthropometric data were collected, followed by evaluations of hippocampal catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. The density of apoptotic/dark neurons (DN) in the CA₁ and CA₃ regions of the hippocampus was also assessed. RESULTS: Monosodium glutamate treatment increased Body Mass Index (BMI) and Lee Index, impaired working memory and avoidance learning, and reduced CAT, SOD, and GPx activities. Additionally, MSG exposure led to elevated MDA levels, increased AChE activity, and higher DN density in the CA₁ and CA₃ hippocampal regions. Treatment with Co-Q10 resulted in a decrease in BMI, enhanced memory and learning, noteworthy increases in CAT, SOD, and GPx activities in the hippocampus, and reductions in MDA levels, AChE activity, and DN density in the CA₁ and CA₃ regions. CONCLUSIONS: Coenzyme Q10 mitigates hippocampal neuronal damage and improves cognitive function in MSG-induced obesity, primarily through its antioxidant and AChE inhibitory properties."

Using proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H-MRS), this study aimed to determine whether lower pretreatment GABA and Glx levels in the medial frontal cortex, a region implicated in MDD pathophysiology, are associated with better antidepressant treatment response. Participants with MDD (N = 74) were antidepressant naïve or medication-free for at least three weeks before imaging. Two MEGA-PRESS 1H-MRS acquisitions were collected, interleaved with a water unsuppressed reference scan. GABA and Glx concentrations were quantified from an average difference spectrum, with preprocessing using Gannet and spectral fitting using TARQUIN. Following imaging, participants were randomized to escitalopram or placebo for 8 weeks in a double-blind design. Multivariable logistic regression models were applied with treatment type and age as covariates. Bayes Factor hypothesis testing was used to interpret the strength of the evidence. No significant association was found between pretreatment Glx, GABA, or Glx/GABA and depression remission status or the continuous outcome, percent change in symptom severity. In an exploratory analysis, no significant correlation was found between pretreatment Glx, GABA or Glx/GABA and days to response. Bayes factor analysis showed strong evidence towards the null hypotheses in all cases. To date, there are no replicated biomarkers in psychiatry. To address this, well-powered, placebo-controlled trials need to be undertaken and reported. The present analysis suggests pretreatment GABA, Glx, or their ratio cannot predict antidepressant treatment response.

      "abstract": "The serotonergic psychedelics psilocybin, LSD and DMT hold great promise for the development of new treatments for psychiatric conditions such as major depressive disorder, addiction and end-of-life anxiety. Previous studies in both animals and humans have confirmed the effects of these drugs on neuronal activity and plasticity. However, the understanding of the mechanisms of action of these substances is limited. Here we show rapid effects of psychedelics on presynaptic properties, using live cell imaging at the level of single synapses in primary rat cortical neurons. Using the genetically encoded reporter of synaptic vesicle fusion synaptopHluorin, we detected a reduced fraction of synaptic vesicles that fused in response to mild or strong electrical stimulation 3-30 min after application of serotonergic psychedelics. These effects were transient and no longer present 24 h after treatment. While DMT only reduced the total recycling pool, LSD and psilocin also reduced the size of the readily releasable vesicle pool. Imaging with the sensors for glutamate, iGluSnFR, and presynaptic calcium, synGCaMP6, showed that while psilocin and DMT increased evoked glutamate release, LSD and psilocin reduced evoked presynaptic calcium levels. Interestingly, psilocin also affected short-term plasticity leading to a depression of responses to paired stimuli. The rapid and drug-specific modulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission described in this study may contribute to distinct anxiolytic and antidepressant properties of serotonergic psychedelics.",

      "abstract": "Glioblastoma is a highly malignant and invasive type of primary brain tumor that originates from astrocytes. Glutamate, a neurotransmitter in the brain plays a crucial role in excitotoxic cell death. Excessive glutamate triggers a pathological process known as glutamate excitotoxicity, leading to neuronal damage. This excitotoxicity contributes to neuronal death and tumor necrosis in glioblastoma, resulting in seizures and symptoms such as difficulty in concentrating, low energy, depression, and insomnia. Glioblastoma cells, derived from astrocytes, fail to maintain glutamate-glutamine homeostasis, releasing excess glutamate into the extracellular space. This glutamate activates ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors on nearby neurons, causing hyperexcitability and triggering apoptosis through caspase activation. Additionally, glioblastoma cells possess calcium-permeable AMPA receptors, which are activated by glutamate in an autocrine manner. This activation increases intracellular calcium levels, triggering various signaling pathways. Alkylating agent temozolomide has been used to counteract glutamate excitotoxicity, but its efficacy in directly combating excitotoxicity is limited due to the development of resistance in glioblastoma cells. There is an unmet need for alternative biochemical agents that can have the greatest impact on reducing glutamate excitotoxicity in glioblastoma. In this review, we discuss the mechanism and various signaling pathways involved in glutamate excitotoxicity in glioblastoma cells. We also examine the roles of various receptor and transporter proteins, in glutamate excitotoxicity and highlight biochemical agents that can mitigate glutamate excitotoxicity in glioblastoma and serve as potential therapeutic agents.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The ionotropic glutamate receptor AMPA (AMPAR) mediates fast excitatory synaptic transmission and regulates synaptic strength in various parts of the CNS. Emotional challenges can affect these processes by influencing AMPAR levels and localization via stress hormones, resulting, e.g., in behavioral changes. AMPARs are essential for auditory processing, but their response to stress hormones in the central or peripheral auditory system remains poorly understood. Therefore, this scoping review examines the effects of corticosterone (CORT), a primary stress hormone in rodents, on AMPA receptor levels and localization in the rodent nervous system and considers potential implications for the auditory system. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, and OVID EMBASE using MeSH terms related to AMPA receptors and corticosterone. Studies were screened based on predefined inclusion criteria, including original research published in English that focused on AMPA receptor subunits (e.g., GluR1-4, GluA1-4, Gria1-4). Of 288 articles screened, 17 met the criteria for final analysis. RESULTS: No reports were found regarding CORT action in the auditory system. Three main experimental models used in the included research were identified: neuronal cultures, isolated tissue cultures, and animal models. Generally, short-term CORT exposure increases AMPAR surface localization and mobility in neuronal cultures, especially in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. However, results from animal models were inconsistent due to variations in experimental design and other factors. The isolated tissue study did not provide sufficient data for clear conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: Variability in experimental models limits our ability to draw definitive conclusions about the effects of CORT on AMPARs across different regions of the nervous system. The differences in live animal studies highlight the need for standardized methods and reporting. Since AMPARs play a crucial role in auditory processing, CORT-induced changes in neuronal cultures may occur in the auditory system. Further research is needed to explore the specific responses of AMPAR subunits and how stress hormones may influence auditory disorders, which could help identify potential treatment strategies."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: To investigate the associations of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) with tau deposition and cognitive ability in patients with early Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Twenty-six cognitively impaired (CI) and 14 cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals underwent mGluR5 positron emission tomography (PET) ([18F]PSS232), amyloid PET ([18F]florbetapir), and tau PET ([18F]MK6240), and neuropsychological assessment. The relationships among mGluR5 availability, tau deposition, and neuropsychological assessment were analyzed using Spearman's correlation and mediation analyses. RESULTS: CI patients had lower mGluR5 in the hippocampus than CU (standardized uptake value ratio [SUVr]: 2.03 ± 0.25 vs 1.79 ± 0.17, p = 0.003). Hippocampal mGluR5 was negatively associated with hippocampal tau deposition (r = -.46, p = 0.003) and positively associated with cognitive performance, but only in women. Hippocampal tau deposition mediated the effect of mGluR5 on cognitive performance. DISCUSSION: Reduced hippocampal mGluR5 is negatively related with tau deposition in most cortical regions and positively associated with cognitive performance, making it a promising biomarker for AD diagnosis and therapy. HIGHLIGHTS: Cognitively impaired (CI) patients exhibited lower metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) availability in the hippocampus than cognitively unimpaired (CU) subjects. Hippocampal mGluR5 availability was negatively associated with tau deposition in widespread cortex. Hippocampal mGluR5 availability was positively associated with cognitive performance. The close association of mGluR5 with tau and cognition performance exists only in females. Tau pathology mediated the relationship between mGluR5 availability and cognition.",

      "abstract": "Glutamate is a critical excitatory neurotransmitter involved in numerous cellular functions. However, excessive glutamate release can lead to neuronal cell death through oxidative stress, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders. Therefore, strategies aimed at preventing oxidative stress have emerged as promising therapeutic approaches. Macrostemonoside T (MST), a novel steroidal saponin isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine Allii Macrostemon Bulbus, has demonstrated significant antioxidant activity in previous studies. Nevertheless, its neuroprotective effects against oxidative damage and the underlying molecular mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we established a glutamate-induced cell injury model using mouse hippocampal neurons (HT22) to investigate the neuroprotective effects of MST and explore its potential mechanisms. A variety of techniques, including DCFH-DA staining, JC-1 staining, Hoechst 33,258 staining, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining, ELISA, Western blot analysis, and molecular docking, were employed. The results demonstrated that MST treatment significantly improved the survival of HT22 cells exposed to glutamate. Moreover, MST treatment markedly reduced intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde while enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. MST also mitigated mitochondrial dysfunction by inhibiting mitochondrial fission and preserving mitochondrial membrane potential. Additionally, MST reduced excessive autophagy by decreasing autophagy markers and inhibiting the transition from LC3I to LC3II. Furthermore, MST decreased apoptosis rates, lowered pro-apoptotic protein BAX levels, increased the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, and inhibited the release of apoptosis-inducing factors from mitochondria. Molecular docking analysis showed that MST enhanced PKA activity by blocking endogenous inhibition of PKA, which in turn activated the PKA/CREB/BDNF signalling pathway. Subsequent validation using immunofluorescence and Western blotting further confirmed that MST treatment significantly reversed the glutamate-induced reduction of PRKACA, CREB, p-CREB, and BDNF protein levels. In conclusion, MST is a potent neuroprotective agent that ameliorates glutamate-induced neuronal damage by inhibiting oxidative stress, alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction, reducing autophagy and apoptosis, and activating the PKA/CREB/BDNF signaling pathway.",

Recent studies have indicated that inhibition of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) may alleviate hepatic steatosis. However, the precise mechanism warrants further exploration. AIM: To investigate the potential mechanism by which mGluR5 attenuates hepatocyte steatosis in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Free fatty acids (FFAs)-stimulated HepG2 cells were treated with the mGluR5 antagonist MPEP and the mGluR5 agonist CHPG. Oil Red O staining and a triglyceride assay kit were used to evaluate lipid content. Western blot analysis was conducted to detect the expression of the autophagy-associated proteins p62 and LC3-II, as well as the expression of the key signaling molecules AMPK and ULK1, in the treated cells. To further elucidate the contributions of autophagy and AMPK, we used chloroquine (CQ) to inhibit autophagy and compound C (CC) to inhibit AMPK activity. In parallel, wild-type mice and mGluR5 knockout (KO) mice fed a normal chow diet or a high-fat diet (HFD) were used to evaluate the effect of mGluR5 inhibition in vivo. RESULTS: mGluR5 inhibition by MPEP attenuated hepatocellular steatosis and increased LC3-II and p62 protein expression. The autophagy inhibitor CQ reversed the effects of MPEP. In addition, MPEP promoted AMPK and ULK1 expression in HepG2 cells exposed to FFAs. MPEP treatment led to the nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB, which is known to promote p62 expression. This effect was negated by the AMPK inhibitor CC. mGluR5 KO mice presented reduced body weight, improved glucose tolerance and reduced hyperlipidemia when fed a HFD. Additionally, the livers of HFD-fed mGluR5 KO mice presented increases in LC3-II and p62. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that mGluR5 inhibition promoted autophagy and reduced hepatocyte steatosis through activation of the AMPK signaling pathway. These findings reveal a new functional mechanism of mGluR5 as a target in the treatment of MASLD.",

In rat cerebrocortical synaptosomes, lupeol reduced glutamate release in a manner that could be blocked by extracellular Ca2+-free medium or P/Q-type Ca2+ channel antagonism. The synaptosomal membrane potential was not affected by lupeol treatment. Docking data also revealed that lupeol formed a hydrogen bond with amino acid residues of the P/Q-type Ca2+ channel. In the KA-induced acute excitotoxicity model, lupeol pretreatment ameliorated cortical neurodegeneration and downregulated the expression of glutamate release-related proteins vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) and phospho-synapsin I, thereby reducing the glutamate levels in the cortices of rats. Our findings suggest that lupeol may exert a neuroprotective effect by reducing glutamate excitotoxicity through the inhibition of presynaptic glutamate release.

This study aimed to explore the mechanisms of Artemisinin (Art) antagonizing cognitive disorder in HUA by suppressing pyroptosis. A mouse model of HUA was established by intraperitoneal injection of 300 mg/kg potassium oxonate (PO) in C57BL/6 mice for 14 days. The mice were simultaneously treated with Art, an agonist of pyroptosis Polyphyllin VI (PPVI), or glutamate receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) knockdown lentiviral plasmid. After treatment, serum uric acid, IL-6, and TNF-ɑ levels were examined, as well as hippocampal IL-1β and IL-18 levels, and the cognitive function of mice was assessed by the Morris water maze test. Pathological changes in the CA1 of the hippocampus were observed. Cleave-caspase-1, GSDMD-N, and GRIP1 protein level in the hippocampus was quantified by western blot. After PO induction, the escape latency and the time spent in the target quadrant increased in mice, cell arrangement in CA1 hippocampus was loose and disorganized, with obvious inflammatory infiltration and serious damage being observed, and the mouse hippocampus had elevated cleaved-caspase-1, GSDMD-N, IL-1β, and IL-18. Art treatment reduced pyroptosis in the hippocampus and improved cognitive disorder in HUA mice. Administration of PPVI aggravated cognitive disorder in Art-treated HUA mice, and Art improved cognitive dysfunction in HUA mice by inhibiting pyroptosis through upregulation of GRIP1. Art blunts pyroptosis in the hippocampus of HUA mice suffering from cognitive disorder by upregulating GRIP1.",

The isolation of single gene mutations that both extend lifespan and improve age-related health have identified potential targets for therapeutic intervention to alleviate age-related morbidity. Here, we find that genetic loss of function of the G protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptor (DmGluRA) in Drosophila extends the lifespan of female flies. This longevity phenotype was accompanied by lower basal levels of oxidative stress and improved stress tolerance, and differences in early-life behavioural markers. Gene expression changes in DmGluRA mutants identified reduced ribosome biogenesis, a hallmark of longevity, as a key process altered in these animals. We further show that the pro-longevity effects of reduced DmGluRA signalling are dependent on the fly homologue of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), an important regulator of ribosomal protein translation. Importantly, we can recapitulate lifespan extension using a specific pharmacological inhibitor of mGluR activity. Hence, our study identifies metabotropic glutamate receptors as potential targets for age-related therapeutics."

      "abstract": "The metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGlu5) and adenosine A(2A) receptor form a mutually inhibitory heteromer with the dopamine D2 receptor, where the activation of either mGlu5 or A(2A) leads to reduced D2 signaling. This study investigated whether a mGlu5-positive allosteric modulator (PAM) or an A(2A) agonist treatment could mitigate sensorimotor gating deficits and alter cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) levels in a rodent neonatal quinpirole (NQ) model of psychosis. F0 Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with neonatal saline or quinpirole (1 mg/kg) from postnatal day 1 to 21 and bred to produce an F1 generation. F1 offspring underwent prepulse inhibition (PPI) testing from postnatal day 44 to 48 to assess sensorimotor gating. The rats were treated with mGlu5 PAM 3-Cyano-N-(1,3-diphenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl) benzamide (CDPPB) or A(2A) agonist CGS21680. Rats with at least one NQ-treated parent showed PPI deficits, which were alleviated by both CDPPB and CGS21680. Sex differences were noted across groups, with CGS21680 showing greater efficacy than CDPPB. Additionally, CREB levels were elevated in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and both CDPPB and CGS21680 reduced CREB expression to control levels. These findings suggest that targeting the adenosinergic and glutamatergic systems alleviates sensorimotor gating deficits and abnormal CREB signaling, both of which are associated with psychosis.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a severe brain disorder that usually produces a lifetime of disability. Related research shows activating metabotropic glutamate receptors holds therapeutic potential. Agonist-positive allosteric modulations (ago-PAMs) not only activate metabotropic glutamate receptors but also enhance glutamate-induced responses, offering a promising treatment strategy. However, the molecular mechanisms by which ago-PAM enhances glutamate-induced responses remain unclear, as does the potential influence of glutamate on ago-PAM. In this study, Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics and tau random acceleration molecular dynamics simulations were employed to investigate the molecular mechanism between ago-PAM and glutamate in full-length mGlu2. Results suggest that the ago-PAM JNJ-46281222 enhances the binding affinity and residence time of glutamates in the Venus flytrap (VFT) domains by initiating a variant reverse communication from the heptahelical transmembrane (7TM) domains to VFTs via the cysteine-rich domains. Meanwhile, glutamate facilitates the interaction between Trp676 and Glu701 to further induce the relaxation of TM5, promoting the opening of the PAM-binding pocket. Glutamate can also promote the upward rotation of the cyclopropylmethyl group of the JNJ-46281222 to bring the TM6-TM6 distance closer. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain how the binding between mGlu2 and G protein differs when induced by small molecules binding in allosteric sites, orthosteric sites, or both. In conclusion, this study shed new light on the positive coordination relationship between ago-PAM and glutamate in the full-length mGlu2 receptor, which could help develop novel and more effective ago-PAM to treat schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous findings in psychosis have revealed mixed findings on glutamate (Glu) levels in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Factors such as illness chronicity, methodology, and medication status have impeded a more nuanced evaluation of Glu in psychosis. The goal of this longitudinal neuroimaging study was to investigate the role of antipsychotics on Glu in the dACC in antipsychotic-naïve first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients. METHODS: We enrolled 117 healthy controls (HCs) and 113 antipsychotic-naïve FEP patients for this study. 3T proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS; PRESS; TE = 80 ms) data from a voxel prescribed in the dACC were collected from all participants at baseline, 6, and 16 weeks following antipsychotic treatment. Glutamate levels were quantified using the QUEST algorithm and analyzed longitudinally using linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: We found that baseline dACC glutamate levels in FEP were not significantly different than those of HCs. Examining Glu levels in FEP revealed a decrease in Glu levels after 16 weeks of antipsychotic treatment; this effect was weaker in HC. Finally, baseline Glu levels were associated with decreases in positive symptomology. CONCLUSIONS: We report a progressive decrease of Glu levels over a period of 16 weeks after initiation of treatment and a baseline Glu level association with a reduction in positive symptomology, suggestive of a potential mechanism of antipsychotic drug (APD) action. Overall, these findings suggest that APDs can influence Glu within a period of 16 weeks, which has been deemed as an optimal window for symptom alleviation using APDs.",

This study investigates the acute effects of three fatty acids (FAs)-lauric acid (LA), palmitic acid (PA), and oleic acid (OA)-on glutamate (GLU)-related gene expression in the HIP of male and female young mice. Hippocampal slices were treated with FAs, and mRNA levels of genes involved in GLU transport, GLU-glutamine (GLN) cycling, and GLU receptor subunit encoding were quantified using RT-PCR. FA treatment reduced mRNA levels of enzymes involved in the conversion of GLU to GLN (glutamine synthetase; GS), GABA (glutamate decarboxylase 1; GAD67), and α-ketoglutarate (glutamate pyruvate transaminase 2; AAT2). Additionally, the expression of glutamine transporters (SNAT1, SNAT2, SNAT3), the astrocytic GLU transporter GLT-1, and the NMDA receptor subunit NMDA2a was also reduced. These effects were most pronounced with LA. Notably, while the HIP showed similar sensitivity to fatty acids across sexes, overall gene expression levels were lower in females. These findings highlight the acute susceptibility of hippocampal GLU-related pathways to FA exposure, particularly LA, suggesting potential risks of high-LA diets on cognitive function. Further research is needed to explore the long-term consequences of dietary fat on hippocampal health and its sex-specific effects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Klebsiella pneumoniae, a gram-negative bacterium in the Enterobacteriaceae family, is non-motile, encapsulated, and a major cause of nosocomial infections, particularly in intensive care units. The bacterium possesses a thick polysaccharide capsule and fimbriae, which contribute to its virulence, resistance to phagocytosis, and attachment to host cells. The bacterium has developed serious resistance to most antibiotics currently in use. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the structural properties of MurI (glutamate racemase) from Klebsiella pneumoniae and to identify potential candidate inhibitors against the protein, which will help in the development of new strategies to combat the infections related to MDR strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae. METHODS: The 3D structure of the protein was modelled using SWISS-MODEL, which utilizes the homology modelling technique. After refinement, the structure was subjected to virtual high throughput screening on the TACC server using Enamine AC collection. The obtained molecules were then put through various screening parameters to obtain promising lead candidates, and the selected molecules were then subjected to MD simulations. The data obtained from MD simulations was then assessed with the help of different global dynamics analyses. The protein-ligand complexes were also subjected to MM/PBSA-based binding free energy calculation using the g_mmpbsa program. RESULTS: The screening parameters employed on the molecules obtained via virtual screening from the TACC server revealed that Z1542321346 and Z2356864560 out of four molecules have better potential to act as potential inhibitors for MurI protein. The binding free energy values, which came out to be -27.26±3.06 kcal/mol and -29.53±4.29 kcal/mol for Z1542321346 and Z2356864560 molecules, respectively, favoured these molecules in terms of inhibition potential towards targeted protein. CONCLUSION: The investigation of MurI via computational approach and the subsequent analysis of potential inhibitors can pave the way for developing new therapeutic strategies to combat the infections and antibiotic resistance of Klebsiella pneumoniae. This study could significantly help the medical fraternity in the treatment of infections caused by this multidrug-resistant pathogen.",

The aim of this study was to further explore the potential role of astrocytes in the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on neuropathic pain by focusing on the glutamate-glutamine cycle. METHODS: 69 male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into a normal control group, untreated chronic constriction injury (CCI) model group and EA-treated model (CCI + EA) group. EA was applied bilaterally at ST36 and GB34. Pain thresholds were assessed using behavioral tests and thermal stimuli. We examined the co-expression of glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST) via immunofluorescence and measured the expression levels of GLAST, glutamate transporter (GLT)-1 and glutamine synthetase (GS) using Western blotting and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To validate the impact of GLAST/GLT-1 in the analgesic effect of EA, an additional 30 SD male rats were divided into groups receiving intrathecal saline, GLAST antagonist or GLT-1 antagonist alongside EA. RESULTS: Post-CCI, pain thresholds were decreased, GLAST expression was diminished, and spinal Glu levels were increased. EA treatment reversed these effects, improved pain thresholds and GLAST/GLT-1 expression in astrocytes, and reduced Glu levels. Antagonist administration negated the analgesic effects of EA. CONCLUSION: Repeated EA administration inhibited CCI-induced chronic neuropathic pain in rats, corresponding to a reversal of decreased expression of GLAST and GLT-1, which may have accelerated the clearance of Glu and thereby reduced its concentration. Regulation of the astroglial glutamate-glutamine cycle is a potential target of EA.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is one of the most severe and chronic psychiatric disorders. Over the years, numerous treatment options have been introduced for schizophrenia. Although they are relatively successful in managing the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, most of the current treatments have a negligible effect on the negative and cognitive symptoms. Thus, none of them could prevent the relapse of psychotic episodes. Among the numerous hypotheses explaining the development and progression of schizophrenia, the cytokine hypothesis explains the role of inflammatory markers as a significant culprit in the development of schizophrenia. Elevated cytokines are reported in animal models and schizophrenic patients. The cytokine hypothesis is based on how increased inflammatory markers can cause changes in the dopaminergic, glutamate, and tryptophan metabolism pathways, like that observed in schizophrenic patients. Reasons, such as autoimmune disease, maternal immune activation, infection, etc., can pave the way for the development of schizophrenia and are associated with the negative, positive and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. Thus, there is a need to focus on the significance of anti-inflammatory drugs against these symptoms. The development of new treatment strategies in the management of schizophrenia can provide better therapeutic outcomes in terms of the severity of symptoms and treatment of drug-resistant schizophrenia. This review attempts to explain the association between elevated inflammatory markers and various neurotransmitters, and the possible use of medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, monoclonal antibodies, statins, and estrogens as adjuvant therapy. Over the years, these hypotheses have been the basis for drug discovery for the treatment of schizophrenia.",

This study examined the neurotoxic effect of monosodium glutamate (MSG) in the brain cortex of rats and focused on assessing the potential neuroprotective effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs). Four groups of adult male rats (n = 10) were assigned as follows; normal control, ω-3 PUFAs (400 mg/kg) alone, MSG (4 mg/g) alone, and MSG plus ω-3 PUFAs (4 mg/g MSG plus 400 mg/kg ω-3 PUFAs). Biochemical analysis, immunohistochemical, and histological examinations were conducted upon completion of the treatment protocol. Results revealed that MSG significantly increased malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin 1β, acetylcholinesterase, monoamine oxidase, and caspase-3. However, the MSG-treated group showed a decline in reduced glutathione, catalase, superoxide dismutase, dopamine, and serotonin. In addition, MSG caused histopathological changes in the cortical region which support the biochemical and immunohistochemical analysis. Supplementation of ω-3 PUFAs greatly improved the biochemical, immunohistochemical, and histopathological alterations induced by MSG administration in the brain cortex. Together, these findings revealed a neuroprotective effect of ω-3 PUFAs against MSG-induced toxicity in the brain cortex by attenuating oxidative damage, inflammation, neurochemical perturbations, and apoptosis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Cocaine use disorder is an intersecting issue in populations with HIV-1, further exacerbating the clinical course of the disease and contributing to neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation. Cocaine and HIV neurotoxins play roles in neuronal damage during neuroHIV progression by disrupting glutamate homeostasis in the brain. Even with combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), HIV-1 Nef, an early viral protein expressed in approximately 1% of infected astrocytes, remains a key neurotoxin. This study investigates the relationship among Nef, glutamate homeostasis, and cocaine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a critical brain region associated with drug motivation and reward. METHODS: Male and female Sprague Dawley rats were used to compare the effects of astrocytic Nef and cocaine by molecular analysis of glutamate transporters, GLT-1 and the cysteine glutamate exchanger (xCT), in the NAc. Behavioral assessments for cocaine self-administration were used to evaluate cocaine-seeking behavior. RESULTS: The findings indicate that both cocaine and Nef independently decrease the expression of the glutamate transporter GLT-1 in the NAc. Additionally, rats with astrocytic Nef expression exhibited increased cocaine-seeking behavior but demonstrated sex-dependent molecular differences after the behavioral paradigm. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the expression of Nef intensifies cocaine-induced alterations in glutamate homeostasis in the NAc, potentially underlying increased cocaine-seeking behavior. Understanding these interactions better may inform therapeutic strategies for managing cocaine use disorder in HIV-infected individuals."

      "abstract": "Provoked vulvodynia (PV) is the leading cause of vulvar pain and dyspareunia. The etiology of PV is multifactorial and remains poorly understood. PV is associated with a history of repeated vulvar inflammation and is often accompanied by sensory neuromodulation as a result of activation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) in the sensory nerve terminals. Therefore, this study aims to examine the role of glutamate-mGluR5 signaling during the initial inflammatory phase in chronic vulvar pain development in an animal model of PV.Thermal and mechanical vulvar sensitivity was assessed for three weeks following zymosan vulvar challenges. Anxiety-like behavior and locomotor activity were assessed at the end of the experiment. To investigate the role of glutamate mGluR5, the MTEP (mGluR5 antagonist) was injected into the vulva during vulvar inflammation. On the other hand, glutamate or CHPG (mGluR5 agonist) were injected in order to examine the effects of mGluR5 activation. RT-PCR was performed to assess changes in the transcription of genes related to neuroinflammation, neuromodulation, and neuroplasticity in the spinal cord (L6-S3). Zymosan-induced inflammation resulted in a significant thermal and mechanical vulvar hypersensitivity that persisted for over a month after the zymosan injection. However, local treatment with MTEP enhanced the vulvar mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity. On the other hand, activation of the mGluR5 via injection of glutamate or CHPG into the vulva leads to long-lasting vulvar mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity. The activation of the glutamate pathway was found to be accompanied by an increase in the transcription level of genes related to neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity in the sacral spine region. The present findings indicate that vulvar hypersensitivity is mediated by mGluR5 activation during inflammation. Hence, modulation of the mGluR5 pathway during the critical period of inflammation contributes to preventing chronic vulvar pain development. Conversely, activation of the mGluR5 pathway leads to long-lasting mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity.",

      "abstract": "The dysfunction of mitochondria, the primary source of cellular energy and producer of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is associated with brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Scientific evidence indicates that light in the visible and near-infrared spectrum can modulate mitochondrial activity, a phenomenon known in medicine as photobiomodulation therapy (PBM-t). The beneficial effects of PBM-t on dementia and neurodegeneration have been reviewed in the literature. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these findings have yet to be fully elucidated. This study investigates the mechanism behind dose-dependent glutamate release in nerve terminals after irradiation with 810 nm, 1 W for 60 s continuous, 1 cm2, 1 W/cm2, 60 J, 60 J/cm2 (810 nm-1 W) or 810 nm, 0.1 W for 60 s continuous, 1 cm2, 0.1 W/cm2, 6 J, 6 J/cm2 (810 nm-0.1 W), focusing on mitochondrial activities. The results show that PBM modulated the mitochondrial metabolism of cortical nerve terminals and supported a power-dependent increase in oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) activity when stimulated with pyruvate plus malate (P/M) or succinate (succ) as respiratory substrates. The PBM-induced increase in OxPhos was sensitive to adding rotenone (Complex I inhibitor) and antimycin A (Complex III inhibitor) when synaptosomes were stimulated with P/M, but only to antimycin A when stimulated with succ. This allowed us to observe that the glutamate efflux, disrupted in the presence of rotenone, was partially restored by PBM due to the increase in the OxPhos pathway led by Complex II. This evidence suggests that PBM, acting on mitochondria, could facilitate physiological communication within the neuron-astrocyte network through vesicular glutamate release, potentially regulating healthy brain function and brain dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "The astroglial glutamate transporter in the hippocampus and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is critically involved in chronic pain-induced cognitive and psychiatric abnormalities. We have previously reported that LDN-212320, a glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) activator, attenuates complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced acute and chronic nociceptive pain. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying GLT-1 modulation in the hippocampus and ACC during chronic pain-induced cognitive deficit-like and anxiety-like behaviors remain unknown. Here, we have investigated the effects of LDN-212320 on CFA-induced chronic pain associated with cognitive deficit-like and anxiety-like behaviors in mice. We have evaluated the effects of LDN-212320 on CFA-induced impaired spatial, working, and recognition memory using Y-maze and object-place recognition tests. In addition, we have determined the effects of LDN-21230 on chronic pain-induced anxiety-like behaviors using elevated plus maze and marble burying test. We have also examined the effects of LDN-212320 on cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), protein kinase A (PKA), and Ca2 +/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) expression in the hippocampus and ACC during CFA-induced cognitive deficit-like and anxiety-like behaviors using the Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence assay. Pretreatment with LDN-212320 (20 mg/kg) significantly attenuated CFA-induced impaired spatial, working, and recognition memory. Furthermore, LDN-212320 (20 mg/kg) significantly reduced CFA-induced anxiety-like behaviors. Additionally, LDN-212320 (20 mg/kg) significantly reversed CFA-induced decreased pCREB, BDNF, PKA and CaMKII expression in the hippocampus and ACC. Overall, these results suggest that the LDN-212320 prevents CFA-induced cognitive deficit-like and anxiety-like behaviors by activating CaMKII/CREB/BDNF signaling pathway in the hippocampus and ACC. Therefore, LDN-212320 could be a potential treatment for chronic pain associated with cognitive impairment and anxiety-like behaviors.",

Although cases of neuropsychiatric symptoms developing after treatment with ciprofloxacin have been reported in the literature, the number of reports of manic episodes after ciprofloxacin use is limited, and there have been no reports of delirious mania developing after ciprofloxacin use until the case presented in this report. Here we report the case of a 52-year-old woman who developed manic symptoms after receiving ciprofloxacin, which evolved into delirious mania.

      "abstract": "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a type of malignancy characterized by harboring the oncogene Bcr-Abl, which encodes the constitutively activated tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL. Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting BCR-ABL have revolutionized CML therapy, native and acquired drug resistance commonly remains a great challenge. Thioredoxin 1 (Trx1) and glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL), which are two major antioxidants that maintain cellular redox homeostasis, are potential targets for cancer therapy and overcoming drug resistance. However, how their inhibition is implicated in CML is still unclear. Here, our results revealed that Trx1 was overexpressed in patients with CML compared with healthy donors. Trx1 expression was greater in imatinib-resistant CML cells than in imatinib-sensitive cells. Pharmacological inhibitors of Trx1 attenuated cell growth and reduced colony formation in both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant CML cells. Furthermore, decreased Trx1 expression enhanced the cytotoxicity of the GCL inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine (BSO). We surmise that the combined inhibition of Trx1 and GCL promotes the induction of hydrogen peroxide and depletes GPX4 expression in CML cells, resulting in ferroptosis in cancerous cells. Finally, the combined inhibition of Trx1 and GCL had a synergistic effect on CML cells in murine xenograft models. These findings offer crucial informationregarding the combined roles ofTrx1 and GCL in triggering ferroptosis in CML and suggestefficacioustherapeutic uses for these systems in this disease.",

      "abstract": "Monosodium glutamate (MSG), a widely used food additive, has been associated with various health concerns, including potential reproductive toxicity. This study investigated the protective effects of black garlic (BG) ethanol extract against MSG-induced ovarian damage in rats. Thirty-two female rats in estrus were randomly divided into four groups (n = 8 per group): control (saline), BG (250 mg/kg BW), MSG (4 mg/g BW), and BG+MSG (combined treatment). Treatments were administered daily for 14 days. Ovarian tissues were collected for histopathological, immunohistochemical (IHC), and biochemical analyses. Histopathological examination revealed a significant reduction in cystic follicles in the BG+MSG group compared to the MSG group (p < 0.0001). IHC analysis showed decreased immunoreactivity of endothelin-1 and endothelin-2 in the BG+MSG group compared to the MSG group (both p < 0.01). Biochemical assays demonstrated significantly increased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and estradiol levels in the BG+MSG group compared to the MSG group (all p < 0.05), while progesterone levels were significantly lower in the MSG group compared to the BG+MSG group (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that BG ethanol extract may mitigate MSG-induced ovarian dysfunction in rats by alleviating degenerative changes in follicles and modulating hormonal levels. This study provides insights into potential natural interventions for MSG-related reproductive toxicity."

      "abstract": "Neurological disorders significantly impact the central nervous system, contributing to a growing public health crisis globally. The spectrum of these disorders includes neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. This manuscript reviews the crucial roles of cellular signalling pathways in the pathophysiology of these conditions, focusing primarily on glutaminase/glutamate/NMDA receptor signalling, alongside the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways-ERK1/2, C-JNK, and P38 MAPK. Activation of these pathways is often correlated with neuronal excitotoxicity, apoptosis, and inflammation, leading to many other pathological conditions such as traumatic brain injury, stroke, and brain tumor. The interplay between glutamate overstimulation and MAPK signalling exacerbates neurodegenerative processes, underscoring the complexity of cellular communication in maintaining neuronal health. Dysfunctional signalling alters synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival, contributing to cognitive impairments in various neurological diseases. The manuscript emphasizes the potential of targeting these signalling pathways for therapeutic interventions, promoting neuroprotection and reducing neuroinflammation. Incorporating insights from precision medicine and innovative drug delivery systems could enhance treatment efficacy. Overall, understanding the intricate mechanisms of these pathways is essential for developing effective strategies to mitigate the impact of neurological disorders and improve patient outcomes. This review highlights the necessity for further exploration into these signalling cascades to facilitate advancements in therapeutic approaches, ensuring better prognoses for individuals affected by neurological conditions.",

N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG) has been extensively studied in neurological disorders; however, its potential role in restricting anti-tumor immunity has not been investigated. Here, we demonstrated that NAAG or its synthetase RimK-like family member B (RIMKLB) significantly disrupted anti-tumor immunity by rewiring the myeloid progenitor differentiation of polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs), which in turn promoted breast cancer growth and metastasis. Mechanistically, NAAG sustained the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment by activating an NR2B-containing NMDA receptor (NR2B-NMDAR)-dependent p38-NOTCH1 axis, and subsequently stimulating tumor cell migration and invasion, as well as inducing PMN-MDSC differentiation and expansion. In mouse models, RIMKLB ablation or NMDAR inhibition enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy and suppressed tumor progression. An analysis of clinical samples revealed that high levels of NAAG and NR2B-NMDAR predicted a poor prognosis in TNBC patients. Collectively, our findings have uncovered a signaling role for tumor-derived NAAG beyond its classic function as a neurotransmitter that can be targeted pharmacologically to enhance immunotherapy against breast cancer.",

FABP5 expression was significantly upregulated in the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) model, the microbead-induced chronic glaucoma model, and the DBA/2J mice. Previous studies have demonstrated that FABP5 can mediate mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in ischemic neurons, but the role of FABP5 in oxidative stress and cell death in retina NMDA injury models is unclear. In this study, we found that FABP5 is significantly altered in a model of glutamate excitotoxicity and is regulated by Stat3. Inhibition of FABP5 alleviated oxidative stress imbalance and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, reduced the release of inflammatory factors, and ultimately attenuated glutamate excitotoxicity-induced retinal ganglion cell loss. Meanwhile, caspase1 inhibitors could alleviate the retinal ganglion cell loss induced by glutamate excitotoxicity. In conclusion, FABP5 inhibition protects retina ganglion cells from excitotoxic damage by suppressing the ROS-NLRP3 inflammasome pathway.

      "abstract": "Cisplatin, a chemotherapeutic drug, is known for causing gastrointestinal disorders and neuropathic pain, but its impact on visceral sensitivity is unclear. Monosodium glutamate (MSG) has been shown to improve gastrointestinal dysmotility and neuropathic pain induced by cisplatin in rats. This study aimed to determine if repeated cisplatin treatment alters visceral sensitivity and whether dietary MSG can prevent these changes. Male Wistar HAN rats were treated with saline or cisplatin (2 mg/kg/week, ip) for 5 weeks, and visceral sensitivity to intracolonic mechanical stimulation was recorded after the final cisplatin administration (week 5) and one-week post-treatment (week 6). In a second cohort, rats treated with cisplatin or saline also received MSG (4 g/L) in their drinking water, and visceral sensitivity was evaluated on week 6. Finally, the untouched distal colon was obtained from a third cohort of animals one week after treatment to assess immunocyte infiltration. Cisplatin significantly increased colonic mechanical sensitivity on week 6 but not on week 5. MSG did not prevent cisplatin-induced visceral hypersensitivity on week 6 and even exacerbated it. On week 6, compared with the control, cisplatin (with or without MSG) did not modify the colonic infiltration of eosinophils, macrophages, neutrophils, or mast cells. Although MSG seems to be useful in ameliorating some of the adverse effects of cisplatin, such as gastrointestinal motility disturbances or neuropathic pain, it does not alleviate visceral pain.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Background Monosodium glutamate (MSG) in its anionic form, glutamate, is one of the main excitatory amino acids. Excess of this neurotransmitter may lead to excitotoxicity affecting neurons and astrocytes responsible for glutamate metabolism in different brain areas of animals. The aim of the study was to investigate the immunoreactivity of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and S100β protein in the caudate nucleus of rats under the condition of elevated glutamate levels. METHODS: Fifteen rats were divided into a control group receiving saline and MSG2 and MSG4 groups receiving 2 g/kg b.w. MSG and 4 g/kg b.w. MSG, respectively, for 3 days. An immunohistochemical reaction was conducted on frontal sections containing the caudate nucleus with use of antibodies against GFAP and S100β. RESULTS: Analyses indicated elevated density of astrocytes immunoreactive for the studied proteins in the caudate nucleus in animals receiving MSG. The studied glial cells also demonstrated increased immunostaining intensity for both GFAP and S100β immunoreactive cells especially in the MSG4 group. The number of GFAP-positive processes in astrocytes was similar in all studied groups. CONCLUSIONS: The studies demonstrate a potential response of astrocytes to the effect of MSG administration in the caudate nucleus. It was shown that GFAP- and S100β-positive astrocytes in the caudate nucleus may act differently, suggesting distinct roles of these proteins against glutamate excitotoxicity."

      "abstract": "Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors are candidate drug targets for therapeutic intervention in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here we focused on mGlu3, a receptor subtype involved in synaptic regulation and neuroinflammation. mGlu3-/- mice showed an enhanced nigro-striatal damage and microglial activation in response to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Expression of genes encoding anti-inflammatory proteins and neuroprotective factors was reduced in the striatum of MPTP-treated mGlu3-/- mice. We also examined polymorphic variants of GRM3 (the mGlu3 receptor encoding gene) in 723 PD patients and 826 healthy controls. Two GRM3 haplotypes were associated with PD, and gene variants correlated with motor and non-motor signs. Interestingly, PD patients carrying each of the two haplotypes showed an impaired cortical plasticity in the paired associated stimulation paradigm of magnetic transcranial stimulation. These findings suggest that mGlu3 receptors are neuroprotective in mouse models of parkinsonism and shape mechanisms of cortical plasticity in PD."

      "abstract": "Epilepsy (EP) is a neurological disorder characterized by abnormal, sudden neuronal discharges. Seizures increase extracellular glutamate levels, causing excitotoxic damage. Glutamate transporter type 1 (GLT-1) and its human homologue excitatory amino acid transporter-2 (EAAT2) clear 95% of extracellular glutamate. Studies on neurodegenerative diseases suggest that trichostatin A (TSA), a broad-spectrum histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, can increase GLT-1/EAAT2 transcription. However, the precise mechanism by which TSA modulates GLT-1/EAAT2 levels remains unclear. This research demonstrated that TSA increases GLT-1/EAAT2 expression through histone acetylation, exerting substantial antiepileptic effects. Our results identify a promising therapeutic strategy for EP involving the modulation of glutamate transporters to mitigate seizures. Future research should explore the specific mechanisms underlying the effects of TSA and its potential clinical applications. Acute and chronic EP models were induced using kainic acid (KA) to assess the effects of TSA on the seizure threshold and frequency. Electrophysiological recordings of the hippocampus were used to evaluate the impact of TSA on neuronal excitability. RNA-Seq was used to analyse changes in glutamate transporter-related gene expression. Western blot analysis and qRT‒PCR were used to assess the influence of TSA on HDAC expression. To validate the role of GLT-1/EAAT2 in the antiepileptic effects of TSA, the impact of the GLT-1/EAAT2 inhibitor dihydrokainic acid (DHK) on the effects of TSA was assessed. Glutamate release was measured, and microdialysis was used to determine the glutamate content in the cerebrospinal fluid. Finally, metabolomics analysis was used to explore changes in amino acid levels in the hippocampus following TSA treatment to further confirm the antiepileptic potential of TSA. TSA effectively inhibited seizures in both acute and chronic models. It reduced the amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic currents (PSCs) and the frequency of spontaneous excitatory PSCs in the hippocampus without affecting inhibitory PSCs. Transcriptome analysis was used to identify glutamate transmission-related targets and revealed significant upregulation of the GLT-1 and EAAT2 genes in the hippocampus, which was confirmed by qRT‒PCR and Western blotting. Acetylation-induced upregulation of GLT-1/EAAT2 was observed, and inhibition of these transporters by DHK reduced the seizure-mitigating effects of TSA, underscoring the role of GLT-1/EAAT2 in clearing glutamate and its contribution to the observed antiepileptic effects of TSA. Our findings highlight the crucial role of GLT-1/EAAT2 in mediating the impact of TSA on glutamatergic transmission and seizure activity. These insights pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for EP involving the modulation of glutamate transporters.",

It has been implicated in neurotoxicity observed in children with sulfite oxidase deficiency. The aim of our study was to confirm the neurotoxic effects of SSC using a mouse hippocampal cell line (HT-22) and to investigate the role of apoptosis in these effects, especially in terms of caspase-3 activation and genotoxicity. Based on the viability graph obtained following increasing concentrations of SSC, we determined the LC50 dose of SSC to be 125 µM by probit analysis. The cytotoxic effects of SSC were not reversed by glutamate receptor blocker administration. However, SSC treatment did not induce caspase-3 activation or induce DNA damage. Our results showed that SSC has a cytotoxic effect on neurons like glutamate, but glutamate receptor blockers reversed glutamate-induced toxicity, while these blockers did not protect neurons from SSC toxicity. The absence of caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation, which are indicative of apoptosis, in SSC-induced cell death suggests that alternative cell death pathways, such as necrosis and oxytosis may be implicated. Further research is necessary to fully elucidate SSC-induced cell death. The aim of our study was to confirm the neurotoxic effects of SSC using a mouse hippocampal cell line (HT-22) and to investigate the role of apoptosis in these effects, especially in terms of caspase-3 activation and genotoxicity."

However, current medications for ADHD have limitations and potential adverse effects. Glutamate, a neurotransmitter that directly and indirectly modulates dopamine neurotransmission, is considered a new therapeutic target for ADHD. We conducted a systematic review to determine the efficacy and safety of memantine, an uncompetitive N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, in both pediatric and adult patients with ADHD. Data Sources: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library for articles on memantine use in ADHD patients published up to August 31, 2023, using terms related to ADHD and memantine. Study Selection: Studies selected according to PRISMA guidelines. We included both randomized and nonrandomized trials for a comprehensive review. We excluded non-English publications, review articles, and studies without full text. Data Extraction: Two authors extracted data using the data extraction form designed for this review. Independent authors conducted a risk of bias assessment using risk of bias 2 (RoB 2) and Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I). Results: Six studies met the inclusion criteria, 3 on pediatric populations, and 3 on adults. Three studies were conducted in the United States (2 in adults) and 3 in Iran (1 in adults). Memantine showed potential benefits in managing ADHD symptoms and had a favorable safety profile. However, most studies involved small patient groups at single institutions, and their quality was low. Conclusions: Memantine has the potential to be a relatively safe alternative or adjunctive treatment for ADHD, but more refined studies with larger populations are needed.

This study was designed to determine if patients with chronic schizophrenia inadequately responding to a second-generation antipsychotic would benefit from add-on treatment with evenamide at a dose of 30 mg bid. METHODS: Study 008A was a prospective, 4-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of oral doses of evenamide of 30 mg bid in patients with chronic schizophrenia treated at stable therapeutic doses of a second-generation antipsychotic. Outpatients aged ≥18 years, both males and females, with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (DSM-V), who had been receiving antipsychotics for at least 2 years at stable doses, but still symptomatic (PANSS 70-85, CGI-S 4-6, predominant positive symptoms), were eligible for the study. Patients were randomised equally to evenamide 30 mg or placebo, given bid, after completing a 21-day screening period. The primary outcome (change from baseline in PANSS total score) was assessed weekly, with the primary endpoint at 4 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 291 patients were enrolled, of which 11 (3·8%) discontinued prematurely, overall. Add-on treatment with evenamide was associated to a statistically significant (the absolute difference of the two treatment groups for the PANSS Total at Day 29, primary efficacy endpoint, was = 2·5 [p-value<0.05] that is associated with a Cohen's d effect size = 0·33) and clinically meaningful benefit compared to placebo across all efficacy measures, and was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: The demonstration of statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit of evenamide, a glutamate modulator, as add-on treatment in patients with chronic schizophrenia inadequately responding to their second-generation antipsychotic may represent a new treatment paradigm for this population.",

However, its treatment solution is rich in crude protein, which has the potential to be developed as a new protein source for animal feed. METHODS AND RESULTS: Given that the fermentation process generates functionally different metabolites, this study innovatively utilized two strains of feed microorganisms, Aspergillus niger and Candida tropicalis, to perform solid-state fermentation of glutamate wastewater treatment solution. The aim was to investigate and analyse the metabolite profiles during fermentation. The significant differences in metabolite profiles between the samples were determined using correlation analysis, principal component analysis, orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis, variable importance in projection analysis, Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genomes, and Human Metabolome Data Bank analysis. These variations were mainly manifested in essential feed components, such as amino acids, peptides, and their analogues. These included Ile-Pro-Asn, Pro-Gly-Val, alanylvaline, histidylisoleucine, Lys-Leu-Tyr, Ile-Arg, glycyl-leucine, leucyl-lysine, N-palmitoyl histidine, alanylisoleucine, l-glutamate, N-methylisoleucine, Isoleucylproline, dl-m-tyrosine, Isoleucyl-threonine, phenylalanine amide, carboxyethyllysine, N6-acetyl-l-lysine, citrulline, N-alpha-acetyl-l-lysine, N(6)-methyllysine, and l-aspartate-semialdehyde.

The scaffolds containing microfibrillated cellulose, chitosan, polycaprolactone, zirconium, and hydroxyapatite were fabricated by the freeze-drying method. Conventional methods, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis, were used to evaluate morphological and physicochemical properties of composite scaffolds. The fabricated scaffolds (S1-S7) had spongy properties that all functional groups were present in the sponge. Biological properties for cell survival were evaluated by the MTT assay, ALP, and ARS activities, respectively. In physicochemical studies, scaffolds showed tunable water absorption, swelling studies, degradation, sustained drug release, and mechanical properties. In biological studies, the cell proliferation and attachment were shown to significantly increase in scaffolds on MG63 cells. After 7 days of cell culture, ALP and ARS activity indicated the enhancement of extracellular calcium deposition of the MG63 cells on the treated scaffolds. In summary, the scaffolds S7 (C/H/MFC/Zr) treated with dimethyl glutamate revealed favorable effects on bone tissues, implying a potential towards the treatment of bone defects and drug delivery.",

Nevertheless, alterations in the glutamatergic signaling pathway are now accepted as a central element in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology. One of the most prevalent types of dementia in older adults is AD, a progressive neurodegenerative illness brought on by a persistent decline in cognitive function. Since AD has been shown to be multifactorial, a variety of pharmaceutical targets may be used to treat the condition. N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) antagonists and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) are two drug classes that the Food and Drug Administration has authorized for the treatment of AD. The AChEIs approved to treat AD are galantamine, donepezil, and rivastigmine. However, memantine is the only non-competitive NMDAR antagonist that has been authorized for the treatment of AD. This review aims to outline the involvement of glutamate (GLU) at the molecular level and the signaling pathways that are associated with AD to demonstrate the drug target therapeutic potential of glutamate and its receptor. We will also consider the opinion of the leading authorities working in this area, the drawback of the existing therapeutic strategies, and the direction for the further investigation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The study demonstrates that pharmacological blockade of type 3 metabotropic glutamate (mGlu3) receptors at the time of tumor induction significantly reduces the incidence of brain gliomas in rats. The overall survival of patients with high-grade brain gliomas is 14-20 months after current multimodal therapy, including surgery, radiotherapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate in this experimental model that pharmacological blockade of group II metabotropic glutamate receptors reduces the incidence of brain tumors induced by prenatal exposure to N- ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) in rats. METHODS: Dams received a single injection of ENU (40 mg/kg, e.v.) at day 20 of pregnancy, combined with 5 daily injections of either saline or the mGlu2/3 receptor antagonist, LY341495 (10 mg/kg) (from day 15 to day 21 of pregnancy). Assessment of brain tumors in the offspring at 5 months of age showed the presence of mixed gliomas (astrocytomas/oligodendrogliomas) in 70% of the ENU + saline group of rats and only in 30% of the ENU + LY341495 group. CONCLUSION: Tumors in both groups of rats showed a moderate/high expression of the astrocyte marker, GFAP, and the oligodendrocyte marker, OLIG-2, and a low expression of the proliferation marker, Ki-67. However, tumors of the ENU + LY341495 group showed a reduced density of Iba-1+ cells, suggesting a lower extent of neuroinflammation in the tumor microenvironment. These findings strengthen the hypothesis that mGlu3 receptors are candidate drug targets for the treatment of malignant gliomas."

      "abstract": "Comorbid anxiety in chronic pain is clinically common, with a comorbidity rate of over 50%. The main treatments are based on pharmacological, interventional, and implantable approaches, which have limited efficacy and carry a risk of side effects. Here, we report a terahertz (THz, 1012 Hz) wave stimulation (THS) technique, which exerts nonthermal, long-term modulatory effects on neuronal activity by reducing the binding between nano-sized glutamate molecules and GluA2, leading to the relief of pain and comorbid anxiety-like behaviors in mice. In mice with co-occurring anxiety and chronic pain induced by complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) injection, hyperactivity was observed in glutamatergic neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACCGlu). Using whole-cell recording in ACC slices, we demonstrated that THS (34 THz) effectively inhibited the excitability of ACCGlu. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations showed that THS reduced the number of hydrogen bonds bound between glutamate molecules and GluA2. Furthermore, THS target to the ACC in CFA-treatment mice suppressed ACCGlu hyperactivity and, as a result, alleviated pain and anxiety-like behaviors. Consistently, inhibition of ACCGlu hyperactivity by chemogenetics mimics THS-induced antinociceptive and antianxiety behavior. Together, our study provides evidence for THS as an intervention technique for modulating neuronal activity and a viable clinical treatment strategy for pain and comorbid anxiety."

      "abstract": "Activation of dermal mast cells through the Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor B2 receptor (MrgprB2 in mice and MrgprX2 in humans) is a key component of numerous inflammatory skin diseases, including dermatitis and rosacea. Sensory neurons actively suppress mast cell activation through the regulated release of glutamate, resulting in reduced expression of Mrgprb2 as well as genes associated with proteins found in mast cell granules. To determine whether exogenous glutamate receptor agonism could suppress mast cell function, we determined that mast cells have relatively selective expression of the glutamate receptor ionotropic, kainate 2 (GluK2). A GluK2-specific agonist, SYM2081, effectively inhibited mast cell degranulation in response to MrgprB2 agonism in both murine mast cells and human skin explants in vitro as well as in vivo after both intradermal and topical administration of SYM2081 to mice. Analyses of transcriptomic datasets from SYM2081-treated mast cells using standard differential expression approaches and an interpretable machine learning technique revealed a previously unrecognized cellular program coordinately regulated by GluK2 agonism. GluK2 agonism suppressed the expression of Mrgprb2 and genes associated with mast cell proliferation. Suppression of mast cell proliferation by SYM2081 exposure was confirmed on the basis of reduced Ki-67 expression and BrdU incorporation in vitro and in vivo. Last, pretreatment with SYM2081 reduced skin inflammation in murine models of dermatitis and rosacea. Thus, agonism of GluK2 represents a promising approach to suppress mast cell activation and may prove beneficial as therapy for inflammatory diseases in which mast cell activation is pathogenic.",

      "abstract": "Neurotransmitter transporters (NTTs) control synaptic responses by modulating the concentration of neurotransmitters at the synaptic cleft. Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and needs to be finely tuned in time and space to maintain a healthy brain and precise neurotransmission. The glutamate transporter EAAT2 (SLC1A2) is primarily responsible for glutamate clearance. EAAT2 impairment has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) contribute to both monogenic and sporadic forms of PD, of which the common substitution Gly2019Ser is associated with a significant deficit in EAAT2 expression. The role of pathological mutants of the LRRK2 is intensively studied and reviewed. Here we have focused the attention on the physiological role of LRRK2 on EAAT2, comparing the activity of NTTs with or without the LRRK2 kinase. By heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes and two-electrode voltage clamp, the current amplitudes of the selected NTTs and kinetic parameters have been collected in the presence and absence of LRRK2. The results show that EAAT2 expression and function are impaired in the absence of the kinase and also under its pharmacological inhibition via MLi-2 treatment. LRRK2 stabilizes EAAT2 expression increasing the amount of transporter at the plasma membrane. Interestingly, the LRRK2 action is EAAT2-specific, as we observed no significant changes in the transport current amplitude and kinetic parameters obtained for the other excitatory and inhibitory NTTs studied. This study, for the first time, demonstrates the physiological importance of LRRK2 in EAAT2 function, highlighting the specificity of LRRK2-mediated modulation of EAAT2 and suggesting a potential role for the kinase as a checkpoint for preserving neurons from excitotoxicity. In brain conditions associated with impaired glutamate clearance, targeting LRRK2 for EAAT2 regulation may offer novel therapeutic opportunities.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Slow-acting biogenic amines, such as dopamine, are known to modulate fast neurotransmitters e.g. glutamate. In the striatum, dopamine (DA) interacts with glutamate, influencing neural excitability and promoting synaptic plasticity. The exact mechanism of such interaction is not fully understood. This study investigates, in detail, how dopamine overactivity in dopamine transporter knockout (DAT-/-) rats, alters the homeostasis of the striatal glutamate synapse from a molecular, behavioural and functional point of view. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The expression, localisation, retention and electrophysiological properties of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors as well as dendritic spine density and morphology were investigated in the striatum of DAT-/- rats, at baseline and after treatment with the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist memantine (30 mg kg-1). KEY RESULTS: Dopamine overactivity dramatically reorganises the striatal glutamate synapse, redistributing NMDA receptors in the synapse as typified by reduced synaptic availability and reduced expression of NMDA scaffolding proteins, as well as by increased GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors in the extra synapse. Such changes are accompanied by reduced spine density, suggesting dopamine-induced structural rearrangements. These results converge into a compromised plasticity, as shown by the impaired ability to promote long-term depression (LTD) in the striatum of DAT-/-rats. Notably, memantine counteracts hyperlocomotion, reverses spine alterations and abolishes the extrasynaptic movements of NMDA receptors in the striatum of DAT-/- rats, thus restoring functional LTD. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: A hyperdopaminergic condition seems to alter striatal homeostasis by increasing extrasynaptic NMDA receptors. These findings may be relevant to manipulate disorders characterised by elevated dopaminergic activity.",

This study explored glutamate levels in the occipital cortex (OCC) and cognitive function in ultra-treatment resistant schizophrenia (uTRS) compared to healthy controls. METHODS: Fifteen uTRS participants and 19 healthy controls underwent 3T proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) to measure glutamate levels in the OCC. Cognitive performance was assessed using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). RESULTS: No significant differences in OCC glutamate levels were found between uTRS participants and healthy controls. uTRS participants performed significantly worse on the MCCB compared to healthy controls, with a large effect size (η² = 0.72). Although no significant direct relationships were observed between Glu levels and cognitive performance, significant regression models for certain cognitive domains suggest a modest association between Glu levels and cognitive outcomes. CONCLUSION: Participants with uTRS exhibited significant cognitive deficits compared to healthy controls, though no significant differences in OCC Glu levels were found. While no clear linear or quadratic relationships emerged, Glu explained a small portion of the variance in cognitive performance, indicating a more complex role for Glu in cognition that warrants further investigation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Andrographolide is a medicinal compound which possesses anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. A number of cellular targets of andrographolide have been identified by target predictions and computational studies. PURPOSE: However, a potential cellular target of andrographolide has never been explored in SARS-CoV-2 infected lung epithelial cells. We aimed to identify cellular pathways involved in andrographolide-mediated anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. METHODS: The viral infection was determined by immunofluorescence staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and focus-forming assay. Proteomic analysis was employed to identify cellular pathways and key proteins controlled by andrographolide in the human lung epithelial cells Calu-3 infected by SARS-CoV-2. Immunofluorescence staining was used to test protein expression and localization. Western blot and realtime PCR were utilized to elucidate gene expression. Cellular glutathione level was examined by a reduced/oxidized glutathione assay. An ectopic gene expression was delivered by plasmid transfection. RESULTS: Gene ontology analysis indicates that proteins involved in nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2)-regulated pathways were differentially expressed by andrographolide. Notably, andrographolide increased expression and nuclear localization of the transcription factor NRF2. In addition, transcriptional expression of GCLC and glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM), which are NRF2 target genes, were induced by andrographolide. We further find that infection of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in a reduction of glutathione level in Calu-3; the effect that was rescued by andrographolide. Moreover, andrographolide also induced expression of the glutathione producing enzyme GCLC in SARS-CoV-2 infected lung epithelial cells. Importantly, an ectopic over-expression of GCLC or treatment of N-acetyl-L-cysteine in Calu-3 cells led to a decrease in SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our findings suggest the interplay between GCLC-mediated glutathione biogenesis induced by andrographolide and the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. The glutathione biogenesis and recycling pathways should be further exploited as a targeted therapy against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a systemic disease characterized by motor and nonmotor impairments. Loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta region in PD disrupts dopamine-glutamate homeostasis in the corticostriatal circuit, contributing to cognitive impairment. In addition, excitatory amino acid transporter-2 (EAAT2), localized predominantly to astrocytes and responsible for > 80% of synaptic glutamate clearance, is downregulated in PD, causing glutamate spillover and excitotoxicity. This altered dopamine-glutamate homeostasis and excitotoxicity may affect reward-mediated decision-making behaviors and promote impulsive behaviors in PD. In this study, we hypothesized that GTS467, a small-molecule activator of EAAT2, could effectively reduce excitotoxicity and treat cognitive impairment without promoting impulsive behavior in PD. Rats that were unilaterally lesioned with the 6-OHDA toxin to produce Parkinsonian symptoms were referred to as lesioned rats. Lesioned rats were trained to meet baseline criteria in a 5-choice serial reaction time task, and the chronic effects of GTS467 were assessed after 3 weeks of treatment. The results showed that chronic treatment with GTS467 significantly improved correct responses and reduced premature impulsive responses and omissions compared with saline treatment. This improvement in performance correlated with a reduction in glutamate levels, an increase in EAAT2 expression, and normalization of NMDA receptor subunit expression and signaling. Furthermore, transcriptomic studies on the prefrontal cortex tissue have shown the differential expression of genes involved in neuroprotection, neuroinflammation, learning, and memory. These results validate the role of glutamate excitotoxicity in promoting impulsive behaviors and suggest that GTS467 can be developed as a therapeutic agent to reduce cognitive impairment and impulsive behaviors in PD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Motor impairments are the defining cardinal features of Parkinson's disease (PD), resulting from malfunction of the cortico-basal ganglia circuit. Clinical data have demonstrated that electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation may benefit motor symptoms in PD without adverse effects. However, the specific effects of EA on PD and the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. METHODS: This study investigated the effects of EA stimulation during and after 100 Hz application in a rat model of PD created by unilateral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). To establish optimal treatment parameters of EA, motor behaviours were dynamically assessed using open field and rotarod tests. Additionally, we evaluated corticostriatal spine plasticity using immunoelectron microscopy and measured the levels of dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmitters through microdialysis, in vivo electrochemistry and high-performance liquid chromatography. Neural activity dynamics were recorded by measuring local field potentials in both the motor cortex and the striatum. Furthermore, chemogenetic techniques were employed to manipulate corticostriatal glutamatergic neurons and clarify the mechanisms that contribute to the therapeutic benefits of EA in the PD rat model. RESULTS: Chronic EA stimulation resulted in a gradual and long-lasting alleviation of motor symptoms, independent of nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) restoration. Notably, EA stimulation modulated corticostriatal spine plasticity and reduced excessive glutamate transmission in PD model rats. Moreover, EA effectively inhibited aberrant corticostriatal synchronised high-beta (25-40 Hz) oscillations, which serves as a pathological biomarker of PD. Conversely, chronic chemogenetic activation of corticostriatal glutamatergic neurons hindered these positive outcomes of EA treatment in PD model rats. CONCLUSIONS: This study sheds light on the temporal dynamics and optimal parameters of EA treatment in PD. It emphasises the significance of inhibiting corticostriatal glutamate transmission in EA's therapeutic benefits for PD. Targeting glutamatergic neurons with EA holds promise as a non-dopaminergic intervention for managing motor symptoms and abnormal neural activity with PD. KEY POINTS: EA commonly protects dopaminergic neuronsby reducing neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. New findings reveal that EA alleviates motor symptoms in a parkinsonian rat model without restoring striatal dopamine levels. EA effectively suppresses excessiveglutamate transmission and high-beta synchronization, contributing to motorsymptom relief. Activation of corticostriatalglutamatergic projections may hinder the efficacy of EA.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Bariatric surgery effectively treats non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The glutamate-serine-glycine (GSG) index has emerged as a non-invasive diagnostic marker for NAFLD, but its ability to monitor treatment response remains unclear. This study investigates the GSG index's ability to monitor NAFLD's response to bariatric surgery. METHODOLOGY: Ten NAFLD participants were studied at baseline and 6 months post-bariatric surgery. Blood samples were collected for serum biomarkers and metabolomic profiling. Hepatic steatosis [proton density fat fraction (PDFF)] and fibroinflammation (cT1) were quantified with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), and hepatic stiffness with magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). Amino acids and acylcarnitines were measured with mass spectrometry. Statistical analyses included paired Student's t-test, Wilcoxon-signed rank test, and Pearson's correlation. RESULTS: Eight participants provided complete data. At baseline, all had hepatic steatosis (BMI 39.3 ± 5.6 kg/m2, PDFF ≥5%). Post-surgery reductions in PDFF (from 12.4 ± 6.7% to 6.2 ± 2.8%, p = 0.013) and cT1 (from 823.3 ± 85.4 ms to 757.5 ± 41.6 ms, p = 0.039) were significant, along with the GSG index (from 0.272 ± 0.03 to 0.157 ± 0.05, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The GSG index can potentially be developed as a marker for monitoring the response of patients with NAFLD to bariatric surgery.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious psychiatric condition that is associated with a high risk for suicide attempts (SAs) and death by suicide. However, relatively little is known about the pathophysiology of BPD. The metabotropic glutamate 5 receptor (mGlu5) has been specifically implicated in the pathophysiology of BPD and SAs, with more general roles in emotion regulation, social and cognitive functioning, and pain processing. Here, we examined the relationship between mGlu5 availability, BPD, and SAs in vivo for the first time. METHODS: Eighteen individuals with BPD, 18 healthy control participants matched on age, sex, and smoking status, and 18 clinical comparison control participants with major depressive disorder completed comprehensive clinical assessments and participated in an [18F]FPEB positron emission tomography scan to measure mGlu5 availability. The volume of distribution (VT) in the frontolimbic circuit implicated in BPD pathophysiology was the positron emission tomography outcome measure. RESULTS: We observed significantly higher frontolimbic mGlu5 availability in the BPD group than in both the healthy control group (p = .009, d = 0.84, 18.43% difference) and the major depressive disorder group (p = .03, d = 0.69, 15.21% difference). In the BPD, but not the major depressive disorder group, higher mGlu5 availability was also associated with a history of SAs (19-25% higher, ps = .02-.005). Furthermore, mGlu5 availability was positively correlated with risk factors for suicide (e.g., sexual victimization, perceived burdensomeness) in individuals with BPD and a history of SA. CONCLUSIONS: Results show higher mGlu5 availability in BPD and SA for the first time. Our preliminary findings suggest that mGlu5 may be a critical treatment target for BPD symptoms, including SAs, and warrant additional investigation in larger samples.",

In the striatum, glutamatergic afferents initiate the activity of GABAergic medium spiny neurons. This study addressed whether traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects GABA and glutamate extracellular levels in the dorsal striatum as an indicator of effects on the cortico-striatal pathway, in rats with motor deficits and recovered animals. Animals were assigned to a sham group, a TBI-alone group, and a TBI + striatal injury group (local injection of a FeCl2 solution to mimic hemorrhagic lesion). In the TBI-alone and TBI + striatal injury groups, motor deficits were accompanied by decreased extracellular GABA and glutamate levels in the striatum at 3 days post-injury. The TBI + striatal injury group showed higher motor deficits, which lasted 7 days longer, and GABA levels were significantly different compared to the TBI alone group. At 18 days post-injury, in recovered rats from the TBI-alone group GABA and glutamate levels returned to control levels. Alterations in extracellular GABA and glutamate levels indicate damage to the cortico-striatal pathway, underscoring the importance of studying this pathway for treatment and recovery after TBI.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress induced by glutamate is a significant contributor to neuronal cell damage and can lead to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and ischemic brain injury. At the cellular level, oxidative stress increases Ca2+ ion influx and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which activate the MAPK signaling pathway. Additionally, the generation of ROS causes mitochondrial dysfunction, triggering apoptosis by promoting the translocation of AIF to the nucleus from the mitochondria. The neuroprotective potential of Polyscias guilfoylei has not yet been reported. Therefore, in this study, the ethanol extract of Polyscias guilfoylei (EEPG) was examined for its protective effect against oxidative cell damage caused by glutamate in neuronal cells. EEPG treatment increased the viability of HT22 cells exposed to high concentrations of glutamate. Cellular Ca2+ ion influx and ROS generation decreased with EEPG treatment in glutamate-treated HT22 cells. EEPG treatment inhibited MAPK activation and AIF nuclear translocation. In an in vivo study, EEPG attenuated brain cell death in an ischemic brain injury rat model. This study demonstrates the potential therapeutic effects of Polyscias guilfoylei in the treatment of ischemic brain injury.",

However, the effects of chestnut honey or the ethyl acetate fraction of chestnut honey (EACH) on neurodegenerative diseases and their related cognitive impairment and neurotoxicity have not yet been established. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the mitigating effect of the EACH on scopolamine (SCO)-injected cognitive decline in mice and glutamate-exposed neurotoxicity in HT22 cells. EACH administration significantly reversed SCO-induced cognitive decline in mice, as demonstrated through the Morris water maze and passive avoidance tests. The EACH treatment showed a significant alleviation effect by recovering more than 80% of the cell viability decrease induced by glutamate exposure in the HT22 neuronal cell model. Furthermore, the EACH significantly reduced reactive oxygen species accumulation, lactate dehydrogenase release, mitochondrial depolarization, and neuronal apoptosis. The EACH regulated the level of apoptosis-related proteins, induced the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) and the expression of related antioxidant proteins, and induced the phosphorylation of tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (TrkB)/cAMP-calcium response element-binding protein (CREB) and the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. These data indicate that the EACH can prevent neurons from oxidative damage and improve cognitive dysfunction by activating Nrf-2 and TrkB/CREB signaling pathways. Therefore, the EACH demonstrates potential therapeutic value in mitigating oxidative stress-induced neurotoxicity, cognitive decline, and related neurodegenerative diseases."

      "abstract": "Resistance to current antimalarial drugs is steadily increasing, and new drugs are required. Drug efficacy trials remain the gold standard to assess the effectiveness of a given drug. The World Health Organization (WHO)'s recommendation for the optimal duration of follow-up for assessing antimalarial efficacy is a minimum of 28 days. However, assessing antimalarial drug efficacy in highly endemic regions can be challenging due to the potential risks of acquiring a new infection in the follow-up period, and thus, it may underestimate the efficacy of the given drugs. A new treatment should be introduced if treatment failure rates exceed 10%. Overestimation occurs as a result of retaining a drug with a clinical efficacy of less than 90% with increases in morbidity and mortality, while underestimation may occur due to a misclassification of new infections as treatment failures with tremendous clinical and economic implications. Therefore, molecular genotyping is necessary to distinguish true new infections from treatment failures to ensure accuracy in determining antimalarial efficacy. There are three genetic markers that are commonly used in antimalarial efficiency trials to discriminate between treatment failures and new infections. These include merozoite surface protein 1 (msp-1), merozoite surface protein 2 (msp-2), and glutamate-rich protein (glurp). The genotyping of P. falciparum by nested polymerase chain reaction (n-PCR) targeting these markers is discussed with the inherent limitations and uncertainties associated with the PCR technique and limitations enforced by the parasite's biology itself."

      "abstract": "Oxysophocarpine (OSC), a quinolizidine alkaloid, shows neuroprotective potential, though its mechanisms are unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of OSC through the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/ heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) signaling pathway using the HT-22 cell line. Assessments of cell viability were conducted utilizing the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Assessments of oxidative stress (OS) were conducted through the quantification of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The integrity of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was scrutinized using fluorescent probe technology. Apoptosis levels were quantified using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. The trafficking of Nrf2 within the cell nucleus was examined through immunofluorescence analysis. Furthermore, Western blotting (WB) was applied to evaluate the expression levels of proteins implicated in apoptosis and the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. To further probe the influence of OSC on the overexpression of antioxidant enzymes, cells were subjected to transfection with HO-1 siRNA. The results showed that OSC inhibited glutamate-induced OS, as evidenced by reduced cell viability and ROS levels. Furthermore, the apoptotic condition induced by glutamate in HT-22 cells was significantly reduced following OSC treatment. More interestingly, the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway was upregulated following OSC treatment. These results suggest that OSC can exert neuroprotective effects by regulating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway to inhibit neuronal cell apoptosis, potentially aiding in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases."

      "abstract": "Internet gaming disorder (IGD) is increasingly recognized as a public concern for its adverse impacts on cognition and mental health. In IGD, the transition from goal-directed actions to habitual and eventually compulsive behaviors is accompanied by altered neural response within the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), a critical region involved in conscious actions. However, the neurochemical profile of the dACC in IGD and its relationship with behavioral awareness remain poorly understood. In this study, 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy was employed to quantify dACC glutamate concentration and examine its association with the capacity for 'acting with awareness' among 21 participants with IGD and 19 recreational game users. Results indicated that dACC glutamate levels and behavioral awareness were significantly lower in the IGD group compared to recreational game users. Moreover, a significant positive correlation between awareness and dACC glutamate concentration emerged in the recreational game users' group, a relationship attenuated in those with IGD. In an independent cohort of 107 participants, the positive association between awareness and dACC glutamate concentration was replicated. These findings suggest that reduced dACC glutamate in IGD may underlie diminished awareness of maladaptive habitual behaviors. Enhancing dACC neural excitability through neuromodulation or mindfulness training could represent a potential intervention to restore behavioral awareness.",

This study aimed to evaluate the neurotoxic effect of MSG on NSCs and hippocampal neurogenesis in a rodent model. In vitro studies showed that MSG induces cytotoxicity in primary neuron cultures but has no toxic effect on NSCs. Furthermore, in vivo studies on 4-week-old male C57BL/6 mice orally administered MSG and sodium chloride (NaCl) for two weeks revealed that neither MSG nor NaCl induced changes in the expressions of neuronal markers or glutamate receptors in the hippocampus. In addition, no differences in NSC proliferation or survival were detected, and MSG did not adversely affect the neuronal differentiation of NSCs. Moreover, neurobehavioral tests showed that MSG treatment did not impair spatial learning and memory. These findings provide a first assessment of the neurotoxic effects of MSG on NSCs and hippocampal neurogenesis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have implicated hippocampal abnormalities in the neuropathology of psychosis spectrum disorders. Reduced hippocampal volume has been reported across all illness stages, and this atrophy has been hypothesized to be the result of glutamatergic excess. To test this hypothesis, we measured hippocampal subfield volumes and hippocampal glutamate levels in antipsychotic naïve first episode psychosis patients (FEP) and the progression of volume decline and changes in glutamate levels over a 16-week antipsychotic drug (APD) trial. We aimed to determine if subfield volumes at baseline were associated with glutamate levels, and if baseline glutamate levels were predictive of change in subfield volumes over time. METHODS: We enrolled ninety-three medication-naïve FEP participants and 80 matched healthy controls (HC). T1 and T2 weighted images and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data from a voxel prescribed in the left hippocampus were collected from participants at baseline and after 6 and 16 weeks of APD treatment. Hippocampal subfield volumes were assessed using FreeSurfer 7.1.1., while glutamate levels were quantified using jMRUI version 6.0. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models. RESULTS: We found regional subfield volume deficits in the CA1, and presubiculum in FEP at baseline, that further expanded to include the molecular and granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (GC/ML/DG) and CA4 by week 16. Baseline hippocampal glutamate levels in FEP were not significantly different than those of HC, and there was no effect of treatment on glutamate. Glutamate levels were not related to initial subfield volumes or volume changes over 16 weeks. CONCLUSION: We report a progressive loss of hippocampal subfield volumes over a period of 16 weeks after initiation of treatment, suggestive of early progression in neuropathology. Our results do not suggest a role for glutamate as a driving factor. This study underscores the need to further research the mechanism(s) underlying this phenomenon as it has implications for early intervention to preserve cognitive decline in FEP participants.",

      "abstract": "The metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGlu2) is a heavily studied therapeutic target in neuropsychiatry for which we anticipate a renewed interest in the near future. We review the rationale and the outcome of clinical trials with mGlu2/3 receptor agonists in schizophrenia, a field of intense research since a seminal publication by Patel and colleagues (2007). We summarize evidence about selective, potent and safe agents with quantifiable CNS penetration that can be used to test hypotheses of mGlu2 receptors involvement in neuropsychiatric diseases. We summarize lessons learned from previous programs that should be considered to maximize the probability of success when targeting orthosteric and allosteric enhancement of mGlu2 receptor function in schizophrenia and beyond. First, we propose expanding our focus beyond presynaptic mGlu2 receptor stimulation in schizophrenia to novel hypotheses and that the choice of a therapeutic indication no longer be dictated by commercial opportunity but following science as a driver. Second, evidence on internal validity of preclinical studies supporting efficacy claims in the mGlu2 field is very limited. This gap will need to be closed when reviewing the rationale to re-initiate efforts in this field. Third, the pomaglumetad program was halted due to insufficient clinical efficacy, partly because of the inability to identify a treatment responder population. In preclinical studies, effects of mGlu2/3 receptor stimulation also seemed to vary significantly between laboratories. Definition of the responsive subject population and development of response-predicting biomarkers is therefore one of the main avenues of further research in the mGlu2 field.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Dysregulation and loss of immune tolerance toward pancreatic β-cell autoantigens are features of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Until recently, life-long insulin injection was the only approved treatment for T1D, but it does not address the underlying disease pathology. The aim for antigen-specific immunotherapy (ASI) is to restore tolerance. ASI holds potential as a new therapeutic strategy for treating autoimmune diseases with well-characterized antigens. Peptide ASI using processing-independent CD4+ T-cell epitopes (PIPs) shows promising results in several autoimmune diseases. Here, we successfully applied the principles of PIP design to the T1D autoantigen glutamate decarboxylase 65 (GAD65). Peptides spanning GAD65 predicted to be pan-HLA-DR binding were selected. Peptide 10 (P10) displayed enriched responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from people with T1D. The minimal epitope of the P10 peptide was fine mapped using T-cell hybridomas generated from HLA-DRB1*04:01 transgenic mice. This minimal epitope, P10Sol, was demonstrated, using a novel activation-induced marker assay, to induce tolerance to the parent peptide in the transgenic mice. Finally, we show that GAD65 P10Sol PIP is recognized by CD4+ T cells from people with T1D who possess a range of HLA-DR alleles and, therefore, can be defined as a pan-DR-binding peptide with therapeutic potential. ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS: There are currently no approved antigen-specific immunotherapies (ASIs) for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). We aimed to develop a peptide for ASI for T1D based on the T1D-associated auto-antigen glutamate decarboxylase 65 (GAD65). A minimal and soluble peptide derived from GAD65 was demonstrated to induce tolerance in an HLA transgenic mouse. Our data suggest this peptide derived from the GAD65 islet protein should be tested for therapeutic potential in people with T1D who have residual β-cell function.",

      "abstract": "Ménière's disease (MD) is a complex inner ear disorder characterized by a range of symptoms, with its pathogenesis linked to immune-related mechanisms. Our previous research demonstrated that IL-1β maturation and release can trigger cell pyroptosis, exacerbating the severity of the endolymphatic hydrops in a mouse model; however, the specific mechanism through which IL-1β influences MD symptoms remains unclear. This study conducted on patients with MD examined changes in protein signatures in the vestibular end organs (VO) and endolymphatic sac (ES) using mass spectrometry. Gene ontology and protein pathway analyses showed that differentially expressed proteins in the ES are closely related to adhesion, whereas those in the VO are related to synapse processes. Additionally, the study found elevated expression of Glutaminase (GLS) in the VO of MD patients compared to controls. Further investigations revealed that IL-1β increased glutamate levels by upregulating GLS expression in HEI-OC1 cells. Treatment with a GLS inhibitor or an IL-1β receptor antagonist alleviated auditory-vestibular dysfunction and reduced glutamate levels in mice with endolymphatic hydrops. These findings collectively suggest that imbalanced neurotransmitter release and immune responses contribute to the pathology of MD, potentially explaining the hearing loss and vertigo associated with the disease and offering new avenues for therapeutic interventions."

      "abstract": "Treatment-resistance in patients with schizophrenia is a major obstacle for improving outcome in patients, especially in those not gaining from clozapine. Novel research implies that glutamatergic and GABAergic abnormalities may be present in treatment-resistant patients, and preclinical research suggests that clozapine affects the GABAergic system. Moreover, clozapine may have a neuroprotective role. To investigate these issues, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate the relationship between clozapine and in vivo measures of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate (glu), and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) brain levels in treatment- and ultra-treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients (TRS and UTRS). Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we included three longitudinal and six cross sectional studies utilizing proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS) that explored brain metabolite levels in clozapine-treated patients. Findings were limited by a small number of studies and definite conclusions cannot be drawn, but the present studies may imply that clozapine reduces glutamate levels in striatal but not cortical areas, whereas glutamatergic metabolites and GABA levels may be increased in ACC in the combined group of TRS and UTRS. Clozapine may also increase NAA in cortical areas. Importantly, this review highlights the need for further clinical studies investigating the effect of clozapine on brain levels of glutamate, GABA, and NAA as well as metabolite group differences in patients with UTRS compared with TRS.",

To demonstrate its potential clinical utility, a new human recombinant form of GOT (rGOT) was produced for medical use. We tested the pharmacokinetics and evaluated the protective efficacy of rGOT in rodent and non-human primate models that reflected clinical stroke conditions. We found that continuous intravenous administration of rGOT within the first 8 h after ischemic onset significantly reduced the infarct size in both severe (30%) and mild lesions (48%). Cerebrospinal fluid and proteomics analysis, in combination with positron emission tomography imaging, indicated that rGOT can reach the brain and induce cytoprotective autophagy and induce local protection by alleviating neuronal apoptosis. Our results suggest that rGOT can be safely used immediately in patients suspected of having a stroke. This study requires further validation in clinical stroke populations."

      "abstract": "One aspect of glutamate (Glut) toxicity may be the opening of the blood-brain barrier to albumin (Al), which in itself can cause nerve cell death. Quercetin (Q) is a polyphenolic substance and has a neuroprotective effect. Cerium oxide nanoparticles (Ce2O3NPs) are highly interested in biological applications due to their antioxidant properties. The current study aimed to investigate the impact of Q-immobilized Al+Ce2O3NPs in Glut-induced neurotoxicity, mainly focusing on cell viability and neurobiochemical changes. Hydrothermal synthesis and characterization of Q-immobilized Al+Ce2O3NPs were performed. After preparing the primary neuron culture, it was exposed to Glut to induce neurotoxicity. Then, various doses of Ce2O3NP, Al+Ce2O3NP, and Q+Al+Ce2O3NPs (1, 5, 10, and 25 µg/ml) were applied to the wells and incubated for 24 h. Then, cell viability was determined by MTT analysis. Additionally, oxidative stress parameters were measured. When the obtained data were examined, it was shown that cell viability decreased with Glut concentration but significantly increased with Q+Al+Ce2O3NPs treatment. When oxidative stress markers were considered, Glut treatment increased LDH, AChE, and TOS levels, while TAC and GSH levels decreased. However, the trend changed after Q+Al+Ce2O3NPs treatment, suggesting that damaged neurons were protected against oxidative stress. The results of this study indicate that Q+Al+Ce2O3NP can ameliorate Glut-induced neurotoxicity, especially when used at a dose of 25 µg/ml.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Excitotoxicity is a common hallmark of epilepsy and other neurological diseases associated with elevated extracellular glutamate levels. Thus, here, we studied the protective effects of (R)-AS-1, a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of glutamate uptake in epilepsy models. METHODS: (R)-AS-1 was evaluated in a range of acute and chronic seizure models, while its adverse effect profile was assessed in a panel of standard tests in rodents. The effect of (R)-AS-1 on glutamate uptake was assessed in COS-7 cells expressing the transporter. WAY 213613, a selective competitive EAAT2 inhibitor, was used to probe the reversal of the enhanced glutamate uptake in the same transporter expression system. Confocal microscopy and Western blotting analyses were used to study a potential influence of (R)-AS-1 on GLT-1 expression in mice. RESULTS: (R)-AS-1 showed robust protection in a panel of animal models of seizures and epilepsy, including the maximal electroshock- and 6 Hz-induced seizures, corneal kindling, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, lamotrigine-resistant amygdala kindling, as well as seizures induced by pilocarpine or Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus. Importantly, (R)-AS-1 displayed a favorable adverse effect profile in the rotarod, the minimal motor impairment, and the Irwin tests. (R)-AS-1 enhanced glutamate uptake in vitro and this effect was abolished by WAY 213613, while no influence on GLT-1 expression in vivo was observed after repeated treatment. INTERPRETATION: Collectively, our results show that (R)-AS-1 has favorable tolerability and provides robust preclinical efficacy against seizures. Thus, allosteric enhancement of EAAT2 function could offer a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of epilepsy and potentially other neurological disorders associated with glutamate excitotoxicity.

      "abstract": "In diabetic patients, repeated episodes of hypoglycemia can increase glucose variability (GV), which may lead to glutamate neurotoxicity in the brain and consequently affect cognitive functions. Astrocytes play a crucial role in regulating the balance of glutamate within the brain, and their function is influenced by the histamine receptor (HR) signaling pathway. However, the specific role of this mechanism under conditions of high GV is not yet clear. The results showed that increased GV resulted in decreased expression of HRs in mice hippocampus and astrocytes cultured in vitro. Additionally, a decrease in the expression of proteins related to glutamate metabolic clearance was observed, accompanied by a reduction in glutamate reuptake capacity. Notably, the intervention with histidine/histamine was able to reverse the above changes. Further mechanistic studies showed that inhibition of HRs that increased GV led to significant disturbances in astrocytic mitochondrial function. These abnormalities encompassed increased fragmentation morphology and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, accompanied by decreased mitochondrial respiratory capacity and dysregulation of dynamics. Distinct HR subtypes exhibited variations in the modulation of mitochondrial function, with H3R demonstrating the most pronounced impact. The overexpression of H3R could enhance glutamate metabolic by reversing disturbances in mitochondrial dynamics. Therefore, this study suggests that H3R is able to maintain glutamate metabolic clearance capacity and exert neuroprotective effects in astrocytes that increased GV by regulating mitochondrial dynamic balance. This provides an important basis for potential therapeutic targets for diabetes-related cognitive dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have a heightened risk of epilepsy. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well-understood. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to elucidate the role of the glutamate-glutamine cycle in this mechanism and test the effect of ceftriaxone, a glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) enhancer, on seizure susceptibility in the Tg2576 mouse model of AD. METHODS: First, we assessed expression levels of key proteins in the glutamate-glutamine cycle in Tg2576 (n = 7) and wild-type littermates (n = 7), and subsequently in the kindling model of epilepsy (n = 6) and sham (n = 6). Then, kindling susceptibility was assessed in three groups: 200 mg/kg ceftriaxone-treated Tg2576 (Tg-Ceft, n = 9); saline-treated Tg2576 (Tg-Sal, n = 9); and saline-treated wild-type (WT-Sal, n = 15). Mice were treated for seven days before kindling, and seizure susceptibility compared between groups. RESULTS: Protein levels of GLT-1 (p = 0.0093) and glutamine synthetase (p = 0.0016) were reduced in cortex of Tg2576 mice, compared to WT. Kindling increased GLT-1 (cortex: p < 0.0001, hippocampus: p = 0.0075), and glutaminase (cortex: p = 0.0044) protein levels, compared to sham. Both Tg-Ceft and WT-Sal displayed Class IV seizures in response to the first stimulation (p > 0.99), while Tg-Sal displayed Class V seizure (p = 0.0212 versus WT-Sal). Seizure susceptibility of Tg-Ceft was not different from Tg-Sal (p > 0.05), and kindling rates did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Disruptions to key components of the glutamate-glutamine cycle are observed in models of AD and epilepsy. However, increasing GLT-1 through ceftriaxone treatment did not influence seizure susceptibility in Tg2576 mice, suggesting this is not an effective strategy to lower seizure susceptibility in AD, or a higher dosage is needed.",

However, depletion of GLS in CRC cells has minimal effect on tumor growth in immunocompromised mice. By contrast, remarkable inhibition of tumor growth is observed in immunocompetent mice when GLS is knocked down. It is found that GLS knockdown in CRC cells enhanced the cytotoxicity of tumor-specific T cells. Furthermore, the single-cell flux estimation analysis (scFEA) of glutamine metabolism revealed that glutamate-to-glutathione (Glu-GSH) flux, downstream of GLS, rather than Glu-to-2-oxoglutarate flux plays a key role in regulating the immune response of CRC cells in the tumor. Mechanistically, inhibition of the Glu-GSH flux activated reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related signaling pathways in tumor cells, thereby increasing the tumor immunogenicity by promoting the activity of the immunoproteasome. The combinatorial therapy of Glu-GSH flux inhibitor and anti-PD-1 antibody exhibited a superior tumor growth inhibitory effect compared to either monotherapy. Taken together, the study provides the first evidence pointing to Glu-GSH flux as a potential therapeutic target for CRC immunotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Recent studies suggest enoxaparin may protect the central nervous system (CNS) from damage. However, its specific effects on glial cells and the underlying mechanisms involving cell death and oxidative stress require further investigation. Therefore, this research investigated enoxaparin's potential to safeguard C6 glioma cells against glutamate-induced cytotoxicity, specifically focusing on its influence on oxidative stress and apoptotic mechanisms. To investigate the neuroprotective effects of enoxaparin against glutamate-induced cytotoxicity in C6 cells, four groups were established: a control group, a group exposed to 10 mM glutamate, a group treated with enoxaparin at concentrations ranging from 25 to 200 µM, and a group receiving both 10 mM glutamate and enoxaparin at concentrations ranging from 25 to 200 µM. Cell viability was measured using an XTT assay. To evaluate the effects of enoxaparin on oxidative stress, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured using ELISA, along with total antioxidant status (TAS) and total oxidant status (TOS). Apoptosis was evaluated using flow cytometry, and caspase-3 activity, a key marker of apoptosis, was assessed using caspase-3 immunofluorescence staining. Enoxaparin at 50, 100, and 200 µM markedly increased cell viability in the enoxaparin + glutamate group. Enoxaparin treatment in the enoxaparin + glutamate group also significantly elevated levels of SOD and TAS, while concurrently decreasing MDA and TOS levels. These changes indicate a reduction in oxidative stress. Enoxaparin treatment further resulted in a significant decline in cleaved caspase-3 levels, a marker of apoptosis. Enoxaparin pre-treatment reduced cell death according to flow cytometry analysis. This study suggests enoxaparin's potential to shield C6 glioma cells from glutamate-induced cell death by mitigating both oxidative stress and apoptotic pathways. More research is needed to confirm this effect.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress causes diverse neurological disorders. Parthanatos is a type of programmed cell death, characterised by strong activation of poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), PAR polymer accumulation, and nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), and is involved in cellular oxidative injury. Signalling by c-Jun-N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) is activated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), and this also contributes to ROS production. However, the exact relationship between JNK signalling and parthanatos in neurological disorders triggered by oxidative stress is unclear. In this study, glutamate-treated HT22 neurons were used to investigate whether the signalling by JNK contributes a regulatory role to parthanatos in oxidative stress-related neurological disease. JNK signalling was activated in glutamate-treated HT22 neurons, demonstrated via upregulation of p-JNK levels. Pre-treatment with SP600125 markedly inhibited JNK signalling, increased cell viability, and significantly reversed PARP-1 overproduction, PAR polymer accumulation, and nuclear AIF translocation. In addition, inhibition of JNK signalling severely reduced the production of both intracellular ROS and mitochondria superoxide. This study indicated that parthanatos in glutamate-treated HT22 neurons could be suppressed by JNK signalling inhibition. JNK activation participated in parthanatos via an increase in intracellular ROS levels.",

      "abstract": "Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) plays an important role in the metabolism of organisms. Its high abundance in mitochondria in particular highlights its core role in cellular physiological processes. GDH catalyzes the mutual conversion between L-glutamic acid and α-ketoglutaric acids. At the same time, this transformation is accompanied by the oxidation-reduction of NAD(H) or NADP(H). This process not only helps to link amino acid metabolism with sugar metabolism, but also helps maintain the balance of intracellular pH and nitrogen homeostasis. In this study, a novel Trichinella spiralis glutamate dehydrogenase (TsGDH) was cloned, expressed and identified. The results revealed that TsGDH was expressed at various stages of development of the nematode T. spiralis, with higher expression levels in the adult worm stage, and was mainly localized in the cuticle, muscular layer, stichosome and female intrauterine embryos. After RNAi treatment, larval natural TsGDH enzyme activity was obviously reduced, and metabolism, molting, growth and reproduction were also significantly inhibited. The results indicate that TsGDH plays an important role in the development and survival of T. spiralis, and it may be a potential molecular target of anti-Trichinella vaccines and drugs.",

      "abstract": "Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC) is a subtype of breast cancer characterized by distinct biological features, and limited glucose uptake coupled with increased reliance on amino acid and lipid metabolism. Our prior studies highlight the importance of glutamate as a key regulator of ILC tumor growth and therapeutic response. Here we examine the expression of four key proteins involved in glutamate transport and metabolism - SLC3A2, SLC7A11, GPX4, and GLUD1/2 - in a racially diverse cohort of 72 estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) ILC and 50 ER+ invasive ductal carcinoma, no special type (IDC/NST) patients with primary disease. All four proteins are associated with increased tumor size in ILC, but not IDC/NST, with SLC3A2 also specifically linked to shorter overall survival and the presence of comorbidities in ILC. Notably, GLUD1/2 expression is associated with ER expression in ILC, and is most strongly associated with increased tumor size and stage in Black women with ILC from our cohort and TCGA. We further explore the effects of GLUD1 inhibition in endocrine therapy-resistant ILC cells using the small-molecule inhibitor R162, which reduces ER protein levels, increases reactive oxygen species, and inhibits oxidative phosphorylation. These findings highlight a potentially important role for glutamate metabolism in ILC, particularly for Black women, and position several of these glutamate-handling proteins as potential targets for therapeutic intervention in ILC."

Ion pairing has been employed in cosmetic formulations to enhance solubility in solvents and improve skin permeability. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the cosmetic formula \"RE:pair (arginine-glutamate ion pair)\", we analyzed scar size, itching and pain, skin barrier function, scar scale evaluation, and satisfaction in our study participants. Methods: A total of 10 patients were recruited, and the formula was used twice a day for up to 4 weeks. Results: Itching was significantly alleviated after 4 weeks of treatment (95% CI = -0.11-1.71) compared to before application (95% CI = 2.11-4.68). Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) showed an 11% improvement after 4 weeks (95% CI = 3.43-8.83) compared to before application (95% CI = 3.93-9.88), and skin coreneum hydration (SCH) showed a significant 41% improvement after 4 weeks (95% CI = 43.01-62.38) compared to before application (95% CI = 20.94-40.65). Conclusions: Based on the confirmation that RE:pair improves skin barrier function and relieves itching, it is likely to be used as a topical treatment for burn scars pending evaluation in follow-up studies (IRB no. HG2023-016)."
