      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High-altitude exposure has been associated with an increased risk of hyperuricemia (HU) and gout, though the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the serum metabolome and phenome in both discovery and validation cohorts of Han Chinese individuals who underwent long-term moderate-altitude exposure (∼12 months), as well as in an independent cohort consisting of local Han Chinese and Tibetans residing in Nyingchi (>5 years). Beta-Alanine intervention was applied in hypoxanthine and potassium oxonate-induced in vitro and in vivo experiments. RESULTS: Individuals exposed to moderate altitude exhibited elevated serum urate and an increase in overall medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), coupled with a decrease in overall amino acids (AAs) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Rmcorr correlation analysis revealed a significant negative association between Beta-Alanine and serum urate, whereas nonanoic acid was in versa, potentially driving lower serum urate in long-term exposed residents. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that Beta-Alanine inhibited xanthine oxidase (XOD) and reversed the HU phenotype in human hepatocytes and mice induced by hypoxanthine (HX) and potassium oxonate (PO), with a urate-lowering effect in mice. Hepatic pathology and transcriptome analysis of HU mice treated with Beta-Alanine indicated that the mechanisms involved the inhibition of XOD, amelioration of the inflammation phenotype in hepatocytes, and promotion of renal urate excretion. Furthermore, the 10-fold cross-validation random forest classification (RFC) predictive modeling based on selected metabolites and phenotypes achieved an area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) value of 0.93 (95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.85-1.00) and 0.79 (95 % CI: 0.59-0.98) for distinguishing individuals with high risk of asymptomatic HU (AHU) in the training dataset and validation dataset, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals serum urate and metabolome altered in moderate-altitude exposed individuals and Beta-Alanine intervention could ameliorate hyperuricemia. Our findings suggest that targeting the circulating metabolome may pave novel avenues to counter diseases associated with HU.",

This randomized, double-blind, placebo (PL) -controlled study aimed to investigate the effects of combined versus single supplementation of creatine (Cr), beta-alanine (BA), and L-citrulline (L-Cit) during short sprint interval training (SSIT) on basketball players' physical and physiological performance over a period of 28 days. METHODS: Forty-eight basketball players were equally assigned to 6 groups of Cr (0.1 g/kg of Cr monohydrate daily), BA (4.8 g daily), L-Cit (6 g daily), combined supplementation, PL, and an active control group, and each group consisted of 8 participants. The training groups participated in SSIT (3 sets of 10 repetitions of 5-s all-out runs) sessions 3 times a week for 4 weeks. Physical (vertical jump, 20-m sprint, Illinois change of direction) and physiological (Wingate anaerobic power and cardiorespiratory fitness test) performance were evaluated before and after the training period. RESULTS: All training groups (Cr, BA, L-Cit, combined, and PL) showed significant improvements in physical and physiological performance over the 4-week intervention (P < .05). Interestingly, the supplement groups displayed significantly (P = .001) greater changes than the PL group, indicating better outcomes in performance adaptations. However, significant differences in performance variables were observed among the supplement groups. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that short-term supplementation with Cr, BA, and L-Cit, as well as a combination of them during SSIT, can significantly improve the physical and physiological performance of basketball players compared to a PL.",

Thirteen healthy and active men underwent a 4-week supplementation period (β-alanine: 6.4 g/d or a placebo) followed by 10-week supplementation combined with high-intensity intermittent training, totaling 14 weeks of intervention. Participants underwent a graded exercise test, while the blood samples for brain-derived neurotrophic factor analysis and the Stroop test (cognitive task) were assessed before and after a high-intensity intermittent exercise (10 runs of 1:1 min effort and a pause ratio at 130% of respiratory compensation point). These measurements were performed three times across the study being at baseline, after 4 weeks of supplementation (POST4weeks) and at the end of the 14 weeks of study (POST14weeks). Compared to baseline values, there were no improvements in brain-derived neurotrophic factor concentrations or Stroop test performance with either β-alanine or high-intensity intermittent training. Lactate peak concentrations in a high-intensity intermittent exercise session also did not differ between groups. However, high-intensity intermittent training did improve some cardiorespiratory parameters (i.e., intensity associated with V̇O2max p=0.01 and respiratory compensation point, p=0.01). In conclusion, β-alanine supplementation alone or associated with high-intensity intermittent training did not improve the brain-derived neurotrophic factor concentrations and Stroop test performance in healthy men."

Therefore, this study aimed to systematically review the evidence regarding the effects of beta-alanine on exercise capacity, muscle strength, and functional performance of older adults. METHODS:  This systematic review was conducted following the specific methodological guidelines of the Preferred Report Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. Furthermore, the Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool was used. The search was carried out in five relevant databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library) from inception up to March 2024. RESULTS:  Of the 1,749 registers identified, only five met the established criteria and were included in this systematic review. A total of 163 older adults (mean age ± SD: 69.1 ± 2.8 years; range: 66.2-72.7 years) were included across all five studies. The majority of studies included participants from both genders. The mean intervention duration ± SD was 11.7 ± 1.0 weeks. The mean daily dosage was 2.7 ± 0.4 g/day (range: 2.4-3.2 g/day). CONCLUSION:  Overall, exercise capacity may be improved following supplementation protocols with dosages ranging from 2.4 to 3.2 g/day. Muscle strength and functional performance do not seem to be improved by beta-alanine since these tasks are not significantly impacted by acidosis buildup."

This led to the hypothesis that β-alanine could also contribute to growth-promoting effects in infected broilers. (2) Methods: An in vitro culture system was developed to assess β-alanine's impact on proinflammatory cytokine response in chicken macrophage cells, gut integrity in chicken intestinal epithelial cells, and muscle differentiation in quail muscle cells and primary chicken embryonic muscle cells. In vivo animal feeding studies were then conducted to investigate the effects of dietary β-alanine on various disease parameters in Eimeria maxima-infected broiler chickens. (3) Results: In vitro, β-alanine treatment significantly decreased the gene expression of cytokines in chicken macrophage cells and increased occuldin expression in chicken intestinal epithelial cells. Dietary β-alanine increased the body weight of chickens following Eimeria maxima infection in the H-ALA group. Dietary β-alanine also suppressed cytokines and increased JAM-2 and occludin expression in the H-ALA group compared to the infected group without β-alanine supplementation. (4) Conclusions: These results strongly support the positive effects of dietary β-alanine on intestinal immune responses and gut barrier function in broiler chickens infected with Eimeria maxima."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to elucidate the impact of combining Beta-Alanine (BA) supplementation with short sprint interval training on cardiorespiratory fitness, anaerobic power, and bio-motor abilities in volleyball players. Twenty young male athletes were randomly divided into 2 equal groups and performed 8 weeks of short sprint interval training while supplementing 4.8 g daily BA or placebo (polydextrose). The players were evaluated for volleyball-specific bio-motor abilities (vertical jump, horizontal jump, spike jump, block jump, 10-m linear sprint, and T-test change of direction speed) and physiological parameters (cardiorespiratory fitness and anaerobic power) pre- and post-intervention. Both groups demonstrated significant (p ≤ 0.05) improvements in all measured variables over time. A time-regimen interaction was observed in jumping ability enhancement from pre- to post-training, wherein BA elicited more significant changes in both vertical and horizontal jumps compared to the placebo. Analyzing residuals in changes and the coefficient of variations (CV) in mean group changes demonstrated that BA supplementation results in uniformly inducing adaptive changes among individuals. Therefore, in light of these results, it is recommended that coaches and trainers take into consideration the utilization of BA as an ergogenic aid to enhance the vertical and horizontal jumps of volleyball players and increase the homogeneity in adaptive responses over the training period.",

      "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) stands out as the most prevalent type of liver cancer and a significant contributor to cancer-related fatalities globally. Metabolic reprogramming, particularly in glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism, plays a crucial role in HCC progression. However, the functions of β-alanine metabolism-related genes (βAMRGs) in HCC remain understudied. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of βAMRGs is required, specifically in HCC. Initially, we explored the pan-cancer landscape of βAMRGs, integrating expression profiles, prognostic values, mutations, and methylation levels. Subsequently, scRNA sequencing results indicated that hepatocytes had the highest scores of β-alanine metabolism. In the process of hepatocyte carcinogenesis, metabolic pathways were further activated. Using βAMRGs scores and expression profiles, we classified HCC patients into three subtypes and examined their prognosis and immune microenvironments. Cluster 3, characterized by the highest βAMRGs scores, displayed the best prognosis, reinforcing β-alanine's significant contribution to HCC pathophysiology. Notably, immune microenvironment, metabolism, and cell death modes significantly varied among the β-alanine subtypes. We developed and validated a novel prognostic panel based on βAMRGs and constructed a nomogram incorporating risk degree and clinicopathological characteristics. Among the model genes, EHHADH has been identified as a protective protein in HCC. Its expression was notably downregulated in tumors and exhibited a close correlation with factors such as tumor staging, grading, and prognosis. Immunohistochemical experiments, conducted using HCC tissue microarrays, substantiated the validation of its expression levels. In conclusion, this study uncovers β-alanine's significant role in HCC for the first time, suggesting new research targets and directions for diagnosis and treatment.",

Despite its worldwide prevalence, there is currently no clear explanation for the mechanism of this disease. In addition, the lack of reliable and accurate biomarkers makes the early detection of PD difficult. Therefore, we examined serum beta-alanine and kynurenine levels and expression of Wnt pathway genes in leukocytes from patients with PD. METHODS: Ninety patients, 45 with PD and 45 healthy subjects, were enrolled in this study. Ten milliliters of blood were drawn from all participants. Serum levels of beta-alanine and kynurenine were measured by ELISA, and the expression of Wnt pathway genes in leukocytes was determined by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Serum levels of kynurenine and beta-alanine were higher in PD patients than in the control group. Data analysis also showed that the expression of some Wnt pathway genes was decreased in leukocytes. CONCLUSIONS: The correlation between serum levels of beta-alanine and kynurenine and the expression of the gene that encodes the Wnt signaling pathway in leukocytes was found in patients with PD. As a result, these biomarkers can be utilized for the early detection, monitoring, and treatment of patients with PD.",

Foliar application of β-alanine is employed to improve salt tolerance in various crops, but the exact mechanism behind it is not yet completely understood. An advanced line SDS-01 of upland cotton Gossypium hirsutum L. was utilized to determine its salt tolerance. Foliar treatment with the β-alanine solution at different concentrations was applied to the seedlings stressed with 0.8% NaCl solution. On the 10th day of treatment, samples were collected for transcriptome and metabolome analyses. β-alanine solution at a concentration of 25 mM was found to be the best treatment with the lowest mortality rate and highest plant height and above-ground biomass under salt stress. Both differentially expressed genes and accumulated metabolites analyses showed improved tolerance of treated seedlings. The photosynthetic efficiency improved in seedlings due to higher expression of photosynthesis-antenna proteins and activation of hormones signal transduction after treatment with β-alanine. Highly expressed transcription factors observed were MYB, HD-ZIP, ARF, MYC, EREB, DELLA, ABF, H2A, H4, WRKY, and HK involved in the positive regulation of salinity tolerance in β-alanine-treated seedlings. Furthermore, compared to the control, the high accumulation of polyamines, coumarins, organic acids, and phenolic compounds in the β-alanine-treated seedlings helped regulate cellular antioxidant (glutathione and L-Cysteine) production. Hence, to improve salt tolerance and productivity in cotton, foliar application of β-alanine at the seedling stage can be a valuable management practice.",

      "abstract": "Background: Increasing evidence suggests that hemodynamic disturbed flow induces endothelial dysfunction via a complex biological process so-called endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndoMT). Recently, DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) was reported as a key molecular mediator to promote EndoMT. Our understanding of how DNMTs, particularly the maintenance DNMTs, DNMT1, coordinate EndoMT is still lacking. Methods: A parallel-plate flow apparatus and perfusion devices were used to apply fluid with endothelial protective pulsatile shear (PS, to mimic the laminar flow) or harmful oscillatory shear (OS, to mimic the disturbed flow) to cultured endothelial cells (ECs). Endothelial lineage tracing mice and conditional EC Dnmt1 knockout mice were subjected to a surgery of carotid partial ligation to generate the flow-accelerated atherogenesis models. Western blotting, quantitative RT-PCR, immunofluorescent staining, methylation-specific PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation, endothelial functional assays, and assessments for neointimal formation and atherosclerosis were performed. Results: Inhibition of DNMTs with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) suppressed the disturbed flow/OS-induced EndoMT, both in cultured cells and the endothelial lineage tracing mice. 5-Aza also ameliorated the downregulation of aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) and β-alanine biosynthesis caused by disturbed flow/OS. Knockdown of the ALDH family proteins, ALDH2, ALDH3A1, and ALDH6A1, showed an EndoMT-induction effect as OS. Supplementation of cells with the functional metabolites of β-alanine, carnosine and acetyl-CoA (acetate), reversed EndoMT, likely via inhibiting the phosphorylation of Smad2/3. Endothelial-specific knockout of Dnmt1 protected the vasculature from disturbed flow-induced remodeling and atherosclerosis. Conclusions: Endothelial DNMT1 acts as one of the key epigenetic factors to mediate the hemodynamically regulated EndoMT at least through repressing the expression of ALDH2, ALDH3A1, and ALDH6A1. Supplementation with carnosine and acetate may have a great potential in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.",

Background: Carnosine (CAR; β-alanyl-L-histidine), a biologically active dipeptide is known for its unique pH-buffering capacity, metal chelating activity, and antioxidant and antiglycation property. β-Alanine (ALA) is a nonessential amino acid and used to enhance performance and cognitive functions. Hypobaric hypoxia (HH)-induced muscle protein loss is regulated by multifaceted signaling pathways. The present study investigated the beneficial effects of CAR and ALA against HH-associated muscle loss. Methodology: Simulated HH exposure was performed in an animal decompression chamber. Gastric oral administration of CAR (50 mg·kg-1) and ALA (450 mg·kg-1) were given daily for 3 days and at the end of the treatment, hindlimb skeletal muscle tissue was excised for western blot and biochemical assays. Results: Cosupplementation of CAR and ALA alone was able to ameliorate the hypoxia-induced inflammation, oxidative stress (FOXO), ER stress (GRP-78), and atrophic signaling (MuRF-1) in the skeletal muscles. Creatinine phospho kinase activity and apoptosis were also decreased in CAR- and ALA-supplemented rats. However, CAR showed enhanced protection in HH-induced muscle loss as CAR supplementation was able to enhance protein concentration, body weight, and decreased the protein oxidation and ALA administration was not able to restore the same. Conclusions: Hence, the present comprehensive study supports the fact that CAR (50 mg·kg-1) is more beneficial as compared with ALA (450 mg·kg-1) in ameliorating the hypoxia-induced skeletal muscle loss.",

      "abstract": "The dipeptide carnosine is a physiologically important molecule in the human body, commonly found in skeletal muscle and brain tissue. Beta-alanine is a limiting precursor of carnosine and is among the most used sports supplements for improving athletic performance. However, carnosine, its metabolite N-acetylcarnosine, and the synthetic derivative zinc-L-carnosine have recently been gaining popularity as supplements in human medicine. These molecules have a wide range of effects-principally with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiglycation, anticarbonylation, calcium-regulatory, immunomodulatory and chelating properties. This review discusses results from recent studies focusing on the impact of this supplementation in several areas of human medicine. We queried PubMed, Web of Science, the National Library of Medicine and the Cochrane Library, employing a search strategy using database-specific keywords. Evidence showed that the supplementation had a beneficial impact in the prevention of sarcopenia, the preservation of cognitive abilities and the improvement of neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, the improvement of diabetes mellitus parameters and symptoms of oral mucositis was seen, as well as the regression of esophagitis and taste disorders after chemotherapy, the protection of the gastrointestinal mucosa and the support of Helicobacter pylori eradication treatment. However, in the areas of senile cataracts, cardiovascular disease, schizophrenia and autistic disorders, the results are inconclusive.",

The study aimed to investigate the effect of β-alanine supplementation on intestinal development and the immune performance of weaned piglets. Thirty-two 21-day-old healthy weaned piglets (half female and half male; Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire) with an initial body weight of 8.11 ± 0.21 kg were randomly divided into 4 groups with 8 replicates of 1 pig each. The control group was fed a basal diet and the three experimental treatment groups were fed diets supplemented with 300, 600 and 1,200 mg/kg β-alanine, respectively. The trial lasted 28 days and the diets fed were divided into 2 phases: the late lactation period (day 1 to 14) and the nursery period (day 15 to 28), during which the weaned piglets had free access to food and water. The regulatory effects of β-alanine were further investigated in vitro using organoids obtained from the jejunum of piglets. In vivo, the addition of β-alanine to the diet had no significant effect on the growth performance of weaned piglets (P > 0.05), but significantly reduced serum levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) (P < 0.01), immunoglobulin M (IgM) (P = 0.005), and complement 3 (C3) (P = 0.017). The serum interleukin- 6 (IL-6) levels (P < 0.01) were significantly reduced in the 1,200 mg/kg treatment group. The addition of β-alanine increased ileal villus height, with the most significant effect at a concentration of 300 mg/kg (P = 0.041). The addition of 600 mg/kg β-alanine significantly up-regulated the expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity (P = 0.020) and the zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) gene (P = 0.049) in the jejunum. Diets supplemented with 300 mg/kg β-alanine significantly increased the number of Ki67 positive cells in the jejunal crypts (P < 0.01). In vitro, β-alanine increased the organoid budding rates (P = 0.001) and the budding height of the crypt significantly (P = 0.004). In conclusion, β-alanine can improve intestinal morphology and barrier function, reduce inflammatory responses and alleviate the adverse effects of weaning stress on piglet intestinal health."

However, no research has been found on the effects of dietary β-alanine in the meat quality control of finishing pigs, which are among the research focus. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of dietary β-alanine supplementation on growth performance, meat quality, carnosine content, amino acid composition and muscular antioxidant capacity of Chinese indigenous Ningxiang pigs. The treatments contained a basal diet (control, CON) and a basal diet supplemented with 600 mg/kg β-alanine. Each treatment group consisted of five pens, with five pigs per pen. Results showed that compared with CON, supplemental β-alanine did not affect the final body weight, average daily gain, average daily feed intake and the feed-to-gain ratio of pigs. Dietary β-alanine supplementation tended to increase the pH45 min (p = 0.071) while decreasing the shear force (p = 0.085) and the drip loss (p = 0.091). Moreover, it improved (p < 0.05) the activities of glutathione peroxidase and catalase and lessened (p < 0.05) malondialdehyde concentration. Added β-alanine in diets of finishing pigs could enhance the concentrations of arginine, alanine, and glutamate (p < 0.05) in the longissimus dorsi muscle and tended to raise the levels of cysteine, glycine and anserine (p = 0.060, p = 0.098 and p = 0.091 respectively). Taken together, our results showed that dietary β-alanine supplementation contributed to the improvement of the carcass traits, meat quality and anserine content, the amelioration of muscle antioxidant capacity and the regulation of amino acid composition in Chinese indigenous Ningxiang pigs.",

Twenty-two female basketball players participated in a randomized, double-blind study. They ingested 6.4 g·day-1 of BA or an isocaloric placebo (dextrose) over 4 weeks. Exercise performance including aerobic (Bruce test), anaerobic (Wingate test), intermittent (Yo-Yo test) and basketball performance (countermovement jump and free throw shots) was measured before and following the intervention. Exercise measures were performed at the lab and free throw shots were undertaken on a wooden indoor basketball court. Blood samples were also collected before and after the exhaustive exercise to assess lactate concentration, creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) activity. The exhaustive exercise test induced an increase in lactate concentration and MDA, CK and LDH activity (all p < 0.05). BA supplementation significantly reduced the lactate response to exhaustive exercise (p = 0.001); however, it had no significant effect on exercise-induced MDA, CK and LDH activity (all p > 0.05). Furthermore, exercise performance measures improved from pre- to post-test regardless of supplement/placebo ingestion (all p < 0.05). BA consumption over 4 weeks significantly reduced lactate accumulation following exhaustive exercise, but had no ergogenic effect in female basketball players. Usual dosing of BA does not seem to exhibit protective effect against oxidative damage."

New treatments that alleviate brain cell damage until blood supply is restored are urgently required. The emerging focus of anti-stroke strategies has been on blood-brain-barrier permeable drugs that exhibit multiple sites of action. Here, we combine single-cell electrophysiology with live-cell imaging to find that β-Alanine (β-Ala) protects key physiological functions of brain cells that are exposed to acute stroke-mimicking conditions in ex vivo brain preparations. β-Ala exerts its neuroprotective action through several distinct pharmacological mechanisms, none of which alone could reproduce the neuroprotective effect. Since β-Ala crosses the blood-brain barrier and is part of a normal human diet, we suggest that it has a strong potential for acute stroke treatment and facilitation of recovery.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Beta-alanine (BA) supplementation increases muscle carnosine, an abundant endogenous antioxidant and pH buffer in skeletal muscle. Carnosine loading promotes exercise capacity in healthy older adults. As patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) suffer from elevated exercise-induced muscle oxidative/carbonyl stress and acidosis, and from reduced muscle carnosine stores, it was investigated whether BA supplementation augments muscle carnosine and induces beneficial changes in exercise capacity, quadriceps function, and muscle oxidative/carbonyl stress in patients with COPD. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized, placebo (PL)-controlled trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02770417), 40 patients (75% male) with COPD (mean ± standard deviation: age 65 ± 6 years; FEV1 % predicted 55 ± 14%) were assigned to 12 weeks oral BA or PL supplementation (3.2 g/day). The primary outcome, i.e. muscle carnosine, was quantified from m. vastus lateralis biopsies obtained before and after intervention. Co-primary outcomes, i.e. incremental and constant work rate cycle capacity, were also assessed. Linear mixed model analyses were performed. Compliance with and side effects of supplement intake and secondary outcomes (quadriceps strength and endurance, and muscle oxidative/carbonyl stress) were also assessed. RESULTS: Beta-alanine supplementation increased muscle carnosine in comparison with PL in patients with COPD (mean difference [95% confidence interval]; +2.82 [1.49-4.14] mmol/kg wet weight; P < 0.001). Maximal incremental cycling capacity (VO2 peak: +0.5 [-0.7 to 1.7] mL/kg/min; P = 0.384, Wpeak: +5 [-1 to 11] W; P = 0.103) and time to exhaustion on the constant work rate cycle test (+28 [-179 to 236] s; P = 0.782) did not change significantly. Compliance with supplement intake was similar in BA (median (quartile 1-quartile 3); 100 (98-100)%) and PL (98 (96-100)%) (P = 0.294) groups, and patients did not report side effects possibly related to supplement intake. No change was observed in secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Beta-alanine supplementation is efficacious in augmenting muscle carnosine (+54% from mean baseline value) without side effects in patients with COPD in comparison with PL. However, accompanied beneficial changes in exercise capacity, quadriceps function, and muscle oxidative/carbonyl stress were not observed.",

It has been suggested that carnosine can elicit an anti-obesity effect via induction and activation of brown/beige adipocytes responsible for non-shivering thermogenesis. However, the relationship between carnosine and brown/beige adipocytes has not been comprehensively elucidated. We hypothesized that β-alanine directly modulates brown/beige adipogenesis and performed an in vitro assessment to test this hypothesis. HB2 brown preadipocytes were differentiated using insulin from day 0. Cells were treated with various concentrations of β-alanine (12.5-100 μM) during adipogenesis (days 0-8) and differentiation (days 8-10). Then, cells were further stimulated with or without forskolin, an activator of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway, on day 8 or day 10 for 4 h before harvesting. We observed that HB2 cells expressed molecules related to the transport and signal transduction of β-alanine. Treatment with β-alanine during brown adipogenesis dose-dependently enhanced forskolin-induced Ucp1 expression; this was not observed in differentiated brown adipocytes. Consistent with these findings, treatment with β-alanine during days 0-8 increased phosphorylation levels of CREB in forskolin-treated HB2 cells. In addition, β-alanine treatment during brown adipogenesis increased the expression of Pparα, known to induce brown/beige adipogenesis, in a dose-dependent manner. These findings revealed that β-alanine could target HB2 adipogenic cells and enhance forskolin-induced Ucp1 expression during brown adipogenesis, possibly by accelerating phosphorylation and activation of CREB. Thus, β-alanine, a carnosine-constituting amino acid, might directly act on brown adipogenic cells to stimulate energy expenditure.",

Characterization was carried out using IR, UV-Vis,1H and 13C NMR and mass spectrum. Present study involves the evaluation of a novel Schiff base as an inhibitor against human breast cancer cell lines (pdb:3GEY) using 2-(dimethylamino)-N-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydrophenanthridin-2-yl) acetamide (DDA) as a native ligand. In silico study of 3GEY inhibitor is a variant of PARP-15, docking with two different ligands (E)-3-((5-bromo-2-hydroxybenzylidene) amino) propanoic acid (SBL) and the native ligand. Synthesized ligandis docked in to the B chain of PARP enzyme binding site to visualize the best docked poseand favorable ligand-protein binding interactions. Swiss ADME tool determines the drug likeness and strongly suggests that SBL can be a promising candidate to fight against breast cancer. DFT studies were done to support the experimental results using B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) and geometry optimization was performed. Various thermodynamic parameters and NLO properties were found out. ECD and VCD spectrum were explained using DFT studies. Vibrational and Raman frequencies were also reported. HOMO-LUMO band gaps, Mulliken charges were calculated and the electrostatic potential surface was mapped with various properties. Experimental findings obtained are in good agreement with that of theoretical DFT analysis."

Treatment included three 6-minute run tests (6-MRT), the first as a baseline, then randomized 6-MRT with low (30 mg·kg-1) and high (45 mg·kg-1) dose BA trials. The 6-MRTs were separated by 72 hours. The main variable of the study was the distance (m) performed in the 6-MRT. Differences between tests were established through ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparison tests (p < 0.05).

Both 30 and 45 mg·kg-1 of BA increased physical performance at maximal aerobic speed in endurance athletes. The acute intake formats described in the present investigation may be helpful for endurance athletes training and competing in aerobic-anaerobic transition zones.",

      "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have emerged as key players in regulating (patho)physiological processes, including inflammation. Members of the Mas-related G protein coupled receptors (MRGPRs), a subfamily of GPCRs, are largely expressed by sensory neurons and known to modulate itch and pain. Several members of MRGPRs are also expressed in mast cells, macrophages, and in cardiovascular tissue, linking them to pseudo-allergic drug reactions and suggesting a pivotal role in the cardiovascular system. However, involvement of the human Mas-related G-protein coupled receptor D (MRGPRD) in the regulation of the inflammatory mediator interleukin 6 (IL-6) has not been demonstrated to date. By stimulating human MRGPRD-expressing HeLa cells with the agonist β-alanine, we observed a release of IL-6. β-alanine-induced signaling through MRGPRD was investigated further by probing downstream signaling effectors along the Gαq/Phospholipase C (PLC) pathway, which results in an IkB kinases (IKK)-mediated canonical activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) and stimulation of IL-6 release. This IL-6 release could be blocked by a Gαq inhibitor (YM-254890), an IKK complex inhibitor (IKK-16), and partly by a PLC inhibitor (U-73122). Additionally, we investigated the constitutive (ligand-independent) and basal activity of MRGPRD and concluded that the observed basal activity of MRGPRD is dependent on the presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the culture medium. Consequently, the dynamic range for IL-6 detection as an assay for β-alanine-mediated activation of MRGPRD is substantially increased by culturing the cells in FBS free medium before treatment. Overall, the observation that MRGPRD mediates the release of IL-6 in an in vitro system, hints at a role as an inflammatory mediator and supports the notion that IL-6 can be used as a marker for MRGPRD activation in an in vitro drug screening assay.",

Taurine is a non-essential amino acid synthesized by cardiomyocytes and the brain and is present in low quantities in many foods, particularly seafood. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether chronic exposure to insulin induces hypertrophy of ventricular cardiomyocytes that are associated with changes in Na+ and Ca2+ homeostasis and whether taurine pre-treatment prevents these effects. Our results showed that chronic treatment with insulin leads to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy that is associated with an increase in basal intracellular Na+ and Ca2+ levels. Furthermore, long-term taurine treatment prevents morphological and ionic remodeling induced by insulin. In addition, blocking the Na+-taurine co-transporter prevented the taurine antihypertrophic effect. Finally, the insulin-induced remodeling of cardiomyocytes was associated with a decrease in the ratio of phospho-CREB (pCREB) to total cAMP response element binding protein (CREB); taurine prevented this effect. In conclusion, our results show that insulin induces ventricular cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via downregulation of the pCREB/tCREB level and that chronic taurine treatment prevents this effect.",

A previous study produced KRC breast meat containing high carnosine content through dietary supplementation with β-alanine or L-histidine; however, the KRC that were fed an L-histidine-supplemented diet produced meat that was significantly more tender. Herein, we performed RNA-Seq to identify candidate genes involved in the regulation of carnosine content and meat toughness. Total RNA was isolated from five female KRC breast muscles in each treatment group that KRC fed diets without supplementation, supplemented with β-alanine or L-histidine. Compared to the non-supplemented group, we identified 118 and 198 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the β-alanine or L-histidine supplementation groups, respectively. Genes potentially related to meat tenderness-i.e., those regulating myosin, collagen, intramuscular fat, and calpain-were upregulated (LOC107051274, ACSBG1, and CAPNS2) and downregulated (MYO7B, MYBPH, SERPINH1, and PGAM1). However, carnosine synthase gene was not identified. Functional enrichment analysis identified pathways affected by dietary supplementation, including the insulin signaling pathway (β-alanine supplementation) and the insulin resistance and adipocytokine signaling pathways (L-histidine supplementation). The FoxO signaling pathway was identified as a regulatory network for both supplementation groups. The identified genes can be used as molecular markers of meat tenderness in slow-growing chickens."

In addition, during the same period, participants were submitted to a resistance training program. Volume index (VI) and the rate of perceived exertion (RPE) were collected during the experimental period for both groups. Significant increases from the first to the last intervention week in VI were observed only for BA (+6.5%, d = 0.61, p = 0.04). In addition, supplementation induced a lower mean RPE (BA: 8.8 ± 0.5 AU vs. PLA: 9.4 ± 0.3 AU, p = 0.02).

A two-factor design was adopted in this study. A total of 640 1-day-old male broilers were assigned to eight treatments with factorial arrangement containing four levels of l-histidine (0, 650, 1300, or 1950 mg/kg) and two levels of beta-alanine (0 or 1200 mg/kg) supplementation; 0 mg/kg histidine and/or 0 mg/kg were treated as control groups. Each treatment including eight replicates with 10 birds each and the feeding trial lasted for 42 days. Dietary supplementation with l-histidine and beta-alanine did not affect average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of broilers during the grower (22-42 days) and the entire phase (1-42 days), compared with the control group (p > 0.05). The only exception was a significantly reduced ADG in the 1950 mg/kg l-histidine group in the starter period (1-21 days, p < 0.05). l-Histidine at 1950 mg/kg significantly decreased redness (a*) and yellowness (b*) values of the meat at 45 min postmortem (p < 0.05), whereas it increased b* value and pH in breast muscle at 24 h postmortem. Moreover, dietary supplementation with beta-alanine alone or combination with l-histidine significantly increased ΔpH in breast muscle (p < 0.01). Dietary l-histidine markedly increased total superoxide dismutase activity and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) both in breast muscle (p < 0.01) and in plasma (p < 0.01), and it decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration in breast muscle (p < 0.01). Dietary addition of beta-alanine, alone or combination, significantly increased T-AOC in breast muscle (p < 0.01) and markedly decreased MDA content both in breast muscle and in plasma (p < 0.01). Addition of l-histidine and beta-alanine significantly increased muscle peptide (carnosine and anserine) content (p < 0.05) and upregulated the expression of carnosine synthase, transporter of carnosine/ l-histidine, and l-histidine decarboxylase genes (p < 0.05), with greater change occurring in the combination group of 1300 mg/kg l-histidine and 1200 mg/kg beta-alanine. Overall, dietary l-histidine and beta-alanine could improve meat quality and antioxidant capacity, enhance the carnosine and anserine content, and upregulate the gene expression of carnosine synthesis-related enzymes in broilers."

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the food ration bar enriched with β-alanine, L-arginine, and Nigella sativa on athletic performance and inflammation following intense military training. METHODS: This double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted on 54 new cadets. Eligible participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive food ration bars enriched with arginine (2 g/day), β-alanine (2 g/day), and Nigella sativa (2 g/day) or nonenriched food ration bars during a 2-week military training. Aerobic and anaerobic performances were evaluated by the Cooper and RAST tests, respectively. RESULTS: A significant increase in anaerobic powers (min, mean, and max) and a significant reduction in fatigue index were observed in the intervention group as compared to the control group, even after the adjustment for confounding factors. Also, increased levels of hs-CRP and TNF-α following military training were significantly lower in the intervention group as compared to the control group (hs-CRP: 0.55 ± 0.1 versus 2.43 ± 0.1 mg/L; p-value: 0.01; TNF-α: 0.12 ± 0.04 versus 0.62 ± 0.04 pg/ml; p-value: 0.03). No significant changes were observed in VO2 max in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the combination of β-alanine, L-arginine, and Nigella sativa can improve anaerobic performance and reduce inflammation following intense physical activities. Further studies with long-term duration are needed to confirm the cumulative/synergic effects of these ingredients in trained and nontrained subjects."

      "abstract": "Currently, little is known about the extent of interindividual variability in response to beta-alanine (BA) supplementation, nor what proportion of said variability can be attributed to external factors or to the intervention itself (intervention response). To investigate this, individual participant data on the effect of BA supplementation on a high-intensity cycling capacity test (CCT110%) were meta-analyzed. Changes in time to exhaustion (TTE) and muscle carnosine were the primary and secondary outcomes. Multilevel distributional Bayesian models were used to estimate the mean and SD of BA and placebo group change scores. The relative sizes of group SDs were used to infer whether observed variation in change scores were due to intervention or non-intervention-related effects. Six eligible studies were identified, and individual data were obtained from four of these. Analyses showed a group effect of BA supplementation on TTE (7.7, 95% credible interval [CrI] [1.3, 14.3] s) and muscle carnosine (18.1, 95% CrI [14.5, 21.9] mmol/kg DM). A large intervention response variation was identified for muscle carnosine (σIR = 5.8, 95% CrI [4.2, 7.4] mmol/kg DM) while equivalent change score SDs were shown for TTE in both the placebo (16.1, 95% CrI [13.0, 21.3] s) and BA (15.9, 95% CrI [13.0, 20.0] s) conditions, with the probability that SD was greater in placebo being 0.64. In conclusion, the similarity in observed change score SDs between groups for TTE indicates the source of variation is common to both groups, and therefore unrelated to the supplement itself, likely originating instead from external factors such as nutritional intake, sleep patterns, or training status.",

Forty-four women (mean ± SD; age [yrs]: 21.7 ± 3.7; height [cm]: 166.3 ± 6.4; body mass [kg]: 66.1 ± 10.3) were randomly assigned to one of 3 treatment groups. The supplement groups performed HIIT on the cycle ergometer 3 times·wk-1 for 6 weeks. Electromyographic fatigue threshold and EEA were assessed at baseline (PRE), after 3 weeks of training (MID), and after 6 weeks of HIIT (POST). Two 2-way mixed factorial analyses of variance (time [PRE vs. MID vs. POST] × treatment (BA vs. PL vs. CON)] were used to analyze EMGFT and EEA with a predetermined level of significance α of 0.05. For EMGFT, there was no interaction (p = 0.26) and no main effect for time (p = 0.28) nor treatment (p = 0.86); thus, there were no changes in EMGFT regardless of training or supplementation status. For EEA, there was no interaction (p = 0.70) nor treatment (p = 0.79); however, there was a main effect for time (p < 0.01). Our findings indicated that neither training nor supplementation was effective in improving EMGFT in women. Efficiency of electrical activity was altered, potentially because of a learning effect. Coaches and practitioners may not use these tests to monitor training status; however, they may find EEA as a useful tool to track cycling efficiency.",

However, there is still no consensus on the performance benefit of beta-alanine on exercise lasting longer than ten minutes. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of beta-alanine supplementation on running performance and the expression of TauT and PAT1. METHODS: This double-blind, randomized study enrolled 16 long-distance runners (37±8 years) who were randomly allocated to two groups: placebo (PLA) and beta-alanine (BA) (4.8 g/day 1) for four weeks. Maximal oxygen consumption, anthropometry, body composition, and food intake were determined. Before and after the intervention, the athletes undertook a 5000 m running time trial. Venous blood (TauT and PAT1 expressions) and ear lobe capillary blood (lactate) collected before and after exercise. Between tests, we monitored the training variables. RESULTS: The results were analyzed by t-tests and an ANOVA of repeated measures, with Sidak's post hoc (P<0.05). PLA exhibited lower body fat than BA (8.7±2.2 vs. 11.5±2.8%, P=0.04). After supplementation, there was an increase in PAT1 expression in BA when compared to PLA (1.17±0.47 vs. 0.77±0.18, P=0.04). No significant differences were shown for the 5000 m running time in PLA (PRE: 1128±72; POST: 1123±72s) and BA (PRE: 1107±95; POST: 1093±86s). CONCLUSIONS: Although beta-alanine supplementation increased PAT1 expression, there was no statistically significant improvement in 5000 m running performance. However, individual responses should be considered as the BA showed a higher delta than the PLA.",

There is, however, a need to develop a better understanding of the magnitude of effect and the factors associated with positive outcomes. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the effect of carnosine or β-alanine supplementation on markers of glycaemic control and insulin resistance in humans and animals. METHODS: We will perform a systematic search for randomised and non-randomised controlled trials. Studies will be retrieved by searching electronic databases, clinical trial registers, author review, and cross-referencing. Primary outcomes include changes in (i) fasting glucose, (ii) glycated haemoglobin, and (iii) 2-h glucose following a glucose tolerance test. A set of additional outcomes includes other markers of glycaemic control and insulin resistance. Risk of bias (RoB) will be assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool (human studies) and the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) RoB tool (animal studies). Confidence in the cumulative evidence will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. All meta-analyses will be conducted within a Bayesian framework, providing a flexible modelling approach to account for uncertainty in model parameters and underlying structures within the data. DISCUSSION: By including all available human and animal data, we will provide the most comprehensive overview on the topic to date. The results will have implications for those working in prediabetes, diabetes, and metabolic health in general and may lead to the development of new treatment approaches. DISSEMINATION: Study results will be presented at a professional conference and published in a peer-reviewed journal. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: CRD42020191588.",

In this work, we developed a β-alanine surface treatment process on Cu:NiOx HTL that provides J/V hysteresis-free, highly efficient, and thermally stable inverted PSCs. The improved device performance due to β-alanine-treated Cu:NiOx HTL is attributed to the formation of an intimate Cu:NiOx/perovskite interface and reduced charge trap density in the bulk perovskite active layer. The β-alanine surface treatment process on Cu:NiOx HTL eliminates major thermal degradation mechanisms, providing 40 times increased lifetime performance under accelerated heat lifetime conditions. By using the proposed surface treatment, we report optimized devices with high power conversion efficiency (PCE) (up to 15.51%) and up to 1000 h lifetime under accelerated heat lifetime conditions (60 °C, N2)."

Currently, many questions on the nature of the MCarn response to supplementation are open, and the response to these has considerable potential to enhance the efficacy and application of this supplementation strategy. To address these questions, we conducted a systematic review with Bayesian-based meta-analysis of all published aggregate data using a dose response (Emax) model. Meta-regression was used to consider the influence of potential moderators (including dose, sex, age, baseline MCarn, and analysis method used) on the primary outcome. The protocol was designed according to PRISMA guidelines and a three-step screening strategy was undertaken to identify studies that measured the MCarn response to BA supplementation. Additionally, we conducted an original analysis of all available individual data on the MCarn response to BA supplementation from studies conducted within our lab (n = 99). The Emax model indicated that human skeletal muscle has large capacity for non-linear MCarn accumulation, and that commonly used BA supplementation protocols may not come close to saturating muscle carnosine content. Neither baseline values, nor sex, appeared to influence subsequent response to supplementation. Analysis of individual data indicated that MCarn is relatively stable in the absence of intervention, and effectually all participants respond to BA supplementation (99.3% response [95%CrI: 96.2-100])."

However, this condition is often only given poor attention in daily practice and in clinical research. Indeed, several treatments for HFs exist. The most effective is considered to be hormone replacement therapy, but this strategy has been associated with a poor risk-benefit ratio given its link with the development of cancer. Other treatments have been tested and are currently used, but they are usually only poorly effective or cannot be recommended in all patients due to potential side effects or interference with other molecules. Therefore, there is a major need for new treatment options for HFs. β-alanine supplementation is widely used for the enhancement of energetic metabolism and is known to be devoid of any relevant adverse effect. BA has also been widely used for the treatment of HFs. This narrative review will discuss the current pharmacological management of HFs and will present the role of β-alanine in this setting.",

      "abstract": "The study investigated the influence of β-alanine supplementation during a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) program on repeated sprint ability (RSA) performance. This study was randomized, double-blinded, and placebo controlled. Eighteen men performed an incremental running test until exhaustion (TINC) at baseline and followed by 4-wk HIIT (10 × 1-min runs 90% maximal TINC velocity [1-min recovery]). Then, participants were randomized into two groups and performed a 6-wk HIIT associated with supplementation of 6.4 g/day of β-alanine (Gβ) or dextrose (placebo group; GP). Pre- and post-6-wk HIIT + supplementation, participants performed the following tests: 1) TINC; 2) supramaximal running test; and 3) 2 × 6 × 35-m sprints (RSA). Before and immediately after RSA, neuromuscular function was assessed by vertical jumps, maximal isometric voluntary contractions of knee extension, and neuromuscular electrical stimulations. Muscle biopsies were performed to determine muscle carnosine content, muscle buffering capacity in vitro (βmin vitro), and content of phosphofructokinase (PFK), monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4), and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). Both groups showed a significant time effect for maximal oxygen uptake (Gβ: 6.2 ± 3.6% and GP: 6.5 ± 4.2%; P > 0.01); only Gβ showed a time effect for total (-3.0 ± 2.0%; P = 0.001) and best (-3.3 ± 3.0%; P = 0.03) RSA times. A group-by-time interaction was shown after HIIT + Supplementation for muscle carnosine (Gβ: 34.4 ± 2.3 mmol·kg-1·dm-1 and GP: 20.7 ± 3.0 mmol·kg-1·dm-1; P = 0.003) and neuromuscular voluntary activation after RSA (Gβ: 87.2 ± 3.3% and GP: 78.9 ± 12.4%; P = 0.02). No time effect or group-by-time interaction was shown for supramaximal running test performance, βm, and content of PFK, MCT4, and HIF-1α. In summary, β-alanine supplementation during HIIT increased muscle carnosine and attenuated neuromuscular fatigue, which may contribute to an enhancement of RSA performance.NEW & NOTEWORTHY β-Alanine supplementation during a high-intensity interval training program increased repeated sprint performance. The improvement of muscle carnosine content induced by β-alanine supplementation may have contributed to an attenuation of central fatigue during repeated sprint. Overall, β-alanine supplementation may be a useful dietary intervention to prevent fatigue.",

Thirty-one elite athletes (11 sprinters and 20 endurance athletes) participated in the study. Eight-week randomized double-blind, crossover, combined supplementation with BA-ALKplaBCAA&TCM and ALK-BAplaBCAA&TCM was implemented. In the course of the experiment, body composition, aerobic capacity, and selected blood markers were assayed. After BA-ALKplaBCAA&TCM supplementation, total fat-free mass increased in sprinters (p = 0.009). No other differences were found in body composition, respiratory parameters, aerobic capacity, blood lactate concentration, and hematological indices after BA-ALKplaBCAA&TCM/ALK-BAplaBCAA&TCM supplementation. The maximum post-exercise blood ammonia (NH3) concentration decreased in both groups after BA-ALKplaBCAA&TCM supplementation (endurance, p = 0.002; sprint, p < 0.0001). Also, lower NH3 concentrations were observed in endurance athletes in the post-exercise recovery period. The results of our study indicate that combined BCAA, TCM, and BA supplementation is more effective than combined BCAA, TCM and ALK supplementation for an increase in fat-free mass and exercise adaptation, but not for aerobic capacity improvement. Besides, it seems that specific exercise stimuli and the training status are key factors affecting exercise performance, even in athletes using efficient supplementation.",

      "abstract": "β-Alanine supplementation is one of the world's most commonly used sports supplements, and its use as a nutritional strategy in other populations is ever-increasing, due to evidence of pleiotropic ergogenic and therapeutic benefits. Despite its widespread use, there is only limited understanding of potential adverse effects. To address this, a systematic risk assessment and meta-analysis was undertaken. Four databases were searched using keywords and Medical Subject Headings. All human and animal studies that investigated an isolated, oral, β-alanine supplementation strategy were included. Data were extracted according to 5 main outcomes, including 1) side effects reported during longitudinal trials, 2) side effects reported during acute trials, 3) effect of supplementation on circulating health-related biomarkers, 4) effect of supplementation on skeletal muscle taurine and histidine concentration, and 5) outcomes from animal trials. Quality of evidence for outcomes was ascertained using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework, and all quantitative data were meta-analyzed using multilevel models grounded in Bayesian principles. In total, 101 human and 50 animal studies were included. Paraesthesia was the only reported side effect and had an estimated OR of 8.9 [95% credible interval (CrI): 2.2, 32.6] with supplementation relative to placebo. Participants in active treatment groups experienced similar dropout rates to those receiving the placebo treatment. β-Alanine supplementation caused a small increase in circulating alanine aminotransferase concentration (effect size, ES: 0.274, CrI: 0.04, 0.527), although mean data remained well within clinical reference ranges. Meta-analysis of human data showed no main effect of β-alanine supplementation on skeletal muscle taurine (ES: 0.156; 95% CrI: -0.38, 0.72) or histidine (ES: -0.15; 95% CrI: -0.64, 0.33) concentration. A main effect of β-alanine supplementation on taurine concentration was reported for murine models, but only when the daily dose was ≥3% β-alanine in drinking water. The results of this review indicate that β-alanine supplementation within the doses used in the available research designs, does not adversely affect those consuming it.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: β-alanine (βA) supplementation has been shown to increase intramuscular carnosine content and subsequent high-intensity performance in events lasting < 4 minutes (min), which may be dependent on total, as opposed to daily, dose. The ergogenic effect of βA has also been demonstrated for 2000-m rowing performance prompting interest in whether βA may be beneficial for sustained aerobic exercise. This study therefore investigated the effect of two βA dosing strategies on 30-min rowing and subsequent sprint performance. METHODS: Following University Ethics approval, twenty-seven healthy, male rowers (age: 24 ± 2 years; body-height: 1.81 ± 0.02 m; body-mass: 82.3 ± 2.5 kg; body-fat: 14.2 ± 1.0%) were randomised in a double-blind manner to 4 weeks of: i) βA (2.4 g·d- 1, βA1); ii) matched total βA (4.8 g on alternate days, βA2); or iii) cornflour placebo (2.4 g·d- 1, PL). Participants completed a laboratory 30-min rowing time-trial, followed by 3x30-seconds (s) maximal sprint efforts at days 0, 14 and 28 (T1-T3). Total distance (m), average power (W), relative average power (W·kg- 1), cardio-respiratory measures and perceived exertion were assessed for each 10-min split. Blood lactate ([La-]b mmol·L- 1) was monitored pre-post time-trial and following maximal sprint efforts. A 3-way repeated measures ANOVA was employed for main analyses, with Bonferonni post-hoc assessment (P ≤ 0.05). RESULTS: Total 30-min time-trial distance significantly increased from T1-T3 within βA1 only (7397 ± 195 m to 7580 ± 171 m, P = 0.002, ƞp2 = 0.196), including absolute average power (194.8 ± 18.3 W to 204.2 ± 15.5 W, P = 0.04, ƞp2 = 0.115) and relative average power output (2.28 ± 0.15 W·kg- 1 to 2.41 ± 0.12 W·kg- 1, P = 0.031, ƞp2 = 0.122). These findings were potentially explained by within-group significance for the same variables for the first 10 min split (P ≤ 0.01), and for distance covered (P = 0.01) in the second 10-min split. However, no condition x time interactions were observed. No significant effects were found for sprint variables (P > 0.05) with comparable values at T3 for mean distance (βA1: 163.9 ± 3.8 m; βA2: 161.2 ± 3.5 m; PL: 162.7 ± 3.6 m), average power (βA1: 352.7 ± 14.5 W; βA2: 342.2 ± 13.5 W; PL: 348.2 ± 13.9 W) and lactate (βA1: 10.0 ± 0.9 mmol·L- 1; βA2: 9.2 ± 1.1 mmol·L- 1; PL: 8.7 ± 0.9 mmol·L- 1). CONCLUSIONS: Whilst daily βA may confer individual benefits, these results demonstrate limited impact of βA (irrespective of dosing strategy) on 30-min rowing or subsequent sprint performance. Further investigation of βA dosage > 2.4 g·d- 1 and/or chronic intervention periods (> 4-8 weeks) may be warranted based on within-group observations.",

The amphiphilic polymer was self-assembled into a sphere (≈204 nm diameter) with a surface charge of -3 ± 0.5 mV. The doxorubicin was incorporated and the structural changes were analyzed by UV-visible spectroscopy, FT-IR, XRD, Raman, and TGA analysis, while size and morphological analysis was performed by DLS, AFM, SEM, and TEM. The controlled release of drug from the carrier was observed at different pH levels. The enhanced anticancer potential of DOX-loaded polymeric micelle was studied both in vitro and in vivo breast cancer model. The treatment of DOX-loaded polymeric micelle reduces the viability and proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells. From the results of the current investigation it concludes that the DOX-loaded polymeric micelle has enhance anticancer effect and it exhibits its potential effect at the dosage of 5 mg/kg body weight in mammary carcinoma-bearing rats. From the observed results, synthesized DOX-loaded polymeric micelle holds strong anticancer properties compared with free DOX and can be used as a potential carrier in the pharmaceutical industry."

METHODS: Twenty-five healthy male participants (age 27 ± 4 years, height 1.75 ± 0.09 m, body mass 78.9 ± 11.7 kg) were supplemented with 6.4 g day-1 of sustained-release BA (N = 16; CarnoSyn™, NAI, USA) or placebo (PL; N = 9; maltodextrin) for 24 weeks. Resting muscle biopsies of the m. vastus lateralis were taken at 0, 12 and 24 weeks and analysed for taurine content (BA, N = 12; PL, N = 6) using high-performance liquid chromatography. Resting venous blood samples were taken every 4 weeks and analysed for markers of renal, hepatic and muscle function (BA, N = 15; PL, N = 8; aspartate transaminase; alanine aminotransferase; alkaline phosphatase; lactate dehydrogenase; albumin; globulin; creatinine; estimated glomerular filtration rate and creatine kinase). RESULTS: There was a significant main effect of group (p = 0.04) on muscle taurine, with overall lower values in PL, although there was no main effect of time or interaction effect (both p > 0.05) and no differences between specific timepoints (week 0, BA: 33.67 ± 8.18 mmol kg-1 dm, PL: 27.75 ± 4.86 mmol kg-1 dm; week 12, BA: 35.93 ± 8.79 mmol kg-1 dm, PL: 27.67 ± 4.75 mmol kg-1 dm; week 24, BA: 35.42 ± 6.16 mmol kg-1 dm, PL: 31.99 ± 5.60 mmol kg-1 dm). There was no effect of treatment, time or any interaction effects on any blood marker (all p > 0.05) and no self-reported side-effects in these participants throughout the study. CONCLUSIONS: The current study showed that 24 weeks of BA supplementation at 6.4 g day-1 did not significantly affect muscle taurine content, clinical markers of renal, hepatic and muscle function, nor did it result in chronic sensory side-effects, in healthy individuals. Since athletes are likely to engage in chronic supplementation, these data provide important evidence to suggest that supplementation with BA at these doses for up to 24 weeks is safe for healthy individuals.",

Among antineoplastic drugs (ADs), 5-FU and Cape (the new oral prodrug) are the most commonly applied drugs in cancer therapy. The main objective of this study was to develop a reliable method that would be easy to run on a reversed-phase UHPLC system coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. AFBA was derivatized with Sanger's reagent to ensure complete yield of a stable 2,4 dinitrophenil-α-fluoro-β-alanine derivative. This method was based on the use of a mixed-mode anion exchange solid phase extraction enabling urinary extracts to be clear of endogenous interferences affecting quantitative results. The assay was validated in human urine according to FDA criteria with the use of a labeled internal standard (β-alanine-d4) to minimize experimental error. Good accuracy and precision were demonstrated by determining spiked urine QC samples in four consecutive days. The recovery of AFBA was between 70.0 and 82.6%, with a matrix effect that was 12.8%-18.5%. The lower limit of quantitation (LOQ) was 0.5 ng/mL with a coefficient of variation of 5.3%. This assay was successfully applied to determine the levels of this metabolite in a large number of urine samples taken from personnel who were occupationally exposed to ADs.",

Twenty-two male national competitive level water polo players were randomly assigned to receive either 4 weeks of β-alanine (n = 11) or a placebo (n = 11) (i.e., 4.8 g·day-1 for 10 days, then6.4 g·day-1 for 18 days, resulting in 163.2 g over 28 days). The participants performed the TSGET and 3minALL-OUT before and after the supplementation period. There were no significant interaction effects between-groups for any variable, however, the magnitude-based inferences analyses showed a possibly beneficial effect (74%) of β-alanine supplementation on [Formula: see text] compared to placebo treatment (Δ% [post-pre] for Placebo group = -5.2%; Δ% [post-pre] for β-alanine group = +0.7%). Only the β-alanine group presented a significant reduction in [Formula: see text] expressed in absolute values (PRE = 3.3±0.6L·min-1; POST = 3.0±0.4L·min-1; p = .021). Similarly, only the β-alanine group presented a significant increase in critical force (PRE = 51.2±10.4N; POST = 56.5±13.1N; p = .044) and a reduction in the curvature constant parameter (W'; PRE = 2998.0±1103.7N·s; POST = 2224.6±1058.9N·s; p = .049).

METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: normoxia/β-alanine (NB, n = 11), normoxia/placebo (NP, n = 8), normobaric hypoxia/β-alanine (HB, n = 10) and normobaric hypoxia/placebo (HP, n = 9). All participants completed 8 training sessions over 4 weeks on a cycle ergometer either in normobaric hypoxia (oxygen fraction: FiO2 = 14.2%) or normoxia (FiO2 = 20.9%). Participants were instructed to consume a daily dosage of 6.4 g of BA or placebo. Changes in performance in a graded exercise test, repeated-sprint test (RST), and 3-minute all-out test (3MT) were examined before and after training and supplementation. RESULTS: No between-group differences were observed for training volume or supplementation compliance. Anthropometric and hematological measures remained unchanged before and after intervention in all groups. A main effect of training condition was shown for oxygen consumption and power output at respiratory compensation point, average power output during the last sprint of the RST, heart rate recovery following the RST, and total work during the 3MT. These measures in the normobaric hypoxia groups were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the normoxia groups, except for the heart rate recovery following the RST. A main effect of supplement was detected in anaerobic working capacity, with postintervention values in the BA groups being significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated-sprint training in hypoxia improved aerobic performance, exercise tolerance, cardiovascular recovery, and overall working capacity, while BA maintained the anaerobic working capacity. However, BA did not provide additional benefits with respect to attenuating fatigue or enhancing repeated-sprint performance.",

This study employed a parallel group, repeated measures, randomised, double-blinded and placebo-controlled design.

Methods: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 20 recreationally-active males (22 ± 3 y, V°O2peak 3.73 ± 0.44 L·min-1) ingested either BA (6.4 g/d for 28 d) or placebo (PL) (6.4 g/d) for 28 d. Subjects completed an incremental test and two 3-min all-out tests separated by 1-min on a cycle ergometer pre- and post-supplementation. Muscle pH was assessed using 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) during incremental (INC KEE) and intermittent knee-extension exercise (INT KEE). Muscle carnosine content was determined using 1H-MRS. Results: There were no differences in the change in muscle carnosine content from pre- to post-intervention (PL: 1 ± 16% vs. BA: -4 ± 25%) or in muscle pH during INC KEE or INT KEE (P > 0.05) between PL and BA, but blood pH (PL: -0.06 ± 0.10 vs. BA: 0.09 ± 0.13) during the incremental test was elevated post-supplementation in the BA group only (P < 0.05). The changes from pre- to post-supplementation in critical power (PL: -8 ± 18 W vs. BA: -6 ± 17 W) and W' (PL: 1.8 ± 3.3 kJ vs. BA: 1.5 ± 1.7 kJ) were not different between groups. No relationships were detected between muscle carnosine content and indices of exercise performance. Conclusions: BA supplementation had no significant effect on muscle carnosine content and no influence on intramuscular pH during incremental or high-intensity intermittent knee-extension exercise. The small increase in blood pH following BA supplementation was not sufficient to significantly alter the power-duration relationship or exercise performance."

The endurance-based resistance-training program (ERT) was given three times per week and included two sets of 15-25 repetitions on 11 computerized pneumatic machines (alternating upper and lower body) at an intensity of 50% of maximum lifting weight (1RM). Mixed design analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed no significant group × time interactions (p > .05) for any anthropometric or strength measures except 1RM leg press (p = .010). A post hoc analysis revealed significant improvements in 1RM leg press for both the resistance-training groups (p < .001) but no significant between-group difference attributable to beta-alanine. For the 20-repetition chest and leg press tests, no main effects of beta-alanine or group × time interactions for the exercise versus control groups were observed. Pairwise comparisons, however, did reveal significant improvements in peak and average power for both tests and fatigue index for the chest press in resistance-training groups. Although beta-alanine had no effect on any measures, the ERT program did positively affect three performance variables: 1RM, mechanical power, and fatigue patterns during muscular endurance testing. Future research should examine beta-alanine with different dosages and training programs to expand upon our findings using endurance-based resistance training.",

We randomly assigned 540 1-day-old Arbor Acres broilers to 5 dietary treatments supplemented with 0 (control group), 250, 500, 1,000, or 2,000 mg/kg of β-alanine (mg β-alanine per kg feed). Each treatment included 6 replicates of 18 birds. The feeding trial lasted for 42 d. Dietary β-alanine supplementation linearly and quadratically increased the average daily gain (ADG) during the starting period (d 1 to 21, P = 0.02 and P = 0.002). The feed conversion ratio (FCR) decreased quadratically in response to dietary β-alanine supplementation during the starting and entire periods (P < 0.001 and P = 0.003, respectively). For the entire period, the predicted best FCR would be achieved when β-alanine was fed at a level of 1,100 mg/kg from quadratic regression. The concentrations of carnosine and β-alanine in breast muscle increased quadratically with dietary β-alanine supplementation (d 42, P < 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The predicted dietary β-alanine level for highest breast carnosine content was 1,196 mg/kg. Dietary supplementation with β-alanine reduced the taurine concentrations in plasma (d 42, linear and quadratic, P < 0.001). Breast muscle yield increased linearly and quadratically in response to dietary β-alanine addition (d 21, P = 0.017 and P = 0.007). Dietary supplementation with β-alanine quadratically reduced the shear force (P = 0.003), whereas a*45 min and a*24 h values increased quadratically in response to dietary β-alanine supplementation (d 42, P = 0.020 and P = 0.021, respectively). Dietary β-alanine addition quadratically enhanced the expression of carnosine synthase and taurine transporter mRNAs (P < 0.05). Overall, dietary β-alanine supplementation improved growth performance and carnosine content, ameliorated antioxidant capacity and meat quality, and upregulated the gene expression of carnosine synthesis-related enzymes in broiler chicks.",

      "abstract": "Taurine, one of the sulfur-containing amino acids, has several functions in vivo. It has been reported that taurine acts on γ-aminobutyric acid receptors as an agonist and to promote inhibitory neurotransmission. Milk, especially colostrum, contains taurine and it is known that milk taurine is essential for the normal development of offspring. β-Alanine is transported via a taurine transporter and a protein-assisted amino acid transporter, the same ones that transport taurine. The present study aimed to investigate whether the growth and behavior of offspring could be altered by modification of the taurine concentration in milk. Pregnant ICR mice were separated into 3 groups: 1) a control group, 2) a taurine group, and 3) a β-alanine group. During the lactation periods, dams were administered, respectively, with 0.9% saline (10 ml/kg, i.p.), taurine dissolved in 0.9% saline (43 mg/10 ml/kg, i.p.), or β-alanine dissolved in 0.9% saline (31 mg/10 ml/kg, i.p.). Interestingly, the taurine concentration in milk was significantly decreased by the administration of β-alanine, but not altered by the taurine treatment. The body weight of offspring was significantly lower in the β-alanine group. β-Alanine treatment caused a significant decline in taurine concentration in the brains of offspring, and it was negatively correlated with total distance traveled in the open field test at postnatal day 15. Thus, decreased taurine concentration in the brain induced hyperactivity in offspring. These results suggested that milk taurine may have important role of regulating the growth and behavior of offspring.",

Therefore, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to compare the effects of a plyometric training program, with or without beta-alanine supplementation, on maximal-intensity and endurance performance in female soccer players during an in-season training period. Athletes (23.7 ± 2.4 years) were assigned to either a plyometric training group receiving a placebo (PLACEBO, n = 8), a plyometric training group receiving beta-alanine supplementation (BA, n = 8), or a control group receiving placebo without following a plyometric training program (CONTROL, n = 9). Athletes were evaluated for single and repeated jumps and sprints, endurance, and change-of-direction speed performance before and after the intervention. Both plyometric training groups improved in explosive jumping (ES = 0.27 to 1.0), sprinting (ES = 0.31 to 0.78), repeated sprinting (ES = 0.39 to 0.91), 60 s repeated jumping (ES = 0.32 to 0.45), endurance (ES = 0.35 to 0.37), and change-of-direction speed performance (ES = 0.36 to 0.58), whereas no significant changes were observed for the CONTROL group. Nevertheless, compared to the CONTROL group, only the BA group showed greater improvements in endurance, repeated sprinting and repeated jumping performances. It was concluded that beta-alanine supplementation during plyometric training may add further adaptive changes related to endurance, repeated sprinting and jumping ability."

It is a non-proteogenic amino acid, formed in vivo by degradation of carnosine, anserine, balenine, and dihydrouracil. The present study was aimed at investigating the anti-tumor effects of β-alanine in renal and cervical tumor cells. Sulforhodamine-B assay and flow cytometric analysis were used to measure cell viability. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) expression was analyzed using FITC-conjugated fluorescent antibody. The cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content was measured using bioluminescence method. Cell migration was determined by the simple standard-scratch method. β-Alanine reduced renal and cervical cell growth significantly. Percentage of inhibition of renal and cervical tumor cells was increased at higher concentration of β-alanine. LDH expression and ATP content were significantly reduced in renal and cervical tumor cells in a dose-dependent manner. Renal and cervical tumor cell migration were significantly reduced following 10 and 100 mM of β-alanine treatment. In our study, β-alanine exerts no significant effect on normal MDCK cells except a marginal effect at the highest concentration (100 mM). In summary, our experimental data suggest that β-alanine may be a potential anti-tumor agent exhibiting several anti-cancer effects in renal and cervical tumor cells.",

However, the mechanism of 5FU-associated hyperammonemia has not been known. The aim of this study was to reveal the pharmacokinetics of 5-FU-associated hyperammonemia in a recurrent colorectal cancer patient with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). METHODS: We experienced a case of hyperammonemia during mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab therapy for recurrent colorectal cancer. He was a dialyzed patient due to diabetic nephropathy and was registered to prospective blood sampling for pharmacokinetics analysis during chemotherapy. Blood concentrations of 5-FU and its catabolites were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The patient developed hyperammonemia encephalopathy 41 h after the initiation of continuous 5-FU infusion (on the third day). Before onset of hyperammonemia encephalopathy, serum alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL, 59.2 µg/ml) and fluoro mono acetate (FMA, 905.8 ng/ml) were gradually increased. After hemodialysis for hyperammonemia, FBAL and FMA were collaterally decreased and his symptom was improved. Other intermediate catabolites of 5-FU, dihydrofluorouracil, and alpha-fluoro-beta-ureidopropionic acid were not changed. CONCLUSION: We found increases of serum FBAL and FMA under the condition of hyperammonemia in the patient with ESRD during mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab therapy. This research supported the hypothesis that impairment of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle by FMA would cause 5-FU-associated hyperammonemia.",

To date, the effects of β-alanine on oxidative metabolism remain largely unexplored. This work investigated the effects of β-alanine on the expression of proteins which regulate cellular energetics. METHODS: C2C12 myocytes were cultured and differentiated under standard conditions followed by treatment with either β-alanine or isonitrogenous non-metabolizable control D-alanine at 800μM for 24 hours. Metabolic gene and protein expression were quantified by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. Glucose uptake and oxygen consumption were measured via fluorescence using commercially available kits. RESULTS: β-alanine-treated myotubes displayed significantly elevated markers of improved oxidative metabolism including elevated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor β/δ (PPARβ/δ) and mitochondrial transcription factor a (TFAM) which led to increased mitochondrial content (evidenced by concurrent increases in cytochrome c content). Additionally, β-alanine-treated cells exhibited significantly increased oxygen consumption compared to control in a PPARβ/δ-dependent manner. β-alanine significantly enhanced expression of myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF-2) leading to increased glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) content. CONCLUSION: β-alanine appears to increase cellular oxygen consumption as well as the expression of several cellular proteins associated with improved oxidative metabolism, suggesting β-alanine supplementation may provide additional metabolic benefit (although these observations require in vivo experimental verification)."

EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: In this systematic review, a search in PubMed and Bireme databases was performed for the terms \"beta-alanine,\" \"beta-alanine and exercise,\" \"carnosine\" or \"carnosine and exercise\" in the titles or abstracts. We included randomized, clinical trials published between 2005 and 2015. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Twenty-three studies were selected. Most of them included physically active individuals. The mean intervention period was 5.2±1.8 weeks, and mean BA dose was 4.8±1.3 g/day. The main outcome measures were blood lactate, pH, perceived exertion, power and physical working capacity at fatigue threshold. After BA supplementation, no statistically significant difference was observed in total work, exercise performance time, oxygen consumption and time to exhaustion. CONCLUSIONS: BA supplementation seems to improve perceived exertion and biochemical parameters related to muscle fatigue and less evidence was found for improvement in performance.",

      "abstract": "Hyper-beta-alaninemia is a rare metabolic condition that results in elevated plasma and urinary β-alanine levels and is characterized by neurotoxicity, hypotonia, and respiratory distress. It has been proposed that at least some of the symptoms are caused by oxidative stress; however, only limited information is available on the mechanism of reactive oxygen species generation. The present study examines the hypothesis that β-alanine reduces cellular levels of taurine, which are required for normal respiratory chain function; cellular taurine depletion is known to reduce respiratory function and elevate mitochondrial superoxide generation. To test the taurine hypothesis, isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and mouse embryonic fibroblasts were incubated with medium lacking or containing β-alanine. β-alanine treatment led to mitochondrial superoxide accumulation in conjunction with a decrease in oxygen consumption. The defect in β-alanine-mediated respiratory function was detected in permeabilized cells exposed to glutamate/malate but not in cells utilizing succinate, suggesting that β-alanine leads to impaired complex I activity. Taurine treatment limited mitochondrial superoxide generation, supporting a role for taurine in maintaining complex I activity. Also affected by taurine is mitochondrial morphology, as β-alanine-treated fibroblasts undergo fragmentation, a sign of unhealthy mitochondria that is reversed by taurine treatment. If left unaltered, β-alanine-treated fibroblasts also undergo mitochondrial apoptosis, as evidenced by activation of caspases 3 and 9 and the initiation of the mitochondrial permeability transition. Together, these data show that β-alanine mediates changes that reduce ATP generation and enhance oxidative stress, factors that contribute to heart failure.",

We examined whether voluntary wheel running, when combined with dietary supplementation with (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and β-alanine (β-ALA), could improve muscle function and alter gene expression in the gastrocnemius of aged mice. Seventeen-month-old BALB/cByJ mice were given access to a running wheel or remained sedentary for 41 days while receiving either AIN-93M (standard feed) or AIN-93M containing 1.5 mg·kg(-1) EGCG and 3.43 mg·kg(-1) β-ALA. Mice underwent tests over 11 days from day 29 to day 39 of the study period, including muscle function testing (grip strength, treadmill exhaustive fatigue, rotarod). Following a rest day, mice were euthanized and gastrocnemii were collected for analysis of gene expression by quantitative PCR. Voluntary wheel running (VWR) improved rotarod and treadmill exhaustive fatigue performance and maintained grip strength in aged mice, while dietary intervention had no effect. VWR increased gastrocnemius expression of several genes, including those encoding interleukin-6 (Il6, p = 0.001), superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1, p = 0.046), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-α (Ppargc1a, p = 0.013), forkhead box protein O3 (Foxo3, p = 0.005), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf, p = 0.008), while reducing gastrocnemius levels of the lipid peroxidation marker 4-hydroxynonenal (p = 0.019). Dietary intervention alone increased gastrocnemius expression of Ppargc1a (p = 0.033) and genes encoding NAD-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin-1 (Sirt1, p = 0.039), insulin-like growth factor I (Igf1, p = 0.003), and macrophage marker CD11b (Itgam, p = 0.016). Exercise and a diet containing β-ALA and EGCG differentially regulated gene expression in the gastrocnemius of aged mice, while VWR but not dietary intervention improved muscle function.

Fourteen trained cyclists (Age = 24.8 ± 6.7 years; VO2max = 65.4 ± 10.2 mL·kg·min(-1)) participated in this placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Prior to supplementation, subjects completed two (familiarization and baseline) supramaximal cycling bouts until exhaustion (120% pre-supplementation VO2max) and two 1-, 4- and 10-km cycling time trial (TT). Subjects then supplemented orally for 4 weeks with 6.4 g/d placebo or β-alanine and repeated the battery of performance tests. Blood lactate was measured pre-exercise, post-exercise and 5  min post-exercise. β-alanine supplementation elicited significant increases in time to exhaustion (TTE) (17.6 ± 11.5 s; p = 0.013, effect compared with placebo) and was likely to be beneficial to 4-km TT performance time (-7.8 ± 8.1 s; 94% likelihood), despite not being statistically different (p = 0.060). Performance times in the 1- and 10-km TT were not affected by treatment. For the highly trained cyclists in the current study, β-alanine supplementation significantly extended supramaximal cycling TTE and may have provided a worthwhile improvement to 4-km TT performance. However, 1- and 10-km cycling TT performance appears to be unaffected by β-alanine supplementation.",

METHODS: Seventeen overweight men (BMI 25-30 kg/m(2), 41-67 y of age) were included in a randomized crossover intervention study. Subjects ate baked herring-, pickled herring-, and baked beef-based meals in a randomized order and postprandial blood plasma samples were taken over 7 h. Plasma metabolomics were measured with the use of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and areas under the curve for detected metabolites were compared between meals. RESULTS: The plasma postprandial response of 2-aminoadipic acid, a suggested marker of diabetes risk, was 1.6 times higher after the beef meal than after the baked herring meal (P < 0.001). Plasma β-alanine and 4-hydroxyproline both were markedly greater after beef intake than after herring intake (16 and 3.4 times the response of baked herring, respectively; P < 0.001). Herring intake led to a greater plasma postprandial response from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and cetoleic acid compared with beef (17.6 and 150 times greater, respectively; P < 0.001), whereas hippuric acid and benzoic acid were elevated after pickled herring compared with baked herring (5.4 and 43 times higher; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These results in overweight men confirm that DHA and cetoleic acid reflect herring intake, whereas β-alanine and 4-hydroxyproline are potential biomarkers for beef intake. The greater postprandial rise in 2-aminoadipic acid after the beef meal, coupled to its proposed role in stimulating insulin secretion, may have importance in the context of red meat intake and increased diabetes risk. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02381613.",

      "abstract": "Beta-alanine (BA) supplementation increases exercise performance due to increases in the intramuscular lactate buffer, carnosine. Females are more sensitive to these increases and results are further pronounced in trained individuals. Baseline intramuscular carnosine levels also naturally decrease with age; therefore, trained older females may experience augmented benefits from BA supplementation. However, the ability of BA to increase lower-body isokinetic strength (ISO) in female masters athletes (MA) is unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the longitudinal effects of BA supplementation on ISO, handgrip strength (HG), and body composition in female MA cyclists. Twenty-two subjects participated in this double-blind randomized study. Subjects were randomized into 2 groups (placebo [PLA] = 8 g dextrose; BA = 800 mg + 8 g dextrose) and supplemented 4 times per day for 28 days. ISO, HG, and body composition were evaluated at baseline and at the same day/time each week over the 28-day intervention. No differences existed between groups at baseline or at the 7, 14, and 21 days time points for any variables (p > 0.05). When evaluating ISO (isokinetic) after 28 days, total work performed during the final third of the assessment (24.0 vs. -16.8% change) in flexion and average peak torque (5.4 vs. 2.9% change) in extension were significantly increased from baseline in BA compared with PLA (p ≤ 0.05). No differences existed for HG or body composition after supplementation. Twenty-eight days of BA supplementation increased peak torque and work completed, indicating BA improves lower-body exercise performance in female MA.",

      "abstract": "Sprint interval training (SIT), repeated bouts of high-intensity exercise, improves skeletal muscle oxidative capacity and exercise performance. β-alanine (β-ALA) supplementation has been shown to enhance exercise performance, which led us to hypothesize that chronic β-ALA supplementation would augment work capacity during SIT and augment training-induced adaptations in skeletal muscle and performance. Twenty-four active but untrained men (23 ± 2 yr; VO2peak = 50 ± 6 mL · kg(-1) · min(-1)) ingested 3.2 g/day of β-ALA or a placebo (PLA) for a total of 10 weeks (n = 12 per group). Following 4 weeks of baseline supplementation, participants completed a 6-week SIT intervention. Each of 3 weekly sessions consisted of 4-6 Wingate tests, i.e., 30-s bouts of maximal cycling, interspersed with 4 min of recovery. Before and after the 6-week SIT program, participants completed a 250-kJ time trial and a repeated sprint test. Biopsies (v. lateralis) revealed that skeletal muscle carnosine content increased by 33% and 52%, respectively, after 4 and 10 weeks of β-ALA supplementation, but was unchanged in PLA. Total work performed during each training session was similar across treatments. SIT increased markers of mitochondrial content, including cytochome c oxidase (40%) and β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase maximal activities (19%), as well as VO2peak (9%), repeated-sprint capacity (5%), and 250-kJ time trial performance (13%), but there were no differences between treatments for any measure (p < .01, main effects for time; p > .05, interaction effects). The training stimulus may have overwhelmed any potential influence of β-ALA, or the supplementation protocol was insufficient to alter the variables to a detectable extent.",

      "abstract": "Nutrition and physical exercise can enhance cognitive function but the specific combinations of dietary bioactives that maximize pro-cognitive effects are not known nor are the contributing neurobiological mechanisms. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is a flavonoid constituent of many plants with high levels found in green tea. EGCG has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties and is known to cross the blood brain barrier where it can affect brain chemistry and physiology. β-Alanine (B-ALA) is a naturally occurring β-amino acid that could increase cognitive functioning by increasing levels of exercise via increased capacity of skeletal muscle, by crossing the blood brain barrier and acting as a neurotransmitter, or by free radical scavenging in muscle and brain after conversion into carnosine. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of EGCG (~250mg/kg/day), B-ALA (~550mg/kg/day), and their combination with voluntary wheel running exercise on the following outcome measures: body composition, time to fatigue, production of new cells in the granule layer of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus as a marker for neuronal plasticity, and behavioral performance on the contextual and cued fear conditioning tasks, as measures of associative learning and memory. Young adult male BALB/cJ mice approximately 2months old were randomized into 8 groups varying the nutritional supplement in their diet and access to running wheels over a 39day study period. Running increased food intake, decreased fat mass, increased time to exhaustive fatigue, increased numbers of new cells in the granule layer of the hippocampus, and enhanced retrieval of both contextual and cued fear memories. The diets had no effect on their own or in combination with exercise on any of the fitness, plasticity, and behavioral outcome measures other than B-ALA decreased percent body fat whereas EGCG increased lean body mass slightly. Results suggest that, in young adult BALB/cJ mice, a 39day treatment of exercise but not dietary supplementation with B-ALA or EGCG enhances measures of fitness, neuroplasticity and cognition.",

RESULTS: The study demonstrated a significant effect of dietary administration of β-alanine on anserine content in breast muscles and on carnosine content in leg muscles of the chickens. A successive increase in dipeptide content was observed with increasing β-alanine content in the feed mixture. As a result of heat treatment, a significant (P ≤ 0.01) increase was observed in the anserine content of both breast and leg muscles: over twofold higher anserine content was detected in heat-treated muscles compared with raw muscles. The study showed that interesting effects might occur during β-alanine administration to feed mixtures for chickens, especially including increased contents of anserine and carnosine in skeletal muscles of the birds. CONCLUSION: Taking into account the well-documented health-promoting effect of histidine dipeptides and possibilities of increasing their contents in the body by supplementation with β-alanine, anserine and carnosine might be considered as potential components of functional foods.",

METHODS: Forty-four untrained healthy men (aged 20-22 years, weight: 68-72 kg, height: 174-178 cm) participated in the present study. After performing the Wingate Test (WAnT) for three times in the baseline exercise session, the subjects were assigned to one of four treatment groups randomly: 1) placebo (P; 10 g maltodextrose); 2) creatine (Cr; 5 g creatine plus 5 g maltodextrose); 3) beta-alanine (β-ALA; 1,6 g beta alanine plus 8,4 g maltodextrose); and 4) beta-alanine plus creatine (β-ALA+Cr; 1,6 g beta alanine plus 5 g creatine plus 3,4 g maltodextrose). Participants were given the supplements orally twice a day for 22 consecutive days, then four times a day for the following 6 days. After 28 days, the second exercise session was applied during which peak power (PP) and mean power (MP) were measured and fatigue index (FI) was calculated. RESULTS: PP and MP decreased and FI increased in all groups during exercise before and after the treatment. During the postsupplementation session PP2 and PP3 increased in creatine supplemented group (from 642.7±148.6 to 825.1±205.2 in PP2 and from 522.9±117.5 to 683.0±148.0 in PP3, respectively). However, MP increased in β-ALA+Cr during the postsupplementation compared to presupplementation in all exercise sessions (from 586.2±55.4 to 620.6±49.6 in MP1, from 418.1±37.2 to 478.3±30.3 in MP2 and from 362.0±41.3 to 399.1±3 in MP3, respectively). FI did not change with beta alanine and beta alanine plus creatine supplementation during the postsupplementation exercise session. CONCLUSION: Beta-alanine and beta alanine plus creatine supplementations have strong performance enhancing effect by increasing mean power and delaying fatigue Index during the repeated WAnT.",

Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG, a green tea catechin), β-alanine (β-ala, the precursor of carnosine), and exercise have independently been shown to be neuroprotective and to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in the central nervous system. We hypothesized that EGCG, β-ala supplementation or exercise alone would improve learning and memory and increase neurogenesis in aged mice, and the combined intervention would be better than either treatment alone. Male Balb/cByJ mice (19 months) were given AIN-93M diet with or without EGCG (182mg/kg/d) and β-ala (417mg/kg/d). Half of the mice were given access to a running wheel (VWR). The first 10 days, animals received 50mg/kg bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) daily. After 28 days, learning and memory was assessed by Morris water maze (MWM) and contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Brains were collected for immunohistochemical detection of BrdU and quantitative mRNA expression in the hippocampus. VWR increased the number of BrdU cells in the dentate gyrus, increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, decreased expression of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β, and improved performance in the MWM and CFC tests. The dietary intervention reduced brain oxidative stress as measured by 4-hydroxynonenal in the cerebellum, but had no effect on BrdU labeling or behavioral performance. These results suggest that exercise, but not a diet containing EGCG and β-ala, exhibit pro-cognitive effects in aged mice when given at these doses in this relatively short time frame.",

Beta-alanine intervention studies and review articles were collected from 13 databases, and safety information was collected from adverse event reporting portals. Due to the lack of systematic studies involving military populations, all the available literature was assessed with a subgroup analysis of studies on athletes to determine if beta-alanine would be suitable for the military. Available literature provided only limited evidence concerning the benefits of beta-alanine use, and a majority of the studies were not designed to address safety. Overall, the strength of evidence in terms of the potential for risk of bias in the quality of the available literature, consistency, directness, and precision did not support the use of beta-alanine by military personnel. The strength of evidence for a causal relation between beta-alanine and paresthesia was moderate.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Deregulated energetics is a property of most cancer cells. This phenomenon, known as the Warburg Effect or aerobic glycolysis, is characterized by increased glucose uptake, lactate export and extracellular acidification, even in the presence of oxygen. β-alanine is a non-essential amino acid that has previously been shown to be metabolized into carnosine, which functions as an intracellular buffer. Because of this buffering capacity, we investigated the effects of β-alanine on the metabolic cancerous phenotype. METHODS: Non-malignant MCF-10a and malignant MCF-7 breast epithelial cells were treated with β-alanine at 100 mM for 24 hours. Aerobic glycolysis was quantified by measuring extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxidative metabolism was quantified by measuring oxygen consumption rate (OCR). mRNA of metabolism-related genes was quantified by qRT-PCR with corresponding protein expression quantified by immunoblotting, or by flow cytometry which was verified by confocal microscopy. Mitochondrial content was quantified using a mitochondria-specific dye and measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Cells treated with β-alanine displayed significantly suppressed basal and peak ECAR (aerobic glycolysis), with simultaneous increase in glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). Additionally, cells treated with β-alanine exhibited significantly reduced basal and peak OCR (oxidative metabolism), which was accompanied by reduction in mitochondrial content with subsequent suppression of genes which promote mitochondrial biosynthesis. Suppression of glycolytic and oxidative metabolism by β-alanine resulted in the reduction of total metabolic rate, although cell viability was not affected. Because β-alanine treatment reduces extracellular acidity, a constituent of the invasive microenvironment that promotes progression, we investigated the effect of β-alanine on breast cell viability and migration. β-alanine was shown to reduce both cell migration and proliferation without acting in a cytotoxic fashion. Moreover, β-alanine significantly increased malignant cell sensitivity to doxorubicin, suggesting a potential role as a co-therapeutic agent. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results suggest that β-alanine may elicit several anti-tumor effects. Our observations support the need for further investigation into the mechanism(s) of action and specificity of β-alanine as a co-therapeutic agent in the treatment of breast tumors.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Molecular subtyping of breast cancer is necessary for therapy selection and mandatory for all breast cancer patients. Metabolic alterations are considered a hallmark of cancer and several metabolic drugs are currently being investigated in clinical trials. However, the dependence of metabolic alterations on breast cancer subtypes has not been investigated on -omics scale. Thus, 204 estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and 67 estrogen receptor negative (ER-) breast cancer tissues were investigated using GC-TOFMS based metabolomics. 19 metabolites were detected as altered in a predefined training set (2/3 of tumors) and could be validated in a predefined validation set (1/3 of tumors). The metabolite changes included increases in beta-alanine, 2-hydroyglutarate, glutamate, xanthine and decreases in glutamine in the ER- subtype. Beta-alanine demonstrated the strongest change between ER- and ER+ breast cancer (fold change=2.4, p=1.5E-20). In a correlation analysis with genome-wide expression data in a subcohort of 154 tumors, we found a strong negative correlation (Spearman R=-0.62) between beta-alanine and 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase (ABAT). Immunohistological analysis confirmed down-regulation of the ABAT protein in ER- breast cancer. In a Kaplan-Meier analysis of a large external expression data set, the ABAT transcript was demonstrated to be a positive prognostic marker for breast cancer (HR=0.6, p=3.2E-15). BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: It is well-known for more than a decade that breast cancer exhibits distinct gene expression patterns depending on the molecular subtype defined by estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2 status. Here, we show that breast cancer exhibits distinct metabolomics patterns depending on ER status. Our observation supports the current view of ER+ breast cancer and ER- breast as different diseases requiring different treatment strategies. Metabolic drugs for cancer including glutaminase inhibitors are currently under development and tested in clinical trials. We found glutamate enriched and glutamine reduced in ER- breast cancer compared to ER+ breast cancer and compared to normal breast tissues. Thus, metabolomics analysis highlights the ER- subtype as a preferential target for glutaminase inhibitors. For the first time, we report on a regulation of beta-alanine catabolism in cancer. In breast cancer, ABAT transcript expression was variable and correlated with ER status. Low ABAT transcript expression was associated with low ABAT protein expression and high beta-alanine concentration. In a large external microarray cohort, low ABAT expression shortened recurrence-free survival in breast cancer, ER+ breast cancer and ER- breast cancer.",

Using a double-blind placebo controlled design, 60 men and women (age ± SD = 70.7 ± 6.2 yrs) were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: 1) oral nutritional supplement (ONS; n = 20) (8 oz; 230 kcal; 12 g PRO; 31 g CHO; 6 g FAT), 2) ONS plus 800 mg beta-alanine (ONS800; n = 19), and 3) ONS plus 1200 mg beta-alanine (ONS1200; n = 21). Treatments were consumed twice per day for 12 weeks. At pre- and post-supplementation period, participants performed a discontinuous, submaximal cycle ergometry test to determine physical working capacity at fatigue threshold (PWCFT). Fat mass, total body and arm lean soft tissue mass (ALSTM) were measured with DEXA while muscle strength was assessed with handgrip dynamometry (GRIP) and 30-s sit-to-stand (STS) was used to measure lower body functionality. Muscle quality (MQ) was calculated with GRIPmax and DEXA derived ALSTM [GRIP (kg)·ALSTM (kg)(-1)]. Two-way analysis of variance was used to compare pre- to post-supplementation measures and group differences. There were 16 dropouts over the duration of the study. Final group sizes were ONS = 16 (m = 11, w = 5), ONS800 = 15 (m = 5, w = 10), and ONS1200 = 13 (m = 6, w = 7). No significant changes were observed for body composition or GRIP values pre to post. Significant increases in PW(CFT) were seen in ONS1200 (13.6%) and ONS800 (17.8%) pre- to post-supplementation (p < 0.05). These changes were significantly greater (p < 0.05) than the changes in ONS (-6.3%). ONS1200 and ONS had significant increases in STS (22.2 and 10.7%, respectively). While ONS significantly increased in STS, no differences (p > 0.05) in change scores were found between ONS and ONS800. ONS fortified with beta-alanine may improve physical working capacity, muscle quality and function in older men and women. These findings could have importance in the perception of frailty, and the maintenance of health and independent living in older adults.",

Also, it has been demonstrated that great deals of proton ions are produced in the skeletal muscles during exercise that result in acidosis, whereas β-alanine may reduce this effect. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the effects of alanine supplementation on VO(2) max, time to exhaustion and lactate concentrations in physical education male students. METHODS: Thirty-nine male physical education students volunteered for this study. Participants were supplemented orally for 6 week with either β-alanine (5*400 mg/d) or placebo (5*400 mg dextrose/d), randomly. VO(2) max and time to exhaustion (TTE) with a continuous graded exercise test (GXT) on an electronically braked cycle ergometer; and serum lactate and glucose concentrations were measured before and after supplementation. RESULTS: Supplementation with β-alanine showed a significant increase in VO(2) max (P<0.05) and a significant decrease in TTE and lactate concentrations (P<0.05). A significant elevation in lactate concentrations and a non significant increase in TTE were observed in placebo group. Plasma glucose concentrations did not change significantly in two groups after intervention. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that β-alanine supplementation can reduce lactate concentrations during exercise and thus can improve exercise performance in endurance athletes."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of β-alanine supplementation on high-intensity running performance and critical velocity (CV) and anaerobic running capacity (ARC). Fifty recreationally trained men were randomly assigned, in a double-blind fashion, to a β-alanine group (BA, 2 × 800 mg tablets, 3 times daily; CarnoSyn; n = 26) or placebo group (PL, 2 × 800 mg maltodextrin tablets, 3 times daily; n = 24). A graded exercise test (GXT) was performed to establish peak velocity (PV). Three high-speed runs to exhaustion were performed at 110, 100, and 90% of PV, with 15 minutes of rest between bouts. The distances achieved were plotted over the time to exhaustion (TTE). Linear regression was used to determine the slope (CV) and y-intercept (ARC) of these relationships to assess aerobic and anaerobic performances, respectively. There were no significant treatment effects (p > 0.05) on CV or ARC for either men or women. Additionally, no TTE effects were evident for bouts at 90-110%PV lasting 1.95-5.06 minutes. There seems to be no ergogenic effect of β-alanine supplementation on CV, ARC, or high-intensity running lasting approximately 2-5 minutes in either men or women in the current study.",

Compound 9m is a reversible and competitive antagonist with high binding affinity (IC(50) of 6.6 nM) and functional cAMP activity (IC(50) of 15.7 nM). It is selective for glucagon receptor relative to other family B GPCRs, showing IC(50) values of 1020 nM for GIPR, 9200 nM for PAC1, and >10000 nM for GLP-1R, VPAC1, and VPAC2. Compound 9m blunted glucagon-induced glucose elevation in hGCGR mice and rhesus monkeys. It also lowered ambient glucose levels in both acute and chronic mouse models: in hGCGR ob/ob mice it reduced glucose (AUC 0-6 h) by 32% and 39% at 3 and 10 mpk single doses, respectively. In hGCGR mice on a high fat diet, compound 9m at 3, and 10 mpk po in feed lowered blood glucose levels by 89% and 94% at day 10, respectively, relative to the difference between the vehicle control and lean hGCGR mice.

Subjective feelings of energy, fatigue, alertness, and focus were measured to examine associations between psychological factors and human performance. METHODS: Twelve recreationally-trained males participated in a 3-week investigation (mean +/- SD, age: 28 +/- 5 y, height: 178 +/- 9 cm, weight: 79.2 +/- 15.7 kg, VO2max: 45.7 +/- 7.6 ml/kg/min). Subjects reported to the human performance laboratory on three separate occasions. All participants completed a baseline/familiarization day of testing that included a maximal graded exercise test for the determination of aerobic capacity (VO2max), one-rep maximum (1-RM) for bench and leg press to determine 75% of 1-RM, choice reaction tests, and intermittent critical velocity familiarization. Choice reaction tests included the following: single-step audio and visual, one-tower stationary protocol, two-tower lateral protocol, three-tower multi-directional protocol, and three-tower multi-directional protocol with martial arts sticks. Subjects were randomly assigned to ingest either the supplement (SUP) or the placebo (PL) during Visit 2. Subjects were provided with the cross-over treatment on the last testing visit. Testing occurred 20 min following ingestion of both treatments. RESULTS: Significant (p < 0.05) main effects for the SUP were observed for leg press (SUP: 13 ± 6 reps, PL: 11 ± 3 reps), perceived energy (SUP: 3.4 ± 0.9, PL: 3.1 ± 0.8), alertness (SUP: 4.0 ± 0.7, PL: 3.5 ± 0.8), focus (SUP: 4.1 ± 0.6, PL: 3.5 ± 0.8), choice reaction audio single-step (SUP: 0.92 ± 0.10 s, PL: 0.97 ± 0.11 s), choice reaction multi-direction 15 s (SUP: 1.07 ± 0.12 s, PL: 1.13 ± 0.14 s), and multi-direction for 30 s (SUP: 1.10 ± 0.11 s, PL: 1.14 ± 0.13 s). CONCLUSIONS: Ingesting the SUP before exercise significantly improved agility choice reaction performance and lower body muscular endurance, while increasing perceived energy and reducing subjective fatigue. These findings suggest that the SUP may delay fatigue during strenuous exercise."

In particular, facile synthetic routes for these polymers and their corresponding polymeric nanomaterials would have a positive impact in the development of novel biomaterials and nanoparticles. However, progress has been hampered by the need to use complex protection-deprotection methods and toxic phase transfer catalysts. In this study, we report a facile, single-step approach for the synthesis of an N-alkylated amino acid as an AB-type functional monomer to generate a novel pseudo-poly(amino acid), without using the laborious multistep, protection-deprotection methods. This synthetic strategy is reproducible, easy to scale up, and does not produce toxic byproducts. In addition, the synthesized amino acid-based polymer is different from conventional linear polymers as the butyl pendants enhance its solubility in common organic solvents and facilitate the creation of hydrophobic nanocavities for the effective encapsulation of hydrophobic cargos upon nanoparticle formation. Within the nanoparticles, we have encapsulated a hydrophobic DiI dye and a therapeutic drug, Taxol. In addition, we have conjugated folic acid as a folate receptor-targeting ligand for the targeted delivery of the nanoparticles to cancer cells expressing the folate receptor. Cell cytotoxicity studies confirm the low toxicity of the polymeric nanoparticles, and drug-release experiments with the Taxol-encapsulated nanoparticles only exhibit cytotoxicity upon internalization into cancer cells expressing the folate receptor. Taken together, these results suggested that our synthetic strategy can be useful for the one-step synthesis of amino acid-based small molecules, biopolymers, and theranostic polymeric nanoagents for the targeted detection and treatment of cancer.",

      "abstract": "5-Fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (floxuridine, 5-FdUrd) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) are widely used for the treatment of colorectal cancers. The mechanisms of action of 5-FdUrd and 5-FU, as well as the biochemical pathway responsible for their metabolism, are well understood. Identification of every metabolite and achieving mass balance by conventional UV absorption-based HPLC analysis are not feasible because the metabolites beyond 5-FU in the 5-FdUrd metabolic pathway are undetectable by UV light. We therefore established a mass spectrometry method, designed for fast and convenient analysis, for simultaneously measuring 5-FdUrd, 5-FU, and their metabolites. Linearity, precision and accuracy were validated in the concentration ranges studied for each compound. Hydrolysis studies of 5-FdUrd and amino acid mono ester prodrugs of 5-FdUrd in Capan-2 cell homogenates were carried out and the achievement of mass balance was established with this method (recovery of 5'-O-l-leucyl-FdUrd was 96.6-108.2% and that of 5-FdUrd was 79.4-117.4%). This simple LC-MS method achieves reliable quantitation and mass balance of 5-FdUrd, 5-FU, and their metabolites and can be effectively utilized for further kinetic studies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The beta-amino acid, taurine, is a nutritional requirement in some species. In these species, the depletion of intracellular stores of taurine leads to the development of severe organ dysfunction. The basis underlying these defects is poorly understood, although there is some suggestion that oxidative stress may contribute to the abnormalities. Recent studies indicate that taurine is required for normal mitochondrial protein synthesis and normal electron transport chain activity; it is known that defects in these events can lead to severe mitochondrial oxidative stress. The present study examines the effect of taurine deficiency on the first step of mitochondrial protein synthesis regulation by taurine, namely, the formation of taurinomethyluridine containing tRNA. METHODS: Isolated rat cardiomyocytes were rendered taurine deficient by incubation with medium containing the taurine transport inhibitor, beta-alanine. The time course of cellular and mitochondrial taurine depletion was measured. The primer extension method was employed to evaluate the effect of beta-alanine treatment on taurinomethyluridine content of tRNALeu. The protein levels of ND6 were also determined by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: beta-alanine caused a time-dependent decrease in cellular taurine content, which were reduced in half after 48 hrs of incubation. The amount of taurine in the mitochondria was considerably less than that in the cytosol and was unaffected by beta-alanine treatment. Approximately 70% of the tRNALeu in the untreated cell lacked taurinomethyluridine and these levels were unchanged following beta-alanine treatment. Protein content of ND6, however, was significantly reduced after 48 hours incubation with beta-alanine. CONCLUSIONS: The taurine levels of the cytosol and the mitochondria are not directly coupled. The beta-alanine-mediated reduction in taurine levels is too small to affect taurinomethyluridine levels. Nonetheless, it interferes with mitochondrial protein synthesis, as exemplified by a decrease in ND6 protein content. Thus, beta-alanine does not cause alterations in mitochondrial protein synthesis through the lowering of taurine levels.",

This study was the first to examine the effects of betaA supplementation on the onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA) during incremental treadmill running. METHODS: Seventeen recreationally-active men (mean +/- SE 24.9 +/- 4.7 yrs, 180.6 +/- 8.9 cm, 79.25 +/- 9.0 kg) participated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pre/post test 2-treatment experimental design. Subjects participated in two incremental treadmill tests before and after 28 days of supplementation with either betaA (6.0 g.d-1)(betaA, n = 8) or an equivalent dose of Maltodextrin as the Placebo (PL, n = 9). Heart rate, percent heart rate maximum (%HRmax), %VO2max@OBLA (4.0 mmol.L-1 blood lactate concentration) and VO2max (L.min-1) were determined for each treadmill test. Friedman test was used to determine within group differences; and Mann-Whitney was used to determine between group differences for pre and post values (p < 0.05). RESULTS: The betaA group experienced a significant rightward shift in HR@OBLA beats.min-1 (p < 0.01) pre/post (161.6 +/- 19.2 to 173.6 +/- 9.9) but remained unchanged in the PL group (166.8 +/- 15.8 to 169.6 +/- 16.1). The %HRmax@OBLA increased (p < 0.05) pre/post in the betaA group (83.0% +/- 9.7 to 88.6% +/- 3.7) versus no change in the PL group (86.3 +/- % 4.8 to 87.9% +/- 7.2). The %VO2max@OBLA increased (p < 0.05) in the betaA group pre/post (69.1 +/- 11.0 to 75.6 +/- 10.7) but remained unchanged in the PL group (73.3 +/- 7.3 to 74.3 +/- 7.3). VO2max (L.min-1) decreased (p < 0.01) in the betaA group pre/post (4.57 +/- 0.8 to 4.31 +/- 0.8) versus no change in the PL group (4.04 +/- 0.7 to 4.18 +/- 0.8). Body mass kg increased (p < 0.05) in the betaA group pre/post (77.9 +/- 9.0 to 78.3 +/- 9.3) while the PL group was unchanged (80.6 +/- 9.1 to 80.4 +/- 9.0). CONCLUSIONS: betaA supplementation for 28 days enhanced sub-maximal endurance performance by delaying OBLA. However, betaA supplemented individuals had a reduced aerobic capacity as evidenced by the decrease in VO2max values post supplementation."

These facts aroused our interest in new capabilities of taurine and beta-alanine. Thus, to investigate the effects of chronic ingestion of taurine- (22.5 mmol/kg diet) supplemented diet and beta-alanine- (22.5 mmol/kg diet) supplemented diet under acute stressful conditions, behavioral changes and brain metabolites were compared with mice fed a control diet. In the open field test, no significant difference was observed in locomotor activity among groups. In the elevated plus-maze test, however, significant increases in the percentage of time spent and entries in the open arms were observed in the beta-alanine-supplemented diet fed group compared to both controls and animals fed with taurine-supplemented diet. Moreover, a significant decrease in the duration of immobility was observed in the taurine-supplemented diet group in the forced swimming test compared to both controls and animals fed with beta-alanine-supplemented diet. Taurine-supplemented diet increased taurine and L: -arginine concentrations in the hypothalamus. In contrast, beta-alanine-supplemented diet decreased the concentration of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, a major metabolite of serotonin, in the hypothalamus. Beta-alanine-supplemented diet also increased carnosine (beta-alanyl-L: -histidine) concentration in the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor concentration in the hippocampus. These results suggested that taurine-supplemented diet had an antidepressant-like effect and beta-alanine-supplemented diet had an anxiolytic-like effect.",

      "abstract": "High-intensity exercise results in reduced substrate levels and accumulation of metabolites in the skeletal muscle. The accumulation of these metabolites (e.g. ADP, Pi and H(+)) can have deleterious effects on skeletal muscle function and force generation, thus contributing to fatigue. Clearly this is a challenge to sport and exercise performance and, as such, any intervention capable of reducing the negative impact of these metabolites would be of use. Carnosine (beta-alanyl-L-histidine) is a cytoplasmic dipeptide found in high concentrations in the skeletal muscle of both vertebrates and non-vertebrates and is formed by bonding histidine and beta-alanine in a reaction catalysed by carnosine synthase. Due to the pKa of its imidazole ring (6.83) and its location within skeletal muscle, carnosine has a key role to play in intracellular pH buffering over the physiological pH range, although other physiological roles for carnosine have also been suggested. The concentration of histidine in muscle and plasma is high relative to its K (m) with muscle carnosine synthase, whereas beta-alanine exists in low concentration in muscle and has a higher K (m) with muscle carnosine synthase, which indicates that it is the availability of beta-alanine that is limiting to the synthesis of carnosine in skeletal muscle. Thus, the elevation of muscle carnosine concentrations through the dietary intake of carnosine, or chemically related dipeptides that release beta-alanine on absorption, or supplementation with beta-alanine directly could provide a method of increasing intracellular buffering capacity during exercise, which could provide a means of increasing high-intensity exercise capacity and performance. This paper reviews the available evidence relating to the effects of beta-alanine supplementation on muscle carnosine synthesis and the subsequent effects on exercise performance. In addition, the effects of training, with or without beta-alanine supplementation, on muscle carnosine concentrations are also reviewed.",

      "abstract": "Ti(III) reduction of perchlorate might be a useful method for the treatment of highly perchlorate-contaminated water. Though the reaction rate was usually low, we observed that beta-alanine (HOOCCH(2)CH(2)NH(2)) could significantly promote the reaction. A complete (>99.9%) perchlorate removal was obtained in a solution containing [ClO(4)(-)]=1.0mM, [Ti(III)]=40 mM, and [beta-alanine]=120 mM after 2.5h of reaction under 50 degrees C. The effects of both pH and complex formation on the reaction were then studied. The results showed that without beta-alanine the optimal pH was 2.3. When pH increased from 1.6 to 2.3, the reduction rate increased remarkably. In the pH range >2.3, however, the reduction was significantly inhibited, attributed to the formation of Ti(III) precipitate. The presence of beta-alanine at a molar ratio of [beta-alanine]:[Ti(III)]=3:1 significantly increased the reduction rate of perchlorate even at near neutral pH. This is because beta-alanine formed complexes with Ti(III), which greatly improved the total soluble [Ti(III)] in the pH range between 3.5 and 6. The findings may lead to the development of rapid treatment methods for intermittent and small stream of highly perchlorate-contaminated water, which are resulted from the manufacturing, storage, handling, use and/or disposal of large quantities of perchlorate salts.",

Supplementing beta-alanine has been shown to significantly increase skeletal muscle carnosine. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine the effects of ninety days of beta-alanine supplementation on the physical working capacity at the fatigue threshold (PWCFT) in elderly men and women. METHODS: Using a double-blind placebo controlled design, twenty-six men (n = 9) and women (n = 17) (age +/- SD = 72.8 +/- 11.1 yrs) were randomly assigned to either beta-alanine (BA: 800 mg x 3 per day; n = 12; CarnoSyntrade mark) or Placebo (PL; n = 14) group. Before (pre) and after (post) the supplementation period, participants performed a discontinuous cycle ergometry test to determine the PWCFT. RESULTS: Significant increases in PWCFT (28.6%) from pre- to post-supplementation were found for the BA treatment group (p < 0.05), but no change was observed with PL treatment. These findings suggest that ninety days of BA supplementation may increase physical working capacity by delaying the onset of neuromuscular fatigue in elderly men and women. CONCLUSION: We suggest that BA supplementation, by improving intracellular pH control, improves muscle endurance in the elderly. This, we believe, could have importance in the prevention of falls, and the maintenance of health and independent living in elderly men and women."

Two groups of old (22 mo) rats were treated with beta-alanine (3%, w/v; in drinking water), a taurine depleting agent, or taurine (2% w/v; in drinking water) for 6 wk. Significant decreases were observed in taurine contents of hearts in old rats as compared to young (5 mo) rats. We found that MDA and DC levels and AA- and NADPH-induced lipid peroxidation increased, but non-enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidants did not alter in heart homogenates of aged rats. beta-Alanine administration resulted in significant decreases in heart taurine levels of old rats. This treatment did not cause further increases in MDA or DC levels or changes in antioxidants. However, AA- and NADPH-induced lipid peroxidation was higher than that of old rats. Taurine treatment caused significant increases in heart taurine levels of old rats. This treatment was found to decrease endogenous MDA and DC levels without affecting the antioxidant system in the heart homogenates of aged rats. AA- and NADPH-induced lipid peroxidation was also reduced in old rats when given taurine, although not statistically significantly. Our results indicate that the changes in heart taurine levels may influence the susceptibility of heart tissue to lipid peroxidation in aged rats and that taurine supplementation has protective effects on age-dependent oxidative stress in heart tissue.",

The ingestion of beta-alanine, the rate-limiting precursor of carnosine, has been shown to elevate the muscle carnosine content. We aimed to investigate, using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (proton MRS), whether oral supplementation with beta-alanine during 4 wk would elevate the calf muscle carnosine content and affect exercise performance in 400-m sprint-trained competitive athletes. Fifteen male athletes participated in a placebo-controlled, double-blind study and were supplemented orally for 4 wk with either 4.8 g/day beta-alanine or placebo. Muscle carnosine concentration was quantified in soleus and gastrocnemius by proton MRS. Performance was evaluated by isokinetic testing during five bouts of 30 maximal voluntary knee extensions, by endurance during isometric contraction at 45% maximal voluntary contraction, and by the indoor 400-m running time. beta-Alanine supplementation significantly increased the carnosine content in both the soleus (+47%) and gastrocnemius (+37%). In placebo, carnosine remained stable in soleus, while a small and significant increase of +16% occurred in gastrocnemius. Dynamic knee extension torque during the fourth and fifth bout was significantly improved with beta-alanine but not with placebo. Isometric endurance and 400-m race time were not affected by treatment. In conclusion, 1) proton MRS can be used to noninvasively quantify human muscle carnosine content; 2) muscle carnosine is increased by oral beta-alanine supplementation in sprint-trained athletes; 3) carnosine loading slightly but significantly attenuated fatigue in repeated bouts of exhaustive dynamic contractions; and 4) the increase in muscle carnosine did not improve isometric endurance or 400-m race time.",

Plasma levels of tegafur, 5-FU, CDHP, potassium oxonate, FUH(2) and FBAL were measured prior to and at 1, 2, 4, 6 and 10 h after oral administration of 40 mg/m(2) S-1. The total amounts of 5-FU, FUH(2) and FBAL excreted into urine during the 24-h period after S-1 administration were also measured. Total gastrectomy significantly increased the maximum concentration and the area under the curve until 10 h after administration (AUC(1-10h)) of plasma 5-FU. The plasma AUC(1-10h) of CDHP was significantly higher than the preoperative value. In terms of clinical efficacy, the higher AUC(1-10h) of 5-FU after total gastrectomy may be beneficial to S-1 administered as adjuvant chemotherapy, and might be caused by the higher postoperative AUC(1-10h) of CDHP relative to preoperative values. However, the dose of S-1 for patients who have undergone total gastrectomy might be diminished to avoid severe adverse events and to continue the treatment for a long period.",

This treatment caused significant decreases in taurine levels of liver (86%), brain (36%) and heart (15%). We found that endogenous and ascorbic acid-, NADPH- and cumene hydroperoxide-induced malondialdehyde (MDA) levels did not change in the liver, brain and heart homogenates following beta-alanine treatment. Also, H(2)O(2)-induced MDA levels remained unchanged in erythrocytes. In addition, we did not observe any changes in levels of MDA, diene conjugates, glutathione, alpha-tocopherol, ascorbic acid and the activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione transferase in the liver. According to this, buffering or sequestering capacity of tissues to exogenous stimuli was not influenced by reduced taurine levels in tissues of rats.",

We herein report the case of a 70-year-old man with 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity, in whom a high serum level of alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL) was observed. The patient, who had unresectable colon cancer metastases to the liver and lung, was referred to us for chemotherapy from an affiliated hospital; he had no cardiac history. After admission, the patient received a continuous intravenous infusion of 5-FU (1000 mg/day), during which precordial pain with right bundle branch block occurred concomitantly with a high serum FBAL concentration of 1955 ng/ml. Both the precordial pain and the electrocardiographic changes disappeared spontaneously after the discontinuation of 5-FU. As the precordial pain in this patient was considered to have been due to 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity, the administration of 5-FU was abandoned. Instead, oral administration of S-1 (a derivative of 5-FU), at 200 mg/day twice a week, was instituted, because S-1 has a strong inhibitory effect on dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the degradative of 5-FU into FBAL. The serum FBAL concentration subsequently decreased to 352 ng/ml, the same as the value measured on the first day of S-1 administration. Thereafter, no cardiac symptoms were observed. The patient achieved a partial response 6 months after the initiation of the S-1 treatment. The experience of this case, together with a review of the literature, suggests that FBAL is related to 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity. S-1 may be administered safely to patients with 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity.",

      "abstract": "We isolated a cDNA encoding an orphan G protein-coupled receptor, TGR7, which has been recently reported to correspond to MrgD. To search for ligands for TGR7, we screened a series of small molecule compounds by detecting the Ca2+ influx in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing TGR7. Through this screening, we found that beta-alanine at micromolar doses specifically evoked Ca2+ influx in cells expressing human, rat, or mouse TGR7. A structural analogue, gamma-aminobutyric acid, weakly stimulated cells expressing human or rat TGR7, but another analogue, glycine, did not. In addition, beta-alanine decreased forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in cells expressing TGR7, suggesting that TGR7 couples with G proteins Gq and Gi. In guanosine 5'-O-3-thiotriphosphate binding assays conducted using a membrane fraction of cells expressing TGR7, beta-alanine specifically increased the binding of guanosine 5'-O-3-thiotriphosphate. When a fusion protein composed of TGR7 and green fluorescent protein was expressed in cells, it localized at the plasma membrane but internalized into the cytoplasm after treatment with beta-alanine. In addition, we found that beta-[3H]alanine more efficiently bound to TGR7-expressing cells than to control cells. From these results, we concluded that TGR7 functioned as a specific membrane receptor for beta-alanine. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that TGR7 mRNA was predominantly expressed in the dorsal root ganglia in rats. By in situ hybridization and immunostaining, we confirmed that TGR7 mRNA was co-expressed in the small diameter neurons with P2X3 and VR1, both in rat and monkey dorsal root ganglia. Our results suggest that TGR7 participates in the modulation of neuropathic pain.",

After 3 weeks, diabetes was induced by streptozotocin injection (50 mg/kg body-weight). Pancreatic morphology was observed by transmission electron microscopy. The pancreatic beta-cell of the non-diabetic (CO) group had the many secretory granules, rough endoplasmic reticulum and rod shaped mitochondria. However, the beta-cells of non taurine-supplemented diabetic (EO) group were severely damaged, showing depleted secretory granules. In the 1% taurine-supplemented diabetic group, the beta-cells were less damaged compared to the EO group and had some apparently normal secretory granules, but most of rough endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria was destroyed. The beta-cell of 2% taurine-supplemented diabetic group had swollen rough endoplasmic reticulum, round-shaped mitochondria and some apparently normal secretory granules. The beta-cell of 3% taurine-supplemented diabetic group was little different from that of non-diabetic group. The pancreatic beta-cell of taurine-depleted diabetic group was not destroyed but had many small secretory granules which appeared immature. This was reflected in the blood glucose concentrations of this group. Therefore, taurine may prevent insulin-dependent diabetes by protection of the pancreatic beta-cell and may also preserve normal secretory granules. From these results, taurine supplementation may be recommended for prevention and treatment of diabetes.",

Its potential role in plant tolerance to salinity and hypoxia makes its synthetic pathway an interesting target for metabolic engineering. In the Plumbaginaceae, beta-Ala betaine is synthesized by S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent N-methylation of beta-Ala via N-methyl beta-Ala and N,N-dimethyl beta-Ala. It was not known how many N-methyltransferases (NMTases) participate in the three N-methylations of beta-Ala. An NMTase was purified about 1,890-fold, from Limonium latifolium leaves, using a protocol consisting of polyethylene glycol precipitation, heat treatment, anion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration, native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and two substrate affinity chromatography steps. The purified NMTase was trifunctional, methylating beta-Ala, N-methyl beta-Ala, and N,N-dimethyl beta-Ala. Gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses indicated that the native NMTase is a dimer of 43-kD subunits. The NMTase had an apparent K(m) of 45 microM S-adenosyl-l-methionine and substrate inhibition was observed above 200 microM. The apparent K(m) values for the methyl acceptor substrates were 5.3, 5.7, and 5.9 mM for beta-Ala, N-methyl beta-Ala, and N,N-dimethyl beta-Ala, respectively. The NMTase had an isoelectric point of 5.15 and was reversibly inhibited by the thiol reagent p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid.",

This resulted in significant hepatic steatosis and lipid peroxidation. Beta-alanine, when co-administered with alcohol, seemed to increase hepatic steatosis, as assessed histologically, but decreased triglyceride levels as measured biochemically. In addition, beta-alanine and especially alcohol co-administered with beta-alanine, significantly increased homocysteine and cysteine excretion into urine throughout the 28-day period of ethanol administration. Serum homocysteine levels were significantly higher in alcohol- and alcohol plus beta-alanine-treated animals compared to pair-fed control animals. Alcohol did not affect the urinary excretion of taurine, except after 21 days, when levels were reduced. Levels of liver taurine were markedly depleted in animals receiving alcohol and particularly alcohol plus beta-alanine, compared to pair-fed controls. Liver and serum taurine levels were also markedly depleted in animals receiving beta-alanine and alcohol plus beta-alanine, compared to non-beta-alanine-treated animals. There was evidence of slight cholestasis in animals treated with alcohol and more so with alcohol plus beta-alanine, as indicated by raised serum alkaline phosphatase and bile acids. These in vivo findings demonstrate for the first time that animals treated with beta-alanine may be more susceptible to ethanol-induced hepatic dysfunction, possibly as a result of taurine depletion.",

      "abstract": "We have shown previously that (R)-5-fluoro-5,6-dihydrouracil (FUraH(2)) attenuates the antitumor activity of 5-fluorouracil (FUra) in rats bearing advanced colorectal carcinoma. Presently, we found that alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL), the predominant catabolite of FUra that is formed rapidly via FUraH(2), also decreased the antitumor activity and potentiated the toxicity of FUra. In rats treated with Eniluracil (5-ethynyluracil, GW776), excess FBAL, in a 9:1 ratio to FUra, produced similar effects when administered 1 hr before, simultaneously with, or 2 hr after FUra. FBAL also decreased the antitumor activity of FUra in Eniluracil-treated mice bearing MOPC-315 myeloma at a 9:1 ratio with FUra, but not at a 2:1 ratio. FBAL did not affect the antitumor activity of FUra in mice bearing Colon 38 tumors. We also evaluated the effect of thymidylate synthase (TS) and thymidine kinase (TK) from tumor extracts after FUra +/- Eniluracil +/- FBAL treatment. The activity of TK was similar among the three groups at both 18 and 120 hr. There was also no difference in TS inhibition ( approximately 35%) at 18 hr. However, significantly more TS inhibition was observed in the Eniluracil/FUra group than in the FUra-alone group at 120 hr. FBAL did not alter the effect of Eniluracil/FUra in TS inhibition. Neither FUraH(2) nor FBAL affected the IC(50) of FUra in culture. Thus, the effect of FBAL did not result from direct competition with FUra uptake or immediate anabolism. Either another downstream catabolite that is not formed in cell culture is the active agent, or the effect requires the complexity of a living organism or an established tumor.",

      "abstract": "Prophylactic effects of N-benzoyl-beta-alanine (betamipron, BP), one of a series of N-acyl amino acids, were examined against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. Male Wistar rats were injected i.p. with 6 mg/kg of cisplatin combined with an i.p. BP dose given at various times and various doses. Rats were sacrificed 5 days after cisplatin injection to weigh the kidney and liver, and to determine blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (serum Cr) levels. Preliminary results suggest that treatment with BP is an effective means of protection against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. Combination with BP reduced the weight loss following treatment with cisplatin. The ratios of the kidney and liver weights to the body weight in the animals treated with cisplatin followed later with BP are significantly different (p < 0.05) from those in the animals that received only cisplatin. The BUN and serum Cr levels in the animals treated with cisplatin followed from -1 to 4 hr, and from -4 to 4 hr later with 250 mg/kg BP dose and followed 1 hr later with from 250 to 1000 mg/kg, and from 250 to 2000 mg/kg BP doses differed significantly (p < 0.05) from those in the animals that received only cisplatin. Histological analysis of the kidneys confirmed the protective effect of BP.",
