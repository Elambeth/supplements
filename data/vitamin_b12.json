      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Effective and timely treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency in childhood is crucial because it can lead to serious issues, including delayed growth and neuromotor development. Available treatment options include oral, intramuscular, and sublingual administration. AIM: This study investigated the efficacy of a new dosing protocol for sublingual methylcobalamin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 312 patients with vitamin B12 deficiency (serum level < 250 ng/L) were divided into two groups based on their treatment type: intramuscular cyanocobalamin (Group 1) and sublingual methylcobalamin (Group 2). Group 1 included 29 (9.3%) patients, and Group 2 included 283 (90.7%) patients, with 56 (18%) patients in Group 2 undergoing treatment for childhood cancer. The sublingual methylcobalamin protocol consisted of 1 puff (500 μg) daily for children under 8 years of age and 2 puffs (1000 μg) daily for those 8 years and older, administered for 1.5 months and then three times weekly for an additional 1.5 months. RESULTS: The mean ages in Groups 1 and 2 were 10.07 ± 6.05 years (range, 1-17 years) and 7.43 ± 5.86 years (range, 0.1-17 years), respectively. The female/male ratio was 19/10 in Group 1 and 145/138 in Group 2. The most common diagnoses were anemia (72, 22.9%), cancer (56, 18.0%), and hemangioma (40, 12.7%). The median serum levels of vitamin B12 in Group 1 were 177 ng/L before treatment, 447 ng/L after 1.5 months, and 321.5 ng/L after 3 months. In Group 2, the levels were 172 ng/L before treatment, 438 ng/L after 1.5 months, and 360 ng/L after 3 months. There were no significant between-group differences. Both groups showed a statistically significant increase in levels above 300 ng/L. DISCUSSION: Sublingual methylcobalamin, a noninvasive treatment option, was as effective as intramuscular cyanocobalamin. This study is to compare the standard intramuscular protocol with a new dosing regimen for sublingual methylcobalamin. This study showed that it is also useful for children to hold the spray in their mouths for 1 min and avoid food intake for the next 15 min."

      "abstract": "Vitamin B12 is the common name for a group of cobalamins, which are cobalt corrines. Cobalamins are water-soluble B vitamins. Vitamin B12, as a coenzyme of various enzymes, is an essential component of many key metabolic processes in the body. Vitamin B12 deficiency causes dysfunction of various organs and systems in the body, including the central nervous system. Humans, like other animals, are unable to synthesize cobalamin. This vitamin must be supplied with a balanced diet. The only valuable dietary sources of cobalamin are foods of animal origin, especially offal (e.g., liver). Vegan and vegetarian diets are deficient in vitamin B12. People who follow this nutritional model require systematic cobalamin supplementation, usually in oral form. Other causes of cobalamin deficiency are various pathogenetic processes, in the course of which any of the stages of the complicated process of absorption of this vitamin from the gastrointestinal tract are impaired. Disorders of intestinal absorption of vitamin B12 require systematic supplementation of cobalamin parenterally (usually by intramuscular or subcutaneous injections) for the rest of life. Supplementary therapy with vitamin B12 may cause various adverse reactions, among which hypersensitivity reactions of various spectrums and intensity of symptoms are possible. According to available data, hypersensitivity to cobalamin is more likely after intramuscular or subcutaneous administration than in oral form. It also seems that long-term administration of cobalamin predisposes to allergy to vitamin B12, regardless of its chemical form. Although hypersensitivity to cobalamin is rather rare, it can also be of great clinical importance. This is due to the fact that vitamin B12 deficiency affects a significant part of the population, especially the elderly and those with chronic diseases that impair its absorption. In addition, supplementary therapy with cobalamin is long-term (usually lifelong) and there is no alternative form of treatment. For these reasons, solutions are sought that will allow for the safe continuation of treatment supplementing cobalamin deficiency. Various cyanocobalamin desensitization protocols are proposed, differing in duration, the dynamics of gradual dose increase, or the method of injection (intramuscular or subcutaneous). An analysis of available data in this field suggests that desensitization with cyanocobalamin seems to be an effective way to obtain tolerance to vitamin B12, allowing for long-term supplementation of this vitamin regardless of the chemical form, dose size, frequency, or route of administration."

      "abstract": "A 37-year-old male presented with complaints of fatigue, weight loss, and decreased appetite. Laboratory examinations revealed hemolytic anemia, an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, and marked schistocytosis. His other laboratory hematological findings included nucleated red blood cells with abnormal morphologies in the peripheral blood, as well as a small peak that was indicative of schistocytes on a red blood cell histogram. A bone marrow examination demonstrated megaloblastic changes; therefore, a preliminary diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency was made. Intramuscular vitamin B12 injections were started, and it was later reported that the patient's serum vitamin B12 level was below the reference range. Hence, the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency was confirmed. Thereafter, the hemolysis and anemia improved within five weeks. It has been reported that megaloblastic anemia accompanied by schistocytosis demonstrates similar laboratory hematological findings to thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and is therefore called pseudo-TMA. In such cases, it is important to identify and rule out other concomitant abnormalities based on laboratory findings, to make a prompt and accurate diagnosis and choose an appropriate treatment strategy."

      "abstract": "Introduction Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) imposes a considerable impact on day-to-day functioning. Many people experience insufficient symptom relief even after taking the optimum dose of OCD medications. Reduced levels of folic acid and vitamin B₁₂, along with elevated homocysteine (HCY), have been suggested as possible factors in the persistence of obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms. This study investigated how supplementation of vitamin B₁₂, folic acid, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) affects OC symptoms and related biochemical markers. Methods A comparative study enrolled 72 OCD patients. For eight weeks, the conventional treatment group received SSRIs or other anti-obsessive medication. In contrast, the nutrient-supplemented group received supplements of vitamin B₁₂, folic acid, and SSRIs. Micronutrients HCY, folic acid, and vitamin B₁₂ were measured at baseline and after eight weeks. Besides, the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) was applied to assess the severity of OCD symptoms at the baseline, four-week, and eight-week visits. Results Group A (conventional treatment with nutrient supplement) showed significant improvements in vitamin B₁₂, blood folic acid, and reductions in HCY levels compared to Group B (conventional treatment). However, no substantial differences in insight levels were observed between the groups. Both groups exhibited decreased Y-BOCS scores, indicating a reduction in OCD symptoms; however, the improvements in Group A (conventional treatment + nutrient supplement) were statistically significant. Conclusions When taken with SSRIs, vitamin B₁₂and folic acid supplements seem to improve OCD patients' clinical results. These results imply that this supplementation could be a useful therapeutic adjunct."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a serious health condition affecting people worldwide with a high prevalence rate. DM is classified according to its aetiology into type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); several risk factors contribute to the development of T2DM, such as age, genetic predisposition and obesity. Metformin is a proven drug of choice, and it is used as a first-line treatment for patients with T2DM to improve their glycaemic levels. Vitamin B12 is an important water-soluble vitamin, and its deficiency can lead to megaloblastic anaemia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted on patients with T2DM in a Sedi Hussein diabetic polyclinic in Benghazi, Libya. The total sample was 381 patients: T1DM 15 (n), and T2DM 366 (n). T1DM was excluded from our results. Patients with T2DM were divided into two groups: the control group (not on metformin) consisted of 71 patients, and the group that received metformin (M group) consisted of 295 patients. AIMS OF THE STUDY: To assess serum vitamin B12 levels in patients with T2DM and evaluate the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency among those receiving metformin treatment. RESULTS: The M group significantly decreased vitamin B12 serum levels by 443.56 mg/mL versus the control group of 541.33 pg/mL (p = 0.003). The prevalence of patients with vitamin B12 deficiency under the metformin treatment was 23.84%. There was no significant difference in correlation between serum vitamin B12 levels and both doses of metformin and the duration of diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSION: Vitamin B12 was significantly decreased in patients with T2DM receiving metformin.",

      "abstract": "The seaweeds Ulva fenestrata and Palmaria palmata are promising food items; however, it remains unclear whether both contain true vitamin B12 and how post-harvest processing, storage, and protein extraction affect this vitamin. UHPLC-UV-MS/MS analysis revealed that untreated Ulva contained 681 ± 37 ng B12/g dry weight (dw) - 22 times more than Palmaria. Biomass soaking (16 °C, 3 min) in freshwater did not affect B12 content, but blanching (60 °C, 3 min) reduced its content in Ulva by 45 % (dw basis) and 61 % (protein content basis). Oven-drying and freeze-drying equally preserved B12; both techniques maintained B12 content during room-temperature dark storage for 4.8 months. Protein extraction via a new method (Trigo et al., 2025) resulted in a dried ingredient containing 60 % more B12 than untreated Ulva, and 29 times more than red meat on a moisture-equivalent basis. All Ulva samples - including the protein ingredient - qualified for the EU nutritional claim \"High in Vitamin B12\"."

      "abstract": "Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) plays a crucial role in neurodevelopment, particularly during pregnancy and early childhood. It is essential for DNA synthesis, red blood cell formation, and nervous system function. Maternal B12 levels are particularly important, as they influence fetal brain development. Inadequate maternal intake during pregnancy may lead to altered neurodevelopmental trajectories and increase the risk of ASD. Postnatally, insufficient dietary cobalamin in infants and young children could further contribute to cognitive and behavioral impairments. One potential mechanism linking low B12 levels to ASD involves its role in the gut microbiota balance. Dysbiosis, commonly observed in individuals with ASD, is associated with increased gut permeability, low-grade inflammation, and disruptions in the gut-brain axis, all of which may contribute to ASD symptoms. Additionally, B12 is essential for neurotransmitter metabolism, particularly in the synthesis of serotonin and dopamine, which regulate mood, cognition, and behavior. Cobalamin also plays a key role in neuronal myelination, which ensures efficient signal transmission in the nervous system. Disruptions in these processes could underlie some of the cognitive and behavioral features associated with ASD. Despite growing evidence, the link between B12 and ASD remains inconclusive due to inconsistent findings across studies. Research suggests that B12 levels may serve as a potential biomarker for disease progression and treatment response. However, many studies rely on single-time-point measurements, failing to account for individual variability, genetic predispositions, dietary intake, and environmental factors, all of which can influence B12 levels and ASD risk. Further longitudinal studies are needed to clarify this relationship.",

In the current study, we aimed to screen candidate small molecule target oncogenic USPs in osteosarcoma. Initially, analysis of public datasets revealed that USP3 is significantly upregulated in osteosarcoma tissues. Functional studies further demonstrated that USP3 promotes osteosarcoma cell proliferation and tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. Through structure-based virtual screening, we identified Vitamin B12 as a potential USP3 inhibitor. Biochemical assays confirmed that Vitamin B12 effectively suppresses USP3 activity at a level comparable to PR619, a broad-spectrum deubiquitinase inhibitor. Furthermore, Vitamin B12 mitigates the oncogenic effects of USP3 in osteosarcoma by inhibiting its deubiquitinase activity. In conclusion, our findings offer new insights into the role of USP3 in osteosarcoma and underscore the potential of Vitamin B12 as a promising therapeutic agent.",

CASE PRESENTATION: This case describes a 40-year-old Iranian woman with a decade-long history of nonspecific symptoms, including fatigue, widespread musculoskeletal pain, paresthesia, cognitive disturbances, and optic neuritis; misattributed to conditions such as fibromyalgia, hypothyroidism, and autoimmune diseases. Despite annual monitoring for normocytic anemia, her critically low vitamin B12 levels (< 150 pg/mL) and a diagnosis of pernicious anemia were identified only after persistent symptoms prompted further evaluation, revealing atrophic gastritis as the underlying cause. Neurologic improvement with parenteral B12 therapy, alongside management of fibromyalgia, emphasizes the importance of considering vitamin B12 deficiency even in the absence of classic hematologic findings. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the diagnostic challenges of pernicious anemia, where nonspecific symptoms and overlapping comorbidities obscure diagnosis, underscoring the need for a systematic, multidisciplinary approach and timely recognition of vitamin B12 deficiency to prevent irreversible complications.",

      "abstract": "Successful cell migration followed by cell adhesion and tissue remodeling is required for organogenesis in a number of tissues, many of which are susceptible to gene-environment interactions resulting in congenital anomalies. In C. elegans embryogenesis, one such event is the closure of the ventral cleft, an essential first step in morphogenesis; this process depends on ephrin signaling, but no single gene mutation is fully penetrant embryonic lethal, likely due to redundancy with semaphorin and Robo signaling. We exposed hermaphrodites mutant for vab-1, the C. elegans ephrin receptor, to various environmental conditions and found vitamin B12 supplementation could partially rescue the embryonic lethality of multiple alleles improving survival by 58%. Vitamin B12 improved the frequency of ventral cleft closure by promoting cell positions more similar to wildtype and increasing cell migration. We found vitamin B12 partially rescued the embryonic lethality of other ephrin pathway mutants as well as semaphorin and robo mutants, but not mutants with ventral cleft defects due to cell adhesion or cell fate defects. We found rescue by vitamin B12 depends on its functions in both mitochondrial propionic acid breakdown and the one-carbon cycle, and antioxidant treatment can also partially rescue ephrin pathway mutants. These results are distinct from the larval response to vitamin B12, which depends only on the one-carbon cycle, emphasizing the unique metabolism of embryos and particularly the metabolic needs of migrating cells. Overall, our findings highlight the C. elegans embryo as a model system to investigate gene-environment interactions and developmental metabolism."

Identifying this deficiency as a possible cause of hemolysis is essential to prevent misdiagnosis, especially when distinguishing it from thrombotic microangiopathy. We present a case involving a 60-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes who came in with symptoms of generalized weakness, dizziness, nausea, and abdominal pain. Laboratory tests showed pancytopenia, macrocytosis, and signs of hemolysis. Further investigation confirmed a severe vitamin B12 deficiency linked to pernicious anemia. After starting weekly intramuscular cyanocobalamin injections for the first month and then switching to monthly injections for four months post-discharge, her blood parameters showed significant improvement. This underlines the vital role of timely diagnosis and following established treatment protocols. This case emphasizes the importance of considering vitamin B12 deficiency as a reversible cause of hemolysis.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of homocysteine, vitamin B12, folic acid, and vitamin D in pregnant women with recurrent vaginitis and determine whether these parameters contribute to the etiology of the disease. METHODS: The study included 30 pregnant women diagnosed with recurrent vaginitis in their first trimester (group I), who presented at least twice between 1.5.2019 and 1.5.2022 at the obstetrics and gynecology clinic, and 30 healthy pregnant women in their first trimester without any complaints (group II). The vagititis group was compared with the control group for serum levels of vitamin B12, homocysteine, folic acid, and vitamin D. RESULTS: A comparison of the results between the groups revealed the following: homocysteine levels (μmol/L) were 10.75 (6.38-24.90) in group I (vaginitis positive) and 9.32 (4.26-17.10) in group II (control); vitamin B12 levels (ng/L) were 149.00 (63.00-328.00) in group I and 261.00 (126.00-544.00) in group II; folate levels (μg/L) were 10.56 (3.93-23.33) in group I and 9.48 (3.53-24.10) in group II; vitamin D levels (ng/mL) were 36.54 (23.65-75.68) in group I and 52.45 (26.57-105.00) in group II. Statistically significant elevation in homocysteine levels was observed in the vaginitis group (group I) (p<0.05). Vitamin B12 and D levels were significantly lower in the vaginitis group (group I) (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: In pregnant women with recurrent vaginitis, the levels of homocysteine, vitamin B12, and vitamin D may play a role in the etiology of the condition, and vitamins B12 and D may be considered for use in treatment.",

While the study offers valuable insights, we have several constructive suggestions. The lack of a standardized anesthesia protocol (local vs. general anesthesia) may have influenced the results, as patients under local anesthesia were awake during the procedure. Previous studies suggest intraoperative communication and patient awareness can impact pain levels and recovery. To clarify the effect of anesthesia type on recovery, we recommend conducting a subgroup analysis based on the anesthesia method. Although the CT group(combined treatment) showed satisfactory pain control (VAS < 3.3), the observed VAS score between days 1 and 3 may not reflect the actual patient experience. Except for the VAS score for leg pain on the third day after surgery, the net intergroup differences at other time points were less than the minimal clinically important differences recommended in the literature(a change of 10 for the 100 mm pain VAS). Furthermore, the study does not assess patient satisfaction with pain management, making it difficult to determine the clinical importance of the treatment effect.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common, significant, debilitating symptom of anticancer treatment, and continues to plague patients and medical fraternity. This study aimed to explore the associations between CIPN and functional vitamin B12 deficiency, as well as other predictors including nutritional and non-nutritional factors among cancer patients. METHODS: A prospective study design was conducted to achieve the study objectives, utilizing a non-probability purposive sampling technique. A consecutive case series of 64 adults (≥ 18 years) newly diagnosed cancer patients of various sites, registered and scheduled to receive the first cycle of chemotherapy were recruited from the Oncology Department of European Gaza Hospital (EGH). At two different points of time, at the baseline before the initiation of the first cycle of chemotherapy (pre) and after the completion of the chemotherapy regimen (post), vitamin B12 status was evaluated using serum vitamin B12 and it is related metabolites methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine (Hcy), and CIPN was evaluated using patient neurotoxicity questionnaire (PNQ). RESULTS: The results reported the presence of a functional vitamin B12 deficiency, such that there is a drastic reduction in serum vitamin B12 levels (355.0(IQR 115.0) to 219.0(IQR 177.0) pg/mL, P < 0.001), accompanied by a significant increase in it is related metabolites MMA (3.9(IQR 3.0) to 49.7(IQR 32.0) ng/mL, P < 0.001) and Hcy (3.90(IQR 0.85) to 12.60(IQR 7.05) ng/mL, P < 0.001) after the completion of  chemotherapy regimen. Increases in serum MMA levels significantly predicted increases in PNQ scores (b = 0.02, R2 = 0.30, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Functional vitamin B12 deficiency as defined by increased MMA levels is a distinct risk factor in the development of CIPN in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Further studies are required to evaluate the impact of vitamin B12 therapy in the management and/or prevention of CIPN.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Vitamin B12 deficiency in children is treated with either parenteral or oral supplementation. Although the efficacy of supplementation is reportedly comparable for the 2 routes in adults, there is limited data for children. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to compare the efficacy and safety of parenteral vs oral B12 supplementation in children with vitamin B12 deficiency anemia. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, four Clinical Trials Registries, and 2 gray literature databases, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the parenteral vs oral routes of administering B12 in children with vitamin B12 deficiency anemia. DATA EXTRACTION: Among 6467 citations screened, there was only 1 eligible RCT, in which children with vitamin B12 deficiency anemia received 1 dose of 1000 µg parenterally before being randomized to either parenteral or oral therapy. DATA ANALYSIS: After 3 months, the parenteral route resulted in higher B12 levels compared with the oral route (median [IQR]: 653 [459, 835] vs 506 [399, 726] pg/mL). The changes from baseline in vitamin B12 levels (median [IQR]: 600 [389, 775] vs 399 [313, 606] pg/mL, P = .016) and hemoglobin (2.7 [0.4, 4.6] vs 0.5 [-0.1, 1.2] g/dL, P = .001) were also significantly greater with the parenteral route. There was no data on safety. In terms of quality, the RCT was judged to be at \"high risk of bias.\" CONCLUSION: Limited evidence from a single, methodologically weak RCT suggested that the parenteral route is more efficacious than the oral route. However, considering the limitations in quality and quantity of the available evidence, this should be interpreted with caution.

This case study involves a male in his 70s with multiple risk factors, including a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%, who developed vasoplegia after taking lisinopril on the day of his elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Despite initial management with vasopressors, the patient's condition necessitated postponing the CABG. The patient was stabilized in the ICU with a combination of vasopressin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and hydrocortisone, and his vasoplegia was successfully treated with hydroxocobalamin, leading to significant clinical improvement. The patient later underwent a successful CABG without preoperative ACE inhibitor use. This case underscores the potential of hydroxocobalamin as an effective treatment for vasoplegia, particularly following ACE inhibitor use in cardiac surgery patients."

This study evaluates the B12 and FA level changes before and after HSCT. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from 125 patients who underwent HSCT between March 2019 and February 2024. B12 and FA levels were measured at three time points: before transplantation, one month after, and six months after. Sixty-two patients had complete data. B12 deficiency was defined as levels < 200 pg/mL and insufficiency as 200-300 pg/mL. Folate deficiency was classified as insufficiency ≤ 3 ng/mL, indeterminate for 4.0-5.8 ng/mL and typical for 5.9-26.8 ng/mL. Patients with B12 < 300 pg/mL and folic acid < 5 ng/mL were treated at all stages. RESULTS: Among the 62 patients, 24 (38.7%) were girls, with a median age of 4 years (1.75-8.25). Median B12 levels were 398 pg/mL (pre-transplant), 892 pg/mL (1 month post), and 430 pg/mL (6 months post). The second time point had significantly higher B12 levels (p < 0.001). Median folate levels were 9.7 ng/mL, 6.95 ng/mL, and 11.3 ng/mL at the respective time points (p < 0.05), with the second time point significantly lower. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric HSCT patients experience increased demands for B12 and FA despite accurate treatment, leading to potential deficiencies. Close monitoring, early supplementation, and supplementing high levels of these micronutrients are essential.",

RECENT FINDINGS: We used studies on the amount of B12 absorbed following oral B12 application and non-comparative case-series studies to synthesize evidence on pharmacological effects of oral B12 (between < 10 µg and 3000 µg) in people with manifested deficiency. There is a dose-dependent intestinal absorption of B12 and in the same time effects on body metabolism and functions. Food supplements providing ≤ 20 µg B12 daily are unlikely to cause pharmacological effects, while 50 µg might correct abnormal biochemical markers in some deficient patients. Foods for special medical purposes for people who cannot absorb B12 may contain 100 µg to 150 µg B12. This dose may ensure 1-4 µg of the vitamin reaching the circulation on a daily basis independent of intrinsic factor. Dosages ≥ 200 µg/d should be considered as drugs that can correct anemia, metabolic markers and clinical symptoms. The content of vitamin B12 in food supplements should not exceed 20 µg. In addition, people with deficiency should receive appropriate medical treatment with high dose B12.",

CASE PRESENTATION: We present a nine-month-old boy who initially presented with hypotonia and developmental delay, diagnosed as vitamin B12 deficiency. Upon he did not respond to vitamin replacement treatment, he was diagnosed with SRD by whole-exome sequencing (WES). The boy improved dramatically under treatment with L-dopa, 5-hydroxytryptophan and BH4. CONCLUSIONS: We aim to emphasize that SRD can present with nonspecific symptoms, leading to a diagnostic delay for this rare but treatable disease.

METHODS: A total of 44 eyes of 22 patients with KC who underwent CXL were included in this prospective study. After CXL, one eye of these patients received OMK2 eye drop and standard post-CXL treatment (OMK2 group), while the fellow eye received only standard post-CXL treatment (control group). The following parameters were analyzed in the pre- and post-CXL procedure periods (1st, 3rd and 6th months): corneal sensitivity, tear film stability, central corneal thickness (CCT), and the corneal sub-basal nerve plexus (sbNP) parameters (including corneal nerve fiber density [CNFD], corneal nerve branch density [CNBD], corneal nerve fiber length [CNFL], corneal total branch density [CTBD], corneal nerve fiber area [CNFA], corneal nerve fiber width [CNFW]). RESULTS: Following CXL, a comparison of the baseline and month 6 data revealed that CNFA decreased in the control group (p < 0.001) and did not differ in the OMK2 group (p = 0.283). Other corneal sbNP parameters exhibited a decrease when comparing baseline and 6 months in each group (all p < 0.05). In addition, CCT in the OMK2 group was not significantly different between baseline and month 6 (p = 0.052). However, a decline in CCT of the control groups was observed during this specified time interval (p = 0.009). Corneal sensitivity or tear film stability parameters did not differ significantly between groups at any time point or over time within each group (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The use of OMK2 eye drop after CXL may provide more stable CNFA. In addition, it may also provide faster recovery in CCT.",

Despite high serum vitamin B12 level, elevated level of serum homocysteine, positive anti-intrinsic factor antibody, and T2-weighted hyperintense lesions on spinal cord MRI led to a diagnosis of subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Treatment with intramuscular mecobalamin injections improved the pancytopenia and resolved the MRI lesions. The pancytopenia in this patient was considered to be caused by pernicious anemia. The presence of anti-intrinsic factor antibody can cause falsely normal or elevated serum vitamin B12 levels. When patients with pancytopenia report numbness, even without a decrease in serum vitamin B12 levels, pernicious anemia and subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord should be suspected, and measurements of serum homocysteine and anti-intrinsic factor antibodies should be considered.",

AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate whether the antidepressant effect of V. jatamansi may operate through modulating vitamin B12-related ileal homeostasis using a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mouse model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A CUMS-induced depression model was established in mice for five weeks, after which V. jatamansi extracts were administered for three weeks. At week eight, the forced swimming test and novelty-suppressed feeding test were conducted. H&E staining assessed ileal pathology, while 16S rDNA sequencing analyzed changes in ileal microbiota. Additionally, B12 in serum, cubilin (CUBN) and amnionless (AMN) in ileal tissue, methionine synthase (MS) and homocysteine (Hcy) in the hippocampus were measured using ELISA, and the correlations between them and ileal microbiota were explored. RESULTS: Mice in the model group exhibited significant depressive behavior. However, after treatment with V. jatamansi, immobility time and feeding latency were improved. H&E staining demonstrated the repairing effect of V. jatamansi on the ileum regarding tissue damage. The alpha and beta diversity of the ileal microbiota were regulated and converged to the normal group. Additionally, V. jatamansi modulated B12, CUBN, AMN, MS, and Hcy levels. Correlation analysis showed that there are certain correlations between a variety of microorganisms and B12-related factors. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the mechanism of V. jatamansi in treating depression may be through repairing depression-associated intestinal damage. This repair process may affect the intestinal absorption and microbial production of B12. By reversing the reduction of serum B12, V. jatamansi ultimately reduces the infiltration of Hcy into the CNS.",

      "abstract": "Background Vitamin B12 deficiency, or cobalamin deficiency, is common among populations with low consumption of animal-based products, mainly in India, due to religious and socioeconomic factors, which significantly increase the deficiency rate. The condition has been characterized by a wide range of clinical and hematological symptoms, mainly affecting the blood and nervous system. This study aims to assess the clinical and hematological characteristics of patients with vitamin B12 deficiency and assess the therapeutic response to supplementation with vitamin B12. Methodology This two-year, in-hospital study was conducted at K. J. Somaiya Medical College and Hospital. The study involved 180 patients aged between 18 and 70 years with hemoglobin below 13 g/dL for males, less than 12 g/dL for females, and serum vitamin B12 levels below 250 pg/mL. Data on demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients, along with hematological parameters, including complete blood count, peripheral smear, reticulocyte count, and bone marrow examination, were collected. Each patient received six intramuscular injections per week of 1,000 µg of vitamin B12. The hematological parameters were measured at different follow-up intervals, and the therapeutic response was measured using the one-way analysis of variance. We employed Pearson's correlation coefficient to investigate the relationship between the severity of anemia and vitamin B12 level. Results The study showed a higher prevalence of male patients, accounting for 105 (58.3%) of the sample, with the majority of patients aged between 46 and 60 years, totaling 70 (38.9%). Common comorbidities included hypertension in 60 (33.3%) and diabetes in 45 (25%) patients. The most frequently reported symptom was fatigue, present in 120 (66.7%) patients, followed by neurological symptoms such as tingling and numbness in the extremities reported by 98 (54.4%) patients. Baseline hematological assessments indicated macrocytic anemia, with a mean hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL and an elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 104.7 fL. At the end of six weeks of vitamin B12 therapy, there were notable improvements, with hemoglobin levels rising to 12.6 g/dL, MCV decreasing to 91.3 fL, and reticulocyte count increasing to 2.1%. A strong positive correlation was observed between hemoglobin levels and serum vitamin B12 concentrations (r = 0.75, p < 0.001). Conclusions Vitamin B12 deficiency leads to clinical and hematological abnormalities, including macrocytic anemia and neurological symptoms. This study demonstrates that vitamin B12 supplementation effectively reverses these abnormalities, improving both hematological and neurological outcomes. Given the prevalence of deficiency, routine screening and supplementation are recommended, particularly for at-risk populations such as vegetarians and older adults. Further research is needed to assess the long-term effects of supplementation, particularly its potential role in reducing cardiovascular risk in individuals with vitamin B12 deficiency."

      "abstract": "Background: Vitamin B12 is an essential nutrient crucial for overall health, and deficiencies can lead to hearing loss. Objective: The aim of the systematic review was to explore the intricate connection between vitamin B12 deficiency and hearing loss using a systematic literature review. Methods: A systematic literature search was carried out to identify the articles exploring the connection between vitamin B12 deficiency and hearing loss. Electronic databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases were used to identify the relevant studies. Results: A total of 612 studies were identified from 3 databases, and after stepwise screening, 9 articles were found eligible for the data extraction and inclusion in the review. Most of the studies had observed statistically-significant differences in the hearing thresholds with low vitamin B12 levels. However, few studies found hearing loss in the low frequencies (250 and 500 Hz), and others have found elevated thresholds above 4 KHz. Factors such as age, gender, and treatment for vitamin B12 did not show any significant changes in the hearing thresholds. Conclusion: The systematic review revealed that individuals with lower vitamin B12 levels tended to have a higher prevalence of hearing impairment than those with normal or elevated levels. Vitamin B12 deficiency, coupled with high homocysteine levels and low folate concentrations, may contribute to different degrees of hearing loss, particularly in the elderly. Lower serum levels of vitamin B12 have been associated with slight to mild hearing loss, while cochlear dysfunction and poorer hearing thresholds have also been observed in individuals with vitamin B12 deficiency. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining optimal levels of vitamin B12 for preserving hearing health and warrant further investigation into potential interventions."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin or Cbl) plays a crucial role in normal human growth and development, as well as in neurological, cardiovascular, and immune systems. Previous studies reported association of high levels of cobalamin with solid cancers, hematological disorders, and liver diseases. Reporting the frequency of comorbid diseases with high serum Vitamin B12 level in patients attending KSAMC at Madinah. METHODS: This is a retrospective, cross-sectional study on data collected during 1 year (May 2022-May 2023) from 3511 report, patients with high cobalamin blood level (normal upper limit 771 pg/mL) as determined in our laboratory on COBAS® were included. Patient's clinical diagnosis, medication history and other laboratory parameters performed were also checked for disease comorbidities. RESULTS: Our results revealed statistically significant increase in serum Vitamin B12 in patients with diabetes mellitus, with the use of this vitamin as supplement therapy 53.2% (the predominant comorbidity), together with liver, blood, chest, kidney, thyroid and neurological diseases, and various solid tumors. A positive correlation was found between serum Vitamin B12, age and laboratory parameters including aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and direct bilirubin, and a negative correlation was seen between serum Vitamin B12 level, serum albumin (ALB), red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and free T3 (FT3). While, no significant correlation with the rest of the checked parameters was detected. CONCLUSION: This study found high serum level of Vitamin B12 associated with various disease entities, for example, (diabetes mellitus treated with Vitamin B12 as supplement therapy, liver, blood, chest, kidney, thyroid, neurological diseases, and various solid tumors), so when Vitamin B12 is high, further investigations will be recommended. Most of the comorbidities were benign in Saudis, followed by Egyptians with predominance of female-aged 50-70 year old."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Elevated vitamin B12 (B12) levels are linked to an increased risk of cancers, including hematological malignancies. This study focuses on the relationship between elevated B12 and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs): Polycythemia Vera (PV), Primary Myelofibrosis (MF), Essential Thrombocytosis (ET), and Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML). Elevated B12 in MPNs is believed to arise from increased transcobalamin I (TCI) secretion by proliferating leukocytes, leading to higher serum levels. B12 may serve as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for these conditions. However, its sensitivity, specificity, and cutoff levels are unclear. AIM: To assess the prevalence of high B12 levels in MPN patients, determine the median levels, identify a diagnostic cutoff, and evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of B12 as a marker. METHODS: Data were retrieved from the National Center for Cancer Care and Research in Doha, Qatar, for MPN patients from January 2016 to December 2022. RESULTS: A total of 467 patients were included: 232 with CML, 98 with PV, 88 with ET, and 50 with MF. The majority were male (66%) and of Asian origin (56%), with a median age of 48.7 years. CBC results showed median hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL, WBC count of 73 x 10^3/uL, and platelet count of 531 x 10^3/uL. Elevated B12 levels were found in 95 patients (20%): 71% CML, 14% PV, 10% MF, and 5% ET. Extreme elevations were seen in 59 patients. The mean B12 level decreased from 747.3 ± 686.5 pg/mL before treatment to 397.9 ± 343.7 pg/mL after one year (p=0.01). Median levels were 458 pg/mL (718) before treatment and 301 pg/mL (229) after. In the extreme high B12 group, the mean was 1722 pg/mL before and 677 pg/mL after treatment. CONCLUSION: Elevated B12 levels are associated with disease activity in CML. However, their role as a reliable marker for disease monitoring remains uncertain, and further studies are needed to confirm their utility for CML progression."

Despite its established link to psychiatric symptoms, vitamin B12 deficiency often remains underdiagnosed. The aim of this study is to highlight the association between vitamin B12 deficiency and acute psychosis, emphasizing the importance of early detection and treatment. METHODS: This is a retrospective case series with inclusion criteria of diagnosis of Acute and Transient Psychotic Disorder (ATPD) and associated vitamin B12 Deficiency over the past five years. Patients with comorbid psychiatric illnesses and substance use other than nicotine, hematological and neurological symptoms associated with vitamin B12 deficiency and significant life stressors prior to onset of illness were excluded from the study. A review of electronic medical records of all these patients was done. Out of these patients, eight cases satisfied the study selection criteria. RESULTS: Sociodemographic, investigation, and treatment details of all eight patients are presented. All of them received low-dose antipsychotics and vitamin B12 replacement therapy, resulting in significant improvement. Vegetarian dietary habits were identified as a common risk factor. CONCLUSION: Vitamin B12 deficiency can manifest solely as ATPD, particularly in individuals following vegetarian diets. Early detection and treatment are crucial to prevent irreversible psychiatric and neurological damage. Routine vitamin B12 level assessments are recommended in patients with mental and psychiatric disturbances."

This study investigates the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency among diabetic patients using metformin at Dr. Sulaiman Al Habib Medical Group (HMG) hospitals. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized electronic medical records from the VIDA system (www.cloudsolutions.com) over a one-year period. Participants included adult T2DM patients managed with metformin therapy. Data collection involved demographic details, medical history, medication usage, and serum vitamin B12 levels. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics and comparative tests to assess deficiency prevalence across demographics. RESULTS: Among the study population (N=37,781), vitamin B12 deficiency prevalence ranged from 460 (4.6%) to 507 (5.5%) across four quarters of 2023. Females exhibited a higher prevalence than males (P < 0.05), particularly in the second and fourth quarters. Age-related analyses identified younger and middle-aged groups (≤25 years and 36-45 years) as having higher deficiency rates (P < 0.001). Medication use, specifically metformin, correlated with increased deficiency prevalence (P < 0.001). DISCUSSION: The findings underscore the significance of gender, age, and medication use in influencing vitamin B12 status among diabetic patients using metformin. The study highlights the need for tailored monitoring strategies and interventions to mitigate deficiency risks and optimize patient outcomes. Future research should explore mechanisms underlying these associations and expand findings to broader populations. CONCLUSION: This study provides critical insights into the epidemiology of vitamin B12 deficiency among diabetic patients using metformin at HMG hospitals. The results emphasize the importance of personalized healthcare approaches to address nutrient deficiencies and improve overall patient care. This study summarizes the key elements of your research paper, focusing on the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency in relation to metformin use among diabetic patients."

However, there hasn't been extensive research conducted on this particular patient group. The reported incidence rates vary widely, ranging from 20% to 90%, reflecting the complexity of its diagnosis. Dialysis patients often face multiple nutritional deficiencies, including a lack of essential vitamins, due to factors such as dietary restrictions, impaired absorption, and nutrient loss during dialysis. Diagnosing vitamin B12 deficiency in these patients is challenging, and addressing it is crucial to prevent complications and improve their overall quality of life. This review paper delves into the available body of evidence on vitamin B12 deficiency in dialysis patients, examining the contributing risk factors, diagnostic challenges, potential complications, and available treatment options. It provides a well-rounded perspective on the topic, making it a valuable resource for researchers, healthcare practitioners, and policymakers interested in addressing the nutritional needs of dialysis patients."

This study investigates the effects of taurine and homocysteine on PPARγ, focusing on their roles in osteoclastogenesis and bone health. In-silico analyses, including molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulations, revealed that both taurine and homocysteine bind competitively to the PPARγ ligand-binding domain, exhibiting distinctive antagonistic modes, including destabilization of PPARγ's key helices H3, H4/5, H11, and H12. In-vitro experiments further supported these results, demonstrating that taurine protects against oxidative damage, enhances bone mineralization, and reduces the expression levels of PPARγ, while also downregulating negative regulators of the Wnt signaling pathway, such as SOST and DKK1. Homocysteine, on the other hand, was observed to increase the expression of these regulators and impair bone formation. Vitamin B12 was included in the study due to its known role in mitigating hyperhomocysteinemia, a condition linked to impaired bone health and reduced taurine levels. While vitamin B12 alone demonstrated some beneficial effects, it did not achieve the same level of efficacy as taurine. However, a combination of taurine and vitamin B12 showed greater efficacy in ameliorating hyperhomocysteinemia-induced osteoporosis. Overall, this study highlights taurine's therapeutic potential in counteracting the adverse effects of hyperhomocysteinemia on bone health and underscores the need for further research into taurine's mechanisms in osteoporosis treatment.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To identify the cost-effectiveness of four policy options related to folic acid supplements after considering the side effects of masking vitamin B12 (B12) deficiency in primary stroke prevention for hypertensive patients in China. STUDY DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: Four policies were considered: Policy A, Do nothing to address folate status in hypertensive patients at risk for stroke; Policy B, Folate supplementation without pre-screening for vitamin B12 deficiency; Policy C, Folate supplementation with pre-screening all patients for B12 deficiency and add B12 supplements if B12 is deficient; and Policy D, Folate supplementation only for those whose folate is deficient, pre-screen all patients for both B12 and folate deficiencies and add B12 supplements if B12 is deficient. A decision tree with a five-year period of intervention based on the China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial (CSPPT) from the Chinese healthcare system perspective estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for Policy B, Policy C and Policy D vs. Policy A. RESULTS: At a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of 3 times the national GDP per capita ($38,198), Policy B was not cost-effective compared to Policy A, with an ICER of $47,968 per QALY due to QALYs lost introduced by the delayed diagnosis of B12 deficiency and the potentially underestimated costs associated with treating neuropathy. However, Policy C and Policy D were cost-effective compared to Policy A, with an ICER of $32,615 and $20,287 per QALY, respectively. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that there would be a 72.7% and 83.5% chance that the additional cost of Policy C and Policy D, compared with Policy A, was at or below the WTP threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Folate supplementation with integrated screening for B12 and folate deficiencies is considered the most cost-effective strategy for primary stroke prevention in hypertensive elderly patients in China. Future research should focus on advancing precision medicine to assess the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of nationwide implementation across diverse sub-populations within the context of integrated screening, ensuring efficient and tailored public nutrition strategy delivery.",

      "abstract": "Whippets abuse, prevalent among recreational drug users, poses significant health risks, particularly through the inactivation of vitamin B12 by nitrous oxide (N2O). This deficiency can lead to myelopathy, resulting in serious neurological complications. We present two female patients, aged 22 and 35, with a history of regular whippet use over the past three years, who exhibited clinical symptoms of myelopathy, including motor weakness, rigidity, sensory changes, and gait abnormalities. The 35-year-old patient showed weakness and swelling in her legs; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no acute findings, but lab results indicated a critically low serum vitamin B12 level (102 pg/mL), elevated homocysteine (44 µmol/L), and high methylmalonic acid (29,054 nmol/L). She improved with vitamin B12, vitamin D supplementation, and physical and occupational therapy. The 22-year-old patient reported progressive stiffness and tingling, with MRI revealing T2 hyperintensities in the brain and longitudinal T2 hyperintensities in the posterior spinal cord; her vitamin B12 level was 180 pg/mL, and she responded positively to supplementation and physical therapy. These cases underscore the risk of nitrous oxide-induced myelopathy associated with vitamin B12 deficiency among whippet users. Early recognition and intervention are essential to prevent irreversible neurological damage, and routine screening for vitamin B12 deficiency in this population is recommended. Further research is needed to explore the long-term implications of N2O abuse."

      "abstract": "Background: Pancytopenia is characterized by a decrease in all three types of blood cells. Instead of being a standalone disease, it acts as a common outcome resulting from various factors, including infections, autoimmune disorders, genetic issues, nutritional deficiencies, and malignancies. Pinpointing the root cause of pancytopenia poses a challenge but is essential for devising an effective treatment plan and predicting the likely prognosis. Vitamin B12 deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia, pancytopenia, and various neuropsychiatric symptoms. However, diagnosing vitamin B12 deficiency lacks a definitive gold standard. Case Presentation: We present two cases where patients initially exhibited pancytopenia with seemingly normal vitamin B12 levels. Based on a bone marrow biopsy, they were initially diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Subsequent investigations revealed elevated serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels, leading to a revised diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency. Both patients showed positive responses to adequate vitamin B12 supplementation. Conclusion: Our case series highlights the importance of ruling out alternative causes of dysplasia in MDS when solely morphological abnormalities are observed on a bone marrow biopsy. It also underscores the crucial aspect of assessing MMA and homocysteine levels in individuals with normal vitamin B12 levels when there is a high clinical suspicion of B12 deficiency."

      "abstract": "Vitamin B12 is significant for DNA synthesis, red blood cell formation, and nervous system function. Inadequate vitamin B12 levels may result in a higher risk of depression, necessitating the need for supplementation to improve mood and cognitive function. However, the use of vitamin B12 supplementation varies across studies. This review aims to evaluate the effect of vitamin B12 supplementation on cognitive memory function and depressive symptoms among participants who may have mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This review adhered to the Cochrane Handbook and PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, CENTRAL, Medline, and Ovid, with no constraints on geography or demographics, up to August 31, 2024. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Data on study characteristics, treatment details, and outcomes were extracted. The risk of bias was assessed using the revised Cochrane ROB2 tool. A meta-analysis of the effect of vitamin B12 on cognitive memory and depression was conducted using Jamovi software (The jamovi project (2024). jamovi (Version 2.5) [Computer Software]. Retrieved from https://www.jamovi.org). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. The results yielded 483 records that were screened based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. Excluding duplicates and irrelevant studies, the meta-analysis finally included nine RCTs. For cognitive memory function, eight of the nine included studies were analyzed, showing an average standardized mean difference of -0.03 (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.07 to 0.01), indicating no significant effect of vitamin B12 supplementation (p = 0.1801) and no significant heterogeneity. Regarding depressive symptoms, three of the nine included studies were analyzed, yielding an average standardized mean difference of -0.01 (95% CI: -0.0773 to 0.0525), also showing no significant effect (p = 0.708). These results suggest that vitamin B12 complex supplementation has an insignificant effect on cognitive function and depressive symptoms in the general population. However, further research is needed to explore the conditions under which B12 is most effective, providing clearer guidelines for its use in clinical practice."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate the effects of folate and vitamin B12 on psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia and low serum folate levels. METHODS: Fifty-five schizophrenia patients with serum folate levels lower than 6 mg/L were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to supplementation with 5 mg of folate and 500 μg of vitamin B12 per day (the folate group, n = 36) or placebo (the placebo group, n = 19) for 24 weeks. We evaluated patients' symptomatology with the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) and cognitive functions with Cogstate. RESULTS: During the 24-week intervention, serum folate and vitamin B12 levels significantly increased, and homocysteine level significantly decreased in the folate group, but these markers did not significantly change in the placebo group. There were no significant changes in scores of total and each subscale of PANSS, and Cogstate between the folate and placebo groups. A subgroup analysis within the folate groups revealed no significant differences in the changes of psychotic symptoms severity or cognitive functions among patients with different degrees of folate level increments. CONCLUSION: Our finding suggested that the extent of increased folate levels did not exert a notable impact on the changes of psychotic symptoms severity or cognitive function in our patients. It may also due to the relatively stable condition in our recruited patients, so supplementation of folate cannot show its effectiveness. Whether folate can improve psychopathology in moderate to severe patients with schizophrenia should be evaluated with a larger sample size in the future."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Post-stroke depression (PSD) is a common neuropsychiatric complication after a stroke with complex mechanisms. However, few studies have identified the role of vitamin B12 and folate in the occurrence and pathophysiology of PSD. The aim of our study is to investigate the relationship among vitamin B12, folate, their transporter genes, and early-onset PSD. METHOD AND MATERIAL: A total of 173 ischemic stroke patients were recruited in Xiangya Hospital of Central South University. We collected peripheral blood samples, clinical data, and demographics at admission. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale was used for screening for the existence of depression at 2 weeks after stroke onset. Serum vitamin B12 and folate level were measured based on double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of transcobalamin 2 (TCN2) and solute carrier family 19 member 1 were genotyped using SNPscanTM multiplex SNP typing Kit. RESULTS: Eighty-four patients were diagnosed with PSD at 2 weeks after stroke onset, and the incidence rate was 48.6%. Serum vitamin B12 level in PSD group was significantly lower than those in the non-PSD group (p=0.018). Binary logistic regression revealed that TCN2 rs1801198 GG genotype and G allele were associated with an increased risk of PSD after adjustment for confounding factors (for GG genotype, OR = 4.253, 95% CI = 1.711~10.572, p = 0.002; for G allele, OR = 2.134, 95% CI = 1.362~3.343, p = 0.001). Moreover, individuals with the rs1801198 G allele in the PSD group exhibited lower vitamin B12 level than those with the rs1801198 G allele in the non-PSD group (p=0.045). CONCLUSION: TCN2 rs1801198 and vitamin B12 are associated with the risk of early-onset PSD, and they may be involved in the development of PSD. Our study presents a novel standpoint for the treatment of PSD and gains insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of PSD."

      "abstract": "Vitamin B12 deficiency is a prevalent condition that can lead to serious neurological disorders, including subacute combined degeneration (SCD) of the spinal cord, which can result in lasting damage if not promptly treated. This report discusses a unique case of a 53-year-old female patient who presented with a one-week history of gait instability and falls, ultimately diagnosed with SCD due to severe vitamin B12 deficiency. Notably, the patient exhibited an atypical presentation, lacking classic symptoms such as paraesthesia and hematologic abnormalities, which often accompany B12 deficiency. Clinical evaluation revealed no previous neurological deficits or hematological issues, suggesting an acute decline in B12 levels. Neuroimaging, particularly MRI of the spine, showed demyelination affecting the dorsal columns and corticospinal tracts, consistent with SCD while excluding ischemic causes. Laboratory tests confirmed low serum B12 levels, supporting the diagnosis. This case underscores the necessity for clinicians to maintain a high index of suspicion for vitamin B12 deficiency in patients presenting with unexplained neurological symptoms. Early intervention is crucial; in this case, immediate treatment with intramuscular B12 led to significant recovery in gait stability and neurological function. The findings highlight the importance of thorough assessments and ongoing education about the diverse presentations of B12 deficiency, especially in populations at risk, such as the elderly and those with malabsorption issues. Awareness of the neurological consequences of B12 deficiency is essential for effective management and improved patient outcomes."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vitamin B12 is essential for neurological function, red blood cell formation, and DNA synthesis. Deficiency can lead to diverse health conditions, including megaloblastic anemia and neurological issues. Oral supplementation is a standard treatment for B12 deficiency. The Sucrosomial® carrier system offers an innovative approach that enhances supplemental nutrient absorption and bioavailability. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of oral Sucrosomial® vitamin B12 formulation vs various conventional B12 supplements, randomly selected from local pharmacies, in increasing and maintaining circulatory B12 levels in healthy deficient adults (200-300 pg/mL). METHODS: A randomized, double-blind clinical trial was conducted across three centers in Pakistan from April to July 2024. At KEMU, participants received either Sucrosomial® vitamin B12 or Mecogen SL B12; at LRH, Sucrosomial® B12 or B-SUB B12; and at LUMHS, Sucrosomial® B12, Evermin B12, or Neuromax B12. Participants took a daily single dose of 1,000 μg of the assigned B12 formulation for 7 days. Serum B12 levels were measured at baseline (day 0) and on days 1, 3, 5, and 7. RESULTS: Sucrosomial® B12 was significantly more effective than conventional B12 formulations in increasing and maintaining higher serum B12 levels across all time points. At KEMU, it reached a peak concentration of 454 ± 3.9 pg/mL by day 5, compared to 274 ± 11.1 pg/mL with Mecogen SL B12. At LRH, it peaked at 496 ± 34.4 pg/mL by day 5 versus 304 ± 49.4 pg/mL for B-SUB B12. At LUMHS, it reached 592.7 ± 74.3 pg/mL by day 7, compared to 407.24 ± 41.6 pg/mL for Evermin B12 and 263.82 ± 23.8 pg/mL for Neuromax B12. Sucrosomial® B12 was the only formulation to surpass the deficiency-borderline threshold (200-300 pg/mL) within 24 h of the first dose and was well tolerated with no reported side effects. CONCLUSION: Sucrosomial® vitamin B12 demonstrated superior efficacy in rapidly and consistently elevating and maintaining higher circulatory B12 levels compared to conventional supplements. Its characteristic absorption mode and proven efficacy suggest it could effectively address B12 deficiency in a broad range of populations, including those with gastrointestinal conditions and pernicious anemia, thereby supporting overall health.

Changes in brain metabolism might contribute to these phenotypes, as many of the deleted genes are involved in metabolic processes, but this is unknown. This study shows for the first time that Tbx1 haploinsufficiency causes brain metabolic imbalance. We studied two mouse models of 22q11.2DS using mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and transcriptomics. We found that Tbx1 +/- mice and Df1/+ mice, with a multigenic deletion that includes Tbx1, have elevated brain methylmalonic acid, which is highly brain-toxic. Focusing on Tbx1 mutants, we found that they also have a more general brain metabolomic imbalance that affects key metabolic pathways, such as glutamine-glutamate and fatty acid metabolism. We provide transcriptomic evidence of a genotype-vitamin B12 treatment interaction. In addition, vitamin B12 treatment rescued a behavioural anomaly in Tbx1 +/- mice. Further studies will be required to establish whether the specific metabolites affected by Tbx1 haploinsufficiency are potential biomarkers of brain disease status in 22q11.2DS patients.",

      "abstract": "Background Megaloblastic anemia is characterized by abnormally large red blood cells caused by a deficiency in either vitamin B12 or folic acid, both of which are essential for DNA synthesis. Vitamin B12 insufficiency can lead to severe neurological damage, making early identification of vitamin B12 deficiency crucial to prevent irreversible harm. Vitamin B12 deficiency results in decreased levels of holotranscobalamin (Holo-TC) and increased levels of methylmalonic acid (MMA). Methylmalonic acid is considered the gold standard for diagnosing B12 deficiency because it is a specific marker that rises when B12 is insufficient, even when serum B12 levels appear normal. Elevated MMA levels reflect impaired B12 metabolism, making it a critical tool for early detection and intervention. Previous research indicates that Holo-TC, the active form of vitamin B12 available to cells, is a more specific diagnostic tool for early vitamin B12 deficiency than total B12. This study aims to determine the diagnostic validity of total vitamin B12 and Holo-TC using MMA as the gold standard in patients with megaloblastic anemia. Methods A total of 95 megaloblastic anemia patients were selected from Jinnah Hospital and Lahore General Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan, after receiving approval from the ethical review committees. This was a cross-sectional study. Whole blood, serum, and urine samples were collected in ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) vials, gel vials, and urine containers, respectively. The EDTA samples were used for complete blood count measurements using a hematology analyzer (Sysmex-XT 1800i, Sysmex America, Inc., Mundelein, IL), while serum and urine samples were employed for the detection of serum folic acid, cobalamin, Holo-TC, and MMA levels through manual enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of Holo-TC and cobalamin were calculated. Results The majority of patients fell within the age group of 20-70 years, with 57% of them being females and 43% males; Holo-TC exhibited a sensitivity of 98.9% and specificity of 50.00%, with a PPV of 98.90% and NPV of 50%. Vitamin B12 demonstrated a sensitivity of 63% and specificity of 50%, with a PPV of 98.33% and NPV of 2.85%. The diagnostic accuracy of Holo-TC and vitamin B12 was observed to be 97.8% and 63%, respectively.  Conclusions Between the two, Holo-TC displays higher diagnostic accuracy than vitamin B12 and can serve as the primary test for patients suspected of having vitamin B12 deficiency."

The long-term use of metformin has been associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. The aim of this review is to investigate the effect of metformin on vitamin B12 levels and identify any risk factors. Method: A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, PubMed and ProQuest Central. Selected articles were peer-reviewed articles, written in English and published from 2015 and onwards. Excluded articles were case reports, reviews or meta-analyses, as well as those with no access to full text. Results: In total, 21 articles were included. There was a significant association between metformin use and vitamin B12 levels in 17 studies, while 4 studies found no such association. The risk factors examined were metformin dose, treatment duration, patient age and patient ethnicity. Conclusion: In summary, metformin use was associated with lower vitamin B12 concentrations, and higher doses and longer durations of treatment increase the risk of vitamin B12 deficiency. Routine vitamin B12 screening is recommended, prioritizing higher-risk patients. Further research is needed to identify when to initiate monitoring."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Residual low back and leg pain can occur after percutaneous endoscopic interlaminar discectomy (PEID) and compromise early surgical outcomes. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of combining dexamethasone with vitamin B12 (VB12) via epidural injection in improving the symptoms of low back and leg pain after PEID, and the underlying mechanism of action. METHODS: Patients who underwent PEID for lumbar disc herniation (LDH) were enrolled and randomly assigned to the single surgery (SS) group, where disc removal was performed via PEID alone, or the combined treatment (CT) group, which received epidural injections of dexamethasone and VB12 alongside surgery. The outcome measures were the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), serum inflammatory factor expression, adverse surgical events, duration of postoperative hospitalization, and modified MacNab criteria. RESULTS: Compared with the SS group, the CT group exhibited lower VAS scores for low back and leg pain at 1, 3, and 7 days post-surgery (P < 0.05). JOA and ODI scores were significantly improved in the CT group than in the SS group 7 days post-surgery (P < 0.05); however, no significant differences were observed at other time points. Serum inflammatory factors were lower in the CT group than in the SS group 3 days post-surgery (P < 0.05). The duration of postoperative hospitalization was shorter in the CT group (P < 0.05). Both groups had similar good outcomes (89.3% vs. 92.2%, P = 0.945). CONCLUSIONS: Epidural injection of dexamethasone and VB12 effectively reduces early postoperative low back and leg pain, lowers postoperative inflammatory factor expression, and improves early PEID outcomes. Its clinical adoption merits consideration. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered with the China Clinical Trial Registration Center (Identifier: ChiCTR2400088854).",

This study aims to evaluate physicians' knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding Vitamin B12 screening and supplementation in this context. METHODS: A survey was administered to physicians across various specialties in government hospitals and primary care centers in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from January 2019 to January 2020. The survey assessed their knowledge, attitudes, and practices concerning Vitamin B12 deficiency screening and supplementation. RESULTS: Of the 402 participating physicians, 94.0% (378 respondents) demonstrated sufficient knowledge about Vitamin B12 deficiency. However, 26.1% believed that Vitamin B12 supplementation does not necessitate screening. 55.7% did not prescribe Vitamin B12 prophylactically, 41.5% omitted neurological examinations in patients presenting with neuropathy, and 22.4% were unaware of the recommended Vitamin B12 supplement dose. Only 49.8% routinely screened for Vitamin B12 deficiency in symptomatic patients. Physicians with more extended years of experience showed significantly better knowledge about Vitamin B12 screening and supplementation (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: While most physicians were knowledgeable about Vitamin B12 deficiency and supplementation, a substantial gap in translating this knowledge into practice was observed. There is a critical need for institutional oversight to ensure adherence to American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines for Vitamin B12 screening and supplementation in T2DM patients on long-term metformin therapy."

      "abstract": "Background Metformin is frequently prescribed as a first-line oral hypoglycemic drug to treat insulin resistance-causing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Long-term metformin use results in vitamin B12 deficiency, which is frequently overlooked and undiagnosed. A severe deficit may cause severe anemia and gastrointestinal, or neurological issues. Studies are scarce on this issue in Pakistani patients with T2DM. The current study aimed to estimate the prevalence of metformin-induced vitamin B12 deficiency in T2DM patients and to explore how it relates to metformin dosage or duration of therapy. Methodology A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on 260 T2DM patients using metformin therapy for more than a year and attending the outpatient diabetes clinic and the medicine department of Sheikh Zayed Hospital, Rahim Yar Khan, Pakistan, from August 2022 to October 2023. All socio-demographic, clinical, and general characteristics were collected. Blood samples were taken to measure the serum vitamin B12 levels, and based on these levels, deficient and normal group characteristics were compared. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23 (Released 2015; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States). Results Based on the serum levels of vitamin B12 of the studied T2DM on the metformin regimen, the overall prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency was found to be 36.54% (95). The B12 deficiency was higher among the age group of 41-50 years (109, 41.9%), female gender (150, 57.7%, p-value=0.0035), urban residents (194, 74.6%), non-smokers (197, 75.8%), and with a history of chronic disease (131, 50.4%). There was a statistically significant difference in vitamin B12 levels based on T2DM duration (p=0.012), with a higher prevalence in patients with a longer diabetes history of more than two years. There was no discernible statistical relationship between patients receiving different dosages of metformin (odds ratio (OR)=0.8627; 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.5195, 1.4326); p-value=0.568), durations of metformin (OR=0.7400; 95% CI (0.442, 1.2325); p-value=0.247), or intake of vitamin B12 (OR=0.8532; 95% CI (0.5073, 1.4351); p-value=0.549). Conclusion The prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency impacted more than one-third of T2DM patients using metformin (36.54%). The risk of vitamin B12 deficiency may increase in females with higher metformin dosages and longer durations of treatment. Furthermore, a statistically significant correlation exists between vitamin B12 deficiency and the longer duration of T2DM. These findings highlight the relevance of routinely monitoring serum levels of vitamin B12 among those with T2DM, especially when metformin is being given for over a year or at doses greater than 1000 mg per day. These preventive strategies will aid in the early detection of vitamin B12 deficiency, allowing patients to be treated with supplementation before problems such as anemia or neuropathies arise, resulting in improved quality of life and a lower socioeconomic burden."

Here, we report the case of a 48-year-old vegetarian male from South India who presented with jaundice, fatigue, and gastrointestinal discomfort. He was diagnosed with macrocytic anemia, mild hepatomegaly, and significant vitamin B12 deficiency. An incidental upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed multiple gastric nodules, later confirmed as a well-differentiated GNET. The patient also had a high hepatitis B viral load. He was treated with vitamin B12 supplementation and underwent resection of the tumor followed by antiviral therapy for hepatitis B. Postoperative recovery was uneventful with improvements in anemia and liver function. This case emphasizes the importance of a multidisciplinary approach and thorough evaluation when addressing patients with vitamin B12 insufficiency, hepatitis B, and GNET."

      "abstract": "Vitamin B12 (cobalamin; B12) is an essential micronutrient, but deficiency is common. The prompt diagnosis and treatment of B12 deficiency protects against megaloblastic anaemia, neuropathy and neuropsychiatric changes. Biomarkers of B12 status include the measurement of serum B12 (also known as total B12 or serum cobalamin), holotranscobalamin (holoTC or 'active B12'), methylmalonic acid (MMA) and total plasma homocysteine (Hcy). There is no 'gold standard' test for deficiency and the sensitivity and specificity of each biomarker for the evaluation of B12 status is affected by analytical and biological factors that may confer a high degree of diagnostic uncertainty. Limited access to technical and clinical expertise can lead to an over-reliance on the serum B12 test, which is readily available and highly automated. In some cases, the sequential use of different B12 status biomarkers or the calculation of a composite B12 status score, derived from a panel of B12 biomarkers and adjusted for folate status and age, can be used to detect deficient states that may otherwise be overlooked when using a single biomarker approach. This review summarizes the utility of B12-related biomarkers and describes approaches to their application and interpretation.",

      "abstract": "Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause a variety of diseases. The most common disease is macrocytic anemia, but it has also been found to be a cause of psychiatric disorders. The causes of deficiency are varied, and diagnosis is often difficult. Here, we report a patient who developed mental disorders due to vitamin B12 deficiency after total gastrectomy. A 37-year-old female, eight years after total gastrectomy, was withdrawn at her workplace, talking and acting abnormally. The family had seen unusual behavior for three days. The patient had no particular history of mental illness. The possibility of herpes encephalitis was suspected, and the patient was referred to our hospital, but there were no specific findings in the head on imaging examination. Blood tests showed no macrocytic anemia. Spinal fluid cytology and electroencephalography showed no specific findings, and herpes DNA was negative. Metabolic factors such as vitamin deficiency were considered, and intravenous vitamin replacement therapy was initiated. The psychiatric symptoms improved rapidly after vitamin B12 supplementation was started. On the fifth day of her hospitalization, it was discovered that her vitamin B12 level at the time of admission was extremely low. Typically, vitamin B12 deficiency is associated with macrocytic anemia, but in this patient, serum iron was also decreased, indicating a mixed anemia, making the diagnosis difficult. The patient had undergone a total gastrectomy for gastric cancer eight years ago, and the psychiatric symptoms were thought to be due to impaired vitamin B12 absorption caused by intrinsic factor deficiency. Since then, oral replacement therapy and intramuscular injection have been continued without recurrence of symptoms. Disturbances of consciousness may have many causes, but when there is a history of gastrectomy, we should also consider vitamin B12 deficiency when examining patients."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The identification of vitamin B12 (B12) deficiency in the newborn may prevent neurological damage and a delay in the normal growth. In this study we characterized the incidence of B12 deficiency in newborns, the costs associated to the clinical diagnosis and management, and the relevance to optimize the use of cobalamin biomarkers during treatment follow-up. METHODS: Starting from a continuous case series of 146,470 screened newborns (November, 1st 2021- December, 3rd 2023), the Regional Reference Laboratory for Neonatal Screening identified 87 newborns having altered levels of biomarkers of cobalamin metabolism measured by newborn screening. These subjects were confirmed with a nutritional B12 deficiency of maternal origin by performing the serum B12 measurements and plasma homocysteine (Hcy) both on the newborns and respective mothers. A cost analysis was performed to characterize the costs/year of identifying and managing B12 deficiency cases. RESULTS: At baseline, median (interquartile range) serum B12 levels of 185.0 (142.3-246.0) ng/L and threefold increased plasma Hcy concentrations above the normal level confirmed a severe condition of deficiency in the newborns. After intramuscular B12 supplementation, serum B12 measured at the first follow up visit showed a fivefold increase, and the levels of Hcy returned to normal. From the healthcare perspective, the costs for diagnosing and managing all newborns with B12 deficiency is 188,480 €/year. CONCLUSIONS: Preventing B12 depletion in newborns lowers healthcare costs and likely improves their health outcomes. Further studies are however required to address the clinical pathway to identify, treat and monitor pregnant women with marginal and low B12 status, in order to achieve these goals.",

It severely affects maternal and fetal health. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of anemia and its association with iron and vitamin B12 deficiency during pregnancy. Materials and methods The study sample consisted of pregnant women attending the 3rd Clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University General Hospital \"Attikon\", Athens, Greece, with a total of 145 women eventually analyzed. Blood samples were collected from pregnant women during the first, second, and third trimesters; hematological indices, including hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), red blood cell distribution width (RDW), ferritin, and vitamin B12, were recorded. Iron deficiency anemia was defined as HGB <11.0 g/dl in the first trimester and <10.5 g/dl in the second and third trimesters. Results Iron deficiency anemia is elevated in the course of pregnancy. A significant proportion of pregnant women had vitamin B12 deficiency during pregnancy, with the prevalence increasing from the first to the third trimester. The study also found that iron supplementation improved hematological indices; especially, pregnant women receiving divalent iron had significantly higher levels of HCT, HGB, and ferritin compared to those receiving trivalent iron. Conclusions Screening for iron deficiency anemia should be performed in all pregnant women, and appropriate oral iron therapy should be given as first-line treatment. Early recognition and management of low maternal iron levels are crucial and lead to improved maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes. Furthermore, unified international thresholds for ID are required for accurate assessments and appropriate iron supplementing. This study also recommends the screening of vitamin B12 levels as part of the systematic follow-up of pregnant women to identify potential deficiencies and provide appropriate supplementation. Further in-depth studies, particularly related to vitamin B12, are required to provide definitive conclusions and guidance."

METHODS: This study utilized data from two cycles (2011-2012, 2013-2014) of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to investigate this relationship. The researchers constructed a 41-item frailty index encompassing diverse aspects of physical functioning, psychological evaluation, and medical conditions, and evaluated each participant individually. The study utilized Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and univariate ordered logistic regression to assess the relationships between variables and cognitive frailty. Recursive feature elimination and cross-validation methods were employed to identify the most influential variables for building and optimizing multivariate ordered logistic regression models. Subgroup analyses and interaction tests were further conducted to validate the identified correlations. RESULTS: The findings of this study confirm a negative linear correlation between 25-(OH)D levels and cognitive frailty in older adults. Specifically, a one-unit increase in 25-(OH)D levels was associated with a 12% reduction in the risk of cognitive frailty. The result was further supported by subgroup analyses and interaction tests. CONCLUSION: The existence of a negatively correlated linear association between 25-(OH)D levels and cognitive frailty in older adults is plausible, but further rigorously designed longitudinal studies are necessary to validate this relationship."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to understand the role of vitamin B12 supplementation in improving skeletal muscle function among the elderly. METHODS: A literature review in the Medline database was conducted to understand the association between vitamin B12 and muscle function in Section A. In Section B, 28 healthy elderly participants aged ≥60 years were recruited in a cross-sectional design for estimation of plasma vitamin B12 status and assessment of upper limb muscle strength Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and muscle quality (expressed as MVC/total muscle mass). Participants were grouped based on vitamin B12 status into vitamin B12-depleted (<148 pmol/L) and replete (≥148 pmol/L) groups. In a quasi-experimental study design, the vitamin B12-depleted group (n = 14) received daily oral vitamin B12 supplementation of 100 μg for 3 months. All the study measures were repeated post-supplementation. RESULTS: Vitamin B12 deficiency was identified to contribute adversely to muscle strength, quality, and physical performance among older people in the extensive literature review. The pilot intervention study showed significant improvement in MVC and muscle quality (p < 0.050) post-vitamin B12 supplementation, comparable to the vitamin B12-replete group. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin B12 may have a crucial role in the maintenance of muscle function. 3-month oral vitamin B12 supplementation among subclinical vitamin B12 deficient elderly improved muscle strength and quality and reached levels similar to the vitamin B12 replete group."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pediatric palliative care (PPC) patients are at an elevated risk of malnutrition. Nutritional inadequacy can also cause micronutrient deficiencies. These factors can lead to weight loss, stunted growth, and poor quality of life. Despite the prevalence of these issues, limited research exists in the micronutrient status of PPC patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the vitamin B12 and D, iron, ferritin, folate, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium levels of PPC patients to contribute to a better understanding of their micronutrient needs as well as the appropriate management of diet and treatment approaches. METHODS: This was a single-center observational cross-sectional retrospective study. This study evaluated the levels of vitamin B12, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, iron, ferritin, folate, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium in PPC patients. The patients were classified according to the Chronic Complex Conditions (CCC) v2 and then compared. RESULTS: A total of 3,144 micronutrient data points were collected from 822 hospitalizations of 364 patients. At least one micronutrient deficiency was identified in 96.9% of the patients. The most prevalent deficiencies were observed for iron, calcium, and phosphate. In addition, 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency was observed in one-third of patients. Calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, folate, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were negatively correlated with age. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that micronutrient deficiencies are highly prevalent in PPC patients. These findings have the potential to contribute to improvements in the nutritional and therapeutic management of patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic alcoholism refers to the unpleasant symptoms directly resulting from excessive drinking. Increased alcohol metabolites and an unbalanced oxidative state are likely to blame for the reported effects under these circumstances. According to preclinical and clinical research, vitamin B12 can act on several organ systems with demonstrated neuroprotective, antioxidant, and glutamate modulating properties. OBJECTIVE: This research sought to examine the ameliorative effects of vitamin B12 (VtB12) in persistent alcohol (AlOH) exposed adult zebrafish with the help of following parameters like the anxiety related behavior test, Oxidative stress, and antioxidant assays, histological and immunofluorescence analysis. METHODS: Zebrafish pretreated with 0.40% AlOH (v/v) for 120 min (+AlOH) or not (-AlOH), were exposed for 6 h to home tank water (-VtB12) or to 59 µg-VtB12/kg-fish food (+VtB12) to analyze anxiety behavior in the geotaxis (novel tank) test as well as the oxidative brain damage in the adult zebrafish. RESULTS: Adult zebrafish exposed to chronic AlOH showed a decrease in the distance travelled, average and mobility speed, and increased the average frozen time, the explored area, and total no. of the site explored in the trapezoid tank. AlOH exposure also resulted in oxidative damage, enhanced lipid peroxidation, advanced oxidative protein products, decreased enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant activities, and enhanced reactive oxygen species generation. Additionally, VtB12 supplementation improved neurogenesis, evident in increased Nissl cell numbers and NeuN expression in the brain. CONCLUSION: Chronic alcoholism may be effect on the brain cells as well as on the neuro-behavior of zebrafish. This research demonstrated that VtB12 shows promise as a neuroprotective agent against chronic alcoholism induced alterations in zebrafish's brain."

      "abstract": "This extensive review delves into the complex relationship between prolonged use of metformin and the possible emergence of vitamin B12 deficiency (VB12D) in diabetic patients. Metformin, a pivotal element in diabetes management, is constantly linked with decreased absorption of vitamin B12, prompting concerns about the enduring consequences of this interaction. The review systematically amalgamates current evidence, elucidating the prevalence, mechanisms, and clinical ramifications of VB12D induced by consistent consumption of metformin. Exploring the different pathways through which metformin might disrupt the absorption of Vitamin B12, the review encompasses interference with the calcium-dependent membrane activity and alterations of the microbiota present in the gut. A meticulous analysis of experimental studies and human trials is undertaken, accentuating the prevalence of variable VB12D among individuals on long-duration treatment of metformin across diverse populations and age groups. Clinical indications of cobalamin deficiency, spanning haematological abnormalities to neurological complications, are systematically examined. Furthermore, the review delves into the potential implications of cobalamin deficiency associated with metformin on diabetes-related complications and overall patient health. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the intricate interplay between the use of metformin and deficiency of vitamin B12 in diabetic patients, emphasizing the importance that lies in routine monitoring, early detection, and personalized interventions to optimize the long-period safety and efficiency of metformin in the treatment of diabetes. It also proposes future research directions to refine clinical guidelines and enhance the understanding regarding the correlation between diabetes, metformin, and vitamin B12."

      "abstract": "Pancytopenia is a complex medical condition characterized by decreased levels of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs). It can arise from impaired production, peripheral destruction, or a combination of both. The causes of pancytopenia range from reversible factors like infections and medication reactions to irreversible conditions. Vitamin B12 deficiency is a notable reversible cause that can take years to manifest in adults due to stored reserves. However, deficiencies caused by impaired absorption, especially due to the lack of intrinsic factors (IFs), can lead to rapid deterioration within two to five years. A healthy 39-year-old male with an athletic lifestyle presented with symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, and fainting over a few days. These symptoms were preceded by weeks of persistent body aches, headaches, weakness, daily fevers, chills, and night sweats. Vital signs were stable. The physical examination revealed conjunctival pallor and lymphadenopathy in the submandibular and superficial cervical regions. Initial blood tests showed normocytic anemia (Hgb 4.9, MCV 80), leukopenia (2.99), thrombocytopenia (142), and elevated liver enzymes (AST 199, ALT 96, and total bilirubin of 2.04). The peripheral smear showed tear-drop cells and hypochromic cells. The initial impression was hematologic malignancy, including but not limited to leukemia, lymphoma, or myelofibrosis given clinical findings such as B-symptoms like night sweats, neck lymphadenopathy, and subjective daily fever, along with pancytopenia. The patient received a bolus of normal saline and a transfusion of two units of packed RBCs. CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed no adenopathy or splenomegaly. Although initial clinical assessment pointed toward a potential hematologic malignancy, comprehensive testing, including SPEP, reticulocyte count/fraction, serum folate, and serum vitamin B12, revealed only severe vitamin B12 deficiency, with a level of less than 150, with the presence of IF antibodies. Treatment involved intensive in-patient vitamin B12 injections followed by a detailed outpatient regimen. The patient completed a daily dose of vitamin B12 injections for seven consecutive days, followed by weekly injections for the next four weeks. Subsequent laboratory results demonstrated an increase in WBC count to 8.39, Hgb level to 13.2, and PLT count of 249, indicating a continued positive response to the vitamin B12 replacement therapy. In summary, pancytopenia poses a diagnostic challenge that demands careful evaluation of patient data and comprehensive testing. Vitamin B12 deficiency, which encompasses pernicious anemia (PA), is among the reversible factors to consider. This aspect holds significance before opting for more invasive measures like a bone marrow biopsy. Nutritional deficiencies need to be considered first as differentials in pancytopenia, even in the absence of typical signs of vitamin B12 deficiency (like macrocytosis and hypersegmented neutrophils) and in the presence of compelling clinical indications pointing to a hematologic malignancy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have shown that the levodopa treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) elevates circulating homocysteine levels, which are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and neurological disorders, or thrombosis. The present trial aimed to examine whether the intake of vitamin B12, folic acid, and vitamin D3 supplements improved homocysteine level and quality of life (QoL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: An interventional prospective trial was conducted in multiple centers across Romania. Participants with clinically established PD taking at least 300 mg/day of levodopa for more than 1 year received a daily tablet of a supplement containing 800 UI of vitamin D3, 1000 µg of folic acid, and 15 µg of vitamin B12. They were followed for 6 months and their serum homocysteine, vitamin B12, vitamin D, and QoL scores were measured at baseline and at 6 months of treatment. QoL was measured using a 15D questionnaire, which assesses mobility, vision, hearing, breathing, sleeping, eating, speech, excretion, usual activities, mental function, discomfort and symptoms, depression, distress, vitality, and sexual activity. RESULTS: Twenty-four PD patients with a mean age of 71 ± 5.04 years (54.2% male and 45.8% female) finished the study. After the intervention, the mean score of speech, mental function, discomfort and symptoms, depression, and QoL significantly increased (p < 0.05 for all). Also, the serum homocysteine and vitamin D were significantly enhanced (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.025, respectively). Changes in vitamin B12 were not statistically significant at 6 months of treatment (p = 0.996). No gender differences were found among the changes that we have demonstrated for homocysteine, vitamin B12, vitamin D, and QoL levels (p < 0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study showed that the dietary intake of vitamin B12, folic acid, and vitamin D3 remarkably decreased the dimensions of homocysteine and finally increased the total score of QoL in PD patients. We have successfully captured the potential benefits of the supplementation regimen over time and provided insights into the broader implications for managing PD with a focus on nutritional support."

Consideration of a gluten-free diet in similar cases can lead to significant clinical improvement. ABSTRACT: Celiac disease, characterized by its diverse clinical manifestations, often necessitates adherence to a gluten-free diet, particularly in pediatric patients for optimal growth and development. This report presents the case of an 11-year-old male who exhibited recurrent symptoms of fever and diarrhea progressing to edema and pallor, with a history dating back to age 3. Laboratory findings revealed pancytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, and proteinuria. Despite negative serological markers, noninvasive tests, along with clinical improvement on a gluten-free diet and supportive measures within a month, suggested celiac disease complicated by transient protein-losing enteropathy and vitamin B12 deficiency. It is important to note that other malabsorption disorders can also show clinical improvement following a gluten-free diet. Additionally, the antibiotic treatment received by the patient could have addressed other possible causes of malabsorption, complicating the differential diagnosis. This case highlights the importance of early recognition and management of celiac disease, especially in pediatric patients, to prevent complications and promote optimal health outcomes."

Its clinical manifestations are multiple and unspecific, encompassing hematological problems and neurodevelopmental consequences. Positive diagnosis and early treatment with vitamin B12 supplementation have a rapidly reversible effect on symptoms. Delayed diagnosis, however, may result in irreversible neurological sequelae. We report the case of a six-month-old infant, admitted with hypotonia and psychomotor regression since the age of four months. The laboratory work-up revealed macrocytic anemia with the presence of megakaryocytes and megaloblasts on the myelogram. Vitamin B12 levels were low, and homocysteine levels were high. A maternal workup showed vitamin B12 deficiency in the mother. A brain MRI showed bilateral frontoparietal cortical atrophy. The patient was put on vitamin B12 supplementation with good evolution. The aim of our work is to shed light on the misleading and varied clinical profile of vitamin B12 deficiency in an exclusively breastfed infant, the serious consequences of maternal vitamin B12 deficiency, and the importance of early diagnosis of this condition."

      "abstract": "AIM: The etiology of telogen effluvium (TE) includes situations that may cause physiological stress, surgical trauma, inflammatory, infectious, iatrogenic causes, medications and nutritional deficiencies. TE has been associated with iron deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency and thyroid diseases. In recent years, the use of over-the-counter food supplements containing vitamins and minerals such as biotin, vitamin D, zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and selenium (Se) has been increasing in TE patients. The aim of this study is to investigate whether there are differences in nutritional status, vitamin and mineral levels by comparing individuals with TE and a control group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This case-control study included 90 female patients diagnosed with chronic telogen effluvium (CTE), and 90 female controls volunteered to participate in the study who consulted for reasons other than TE. Both groups aged 18 and over and applied to dermatology polyclinic between 01.09.2022 and 01.09.2023. A detailed anamnesis was taken from all patients, a hair pull test was performed, and TE was diagnosed after a dermoscopic examination was performed on all areas of the scalp. Then, serum vitamin D, Zn, Cu, Se levels and biotin levels in serum and urine were measured. Hemoglobin (Hb), ferritin, vitamin B12 and thyroid function tests were retrospectively scanned from the hospital database. RESULTS: It was determined that Zn levels were significantly lower in CTE patients than in controls. Se levels were found to be significantly higher in patients than in controls. There was no difference in Hb, ferritin, vitamin B12, thyroid function tests, vitamin D, Cu levels, serum and urine biotin levels between the two groups. Zn, Cu/Zn and Se levels were found to have statistically significant diagnostic performance in predicting the diagnosis of CTE. Cu/Zn ratio and Se value were found to be significant predictors of CTE. CONCLUSION: This study shows us that nutritional deficiencies are not as common as thought in patients diagnosed with TE. Other causes that may cause TE should be investigated by a detailed anamnesis and a good physical examination. After all, tests for suspected conditions should be performed and individualized treatment options should be created for each patient.",

      "abstract": "Metformin is the most widely used antihyperglycemic drug in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Over the past 2 decades, several studies have highlighted a substantial increase in the risk of vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with T2D on metformin therapy. This can lead to several complications and induce or exacerbate peripheral neuropathy. Despite these data, there are no definite guidelines for screening, diagnosing, and treating vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with T2D on metformin therapy. Therefore, in this narrative review, we aimed to suggest a practical diagnostic and therapeutic strategy to address vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with T2D receiving metformin treatment. Clinical evidence supporting an increased risk of vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with T2D on metformin therapy and its risk factors and potential complications are also discussed."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Vitamin B12 deficiency is primarily associated with pernicious anaemia, polyneuropathy, and spinal-cord disease, but publications on its association with hallucinations are on the rise. METHODS: I carried out a systematic literature search on these hallucinations in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar, up until July 1, 2023. RESULTS: The search yielded 50 case studies published between 1960 and 2023. The hallucinations described therein are predominantly visual and/or auditory in nature, with 20% being specified as complex, compound, or panoramic. They are often described in the context of vitamin B12-related neuropsychiatric conditions such as dementia, delirium, epilepsy, psychotic disorder, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, depressive disorder, catatonia, or obsessive-compulsive disorder. In the context of such disorders, they tend to appear first and also often appear to be the first to disappear with cobalamin treatment. Within an average of 2 months, full amelioration was thus obtained in 75% of the cases and partial amelioration in the remaining 25%. Remarkably, a quarter of the cases involved therapy-resistant hallucinations that fully resolved under cobalamin monotherapy, while other neuropsychiatric manifestations of vitamin B12 deficiency disappeared in 60% of the treated cases. Only 32% of the cases involved comorbid pernicious anaemia. This suggests that two separate or diverging pathways exist for perceptual and haematological symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency. CONCLUSION: In the light of the high prevalence rate of vitamin B12 deficiency in the general population, the findings here presented should be interpreted with great caution. Nonetheless, they offer cues for further research and experimental application in clinical practice. This may be especially relevant in light of the recent increase in the popularity of vegetarianism and the recreational use of nitrous oxide (laughing gas), which are both risk factors for vitamin B12 deficiency.",

      "abstract": "Developmental delay is a multifaceted condition that can hamper a child's ability to attain developmental benchmarks within expected timelines. Vitamin B12 deficiency has been identified as a potentially reversible causative factor and is critical to neurological function, influencing myelination and nerve conduction. Insufficiency during critical developmental stages can lead to motor, cognitive, and language delays. Physiotherapy interventions have been found effective in addressing motor delays associated with both developmental delay and B12 deficiency. Early intervention programs that focus on motor skill development, sensory integration, and adaptive equipment use are among the interventions that physiotherapists provide. Collaboration with multidisciplinary teams allows physiotherapists to manage B12 deficiency effectively and provide rehabilitative strategies aimed at maximizing motor function and overall development for long-term health. Early identification and intervention in children with developmental delays is crucial, especially in cases related to vitamin B12 deficiency. Physiotherapy is a critical aspect of addressing motor delays associated with developmental delay and B12 deficiency. By providing early interventions, physiotherapists can help children attain their full potential and attain developmental milestones. In conclusion, this highlights the significance of early identification and intervention in children with developmental delay, especially those with vitamin B12 deficiency, for optimal long-term health."

She had a history of severe peripheral neuropathy that was managed with vitamin B12-containing tablets approximately three years before presenting with progressive loss of vision. On examination, she had no perception of light in the left eye and no perception of hand motion in the right eye. The fundus in her left eye had mild blurring of disc margins. Results from tests done showed a haemoglobin of 12.9g/dl, MCV 101fl, a serum vitamin B12 of 78pmol/l, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) test showed no active disease. She was diagnosed with optic neuritis and started on 30 mg tablets of prednisolone for 1 week with slight improvement. She was then started on vitamin B12 injections 1 mg daily for 10 days and thereafter, monthly for 6 months. She reported gradual improvement and regained her sight after 5 months treatment of with Vitamin B12 injections. Ophthalmic manifestations of vitamin B12 deficiency are not common and may present without haematological signs therefore, a high index of suspicion is required for early diagnosis and management of vitamin B12 deficiency.",

      "abstract": "The escalating use of nanodiamonds (NDs) has raised concerns about their ecotoxicological impact, prompting exploration of therapeutic interventions. This paper pioneers the examination of Vitamin B12-conjugated sericin (VB12-SER) as a potential therapeutic approach against ND-induced toxicity in darkling beetles (Blaps polychresta). The study analyzes mortality rates and organ-specific effects, covering the testis, ovary, and midgut, before and after treatments. Following exposure to 10 mg NDs/g body weight, within a subgroup of individuals termed ND2 with a mortality rate below 50%, two therapeutic treatments were administered, including pure sericin (SER) at 10 mg/mL and VB12-SER at 10.12 mg/mL. Consequently, five experimental groups (control, SER, ND2, ND2+SER, ND2+SER+VB12) were considered. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to assess the lifespan distribution of the insects in these groups over a 30-d period. Analyses revealed increased mortality and significant abnormalities induced by NDs within the examined organs, including cell death, DNA damage, enzyme dysregulation, antioxidant imbalances, protein depletion, lipid peroxidation, and morphological deformities. In contrast, the proposed treatments, especially (ND2+SER+VB12), demonstrated remarkable recovery, highlighting VB12-conjugated SER's potential in mitigating ND-triggered adverse effects. Molecular docking simulations affirmed binding stability and favorable interactions of the VB12-SER complex with target proteins. This research enhances understanding of NDs' effects on B. polychresta, proposing it as an effective bioindicator, and introduces VB12-conjugated SER as a promising therapeutic strategy in nanotoxicological studies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It is difficult to recognize vitamin B12 deficiency and to evaluate the effect of B12 treatment due to a broad range of variable clinical symptoms overlapping with other diseases and diagnostic biomarkers that quickly normalize during treatment. This poses a risk of delay in diagnosis and a challenge to uniformly monitor the effect of B12 treatment. There is a need for a new clinical outcome measure suitable for clinical practice and clinical evaluation studies. OBJECTIVE: To develop a Patient-Reported Outcome Measure (PROM) which measures the severity of vitamin B12 deficiency symptoms. METHODS: The B12 PROM was developed by (1) gathering input from experts and literature review to define a construct and develop a conceptual model, (2) processing input from health care providers, scientists, and patients to develop items and response options, and (3) improving items based on the feedback from laypersons, test interviews, semi-structured cognitive interviews with patients, and forward and backward translation (ENG-NL). RESULTS: The B12 PROM includes 62 items grouped into 8 categories of symptoms related to vitamin B12 deficiency (General, Senses, Thinking, In limbs and/or face, Movement, Emotions, Mouth & Abdomen, Urinary tract & Reproductive organs). Cognitive interviews demonstrated good comprehensibility and comprehensiveness. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first step in the development of a disease-specific PROM for vitamin B12 deficiency to measure the burden of symptoms. Further validation and reliability testing are necessary before the PROM can be applied in clinical practice and research.",

Especially in elderly patients, vitamin B12 deficiency can be easily overlooked because symptoms may be attributed to comorbid conditions or solely to the aging process. In this case study, we present two patients, a 71-year-old man and a 74-year-old female, with vitamin B12 deficiency. The male patient had a history of (partial) resection of the ileum/jejunum/colon because of intestinal ischemia. The female patient had a history of hypothyroidism, type 2 diabetes with complications (including peripheral neuropathy), mitochondrial myopathy, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Both patients presented with severe fatigue, cognitive impairment, and impaired walking. Next to this, the male patient suffered from depressive symptoms and mild disorientation, and the female patient experienced neuropathic pain. She also mentioned a positive family history for B12 deficiency. The first patient had normal to high B12 levels because he was already on B12 injections (once every three weeks) because of an earlier diagnosed B12 deficiency. The female patient had B12 levels within normal range (holotranscobalamin 54 pmol/L) and her diagnosis was confirmed by elevated homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels. Treatment with frequent hydroxocobalamin injections and other supplements significantly improved their cognitive, emotional, and motor functions. These cases underscore the need for a high level of clinical suspicion in elderly patients, also in cases of normal B12 levels but with clinical signs of deficiency and a positive risk factor, such as stomach or small bowel surgery or positive family history.",

This misalignment can lead to underdiagnosis in younger populations, with potential long-term health implications. CASE SUMMARY: Chief Complaint: The 17-year-old female patient experienced severe fatigue, menstrual irregularities, psychological distress, and neurological symptoms over several years. The 13-year-old male patient had behavioral changes, gastrointestinal complaints, and sensory disturbances from an early age.Diagnosis: Both adolescents displayed B12 levels that were considered low-normal based on adult thresholds, complicating their diagnostic processes. Their diverse and atypical symptomatology required a comprehensive review of their medical and family histories, clinical symptoms, and risk factors.Intervention: Treatment included administration of hydroxocobalamin injections, complemented by dietary adjustments.Outcome: Both patients responded well to the treatment, showing significant improvements in their symptoms and overall quality of life. CONCLUSION: The main takeaway from these cases is the importance of tailoring diagnostic adequate thresholds and treatment plans to the pediatric population to address and manage B12 deficiency effectively. This approach can significantly enhance patient outcomes and prevent the progression of potentially severe complications in later life.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adult vitamin B12 (B12) deficiency may present itself with nonspecific mainly neurological symptoms, and thus plasma biomarkers are often judged to be of major importance in the further diagnostic process. Four biomarkers are of special relevance: total B12, holotranscobalamin (the part of B12 bound to the active transport protein, transcobalamin, also named holoTC or active B12) and the 2 so-called metabolic markers that accumulate if B12 is lacking, methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine. OBJECTIVE: This article briefly reviews the inherent limitation of biomarkers, discusses its use in establishing the diagnosis and cause of B12 deficiency, and when following or discontinuing treatment with B12. METHODS: The review is based on published papers, but also on knowledge gained from working within the area. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that a combination of a B12 and a metabolic marker, for example, total B12 and MMA, may prove most useful in daily practice. An unexpectedly high level of total B12 is most often of no clinical importance, though sometimes related to the presence of underlying cancer. Measurement of total B12 is of limited value in patients on treatment with pharmacological doses of B12 but may be helpful if B12 treatment is discontinued.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the 1940s to 1950s, high-dose folic acid supplements (>5 mg/d) were used clinically to reverse the megaloblastic anemia of vitamin B12 deficiency caused by pernicious anemia. However, this treatment strategy masked the underlying B12 deficiency and possibly exacerbated its neuropathological progression. The issue of masking and exacerbating B12 deficiency has recently been rekindled with the institution of folic acid fortification and the wide-spread use of folic acid supplements. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this review are to describe clinical and epidemiological evidence that excess folic acid exacerbates B12 deficiency, to summarize a hypothesis to explain this phenomenon, and to provide guidance for clinicians. RESULTS: Cognitive function test scores are lower and blood homocysteine and methylmalonic acid concentrations are higher in people with low B12 and elevated folate than in those with low B12 and nonelevated folate. High-dose folic acid supplementation in patients with pernicious anemia or epilepsy cause significant reductions in serum B12. It is hypothesized that high-dose folic acid supplements cause depletion of serum holotranscobalamin and thus exacerbate B12 deficiency. CONCLUSION: The evidence for excess folic acid exacerbating B12 deficiency is primarily correlative or from uncontrolled clinical observations, and the hypothesis to explain the phenomenon has not yet been tested. Nonetheless, the evidence is sufficiently compelling to warrant increased vigilance for identifying B12 deficiency in at risk individuals, including older adults and others with low B12 intake or conditions that are associated with B12 malabsorption, who also ingest excessive folic acid or are prescribed folic acid in high doses.",

This case report details a 53-year-old female who presented with significant weight loss, watery diarrhea, and jaundice. Laboratory investigations revealed pancytopenia, hemolysis, and schistocytes, initially suggesting a diagnosis of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). However, significantly low vitamin B12 levels and subsequent bone marrow examination confirmed pernicious anemia with megaloblastic changes. This case underscores the importance of considering vitamin B12 deficiency in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with TMA-like symptoms. Early recognition and treatment with vitamin B12 supplementation led to rapid clinical improvement and the resolution of symptoms. This report highlights the need for heightened clinical awareness of atypical presentations of pernicious anemia to prevent misdiagnosis and ensure timely, effective treatment."

However, its benefits in terms of perioperative and long-term outcomes remain controversial. The aim of this study was to compare the perioperative, body compositional, nutritional, and survival outcomes of patients undergoing proximal gastrectomy with double-tract reconstruction (PG-DTR) and TG for pathological stage I gastric cancer in upper stomach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 506 patients who underwent gastrectomy for pathological stage I gastric cancer in the upper stomach between 2015 and 2019. Clinicopathological, perioperative, body compositional, nutritional, and survival outcomes were compared between the PG-DTR and TG groups. RESULTS: The PG-DTR and TG groups included 197 (38.9%) and 309 (61.1%) patients, respectively. The PG-DTR group had a lower rate of early complications (p=0.041), lower diagnosis rate of anemia and vitamin B12 deficiency (all p < 0.001), and lower replacement rate of iron and vitamin B12 compared to TG group (all p < 0.001). The PG-DTR group showed reduced incidence of sarcopenia at 6-months postoperatively, preserved higher amount of visceral fat after surgery (p=0.032 and p=0.040, respectively), and showed a higher hemoglobin level (p=0.007). Oncologic outcomes were comparable between the groups. CONCLUSION: The PG-DTR for EGC located in the upper stomach offered advantages of fewer complications, lower incidence of anemia and vitamin B12 deficiency, less decrease in visceral fat volume, and similar survival compared to TG. Consequently, PG-DTR may be considered a superior alternative treatment option to TG.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Metformin is one of the primary pharmacologic agents for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, it has been associated with interference in vitamin B12 absorption and deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency and T2DM can present diagnostic challenges for polyneuropathy. Diagnosis is essential for guiding treatment, yet the use of vitamin B12 level testing in this population may have dwindled over time amid changing practice guidelines. This study examines trends over time in the use of vitamin B12 level testing among patients on metformin. METHODS: This retrospective trend analysis used data from TriNetX, a real-world, longitudinal clinical database. Patients treated with metformin from 2000 to 2020 were identified using Rx Concept Unique Identifier codes. The number of patients who underwent vitamin B12 level testing at any time after 1 month from metformin initiation was tabulated. Patients were grouped by the year of B12 level testing. Trends in B12 level testing were assessed using the Jonckheere-Terpstra statistical test (P<.05). RESULTS: Out of 4,203,020 patients prescribed metformin, 1,055,995 (25.1%) underwent B12 level testing. The highest proportion of patients tested was in 2000 to 2002 (39.6%), while the lowest proportion was in 2018 to 2020 (20.1%). B12 testing utilization declined significantly by 19.5% from 2000-2002 to 2018-2020 (P=.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that the use of vitamin B12 level testing in patients on metformin has significantly declined over the years, potentially impacting early detection of B12 deficiency. Future studies with more granular data from real-life practice are recommended to understand the precise reasons and impact of this trend."

      "abstract": "The enduring relationship between humanity and the cannabis plant has witnessed significant transformations, particularly with the widespread legalization of medical cannabis. This has led to the recognition of diverse pharmacological formulations of medical cannabis, containing 545 identified natural compounds, including 144 phytocannabinoids like Δ9-THC and CBD. Cannabinoids exert distinct regulatory effects on physiological processes, prompting their investigation in neurodegenerative diseases. Recent research highlights their potential in modulating protein aggregation and mitochondrial dysfunction, crucial factors in conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease, multiple sclerosis, or Parkinson's disease. The discussion emphasizes the importance of maintaining homeodynamics in neurodegenerative disorders and explores innovative therapeutic approaches such as nanoparticles and RNA aptamers. Moreover, cannabinoids, particularly CBD, demonstrate anti-inflammatory effects through the modulation of microglial activity, offering multifaceted neuroprotection including mitigating aggregation. Additionally, the potential integration of cannabinoids with vitamin B12 presents a holistic framework for addressing neurodegeneration, considering their roles in homeodynamics and nervous system functioning including the hippocampal neurogenesis. The potential synergistic therapeutic benefits of combining CBD with vitamin B12 underscore a promising avenue for advancing treatment strategies in neurodegenerative diseases. However, further research is imperative to fully elucidate their effects and potential applications, emphasizing the dynamic nature of this field and its potential to reshape neurodegenerative disease treatment paradigms."

Recently, scientific evidence has supported the potential therapeutic effects of four combined natural molecules-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), folic acid, vitamin B12 and hyaluronic acid (HA)-in counteracting HPV DNA positivity and related cytological lesions. Methods: Each patient of these five clinical cases had persistent HPV positivity in the anogenital site and assumed a dietary supplement based on a combination of 200 mg of EGCG, 50 mg of HA, 1 mg of vitamin B12 and 400 mcg of folic acid (Pervistop®, Farmares s.r.l., Rome, Italy) at a dosage of 1 or 2 caps/day for 6 or 3 months, respectively, depending on clinical history. Results: After treatment, all the patients reported a negative HPV DNA test and improved cytological lesions, thus demonstrating the ability of these combined molecules to counteract both anal and cervical HPV infection and related manifestations. Conclusions: Overall, these data corroborate previous evidence about the effectiveness of such natural molecules in the management of HPV infection and its persistence. Naturally, further studies with a larger population and long-term follow-up will contribute to reinforce the positive effects of this dietary supplement in counteracting HPV infection."

      "abstract": "Vitamin B12 is critical for hematopoiesis and myelination. Deficiency can cause neurologic deficits including loss of coordination and cognitive decline. However, diagnosis relies on measurement of vitamin B12 in the blood, which may not accurately reflect the concentration in the brain. Using programmable phage display, we identified an autoantibody targeting the transcobalamin receptor (CD320) in a patient with progressive tremor, ataxia, and scanning speech. Anti-CD320 impaired cellular uptake of cobalamin (B12) in vitro by depleting its target from the cell surface. Despite a normal serum concentration, B12 was nearly undetectable in her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Immunosuppressive treatment and high-dose systemic B12 supplementation were associated with increased B12 in the CSF and clinical improvement. Optofluidic screening enabled isolation of a patient-derived monoclonal antibody that impaired B12 transport across an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Autoantibodies targeting the same epitope of CD320 were identified in seven other patients with neurologic deficits of unknown etiology, 6% of healthy controls, and 21.4% of a cohort of patients with neuropsychiatric lupus. In 132 paired serum and CSF samples, detection of anti-CD320 in the blood predicted B12 deficiency in the brain. However, these individuals did not display any hematologic signs of B12 deficiency despite systemic CD320 impairment. Using a genome-wide CRISPR screen, we found that the low-density lipoprotein receptor serves as an alternative B12 uptake pathway in hematopoietic cells. These findings dissect the tissue specificity of B12 transport and elucidate an autoimmune neurologic condition that may be amenable to immunomodulatory treatment and nutritional supplementation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Kawasaki Disease (KD) is a pediatric vasculitic disorder characterized by systemic small vasculitis, notably coronary arteritis, with unclear pathogenesis. This explorative case-control study investigated the association between folic acid (FA), vitamin D3 (VD3), and vitamin B12 (VB12) levels and the different types of Kawasaki Disease, as well as the incidence of coronary artery lesions (CALs). METHODS: In this explorative case control study, 365 KD children admitted to our hospital from January 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023 were included as the KD group. Simultaneously, 365 healthy children who received physical examination during the same period were included as the control group. The KD group was divided into typical KD group and incomplete KD group (IKD group), CALs group and non-CALS group, and IVIG sensitive group and IVIG resistant group. The children with CALs were divided into small tumor group, medium tumor group and large tumor group. Serum levels of FA, VB12, and VD3 were compared across all groups. RESULTS: Serum levels of FA and VD3 were significantly decreased in both the KD and CALs groups (p < 0.05), and both factors were identified as independent risk factors for KD and CALs. Similarly, reduced serum VD3 levels were observed in the IKD and IVIG-resistant groups (p < 0.05), with VD3 also being an independent risk factor for both IKD and IVIG resistance. Additionally, lower serum FA levels were noted in the group with large aneurysms (p < 0.05), establishing FA as an independent risk factor for aneurysm size. CONCLUSION: Serum levels of folic FA and vitamin VD3 were significantly reduced in children with KD. Furthermore, these reductions were more pronounced in children with IKD and CALs. This pattern suggests that lower FA and VD3 levels may increase the risk of more severe coronary lesions in KD patients. Therefore, monitoring these biomarkers could provide valuable insights for early clinical diagnosis and intervention."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Vitamin B12 deficiency can manifest through various oral manifestations such as glossitis, glossodynia, recurrent ulcers, cheilitis, dysgeusia, lingual paresthesia, burning sensations, and pruritus. These oral signs can serve as early indicators of systemic conditions such pernicious anemia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 67 year old northern African female presented at the oral surgery service with complaints of a sore mouth and difficulty eating certain types of food. Her medical history revealed hypothyroidism and no history of gastrectomy. She was diagnosed with pernicious anemia in 2014 and is under hydroxocobalamin injection 5000μg/month since then. Dental history indicated extraction of all teeth, and in 2014, the patient was diagnosed with oral lichen planus. There were no contributory oral habits. Intraoral examination revealed a band like erythematous lesion on the palate with two superficial ulcerations, diagnosed as related to her pernicious anemia. The patient was prescribed a mouthwash containing sodium bicarbonate and corticosteroid to reduce inflammation and alleviate pain. A low level laser therapy was also considered to reduce the burning sensations. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Pernicious anemia (PA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the gradual atrophy of the gastric mucosa, predominantly affecting the body and fundus of the stomach, leading to vitamin B12 deficiency. Its insidious onset often masks its presence. Patients have no anemic symptoms. However, they can present with oral manifestations related to vitamin B12 deficiency. Those oral signs can precede hematological symptoms helping in early diagnosis of PA. CONCLUSION: Dentists and other oral health care providers must be aware of this condition and its oral manifestations. Investigating vitamin B12 levels should be considered in patients presenting with oral ulcers, oral erythema or burning sensations without an apparent origin."

This study aims to evaluate the effects of valproate and vitamin B12 on oxidative stress in an experimental epilepsy model induced by penicillin when administered alone or in combination. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 35 male Wistar rats were used in this study. The rats were divided into five groups, which were saline group, 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg Vit B12 groups and Sodium valproate group Sodium valproate + Vit B12 group. The epileptic activity was induced by 500 IU of penicillin injection. Sodium valproate and Vitamin B12 were administered 30 min after penicillin administration. Electrocorticogram recordings were taken for 2 hours post-treatment and serum parameters were assessed for oxidative stress markers using spectrophotometric method. RESULTS: There is statistically significant difference between the groups in total antioxidant status, total oxidant status, and oxidative stress index value (p=0.013; p˂0.001; p˂0.001, respectively). The valproate+vitamin B12 group showed elevated total thiol and native thiol levels, along with reduced disulphide levels, resulting in the lowest OSI value. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest the combined treatment effectively reduces oxidative stress. This study provides valuable insights into the antioxidant properties of valproate and vitamin B12, positioning them as potential agents for managing epilepsy. Understanding the efficacy and reliability of antioxidant strategies in epilepsy management could contribute significantly to advancements in epilepsy therapeutics."

This condition falls within the category of metabolic neuropathies. We documented a case involving bilateral nutritional optic neuropathy attributed to pancytopenia associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. A healthy 65-year-old Indian woman reported a bilateral, progressive, painless decline in vision over the past six months. She had a history of reduced oral intake for the preceding year and denied experiencing any gastrointestinal or constitutional symptoms. Bilateral visual acuity was 1/60. Examination revealed pale optic discs with attenuated vessels in both eyes and a cup-disc ratio of 0.3. The blood analysis showed low indices and a deficiency in serum vitamin B12. Despite undergoing treatment, her vision remained impaired due to the chronic nature of the condition. This case highlights the importance of identifying visual symptoms in an elderly woman experiencing malnutrition caused by inadequate dietary habits, which leads to bilateral nutritional optic neuropathy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The absorption of vitamin B12 is hindered in pernicious anemia (PA) owing to intrinsic factor deficiency. Traditionally, intramuscular vitamin B12 injections were the standard treatment, bypassing the impaired absorption. Although there is potential for oral vitamin B12 supplementation through passive enteral absorption, it is not commonly prescribed in PA owing to limited studies assessing its efficacy. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the efficacy of oral vitamin B12 supplementation in PA. METHODS: We enrolled participants diagnosed with incident vitamin B12 deficiency related to PA. The diagnosis of PA was based on the presence of classical immune gastritis and of anti-intrinsic factor and/or antiparietal cell antibodies. To evaluate the vitamin B12 status, we measured total plasma vitamin B12, plasma homocysteine, and plasma methylmalonic acid (pMMA) concentration and urinary methylmalonic acid-to-creatinine ratio. Participants were treated with oral cyanocobalamin at a dosage of 1000 μg/d throughout the study duration. Clinical and biological vitamin B12 deficiency related features were prospectively and systematically assessed over the 1-y study duration. RESULTS: We included 26 patients with vitamin B12 deficiency revealing PA. Following 1 mo of oral vitamin B12 supplementation, 88.5% of patients were no longer deficient in vitamin B12, with significant improvement of plasma vitamin B12 [407 (297-485) compared with 148 (116-213) pmol/L; P < 0.0001], plasma homocysteine [13.5 (10.9-29.8) compared with 18.6 (13.7-46.8) μmol/L; P < 0.0001], and pMMA [0.24 (0.16-0.38) compared with 0.56 (0.28-1.09) pmol/L; P < 0.0001] concentrations than those at baseline. The enhancement of these biological parameters persisted throughout the 12-month follow-up, with no patients showing vitamin B12 deficiency by the end of the follow-up period. The median time to reverse initial vitamin B12 deficiency abnormalities ranged from 1 mo for hemolysis to 4 mo for mucosal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Oral supplementation with 1000 μg/d of cyanocobalamin has been shown to improve vitamin B12 deficiency in PA.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inorganic arsenic is metabolized to monomethyl- (MMAs) and dimethyl- (DMAs) species via one-carbon metabolism (OCM); this facilitates urinary arsenic elimination. OCM is influenced by folate and vitamin B12 and previous randomized control trials (RCTs) showed that folic acid (FA) supplementation increases arsenic methylation in adults. This RCT investigated the effects of FA + B12 supplementation on arsenic methylation in children, a key developmental stage where OCM supports growth. METHODS: A total of 240 participants (8-11 years, 53 % female) drinking from wells with arsenic concentrations > 50 μg/L, were encouraged to switch to low arsenic wells and were randomized to receive 400 μg FA + 5 μg B12 or placebo daily for 12-weeks. Urine and blood samples were collected at baseline, week 1 (only urine) and week 12. Generalized estimated equation (GEE) models were used to assess treatment effects on arsenic species in blood and urine. RESULTS: At baseline, the mean ± SD total blood and urinary arsenic were 5.3 ± 2.9 μg/L and 91.2 ± 89.5 μg/L. Overall, total blood and urine arsenic decreased by 11.7% and 17.6%, respectively, at the end of follow up. Compared to placebo, the supplementation group experienced a significant increase in the concentration of blood DMAs by 14.0% (95% CI 5.0, 25.0) and blood secondary methylation index (DMAs/MMAs) by 0.19 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.35) at 12 weeks. Similarly, there was a 1.62% (95% CI: 0.43, 20.83) significantly higher urinary %DMAs and -1.10% (95% CI: -1.73, -0.48) significantly lower urinary %MMAs in the supplementatio group compared to the placebo group after 1 week. The direction of the changes in the urinary %iAs, %MMAs, and %DMAs at week 12 were consistent with those at week 1, though estimates were not significant. Treatment effects were stronger among participants with higher baseline blood arsenic concentrations. Results were consistent across males and females, and participants with higher and lower folate and B12 status at baseline. CONCLUSION: This RCT confirms that FA + B12 supplementation increases arsenic methylation in children as reflected by decreased MMAs and increased DMAs in blood and urine. Nutritional interventions may improve arsenic methylation and elimination in children, potentially reducing arsenic toxicity while also improving nutritional status.",

We searched PubMed and Embase until January 12, 2023. Only randomized control trials involving participants clearly diagnosed with AD and who received vitamin B12 and folic acid were enrolled. Five studies that met the criteria were selected for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Changes in cognitive function were measured based on either the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog). Changes in daily life function and the level of blood homocysteine were also investigated. After a 6-month treatment, administration of vitamin B12 and folic acid improved the MMSE scores more than placebo did (SMD = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.32, p = 0.04) but did not significantly affect ADAS-Cog scores (SMD = 0.06, 95% CI = -0.22 to 0.33, p = 0.68) or measures of daily life function. Blood homocysteine levels were significantly decreased after vitamin B12 and folic acid treatment. Participants with AD who received 6 months of vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation had better MMSE scores but had no difference in ADAS-Cog scores. Daily life function did not improve after treatment.",

The case we present here illustrates the unique characteristics of severe B12 deficiency, highlighting key differentiators from other conditions, including decreased reticulocyte counts and markedly elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels indicative of suppressed erythropoiesis. Advanced cobalamin deficiency affects all cell lines, leading to peripheral pancytopenia. Proposed mechanisms include fragile red blood cells prone to shearing, resulting in schistocyte formation, and hyperhomocysteinemia-induced oxidative stress exacerbating hemolysis. Prompt recognition and treatment with B12 replacement are critical, as illustrated by this case of hemolytic anemia and pancytopenia secondary to pernicious anemia, to prevent severe hematologic complications."
