      "abstract": "Psilocybin, a naturally occurring psychedelic compound, has garnered renewed scientific interest for its potential in treating psychiatric and neurological disorders. This review systematically examines the latest research on psilocybin's pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy, and safety profile. Emerging evidence supports its efficacy in conditions such as major depressive disorder (MDD), treatment-resistant depression (TRD), anxiety, alcohol use disorders (AUD), and cancer-related distress. Despite promising outcomes, significant barriers remain, including methodological constraints, regulatory hurdles, and limited population diversity in clinical trials. Advances in biosynthetic production and optimized psychotherapeutic integration are necessary to ensure scalability and accessibility. Future research should focus on long-term safety, dosing precision, and neurobiological mechanisms to refine its therapeutic applications. This review provides a critical foundation for advancing evidence-based clinical integration of psilocybin."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Liver inflammatory diseases are a major global health burden and are often exacerbated by inflammation driven by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) through toll-like receptor 4 signaling. This study evaluates the anti-inflammatory effects of psilocybin and eugenol in an LPS-induced liver inflammation model in C57BL/6J mice. Methods: Mice were treated with psilocybin (0.88 mg/kg) and/or eugenol (17.59 mg/kg) either before (pre-treatment) or after (post-treatment) LPS injection. Results: Psilocybin and eugenol, individually and in combination, significantly reduced the LPS-induced mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, with post-treatment administration exhibiting stronger effects than pre-treatment. Psilocybin alone displayed the most pronounced anti-inflammatory response, especially for IL-1β, IL-6, and MCP-1, while its combination with eugenol in 1:50 ratio demonstrated similar results, with strongly reduced COX-2 and TNF-α. Histological analysis revealed improved nuclear circularity and reduced inflammatory infiltration in the treatment groups. Eugenol alone showed potential adverse effects, including increased MCP-1 and GM-CSF, but this was mitigated by the co-administration of psilocybin. Conclusions: These findings highlight psilocybin and its combination with eugenol as promising therapies for hepatic inflammation, suggesting their application in treating acute and chronic liver diseases. Future research should explore their long-term effects, the mechanisms underlying their anti-inflammatory actions, and their therapeutic efficacy in humans."

      "abstract": "Psilocybin therapy (PT) is emerging as an effective intervention for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), offering comparable efficacy to conventional treatments like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Music, an emotionally evocative stimulus, provides a valuable tool to explore changes in hedonic and predictive processing mechanisms via expectancy violations, or 'surprises'. This study sought to compare behavioural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses to musical surprises in MDD patients treated with either PT or the SSRI, escitalopram. In this secondary analysis of a trial, 41 MDD patients (with usable fMRI data) were randomly assigned to either PT (n = 22) or escitalopram (n = 19) treatment groups. Participants listened to music during fMRI and tracked their emotional experience, both before and after a 6-week intervention. Surprise-related valence and arousal indices were calculated. Musical surprises were entered as regressors for whole-brain and region of interest fMRI analyses. PT caused a greater decrease in anhedonia scores compared with escitalopram. While escitalopram led to reductions in surprise-related affective responses, PT showed no significant change. Escitalopram was associated with increased activation in memory and emotional processing areas during musical surprises (versus control events) when compared with PT. Following PT, there was greater activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and sensory regions, and reduced activation in the angular gyrus. PT may allow for the subjective response to musical surprises to be maintained through a lasting reduction in the salience of prediction errors, or, alternatively, by increasing hedonic priors. Contrastingly, escitalopram may diminish hedonic priors, highlighting fundamental differences in treatment mechanisms."

PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library data up to July 2024 were analyzed. Two RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Changes in Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scores were assessed on day 1 and 2-week follow-up. The risk of bias was evaluated with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0.ResultsPsilocybin significantly reduced BDI scores at day 1 post-administration (MD = -2.26; P = 0.01), though effects were not sustained at 2 weeks. STAI state scores showed substantial reductions at both day 1 (MD = -11.52; P < 0.001) and 2 weeks (MD = -12.66; P < 0.001). STAI trait scores also improved on both day 1 and day 14. The highest psilocybin dose (0.3 mg/kg) was the most effective, with SUCRA values of 87.81% (BDI), 91.58% (STAI state), and 94.2% (STAI trait).ConclusionsFindings suggest psilocybin may rapidly reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms in cancer patients, but methodological limitations, including the small number of trials, necessitate cautious interpretation. Larger, high-quality RCTs are needed to verify its clinical potential."

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Psilocybin is a potentially paradigm-shifting depression intervention. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of psilocybin-for-depression randomized controlled trials (RCTs). OBJECTIVES: Systematically assess harm reporting, risk of bias, action mechanism specification, and incremental therapeutic effect sizes in the psilocybin-for-depression RCT literature. METHODS: Assessed databases included PsycINFO, CINAHL, Embase, Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus. Search terms \"Psilocybin\" or \"Psychedelic\" were paired with \"Depression\", and \"Randomized Controlled Trial\" or \"RCT\". RESULTS: We identified k = 9 RCTs (k = 10 subgroups) involving n = 602 participants (56% psilocybin). Five studies had low/very low harm quality reporting, opposed to two with high. Most studies demonstrated a high risk of bias. Therapeutic mechanisms of action (MoAs) were discussed in varying detail but rarely assessed in original publications. Psilocybin was moderately superior to controls at reducing depression (g = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.27, 0.98). Effects were heterogenous (τ = .47). Smaller studies evidenced stronger effects that favored psilocybin (Egger's b0 = 3.63, p = .014). Almost all studies documented financial conflicts of interests. CONCLUSION: Psilocybin demonstrates significant depression reduction relative to controls. However, researchers, clinicians, and stakeholders should consider several contextual factors. Effects were moderate and attenuated in larger and better-controlled studies. Harms reporting and risk of bias was high, though partly driven by unique challenges of psilocybin research. MoAs were variably specified but rarely assessed; suggesting it is unclear how depression is reduced. We advise researchers conduct RCTs with active control conditions, larger samples, and include MoA assessments. Independent RCTs from researchers without financial conflicts of interest are needed."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Psychological and existential distress is prevalent among patients with life-threatening cancer, significantly impacting their quality of life. Psilocybin-assisted therapy has shown promise in alleviating these symptoms. This systematic review aims to synthesize the evidence on the efficacy and safety of psilocybin in reducing cancer-related distress. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, APA PsycINFO, Cochrane database, Embase, and Scopus from inception to February 8, 2024, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), open-label trials, qualitative studies, and single case reports that evaluated psilocybin for cancer-related distress. Data were extracted on study characteristics, participant demographics, psilocybin and psychotherapy intervention, outcome measures, and results. Two authors independently screened, selected, and extracted data from the studies. Cochrane Risk of Bias for RCTs and Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies criteria were used to evaluate study quality. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024511692). RESULTS: Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising three RCTs, five open-label trials, five qualitative studies, and one single case report. Psilocybin therapy consistently showed significant reductions in depression, anxiety, and existential distress, with improvements sustained over several months. Adverse effects were generally mild and transient. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: This systematic review highlights the potential of psilocybin-assisted therapy as an effective treatment for reducing psychological and existential distress in cancer patients. Despite promising findings, further large-scale, well-designed RCTs are needed to confirm these results and address existing research gaps.",

      "abstract": "Psilocybin, the prodrug to the psychoactive compound in 'magic' mushrooms, is currently being studied in clinical trials as a treatment for severe mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety. Previous reports of psilocybin biosynthesis as reconstituted in E. coli reported maximum titers of 1.16 g/L, exclusively using genes from the most common recreationally used mushroom, Psilocybe cubensis. This study explores the effect of gene species variation on psilocybin and baeocystin production using various exogenous genes sourced from psilocybin-producing mushrooms Psilocybe cubensis, Psilocybe cyanescens, Panaeolus cyanescens, and Gymnopilus dilepis. The psiD and psiK genes sourced from P. cubensis demonstrated unequivocally superior performance, while psiM showed varied production levels of psilocybin and the pathway intermediate baeocystin with changes in gene source. Strains containing a psiM gene sourced from Psilocybe cyanescens demonstrated a higher degree of baeocystin selectivity as compared to other psiM genes, demonstrating a key difference between species. Most notably, the strain Gymdi30, containing psiM sourced from G. dilepis, achieved a psilocybin titer of 1.46 ± 0.13 g/L, the highest reported to date. Comparative proteomic analysis of Gymdi30 during periods of high and low productivity was also performed to investigate bottlenecks in cellular metabolism, which could be limiting strain performance. This work represents a significant improvement in psilocybin biosynthesis, a key step towards the development of a biosynthetic manufacturing route for psilocybin."

      "abstract": "Psilocybin, a naturally occurring psychedelic compound in magic mushrooms, shows promise as a novel intervention with a single administration inducing rapid and long-lasting antidepressant effects. However, there are limited studies on the optimal dosing required for the beneficial effects of psilocybin given its side effects. To address this gap, we investigated in Wistar rats whether a single psilocybin administration (0.1, 0.32, 1.0, and 3.2 mg/kg) had antidepressant-like effects in the forced swim test (FST), a pro-social effect in the social interaction test (SIT), and the ability to alter pleasure using the sucrose preference test (SPT). We also examined the dose-response relationships of psilocybin on the head-twitch response (HTR), locomotor activity, body temperature, and weight gain. Furthermore, we explored whether the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) paralleled the behavioral changes observed after psilocybin. In the FST, psilocybin induced dose-dependent inverted-U-shaped responses with only the intermediate dose of 0.32 mg/kg producing short and long-term antidepressant-like effects. A similar pattern was observed for the SIT, the SPT, and the HTR. In contrast, the high doses of psilocybin (1.0 and 3.2 mg/kg), while deprived of anti-depressant-like activity, significantly reduced body temperature, locomotor activity, and body weight gain. BDNF levels in the hippocampus and PFC increased dose-dependently after psilocybin, but linearly suggesting a dissociation between high BDNF levels and the observed antidepressant-like behaviors. Our results indicated that there is a narrow window for the therapeutic potential of psilocybin, with 0.32 mg/kg effectively producing antidepressant-like effects without the accompanying adverse effects observed only at higher doses.",

This systematic review assessed the safety and efficacy of psilocybin for SUDs through a systematic database search conducted via OVID on May 22, 2024, and summarized 26 ongoing clinical trials registered on clinicaltrials.gov. Among 16 published included studies, 7 (43.75 %) focused on Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), 5 (31.25 %) on Tobacco Use Disorder (TUD), and the remainder on Cocaine Use Disorder (CUD) (1, 6.25 %), Opioid Use Disorder (1, 6.25 %), Nicotine Use Disorder (1, 6.25 %), and multiple SUDs (1, 6.25 %). Study designs included open-label trials (5, 31.25 %), cross-sectional observational studies (6, 37.5 %), qualitative analyses (2, 12.5 %), one double-blind RCT (6.25 %), one pilot fMRI study (6.25 %), and one long-term follow-up (6.25 %). Psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy (PAP) was used in 10 studies (62.5 %), with doses ranging from microdosing to 20-40 mg/70 kg. PAP was associated with significant reductions in alcohol consumption, smoking cessation, and related psychological improvements. AUD studies reported fewer heavy drinking days, increased abstinence rates, and neuroimaging data indicating normalization of brain activity. TUD studies demonstrated high smoking abstinence rates, with mystical experiences predicting long-term outcomes. Findings for other SUDs were mixed, though psilocybin showed potential in reducing opioid dependence and nicotine use. Preliminary evidence supports psilocybin's efficacy and safety for AUD and TUD, particularly with psychotherapy, but larger clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings."

This study aimed to examine the alignment of clinical trial protocols for psilocybin in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and treatment-resistant depression (TRD) with established regulatory requirements.A cross-sectional investigation was conducted on ClinicalTrials.gov using the keywords: \"Psilocybin\" and \"Psilocin\" to identify interventional studies with posted trial protocols. Only protocols for MDD and TRD were included. Data extraction focused on key regulatory aspects, including safety, functional unblinding, expectancy bias, and the distribution of investigational medical products.Eleven psilocybin trial protocols were identified, with four meeting the inclusion criteria. The most commonly studied psilocybin dose was 25 mg. Two trials were double-blind. Although the analyzed protocols superficially adhered to regulatory requirements, there were gaps in addressing potential drug interactions, the acute and chronic concurrent use of antidepressants, and prohibited medications. Certain aspects, such as functional unblinding or expectancy bias, did not share all pathways. Risk mitigation strategies were primarily based on external criteria. Patients with bipolar spectrum disorders or schizoaffective disorders were excluded.This study underscores the importance of conducting clinical trials on psychedelics in strict adherence to regulatory standards. Future research should focus on improving regulatory compliance and exploring the efficacy of psychedelics in broader patient populations."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Prolonged grief disorder (PGD) represents a substantial public health issue, especially in oncology settings where it affects up to 30% of bereaved carers. Current best-practice treatments are lengthy, and up to 50% of participants have persistent PGD. Building on encouraging recent research with psychedelic-assisted therapies, the Psilocybin-Assisted suppoRtive psychoTherapy IN the treatment of prolonged Grief (PARTING) trial is the first study to consider psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy as a potential treatment for prolonged grief. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PARTING is an open-label pilot trial of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for approximately 15 people with cancer-related PGD. It aims to investigate feasibility, safety, acceptability, participant experience and participant-reported therapeutic effects. Over a 5-week intervention period, participants will undergo three preparation sessions before receiving a psychoactive (25 mg) dose of psilocybin alongside non-directive supportive guidance, followed by four integration sessions. All sessions will be delivered by a psychologist and either a nurse or Indigenous Therapist. An artificial intelligence-assisted tool will be used to create an artwork of participants' psychedelic experience.Outcomes will be investigated over a 12-month follow-up period. Feasibility will be assessed through recruitment/retention rates and completion of follow-up assessments. Safety will be evaluated via adverse events over 12 months and the comparison of physiological measures (vital signs, biochemistry, haematology, ECG) recorded during screening and 1 day after the psilocybin dose. Qualitative thematic analysis of semistructured interviews with participants and trial therapists will assess acceptability and the therapeutic potential of the treatment. Diagnostic clinical interviews for PGD and quantitative participant-reported measures of therapeutic effects are also being collected. Participant-reported measures include grief severity, depression, anxiety, grief avoidance, psychological flexibility, connectedness, and quality of life. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval has been obtained from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute Human Research Ethics Committee (P3801). Dissemination of results will occur via conference presentations, peer-reviewed publications and media.

      "abstract": "Mood dysfunction is highly prevalent in Parkinson's disease (PD), a main predictor of functional decline, and difficult to treat-novel interventions are critically needed. Psilocybin shows early promise for treating depression and anxiety, but its potential in PD is unknown, as safety concerns have excluded people with neurodegenerative disease from previous trials. In this open-label pilot (NCT04932434), we examined the feasibility of psilocybin therapy among people with mild to moderate stage PD plus depression and/or anxiety. 12 participants (mean age 63.2 ± 8.2 years, 5 women) received psilocybin (one 10 mg followed by one 25 mg dose) with psychotherapy. There were no serious adverse events, no medical interventions required to manage effects of psilocybin, and no exacerbation of psychosis. Ten participants experienced treatment-emergent adverse events; the most frequent were anxiety, nausea, and increased blood pressure. We observed no worsening of PD symptomology measured by the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). On the contrary, non-motor (MDS-UPDRS Part I: -13.8 ± 1.3, p < 0.001, Hedges' g = 3.0) and motor symptoms (Part II: -7.5 ± 0.9, p < 0.001, g = 1.2; Part III: -4.6 ± 1.3, p = 0.001; g = 0.3) as well as performance in select cognitive domains (Paired Associates Learning [-0.44 ± 0.14, p = .003, g = 0.4], Spatial Working Memory [-0.52 ± 0.17, p = 0.003, g = 0.7], and Probabilistic Reversal Learning [2.9 ± 0.9, p = 0.003, g = 1.3]) improved post-treatment, and improvements were sustained until the final safety assessment one month following drug exposure. Baseline Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) scores were 21.0 ± 8.7 and 17.0 ± 3.7, respectively. Both improved to a clinically meaningful degree post-treatment; these improvements persisted to the final assessment three months following drug exposure (MADRS: -9.3 ± 2.7, p = .001, g = 1.0; HAM-A: -3.8 ± 1.7; p = 0.031, g = 0.7). This study provides the first data on psilocybin's effects in any neurodegenerative disease. Results suggest that psilocybin therapy in PD warrants further investigation."

Currently, synthetic material is used to meet the demand for legitimate pharmaceutical purposes. Here, we report an in vitro approach to biocatalytically produce psilocybin on a solid-phase matrix charged with five covalently bound biosynthetic enzymes. These enzymes include three Psilocybe enzymes: IasA*, an engineered l-tryptophan decarboxylase/aromatic aldehyde synthase, the 4-hydroxytryptamine kinase PsiK and the norbaeocystin methyltransferase PsiM, along with Escherichia coli nucleosidase MtnN and adenine deaminase Ade. In a proof-of-principle experiment, this enzyme-charged resin allowed for quantitative turnover of 4-hydroxy-l-tryptophan into psilocybin. This facile process i) represents a sustainable approach with reusable enzymes, ii) circumvents the drawbacks of in vivo processes while harnessing the selectivity of enzymatic catalysis and iii) helps access an urgently needed drug candidate."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Although long known for their psychoactive effects, psychedelic drugs have only recently been investigated for medicinal use. Psilocybin has attracted the greatest interest with studies suggesting that it may be a useful agent in psychiatry and in palliative care. AREAS COVERED: Clinical trials that included psilocybin were searched in PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov, demonstrating that adult psychiatry and palliative care are the medical fields that show the greatest interest in psilocybin treatment. EXPERT OPINION: Psilocybin is a powerful drug that needs to be used with caution but may benefit some patients, including when other options have failed. It is best evidenced in treatment resistant depression and in palliative care, where patients are usually treated in specialist care centers. It has a novel mechanism of action, targeting the 5HT2A receptor, and can show rapid onset of action. There are many questions regarding its use that remain to be clarified, including its efficacy for other indications and its role as adjunctive treatment in psychotherapy. The psychoactive, or psychedelic effects are well documented, but their clinical importance is disputed."

      "abstract": "Psilocybin, a tryptamine-derived alkaloid, has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the U.S. FDA for treatment-resistant depression, underscoring its clinical importance. Therefore, sustainable and economic production is urgently needed. Manufacturing of psilocybin in Escherichia coli has drawn great attention. However, due to the low expression and activity of the eukaryotic cytochrome P450 enzyme PsiH in the psilocybin biosynthetic pathway, de novo synthesis of psilocybin in prokaryotic cells has been hampered. To overcome this dilemma, we herein demonstrated de novo synthesis of psilocybin in E. coli by constructing PsiH variants with N-terminal domain modifications and expressing the entire biosynthetic pathway at a concordantly low temperature. Improving the supply of precursor and engineering the P450 electron transfer chain resulted in a 33-fold increase in the titre of norbaeocystin (105.3 mg/L), a key intermediate of psilocybin biosynthesis, and a 17-fold increase in the titre of psilocybin (14 mg/L). Further enhancement of psilocybin production was achieved by converting norbaeocystin to psilocybin by overexpressing an extra copy of the methyltransferase gene psiM. Finally, 79.4 mg/L of psilocybin was produced by optimising flask fermentation conditions, a 100-fold improvement over the starting strain. Our work demonstrates the successful fungal P450 engineering to improve the catalytic activity in E. coli and will advance the sustainable production of the important antidepressant psilocybin in prokaryotic microbial cells.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Fibromyalgia (FM) is the prototypical nociplastic pain condition, characterized by widespread pain and issues with cognition, mood, and sleep. Currently, there are limited treatment options available that effectively treat FM symptoms. Psilocybin-assisted therapy (PAT) is an emerging combined drug-therapy intervention, but no studies to-date have investigated PAT for FM. METHODS: Here, we report findings from an open-label, pilot clinical trial of PAT for FM (N = 5). In conjunction with psychotherapy (two preparatory, four integration sessions), participants received two doses of oral psilocybin (15 mg and 25 mg) delivered two weeks apart. RESULTS: Regarding safety (primary outcome), there were transient elevations of blood pressure or heart rate during dosing which normalized by the end of treatment, with no serious adverse events. Four of five participants reported transient headaches following dosing. Compared to baseline, participants reported clinically meaningful improvements in the following secondary outcomes one month following their second psilocybin dose (reported as Cohen's d): pain severity [d = -2.1, 95% CI(-3.7 to -0.49)], pain interference [d = -1.8, 95% CI (-3.27 to -0.24)], and sleep disturbance [d = -2.5, 95% CI (-4.21 to -0.75)]. Using the Patient Global Impression of Change, one participant reported their symptoms \"very much improved,\" two reported \"much improved,\" and two reported \"minimally improved.\" We stopped recruitment early because of concerns about generalizability and changes in FDA guidance for psychedelic clinical trials that occurred data collection. DISCUSSION: This small open-label trial preliminarily supports that PAT is well-tolerated by people with FM, establishing a basis for larger randomized controlled trials.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: SAPAP3-knockout (SAPAP3-KO) mice develop excessive self-grooming behavior at 4-6 months of age, serving as a model for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Given that anxiety often precedes OCD diagnosis in humans, this study investigated whether juvenile SAPAP3-KO mice exhibit anxiety-like behaviors before developing the self-grooming phenotype, and whether such behaviors respond to psilocybin treatment. The study also examined four key neuroplasticity-related synaptic proteins-GAP43, PSD95, synaptophysin, and SV2A - as SAPAP3 is a postsynaptic scaffold protein that interacts with PSD95 and may affect synaptic function. METHODS: Two studies were conducted using male and female juvenile (10-13 weeks) SAPAP3-KO mice. Study 1 compared behavioral phenotypes between homozygous (HOM), heterozygous (HET), and wild-type (WT) mice. Study 2 evaluated a different sample of HOM and WT mice and assessed the effect of psilocybin (4.4 mg/kg) on identified behavioral differences. Both studies included comprehensive behavioral testing focused on anxiety-like behavior, social interaction, and cognitive function. Additionally, levels of four synaptic proteins were measured by western blots in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and striatum of juvenile and adult SAPAP3-KO mice. RESULTS: In both studies, juvenile HOM SAPAP3-KO mice showed significant anxiety-like behaviors compared to WT mice, spending less time in open field center, and elevated plus maze open arms. They also buried fewer marbles and found fewer buried Oreos than WT mice. Psilocybin treatment did not improve these behavioral manifestations. Analysis of synaptic proteins revealed significant increases in GAP43, synaptophysin, and SV2A across multiple brain regions in adult male HOM mice and of SV2A in the frontal cortex of HOM females compared to WT, but not in juvenile mice of either sex. CONCLUSIONS: Juvenile SAPAP3-KO mice exhibit anxiety-like behaviors before developing the characteristic excessive self-grooming phenotype, paralleling the prodromal anxiety often seen in human OCD. Unlike in adult SAPAP3-KO mice, these manifestations were not responsive to psilocybin treatment. The age-dependent increases in synaptic proteins observed in adult (but not juvenile) male SAPAP3-KO mice homozygous for the deletion and to a lesser extent in female homozygotes, may represent compensatory plasticity changes in response to the phenotype. These results provide insights into the developmental trajectory of OCD-like behaviors and associated neuroplastic adaptations."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: With very few treatments available, post-comatose disorders of consciousness (DoC) pose one of the hardest challenges in modern neurology. Following promising clinical trial results in psychiatry, and a deepening understanding of their brain mechanisms, psychedelics have been suggested as a novel therapeutic drug for DoC patients, given that they increase the entropy or complexity of spontaneous activity in healthy participants. However, no attempts have been so far performed in patients with DoC. METHODS: In this case report, we describe the first-ever administration of psilocybin, a classic psychedelic (i.e., agonist at the 5-HT2A receptor), to a patient in a minimally conscious state plus. We report the behavioural effects and changes in neurophysiology measured with EEG. RESULTS: We report no increase in overt behavioural repertoire with validated scales, yet new spontaneous behaviour not previously seen, and increased brain complexity, as measured by the Lempel-Ziv complexity index, with changes in the underlying periodic rhythms. CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to future investigations exploring the use of psychedelics in DoC, enriching the discussion surrounding the role of psychedelics in medicine, and the link between brain complexity and consciousness. SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first-ever report of a classic psychedelic used as a treatment for post-comatose DoC."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite the promising therapeutic effects of psilocybin, its efficacy in preventing relapse after withdrawal treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD) remains unknown. This study aims to assess whether a single dose of psilocybin combined with brief psychotherapy could reduce relapse rates and alcohol use in AUD patients. METHODS: This single-center, double-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted in Switzerland. We recruited participants with AUD between June 8, 2020, and August 16, 2023 who completed withdrawal treatment within six weeks prior to enrollment. Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive either a single oral dose of psilocybin (25 mg) or placebo (mannitol), combined with brief psychotherapy. The primary outcomes were abstinence and mean alcohol use at 4-week follow-up. Participants completed the timeline followback to assess daily alcohol use. The trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04141501). FINDINGS: We included 37 participants who completed the 4-week follow-up (female:male = 14:23; psilocybin = 18, placebo = 19) in the analysis. There were no significant differences between groups in abstinence duration (p = 0.55, psilocybin mean = 16.80 days, 95% CI: 14.31-19.29; placebo mean = 13.80 days, 95% CI: 10.97-16.63; Cohen's d = 0.151) or mean alcohol use per day (p = 0.51, psilocybin: median = 0.48 standard alcohol units, range: 0-3.99, placebo: median = 0.54 standard alcohol units, range: 0-5.96; Cohen's d = 0.11) at 4-week or 6-month follow-up (abstinence: Cohen's d = 0.10, alcohol use: Cohen's d = 0.075). Participants in both groups reported reduced craving and temptation to drink alcohol after the dosing visit, with an additional reduction observed in the psilocybin group. Thirteen adverse events occurred in the psilocybin and seven in the placebo group. One serious adverse event occurred in the psilocybin and four in the placebo group, all related to inpatient withdrawal treatments. INTERPRETATION: A single dose of psilocybin combined with five psychotherapy sessions may not be sufficient to reduce relapse rates and alcohol use in severely affected AUD patients following withdrawal treatment. However, given the limited sample size of our study, larger trials are needed in the future to confirm these findings.

The primary outcome of changes in depression symptoms was measured by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Secondary outcomes included changes in anxiety symptom severity (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item [GAD-7]), suicidal ideation (MADRS Item-10), self-reported depression symptoms (Quick Inventory for Depression Symptomology [QIDS-SR]), and intensity of psychedelic experience (Mystical Experience Questionnaire 30-item [MEQ30]). Patients were separated into two groups for analysis; those who were unmedicated at initial screening versus participants that had to taper off antidepressant medications to be eligible for the trial. A mixed analysis of variance was used to evaluate clinical outcomes over time from baseline to 2 months post-dose.ResultsNo significant differences were found between medication discontinued (n = 18) and unmedicated at screening (UAS) (n = 9) groups in clinician rated depression (p = 0.759), self-reported depression (p = 0.215), anxiety (p = 0.178), and suicidality (p = 0.882) symptoms over time, with both groups having clinically significant benefits on all outcomes assessed. Both groups also had a similar intensity of psychedelic experience (p = 0.191).ConclusionComparable improvements were observed in depression and anxiety and symptoms between antidepressant discontinued and UAS patients. These findings contrast with and contribute to the growing literature on the effects of medication tapering leading up to PAP. Further clinical research is needed to directly compare efficacy across medication statuses, in addition to evaluating psychedelic effects in individuals continuing antidepressants during PAP."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As the field of psychedelic therapy grows, it is vital to consider who can safely engage with psilocybin therapy. In most modern clinical trials of psilocybin therapy, individuals with a family history of bipolar disorder (BD) have been excluded from participation because of their genetic predisposition for developing BD. REVIEW: Case studies and survey data shed light on the risks of psilocybin therapy among those with a family history of BD in the absence of data from modern clinical trials. We review existing evidence that could inform risk stratification for these individuals, including genetic proximity to the affected relative, BD type, age at onset in the relative, and participant age. Hypothesizing that the risk of developing BD may predict the risk of developing serious adverse events when engaging with psilocybin therapy, we propose a risk stratification tool to be utilized when determining the relative risks of psilocybin therapy to those with a family history of BD in the context of clinical trials. CONCLUSION: Balancing the need for effective treatments against the potential for serious adverse events in those undergoing psilocybin therapy with a family history of BD, we argue for caution in psychedelic clinical trials but not outright exclusion of these individuals. Our risk stratification tool allows for more nuanced inclusion and exclusion criteria."

In our first three retreats, however, we had two unexpected experiences with touch that led us to iterate our initial guidelines into a new version of guidelines. In this Technical Report, we describe our evolving guidelines specifying acceptable practices for facilitator use of touch to ensure a safe, supportive, and therapeutic participant experience. Our primary goal with these guidelines is to create a haptic experience during the psilocybin session that reinforces the participants' sense of safety and supports their own experience during the psilocybin session. Our secondary goal is to allow the facilitator team to notice and maintain therapeutic boundaries and to respond to participant experiences with empathy and openness in the context of those boundaries (Clinical Trials No: NCT05847686)."

      "abstract": "Background: The largest randomized study of psilocybin to date demonstrated the efficacy of COMP360 25 mg (Compass Pathways' investigational proprietary pharmaceutical-grade synthesized psilocybin formulation) in participants with treatment-resistant depression (COMP 001), compared with 10 mg and 1 mg doses. Here, we report findings from COMP 004, a 52-week observational follow-up of patients from COMP 001 and COMP 003, a small open-label study of the coadministration of 25 mg COMP360 with continuing antidepressant treatment. Methods: Adverse events (AEs) were collected over the full 52-week period. The primary efficacy endpoint was time to a prespecified depressive event over the 52 weeks following COMP360 administration in COMP 001 participants, presented as Kaplan-Meier estimates. A post hoc analysis included only participants that entered COMP 004. Data were collected from July 2020 to July 2022. Results: Sixty-six participants entered COMP 004 (COMP 001, n = 58 [25 mg group n = 22, 10 mg group n = 19, 1 mg group n = 17]; COMP 003, n = 8). Few AEs were reported post-entry into COMP 004, with 1 AE of mild suicidal ideation in the 1 mg group deemed possibly related to study drug. For all COMP 001 patients (n = 233), median time to depressive event was greater for the 25 mg group (92 days) compared to the 10 mg (83 days) and 1 mg (62 days) groups, with the majority of participants having had a depressive event by Week 12 (25 mg n = 37/75, 10 mg n = 38/79, 1 mg n = 44/75). The post hoc supplementary analysis of those who enrolled in COMP 004 from COMP 001 exhibited the difference between groups more strikingly (25 mg, 189 days; 10 mg, 43 days; 1 mg, 21 days); however, only 10 participants experienced a depressive event post-COMP 004 enrollment (25 mg n = 6, 10 mg n = 3, 1 mg n = 1) from COMP 001 and none from COMP 003. At COMP 004 entry, the 1 mg group had the highest number of participants on antidepressant medication (n = 10; 10 mg, n = 9; 25 mg, n = 6) and generally initiated treatment earlier. Conclusion: Over 52 weeks, a single administration of 25 mg psilocybin suggested longer maintenance of antidepressant effect than both 1 mg and 10 mg. Larger long-term studies are required to confirm these findings and provide clarity on the longer-term effects of psilocybin. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04519957.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Psychedelic-assisted therapy has gained growing interest to improve a range of mental health outcomes. In response, numerous training programs have formed to train the necessary workforce to deliver psychedelic therapy. These include both legal and 'underground' (i.e., unregulated) programs that use psychedelics as part of their training. Prolonged adverse experiences (PAEs) may arise from psychedelic use, though they are poorly characterized in the clinical literature. Thus, understanding the potential harms related to psychedelic use is critical as psychedelic therapy training programs consider strategies to potentially integrate psychedelic use into therapy training. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a psychologist who underwent psychedelic therapy training that involved repeated high doses of psilocybin-containing mushrooms and subsequently developed prolonged adverse effects including severe sleep impairment, anhedonia, and suicidal ideation requiring hospitalization. Despite worsening symptoms, her psychedelic therapy trainers advised her against seeking psychiatric support, delaying treatment. Ultimately, the patient's symptoms resolved after a course of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the tensions between legal and underground psychedelic use within psychedelic therapy training programs, psychiatry and neo-shamanism, and the use of psychiatric interventions (i.e., ECT) and energy medicine to address prolonged adverse effects from psychedelics. Clinicians should be aware of these potential conflicts between psychiatric conceptualizations of PAEs and frameworks maintained in psychedelic community practices and their impacts on patients' presenting symptoms, decision making, and emotional challenges.",

While current studies involve two dosing sessions, the effects of a single dose have not been investigated. AIMS: To investigate the pharmacokinetics, feasibility, safety and efficacy of single-dose psilocybin therapy in AUD. METHODS: This open-label, single-group study investigated single-dose psilocybin therapy in 10 treatment-seeking adults (8 men and 2 women; median age 44 years) with severe AUD. The treatment involved two preparation sessions, a high-dose psilocybin session (25 mg) and two integration sessions. Pharmacokinetics were determined by noncompartmental analysis, and changes in alcohol consumption, craving and self-efficacy, were assessed using a linear mixed model. RESULTS: Notable between-participant pharmacokinetic variations were observed, with peak plasma psilocin concentrations ranging from 14 to 59 µg/L. Alcohol consumption significantly decreased over the 12 weeks following psilocybin administration. Heavy drinking days were reduced by 37.5 percentage points (95% CI: -61.1 to -13.9, p = 0.005), and drinks per day decreased by 3.4 drinks (95% CI: -6.5 to -0.3, p = 0.03). This was corroborated by reports of rapid and sustained reductions in craving and increases in self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Despite pharmacokinetic variations, a single 25 mg psilocybin dose was safe and effective in reducing alcohol consumption in AUD patients. Larger randomised, placebo-controlled, single-dose AUD trials are warranted. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04718792."

These head injuries induce cognitive, motor, and behavioral deficits that can last for months and even years with an increased risk of dementia, Parkinson's disease, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. There is no approved medical treatment for these types of head injuries. To this end, we tested the healing effects of the psychedelic psilocybin, as it is known to reduce neuroinflammation and enhance neuroplasticity. Using a model of mild repetitive head injury in adult female rats, we provide unprecedented data that psilocybin can reduce vasogenic edema, restore normal vascular reactivity and functional connectivity, reduce phosphorylated tau buildup, enhance levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and its receptor TrkB, and modulate lipid signaling molecules."

PD patients may have problems adjusting to their chronic progressive neurological disease. A change from emotional avoidance to acceptance has been reported following psilocybin administration in patients with treatment-resistant depression.ObjectiveTo report for the first time the effect of psilocybin in a PD patient.MethodsA non-depressed 43-year-old female with a 2-year history of PD presented with difficulty adjusting to PD, anxious ruminations and pessimism. The patient declined an increase in dopaminergic medication or the introduction of an anxiolytic. Therapeutic patient education was not beneficial. The patient received four sessions of high-dose PAP within one year. Neurological and psychiatric assessments were performed before and at one year follow-up using qualitative interviews and quantitative assessment of motor status, dispositional optimism, depression, anxiety, apathy, and well-being.ResultsPAP was well tolerated. It significantly improved the patient's overall pessimistic outlook on her future and decreased her anxious ruminations and worries about potential handicap due to PD. Her general well-being improved, as well as all psychometric scores except for the apathy scale. Motor status remained unchanged. Better acceptance of PD allowed her to accept pharmacological treatment adjustment.ConclusionsPAP could be a safe and useful treatment for PD patients with dispositional pessimism and difficulties accepting their disease by promoting profound decentration from habitual thoughts and emotions, improving mood and PD acceptance.

      "abstract": "Psychedelic drugs, known for their perception-altering properties, are gaining popularity in the treatment of mental health and pain disorders. As exploratory studies demonstrate clinical efficacy with few adverse events, it is expected that more patients will ingest psychedelic drugs. For therapeutic reasons, as with any drug, anaesthesiologists must be aware of its physiological effects and contraindications to ensure the safe provision of anaesthesia. Psilocybin is a 5HT 1A and 5HT 2A serotonin receptor agonist thought to act on excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the brain. Acute ingestion causes sympathetic nervous system activation, which can precipitate haemodynamic instability. Activation of the 5HT serotonin receptors can also place the patient at risk of serotonin syndrome. Chronic use increases plasma concentrations of cortisol, which has implications on prophylactic stress-dosing of glucocorticoids preoperatively. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), a synthetic psychoactive substance, is also a 5HT2 A agonist. LSD has been shown to potentiate opioid analgesics, and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibition. Historical reports suggest that LSD has anticholinesterase activity and can prolong neuromuscular block with depolarising muscle relaxants. Mescaline is a poorly understood psychedelic with similar autonomic effects. Historical studies have shown decreased neuromuscular transmission and an association with malignant hyperthermia. When managing patients who have consumed psychedelics drugs, it is important to consider delaying surgery whenever possible, to allow acute intoxication to wane. A high degree of suspicion and an understanding of management principles is vital to the safe conduct of anaesthesia. Future research should explore therapeutic doses of psychedelic drugs to understand physiologic effects at various concentrations.",

The aim of this study was to gain a representative impression, as far as possible, of the level of information and attitudes towards the implementation of psilocybin-assisted therapy (PAT) among mental health experts, patients and the general population. METHODS: An online survey was used to collect information on the attitudes and knowledge of 1456 participants and to test the effect of a brief intervention. Results were determined using analyses of variance and regression models. RESULTS: Regression analyses showed that a higher knowledge score and self-assessed level of knowledge, own treatment experience and also own experience with psychedelics predicted more positive attitudes towards the introduction of PAT, F(8, 1447) = 154.646, p < 0.001, R2 = 0.39. Providing information about the potential of PAT only led to higher acceptance when combined with information about its risks. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that participants are optimistic about the implementation of PAT. The relationship between knowledge and acceptance was confirmed. The fact that receiving balanced information leads to higher acceptance should be taken into account when educating and reporting on PAT."

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric condition that develops following exposure to a traumatic event. Individuals with this condition experience numerous physiological and behavioral alterations, including intrusive memories, avoidance of trauma-related stimuli, heightened anxiety, hypervigilance, impaired cognition, elevated resting heart rate and blood pressure, and altered neuroendocrine function, to name a few. In most patients, currently available pharmacological and psychological treatments are insufficient to alleviate the array of symptoms associated with the disorder. Thus, novel treatment options that can more effectively target the core etiology of PTSD are desperately needed. Recent work demonstrating the psychoplastogenic effects of psychedelics has reinvigorated research to examine their therapeutic potential in psychiatric conditions. Psilocybin, a psychedelic found in the Psilocybe genus of mushrooms, has exhibited promising antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in preclinical and clinical studies. The purpose of this review is to summarize the existing research that has examined the behavioral effects of psilocybin and link it to potential efficacy in treating PTSD-related symptoms. The proposed mechanisms for psilocybin's effects are then explored, as are the benefits and drawbacks for the agent's therapeutic use. Finally, the challenges faced by investigators aiming to study psilocybin as a therapeutic aid in future studies are discussed in order to shed light on this budding area of research. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Current pharmacotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder is insufficient. Traditional antidepressants and anxiolytics help reduce symptom severity, but nonresponse rates often reach levels greater than 50%, emphasizing the need for more effective treatment options. The goal of this review is to summarize the existing evidence for and the potential mechanisms of the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of psilocybin, a psychedelic compound found in the Psilocybe genus of mushrooms. The observed effects are then related to psilocybin's potential use as a treatment for PTSD.",

Despite its prevalence, the mechanisms behind OCD remain elusive, and current treatments are limited. This protocol outlines an investigative study for individuals with OCD, exploring the potential of psilocybin to improve key components of cognition implicated in the disorder. The PsilOCD study strives to assess the effects of low-moderate psilocybin treatment (10 mg) alongside non-interventional therapy on several facets of OCD. The main focus points of PsilOCD are cognitive flexibility, measured with cognitive tests, and neuroplasticity, assessed through electroencephalography (EEG). METHODS: 20 blinded participants with OCD will complete two dosing sessions, separated by four weeks, where they will receive 1 mg of psilocybin on the first and 10 mg on the second. The first dose serves as an active placebo, and the latter is a low-moderate dose that induces relatively mild-moderate emotional and perceptual effects. Participants will be supported by trained psychedelic therapists, who will sit with them during each dosing session and provide virtual preparation and integration sessions over the 12-week study period. Therapeutic support will be the same for both the 1 mg and 10 mg sessions. PsilOCD's primary outcomes include scores in the intradimensional-extradimensional (ID-ED) shift task, which is an established measure of cognitive flexibility, and neuroplasticity as quantified by a visual long-term potentiation (vLTP) task. This task is delivered as part of an EEG paradigm and measures acute quantified changes in neuroplasticity in the brain's visual system. The ID-ED task will be conducted twice, two days after each dosing session, and the EEG recordings will also be taken twice, immediately after each session. Secondary outcome assessments will include OCD and affective symptom severity, as well as an array of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), in the form of questionnaires designed to assess well-being, dissociable and well-established mood-related (affective) measures, and participants' subjective experience of the psilocybin experience. DISCUSSION: This study's results are expected to offer critical insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of psilocybin-assisted therapy in treating OCD, and whether these correlate with changes in the cognitive features of the condition. As a secondary aim, it will ascertain whether a low, tolerable dose is a feasible and efficacious clinical treatment, and will provide crucial data to guide the design of a potential follow-up randomised control trial (RCT)."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is surging interest in the therapeutic potential of psychedelic compounds like psilocybin in the treatment of psychiatric illnesses like major depressive disorder (MDD). Recent studies point to the rapid antidepressant effect of psilocybin; however, the biological mechanisms underlying these differences remain unknown. This study determines the feasibility of using diffusion MRI to characterize and define the potential spatiotemporal microstructural differences in the brain following psilocybin treatment in C57BL/6J male mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 11-15 week-old C57BL/6J male mice were randomized to receive psilocybin, 6F-DET (6-fluoro-N,Ndiethyltryptamine), or saline and ex vivo imaged 24h (n=18) and 72h (n=18) post treatment. A one-way ANOVA with multiple comparison testing (Bonferroni correction) assessed diffusion metric differences (tractography, DTI, NODDI) between the three groups and was performed in the following regions of interest: amygdala, striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, primary visual cortex area, frontal association cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex at 24h and 72h post drug administration. RESULTS: Psilocybin treated mice demonstrated structural connectivity differences at 72h in the frontal association cortex (compared to saline, mean tract length increases, p=0.03). Psilocybin also induced microstructural differences at 24h post-injection in the primary visual cortex (compared to saline, MD increases, p=0.02) and 72h post-injection in the striatum (compared to saline; MD increases, p= 0.02, NDI decreases, p=0.02) and hippocampus (compared to saline; MD increases, p=0.04, NDI decreases, p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion microstructure imaging and white matter tractography are sensitive methods to detect and characterize the neural substrates and microstructural differences accompanying psilocybin treatment. These findings suggest the potential role for diffusion microstructure imaging to quantify the bioeffects of psychedelics like psilocybin on the brain, monitor treatment response, and identify salient clinical endpoints in an emerging therapeutic option for patients with MDD.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Psilocybin is a serotonergic psychedelic with therapeutic potential for several neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety disorders. Serotonin transporter (5-HTT) knockout mice (KO) are a well-validated mouse model of anxiety/depression and are relevant to both chronic treatment with serotonin transporter reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) associated with depression/anxiety and resistance to classic antidepressant treatments. However, there is yet to be a study assessing the effect of psilocybin in 5-HTT KO mice. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We investigated the effects of a single dose of psilocybin (1 mg/kg) on locomotor activity and the head-twitch response as well as anxiety- and depressive-like behaviour in KO versus wild-type (WT) mice using the light-dark box and Porsolt swim test respectively. KEY RESULTS: We found that both the psilocybin-induced head-twitch and hyperlocomotor responses observed in WT mice were completely absent in KO animals. In female WT mice only, psilocybin was also able to block the weight loss observed one day after intraperitoneal injection. While psilocybin did not alter anxiety- and depression-like behaviours for both genotypes, we revealed a genotype-specific trend for a main effect of treatment for WT females (p = 0.054) in the Porsolt swim test. Finally, we found that only female KO mice exhibit anhedonia-like behaviour in the saccharin-preference test. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings highlight the complexity of psilocybin's effects and suggest that functional integrity of 5-HTT is essential for psilocybin's acute behavioural effects. This could also have implications for pharmacogenetics, including individuals with polymorphisms or mutations in 5-HTT.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Psilocybin shows promise for treating neuropsychiatric disorders. However, insight into its acute effects on cognition is lacking. Given the significant role of executive functions in daily life and treatment efficacy, it is crucial to evaluate how psilocybin influences these cognitive domains. OBJECTIVES: This meta-analysis aims to quantify the acute effects of psilocybin on executive functions and attention, while examining how dosage, timing of administration, cognitive domain, and task characteristics moderate these effects. METHODS: A systematic review and multilevel meta-analysis were conducted on empirical studies assessing psilocybin's acute effects on working memory, conflict monitoring, response inhibition, cognitive flexibility, and attention. Effect sizes for reaction time (RT) and accuracy (ACC) were calculated, exploring the effects of timing (on-peak defined as 90-180 min post-administration), dosage, cognitive function categories, and task sensitivity to executive functions as potential moderators. RESULTS: Thirteen studies (42 effect sizes) were included. In the acute phase, psilocybin increased RTs (Hedges' g = 1.13, 95% CI [0.57, 1.7]) and did not affect ACC (Hedges' g = -0.45, 95% CI [-0.93, 0.034]). Effects on RT were dose dependent. Significant between-study heterogeneity was found for both RT and ACC. Task sensitivity to executive functions moderated RT effects. Publication bias was evident, but the overall effect remained significant after adjustment for this. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis shows that psilocybin impairs executive functions and results in a slowing down of RT. We discuss potential neurochemical mechanisms underlying the observed effects as well as implications for the safe use of psilocybin in clinical and experimental contexts."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects 3.9% of the general population. While massed cognitive processing therapy (CPT) has demonstrated efficacy in treating chronic PTSD, a substantial proportion of patients still continue to meet PTSD criteria after treatment, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic approaches. Preliminary evidence supports the potential therapeutic action of psilocybin to alleviate PTSD symptoms. This open-label pilot study aims to evaluate the feasibility, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of a single dose 25 mg psilocybin in combination with one week of massed CPT in patients with chronic PTSD. METHOD: Fifteen participants with chronic PTSD will undergo 12 CPT sessions, two psilocybin-related psychotherapy sessions, and one psilocybin dosing session over a 7-days period. The primary outcomes are feasibility and tolerability, which will be measured by recruitment rates, withdrawal, data completion, adherence, number and nature of adverse events. Secondary objectives include assessing the preliminary efficacy of psilocybin-assisted CPT in reducing PTSD severity, self-reported treatment outcomes and exploring putative mechanisms of change. Participants will be monitored weekly for 12 weeks post-treatment and passive data relevant to mental health and well-being will be collected using a wearable device. DISCUSSION: This trial will generate important preliminary data on the use of psilocybin-assisted CPT for treating PTSD. The findings will guide the design of a multi-site, large-scale randomized control trial to more rigorously assess the efficacy of this intervention. De-identified data from this study will be available upon request after publication of the results. This study represents a promising and innovative approach to PTSD treatment, potentially offering an alternative therapeutic option for individuals unresponsive to conventional therapies.

      "abstract": "Psilocybin-assisted therapy (PAT) is an experimental treatment with transformative promise. Developing standards for PAT psychotherapy protocols is a priority, but psychotherapeutic protocol components of PAT have been subjected to little rigorous research. This study was designed to assess protocol components in a trial of PAT. The Enhanced Critical Incident Technique (E-CIT) was used to identify critical incidents in the treatment, wish list items comprising components or modifications that would have improved the treatment experience, and contributing factors that influenced the treatment. Participants included patients (n = 10), facilitators (n = 7 licensed mental health clinicians and certified spiritual health clinicians), and caregivers (n = 7) in an open-label trial investigating PAT for cancer-related demoralization and chronic pain. Patients and caregivers were interviewed after their last treatment session in the trial; facilitators were interviewed at the end of the entire trial. Rapid qualitative analysis identified specific domains for improvement in the treatment protocol based on the E-CIT. Critical incidents, wish list items, and contributing factors pertained to aspects of the therapy (e.g., importance of intention-setting) and the overall protocol (e.g., navigating transitions in the treatment). Findings indicate the importance of tailoring PAT to accommodate the medical history and needs of this population, support common factors, and ensure collaborative care. Recommendations across nine topic areas were derived from the data and presented in the Discussion. The E-CIT shows promise for advancing early stage research on PAT components.

METHODS: This was a randomized controlled trial that enrolled physicians and nurses with frontline clinical work during the COVID-19 pandemic and symptoms of depression and burnout. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either an 8-week MBSR curriculum alone or an 8-week MBSR curriculum plus group psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy (PAP) with 25mg psilocybin. Symptoms of depression and burnout were assessed at baseline, and 2-weeks and 6-months post intervention utilizing the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-SR-16) and Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey for Medical Professionals (MBI-HSS-MP), respectively. Secondary outcome measures included the Demoralization Scale (DS-II) and the Watt's Connectedness Scale (WCS). Adverse events and suicidality were assessed through 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: 25 participants were enrolled and randomized. There were 12 study-related AEs recorded that were Grade 1-2 and no serious AEs. There was larger decrease in QIDS score for the MBSR+PAP arm compared to MBSR-only from baseline to 2-weeks post-intervention and significant between-group differences favoring MBSR+PAP on subscales of the MBI-HSS-MP as well as the DS-II and WCS. CONCLUSIONS: Group psilocybin-assisted therapy plus MBSR was associated with clinically significant improvement in depressive symptoms without serious adverse events and with greater reduction in symptoms than MBSR alone. Study findings suggest that integrating psilocybin with mindfulness training may represent a promising treatment for depression and burnout among physicians and nurses."

Investigating the influence of psilocybin on the pathophysiological processes involved in MDD could enhance our neurobiological understanding of the presumed antidepressant action mechanism. This systematic review aims to summarize the results of human studies investigating changes in blood-based biomarkers of MDD to guide future research on potentially relevant analytes that could be monitored in clinical trials. A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science to retrieve studies investigating changes in serum and plasma levels of neurotrophic, immunologic, neuroendocrine, and metabolic markers. Nine studies were included, describing findings on 15 biomarkers, exclusively in healthy participants. Studies consistently reported a decrease in interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and eosinophils, and an increase in cortisol, prolactin, oxytocin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and free fatty acids following psilocybin administration. Less consistent effects were observed on interleukin-1β, interleukin-8, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, and growth hormone. The results are in line with preclinical studies and provide initial support from human studies that psilocybin potentially leads to beneficial effects on biomarkers of MDD. However, given the limited number of studies, findings should be approached with caution prior to replication. Further research should include larger samples, clinical populations, longer-term assessment, rigorous experimental designs, and account for the potential confounding of psychological stress related to the psychedelic experience.",

OBJECTIVES: This study focused on factors moderating changes in the acute and long-term effects of an individual psilocybin-assisted program on depression, anxiety, PTSD and personality structures by including demographic factors, subjective experience and degree of mystical type experiences during the dosing, as well as emotional breakthrough and personal growth after the program. METHODS: At baseline, 1 week and 3 months after the psilocybin program participants completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and NEO Five-Factor Inventory-3 (NEO-FFI-3). In addition, after the dosing the Mystical Experiences Questionnaire (MEQ-30), Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) and Emotional Breakthrough Inventory (EBI) were administered. Moderation effects were established using linear mixed-model analysis. RESULTS: A single high dose of psilocybin in combination with therapy was found to lower symptoms of anxiety, depression, PTSD and neuroticism over a period of 3-months. Scores on openness and conscientiousness increased after the treatment only. Participants reported mystical type experiences, emotional breakthrough and personal growth. These subjective experiences together with demographic factors were moderating the observed positive changes. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that individual psilocybin-assisted therapy has the potential for beneficial effects on mood and personality characteristics. Moreover, the study highlights the importance of subjective experiences and demographic factors in moderating this effect. This study adds to the ongoing research on psilocybin-assisted therapy by investigating contributing factors for optimizing this evolving type of therapy.",

However, the long-term effects of PT have never been compared with gold-standard treatments for MDD such as pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy alone or in combination. METHODS: This is a 6-month follow-up study of a phase 2, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial involving patients with moderate-to-severe MDD. Participants were recruited from a hospital in the UK. Male or female patients with major depressive disorder (DSM-IV), moderate to severe depression (HAM-D ≥17), no MRI or SSRI contraindications, confirmed diagnosis by a GP or mental healthcare professional, aged 18-80, and competent in English were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either two 25 mg doses of the psychedelic drug psilocybin administered orally combined with psychological support ('psilocybin therapy' or PT) and book-ended by further support or a 6-week course of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) escitalopram (administered daily at 10 mg for three weeks and 20 mg for the subsequent three weeks) plus matched psychological support ('escitalopram treatment' or ET). The primary outcome measure was change from baseline in the score on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR-16) at week 6, which has been reported previously. Herein, we present results at the 6-month follow-up time point. Measures of social functioning, connectedness, and meaning in life constituted the study's secondary outcomes during follow-up. Safety in the follow-up period was not assessed. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03429075. FINDINGS: Between January 15th, 2019 and March 20th, 2020, 59 patients were enrolled and 30 (11 females [37%] and 19 males [63%]) were assigned to the psilocybin group and 29 (9 females [31%] and 20 males [69%]) to the escitalopram group. 25 participants in the PT group and 21 in the ET group completed the 6-month follow-up. At the 6-month follow-up, both PT and ET conditions yielded sustained improvements in depressive symptom severity. The mean between-condition difference in QIDS-SR-16 scores at 6-months was 1.51 (95% CI: -1.35, 4.38; p = 0.311). Secondary outcomes demonstrated that PT had greater mean between-condition differences in functioning (WSAS: -7.46; 95% CI: -12.4, -2.47; p < 0.001), psychological connectedness (WCS: 11.02; 95% CI: 1.25, 20.83; p = 0.033), and meaning in life (MLQ: 4.86; 95% CI: 0.67, 9.05; p = 0.021) compared to ET. INTERPRETATION: Six-week intensive treatments with either psilocybin or escitalopram (with psychological support) for MDD were associated with long-term improvements in depressive symptom severity. The greater degree of improvement in the PT arm at follow-up on psychosocial functioning, meaning in life, and psychological connectedness suggests warrant future research. However, these results are descriptive and should be interpreted with caution. Key limitations of the study include its suboptimal power to detect small but meaningful differences between treatments, missing data, the potential use of additional interventions during the follow-up period, and reliance on self-reported treatment assessments. These factors may affect the interpretation of the study findings and should be considered when evaluating the results.

      "abstract": "Chronic stress exerts profound effects on mental health, contributing to disorders such as depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment. This study examines the potential of psilocybin to alleviate behavioral despair and cognitive deficits in a rodent model of chronic stress, focusing on the interplay between the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis and the Endocannabinoid System (ECS). Twenty-two male Wistar rats were divided into control and stress groups. Animals within the stress group were exposed to predator odor and chronic social instability to induce chronic stress, and were either sham treated, or given psilocybin. Behavioral assessments were conducted using the Open Field Test, Sucrose Preference Test, Novel Object Recognition, Elevated Plus Maze, and Forced Swimming Test to evaluate locomotion, anhedonia, memory, anxiety, and behavioral despair, respectively. Blood and brain samples were analyzed for biochemical markers. Results indicated that psilocybin significantly reduced stress-induced behavioral despair and cognitive impairments, likely through ECS-mediated downregulation of the HPA axis. These findings suggest that early intervention with psilocybin has sustained beneficial effects on stress-related behavioral and cognitive disturbances, underscoring its potential as a novel therapeutic approach for stress-related mental health disorders.",

This meta-analysis evaluates psilocybin's efficacy and safety in treating MDD to determine the optimal dose and timing for clinical trials. A systematic review and Dose-Response Network Meta-Analysis (NMA) of Randomized Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials (RCTs) registered with PROSPERO was conducted. Databases searched included Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, up to July 2024. The PICOS framework defined eligibility criteria: P: adult patients with MDD; I: psilocybin; C: placebo; O: changes in MADRS scores at Days 2, 8 and 15, and adverse events; S: RCT. Independent researchers performed data extraction and bias assessment. From 5419 search results, three RCTs involving 389 patients were included. Psilocybin significantly reduced symptoms compared to placebo at Day 8 (MD = -7.42; 95 % CI:10.07 to -4.78; p < 0.001) and Day 15 (MD = -9.55; 95 % CI:12.44 to -6.65; p < 0.001), without significant effects on Day 2. The NMA indicated that a 25 mg dose was the most effective, with a SUCRA value of 92.25 %, compared to doses of 0.215 mg/kg and 10 mg. However, psilocybin was associated with a higher risk of adverse events, particularly nausea (RR = 8.35; p < 0.001). This meta-analysis supports psilocybin's efficacy in treating MDD, particularly at a 25 mg dose, showing a time-dependent therapeutic effect. The recommended timing of efficacy evaluation by regulatory authorities is validated by this evidence, underscoring its importance in clinical trial design for psychedelic substances.",

However, such changes have yet to be characterized in disorders of addiction. In this secondary analysis from a randomized controlled trial, the authors examined the effect of PAT on personality dimensions in patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD), hypothesizing that PAT would attenuate personality abnormalities in AUD and that reductions in trait impulsiveness would be associated with lower drinking. METHODS: Eighty-four adults with AUD were randomized to two medication sessions of either psilocybin (N=44) or active placebo (diphenhydramine; N=40), received 12 weekly psychotherapy sessions, and completed follow-up for an additional 24 weeks. Changes in personality traits (week 36 vs. baseline) were assessed with the revised NEO Personality Inventory; daily alcohol consumption was quantified using the timeline followback. RESULTS: Relative to the placebo group, the psilocybin group showed significant reductions in neuroticism and increases in extraversion and openness. Secondary analyses showed that reductions in neuroticism were driven by decreases in the facets depression, impulsiveness, and vulnerability; increases in openness were driven by increases in the facets openness toward feelings and fantasy. Across all participants, decreases in impulsiveness were associated with lower posttreatment alcohol consumption, and an exploratory analysis revealed that these associations were strongest among psilocybin-treated participants who continued moderate- or high-risk drinking prior to the first medication session. CONCLUSIONS: PAT elicited durable shifts in personality, suggesting normalization of abnormal personality trait expression in AUD. Further study is needed to clarify whether PAT exerts its beneficial effects by reducing impulsiveness or whether impulsive individuals inherently respond better to PAT.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Depression varies along a difficulty-to-treat spectrum. Patients whose illness fails to respond to at least five treatments may be considered to have severely treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The objective of this study was to document the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in patients with severe TRD. METHODS: This was a 12-week, open-label trial conducted at Sheppard Pratt Hospital. Participants were 18-65 years of age, in a major depressive episode with documented insufficient benefit from at least five treatments during the current episode. A single dose of synthetic psilocybin (25 mg) was administered. Psychotropic medications were discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to dosing through at least 3 weeks post-dosing. Therapists met with patients for three sessions during pretreatment, during the 8-hour dosing day, and for three integration sessions posttreatment. The primary outcome measure was change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating scale (MADRS) at 3 weeks posttreatment. Secondary measures including MADRS scores up to 12 weeks posttreatment, and subject-rated scales capturing depression and level of function were completed at baseline and all subsequent visits. RESULTS: Twelve participants (six male, six female; mean age=40.6 years [SD=9.6]) with severe TRD were followed over the study period. Depressive symptoms were significantly decreased at week 3 (MADRS least-squares mean change=-15.8, 95% CI=-25.4 to -6.3) and Week 12 (MADRS least-squares mean change=-17.2, 95% CI=-25.2 to -9.1). In exploratory analyses, the Oceanic Boundlessness (OB) dimension of the psychedelic experience correlated with post-dosing antidepressant responses. Patients with comorbid PTSD (N=5) showed significantly less antidepressant effect of psilocybin. CONCLUSIONS: This open-label study suggests efficacy and safety of psilocybin in severe TRD and supports further study of psychedelics in this population, including consideration of PTSD interaction effects.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The authors critically examine the evidence base for psilocybin administered with psychological support/therapy (PST) in the treatment of psychiatric disorders and offer practical recommendations to guide future research endeavors. METHODS: PubMed was searched for English-language articles from January 1998 to November 2023, using the search term \"psilocybin.\" A total of 1,449 articles were identified and screened through titles and abstracts. Of these, 21 unique open-label or randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified that examine psilocybin for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (N=2), anxiety/depression associated with a cancer diagnosis (N=5), major depressive disorder (MDD; N=8), substance use disorders (N=4), anorexia (N=1), and demoralization (i.e., hopelessness, helplessness, and poor coping) in AIDS survivors (N=1). RESULTS: The most developed evidence base is for the treatment of MDD (three double-blind RCTs with positive signals spanning a range of severities). However, the evidence is tempered by threats to internal and external validity, including unsuccessful blinding, small samples, large variability in dosing and PST procedures, limited sample diversity, and possibly large expectancy effects. Knowledge of mechanisms of action and predictors of response is currently limited. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence is currently insufficient to recommend psilocybin with PST as a psychiatric treatment. Additional rigorously designed clinical trials are needed to definitively establish efficacy in larger and more diverse samples, address dosing considerations, improve blinding, and provide information on mechanisms of action and moderators of clinical response. Head-to-head comparisons with other evidence-based treatments will better inform the potential future role of psilocybin with PST in the treatment of major psychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract": "Eating disorders (EDs) are a group of debilitating mental illnesses characterized by maladaptive eating behaviors and severe cognitive-emotional dysfunction, directly affecting 1-3% of the population. Standard treatments are not effective in approximately one third of ED cases, representing the need for scientific advancement. There is emerging evidence for the safety and efficacy of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy (PAP) to improve treatment outcomes in individuals with EDs. However, the limited knowledge of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of PAP restricts the ability to confirm its clinical utility. This narrative review presents an overview of methodologies used to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms of EDs or the effects of psilocybin that could be employed to probe the neurobiological correlates of PAP in EDs, including magnetic resonance imaging and molecular neuroimaging techniques, electrophysiological approaches, and neuroplasticity markers. Finally, the implications of these methodologies are described in relation to the unique features of the psychedelic study design, challenges, limitations, and future directions to advance the field. This paper represents a valuable resource for scientists during study conceptualization and design phases and stimulates advancement in the identification of effective therapeutic interventions for EDs."

      "abstract": "There is renewed interest in psychedelics, such as psilocybin, as therapies for multiple difficult-to-treat psychiatric disorders. Even though psychedelics can induce highly pleasant or aversive experiences, depending on multiple personal and environmental factors, there is little research into how such experiences impact post-acute mood-altering actions. Here we aimed at offsetting this gap. First, we tested whether acute psilocybin effects differed between sexes. Adult male and female C57BL/6J mice received saline or psilocybin (5 mg/kg; i.p.), and head-twitch response (HTR) frequency was quantified. Notably, while psilocybin increased HTR frequency in both sexes, the effect was greater in females. We then tested if stress exposure during acute drug effects impacted post-acute psilocybin actions. Following drug treatment, mice were returned to their homecage or restrained for 1 h. Anxiety- and depression-like behaviors were assessed starting 24 h following drug administration, using the marble burying, novelty-suppressed feeding, and splash tests. Psilocybin induced anxiolytic-, but not antidepressant-like, which were fully blocked by stress in males, but only partially so in females. Lastly, we assessed the acute stress-psilocybin interaction on plasma corticosterone levels in a separate cohort of mice, treated as above. Both stress and psilocybin independently increased corticosterone levels, without additive or interactive effects being observed for either sex. Our data reveals the role of sex and peri-acute negative experiences in the acute and post-acute actions of psilocybin. These findings underline the importance of non-pharmacological factors, such as the quality of the psychedelic experience, in the mood-altering effects of psychedelics, holding significant for both their therapeutic and recreational use.",

Current treatments, including psychosocial therapies and residential rehabilitation, face limitations such as high relapse rates, cost, and accessibility issues. As a result, there is an urgent need for novel approaches to treat MA dependence that are effective, affordable, and accessible to patients. Psilocybin, the active component in numerous mushrooms of the Psilocybe genus, has shown potential for enhancing psychotherapy for various addiction and mental health issues due to its effects on perception, cognition, and affect. Psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy (PAT) has demonstrated initial safety and efficacy in treating alcohol, cocaine, and nicotine dependence. The case presented here describes a 36-year-old transwoman and daily MA user, who participated in a single-arm open-label clinical trial assessing feasibility and safety of PAT for MA dependence at St. Vincent's Hospital, Sydney. Following inpatient withdrawal management and one session of psilocybin-assisted therapy, she experienced significant cognitive and emotional shifts and sustained MA abstinence. She reported improved mental health over 3 months following treatment completion. She also noted increased self-esteem, mindfulness, and distress tolerance. This study suggests that PAT (following inpatient MA withdrawal management) may offer a scalable, safe, and effective approach for treating MA dependence. However, further research is required to confirm the generalisability and efficacy of PAT for broader populations of people using MA. It is encouraging that this participant, a daily MA user, showed improvements in mood and cognition, in addition to abstinence from MA."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationships between psilocybin dose, psychedelic experiences, and therapeutic outcome in treatment-resistant depression. METHODS: For treatment-resistant depression, 233 participants received a single dose of 25, 10, or 1 mg of COMP360 psilocybin (a proprietary, pharmaceutical-grade synthesized psilocybin formulation, developed by the sponsor, Compass Pathfinder Ltd.) with psychological support. The resulting psychedelic experience (Five-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire [5D-ASC] and Emotional Breakthrough Inventory [EBI]) were measured. These proximal variables and outcome 3 weeks post-administration (change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS]) were explored using correlation analysis. RESULTS: The mean intensity of psychedelic effects was dose-related, but distributions of scores for different doses overlapped considerably. Depression response correlated with select aspects of the psychedelic experience overall and for individual doses. At the 25 mg dose, 5D-ASC dimensions Oceanic Boundlessness (Pearson correlation coefficient r = -0.508) and Visual Restructuralization (r = -0.516), and EBI (r = -0·637) were the variables with the strongest correlation to the Week 3 change from Baseline in MADRS score. LIMITATIONS: The existence of correlation does not establish causation and exploratory findings require further replication, preferably in larger independent samples. CONCLUSIONS: The intensity of psychedelic experience overlaps widely across doses and mitigates the risk of unblinding to dose. Correlations between psychedelic experience and outcome suggest specificity in psilocybin's mechanism of action. Quality and intensity of psychedelic experience may be a measure of pharmacodynamic effect and reveal an effective dose response phenomenon for single oral doses.",

      "abstract": "Empathy plays a crucial role in interpersonal relationships and mental health. It is decreased in a variety of psychiatric disorders including major depression. Psilocybin, a promising candidate for treating depression, has been shown to acutely increase emotional empathy in healthy volunteers. However, no study has investigated this effect and its relevance for symptom improvement in a clinical population. This study examines the enduring effects of psilocybin-assisted therapy on empathy in depressed patients using a randomized, placebo-controlled design. Fifty-one depressed patients were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of psilocybin (0215 mg/kg body weight) or a placebo embedded in a 4-week psychological support intervention. Empathy was measured using the Multifaceted Empathy Test at baseline and 2 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks after substance administration. Changes in empathy were compared between treatment conditions. Patients who received psilocybin showed significant improvements in explicit emotional empathy driven by an increase in empathy towards positive stimuli compared to the placebo group for at least two weeks. This study highlights the potential of psychedelics to enhance social cognition in individuals living with depression and contributes to a better understanding of the psychological mechanisms of action of psychedelics. Further studies are necessary to investigate the interaction between social cognition and clinical efficacy.The trial is registered on clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT03715127) and KOFAM (Identifier: SNCTP000003139)."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Psilocybin, a classical psychedelic, has been rescheduled for use in psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for treatment-resistant depression in Australia. While evidence for its use is promising, understanding the associated risks is crucial. Accordingly, this review aims to collate adverse event data from psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy clinical trials and evaluate its definition, way of measurement and reporting. METHODS: A systematic method was employed to identify clinical trials related to the use of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in clinical populations that reported on adverse events. The quality assessment focused on relevant criteria related to adverse event definition, monitoring and reporting methods. RESULTS: A total of 24 articles were included. The studies reported heterogeneous psilocybin doses, study designs and indications. Physical and psychological adverse events during and after psilocybin sessions were examined, revealing variations in measuring, reporting methods and occurrences. The most common adverse events during and after sessions included elevated blood pressure, headaches, nausea, vomiting, fatigue and anxiety. In addition, both suicidal ideation and behaviour were observed infrequently and mainly in participants with a history of suicidal ideation or suicide attempt(s). CONCLUSION: The review highlights the need to standardise the defintion of an adverse event, including how they are measured and reported, in psychedelic clinical trials to ensure consistent reporting across studies. In addition, screening participants for suicidality history and ongoing monitoring remains important, given the potential risk identified in the literature. However, based on the available data, the safety of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy is generally supported, and no deaths were attributed to psilocybin. Nevertheless, cautious optimism is needed due to the preliminary nature and heterogeneity of the safety data.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Psilocybin is being investigated as a treatment for a myriad of disorders, including treatment-resistant depression. The main focus has been on positive effects, with little attention paid to negative outcomes, especially in clinical settings. Quantitative methodology limits further exploration of such events and can also miss improvements not captured on rating scales. AIMS: To highlight potential adverse events of psilocybin and underline limits of quantitative methodology, calling for process evaluations alongside clinical trials. CASE PRESENTATION: This is a case of a participant in a phase 2b clinical trial of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression who presented with increased suicidal ideation and a prolonged period of severely restricted eating following administration, leading to a period of destabilisation and a need for support. Despite the difficulties encountered and the participant's limited improvement on rating scales, she found the experience to have been helpful and led her to make changes to her life which she found beneficial. She described her experience in a written account to the authors. METHOD: The case was summarised and the written account was thematically analysed and synthesised into a logic model. CONCLUSIONS: Psilocybin could lead to temporary worsening of suicidal ideation and instigate prolonged adverse events that outlast its acute effects. Paradoxically, it could simultaneously lead to an improvement in functional outcomes which is not clear on depression rating scales. This calls for a qualitative exploration of serious adverse events and participant accounts to deepen our understanding of the psilocybin experience and its different outcomes."

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: The psychological morbidity experienced by physicians, advanced practice practitioners (APPs), and nurses from working during the COVID-19 pandemic includes burnout, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether psilocybin therapy could improve symptoms of depression, burnout, and PTSD in US clinicians who developed these symptoms from frontline clinical work during the pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This double-blind randomized clinical trial enrolled participants from February to December 2022. Participants included physicians, APPs, and nurses who provided frontline care for more than 1 month during the pandemic and had no prepandemic mental health diagnoses but had moderate or severe symptoms of depression at enrollment. Participants were randomly assigned to either the psilocybin or niacin arm. Data analysis was conducted between December 2023 and May 2024 and was based on the intention-to-treat principle. INTERVENTION: One intervention episode consisted of 2 preparation visits, 1 medication session, and 3 integration visits. At the medication session, participants received psilocybin, 25 mg, or niacin, 100 mg, orally. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a change from baseline (preparation 1 session) to day 28 (after medication administration) in symptoms of depression as measured by the clinician-administered Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) used by blinded raters. The secondary outcomes were a change in symptoms of burnout (measured with the Stanford Professional Fulfillment Index [SPFI]) and symptoms of PTSD (measured with the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition [PCL-5]). RESULTS: A total of 30 clinicians (15 females [50%]; mean [range] age, 38 [29-60] years) participated, of whom 15 were randomly assigned to receive psilocybin and 15 to receive niacin. The mean change in symptoms of depression (MADRS scores) from preparation 1 session to day 28 was -21.33 (7.84) in the psilocybin arm compared with -9.33 (7.32) in the niacin arm, with a mean difference between arms of -12.00 (95% CI, -17.67 to -6.33; P < .001), a decrease in MADRS scores indicating improvement. The mean change in SPFI scores from preparation 1 session to day 28 showed a numerically larger improvement in symptoms of burnout in the psilocybin compared with the niacin arm (-6.40 [5.00] vs -2.33 [5.97]; P = .05) but was not statistically significant. Since the SPFI score change did not reach statistical significance, the PCL-5 score change was evaluated descriptively. The mean change in PCL-5 scores showed a numerically larger decrease in symptoms of PTSD from preparation 1 session to day 28 in the psilocybin vs the niacin arm (-16.67 [15.04] vs -6.73 [10.69]), but this difference was not statistically tested. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial found that psilocybin therapy resulted in a significant, sustained reduction in symptoms of depression experienced by clinicians after frontline work during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings establish psilocybin therapy as a new paradigm of treatment for this postpandemic condition. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05163496.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Treatment with so-called psychedelic drugs, including psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and others, is among the most promising recent developments in psychiatry. This review focuses on psilocybin, a substance found in all mushrooms of the genus Psilocybe, because the largest amount of available evidence relates to this drug. METHODS: This review is based on pertinent publications (since 1969) that were retrieved by a selective search carried out in August 2024 in the PubMed and ScienceDirect databases employing the keywords \"psilocybin\" AND \"long-term effects\" AND \"mental disorders\", with an emphasis on randomized, controlled clinical trials (RCTs). RESULTS: The available RCTs document the efficacy of psilocybin mainly against depression, including otherwise medically refratory depression. Most of the trials revealed a strong effect, with Cohen's d ranging from 0.67 to 2.6; they used a variety of depression scales and follow-up intervals. Evidence was also found for the efficacy of psilocybin against substance use disorders (alcohol in particular) and symptoms of anxiety accompanying life-threatening somatic illnesses, such as cancer. Initial uncontrolled studies have also shown significant improvement after the administration of psilocybin for other indications. CONCLUSION: Treatment with psilocybin differs fundamentally from classic psychopharmacotherapy. Its potentially transdiagnostic, rapid, and sustainable efficacy and its positive effect on further dimensions of mental health beyond the patient's symptoms and psychopathology imply that it may have diseasemodifying and salutogenic mechanisms of action. Psychotherapy accompanied by the administration of psychedelic drugs may turn out to be the first disease-modifying treatment in the history of psychiatry.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There is growing interest in the use of psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT) for major depressive disorder (MDD), including treatment-resistant depression. We used randomized controlled trial (RCT) data to compare summary estimates of change in depression ratings with PAT versus comparator treatments in MDD. We also compared response and remission rates, and adverse effects. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and SCOPUS from inception till April 2024. Our primary efficacy outcome was 1-week (or nearest) between-group change in depression ratings. Secondary efficacy outcomes were changes in depression ratings at days 2, 14, and 42 (or nearest) and study-defined response and remission rates at week 1 (or nearest). Safety outcomes were reported adverse effects. We pooled outcomes in random-effects meta-analyses using standardized mean difference (SMD; Hedges g) for continuous outcomes and risk ratio (RR) for categorical outcomes. RESULTS: We found 6 eligible RCTs (pooled N = 427), all on psilocybin. The pooled SMD for 1-week between-group change in depression ratings was -0.72 [95% CI, -0.95 to -0.49; I2 = 17%; 5 RCTs; n = 403], favouring PAT; results were similar at days 2, 14, and 42. The response [RR = 3.42; 95% CI, 2.35-4.97; I2 = 0%; 4 RCTs; n = 373] and remission [RR = 3.66; 95% CI, 2.26-5.92; I2 = 0%; 4 RCTs; n = 373] rates also favored PAT. The PAT group had a small but significantly increased risk of developing any adverse event [RR = 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.42; I2 = 43%; 4 RCTs; n = 373] and a significantly higher risk of experiencing headache [RR = 1.78; 95% CI, 1.10-2.86; I2 = 52%; 4 RCTs; n = 373] and dizziness [RR = 6.52; 95% CI, 1.19-35.87; I2 = 0%; 3 RCTs; n = 269]. Low heterogeneity characterized most analyses and findings were similar in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: Antidepressant effects of psilocybin-assisted therapy are superior (with at least medium effect sizes) to comparator interventions for at least up to 6 weeks postintervention."

This review primarily explores the utility of preclinical animal models in investigating the potential of psilocybin as an anti-nociceptive agent. Initial studies involving psilocybin in animal models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain are summarised, alongside areas where further research is needed. The potential mechanisms of action, including targeting serotonergic pathways through the activation of 5-HT2A receptors at both spinal and central levels, as well as neuroplastic actions that improve functional connectivity in brain regions involved in chronic pain, are considered. Current clinical aspects and the translational potential of psilocybin from animal models to chronic pain patients are reviewed. Also discussed is psilocybin's profile as an ideal anti-nociceptive agent, with a wide range of effects against chronic pain and its associated inflammatory or emotional components."

      "abstract": "Psychedelics are currently undergoing a scientific renaissance, with modern studies investigating therapeutic efficacy of psychedelic-assisted therapy in a range of psychiatric conditions. In particular, psilocybin-assisted therapy (PAT) has been suggested to have positive effects on patients suffering from depression and psychiatric distress associated with life-threatening disease - contexts with growing needs for alternative treatments - in a therapeutic setting involving fewer doses and less important adverse effect compared to that of classic psychotrope administration. Psychedelics are partial agonists of the serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) G protein-coupled receptors, whose activation likely mediates the acute psychoactive effects. Furthermore, psychedelics seem to induce a hyper-plastic state which allows for adaptation of inflexible pathological thinking patterns. Post-acutely, they are suggested to induce rapid, robust and sustained neuroplasticity. Eight clinical PAT trials have been conducted between January 1st 2001 and March 31st 2023 and are reviewed here. Five of them evaluate the effect on depressive symptomatology in an otherwise general population. The other three evaluate effect on depression and anxiety in patients suffering from somatic life-threatening disease. The studies reviewed here show that PAT is safe and feasible to administer in current clinical models. Preliminary efficacy shows significant improvements in depressive and anxious symptomatology which are immediate and partially sustained. One study comparing PAT to selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitors showed no significant difference of efficacy between the two treatments. Preliminary results regarding efficacy of PAT on mood disorders are promising, but further research is warranted for stronger inferences, with a particular focus on larger, multicentric studies, more diverse populations and a stronger control for expectancy and unblinding.",

Psilocybin and MDMA may become approved medicines in the coming decade. This study assessed knowledge and attitudes regarding PAT among 879 U.S. healthcare professionals via anonymous online survey. Multivariable linear regression was used to identify predictors of openness to clinical use. Most participants (71.2%) were female and White (85.8%), with a mean (SD) age of 45.5 (12.7) years. Registered nurses (25.4%) and physicians (17.7%) comprised the largest professional groups. Respondents endorsed strong belief in therapeutic promise, and moderate openness to clinical use and support for legal access to both substances, with higher overall ratings for psilocybin compared to MDMA. Objective knowledge items revealed low knowledge of therapeutic uses, risks, and pharmacology. Primary concerns were lack of trained providers, financial cost, and potential contraindications. Prior psychedelic use, self-rated knowledge, younger age, and professional role predicted openness to clinical use of psilocybin and MDMA, with physicians reporting lower openness. As psychedelics continue to garner popular and scientific interest, results indicate a pressing need for additional formal training to provide balanced, evidence-based information from trusted sources.",

In this study, we investigated the multifaceted aspects of psilocybin, highlighting its chemical properties, mechanisms of action, and burgeoning role in psychiatric treatment. Furthermore, we examined the clinical applications and potential therapeutic benefits of psilocybin in the treatment of various mental health disorders, supported by accumulating clinical evidence. This review aims to deepen our understanding of the clinical impact of psilocybin, elucidate its therapeutic value, and propose directions for future research, thereby paving the way for its integration into mainstream psychiatric treatments. Psilocybin has been shown to be safe in clinical trials with manageable side effects. However, additional safety measures are required after this discussion, including dosing protocols, patient monitoring, and distress management strategies."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Negative perceptions of psilocybin and challenges of participant enrollment may represent barriers to conducting a randomized controlled trial examining psilocybin for chronic neuropathic pain. AIM: Prior to trial initiation, we aimed to examine patient attitudes toward the trial via a prospective preference assessment. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with chronic neuropathic pain participated in a prospective preference assessment comprising quantitative (survey) and qualitative (interview) components. Content analysis was used to inductively and deductively identify factors that would motivate or discourage participation in the proposed trial. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and perceptions of psilocybin were collected to explore differences in characteristics between patients who were willing and unwilling to participate. RESULTS: Survey results showed that most participants (76.9%) were willing to participate in the PEACE-PAIN trial. \"Willing\" participants reported higher prior psychedelic use (75%) as compared to the \"maybe willing\" (0%) and \"not willing\" participants (0%). Interviews indicated that the top two factors that motivated participation included the need for new treatment options (31.7%) and benefits to personal pain management (31.7%). The top two discouraging factors included practical difficulties of research participation (16.7%), and adverse events associated with psilocybin (16.7%). CONCLUSIONS: The PEACE-PAIN trial study design is supported by patient survey responses but may benefit from modifications, namely incorporating thorough discussions of the current evidence for efficacy, safety, tolerability, and approaches to address adverse effects of psilocybin. Additionally, the interest in participation by individuals with prior psychedelic use holds important methodological implications for the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the trial."

We sought to explore the literature on sleep and psilocybin use, and explore the topic using our own primary data. FINDINGS: Whilst clinical trials demonstrate large depressive symptom improvements, the impact of psilocybin on sleep quality or insomnia symptoms, has not been directly studied. Using our own preliminary-data we demonstrated that both depressive-symptoms and sleep-disturbances decreased significantly following psilocybin use, though sleep improvements were smaller compared to depressive symptoms. More severe sleep-disturbances at baseline were linked to lower probability of depression remission, underscoring a potential interaction between sleep and psilocybin's efficacy. Addressing sleep disturbances could enhance therapeutic outcomes in psilocybin-assisted therapy and could lead to more effective, personalized treatment-strategies. Future research should focus on populations with sleep disorders, and on examining causal-pathways of sleep physiology's impact on psilocybin efficacy.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Understanding variations in knowledge and attitudes of psychiatrists to psilocybin therapy is important for the collective discourse about the potential impact on clinical practice and public health in Ireland. METHODS: A 28-item questionnaire was designed based on previous studies and distributed to psychiatrists in Ireland via online mailing lists and at in-person academic events. RESULTS: 151 psychiatrists completed the questionnaire (73.3% were under 40 years of age, 76.0% were trainees, and 49.0% were female). In the total sample, 81.5% agreed that psilocybin therapy shows promise in the treatment of psychiatric disorders and 86.8% supported funding research, 86.8% would be willing to refer a patient if it was licensed and indicated, and 78.1% would consider the treatment for themselves, if indicated. Conversely, 6.6% agreed that psilocybin therapy was unsafe even under medical supervision, and 21.9% thought it was potentially addictive. 15.9% of the total sample reported at least one concern including, lack of robust evidence, long-term effectiveness, superiority to current interventions, potential harmful effects, cost and accessibility, and impartiality. Less than half of respondents felt knowledgeable (40.0%) and 9.9% felt adequately prepared to participate in psilocybin therapy. Consultant psychiatrists trended towards less optimism for a potential role in bipolar depression and emotionally unstable personality disorder compared to trainee psychiatrists. CONCLUSION: Overall psychiatrists in Ireland held positive attitudes towards psilocybin therapy. However, there was a lack of knowledge evident. Addressing the knowledge gap and aligning with the best available evidence will be key if psychedelic therapy is to prevail in a clinical setting."

      "abstract": "Psilocybin is a serotonergic psychedelic compound which shows promise for treating compulsive behaviours. This is particularly pertinent as compulsive disorders require research into new pharmacological treatment options as the current frontline treatments such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, require chronic administration, have significant side effects, and leave almost half of the clinical population refractory to treatment. In this study, we investigated psilocybin administration in male and female SAPAP3 knockout (KO) mice, a well-validated mouse model of obsessive compulsive and related disorders. We assessed the effects of acute psilocybin (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) administration on head twitch and locomotor behaviour as well as anxiety- and compulsive-like behaviours at multiple time-points (1, 3 and 8 days post-injection). While psilocybin did not have any effect on anxiety-like behaviours, we revealed that acute psilocybin administration led to enduring reductions in compulsive behaviour in male SAPAP3 KO mice and reduced grooming behaviour in female wild-type (WT) and SAPAP3 KO mice. We also found that psilocybin increased locomotion in WT littermates but not in SAPAP3 KO mice, suggesting in vivo serotonergic dysfunctions in KO animals. On the other hand, the typical head-twitch response following acute psilocybin (confirming its hallucinogenic-like effect at this dose) was observed in both genotypes. Our novel findings suggest that acute psilocybin may have potential to reduce compulsive-like behaviours (up to 1 week after a single injection). Our study can inform future research directions as well as supporting the utility of psilocybin as a novel treatment option for compulsive disorders.",

Psilocybin has been designated a 'Breakthrough Therapy' by the US Food and Drug Administration, and therefore a sustainable production process must be established to meet future market demands. Here, we present the development of an in vivo psilocybin production chassis based on repression of l-tryptophan catabolism. We demonstrate the proof of principle in Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing the psilocybin biosynthetic genes. Deletion of the two aminotransferase genes ARO8/9 and the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase gene BNA2 yielded a fivefold increase of psilocybin titre. We transferred this knowledge to the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans and identified functional ARO8/9 orthologs involved in fungal l-tryptophan catabolism by genome mining and cross-complementation. The double deletion mutant of A. nidulans resulted in a 10-fold increased psilocybin production. Process optimization based on respiratory activity measurements led to a final psilocybin titre of 267 mg/L in batch cultures with a space-time-yield of 3.7 mg/L/h. These results demonstrate the suitability of our engineered A. nidulans to serve as a production strain for psilocybin and other tryptamine-derived pharmaceuticals.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Due to the unsatisfactory therapeutic effects of current antidepressants, research has been launched into alternative treatment approaches, such as the administration of psychedelics. Psilocybin, a classic hallucinogen, has been shown to exert considerable positive influence on depression symptoms through its serotonergic and glutamatergic effects. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of psilocybin in treating depression. METHODS: A comprehensive search of Medline (via PubMed) and the Cochrane Library databases was conducted to identify relevant studies. Inclusion criteria were applied to select studies that investigated the therapeutic impact of psilocybin on depression. A mixed-effects multi-level model was used to estimate the overall effect size. Effectiveness over time was also investigated as a secondary analysis. RESULTS: The results of the primary analysis revealed a large and clinically observable reduction (SMC: -1.24, 95%CI: -1.83 to -0.65, I2level2 = 11.39%, I2level3 = 77.67%) of depressive symptomatology in patients receiving psilocybin in addition to supportive therapy compared to baseline measurements. The decrease was also marked when compared to placebo (p-value = 0.032). The results remained significant even when a secondary analysis assessed the effect in various time intervals since the administration of psilocybin. CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis substantiate the claim that psilocybin is superior in treating depression compared to established psychotherapy alone used for treating depression. This finding warrants further studies with larger sample sizes and across a longer timeframe."

In this pioneering study, we evaluated the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of psilocybin-assisted frontal-midline theta neurofeedback (NF), a neuromodulation technique leveraging neuroplasticity, to improve executive functions (EFs). Thirty-seven eligible participants were randomized into an experimental group (n = 18) and a passive control group (n = 19). The experimental group underwent three microdose sessions and then three psilocybin-assisted NF sessions, without requiring psychological support, demonstrating the approach's feasibility. NF learning showed a statistical trend for increases in frontal-midline theta from session to session with a large effect size and non-significant but medium effect size dynamical changes within sessions. Placebo effects were consistent across groups, with no tasks-based EF improvements, but significant self-reported gains in daily EFs-working memory, shifting, monitoring and inhibition-showing medium and high effect sizes. The experimental group's significant gains in their key training goals underscored the approach's external relevance. A thorough study with regular sessions and an active control group is crucial to evaluate EFs improvement and their specificity in future. Psilocybin-enhanced NF could offer significant, lasting benefits across diagnoses, improving daily functioning.

As evidence is only available from small or uncontrolled samples, this post hoc analysis investigated this using data from the largest, phase II, randomized controlled trial of psilocybin treatment to date. Data from 233 participants with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) who received 25 mg, 10 mg, or 1 mg of investigational drug COMP360 psilocybin (a proprietary, pharmaceutical-grade synthetic psilocybin formulation, developed by the sponsor, Compass Pathfinder Ltd.), administered with psychological support, were compared for groups of participants who either discontinued one or more antidepressant drugs during screening or entered the trial antidepressant drug free. Measures of depression symptom severity change during the antidepressant drug discontinuation period, baseline suicidality, acute subjective psychedelic effects, and the study's primary endpoint (change in depression symptom severity between Baseline and Week 3) are described for both groups. Antidepressant drug discontinuation was not related to worsening of depression severity before Baseline. Suicidality was comparable between groups at Baseline. Psilocybin treatment efficacy and the subjective psychedelic experience did not appear to be compromised by antidepressant drug discontinuation. Thus, it does not limit the feasibility of psilocybin treatment for the future. These findings also support the overall homogeneity of our findings with psilocybin treatment as a monotherapy for TRD. The prior contradictory reports may come to appear misleading.",

Individuals with risk factors for psychosis are typically excluded from such studies, limiting the empiric research of the risks and benefits in vulnerable populations. In the real-world setting, many individuals who seek treatment with psilocybin will have comorbid psychiatric conditions and other factors that predispose them to psychosis. We report a case of a patient with multiple predisposing risk factors, including a history of depression, personality disorder traits, and cannabis use, who experienced a psychotic episode with catatonic features and suicidality after several months of heavy psilocybin use. A review of similar previously published case reports demonstrates a pattern of psilocybin-induced psychosis occurring primarily in individuals with predisposing factors who have consumed either high or repeated doses of the drug. This case report furthers this pattern, which serves as both a warning that psilocybin use is not without risks and reassurance for researchers using much lower doses to treat mental illness."

      "abstract": "In recent decades, psilocybin has gained attention as a potential drug for several mental disorders. Clinical and preclinical studies have provided evidence that psilocybin can be used as a fast-acting antidepressant. However, the exact mechanisms of action of psilocybin have not been clearly defined. Data show that psilocybin as an agonist of 5-HT2A receptors located in cortical pyramidal cells exerted a significant effect on glutamate (GLU) extracellular levels in both the frontal cortex and hippocampus. Increased GLU release from pyramidal cells in the prefrontal cortex results in increased activity of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons and, consequently, increased release of the GABA neurotransmitter. It seems that this mechanism appears to promote the antidepressant effects of psilocybin. By interacting with the glutamatergic pathway, psilocybin seems to participate also in the process of neuroplasticity. Therefore, the aim of this mini-review is to discuss the available literature data indicating the impact of psilocybin on glutamatergic neurotransmission and its therapeutic effects in the treatment of depression and other diseases of the nervous system.",

      "abstract": "Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a highly prevalent disorder that causes serious disability. Available treatments leave 40% or more of people with OCD significantly symptomatic. There is an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches. Mice that carry a homozygous deletion of the SAPAP3 gene (SAPAP3 KO) manifest a phenotype of excessive self-grooming, tic-like head-body twitches and anxiety. These behaviors closely resemble pathological self-grooming behaviors observed in humans in conditions that overlap with OCD. Following a preliminary report that the tryptaminergic psychedelic, psilocybin, may reduce symptoms in patients with OCD, we undertook a randomized controlled trial of psilocybin in 50 SAPAP3 KO mice (28 male, 22 female). Mice that fulfilled inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to a single intraperitoneal injection of psilocybin (4.4 mg/kg), psychedelic mushroom extract (encompassing the same psilocybin dose) or vehicle control and were evaluated after 2, 12, and 21 days by a rater blind to treatment allocation for grooming characteristics, head-body twitches, anxiety, and other behavioral features. Mice treated with vehicle (n = 18) manifested a 118.71 ± 95.96% increase in total self-grooming (the primary outcome measure) over the 21-day observation period. In contrast, total self-grooming decreased by 14.60 ± 17.90% in mice treated with psilocybin (n = 16) and by 19.20 ± 20.05% in mice treated with psychedelic mushroom extract (n = 16) (p = 0.001 for effect of time; p = 0.0001 for time × treatment interaction). Five mice were dropped from the vehicle group because they developed skin lesions; 4 from the psilocybin group and none from the psychedelic mushroom extract group. Secondary outcome measures such as head-body twitches and anxiety all showed a significant improvement over 21 days. Notably, in mice that responded to psilocybin (n = 12) and psychedelic mushroom extract (n = 13), the beneficial effect of a single treatment persisted up to 7 weeks. Mice initially treated with vehicle and non-responsive, showed a clear and lasting therapeutic response when treated with a single dose of psilocybin or psychedelic mushroom extract and followed for a further 3 weeks. While equivalent to psilocybin in overall effect on self-grooming, psychedelic mushroom extract showed superior effects in alleviating head-body twitches and anxiety. These findings strongly justify clinical trials of psilocybin in the treatment of OCD and further studies aimed at elucidating mechanisms that underlie the long-term effects to alleviate excessive self-grooming observed in this study.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Psilocybin is a psychedelic 5HT2A receptor agonist found in \"magic mushrooms\". Recent studies have indicated that 5HT2A agonists, such as dimethyltryptamine, given before middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo), improve staircase behavior, increased BDNF expression, and reduce brain infarction in stroke rats. The objective of this study is to determine the protective effect of psilocybin in cellular and animal models of stroke. METHODS: Adult male and timed-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were used for this study. The neural protective effects of psilocybin were determined in primary rat cortical neurons and adult rats. Rats were subjected to a 60-min middle cerebral artery occlusion. Brain tissues were collected for histological and qRTPCR analysis. RESULTS: Psilocybin reduced glutamate-mediated neuronal loss in rat primary cortical neuronal cultures. Psilocybin-mediated protection in culture was antagonized by the BDNF inhibitor ANA12. Pretreatment with psilocybin reduced brain infarction and neurological deficits in stroke rats. Early post-treatment with psilocybin improved locomotor behavior, upregulated the expression of MAP2 and synaptophysin, and down-regulated the expression of IBA1 in the stroke brain. ANA12 significantly attenuated psilocybin-mediated reduction in brain infarction and improvements in locomotor behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Psilocybin reduced brain infarction and improved locomotor behavior in stroke rats; the protective mechanisms involve regulating BDNF expression. Our data support a novel therapeutic approach of psilocybin in stroke.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Promising studies show that psilocybin-assisted therapy relieves existential distress in patients with serious illnesses, a difficult condition to treat with current treatment options. There is growing interest in this therapy in palliative care. Canada recently amended its laws to allow physicians to request psilocybin for end-of-life distress. However, barriers to access remain. Since implementing psilocybin-assisted therapy within palliative care depends on the attitudes of healthcare providers willing to recommend it, they should be actively engaged in the broader discussion about this treatment option. We aimed (1) to identify issues and concerns regarding the acceptability of this therapy among palliative care professionals and to discuss ways of remedying them and (2) to identify factors that may facilitate access. METHODS: A qualitative study design and World Café methodology were adopted to collect data. The event was held on April 24, 2023, with 16 palliative care professionals. The data was analyzed following an inductive approach. RESULTS: Although participants were interested in psilocybin-assisted therapy, several concerns and needs were identified. Educational and certified training needs, medical legalization of psilocybin, more research, refinement of therapy protocols, reflections on the type of professionals dispensing the therapy, the treatment venue, and eligibility criteria for treatment were discussed. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Palliative care professionals consider psilocybin-assisted therapy a treatment of interest, but it generates several concerns. According to our results, the acceptability of the therapy and the expansion of its access seem interrelated. The development of guidelines will be essential to encourage wider therapy deployment.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of psilocybin in adult patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). METHODS: A systematic search (up to September 14, 2023) was conducted for RCTs that examined the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of psilocybin in physically healthy adult patients with MDD. Three independent researchers extracted data from publications where the primary outcome was a change in depressive symptoms, and key secondary outcomes were changes in anxiety symptoms and suicidal ideation, discontinuation rates for any reason, and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). RESULTS: Five RCTs with 472 adult patients with MDD on psilocybin (n = 274) and controls (n = 198) were included. Two of the five RCTs (40%) reported mixed results, while the other three (60%) found that psilocybin had a beneficial effect on MDD treatment. Four RCTs (80%) assessing the anxiolytic effects of psilocybin for treating MDD found that psilocybin was significantly more effective than the control group in improving anxiety symptoms. Psilocybin was more effective than the control group in improving suicidal ideation in one out of five RCTs. Discontinuation rates were similar for any reason between the psilocybin group (2-13%) and the control group (4-21%) (P > 0.05). Four RCTs (80%) reported ADRs in detail. The most common ADR in both groups was headache. CONCLUSION: Psilocybin was effective in improving depressive symptoms in over half of the included studies and reduced anxiety symptoms in patients with MDD. The long-term efficacy and safety of psilocybin for MDD treatment needs to be further investigated in large RCTs."

We performed a meta-analysis and systematic review on the correlation of subjective symptoms and dissociation versus ketamine-induced therapeutic outcomes in patients with depression or SUD. A similar analysis was conducted for psilocybin-induced therapeutic improvement. We retrieved 23 papers studying ketamine (21 on depression, 2 on SUD) in 471 patients and 8 papers studying psilocybin (6 on depression, 2 on SUD) in 183 patients. Our study demonstrated a modest role for subjective effects mediating therapeutic outcomes, with R2-values ranging from 5-10% for ketamine and for psilocybine the R2 was 24%. A greater mediating effect for psilocybin compared to ketamine was detected, particularly when restricting the analysis to depression. Additionally there is a greater mediating effect in SUD than depression, irrespective of treatment."

We explore psilocybin as a potential treatment option for PTSD by examining the neurobiology of PTSD as well as psilocybin's mechanism of action.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIM: Treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) has remained largely unchanged and focuses primarily on symptomatic relief through activation of dopaminergic pathways. Currently, there are no proven prophylactic approaches to the prevention of PD. This systematic review seeks to compare two separate compounds, metformin (MTF) and psilocybin, as potential prophylactic therapeutics against the development of PD. METHODS: The authors conducted a systematic review focusing on primary studies that test these compounds on cell and animal models to determine if they might have any neuroprotective or neuroplastic effects. RESULTS: The results of this review found that MTF may halt the progression of diseases such as PD through multiple mechanisms including reduced oxidative stress at the level of the mitochondria, thereby reducing α-synuclein related damage. Psilocybin, on the other hand, may increase repair of damaged neurons through psychoplastogenic activation of serotonergic pathways, particularly 5-HT2A receptor activation, ultimately increasing the release of brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and the reduction of α-synuclein accumulation. CONCLUSION: Implications of this study include a need for further research in off-label use of MTF as well as further research into serotonergic compounds such as psilocybin for the treatment and prevention of neurodegenerative diseases.",

Evaluating the impact of psilocybin on cognitive function is essential to unravel its potential benefits and risks. In this systematic review, we assessed psilocybin's effect on cognitive function through a comprehensive search of electronic databases from inception to January 2024, identifying 20 articles involving 2,959 participants. While 85% of studies were conducted in healthy volunteers, most of these studies (85%) used macrodoses, ranging from 45 μg/kg to 30 mg/70 kg. Various cognitive aspects were evaluated and yielded mixed results. Global cognitive function, and processing speed remained mostly unchanged in healthy individuals; However, a limited number of studies reported improvements in certain areas such as sustained attention, working memory, and executive function especially in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Emotional processing was positively modified, particularly in TRD patients. Psilocybin was observed to enhance emotional empathy without significantly altering cognitive empathy and social cognition. Cognitive flexibility and creative cognition were noted to initially decline but could potentially improve over time. Additionally, with respect to learning and memory skills, psilocybin showed promise in improving specific memory types such as semantic associations and associative learning, while its effects on episodic and verbal memory have been less pronounced compared to other cognitive enhancers. The observed mixed findings underscore the complexity of psilocybin's cognitive influence. Further research is essential to provide a clearer understanding of psilocybin's impact on cognitive domains and to guide the development of safe and effective interventions.",

Although psilocybin is proving to be effective in clinical trials for treatment of psychiatric disorders, the information processing mechanisms affected by psilocybin are not well understood. Here, we fit active inference and reinforcement learning computational models to a novel two-armed bandit reversal learning task capable of capturing engagement behaviour in rats. The model revealed that after receiving psilocybin, rats achieve more rewards through increased task engagement, mediated by modification of forgetting rates and reduced loss aversion. These findings suggest that psilocybin may afford an optimism bias that arises through altered belief updating, with translational potential for clinical populations characterised by lack of optimism.",

Primary outcome was change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating scale (MADRS) at 3 weeks posttreatment. Response was defined s ≥ 50 % reduction in MADRS, and remission as ≤10 MADRS score. Psychedelic experience was assessed using the Five-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness scale (5D-ASC). Safety measures included assessment of suicidality and adverse events. Participants on antidepressants were tapered to avoid drug interactions. RESULTS: Of 15 participants, 60 % met response and 53 % met remission criteria at Week 3. At 12 weeks, 47 % maintained response, and 40 % remission. Co-morbid PTSD did not significantly influence study outcomes. The psychedelic experience reported in 5D-ASC did not correlate with response. Participants judged to need antidepressants were restarted and considered non-responders from that timepoint (n = 4). No unexpected adverse events occurred. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include the small sample size, and the uncontrolled and unblinded nature of the study. CONCLUSIONS: In this first study on psilocybin for Veterans with severe TRD, a surprising response and remission was seen. Many Veterans had PTSD though no moderating impact of response was observed. The degree of psychedelic experience did not correlate with depression changes. Further study is warranted. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04433858.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks (SUNHA) are trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias that feature intense and recurrent paroxysms of pain and autonomic symptoms. Many patients are left with debilitating symptoms despite best-available treatment. Psychedelics, such as the serotonin 2A partial agonist psilocybin, have shown promise in related disorders such as migraine and cluster headache. In this open-label phase Ib ascending dose study, we aimed to assess the effects of low-dose oral psilocybin with psychological support in six to 12 patients with chronic SUNHA. Study objectives were to determine effects on cognition, as well as safety, tolerability, and effects on headache severity and frequency. METHODS: Oral psilocybin in ascending doses of 5, 7.5, and 10 mg (one dose per session; three dosing sessions in total) were administered. Cognition was assessed via the Cambridge Neuropsychological Tests Automated Battery. Headache attacks were assessed via headache diaries and the six-item Headache Impact Test (HIT-6). Subjective dose intensity was assessed via the five-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire (5D-ASC). The study was terminated early due to recruitment difficulties; four patients were enrolled, three of whom were study completers. Post hoc, we undertook a thematic analysis of the applicable free-text clinical trial notes from the dosing and subsequent visits (n = 22). An inductive method was employed to establish emergent themes. RESULTS: No significant adverse events were recorded. We were unable to collect data as planned on cognitive function during the acute experience due to high ratings of subjective dose intensity (mean 5D-ASC scores 37.8-45.7). The impact of the headaches remained severe throughout the duration of the trial (HIT-6 mean scores 64.3-65.7). There were limited effects on headache duration and severity based on the diaries; however, mean daily attack frequency decreased by >50% in two participants at final follow-up (22.9 to 11.0 and 56.4 to 28.0, respectively). Completing participants and their clinicians recorded \"much\" (two participants) or \"minimal\" improvements (one participant) at final follow-up via the Clinical Global Impression rating scale. Thematic analysis indicated that psychological insights were key features of participants' experience; these insights included re-configured relationships to their headache pain. CONCLUSION: The study met with recruitment difficulties and cognition could not be assessed during the acute experience due to subjective dose intensity, likely mediated in part by expectancy effects. The clinical results provide no conclusive evidence for the use of psilocybin in SUNHA. We suggest that accounting for psychological factors in chronic SUNHA may be an important facet of treatment.",

Patients with brain cancer have been excluded from studies, yet they stand to benefit as much as other patients with cancer-related psychological distress. Case description: In this report, we discuss the case of a patient with end-of-life distress secondary to stage 4 astrocytoma that received PAT through Health Canada's Special Access Program. The patient had a positive response to PAT without adverse events. Discussion: Standard treatment for existential distress is often inefficacious and PAT is rarely available, especially for patients with brain cancer. We highlight the importance of making PAT more available as many patients with unresolved existential distress resort to medical assistance in dying without ever knowing of the existence of PAT. Conclusion: PAT was effective in partially alleviating the patient's existential distress. Access to PAT needs to be expanded urgently.",

      "abstract": "Psilocybin, a major indole alkaloid found in magic mushrooms (Psilocybe cubensis), has recently drawn attention as a breakthrough therapy to treat major depressive disorder. This review aimed to summarize and identify knowledge gaps concerning their pharmacokinetic characteristics of psilocybin and its active metabolite, psilocin. Original studies related to pharmacokinetics of psilocybin conducted in vitro, animals, and humans were systematically collected from PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect, from their inceptions to November 2023. Twenty articles were included in this work and assessed for study quality. A comprehensive review of the pharmacokinetics of psilocybin and psilocin in both animals and humans was performed. Psilocybin is considered a prodrug that is dephosphorylated to psilocin by alkaline phosphatase. Following ingestion, the peak psilocin plasma and brain levels were rapidly achieved in a dose-dependent manner. Psilocin is metabolized primarily through both Phase I and Phase II processes with the half-life of 2-3 hours. This review also identified lack of some pharmacokinetic related information and limitations of available research that may help direct future investigations to better understand the pharmacokinetics and improve study design including dose selection and dosage optimization."

      "abstract": "There are currently no pharmacological treatments for cocaine use disorder. Recently there has been a great deal of interest in the potential of psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin to treat psychiatric disorders. Human studies have indicated that a single administration of psilocybin can have long-lasting effects. Few preclinical studies have examined a role for psilocybin in addiction models. The goal of the current study was to determine whether psilocybin would enhance extinction following cocaine self-administration in male and female mice and rats and thus result in an attenuation of cue-induced drug-seeking. In experiments in mice, 16 female and 19 male mice underwent 8d of cocaine self-administration (0.5 mg/kg/infusion) and extinction training. Immediately following extinction trials, mice were injected with vehicle or 1.0 mg/kg psilocybin. Following the conclusion of extinction training, mice were tested for cue-induced reinstatement. In experiments in rats, 24 female and 23 male rats underwent 15d of cocaine self-administration (0.8 mg/kg/infusion) and extinction training. Immediately following extinction trials, rats were injected with vehicle, 1.0 mg/kg psilocybin, or 2.5 mg/kg psilocybin. Following the conclusion of extinction training, rats were tested for cue-induced reinstatement. Psilocybin administered following extinction trials had no effect, as both female and male mice and rats demonstrated significant cue-induced reinstatement. These data suggest that psilocybin is ineffective at altering cocaine-seeking behavior in the paradigm and doses used in the current study. It remains to be seen whether treatment with psilocybin under different conditions may be useful in the long-standing goal of finding pharmacotherapies to treat CUD.",

      "abstract": "Current pharmacological treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD) are often only partially effective, with many patients experiencing no significant benefit, leading to treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Psilocybin, a classical serotonergic psychedelic, has emerged as a notable emerging treatment for such disorders. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to summarize and discuss the most recent evidence about the therapeutic effects of single-dose and two-dose psilocybin administration on the severity of depressive symptoms, as well as compare the efficacy of these interventions among patients with a primary diagnosis of MDD or TRD. Articles were collected from EBSCOhost and PubMed following the PRISMA guidelines, yielding 425 articles with 138 duplicates. After screening 287 records, 12 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. A quantitative analysis of the studies indicates that psilocybin is highly effective in reducing depressive symptoms severity among patients with primary MDD or TRD. Both single-dose and two-dose psilocybin treatments significantly reduced depressive symptoms severity, with two-dose administration sometimes yielding more pronounced and lasting effects. However, it is unclear if this was solely due to dosage or other factors. Future research should include standardized trials comparing these dosing strategies to better inform clinical practice."

However, diverse psychological support or psychotherapy was performed with psilocybin treatment. This study aimed to explore the association of psychological protocols with the efficacy of psilocybin-assisted therapy for depressive symptoms. METHOD: Five major databases were systemic searched for clinical trials addressing psilocybin-assisted therapy for patients with clinical depressive symptoms. A Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression were performed. The effect size was mean difference (with 95% credible interval) measured by 17-Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. RESULTS: There were 10 eligible studies including 515 adult patients with clinically diagnosed depression. The psychological protocols could be categorized into four types: (i) manualized directive psychotherapy(k=1); (ii) manualized nondirective psychological support(k=3), (iii) non-manualized nondirective psychological support(k=5); and (iv) non-manualized supportive psychotherapy(k=1). The pooled standard mean difference of psilocybin-assisted therapy was 10.08 (5.03-14.70). CONCLUSION: Compared with manualized nondirective psychological support, the other three psychological approaches did not differ significantly. The improvement of depressive symptoms was not associated with the psychological protocols in adult patients receiving psilocybin-assisted therapy.
