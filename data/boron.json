      "abstract": "Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is an emerging modality for cancer treatment. Although its concept was proposed in the last century, progress has been relatively slow due to limitations in neutron source technology and boron compounds. In recent years, with the increased availability of neutron devices and improvements in boron compounds, the radiobiological effects of BNCT have been investigated more deeply, leading to a surge of research findings in the field. Therefore, a systematic review of the current status of BNCT is particularly warranted. In this review, we integrate the latest studies to provide a comprehensive and detailed description of the direct and indirect mechanisms by which BNCT induces cell killing, as well as the subsequent cellular responses. More importantly, we propose that BNCT exhibits a stronger immunological foundation and immunogenicity compared to traditional radiotherapy, indicating significant potential for its combined application with immunotherapy. These results offer a robust theoretical foundation for the future clinical use of BNCT and indicate that continued investigation of BNCT in conjunction with immunotherapy may pave the way for more advanced cancer treatment strategies."

      "abstract": "The development of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) agents and structurally similar radiolabeled counterparts for diagnostic imaging is an area of significant interest. In this study, we designed structurally same compounds, c(RGD-BPA-K)(PEG2-(4-iodophenylbutyl)) (compound 1) and its radioiodinated counterpart, c(RGD-BPA-K)(PEG2-(4-[125I]iodophenylbutyl)) ([125I]1), for efficient BNCT and SPECT/CT imaging, respectively. An albumin-binding moiety was introduced into the compound to enhance the blood circulation time and tumor accumulation. We evaluated the efficacy of compound 1 and [125I]1 in U87MG tumor-bearing mice using SPECT/CT imaging, biodistribution analysis, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Both compound 1 and [125I]1 displayed similar pharmacokinetics, high blood retention, and substantial accumulation in U87MG tumors. This study highlights the potential of compound 1 and [125I]1 for SPECT/CT-guided BNCT. The structural identity between the therapeutic and diagnostic agents in BNCT can enhance its therapeutic efficacy. Further structural modifications to increase boron concentration in tumors, as well as thermal neutron irradiation studies, may be necessary to fully explore the potential of our novel BNCT agent."

      "abstract": "The current clinical application of the boron drug boronophenylalanine (BPA) in BNCT faces various issues owing to its low boron loading (approximately 5%), which limits its therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, the development of boron drugs with higher boron contents is essential. Enhancing the boron content in boron drug materials is the focus of this study. Two-dimensional (2D) boron nitride-doped nano graphene (BNNG) with a high boron content of 24.97% ± 1.14% w/w was synthesized via the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The size of BNNG was controlled through gradient density centrifugation. Subsequently, a strategy was proposed that leveraged a boron-nitrogen co-doping process to enhance the boron content. The resulting BN nanosheets that were grown on graphene oxide (GO) exhibited an onion-like structure. To serve as a multifunctional delivery platform, 10B-enriched BNNG was dispersed in an aqueous solution through π-π interactions with pyrene methanol polyethylene glycol carboxylate (PPEG) to form BNNG@PPEG, thus becoming water-dispersible. The synthesized multifunctional BNNG@PPEG material satisfied the requirements for BNCT, chemotherapy, and PTT with a high photothermal conversion efficiency (η = 40.552%). Under 1 W cm-2 laser irradiation, BNNG@PPEG generated a temperature of 55 °C, and the cell survival rate significantly decreased to 36.2% ± 3.5%. Meanwhile, the thermal property of BNNG-DOX@PPEG facilitated the controlled release of doxorubicin (DOX). Under neutron irradiation, the BNNG@PPEG complex exhibited significant antitumor activity, and the cell survival rate significantly decreased to 34.82% ± 6.1%."

We report using of the cadmium telluride double-sided strip detector (CdTe-DSD), distinguished by its high-energy resolution in full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 7.3 keV at 511 keV and a spatial resolution of 250μm for accurate boron imaging. Employing the CdTe-DSD with a pinhole collimator, our experiment at Japan Research Reactor No. 3 (JRR-3) evaluated the 10B distribution in a solid sample containing a 10B concentration of 0.3 mg during neutron exposure. Although measuring the 10B signal is significantly affected by the background from the γ-rays of 113Cd, we successfully obtained a circular projection image with a diameter of 11.5 mm, revealing the precise location of 10B, with a counting rate of 0.115 cps and SNR of approximately 25.7%. The results reveal the CdTe-DSD's capability to enhance BNCT by providing detailed insights into the 10B distribution within the sample with high fidelity."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIM: Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a novel treatment that induces targeted tumor cell damage through the selective accumulation of 10B compounds in cancer cells followed by the production of alpha and lithium particles using thermal neutron irradiation. Despite its potential, clinical applications of BNCT for recurrent gastrointestinal cancers remain limited. This study presents the first pilot clinical evaluation of BNCT using intravenous boronophenylalanine (10BPA) for such cancers. CASE REPORTS: Four patients with recurrent gastrointestinal cancers were enrolled in this phase I-II clinical study. All had tumors refractory to standard treatments, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. BNCT was performed using thermal neutron irradiation at Kyoto University Research Reactor. 10BPA was administered intravenously at 400 mg/kg, and no severe adverse effects were observed. Tumor responses varied, with one patient achieving partial response and three demonstrating stable disease at three months post-treatment. Notably, BNCT alleviated cancer-related symptoms, such as pain and nerve compression, improving patients' quality of life. Dosimetric evaluations confirmed effective tumor doses with acceptable exposure to surrounding normal tissues. CONCLUSION: BNCT is a promising modality for recurrent gastrointestinal cancers, offering symptom relief and potential antitumor effects. Its safety and feasibility were demonstrated in this study. Future research should explore fractionated BNCT and combination therapies with immunotherapy or targeted agents to enhance efficacy further.",

A significant challenge in BNCT lies in the development of efficient boron delivery systems that ensure adequate boron accumulation within tumor cells. This study aims to synthesize, characterize, and evaluate COSAN-functionalized nanoparticles (NP@I-COSAN) as a potential boron carrier for BNCT. Methods: Hybrid nanoparticles were synthesized by conjugating monoiodinated cobaltabisdicarbollides (I-COSAN) to commercially available acrylic polymer-based nanoparticles. Functionalization and cellular uptake were confirmed through FTIR, TGA, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and TEM/EDX analyses. Biocompatibility was evaluated by assessing cytotoxicity in HeLa cells and C. elegans as an in vivo model. Intracellular boron uptake was quantified using ICP-MS, with results compared to those obtained with 4-borono-L-phenylalanine conjugated to fructose (f-BPA). An in vitro BNCT proof-of-concept assay was also performed to evaluate therapeutic efficacy. Results: NP@I-COSAN demonstrated low cytotoxicity and efficient internalization in cells. ICP-MS analysis revealed stable boron retention, comparable to traditional boron agents. The BNCT assay further showed that NP@I-COSAN was effective in inducing tumor cell apoptosis, even at lower boron concentrations than conventional treatments. Conclusions: These results underscore the potential of NP@I-COSAN as an effective boron delivery system for BNCT, offering a promising strategy to enhance boron accumulation within tumor cells and improve treatment efficacy."

      "abstract": "Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) has emerged as a promising treatment for cancer, utilizing the interaction between thermal neutrons and boron-10 to selectively target and destroy cancer cells. This study evaluates the efficacy of BNCT using 4-borono-L-phenylalanine (BPA) in two different systems: reactor-based BNCT at Kyoto University Reactor (KUR) and accelerator-based BNCT at the Aomori Prefectural Quantum Science Center (QSC). The QSC cyclotron accelerator (HM-20V; Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Japan) operates a lower neutron generation capacity compared to the cyclotron accelerators (HM-30; Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Japan) used in clinical settings at Kansai BNCT Clinical Center in Osaka Medical Pharmaceutical University and Southern Tohoku Hospital. Using U87MG glioblastoma-bearing mouse models, we compared the therapeutic outcomes of both systems. This result may be partially attributed to the higher gamma-ray dose delivered by the QSC accelerator compared to KUR, which may enhance cytotoxic effects and help compensate for the lower neutron dose. Additionally, possible differences in overall neutron spectra delivered by the two different sources (KUR and QSC) used in the work described here could also have contributed to the observed outcomes."

      "abstract": "The origin of the meta- and ortho-to-fluorine site-selectivity in the C(sp2)-H borylation of fluorinated arenes with B2Pin2 and HBPin promoted by pyridine(dicarbene)cobalt catalysts has been investigated. In situ generation of the cobalt(I)-boryl complex and treatment with three representative fluoroarenes established meta-selective C(sp2)-H oxidative addition to form predominantly the meta isomers of the corresponding cobalt(I)-aryl complexes. Attempts to observe or isolate the four-coordinate cobalt(I)-boryl complex yielded the cobalt-hydride dimer, [(iPrACNC)CoH]2, borohydride (iPrACNC)CoH2BPin, or diboryl hydride, (iPrACNC)CoH(BPin)2 depending on the amounts of B2Pin2 and HBPin present. The phosphite derivatives (iPrACNC)CoH(P(OiPr)3) and (iPrACNC)CoBPin(P(OiPr)3) were prepared and crystallographically characterized. In the catalytic borylation of 1,3-difluorobenzene, ortho-to-fluorine cobalt(I)-aryl and borohydride complexes were identified as resting states despite meta-to-fluorine borylation being the major product of catalysis. Deuterium kinetic isotope effects support irreversible but not turnover-limiting C(sp2)-H oxidative addition. Stoichiometric borylation of isolated cobalt(I)-aryl intermediates with B2Pin2 established that the meta-cobalt(I)-aryl was more reactive than the ortho-isomer and accounts for the observed cobalt(I)-aryl resting states. All cobalt(I)-aryl compounds reacted more quickly with HBPin. While ortho-cobalt(I)-aryl compounds yielded arylboronate products with high site-selectivity, meta-cobalt-aryl counterparts yielded a mixture of arylboronate isomers and free arene. Deuterium labeling experiments with DBPin confirmed that HBPin mediates reversible C(sp2)-H oxidative addition. Thus, the overall site-selectivity arises from two reinforcing effects: (i) kinetically meta-selective oxidative addition and (ii) faster reaction of the meta-cobalt-aryl isomer with B2Pin2. As B2Pin2 is converted to HBPin, C(sp2)-H reductive elimination competes against borylation of the meta-cobalt-aryl isomer, resulting in increased ortho-selective borylation."

Fourteen patients were enrolled: six with breast cancer, five with lung cancer, and three with esophageal cancer. Although BNCT is performed with a single fraction from a single beam direction, two-fraction treatments with different beam angles were considered to improve the dose of gross tumor volume (GTV) in cases where the dose constraint of GTV was not achieved. Relative biological effectiveness (RBE)-weighted dose distributions were calculated based on computed tomography (CT) images via Monte Carlo simulation (PHITS) to evaluate the dose to GTV and organs-at-risk (OARs). One-field irradiation plans in six patients (breast: 1, lung: 4, esophageal: 1) did not achieve the dose constraint of GTV owing to deep-seated or large tumors, whereas those in the other patients did. Among these six patients, the two-field irradiation plan improved the achievement rate of the dose constraint of GTV from zero to five patients and that of heart from five to six patients. Moreover, the 2-field irradiation plan improved the homogeneity index of GTV. Changing the appropriate dose prescription and number of treatment fractions according to the patient's condition can enhance the safe delivery of BNCT for thoracic cancers while delivering a sufficient dose to the tumors.",

      "abstract": "Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is an attractive therapeutic approach for treating refractory cancers. Currently, 4-borono-L-phenylalanine (BPA) is the only boron carrier approved for BNCT, specifically for unresectable, locally advanced, or recurrent head and neck cancers in Japan. However, efficacy of BPA relies on the L-type amino acid transporter (LAT1), which is highly expressed in many cancers, limiting its broader application. In this study, we investigated the potential of a novel boron carrier, pteroyl-closo-dodecaborate-conjugated 4-(p-iodophenyl)butyric acid (PBC-IP), designed to the folate receptors (FRs), as an alternative for BNCT in head and neck cancers. PBC-IP was injected into human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma SAS xenograft mice to assess its biodistribution and therapeutic efficacy compared to BPA. Our results showed that PBC-IP achieved selective tumor accumulation, although the boron concentration in tumors was lower than that of BPA (5 μg [10B]/g vs. 15 μg [10B]/g, respectively). PBC-IP underwent significant hepatic metabolism. BNCT treatment with PBC-IP suppressed tumor growth in mice, whereas BPA showed superior efficacy, nearly eliminating tumors. Importantly, no significant toxicity was observed in either group. These findings suggest that while PBC-IP exhibits some potential for BNCT targeting FR-expressing tumors, BPA remains the more effective option for head and neck cancer.",

Advanced technology, such as electrochemical biosensors, have emerged as powerful tools as sensitive, selective and cost-efficient tools to identify biomarkers.

This review provides a comprehensive analysis of BDD electrodes, including synthesis, material properties and surface modification techniques aimed at enhancing electrochemical performance. Furthermore, the review discusses the use of BDD-based biosensors in the early detection of major diseases such as cancer, metabolic disorders and infection. By incorporating recent advancements, this article highlights the significant potential of BDD-based electrochemical biosensors in modern medical diagnostics and provides a foundation for future research."

      "abstract": "In this study, we investigated the possible effects of cobalt and boron nanoparticles as an inducer of the first stages of development (germination) of hard and soft wheat when simulating flooding as one of the limiting environmental factors. We also investigated the remote effect of treating wheat grains with nanoparticles when flooding was applied already at the tillering stage. To identify the effects of nanoparticles, we used morphometric, biochemical and phenotypic parameters of seedlings and plants of two wheat species differing in origin and the response of these parameters to flooding. Positive effects were found at the germination stage, increasing quantitative indicators under stress. The sensitivity of wheat species to flooding was different, which corresponds to historical and climatic aspects of cultivation. Sensitivity to stress effects associated with loss of germination, decreased growth and photosynthesis was shown for both species. Treatment with cobalt and boron nanoparticles enhanced adaptation to stress and improved photosynthetic parameters, but the encouraging results under stressful conditions were ambiguous and in the case of soft wheat could lead to deterioration of some parameters. Thus, the use of boron and cobalt nanoparticles has potential for reducing productivity under stress, but requires a detailed assessment of the cultivation protocol depending on the genotype."

However, the limited tumor-targeting capability of these dyes hinders their effectiveness in oncological imaging. Currently, various ligand-based targeting probes have been developed to minimize nonspecific background emission. BRAF, especially BRAF V600E, is a common cancer gene and undergoes frequent mutation in melanoma. Small molecular BRAF kinase inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of melanoma patients carrying the BRAF V600E mutation, including Vemurafenib, Dabrafenib and so on. Boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) as an important fluorescent class has been investigated extensively. Vemurafenib-BODIPY has been reported to visualize BRAF V600E mutated cancer cells. Herein, the designed BODIPY-based Vemurafenib derivatives targeting BRAF for cancer cell imaging are reported. The fluorescent probes are characterized and evaluated of photophysical properties, targeted binding and live cell imaging. Compound 1a exhibited promising fluorescence imaging ability. To improve fluorescence quantum yield, structural optimization is performed by incorporating meso N,N'-dialkyl-substituted amides to BODIPY core. Compound 1d shows excellent fluorescence properties and nice binding affinity. It allows visualization of BRAF V600E mutated cancer cells at low concentrations."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Boron, a trace element, is involved in various physiological and metabolic processes, and recent studies suggest that boron compounds may have potential in cancer prevention and treatment. In this study, the antiangiogenic effects of a boron compound, borax pentahydrate (BPH), were investigated. Angiogenesis is a tightly regulated biological process responsible for the formation of new blood vessels from existing vasculatures. This process plays a critical role in cancer progression, making it an important target for cancer therapy. Pancreatic and kidney cancers are difficult to treat because they are aggressive and resistant to chemotherapy. METHODS: The antiproliferative activity was evaluated using the MTT assay, while antiangiogenic effects were tested through in vitro tube formation assays and in ovo chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. The effect of BPH on VEGF levels was determined using Western blot analysis in HUVEC, ACHN, PANC-1 cells. The effect of BPH on tumor angiogenesis was investigated with an in vivo Ehrlich ascites carcinoma model (EAC). RESULTS: BPH exhibited potent antiproliferative and antiangiogenic activities, inhibiting the proliferation of ACHN, PANC-1, and HUVECs, disrupting endothelial tube formation, and inhibiting vascular formation on the CAM surface in a dose-dependent manner. VEGF levels were significantly decreased in ACHN, PANC-1 and HUVECs. There was also a decrease in VEGF and TGF-β1 levels in BPH-treated tumor groups. In addition, BPH caused a decrease in tumor size. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that BPH may be a new antiangiogenic and antitumoral agent. BPH may contribute to drug development studies targeting angiogenesis-related diseases as a promising new therapeutic agent."

Polymeric materials incorporating BCCs exhibit significant chemical and thermal stability, making them valuable for applications in biomedical fields, energy storage, ultrahigh stability materials, and π-conjugated luminochromic polymers. This review article aims to explore the primary methods for integrating these distinctive clusters into traditional carbon-based polymers. Both boron and carbon atoms possess catenation abilities, enabling the formation of extensive macromolecular structures. While carbon forms long linear chains, boron typically leads to three-dimensional polyhedral clusters. We first examine hybrid nanostructures, focusing on weak non-covalent interactions such as dihydrogen bonding, hydrophobic, and chaotropic effects between boron clusters and polymer chains. We then discuss classical chemical bonding approaches. Despite their inorganic nature, boron clusters can undergo exoskeletal substitution akin to organic counterparts, allowing their attachment as side groups to polymer repeating units. Additionally, polyhedral boron clusters can be incorporated into polymer backbones primarily through polycondensation reactions, resulting in hybrid macromolecules with exceptional physical and chemical attributes. Finally, we summarize the applications of BCC-containing polymeric materials, including their use in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT), solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) for metal ion batteries, and as electron acceptor groups in stimuli-responsive luminescent materials. In summary, BCC-containing polymeric materials are increasingly considered viable alternatives to traditional hydrocarbon-based polymers for biomedical applications, ion-conducting materials, luminescent materials, and temperature-resistant materials."

In this study, boron carbide (B4C) nanoparticles were subjected to chemical modification, with the folic acid moiety linked to the surface of the particles by varying the segments of the covalent linker polyethylene glycol (PEG) through γ-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) functionalization. The resultant products were three boron agents, termed as B4C-APTES-FA, B4C-APTES-PEG2K-FA, and B4C-APTES-PEG5K-FA. A comparison was made between these products and the pristine B4C nanoparticles by investigating their physicochemical properties and biological performances, including hemolysis, cytotoxicity, and cellular uptake. Subsequently, the modified B4C-APTES-PEG2K-FA nanoparticles were subjected to in vivo safety assays and biodistribution investigations in mice at various dosages. Upon characterization using ICP-OES, it was found that the boron contents were the highest in the lungs, followed by the liver, spleen, kidneys, hearts, and tumors, and the lowest in the brain and muscles. The boron content in the tumor reached as high as 50 μg per g of dried tissue weight after 24 h of intravenous injection (I.V.), while the tumor-to-muscle and tumor-to-brain ratios of boron contents were found to exceed 3 following 24 hours of intravenous injection. These findings suggest that B4C nanoparticles are promising for BNCT owing to their high boron content, satisfactory biocompatibility, and abundant chemical modification sites."

The animals were divided into five groups: control, B, low-dose B + AA, and high-dose B + AA. After the 15 th day of the experiment, their blood and bone marrow were harvested to be kept for hematological analyses. While white blood cells (WBC) increased following the administration of AA, bodyweight, red blood cells, platelets, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and bone marrow nucleated cell counts significantly decreased in number. Conversely, bodyweight and all these hematological parameters significantly increased apart from WBC in the B + AA groups AA when compared to the control. However, high-dose B was more effective than low-dose B in preventing AA-induced bone marrow and hematological damage. The present study suggests that B treatment could help protect bone marrow and hematological parameters against AA-induced toxicity."

Herein, we report the design and fabrication of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) based dual Z-Scheme heterojunction for effective photocatalytic degradation of various refractory pollutants in wastewater. Firstly, we synthesized boron-doped g-C3N4 via the direct calcination of melamine along with boric acid, and then coupled with Copper Oxide (CuO) and MXene via the wet-chemical method to fabricate dual Z-scheme CuO/BCN/MXene composite. The physicochemical features of the as-prepared CuO/BCN/MXene composite and reference samples were investigated via various characterization techniques. The photocatalytic degradation performance and the kinetics study for malachite green was evaluated using the as-fabricated dual Z-scheme composite and the coupling components. The CuO/BCN/MXene composite revealed exceptional photocatalytic performance by achieving 98.3 % degradation for malachite green, which is remarkably higher than the reference samples. The enhanced performance was attributed to the band gap narrowing, extended light absorption, and improved charge carrier separation. This study will provide new insights into the design and fabrication of functional nanomaterials for efficient photocatalytic degradation of pollutants and other applications."

In this study, soybean seedlings were irrigated with nutrient solution containing either 0 or 100 mM NaCl with two B levels. The results showed that salt stress adversely inhibited plant growth-related parameters and photosynthetic rate, caused oxidative damage in terms of higher malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Co-treatment with B and salt causes a decrease in overall Na+ content in plant, with increased in Na+ content in root and root cell wall (CW) and a reduction in Na+ translocation factor. Additionally, B supplementation boosted antioxidant enzyme activities, and reduced MDA, H2O2, and osmotic substance levels under salt stress. Boron specifically induced the phenylpropanoid metabolism pathway, enhanced the antioxidants accumulation such as cinnamic acid, coumarin, and sinapic acid, as well as flavonoids like glycine and genistein, collectively reduced salt-induced ROS accumulation. Taken together, B mitigates salt stress by enhancing root antioxidant defenses and activating the phenylpropanoid metabolism pathway which reduces ROS level. Boron enhanced root retention of Na+ to alleviate oxidative damage caused by Na+ accumulation in leaf, ultimately improves photosynthesis and promotes seedlings growth."

This study investigates the potential of iron-doped boron nitride nanoparticles (Fe-BNNPs) as a nanocarrier for Anastrozole, a key aromatase inhibitor used in breast cancer therapy. Using density functional theory (DFT), we systematically analyzed the interaction mechanisms between Anastrozole and Fe-BNNPs, focusing on binding energies, electronic properties, and structural stability. Our results reveal a strong adsorption of Anastrozole on Fe-BNNPs, with binding energies ranging from - 0.6 to - 1.4 eV, indicating a stable and efficient drug-carrier interaction. Iron doping significantly enhances the reactivity of BNNPs, improving drug loading and release capabilities. Nanoparticles passivated with -H and -OH groups and functionalized with iron nanoclusters were examined, demonstrating that -H passivation yields more stable structures compared to -OH, despite minor variations in electronic properties such as energy gaps (e.g., 2.51 eV for -H vs. 2.54 eV for -OH). The incorporation of iron nanoclusters further increases the binding energy of Anastrozole by approximately 40%, highlighting its role in optimizing drug-nanocarrier interactions. Optical absorption spectra reveal distinct peaks for Anastrozole adsorption on -H and -OH passivated surfaces, providing a clear indicator of interaction states. These findings underscore the potential of Fe-BNNPs as a promising nanocarrier for targeted Anastrozole delivery, offering enhanced precision and therapeutic efficacy.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the pollutant sulfamethoxazole (SMX) that is widely used in medical therapy has been frequently detected in different water systems. Thereby, it is necessary to develop green and effective advanced oxidation strategies, especially the electro-oxidation process. In this study, an electro-oxidation system featuring a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode and NaCl as the supporting electrolyte was implemented to effectively remove sulfamethoxazole (SMX) without the addition of external oxidants. The operational parameters were optimized using the response surface methodology with a pH 7.5, current density of 4.44 mA/cm2, and NaCl concentration of 20 mmol/L. The optimization significantly enhanced the degradation efficiency of SMX to obtain 100% removal in 5 min. Results of scavenging and chemical probe experiments indicated the presence of hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and chlorine radicals (Cl•), with the latter primarily forming between the reaction of Cl- and •OH. A competition experiment further revealed the relative oxidative contribution of Cl• of 38.6%, highlighting its significant role in the degradation process. Additionally, ion chromatography analysis confirmed the presence of Cl• without the formation of harmful by-products such as ClO4-, affirming the environmentally friendly nature of the system. The toxicity of the degradation by-products was also assessed. The application of current was investigated to explore the influence of coexistence ions as well as repeatability. Overall, this work highlighted the effectiveness of the electro-oxidation system for the degradation of organic pollutants in saline wastewater, demonstrating the significance of optimization of operational parameters for efficient and sustainable environmental remediation."

      "abstract": "As a typical heavy metal pollutant discharged from industrial activities, nickel ions are highly bioaccumulative and carcinogenic, and low concentrations (>0.5 mg/L) can disrupt the balance of aquatic ecosystems and pose a threat to human health. In this study, a bifunctional adsorbent based on a carboxymethyl cellulose/boron nitride hydrogel was prepared for the treatment of nickel-containing wastewater with a high adsorption capacity of Ni2+ (800 mg/L, 344 mg/g), and after adsorption, the waste gel was converted into nickel-doped porous carbon material through carbonization and used as a bilayer capacitor electrode to achieve a specific capacitance of 40.6 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. The capacity retention rate was >98% after 150 cycles. This strategy simultaneously solves the problems of nickel-containing wastewater purification (the adsorption method is applicable to medium- and high-concentration heavy-metal wastewater) and environmental pollution caused by waste adsorbents, and provides a new paradigm of the \"adsorption-resourcing\" closed-loop treatment of heavy-metal pollutants."

      "abstract": "Boron neutron capture therapy leverages the nuclear reaction between boron-10 and thermal neutrons to selectively destroy cancer cells while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissues. This therapy finds use in treating glioblastoma, which, as a brain cancer, is difficult to treat using conventional radiotherapy, surgery, and chemotherapy due to location and the risk of brain damage. However, to work, the cells must contain 10B. 4-Borono-l-phenylalanine (l-BPA) is the most frequently used boron delivery agent in this therapy. Surprisingly, despite its seemingly simple structure, there is no consensus approach to making it-the synthesis of l-BPA has been approached through multiple routes, reflecting the challenges in producing high-purity, isotopically enriched material. When a new site is looking to make this essential material, it can be challenging to determine the best route for the situation as there is no critical analysis comparing and discussing the relative merits of the approaches. Herein, the reported methods, from both the academic and patent literature, used to synthesize l-BPA, are comprehensively and critically examined and compared. The review also highlights the limitations of each method regarding scalability, cost-effectiveness, and safety, especially considering the high cost of isotopically enriched 10B."

      "abstract": "Lung cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer globally, with 2.5 million new cases representing 12.4 % of the total number of new cases. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are two main subtypes of lung cancer that have different growth and dissemination capacities. Treatment options for lung cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy, including Bortezomib, an FDA-approved boron-derived agent. To bring novel boron-containing compounds to the armamentarium of lung cancer therapy, this study aimed to unravel the anti-cancer potential of Boric Acid (BA) and Sodium pentaborate pentahydrate (NaB) on Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer cell line A549. According to the results, the survival rates of A549 cells decreased after BA and NaB treatments by 5.5-fold and 5.2-fold, respectively. The number of colony-forming units was reduced by 3-fold and 2.4-fold after BA and NaB treatments, respectively. Gene expressions and protein levels of some pro-apoptotic and tumor suppressor genes were upregulated and some anti-apoptotic genes were downregulated. Cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase was detected after treatment with both boron. Proliferation markers Ki-67 and PCNA, and checkpoint regulators CDK1 and CDK2 gene expression levels were downregulated after BA and NaB treatments in the A549 cells. Our findings point to a promising selective anti-cancer activity of BA and NaB in the A549 cells without exerting any adverse effects on normal cells. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are required to get detailed information about the anti-cancer mechanism of BA, and NaB on lung cancer.",

Herein, we employed a dendrimer engineering strategy to develop the boron difluoride formazanate (BDF) dye BDF-8OMe for photoacoustic imaging-mediated NIR-II photothermal therapy. BDF-8OMe, characterized by an increased molecular branching degree and extended π-conjugation, exhibited broad absorbance peaked at 905 nm, with the absorption tail extending to 1300 nm. Additionally, reorganization energy calculation, molecular dynamics simulation, and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that the multiple identical dendritic units of BDF-8OMe significantly enhanced the molecular motions, enabling the nanoparticles (NPs) to rapidly release 94.4% of the excited state energy through nonradiative decay at a rate of 11.7 ps. Under 1064 nm photoirradiation, BDF-8OMe NPs achieved a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 62.5%, facilitating NIR-II photothermal theranostics.

      "abstract": "Tiopronin is a thiol-based medication recognized for its antioxidant properties, which may offer therapeutic benefits for various medical conditions. At present, it is utilized for the treatment of cystinuria and rheumatoid arthritis. However, its limited bioavailability poses a significant challenge for broader applications, necessitating high systemic doses to achieve localized therapeutic effects. The incorporation of a drug delivery system could help overcome this issue by allowing for controlled and targeted release. Functionalized B12N12 fullerenes present a promising platform with substantial potential for biomedical applications, particularly in drug delivery. In this study, the effect of loading the tiopronin drug on the structural and electronic properties of pure B12N12, AlB11N12 and GaB11N12 fullerenes nano agent were evaluated using density functional theory in both gas and aqueous environments. The adsorption energy of tiopronin over the fullerenes has been studied through its nucleophilic sites (COOH, NH2, CO, and SH). Based on our analysis, the adsorption energies are about -1.69, -3.38 and -1.96 eV for the most stable complexes of B12N12, AlB11N12 and GaB11N12, respectively. Electronic analysis showed that the HOMO-LUMO gaps decrease upon drug adsorption, resulting in significant changes in molecular orbital levels and quantum molecular descriptors. Additionally, quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis, electron localization function (ELF), and reduced density gradient (RDG) plots were explored to investigate interaction properties.",

Boron neutron capture therapy-sensitive organelles within the range of α particles and 7Li recoil nuclei can enhance killing effects on tumor cells. However, comprehensive studies on the sensitive organelles to BNCT are currently lacking. In the present study, we explored the sensitivity of organelles in U251 MG glioblastomas to BNCT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Trypan blue exclusion assay, the level of autophagic proteins, cell counting kit-8, and clonogenic formation assay were used to evaluate the sensitivity of the cellular membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum, the mitochondria, and the cell nuclei of U251 MG glioblastomas to BNCT (10B atoms of L-4-boronophenylalanin capture neutrons). RESULTS: Boron neutron capture therapy induced a trypan blue exclusion rate of 93.33%, no changes in the levels of LC3-II and Beclin-1, a survival rate of 77.78%, and reproductive death of 90.25% in U251 MG glioblastomas. These results indicate a hierarchical sensitivity of U251 MG glioblastoma organelles to BNCT ranked as the cell membrane (the endoplasmic reticulum) < the mitochondria < and the cell nucleus. Reproductive death, the main type of U251 MG glioblastoma death induced by BNCT, is attributed to the shortening of the S phase duration. CONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive understanding of sensitive organelles within tumor cells to BNCT lays the foundation for significantly improving the efficacy of BNCT in killing tumor cells."

However, the rise of drug-resistant MAC necessitates the development of alternative therapeutics. Here, we present a late-stage boron-mediated aglycon delivery strategy for selective modification of AZM, generating a library of potential anti-MAC drugs designated KU01 to KU13. Screening of KU01 to KU13 revealed that KU13 exhibited enhanced antimicrobial activity against wild-type and macrolide-resistant MAC compared to AZM. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis indicated that the inserted tercyclic moiety of KU13 formed a robust anchor on the bacterial ribosome, creating a binding pocket with base flipping of U2847, potentially bypassing the standard mechanism of macrolide resistance. These results position KU13 as a promising lead for therapeutics against macrolide-resistant MAC.",

More importantly, BDP was capable of efficiently suppressing the development of bacterial biofilms and even eliminate established biofilms, thereby facilitating the enhancement of sterilizing efficacy.

Accelerator-based boron neutron capture therapy is a form of targeted radiotherapy that uses boron-10 to label tumor cells.

The newly developed treatment control system integrates real-time stereoscopic x-ray imaging technology, enabling dynamic adjustments to the treatment plan by continuously monitoring changes in tumors and surrounding tissues. To optimize treatment accuracy, the system employs an affine transformation algorithm, ensuring precise dose delivery and accurate patient positioning. Positioning test results demonstrate that the system excels in its core functionality of ensuring patient positioning accuracy, significantly improving treatment adaptability while minimizing damage to healthy tissues. In addition, the study introduces the accelerator-based boron neutron capture therapy device independently designed and constructed by Lanzhou University.

However, the precise engineering of catalytic sites to enhance targeted 1O2 production remains a formidable challenge. This study reports a B-doped graphitic carbon nitride-supported Cu single-atom catalyst (CuBCN) that significantly enhances H2O2 activation for efficient 1O2 production. Through comprehensive experimental and theoretical analysis, revealing that B doping modulates the electronic properties at the Cu active sites. This modification reduces the electron density around Cu, increasing the Cu(II) fraction essential for the formation and subsequent oxidation of ·OOH intermediates. Additionally, B influences the d-band center of Cu, optimizing the adsorption energy of ·OOH, which in turn facilitates selective 1O2 production. The CuBCN/H2O2 system exhibits exceptional Fenton-like performance, producing 1O2 as the principal active species, even in challenging water conditions characterized by high pH, high ionic strength, and high concentrations of humic substances. This work not only highlights the potential of tailored single-atom catalysts in pollution control but also offers significant insights for designing catalysts for efficient H2O2 activation."

For this purpose, three types of composite detectors based on the single crystalline films and single crystals of Y3Al5O12 and Lu3Al5O12 garnets, doped with Ce3+, Pr3+ and Sc3+ ions, were produced using the liquid phase epitaxy growth method. The scintillation reader for in-situ dose measurement of different radiation components at BNCT was constructed based on the developed types of composite detectors. The possibility of recording various radiation components was demonstrated using: 1) the differences in the pulse height spectra and scintillation decay kinetics of various parts of composite detectors under excitation by α-particles of 239Pu source; 2) the difference in the radioluminescence spectra of films and crystal scintillators in composite detectors under excitation by γ-rays of 192Ir (392 keV) source. The obtained results were discussed for choice of the best registration methods and types of composite detectors for direct dose measurements of secondary radiation under excitation with thermal neutrons."

      "abstract": "Cancer remains a major concern for human health worldwide. To fight the curse of cancer, boron neutron capture therapy is an incredibly advantageous modality in the treatment of cancer as compared to other radiotherapies. Due to tortuous vasculature in and around tumor regions, boron (10B) compounds preferentially house into tumor cells, creating a large dose gradient between the highly mingled cancer cells and normal cells. Epithermal or thermal neutron bombardment leads to tumor-cell-selective killing due to the generation of heavy particles yielded from in situ fission reaction. However, the major challenges for boron nanocomposites' development have been from the synthesis part as well as the requirement for selective cancer targeting and the delivery of therapeutic concentrations of boron (10B) with nominal healthy tissue accumulation and retention. To circumvent the above challenges, this review discusses boride nanocomposite design, safety, and biocompatibility for biomedical applications for general public use. This review sparks interest in using boron nanocomposites as boron neutron capture therapy agents and repurposing them in comorbidity treatments, with future scientific challenges and opportunities, with a hope to accelerate the stimulus of developing possible boron composite nanomedicine research and applications worldwide."

The size of its sensitive cavity is only 1 mm to cope with the high intensity of BNCT neutron fields. The new detector was tested in reference fields where the thermal neutron component is negligible (photons, protons and fast neutrons), showing the same response as another mini-TEPC with identical design but for the boron doping. First tests were then performed at the thermal neutron column of the research reactor of the Laboratory for Applied Nuclear Energy in Pavia, Italy, with both detectors. Measured microdosimetric spectra were consistent with previous data taken at other thermal neutron sources.

      "abstract": "Bangladesh, despite being a top raw jute producer, struggles with inadequate jute seed quantity and quality due to some unforeseen circumstances. Boron is a key micronutrient for enhancing crop seed yield and quality. However, research on its effects on jute (Corchorus olitorius) seed production in Bangladesh remains limited, highlighting a significant knowledge gap. Therefore, a two-year field study was conducted at the Bangladesh Jute Research Institute, Regional Station in Faridpur to examine the effects of various boron application methods and doses on Corchorus olitorius seed production. The experiment included ten treatments combining three boron doses (2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 kg/ha) with three different application methods: (1) full dose as basal application, (2) full dose as foliar spray in two equal split and (3) haft the dose as basal application with the remaining half as foliar spray in two equal splits. An additional treatment without boron served as the control. The experiment, using the jute variety BJRI Tossa Pat 8, was conducted in a randomized complete block design to account for environmental variability and enhance treatment comparison. The study revealed that, independent of application methods and doses, boron application significantly improved seed yield and germination percentage compared to treatments without boron. Foliar application of boron at 3.0 kg/ha significantly enhanced yield contributing characters, including the number of capsules/plant, capsule length, and 1000-seed weights, compared to control and basal treatments. Additionally, boron application consistently improved seed yield and germination percentage across all methods and doses. The 3.0 kg/ha foliar treatment, applied half at 20-25 days after sowing and the remainder at the first flowering stage, yielded the highest results for Corchorus olitorius. Principal component analysis indicated that the number of seeds per capsule, capsule length, and seed yield were the main contributors. So, 3.0 kg/ha foliar boron treatment, applied half at 20-25 days after sowing and the remainder at the first flowering stage is recommended for late jute seed production to achieve optimum seed yield and net profit."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Protons, which are considered low-LET (Linear Energy Transfer) radiation, have an average RBE (relative biological effectiveness) of 1.1, with a range from 0.7 to 1.6. Thus, increasing biological effectiveness is of high interest in radiation oncology, and one way to enhance this is by using radiosensitizers. The present work investigates the effectiveness of the proton boron fusion reaction (PBFR) at the cellular level, using the sodium salt of metallacarborane [3,3'-Co(C2B9H11)2]- (Na[o-COSAN]) as the boron source, aiming to explore the potential of this type of boron clusters as a radiosensitizer for proton therapy. Therefore, the main goal was to test the hypothesis that loading the cells with boron will favour the PBFR at energies close to the Bragg peak. This would enhance the radiation-induced biological effects through the production of alpha-particles. RESULTS: MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were used. Nuclear microscopy assessed [o-COSAN] uptake and distribution in single cells, while biodistribution was studied in tumor-bearing Balb/cSlc-nu/nu mice (MDA-MB-231 xenograft), with boron accumulation in target organs and tumor measured by ICP-OES. The cells were irradiated with a proton beam tuned to reach the PBFR resonance energy of 675 keV at the cell layer. DNA damage was assessed with the g-H2AX assay and cell survival with the clonogenic assay. Beam parameters and dose calibration curves using radiochromic films validated Monte Carlo dosimetry simulations. As expected, we observed higher biological damage in irradiated cells and the presence of [o-COSAN]- potentiated the damage. These results translate into a lower cellular viability, indicating that DNA damage imposed colonies smaller than their non-irradiated counterparts. This suggests that these damages either took longer time to be repaired or made the cells undergo less efficient survival mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: The radiosensitizing effect of [o-COSAN]- by strategic cellular 11B placement and proton irradiation intensifies the DNA damage, making the nucleus particularly susceptible and thus increasing the destructive capability of alpha-particles, generated in the nuclear fusion reaction, which may lead to increased cell mortality."

      "abstract": "Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) has recently attracted attention as a new cancer treatment option. In BNCT, boron compounds need to accumulate efficiently in tumor tissues to achieve excellent therapeutic effects. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop a technology that can selectively and efficiently deliver boron compounds to tumors. In this study, we developed a novel fluorophenyl boronic acid (FPBA)-modified polyrotaxane (FPBA-PRX) and evaluated its potential as a tumor-selective boron compound for BNCT. FPBA-PRX is taken up by tumor cells through the binding between the FPBA moiety of FPBA-PRX and sialic acid on tumor cells. Importantly, the cellular uptake of FPBA-PRX was markedly higher than that of FPBA-modified cellulose (FPBA-CEL) because the FPBA moiety in FPBA-PRX was movable along with the axial chain of PRX, thereby avoiding a spatial mismatch between FPBA and sialic acid in tumor cells. Moreover, the accumulation of FPBA-PRX in the tumors after intravenous administration in mice was higher than that of FPBA-CEL. Furthermore, in vivo antitumor activity of FPBA-PRX was stronger than that of FPBA alone or commercially available boron compounds. These findings indicate the potential of FPBA-PRX as a tumor-selective boron compound for BNCT.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the dosimetric impact of implementing heterogeneous boron distribution into dose evaluations on tumors in BNCT. The study involved 27 patients who underwent 18F-BPA PET/CT scans. Dose evaluations were performed using various methods reflecting boron concentrations on CT images. The conventional dose evaluations, which reflected uniform boron concentration in blood of 25 ppm and a constant tumor-to-blood (T/B) ratio of 3.5, were compared with individual dose evaluations, which reflected the blood boron concentration and T/B ratio calculated from 18F-BPA in each patient. The heterogeneous tumoral dose distribution was also compared, revealing the dosimetric impact of the boron distribution calculated from each voxel of 18F-BPA. The spatial correspondence between 18F-BPA and dose distribution was compared using metabolic tumor volume (MTV) from 18F-BPA and isodose volume from the heterogeneous dose distribution. Results showed that the median blood boron concentration and T/B ratio calculated from 18F-BPA were 25.57 (23.90-27.84) ppm and 3.75 (2.54-4.59), respectively, comparable to those in the conventional dose evaluations. All dose indices in the heterogeneous tumoral dose evaluations were significantly lower than those in the conventional dose evaluations (p < 0.01). However, the spatial correspondence between the 18F-BPA and the dose distribution was not observed in the dice similarity coefficients of both MTV40-40% isodose volume and MTV50-50% isodose volume. In conclusion, the study confirmed the validity of applying the boron concentration calculated from 18F-BPA to the dose evaluation for a patient in BNCT. The differences might be associated with non-inter-patient variations of 18F-BPA, but the conventional dose evaluations mainly focused on the high boron concentration area within the tumor. Furthermore, the discrepancies in the patients were also observed between the 18F-BPA distribution and the heterogeneous dose distribution. Therefore, this study suggested that the indications for BNCT should consider not only 18F-BPA but also the dose distributions, which could reflect the heterogeneous tumoral boron distribution.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) was conducted in a hospital using an accelerator-based neutron source. The neutron beam intensity at the patient position was evaluated offline using a gold-based neutron activation method. During BNCT neutron beam irradiation on patients, the neutron intensity was controlled in real time by measuring the proton beam current irradiated on a lithium neutron target. The neutron intensity at NCCH decreased owing to the degradation of the lithium neutron target during neutron irradiation. The reduction in the neutron beam intensity could not be monitored via proton beam measurement due to the dependence of neutron production on the neutron target condition. PURPOSE: The duration of BNCT neutron irradiation should be controlled by monitoring the neutron beam intensity with a real-time neutron detector for reliable neutron irradiation on patients. The measurement accuracy of the online neutron beam monitor was experimentally obtained by comparing the gold radioactivity measured at the patient position. Radiation-induced damage was observed from the variation in the pulse height distributions of multichannel analyzer during long-term neutron exposure. METHODS: Neutron beams were measured during neutron beam irradiation at the BNCT facility of Edogawa hospital in Japan using a neutron beam monitor comprising a 0.07-  μ m $\\umu{\\rm m}$  LiF layer and 40-  μ m $\\umu{\\rm m}$  back-illuminated thin Si pin diode. The proton beam was continuously irradiated until a cumulative total beam charge of approximately 3 kC was achieved. The online neutron beam monitor counting rates on the neutron target unit and gold saturation activities at the patient position were simultaneously measured through the entire duration of proton beam irradiation. RESULTS: The experimental results demonstrated the long-term operation of the online neutron beam monitor positioned on the neutron target unit during the entire duration of the neutron target lifespan without significant performance deterioration. A good synchronization was observed in a correlation distribution measured using the online neutron beam monitor and the gold neutron activation method. A conversion coefficient of 1.199  Bq - 1  ${\\rm Bq}^{-1}$  g with a standard deviation of 2.5% was evaluated. The neutron beam intensity irradiating on patients within an acceptable level of ± $\\pm$  5% as per the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements was evaluated from the online neutron counting rate at the 95% confidence level. The channel numbers of the triton peak and alpha particle edge decreased linearly owing to displacement damage and total ionizing dose effects induced mainly by thermal neutrons and photons. CONCLUSIONS: Neutron doses can be accurately administered by complementing proton beam current measurements with the online neutron beam monitor. The online neutron beam monitoring technique allows monitoring fluctuations in the neutron beam intensity and tracking the degradation of the lithium target through the neutron target lifespan. Using a calibrated online neutron beam monitor, a prescribed dose can be administered in a manner similar to that in x-ray therapy, and the duration of neutron beam irradiation on the patient can be controlled in real time."

In BNCT, the biological effectiveness of boron doses is typically assessed using the compound biological effectiveness (CBE) factor. This study analyzes the impact of boron distribution on CBE values based on the microdosimetric kinetic model and Monte Carlo simulations. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Simulations were conducted on both macroscopic and microscopic scales. At the macroscopic level, the average dose absorbed by cells within tissues was modeled, whereas at the microscopic level, the microdosimetric lineal energy spectra and the microscopic dose absorbed by cell nuclei were simulated. The CBE values for various cells during BNCT were then derived from the Monte Carlo simulation data. RESULTS: Results indicate that although macroscopic boron concentrations had no significant impact on CBE values, the distribution of boron at the cellular level played a crucial role; CBE values increased as boron moved closer to the cell nucleus. CONCLUSIONS: This study proposes a method for calculating CBE values using Monte Carlo simulations, providing insights for evaluating CBE values and developing novel boron agents for BNCT."

      "abstract": "Although the combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy is regarded as a promising clinical treatment strategy, numerous clinical trials have failed to demonstrate synergistic effects. One of the key reasons is that conventional radiotherapies inevitably damage intratumoral effector immune cells. Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a precise radiotherapy that selectively kills tumor cells while sparing adjacent normal cells, by utilizing 10B agents and neutron irradiation. Therefore, combinational BNCT-immunotherapy holds promise for achieving more effective synergistic effects. Here it develops a 10B-containing polymer that self-assembled with PD-L1 siRNA to form 10B/siPD-L1 nanoparticles for combinational BNCT-immunotherapy. Unlike antibodies, PD-L1 siRNA can inhibit intracellular PD-L1 upregulated by BNCT, activating T-cell immunity while also suppressing DNA repair. This can enhance BNCT-induced DNA damage, promoting immunogenic cell death (ICD) and further amplifying the antitumor immune effect. The results demonstrated that BNCT using 10B/siPD-L1 nanoparticles precisely killed tumor cells while sparing adjacent T cells and induced a potent antitumor immune response, inhibiting distal and metastatic tumors.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the development of a 1.2 MV high-voltage direct current (DC) power supply with an SF6 insulation for an electrostatic tandem proton accelerator utilized in an accelerator-based boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) system. BNCT offers a promising alternative to traditional radiation therapy for the treatment of malignant brain tumors, head and neck cancers, and melanomas. The electrostatic tandem proton accelerator system, designed to produce H- ions and subsequently accelerate them to generate protons, represents a significant advancement in medical technology. Key milestones in the process include generating and maintaining a high-voltage DC power supply of 1.2 MV/45 mA for over 30 min, with rigorously testing conducted up to 750 kV/45 mA in ambient conditions. The system features an upgraded Cockcroft-Walton rectifier stage and incorporates a realistic load resistance, with final testing conducted in a tank filled with SF6 gas. Performance tests conducted in atmospheric and SF6 gas environments demonstrate the stable operation of the power supply up to 1.2 MV/45 mA, despite challenges such as corona discharge and electrical arcing in atmospheric environments. It demonstrates excellent long-term voltage and current stability, proving its suitability for tandem proton accelerators by reliably supplying 54 W of power to the dummy load. The developed system can enhance the effectiveness of BNCT systems by generating high-current proton beams, leading to improved treatment outcomes."

      "abstract": "Boron Neutron-Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a form of radiation therapy that relies on the highly localized and enhanced biological effects of the 10B neutron capture (BNC) reaction products to selectively kill cancer cells. The efficacy of BNCT is, therefore, strongly dependent on the 10B spatial microdistribution at a subcellular level. Fluorescent Nuclear Track Detectors (FNTDs) could be a promising technology for measuring 10B microdistribution. They allow the measurement of the tracks of charged particles, and their biocompatibility allows cell samples to be deposited and grown on their surfaces. If a layer of borated cells is deposited and irradiated by a neutron field, the energy deposited by the BNC products and their trajectories can be measured by analyzing the corresponding tracks. This allows the reconstruction of the position where the measured particles were generated, hence the microdistribution of 10B. With respect to other techniques developed to measure 10B microdistribution, FNTDs would be a non-destructive, biocompatible, relatively easy-to-use, and accessible method, allowing the simultaneous measurement of the 10B microdistribution, the LET of particles, and the evolution of the related biological response on the very same cell sample. An FNTD was tested in three irradiation conditions to study the feasibility of FNTDs for BNCT applications. The FNTD allowed the successful measurement of the correct alpha particle range and mean penetration depth expected for all the radiation fields employed. This work proved the feasibility of FNTD in reconstructing the tracks of the alpha particles produced in typical BNCT conditions, thus the 10B microdistribution. Further experiments are planned at the University of Pavia's LENA (Applied Nuclear Energy Laboratory) to test the final set-up coupling the FNTD with borated cell samples."

      "abstract": "We investigate interlayer adhesion and relaxation at interfaces between graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) monolayers in van der Waals heterostructures. The adhesion potential between graphene and hBN is calculated as a function of local lattice offset using diffusion quantum Monte Carlo methods, which provide an accurate treatment of van der Waals interactions. Combining the adhesion potential with elasticity theory, we determined the relaxed structures of graphene and hBN layers at interfaces, finding no metastable structures. The adhesion potential is well described by simple Lennard-Jones pair potentials that we parametrize using our quantum Monte Carlo data. Encapsulation of graphene between near-aligned crystals of hBN gives rise to a moiré pattern whose period is determined by the misalignment angle between the hBN crystals superimposed over the moiré superlattice previously studied in graphene on an hBN substrate. We model minibands in such supermoiré superlattices and find them to be sensitive to the 180° rotation of one of the encapsulating hBN crystals. We find that monolayer and bilayer graphene placed on a bulk hBN substrate and bulk hBN/graphene/bulk hBN systems do not relax to adopt a common lattice constant. The energetic balance is much closer for free-standing monolayer graphene/hBN bilayers and hBN/graphene/hBN trilayers. The layers in an alternating stack of graphene and hBN are predicted to strain to adopt a common lattice constant, and hence, we obtain a stable three-dimensional crystal with a distinct electronic structure."

      "abstract": "This study focused on boron (B), an essential micronutrient for plant development that becomes toxic at high concentrations, adversely affecting plant growth and yield. Phosphite (PHI) is recognized for its easy absorption by plant leaves and roots and its well-documented positive effects on plant growth. The effects of phosphite (PHI-1, 2 g L⁻1; PHI-2, 4 g L⁻1) under boron stress (B, 2 mM) were evaluated in Zea mays. Under B stress, a 58% reduction in growth was observed in maize leaves. However, PHI applied at both concentrations positively influenced growth parameters and regulated water relations in the leaves of stressed plants. Under B stress, gas exchange was restricted, the photochemical quantum efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) was suppressed, and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) values increased. Treatments with B + PHI-1 and B + PHI-2 enhanced carbon assimilation rates (A) by 37% and 23%, respectively. In OJIP transition parameters, it was observed that PHI-1 and PHI-2 treatments supported photochemical reactions by reducing the dissipated energy flux (DIo/RC). Additionally, high levels of H₂O₂ accumulation and lipid peroxidation occurred under B stress However, PHI treatments increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POX), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), mitigating oxidative damage caused by B stress. Furthermore, PHI effectively preserved ascorbate regeneration and enhanced the ascorbate-glutathione cycle, contributing to the reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. Consequently, PHI treatment demonstrated its effectiveness in mitigating boron toxicity by improving the antioxidant defense system, reducing ROS accumulation, and enhancing photosynthetic efficiency, thereby increasing stress tolerance in maize plants.",

      "abstract": "Objective.The clinical advantage of proton therapy, compared to other types of irradiations, lies in its reduced dose to normal tissue. Still, proton therapy faces challenges of normal tissue toxicity and radioresistant tumors. To combat these challenges, proton boron capture therapy (PBCT) and neutron capture enhanced particle therapy (NCEPT) were proposed to introduce high-LET radiation in the target volume.Approach. In this work, we performedin-vitroexperiments with a V79 cell line to validate PBCT and introduced a novel approach to use NCEPT in proton therapy. We quantified the effectiveness of PBCT and NCEPT with microdosimetric measurements, Monte-Carlo simulations and microdosimetric kinetic RBE model (MKM).Main results. No RBE increase was observed for PBCT. With the use of a tungsten spallation source, enough neutrons were generated in the incoming proton beam to measure significant neutron capture in the microdosimeter. However, no significant increase of RBE was detected when conventionalin vitroprotocol was followed. The resulting cell deactivation based RBE for NCEPT was found to be heavily dependent on which criteria was used to determine surviving colonies.Significance. PBCT and NCEPT are two proposed treatment modalities that may have the potential to expand the cases in which proton therapy can be beneficial. Understanding the scope of these treatment methods and developing measurement protocols to evaluate and understand their RBE impact are the first step to quantify their potential in clinical context.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: BNCT, PBT, and XT plans were optimized for nine pediatric and AYA patients with intracranial lesions. The BNCT dose calculation results were biologically effective dose converted. Lifetime attributable risk (LAR) was calculated using a calculation model proposed by Schneider et al. Statistical analysis was performed using log-linear model with mixed effects. Organs included in the radiation field were the brain, bones, and soft tissue. The difference in LAR between the three treatments for each organ and the number needed to treat (NNT), as an indicator of the number of cases required to achieve the effect of suppressing the occurrence of secondary cancers, was calculated and evaluated. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences between BNCT vs PBT and XT were confirmed for the brain, bone, soft tissue, and cumulative (P < 0.0001). Significant differences were also observed in PBT and XT, with P < 0.0001 for brain and cumulative, P = 0.0002 for bone, and P = 0.0281 for soft tissue. The cumulative NNT for BNCT vs. PBT, BNCT vs. XT, and PBT vs. XT were 162, 78.6, and 153, respectively. CONCLUSION: BNCT had a significantly lower LAR compared to PBT and XT. These findings suggest the usefulness of BNCT in pediatric and AYA patients with brain tumors from the perspective of post-irradiation secondary cancer."

Information was gathered from literature searches that used the keywords \"boron neutron capture therapy,\" \"clinical application,\" \"nanotechnology,\" and \"liposome\" so as to analyze the clinical applications of BNCT in cancer over time. The methodology includes a thorough literature review, analysis of preclinical studies, and clinical trials to assess the viability of BNCT in treating glioblastoma (GB), as an example of a hard-to-treat cancer type. Firstly, the fundamental principles of BNCT are outlined, followed by an extensive exploration of the respective application in oncology, particularly emphasizing its synergy with nanotechnology advancements. A key focus is placed on evaluating whether third-generation nanoparticles show superior efficacy compared to conventional boron-delivering systems used in BNCT. Additionally, attention is drawn to the critical analysis of safety concerns surrounding nanotechnology, which are crucial for clinical translation. Noteworthy is the clinical application of liposomes (LPs) in GB, highlighting their potential and limitations in clinical settings. Overall, the collected evidence sheds light on the high potential of BNCT in the research and development of new treatment (and diagnosis) modalities for GB and other cancer types.",

This paper describes the development of boron and nitrogen codoped graphene-diamond (BNGrD) microelectrodes with a diameter of only 200 μm for sensing EEG signals and dopamine (DA) levels, which have been developed for the first time. The optimized BNGrD microelectrode responded sensitively to both EEG and DA signals, with a signal-to-noise ratio of 9 dB for spontaneous EEG signals and a limit of detection as low as 124 nM for DA. Furthermore, the BNGrD microelectrodes demonstrate excellent repeatability, reproducibility, and stability for the detection of EEG and dopamine. These results indicate that the BNGrD microelectrode creates suitable conditions for establishing a correlation between the EEG signals and neurotransmitters. A flexible printed circuit board with BNGrD microelectrodes for an eight-channel EEG headband, portable EEG collector, and light stimulation glasses are designed. The self-designed EEG collector adopts a split design strategy of digital and analog signal modules and uses miniaturized impedance-matched BNGrD microelectrodes, which effectively reduce the noise of the electrophysiological signals. The BNGrD microelectrode-based portable EEG/electrochemical analysis system detects EEG signals and DA levels in a noninvasive and minimally invasive manner and has application prospects in remote online diagnosis and treatment of patients with emotional and cognition-related diseases.",

      "abstract": "Photocatalytic reduction of nitrate to N2 holds great significance for environmental governance. However, the selectivity of nitrate reduction to N2 is influenced by sacrificial agents and the kinds of cocatalysts (such as Pt and Ag). The presence of unconsumed sacrificial agents can aggravate environmental pollution, while noble metal-based cocatalysts increase application costs. Herein, the porous boron-doped TiO2 (B-TiO2) was successfully synthesized by using the sol-gel method with Amberlite IRA-900 as a template. The incorporation of 33% boron into TiO2 (33% B-TiO2) achieved a 100% nitrate (20 ppm) conversion rate and 94.5% N2 selectivity without the need for sacrificial agents and cocatalysts during the nitrate reduction process. The catalyst's unique multistage porous structure not only enhances the light absorption ability but also significantly provides abundant surface adsorption sites. Additionally, theoretical studies show that boron doping effectively modulates the band structure of TiO2 and increases the electron density at the Ti surface active sites, both of which are essential for achieving a high nitrate reduction efficiency. This work emphasizes the synergistic effect between morphology control and electronic structure regulation in promoting the photocatalytic reduction of nitrate to nitrogen, providing valuable insights for the photocatalytic treatment of nitrate wastewater."

However, concentrating on whether and how the biological behaviors and metabolic activities drive the microbial-mediated Cr(VI) detoxification is a study-worthy but little-known issue. In this study, Leucobacter chromiireducens CD49 isolated from heavy-metal-contaminated soil was identified to tolerate 8000.0 mg/L Cr(VI), and reduce 92.7% of 100.0 mg/L Cr(VI) within 66 h. Kinetic models were developed to determine the arithmetic relationships between Cr(VI) concentration and reaction time, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy exhibited the co-occurrence of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) on the bacterial cell surface. Furthermore, an integrated genomic-transcriptomic study was employed to explore the genetic-level response of strain CD49 to Cr(VI) stress, and most differentially expressed genes in the Cr(VI)-treatment group were enriched in biological process-related pathways, especially in quorum sensing (QS). Under the optimal conditions based on Box-Behnken Design experiments, intriguingly, boron-dependent autoinducer-2 (AI-2)-mediated QS was stimulated after H3BO3 introduction to further improve the biofilm production, biomass, and Cr(VI) reduction efficiency of strain CD49. Additionally, significantly up-regulated expression of genes chrR, chrA, and luxS further indicated the positive effect of AI-2-mediated QS on Cr(VI) reduction. Collectively, the findings pioneeringly present a chain of evidence for QS-stimulated Cr(VI) reduction, which may provide a theoretical basis for future improvement of microbial-mediated Cr(VI) remediation.",

      "abstract": "A rear emitter with a p-type boron-doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon/nanocrystalline silicon [a-Si:H(p)/nc-Si:H(p)] stack was prepared for the silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell to improve its short-circuit current density (JSC). CO2 plasma treatment (CO2 PT) was applied to a-Si:H(p) to facilitate the crystallization of the subsequently deposited nc-Si:H(p). To evaluate the effect of the CO2 PT, two different nc-Si:H(p) layers with low and high crystallinity (χC) were investigated. For the emitter with low crystallinity (χC = 21%), the solar cell efficiency could boost from 23.6 to 25.0% with a 10 s short-time CO2 PT primarily due to the significant increase in fill factor (FF) and JSC. χC of the emitter increased to 41%. For the emitter with high crystallinity (χC = 60%), the solar cell efficiency increased from 25.1 to 25.2% with a 7 s short-time CO2 PT. χC of the emitter increased to 70%. The corresponding improvement mechanisms were analyzed by combining high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements. It is considered that an appropriate short-time CO2 PT to a-Si:H(p) can make the subsequent nc-Si:H(p) more transparent and conductive by facilitating its crystallization without deteriorating the underneath passivation layer. Thus, the solar cell efficiency can be improved, especially with the enhanced FF and JSC. As a demonstration, the SHJ solar cell with the CO2 PT-treated a-Si:H(p)/nc-Si:H(p) stack emitter achieved an efficiency of up to 25.27%."

The cylindrical phantom exhibits distinct regions made from four materials (polymethyl methacrylate, calcium phosphate, air, and boric acid) to approximate a head structure with explicitly defined skin, skull, and brain tissue with a cavity and tumor within. Multiple gold activation wires were consecutively embedded in the phantom along the neutron beam central axis to provide direct measurements of 197Au(n,γ)198Au reaction rates at various depths and interfaces, enabling comparison with numerical predictions. The heterogeneous head phantom was irradiated and tested at the Tsing Hua Open-pool Reactor BNCT facility, and the measured reaction rates were compared with the results of two calculation methods: Monte Carlo simulations based on an analytical geometry model and TPS predictions based on voxel-based geometry created from computed tomography images. The specifications of the phantom and reported results can serve as a reference suite of test problems for BNCT dosimetry.",

At baseline, his creatinine level had been 0.98 mg/dL. The vital signs and physical examination were normal. A urinalysis showed protein and numerous red cells per high-power field, and needle-shaped crystals were observed. A plane computed tomography showed hematoma within the extensive ureter. However, hydronephrosis was not recognized. Immediate discontinuation of BNCT and supplemental fluids reduced gross hematuria, increased urine, and creatinine decreased to 0.97 mg/dL. BNCT is an innovative radiation therapy that targets tumor cells by inducing a nuclear reaction between 10B and neutrons within the tumor. However, there have been no reported cases of treatment-related boron crystals causing ureteral injury that leads to acute kidney injury, and oncologists should be aware of this potential risk."

Here we performed comprehensive analysis of mRNA expression using human oral squamous carcinoma SAS cells after BPA-BNCT.

NF-κB pathway genes were also activated after BNCT. The early increase of the gene product of CSF2 gene, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), in culture supernatant of SAS cells was observed by ELISA analysis after BPA-BNCT at a setting dose of 24 Gy-eq. The GM-CSF level was also increased after equivalent dose of gamma-ray and carbon beam irradiation.

Designing adsorbents with highly active adsorption sites is one effective method to improve their adsorption capacities. In this study, porous h-BN aerogels containing multiple defect types (DP-BN) were synthesized by using salt templates. The experimental results showed that DP-BN had an extremely low density. With outstanding adsorption capacity for tetracycline (TC), its maximum adsorption capacity was 1620.37 mg/g, which was 2.6 times higher than that reported in the known literature (623.018 mg/g). DP-BN adsorbed TC quickly, and its rate was influenced by liquid film diffusion, pore diffusion, and diffusion to the active adsorption site. The adsorption process was dominated by chemisorption and could take place spontaneously. The adsorption of TC by DP-BN was exothermic. As the environmental temperature increased, the adsorption capacity of DP-BN increased significantly. DP-BN exhibited excellent reusability. After five cycles, the adsorption removal rate remained up to 99.93%. Overall, the high adsorption capacity of DP-BN for TC was attributed to its abundant active adsorption sites, Π-Π interactions, and intermolecular interactions. This study provided a new idea to modulate the microstructure and improve the adsorption performance of h-BN, hoping to accelerate the application of h-BN in wastewater treatment.",

However, the potential role and underlying mechanisms of B in alleviating antimony (Sb) toxicity in rice remain unexplored. In this study, we investigated the effects of H₃BO₃ supplementation (30, 50, and 75 μM) on morphological growth, physiological and biochemical traits, Sb content, and the subcellular distribution of Sb in rice plants under 100 μM Sb stress during the seedling stage in a hydroponic system. The results revealed that Sb toxicity severely impaired rice growth, reducing shoot biomass by 38.3%, shoot and root length by 38.9% and 23.2%, and leaf relative water content by 15.5%. Supplementation with 30 μM B mitigated these adverse effects by enhancing photosynthesis and chlorophyll synthesis, restoring root activity, and improving oxidative balance through increased antioxidant enzyme activities in rice tissues. Furthermore, B supplementation significantly reduced Sb concentration in roots by 56.28%, while promoting Sb distribution in the cell wall (CW) fraction. Scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDS) microanalysis confirmed that B enhanced Sb adsorption on root CWs. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis indicated increased carboxyl groups in the CWs following B application under Sb treatment. Moreover, B supplementation increased the levels of pectin and hemicellulose and elevated pectin methylesterase (PME) activity by 22.0%, 69.0%, and 29.0% in roots, respectively, thus promoting Sb chelation onto the CWs. Taken together, our results provide a scientific basis and theoretical guidance for applying B to alleviate Sb toxicity in crops.",

The high linear energy transfer products of the ensuing reaction deposit their energy at the cell level, sparing normal tissue. Although progress in accelerator-based BNCT has led to renewed interest in this cancer treatment modality, in vivo dose monitoring during treatment still remains not feasible and several approaches are under investigation. While Compton imaging presents various advantages over other imaging methods, it typically requires long reconstruction times, comparable with BNCT treatment duration. METHODS: This study aims to develop deep neural network models to estimate the dose distribution by using a simulated dataset of BNCT Compton camera images. The models pursue the avoidance of the iteration time associated with the maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization algorithm (MLEM), enabling a prompt dose reconstruction during the treatment. The U-Net architecture and two variants based on the deep convolutional framelets framework have been used for noise and artifact reduction in few-iteration reconstructed images. RESULTS: This approach has led to promising results in terms of reconstruction accuracy and processing time, with a reduction by a factor of about 6 with respect to classical iterative algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: This can be considered a good reconstruction time performance, considering typical BNCT treatment times. Further enhancements may be achieved by optimizing the reconstruction of input images with different deep learning techniques."

Boron (B) is an essential micronutrient that performs an important role in many functions in plants; however, its protective role under salt stress is poorly understood, especially in long-lived woody plants. In this study, we conducted an indoor experiment under simulated tidal conditions with four treatments (10‱ salinity, 40‱ salinity, 40‱ salinity + 100 μM B, and 40‱ salinity + 500 μM B) and three mangrove species (Avicennia marina, Aegiceras corniculatum, and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza) to investigate the effects of exogenous B on salt tolerance in plant growth, morphology, physiology, and leaf anatomy. The results showed that exogenous low-concentration B treatment (100 μM B) improved the performance of mangrove species under high salinity stress, especially in terms of physiology and leaf anatomy, while high-concentration B treatment (500 μM B) had adverse effects. Additionally, we found that the response to exogenous B varied among species in physiology and leaf anatomy, such as proline, malondialdehyde, activity of antioxidant enzymes, palisade tissue, and spongy tissue, which may be related to the salt tolerance of different species. This study may provide useful insights into the alleviation of salt stress by B in mangrove growth and development, which may facilitate mangrove cultivation and afforestation in a saline environment."

However, the development of clinically approved boron drugs remains challenging. We have previously reported on self-forming nanoparticles for drug delivery consisting of a biodegradable polymer, namely, \"AB-type\" Lactosome® nanoparticles (AB-Lac particles)- highly loaded with hydrophobic B compounds, namely o-Carborane (Carb) or 1,2-dihexyl-o-Carborane (diC6-Carb), and the latter (diC6-Carb) especially showed the \"molecular glue\" effect. Here we present in vivo and ex vivo studies with human pancreatic cancer (AsPC-1) cells to find therapeutically optimal formulas and the appropriate treatment conditions for these particles. The biodistribution of the particles was assessed by the tumor/normal tissue ratio (T/N) in terms of tumor/muscle (T/M) and tumor/blood (T/B) ratios using near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging with indocyanine green (ICG). The in vivo and ex vivo accumulation of B delivered by the injected AB-Lac particles in tumor lesions reached a maximum by 12 h post-injection. Irradiation studies conducted both in vitro and in vivo showed that AB-Lac particles-loaded with either 10B-Carb or 10B-diC6-Carb significantly inhibited the growth of AsPC-1 cancer cells or strongly inhibited their growth, with the latter method being significantly more effective. Surprisingly, a similar in vitro and in vivo irradiation study showed that ICG-labeled AB-Lac particles alone, i.e., without any 10B compounds, also revealed a significant inhibition. Therefore, we expect that our ICG-labeled AB-Lac particles-loaded with 10B compound(s) may be a novel and promising candidate for providing not only NIRF imaging for a practical diagnosis but also the dual therapeutic effects of induced cancer cell death, i.e., \"theranostics\".",

      "abstract": "Clinical research in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) has been conducted worldwide. Currently, the Monte Carlo (MC) method is the only dose calculation algorithm implemented in the treatment planning system for the clinical treatment of BNCT. We previously developed the MC-RD calculation method, which combines the MC method and the removal-diffusion (RD) equation, for fast dose calculation in BNCT. This study aimed to verify the partial-MC-RD calculation method, which utilizes the MC-RD calculation method for a portion of the entire neutron energy range, in terms of calculation accuracy and time as the dose calculation method. We applied the partial-MC-RD calculation method to calculate the total dose for head phantom, comprising soft tissue, brain tissue, and bone. The calculation time and accuracy were evaluated based on the full-MC method. Our accuracy verifications indicated that the partial-MC-RD calculation was mostly comparable with full-MC calculation in the accuracy. However, the assumptions and approximation used in the RD calculation mainly occurred the discrepancy from the full-MC calculation result. Additionally, the partial-MC-RD calculation reduced the time required to approximately 45% for the irradiation to the top and cheek region of head phantom, compared to the full-MC calculation. In conclusion, the MC-RD calculation method can be the basis of a fast dose calculation method in BNCT.",

      "abstract": "Photon (X-ray) radiotherapy is the most common treatment used in cancer therapy. However, the exposure of normal tissues and organs at risk to ionising radiation often results in a significant incidence of low-grade adverse side effects, whilst high-grade toxicities also occur at concerningly high rates. As an alternative, boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) aims to create densely ionising helium and lithium ions directly within cancer cells, thus sparing the surrounding normal cells and tissues but also leading to significantly more effective tumour control than X-rays. Although very promising for patients with recurring and highly invasive tumours, BNCT does not currently have widespread use worldwide, in part due to limited and reliable neutron sources for clinical use. Another limitation is devising strategies leading to the selective and optimal accumulation of boron within the cancer cells. Boronophenylalanine (BPA) is currently the major compound used in BNCT which takes advantage of the amino acid transporter LAT1 that is overexpressed in a number of human cancers. Additionally, there is a lack of in-depth knowledge regarding the impact of BNCT on cellular DNA, and the molecular mechanisms that are responsive to the treatment, which are important in developing optimal therapeutic strategies using BNCT, are unclear. In this review, we highlight the current knowledge of the radiobiology of BNCT acquired from in vitro and in vivo studies, particularly in the context of DNA damage and repair, but also present evidence of established and new boron-containing compounds aimed at enhancing the specificity and effectiveness of the treatment.",

Despite the growing demand for optically active BODIPYs, the synthesis of chiral 3-amino-BODIPYs, particularly the catalytic asymmetric version, remains a challenge. Herein, we report the synthesis of boron-stereogenic 3-amino-BODIPYs via a palladium-catalyzed desymmetric C-N cross-coupling of prochiral 3,5-dihalogen-BODIPYs. This approach features a broad substrate scope, excellent functional group tolerance, high efficiency, and remarkable enantioselectivities, under mild reaction conditions. Further stereospecific formation of chiral 3,5-diamino-BODIPYs, along with an investigation into the photophysical properties of the resulting optical BODIPYs are also explored. This asymmetric protocol not only enriches the chemical space of chiroptical BODIPY dyes but also contributes to the realm of chiral boron chemistry."

In this study, we developed a small molecule boron carrier, biotinyl-closo-dodecaborate conjugate with an iodophenyl moiety (BBC-IP), incorporating biotin as a ligand for biotin receptors overexpressed in various cancer cells, alongside an albumin ligand and boron source. BBC-IP exhibited high water solubility, minimal cytotoxicity, and superior cellular uptake compared to BPA in both human and mouse cancer cells. Biodistribution studies revealed that BBC-IP achieved enhanced tumor accumulation (9.7 μg [B]/g, 3 h) in mouse colon tumors, surpassing BPA's accumulation levels (7.2 μg [B]/g, 3 h) at a dose of 15 mg [B]/kg. However, despite this improved tumor accumulation, BPA demonstrated superior BNCT efficacy. The intracellular localization of boron agents in tumor cells revealed that BPA localized throughout the cell, whereas BBC-IP localized mainly in the cytoplasm. These results indicate the intratumoral localization, as well as tumor accumulation are critical for the efficacy of novel BNCT agents."

We demonstrate a significant enhancement in adsorption capacity for boron removal facilitated by a flow-through electrosorption cell, and outline the results of surface characterization and electrochemical activity tests of the fabricated nanodiamond (ND) anodes (e.g., Pristine ND and A-NDs annealed at 800 and 1200 ℃). To identify the role of DO in the electrosorption system, we compared the results obtained in the natural state (without gas purging) with those obtained with ambient air and N2 gas purging. In particular, the degree of electrode deterioration (change in the cathode carbon compositional ratio) during the charging process was characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Overall, our system exhibits a favorable boron removal capability (sorption capacity reached 10.5 μmol/g) and energy consumption of <3.4 kWh g-B. Finally, we developed a prediction model for effluent properties using time-series machine learning algorithms based on various electrosorption variables (e.g., DO, pH dynamics, charging/discharging modes and times, and voltage), Through post-process of constructed ML model, voltage showed significant predictive importance. Additionally, the necessity of sequential modeling was emphasized by SHAP analysis. The application of ML algorithms provided a novel approach for the system optimization of electrified water treatment.",

METHODS: Articles related to BNCT published before 2023-12-31 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection database. VOSviewer, R, and CiteSpace were used for bibliometric analysis and visualization. RESULTS: A total of 3347 related publications from 1975 to 2023 were retrieved. Since a burst of published documents in 1992, the past three decades have witnessed continuous investigations into BNCT-related studies. Japan was the most productive country (794, 23.72%), followed by the USA (792, 23.66%), while the latter had the most citations. Kyoto University was the most influential institution. Ono K was the most prolific author, and Applied Radiation and Isotopes was the most popular journal. Ono K was the author that had the most total citations, followed by Barth RF. \"Carborane\", \"boronophenylalanine\", \"glioblastoma\", \"sodium borocaptate\", \"cancer\" and \"drug delivery\" were the most frequent keywords. The article \"Dendrimers and dendritic polymers in drug delivery\" had the most citations, whereas \"Boron delivery agents for neutron capture therapy of cancer\" had the highest outbreak value. CONCLUSION: Over the past three decades, research on BNCT has expanded significantly, with the development of novel boron carriers with improved medicinal characteristics being the most extensively investigated area. Future research will likely focus on the validation and modification of current BNCT treatment modalities using conventional boron agents in brain tumors, accelerator-based neutron sources and the application of BNCT in more clinical scenarios."

The moderator consists of 2 parts, the epithermal neutron moderator and the thermal neutron moderator. The epithermal neutron moderator is made of MgF2, and the epithermal neutron port is oriented at 45° with respect to the proton beam direction, the thermal neutron moderator is composed of polyethylene (PE) and heavy water, and is positioned at 90° with respect to the proton beam direction. The in-air beam characteristics at both neutron ports comply with the recommendations of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for epithermal neutron and thermal BNCT radiation fields, respectively. The modified Snyder head phantom is used for the in-phantom study. It is shown that the thermal neutron flux at the thermal port peaks at the skin, and the thermal neutron flux at the epithermal port has a maximum value at a depth of approximately 3 cm in the head phantom. The photon equivalent dose and the photon-isoeffective dose are employed to evaluate the dose distribution at the epithermal neutron port. The photon-isoeffective dose shows 35%-15% lower value than that calculated by the photon equivalent dose in the treatment region, and the advanced depth, double dose depth and triple dose depth calculated by the photon-isoeffective dose are shorter than these calculated by the photon equivalent dose."

The catechol-boron dynamic bond plays a vital role in promoting the diradicaloid formation and stabilizing the formed diradicaloid segments. The diradicaloid segment in the polymer has a triplet ground state and a thermally populated doublet state, which has been confirmed by the EPR study. Although not conjugated, the polymer still exhibits an electrical conductivity over 10-6 S cm-1. The SQUID study shows that the polymer is Pauli paramagnetic, indicating that the metallic domain exists in this non-conjugated polymer. This diradicaloid-containing polymer is stable toward long-term storage (over 6 months) and thermal treatment over 200 °C, but can be easily depolymerized when treated with methanol."

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose the design of extending collimators aimed at reducing the radiation dose received by patients with normal tissues and protecting organs at risk in Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT). Three types of extended collimators are studied: Type 1, which is a traditional design; Type 2, which is built upon Type 1 by incorporating additional polyethylene material containing lithium fluoride (PE(LiF)); Type 3, which adds lead (Pb) to Type 1. We evaluated the dose distribution characteristics of the above-extended collimators using Monte Carlo methods simulations under different configurations: in air, in a homogeneous phantom, and a humanoid phantom model. Firstly, the neutron and gamma-ray fluxes at the collimator outlet of the three designs showed no significant changes, thus it can be expected that their therapeutic effects on tumors will be similar. Then, the dose distribution outside the irradiation field was studied. The results showed that, compared with Type 1, Type 2 has a maximum reduction of 57.14% in neutron leakage dose, and Type 3 has a maximum reduction of 21.88% in gamma-ray leakage dose. This will help to reduce the radiation dose to the local skin. Finally, the doses of different organs were simulated. The results showed that the neutron dose of Type 2 was relatively low, especially for the skin, thyroid, spinal cord, and left lung, with the neutron dose reduced by approximately 20.34%, 16.18%, 26.05%, and 18.91% respectively compared to Type 1. Type 3 collimator benefits in reducing gamma-ray dose for the thyroid, esophagus, and left lung organs, with gamma-ray dose reductions of around 10.81%, 9.45%, and 10.42% respectively. This indicates that attaching PE(LiF) or Pb materials to a standard collimator can suppress the dose distribution of patient organs, which can provide valuable insights for the design of extended collimators in BNCT.",

METHODS: In this work, we extend a previously published method for neutron capture detection and discrimination. A Geant4 Monte Carlo model was designed, with the simulated irradiation of a poly(methyl methacrylate) phantom and cubic 10B insert with carbon and helium ion beams and various shielding configurations. RESULTS: In the free-space configuration, shielding the crystal actually decreases the ratio of true/false positive detections (RTF) by more than 50% and increases the activation of the detector. In a closed-space configuration with a model of the beamline neutron fluence, RTF also decreases with shielding, although activation decreases in this case. However, for a detector with boron present in the printed circuit boards (PCBs), shielding with a thin layer of Gd2O3 improves RTF by up to 21%. CONCLUSIONS: Shielding of the detector crystal itself is unnecessary as shielding actually degrades discrimination accuracy relative to the unshielded detector. However, if the detector PCBs contain boron, then shielding the electronics provides a valuable increase in overall detector selectivity.",

      "abstract": "To address the limitations, such as complex treatment processes, reduced durability, and poor reusability, of typical micro- and nanoscale adsorbents for boron removal, a simple method for removing residual boron is introduced using a multiscale porous anion-exchangeable sponge (MP-AES) that electrostatically attracts boron in areas with locally high pH. Because commercially available anion-permselective materials are absent, custom nanoporous materials surrounded by microporous melamine foam are used to increase surface area and durability under repeated compression. The hydrophilic porous sponge facilitates liquid diffusion, enhancing adsorption in the user-friendly system. Our MP-AES exhibits remarkable boric-acid-adsorption efficiency, achieving up to 21 mg/g in a 100 mg/L solution within 20 min. Under low-solute conditions (2 mg/L), over 90 % of boron is removed within 10 min, which is a 120 % improvement relative to that of the commercial resin, IRA-743. Notably, the MP-AES sustains its adsorption capacity over at least 10 regeneration cycles with basic treatment and withstands multiple compressions (80 % strain) over 100 cycles without experiencing structural failure. When tested with a reverse osmosis permeate, the MP-AES meets the stringent drinking water standards (0.5-1 mg/L). This sustainable, efficient, and convenient adsorption system has the potential for widespread application in water treatment technologies."

      "abstract": "Over the past decade, Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon) solar cells have emerged as a leading technology for high-efficiency silicon solar cells. Conventional metallization processes using silver/aluminum (Ag/Al) pastes encounter significant hurdles due to reliability risks and insufficient contact quality. Recent advancements in laser-induced metallization technologies, particularly laser-enhanced contact optimization (LECO), offer promising solutions. However, the mechanism of silver-silicon (Ag-Si) contact formation on the P+ emitter of TOPCon cells via LECO processing remains incompletely understood. This study designs and prepares two types of glass frits (GF-A and GF-B) for TOPCon cells and investigates the electrical properties of corresponding devices. Advanced techniques are employed to examine the Ag-Siinterfaces. The results demonstrate that GF-A-based TOPCon cells (Cell-A) outperformed GF-B-based cells (Cell-B) due to the construction of a current-confined Ag-Si interface. A composite conductive model for the Ag-Si interfaces by LECO treatment is introduced, revealing the nano-size Joule-heating to achieve the Ag-Si eutectic structure as the underlying formation mechanism. This work contributes to the understanding of metal-silicon contact optimization in solar cells and introduces novel methodologies for laser-induced synthesis and micro-nano interface engineering."

      "abstract": "Crystallization process is critical for enhancing the crystallinity, regulating the crystal orientation of polycrystalline thin films, as well as repairing defects within the films. For quasi-1D Sb2Se3 photovoltaic materials, the preparation of Sb2Se3 thin films still faces great challenges in adjusting orientation and defect properties, which limits the device performance. In this study, a novel post-treatment strategy is developed that uses a low melting point B2O3 coating layer as a flux to drive the recrystallization of Sb2Se3, thereby regulating the micro-orientation of thermal evaporation-derived Sb2Se3 films and optimizing their electrical properties. Mechanistic investigations show that B2O3 exhibits stronger adsorption with (hk1) planes of Sb2Se3 to induce a vertical orientation growth of the film, while blocking the volatilization channels of Se and inhibiting Se vacancy defects by interacting with Sb2Se3. The Sb2Se3 film with [hk1] preferential orientation and suppressed deep-level defects promotes the effective transport of charge carriers in solar cells. As a result, the B2O3-treated device delivers a champion efficiency of 9.37% without MgF2 anti-reflection coating, which is currently the highest efficiency in Sb2Se3 solar cells achieved by thermal evaporation method. This study provides a new method and mechanism for regulating optical and electrical properties of low-dimensional inorganic thin films."

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of boron-doped nano hydroxyapatite grafts on craniofacial bone regeneration in critical bone defects in the mandibular corpus of rats, in terms of scintigraphic and histopathological aspects. Forty Wistar albino rats, with an average weight of 200-220 g, aged 16-18 weeks, and all male, were used in the study. The rats were randomly assigned to five groups, each containing 8 rats, as follows: group C1 (no procedure applied to the mandible), group C2 (surgical defect created in the mandible but no treatment applied), group nHA (nano hydroxyapatite applied to the surgical defect area), group nHA + B1 (nano hydroxyapatite + 1% boron applied to the surgical defect area), and group nHA + B2 (nano hydroxyapatite + 2% boron applied to the surgical defect area). A standard 4 × 4 mm full-thickness transosseous bone defect was created in the mandibular corpus of all rats, except for those in group C1. The bone defect in the rats in group C2 was left to heal naturally. Nano hydroxyapatite (nHA), nano hydroxyapatite + 1% boron, and nano hydroxyapatite + 2% boron were applied to the surgical defect areas of the other three groups, respectively. Bone scintigraphy was performed on all rats on days 0 (following the surgical procedure) and 28 of the experimental period. At the end of the 28th day, the animals were sacrificed, and tissue samples were collected for histological examination. A standard grading system was used to evaluate fracture healing. When the groups were compared in terms of bone healing histopathological scores, a statistically significant difference was observed between group C1 and the other groups (p < 0.005). In the statistical evaluation made according to the histopathological mean scores, the least improvement was observed in group C2. No statistically significant difference was observed between group nHA and group nHA + B1 and group C2 and between group nHA and group nHA + B1 in terms of bone healing scores (p > 0.005). A statistically significant difference was found between group nHA + B2 and group C2 (p = 0.026). Although there was no statistically significant difference in histopathological scores, the mean score closest to group C1 was observed in group nHA + B2. A statistically significant difference was observed between the groups in the scintigraphic evaluation performed on the 28th day of the experimental procedure, and the difference was between group C1 and group nHA + B1 and between group nHA and group nHA + B1 (p = 0.004; p = 0.028, p < 0.005). In the comparison of the values obtained on days 0 and 28 within the group, a statistically significant change was observed in group nHA + B1 and group nHA + B2 (p < 0.005). When the results of the present study were evaluated, it was thought that the boron-doped nHA graft biomaterials may have positive effects on bone healing. Providing a different perspective for the development of an alternative new treatment modality that can be locally applied in the treatment of fractures a serious and common health problem can be interpreted as an important outcome of the present study. We believe that this study will serve as a preliminary study for more comprehensive future studies on this subject."

The resulting biochar exhibited a large specific surface area (933.39 m2/g), a rich porous structure (1.044 cm3/g), and abundant active sites. Consequently, the prepared boron-doped porous biochar exhibited higher efficiency in adsorbing tetracycline with a maximum adsorption capacity of 413.223 mg/g, which significantly exceeded that of unmodified biochar and most commercial and reported adsorbents. The correlation analysis between the adsorption capacity and adsorbent characteristics revealed that the formation of the -BCO2 group enhanced π-π electron donor-acceptor interactions between boron-doped porous biochar and tetracycline. This mechanism mainly contributed to the enhanced adsorption of tetracycline by boron-doped porous biochar. Additionally, the as-prepared boron-doped porous biochar exhibited broad applications in removing antibiotics (tetracycline), phenolics (bisphenol A), and dyes (methylene blue and rhodamine B). Moreover, the boron-doped porous biochar exhibited satisfactory stability, and its adsorption capacity can be nearly completely regenerated through simple heat treatment. This study provides new insights into the effectiveness of boron-doped carbonaceous materials in removing antibiotic contaminants.",

In this study, Fe-doped graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanomaterials were used to construct Fe-Nx sites, and the electronic structure was tuned by boron nitride quantum dots (BNQDs), thereby optimizing PAA activation for the degradation of antibiotics. The BNQDs-modified Fe-doped g-C3N4 catalyst (BNQDs-FCN) achieved an excellent reaction rate constant of 0.0843 min-1, marking a 21.6-fold improvement over the carbon nitride (CN)-based PAA system. DFT calculations further corroborate the superior adsorption capacity of the Fe-Nx sites for PAA, facilitating its activation. Charge transfer mechanisms, with PAA serving as an electron acceptor, were identified as the source of high-valent iron-oxo species. Moreover, the BNQDs-FCN system preferentially targets oxygen-containing functional groups in antibiotic structures, elucidating the selective attack patterns of these highly electrophilic species. This research not only elucidates the pivotal role of high-valent iron-oxo species in pollutant degradation within the PAA-AOPs framework but also pioneers a wastewater treatment system characterized by excellent degradation efficiency coupled with low ecological risk, thereby laying the groundwork for applications in wastewater management and beyond.",

      "abstract": "Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is an advanced binary tumor-cell-selected heavy-particle radiotherapy used for treating invasive malignant tumors. However, its clinical applications have been impeded by the rapid metabolism and insufficient tumor-specific accumulation of boron agents. To tackle this issue, we develop a smart boron nanosensitizer (BATBN) capable of transforming its size in response to cancer biomarker for optimal balance between penetration and retention of boron-10 for BNCT. BATBN comprises an ultrasmall boron quantum dots (BQD) core (4 nm) conjugated with cell-penetrating peptides, which facilitates its cellular uptake and deep tumor penetration. In the tumor microenvironment, the tumor biomarker can specifically initiate a self-condensation reaction of BATBN, leading to the formation of larger-sized nanoaggregates. Due to such a specific intratumoral transformation, BATBN demonstrates a 2.4-fold increase in intratumoral boron concentration and a 5.0-fold increase in tumor retention time compared to the BQDs. Thus, the tumor volume of the BATBNs-treatment group is 2.7-fold smaller than that of BQDs in preclinical tumor models after 21 days of neutron irradiation treatment. This study presents a supramolecular strategy to endow BNCT agents with the biomarker-activated size interconversion, permitting precise and efficient BNCT for cancer treatment.",

While the therapy's potential in precise targeting is well-recognized, a critical bottleneck remains in the accurate positioning of patients for treatment delivery. This study proposes a novel automated robotic-assisted patient positioning system specifically engineered for BNCT applications. The system utilizes high-precision industrial robotics and is fully integrated with NeuMANTA, a proprietary treatment planning system designed for BNCT. Through a systematic workflow, the robotic arm algorithmically calculates and executes the patient's positioning based on the treatment plan, thus enhancing the accuracy and efficacy of the treatment. We validate the positioning system using an anthropomorphic phantom and evaluate the dosimetric impact of positional deviations. The results indicate that the system achieves high accuracy, with a maximum observational deviation of 3 mm in Source-to-Skin Distance (SSD) and 2 mm along the surface. Dosimetric analysis reveals that the resulting dose changes are less than 1% in surface orientation deviations and less than 5% in SSD orientation deviations. The study concludes that the robotic patient positioning system substantially advances in BNCT treatment delivery. This work not only sets a new benchmark for patient positioning in BNCT, but also provides a comprehensive framework for integrating advanced robotics into radiotherapy, paving the way for more precise and effective cancer treatments.",

      "abstract": "The use of electrochemical oxidation with boron-doped diamond (BDD) as an anode has been demonstrated to be an effective means of removing dissolved organic matter (DOM) from biologically treated waste leachate. However, in the presence of chloride ions, undesired chlorine evolution occurs on the anode; this forms chlorinated DOM, mostly of unknown molecular composition. We investigate the molecular composition and formation mechanism of chlorinated DOM during electrochemical oxidation process of biologically treated leachate DOM. At a current density of 8 mA/cm2, after 120 min of electrolysis, 479 unknown chlorinated DOMs were detected in the treated effluent, comprising 21.55% of the total. The unknown species are dominated by oxygen-rich, highly unsaturated structures, and exhibit higher oxidation degrees, lower unsaturation, and lower aromaticity compared to the removed nonchlorinated DOM. An additional 43.63 mg/L of known chlorinated DOM species, predominantly dichloroacetic and trichloroacetic acids, also accumulate in the treated effluent. Introducing hydroxyl radicals (HO•) to the anode surface forms reactive chlorine species including chlorine radical (Cl•), dichlorine radical (Cl2•-), and hypochlorous acid/hypochlorite (HOCl/OCl-); the concentration of HOCl/OCl- reaches 529.2 mg/L. These species react with reduced and aromatic dissolved organic matter via reaction pathways such as chlorine substitution for hydrogen (Cl+H-) and the HOCl addition reaction (HO+Cl+) to generate unknown chlorinated DOM species; the known chlorinated DOM are formed afterward via ring opening and dealkylation pathways. Our results provide a theory for the prevention and control of chlorinated DOM during treatment of chlorine-laden organic wastewater by an electrochemical oxidation system with a boron-doped diamond anode.",

Early detection of lesions is crucial, with non-invasive methods preferred in the initial stages of caries for enamel remineralization and demineralization prevention. This study aimed to assess the impact of varying contents of boron-doped hydroxyapatite-chitosan nano-composite on the microhardness of demineralized enamel. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Boron-doped hydroxyapatite-chitosan nano-composites at concentrations of 0%, 5%, 10%, and 15% were prepared using the sol-gel method. Thirty intact human premolars were collected to evaluate tooth remineralization. The teeth were divided into buccal and lingual halves, subjected to pH cycling for 14 days to demineralize the enamel surface. Subsequently, the specimens were randomly divided into four groups (n = 15) based on the application of remineralizing materials: Group 1 - Hydroxyapatite-chitosan nano-composite (HApC); Group 2 - Boron-doped hydroxyapatite-chitosan nano-composite (B@HApC) with 5% boron concentration; Group 3 - Boron-doped hydroxyapatite-chitosan nano-composite (B@HApC) with 10% boron concentration; and Group 4 - Boron-doped hydroxyapatite-chitosan nano-composite (B@HApC) with 15% boron concentration. Microhardness was measured at three points using a Vickers hardness test (300 g force for 10 s). RESULTS: The study revealed a significant difference between the nano-composite groups containing 5%, 10%, and 15% boron compared to the control group (p < 0.001). The highest microhardness was observed in the 15% boron group (49.42), with the control group showing the lowest microhardness (20.15). Pairwise comparisons of microhardness indicated a significant difference between Group 4 and the control group (p < 0.05). However, no significant differences were found between Groups 2 and 3, Groups 2 and 4, and Groups 3 and 4 (p > 0.05). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) results supported the microhardness findings, showing a mineral layer covering the porous structure resulting from enamel surface demineralization in the intervention groups, highlighting the effectiveness of boron in enhancing the microhardness of demineralized enamel. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that a content of 15% boron in B@HApC and higher led to increased microhardness of demineralized enamel. Additionally, content of 5% and 10% boron in the nano-composite also improved microhardness, although not to a statistically significant extent.",

      "abstract": "Neutron activation dosimetry is the primary method for the determination of the neutron flux or fluence, and in general, it is sensitive to the thermal and resonance energy ranges (radiative capture reactions- ( n , γ )  reactions) and the fast energy range (threshold reactions). However, there are very few nuclear reactions which are sensitive specifically to neutrons in the intermediate-epithermal-energy region. This energy region, along with the fast energy range, will become particularly important in the development and deployment of new reactor technologies (Generation IV reactors and Small Modular Reactors-SMRs), which are currently being championed as technologies enabling a meaningful contribution to decarbonization and the fight against climate change, as well as nuclear fusion. The epithermal neutron energy range is also of particular importance for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT), a neutron-based cancer therapy, particularly effective for the treatment of head and neck cancer, malignant meningioma, melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. This work investigates and demonstrates the applicability of a particular set of ( n , γ )  reactions in conjunction with boron-based neutron filters to achieve sensitivity in the epithermal energy region, and discusses avenues for future research in this context.",

      "abstract": "Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) stands out as a noninvasive potential modality for invasive malignant tumors, with boron drugs playing a crucial role in its efficacy. Nevertheless, the development of boron drugs with biodegradability, as well as high permeability and retention effects, continues to present significant challenges. Here, we fabricate a size-tunable boron nanoreactor (TBNR) via assembling boron nitride quantum dots (BNQDs) and Fe3+ for tumor BNCT and chemodynamic (CDT) synergistic treatment. The obtained TBNR with an appropriate size exhibits superior tumor accumulation and retention. Upon stimulation by the tumor microenvironment (TME), the contained Fe3+ undergo redox reactions with glutathione (GSH) to produce Fe2+ Fenton reagents, which in turn activate CDT function and simultaneously induce TBNR depolymerization. Subsequently, the released ultrasmall BNQDs exhibit intra-deep penetration characteristic and are fully enriched at the tumor site. The in vivo experiments reveal that TBNR possesses excellent biocompatibility and superior synergistic anti-tumor ability post neutron irradiation, resulting in significant shrinkage of subcutaneous 4T1 tumors. Moreover, the TBNR-mediated BNCT has triggered an obvious immune response, which contributes to the long-term suppression of tumors after neutron irradiation. To conclude, this study provides a new approach for constructing more efficient versatile nanocarriers for BNCT-induced combination cancer therapies.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, mushroom poisoning has been one of the most important factors of food poisoning in China, timely identification of the toxins contained in mushrooms is crucial for the treatment of patients. In this study, boric acid carbon dots (BA-CDs) can undergo specific boron affinity reactions with amatoxins toxins containing o-dihydroxyl groups by means of boric acid groups. Functional covalent organic framework (COF) and BA-CDs were combined to design a adsorbent with boric acid group (COF@VBC@BA-CDs) was designed to meet the requirements of both fluorescent and pretreated materials for amatoxins. The mushrooms and urine samples were rapid screening using fluorescence detection, and then, for positive samples, the target analytes on the COF@VBC@BA-CDs are collected and eluted for next liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) detection. According to the fluorescence characteristics of COF@VBC@BA-CDs, the fluorescence quenching intensity was linearly correlated with the concentration (2-200 μg/L) and the detection limit was 1.2 μg/L. Meanwhile, the detection limit of LC-MS/MS was 0.5 μg/kg for musroom and 0.2 μg/L for urine, as well as the recovery rate was 72.7-110.1%. This noval method meets the methodological requirements and can be used for actual sample analysis.",
