      "abstract": "Histidine-derived carbon dots (His-CDs) were synthesized to detect staurosporine-induced apoptosis in T lymphoma (Jurkat) cells. The His-CDs were characterized for their physical and chemical properties including size, morphology, fluorescence, and surface functionality. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed a spherical morphology with an average size of 11.4 ± 3.4 nm. Fluorescence analysis showed maximum excitation at 338 nm and emission at 415 nm, attributed to the carbon dots' quantum confinement effect and surface defects. FTIR and SEM-EDS confirmed the presence of hydroxyl, amine, aromatic rings, and alkyl (C-H) functional groups and carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen elemental composition in ratios of 52%, 24.8%, and 23.3%, respectively. His-CDs were evaluated for cytotoxicity and apoptosis detection in Jurkat cells. Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry analysis demonstrated concentration-dependent fluorescence, suggesting effective cellular uptake of His-CDs. The apoptotic-sensing capability of His-CDs was tested using staurosporine, an apoptosis inducer. A concentration-dependent increase in fluorescence was observed with increasing staurosporine concentrations, indicating the His-CDs' sensitivity to apoptosis. The time-dependent fluorescence increases were noted with prolonged staurosporine exposure. Z-DEVD-FMK, a caspase-3 inhibitor, confirmed that the apoptosis detected by His-CDs was caspase-3 dependent, as co-treatment reduced His-CDs' fluorescence in the cell. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that His-CDs are biocompatible, sensitive apoptosis sensors and hold the potential for monitoring apoptotic pathways in cellular systems."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced angiogenesis plays a critical role in tumor progression and metastasis, making it an important therapeutic target in cancer treatment. Suppressing angiogenesis can effectively limit tumor growth and metastasis. However, despite advancements in understanding angiogenic pathways, effective strategies to inhibit TNF-α-mediated angiogenesis remain limited. METHODS: This study investigates the antiangiogenic effects of histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG), a multifunctional plasma protein with potent antiangiogenic properties, on TNF-α-stimulated human endothelial cells (EA.hy926). Tube formation assays were performed to assess angiogenesis, and gene/protein expression analyses were conducted to evaluate HRG's effects on integrins αV and β8. The role of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) in HRG-mediated antiangiogenic activity was also examined through nuclear translocation assays and NRF2 activation studies. RESULTS: At physiological concentrations, HRG effectively suppressed TNF-α-induced tube formation in vitro and downregulated TNF-α-induced expression of integrins αV and β8 at both the mRNA and protein levels. HRG treatment promoted NRF2 nuclear translocation in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, activation of NRF2 significantly reduced TNF-α-induced tube formation and integrin expression, suggesting that NRF2 plays a key role in HRG-mediated antiangiogenic effects. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that HRG suppresses TNF-α-induced angiogenesis by promoting NRF2 nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation, which in turn inhibits integrin αV and β8 expression. Given the essential role of angiogenesis in tumor progression, HRG's ability to regulate this process presents a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment."

      "abstract": "Increasing evidence has underscored the significance of post-stroke alterations along gut-brain axis, while its role in pathogenesis and treatment of ischemic stroke (IS) remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to elucidate the therapeutic effects and action targets of Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) on IS and explore a novel pathogenesis and treatment strategy of IS via profiling the microbial community and metabolic characteristics along gut-brain axis. Our findings revealed for the first time that the therapeutic effect of PNS on IS was microbiota-dependent. Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) modeling significantly down-regulated Lactobacilli in rats, and PNS markedly recovered Lactobacilli, particularly Lactobacillus reuteri (L.Reu). Metabolomics showed a significant reduction in serum histidine (HIS) in clinical obsolete IS patients and rehabilitation period I/R rats. Meanwhile, the L.Reu colonization in I/R rats exhibited significant neuroprotective activity and greatly increased HIS in serum, gut microbiota, and brain. Moreover, exogenous HIS demonstrated indirect neuroprotective effects through metabolizing to histamine. Notably, vagus nerve severance in I/R rats was performed to investigate HIS's neuroprotective mechanism. The results innovatively revealed that PNS could promote HIS synthesis in gut by enhancing L.Reu proportion, thereby increasing intracerebral HIS through peripheral pathway. Consequently, our data provided novel insights into HIS metabolism mediated by L.Reu in the pathogenesis and treatment of IS."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Histidine metabolism is crucial in role in tumor biology, contributing to tumor progression, immune regulation, and metabolic reprogramming. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), dysregulated histidine metabolism may promote tumor growth and immune evasion, although the specific mechanisms remain poorly understood. METHODS: Using single-cell RNA sequencing, the expression patterns of histidine metabolism-related genes were evaluated across different cell types in HCC samples. In vivo and in vitro experiments were conducted to validate how histidine treatment affects macrophage and T-cell function. Furthermore, the TCGA database was utilized to construct a prognostic model to identify the key gene BUD23 and to examine its correlation with metabolism and immune infiltration. RESULTS: The proportion of parenchymal cells exhibiting high histidine metabolism was significantly increased, accompanied by a general reduction in immune and stromal cell infiltration. Notably, macrophages and T cells demonstrated impaired antitumor functions. In the high histidine metabolism group, multiple critical cell communication pathways (e.g., MIF, CLEC, MHC II) were downregulated, macrophages shifted toward immunosuppressive subpopulations, T cells exhibited an exhaustion phenotype, and CD8 + T-cell activation was diminished. Further in vivo and in vitro co-culture experiments confirmed that elevated histidine concentrations promoted M2 polarization in macrophages and weakened T-cell cytotoxicity, accelerating tumor proliferation. According to TCGA analyses, BUD23 was upregulated in the high histidine metabolism group and significantly negatively correlated with patient survival and immune cell infiltration. Silencing BUD23 boosted immune cell activation and cytotoxic effects, effectively reversing the immunosuppressive microenvironment. A multivariable Cox regression-based prognostic model indicated unfavorable outcomes in patients with high histidine metabolism. CONCLUSION: Histidine metabolism drives tumor cell metabolic reprogramming and reshapes the tumor immune microenvironment through intercellular communication, thereby promoting tumor progression. BUD23 shows promise as a biomarker for prognosis and immune response prediction in liver cancer. This study provides new therapeutic targets and theoretical support for liver cancer treatment by targeting histidine metabolism.",

      "abstract": "rAj-HRP30 is a recombinant peptide derived from the wild-type rAj-HRP of Apostichopus japonicus through a gene-shortening mutation. It has a high histidine content (53.3% in its primary structure) and a molecular weight of 3.919 kDa, classifying it as a histidine-rich peptide. The literature reports indicate that human histidine-rich peptides exhibit antitumor activity. Previous research by our group demonstrated similar properties in rAj-HRP, the precursor of rAj-HRP30. Therefore, this study used Panc01 (human) and Panc02 (mouse) cells-highly malignant models with limited targeted therapies-to investigate the antitumor activity and mechanisms of rAj-HRP30 and evaluate its potential for pancreatic cancer treatment. This study designed a gene-shortening strategy for rAj-HRP and artificially synthesized the gene sequence of rAj-HRP30. The cDNA sequence of rAj-HRP30 was cloned into the pET23b vector, and the recombinant plasmid pET23b-HRP30 was transformed into E. coli BL21 for expression. Following IPTG induction, the recombinant peptide was purified using nickel ion affinity chromatography, yielding rAj-HRP30 with a purity exceeding 95%. rAj-HRP30 markedly inhibited the adhesion, migration, and invasion of Panc01 and Panc02 cells. It also disrupted cellular morphology and cytoskeletal structure while inducing apoptosis. These effects were dose-dependent. After confirming the in vitro anticancer activity of rAj-HRP30, this study employed Panc02 cells as a model to investigate its inhibitory mechanisms using Western blot analysis. The results revealed that rAj-HRP30 reduced FGFR1 expression in Panc02 cells and inhibited the downstream FYN and FAK signaling pathways, subsequently blocking the PI3K/AKT signaling and apoptosis pathways. In the apoptotic pathway, rAj-HRP30 was able to downregulate the expression of Bcl-2, Caspase-9, Caspase-3, Caspase-7, and PARP1 and upregulate the expression of Bax, cleaved Caspase-9, cleaved Caspase-3, cleaved Caspase-7, and cleaved-PARP1 to induce apoptosis in Panc02 cells. Furthermore, rAj-HRP30 also downregulated the expression of MMP2 and MMP9, thereby inhibiting the migration and invasion of Panc02 cells. Conclusion: rAj-HRP30 exhibits significant inhibitory effects on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Panc01 and Panc02 cells in vitro. Its mechanism involves FGFR1-related signaling and apoptosis pathways. rAj-HRP30 shows promise as a therapeutic agent targeting FGFR for pancreatic cancer.",

      "abstract": "Exploring the nature of histidine residue tautomerization via a systematic conformational study is essential for understanding the pathology and toxicity of several neurodegenerative diseases, as well as for their diagnosis and treatment. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to determine the Tau protein's histidine-containing dipeptide (Lys-His, His-Gln, and His-Val) and tripeptide (Lys-His-Gln and Lys-His-Val) isomeric conformations via intramolecular hydrogen bond interactions, with particular attention to the influence of N-H group isomeric forms on their properties. The calculated infrared (IR) spectroscopy of the N-H stretch region of each isomer and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shielding of the imidazole ring carbon atoms (13C1, 13C2, and 13C3) were investigated. The results show that both the IR spectrum of the N-H group and the NMR shielding of 13C nuclei on the imidazole ring can be used to identify the histidine-containing dipeptide and tripeptide tautomeric isomers. Systematically analyzing the hydrogen bonding interactions, the atomic charge distribution, the potential energy distribution, and the HOMO-LUMO transitions of each isomer further verified the above conclusions. This study provides theoretical evidence for the conformation identification of the histidine-containing dipeptide and tripeptide isomers on Tau protein.",

      "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) is an effective chemotherapy drug widely used against various cancers but is limited by severe cardiotoxicity. Mitochondria-lysosome interactions are crucial for cellular homeostasis. This study investigates the role of histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 2 (HINT2) in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC). We found that HINT2 expression was significantly upregulated in the hearts of DOX-treated mice. Cardiac-specific Hint2 knockout mice exhibited significantly worse cardiac dysfunction, impaired autophagic flux, and lysosomal dysfunction after DOX treatment. Mechanistically, HINT2 deficiency reduced oxidative phosphorylation complex I activity and disrupted the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD+/NADH ratio, impairing lysosomal function. Further, HINT2 deficiency suppressed sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 activity, downregulating transcription factor A mitochondrial, a critical regulator of complex I. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) supplementation restored lysosomal function in vitro, while cardiac-specific Hint2 overexpression using adeno-associated virus 9 or adenovirus alleviated DIC both in vivo and in vitro. These findings highlight HINT2 as a key cardioprotective factor that mitigates DIC by restoring the NAD+/NADH ratio, lysosomal function, and autophagy. Therapeutic strategies enhancing HINT2 expression or supplementing NMN may reduce cardiac damage and heart failure caused by DOX."

Umbelliferone (UMB) is known for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties, but its effects on cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced immunosuppression need further study. METHODS: We established a CTX-induced immunosuppressed mouse model and administered varying doses of UMB. Immune function was assessed by evaluating white blood cells, lymphocytes, thymus and spleen indices, and CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratios. Serum levels of IL-2, IFN-γ, IgA, IgM, and IgG, along with macrophage phagocytic activity, NK cytotoxicity, and lymphocyte proliferation, were measured. Untargeted metabolomics was used to identify key pathways regulated by UMB, and RT-qPCR and Western blotting were performed to analyze the expression of related enzymes and metabolites. RESULTS: UMB intervention increased white blood cells, lymphocytes, thymus and spleen indices, and CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratios in CTX-immunosuppressed mice. It reversed reduced levels of serum IL-2, IFN-γ, IgA, IgM, and IgG and improved macrophage phagocytic activity, NK cytotoxicity, and lymphocyte proliferation. Key pathways identified by metabolomics included histidine and purine metabolism. UMB improved levels of histamine, L-glutamate, L-aspartate, xanthine, dAMP, deoxyinosine, xanthosine, and cGMP and upregulated HDC, ASPA, and PNP while downregulating XDH, PDE5, ROS, and MDA in spleen tissue. UMB enhanced SOD activity and GSH levels and reduced apoptosis, as indicated by lower TUNEL-positive expression. CONCLUSION: UMB enhanced immune function in CTX-immunosuppressed mice through the regulation of histidine and purine metabolism, exhibiting antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects. These findings highlight the potential of UMB in mitigating immunosuppression.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common chronic and systemic autoimmune disease. Numerous clinical studies have indicated a correlation between alterations in gut microbiota and the onset and progression of RA. This research aims to restore intestinal microbiota to a healthy state through the oral administration of Bifidobacterium in the early stages with the goal of delaying the onset and progression of RA. METHODS: Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model was constructed to assess the development of RA using arthritis clinical scores, paw thickness, pathological analysis of knee joint. The immune response was evaluated by determinating specific antibodies and cytokines in serum and synovial fluid. The expression of intestinal barrier protein was analyzed by qPCR to evaluate the intestinal barrier function. Alterations in gut microbiota and metabolites were assessed by 16S rDNA and non-targeted metabolomics. RESULTS: The findings reveal that administering Bifidobacterium animalis BD400 orally led to a significant reduction in arthritis clinical scores and paw swelling thickness in CIA rats. Additionally, there was a decrease in osteo-facial fusion and calcified cartilage thickening in the knee joint. Furthermore, the oral administration of B. animalis BD400 resulted in the down-regulation of inflammatory factors TNF-α and collagenase MMP-13 in the knee joint. Levels of specific antibodies (anti-CII IgG, anti-CII IgG1, and anti-CII IgG2a) and cytokine IL-17A in serum, as well as cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β) in the synovial fluid of B. animalis BD400-treated CIA rats, were significantly reduced (p < 0.05). The gene expression levels of intestinal barrier proteins (occludin-1, MUC-2, and ZO-1) showed a significant increase (p < 0.05) in B. animalis BD400-treated CIA rats. The oral administration of B. animalis BD400 altered the composition of intestinal microorganisms in CIA rats at the phylum and genus levels, particularly affecting the genus HT002. B. animalis BD400 alleviates RA by down-regulating 1-methyl-L-histidine and urocanate in the histidine metabolism, laying a foundation for the RA prevention. CONCLUSION: By affecting genus HT002 and histidine metabolism in the gut microbiota of CIA rats, B. animalis BD400 restored intestinal permeability, inhibited systemic inflammatory response, and ultimately slowed down the development of RA.",

The role of H63D mutation in hemochromatosis is less clear, and its penetrance is low even in homozygotes. Therefore, iron overload in H63D heterozygotes is extremely rare and scarcely reported. We report the case of an asymptomatic Sinhalese man, previously unscreened, who was found to have elevated liver enzymes and hemoglobin in a routine medical check-up. His ferritin was 1272 (ng/ml) (22-322) with a transferrin saturation of 61% (15-50%). MRI of the abdomen for iron content revealed primary early iron deposition in the liver and pancreas with sparing of the spleen. Genetic studies detected H63D heterozygous homeostatic iron regulator (HFE) gene mutation with a normal C282Y gene. In his erythrocytosis workup, his erythropoietin level was suppressed. However, bone marrow biopsy did not reveal morphology suggestive of a clonal disorder, and he was negative for JAK2 V617F mutation, MPL gene, JAK2 exon 12 mutations, and calreticulin gene. He was diagnosed with H63D heterozygous hereditary hemochromatosis with iron overload and erythrocytosis and commenced on venesections as treatment for both conditions, with a good response. This case report highlights the rare possibility of developing clinically significant iron overload in H63D heterozygous hereditary hemochromatosis. Furthermore, several studies have reported the detection of HFE mutations in patients previously diagnosed with 'idiopathic' erythrocytosis. Hence, this case report calls attention to the need to suspect the presence of HFE gene mutations in patients with erythrocytosis with a negative workup for clonal red cell disorders."

      "abstract": "Soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) is a well-established pharmacological target for the treatment of acute angina pectoris, pulmonary hypertension and heart failure. Histidine 105 in the heme binding pocket of sGC is a crucial residue for heme binding and natural enzyme activation by NO. It was assumed that the heme-free sGC mutants α1/β1H105F and α1/β1H105A were valuable research tools for studying NO independent sGC activators. These mutants have been used in drug screening and animal models. We confirm that the first generation of sGC activators cinaciguat and BAY 60-2770 activate the α1/β1H105F and α1/β1H105A mutants. In contrast, we show that the second generation sGC activators runcaciguat and BAY 543 only activate heme-free sGC when the β1H105 residue is present. By testing runcaciguat in β1 H105F knock-in mice, we confirm this histidine-dependency in vivo. We propose a novel classification of sGC activators, distinguishing between the histidine-dependent activators runcaciguat and BAY 543 and the histidine-independent activators cinaciguat, BAY 60-2770 and BI703704. The histidine-dependency of some of the sGC activators provides a compelling rationale for a re-evaluation of previous research and drug development programs based on sGC histidine mutants. Whether the classification of sGC activators based on the activation mechanism also makes a therapeutic difference needs to be clarified in the future.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this experiment was to estimate the bioavailability (BA) of rumen-protected (RP) His, RPLys, and 2 RPMet products using 3 in vivo methods: area under the curve (AUC), plasma dose-response (PDR), and fecal free AA (FFAA) methods. We used 8 rumen-cannulated cows in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square experiment with 16-d periods. Treatments were (1) abomasal infusion of water (control), (2) abomasal infusion of free His, Lys, and Met (FAA), (3) administration of RPHis + RPLys + RPMet1 (rumen-protected methionine protected with ethyl cellulose; RPAA1), and (4) administration of RPHis + RPLys + RPMet2 (rumen-protected methionine protected with a pH-sensitive polymer; RPAA2). On d 7 of each experimental period, a pulse-dose of water (control) or FAA were infused into the abomasum of the cows, or RPAA were placed directly in the rumen, and blood samples were taken from the jugular vein through a catheter 11 times over a 24-h period for the AUC method. Following the AA pulse-dose, infusion lines were installed into the abomasum for continuous infusion of FAA for the PDR method, or RPAA were fed from d 12 to d 16 and cows were fitted with urinary catheters for total collection of feces for the FFAA method. Fecal collection and blood sampling were conducted from d 14 to 16. Due to technical issues likely leading to unrealistic BA estimates, data for the PDR method are reported in the supplemental material. Relative BA based on the AUC method (computed as AUC of RPAA treatment plasma AA concentration divided by AUC of FAA treatment plasma AA concentration) was lower for RPMet1 compared with RPMet2 (43% vs. 61%) and was 45% (SEM = 3.35) and 72% (SEM = 5.99), for RPHis and RPLys, respectively. Rumen escape fractions of RPAA, estimated in a previous study using an in situ method, and digestibility data from the current study were used for calculations of BA for the FFAA method. Bioavailability based on the FFAA method was lower for RPMet1 (67%) compared with RPMet2 (91%) and was 87% (SEM = 0.71) and 75% (SEM = 2.75) for RPHis and RPLys, respectively. The relative differences in estimated BA based on both the AUC and FFAA methods between the RPMet products were as expected, based on literature, and data for all 4 RPAA products corresponded well with previously estimated BA using the FFAA method. The unrealistic data for the PDR method were likely caused by technical deviations from the original method (e.g., once-daily dosing of RPAA and inability to capture representative plasma concentration data with the sampling time points). Therefore, comparison of the PDR method with the AUC and FFAA methods were not possible in this study. Further comparisons are needed without deviations from the original PDR method. Variability in BA data and differences in estimated BA between the in vivo methods highlight the current challenges for accurate measurements of relative in vivo BA of RPAA products. Different protection technologies may call for different methodology to be used for BA estimations. Further research and standardization of in vivo BA methods are warranted.",

This randomized multicenter active-controlled open-label trial aimed to verify the non-inferiority of NPC-25 to NOBELZIN™, zinc acetate dihydrate. METHODS: Participants whose serum zinc concentrations were <70 μg/dL at two points within 8 weeks before the start of treatment were randomized 1:1 into the NPC-25 (active drug) administration group and the NOBELZIN™ (control drug) administration group, using dynamic allocation. The initial daily doses were 50 mg or 100 mg as the baseline serum zinc levels, and administration periods were set at maximum of 24 weeks with the goal of maintaining the target serum zinc concentration (≥80 and <200 μg/dL) for 8 weeks, with extension up to 52 weeks as needed in the NPC-25 group, but not the NOBELZIN group. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants who maintained the target serum zinc concentration for 8 weeks at the same dosage within 24 weeks after the start of administration. The key secondary endpoints were the cumulative achievement percentage for target serum zinc concentration at each observation time point, the cumulative achievement percentage for maintenance of target concentration for 8 weeks at the same dosage at each observation time point, change in mean serum zinc concentration, and comparison of dosage amount. Safety assessments included the incidence of adverse events and adverse drug reactions, as well as changes in clinical laboratory and physical measurements. RESULTS: For the primary endpoint for full analysis (FAS) set (n=103, NPC-25 group; n=107, NOBELZIN group), the proportion of participants who maintained the target serum zinc concentration for 8 weeks at the same dose was 86.4 % (89/103) in the NPC-25 group and 80.4 % (86/107) in the NOBELZIN group, which confirmed the non-inferiority of NPC-25 to NOBELZIN™. For the secondary endpoint for FAS, at each observation point, although there was no significant difference between the two groups in the proportion of participants who achieved the target serum zinc concentration, there was a tendency that the maintenance of the target concentration for 8 weeks was achieved earlier with NPC-25. There was also a tendency to achieve maintenance with a lower daily dose in the NPC-25 group. Furthermore, at each observation point, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the mean serum zinc concentration or the average change in serum zinc concentration from baseline. In the safety assessment for safety population (SP), the incidence of nausea and vomiting was lower with NPC-25 than with NOBELZIN (2.8 % and 6.4 % with nausea, 0.9 % and 2.8 % with vomiting), but there were no significant differences in other adverse drug reactions. CONCLUSION: In this study, non-inferiority of NPC-25 to NOBELZIN™ was confirmed in terms of efficacy and safety. Furthermore, regarding safety, NPC-25 resulted in a lower frequency of digestive symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting.",

      "abstract": "Diagnostic escape via Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) histidine-rich protein 2 (pfhrp2) gene deletions is a major potential hurdle for global malaria elimination efforts. We investigated the prevalence of pfhrp2 gene deletions in 15 malaria-endemic villages in the state of Odisha, India, and modeled their impact on an ongoing in-country malaria intervention program. We found that 61.6% of subpatent P. falciparum infections (i.e., rapid diagnostic test [RDT]-negative and positive by polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) had pfhrp2 gene deletions, which were predominantly located in the exon 2 region (96.2%) and largely identified in samples from febrile individuals (82.6%). DNA sequencing and protein diversity features were characterized in a subset of samples from individuals with subpatent infections carrying intact pfhrp2 exon 2 loci. Our analyses revealed novel amino acid repeat motifs (231-293 amino acids), and these variant repeat sequences differed from those of RDT+/PCR+ samples. We also evaluated the state-sponsored mass screening and treatment intervention in the context of pfhrp2 gene deletions. We found that mass screening and treatment conducted alongside additional interventions (e.g., long-lasting insecticidal net distribution, indoor residual spraying) reduced the relative risk of infection for both P. falciparum parasites harboring a pfhrp2 deletion (adjusted relative risk ratio [aRRR] = 0.3; 95% CI = 0.1-1.0) and P. falciparum parasites with intact pfhrp2 genes (aRRR = 0.4; 95% CI = 0.2-1.1) when compared with the use of mass screening and treatment by RDT alone. Combined, our findings highlight the need for alternative diagnostic targets and tools as India moves toward its goal of malaria elimination by 2030.",

This study aimed to explore the effects of the chromium-histidine complex [Cr(hist)3] on reproductive success, developmental processes, and oxidative stress defence in Drosophila melanogaster. Wild-type D. melanogaster flies were exposed to Cr(hist)3 at concentrations of 5, 10, 15, and 20 µg/ml, and physiological parameters-including fecundity, fertility, developmental timelines, and antioxidant enzyme activity-were measured. Our results indicate that Cr(hist)3 at 15 µg/ml optimally enhanced reproductive health and developmental efficiency. Specifically, fecundity and fertility increased by 15.6% and 15.5%, respectively, and egg-to-adult viability improved by 15.6% compared to controls. Developmental timelines were shortened, with larval and pupal periods reduced by 7.6% and 7.1%. Additionally, Cr(hist)3 treatment led to a significant downregulation of lipid peroxidation (MDA) by 17.54% and upregulation in antioxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, and superoxide dismutase), indicating improved cellular defence against oxidative damage. Flies treated with 15 µg/ml Cr(hist)33 also exhibited a 9.7% increase in lifespan. These findings suggest that Cr(hist)3 enhances reproductive success and developmental dynamics through oxidative stress regulation, highlighting its potential for applications in insect health and stress management. This study contributes to the understanding of metal ion interactions in biological systems and their physiological effects.",

      "abstract": "Colon cancer is a common and lethal malignancy, ranking second in global cancer-related mortality, highlighting the urgent need for novel targeted therapies. The sea cucumber (Apostichopus japonicus) is a marine organism known for its medicinal properties. After conducting a bioinformatics analysis of the cDNA library of Apostichopus japonicus, we found and cloned a cDNA sequence encoding histidine-rich peptides, and the recombinant peptide was named rAj-HRP. Human histidine-rich peptides are known for their anti-cancer properties, raising questions as to whether rAj-HRP might exhibit similar effects. To investigate whether rAj-HRP can inhibit colon cancer, we used human colon cancer HCT116 cells as a model and studied the tumor suppressive activity in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that rAj-HRP inhibited HCT116 cell proliferation, migration, and adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in vitro. It also disrupted the cytoskeleton and induced apoptosis in these cells. In vivo, rAj-HRP significantly inhibited the growth of HCT116 tumors in BALB/c mice, reducing tumor volume and weight without affecting the body weight of the tumor-bearing mice. Western blot analysis showed that rAj-HRP inhibited HCT116 cell proliferation and induced apoptosis by upregulating BAX and promoting PARP zymogen degradation. Additionally, rAj-HRP inhibited HCT116 cell adhesion and migration by reducing MMP2 levels. Further research showed that rAj-HRP downregulated EGFR expression in HCT116 cells and inhibited key downstream molecules, including AKT, P-AKT, PLCγ, P38 MAPK, and c-Jun. In conclusion, rAj-HRP exhibits significant inhibitory effects on HCT116 cells in both in vitro and in vivo, primarily through the EGFR and apoptosis pathways. These findings suggest that rAj-HRP has the potential as a novel targeted therapy for colon cancer.",

Results show that dietary histidine is metabolized to ImP, with antibiotic-induced gut microbiota suppression reducing ImP levels in mice. In contrast, oral histidine supplementation resulted in increases in circulating ImP levels in humans, whereas antibiotic treatment increased ImP levels, which was associated with a bloom of several bacterial genera that have been associated with ImP production, such as Lactobacilli.

      "abstract": "Altering the mechanisms of tumor cell death and overcoming the limitations of traditional chemotherapy is pivotal to contemporary tumor treatment. Inducing ferroptosis, while circumventing safety concerns associated with ferrous vectors, through nonferrous ferroptosis is a promising but underexplored frontier in cancer therapy. Histidine phosphatase (LHPP) has emerged as a novel therapeutic target in treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the precise mechanism of LHPP against HCC remains unclear. Herein, we explore the effects of upregulating LHPP expression on ferroptosis and tumor immunogenicity induction by simply delivering a miRNA-363-5p inhibitor (miR-363-5pi) via a previously optimized gemcitabine-oleic acid (GOA) prodrug. Efficient miRNA encapsulation was achieved through hydrogen bonding at an optimized GOA/miRNA molar feed ratio of 250:1, affording spherical nanoparticles with a uniform hydrodynamic size of 147.1 nm and a negative potential of -21.5 mV. The mechanism of this LHPP-ferroptosis crosstalk is disclosed to be an inhibited phosphorylation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, leading to a remarkable tumor inhibition rate of 88.2% in nude mice bearing Bel-7402 tumor xenografts via a combination of LHPP-triggered nonferrous ferroptosis and GOA-induced chemotherapy. The biocompatibility of GOA/miR-363-5pi is strongly supported by their non-hematologic toxicity and insignificant organ damage. In addition, the tumor immunogenic activation potential of GOA/miR-363-5pi was finally explored. Overall, this study is the first work that elucidates the precise mechanism of LHPP for treating HCC via ferroptosis induction and achieves the transformation of chemotherapy and gene therapy into ferroptosis activation with tumor cell immunogenicity, which lays a new therapeutic foundation for the clinical treatment of HCC.",

      "abstract": "Anticancer therapies with cisplatin and volasertib (BI-6727) were monitored by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) in live SK-Mel-2 melanoma cells. A CdSe/ZnS quantum dot functionalized with a peptide containing D-penicillamine and histidine (CdSe/ZnS-PH) was used as intracellular pH fluorescent probe. A faster cytosol acidification was observed for cells treated with cisplatin when compared to volasertib. The first changes in the intracellular pH were found after 2 hours of treatment with cisplatin and 8 hours with volasertib. Additionally, the relationship between cytosol acidification and apoptosis was investigated using an innovative methodology based on time-resolved fluorescence measurements. Similar low percentages of apoptotic cells were observed after short incubation periods (2 - 8 hours) with both drugs. In contrast, late apoptosis and death were found for a large fraction of cells during 24-hour incubation with cisplatin but not volasertib. Thus, the early acidification observed in cisplatin treatment could accelerate apoptosis and cell death. Despite volasertib treatment shows slower mechanism of action than cisplatin, similar inhibitory effects were found for both drugs at longer incubation periods (72 hours). This study proves the potential of CdSe/ZnS-PH nanoparticle as a fluorescence lifetime probe in the study of the mechanism of action of antitumor drugs.",

      "abstract": "In areas where malaria is endemic and microscopes are unavailable, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are essential tools for early diagnosis and prompt and effective treatment. However, HRP2-based RDTs are threatened by the emergence of Plasmodium falciparum parasites that do not carry the pfhrp2 or pfhrp3 gene, leading to false-negative results. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the ParaHIT RDT together with the proportion of pfhrp2/3 gene-deleted P. falciparum parasites in Togo. The performance of RDTs compared with microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was determined using capillary blood collected by finger prick during a cross-sectional study conducted from September 2021 to January 2022 in children aged 6-59 months at two sentinel sites. Blood spots were collected for molecular analysis. Amplicons from the target regions (exon 2 of hrp2 and hrp3 genes) were generated by multiplex nested PCR and sequenced using Illumina's MiSeq protocol. A total of 278 samples were analyzed for ParaHIT RDT evaluation. The sensitivity and specificity of the RDT test compared with microscopy were 96.4% and 85.7%, respectively, which increased to 97.9% and 90.7%, respectively, when compared with PCR. Of the microscopically and PCR-positive P. falciparum samples, 138 were sequenced to detect pfhrp2/3 deletions. None of the parasites had a single pfhrp2 deletion or a single pfhrp3 deletion. The ParaHIT RDT demonstrated an acceptable level of performance in this evaluation, confirming the use of HRP2-based RDTs for the detection of P. falciparum infection in areas where microscopy is not available in Togo.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), which detect Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)-specific histidine-rich protein-2 (HRP2), have increasing importance for the diagnosis and control of malaria, especially also in regions where routine diagnosis by microscopy is not available. HRP2-based RDTs have a similar sensitivity to expert microscopy, but their reported low specificity can lead to high false positivity rates, particularly in high-endemic areas. Despite the widespread use of RDTs, models investigating the dynamics of HRP2 clearance following Pf treatment focus rather on short-term clearance of the protein. The goal of this observational cohort study was to determine the long-term kinetic of HRP2-levels in peripheral blood after treatment of uncomplicated malaria cases with Pf mono-infection using a 3-day course of artesunate/amodiaquine. HRP2 levels were quantified at enrollment and on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 17, 22, and 28 post-treatment initiation. The findings reveal an unexpectedly prolonged clearance of HRP2 after parasite clearance from capillary blood. Terminal HRP2 half-life was estimated to be 9 days after parasite clearance using a pharmacokinetic two-compartmental elimination model. These results provide evidence that HRP2 clearance has generally been underestimated, as the antigen remains detectable in capillary blood for up to 28 days following successful treatment, influencing RDT-based assessment following a malaria treatment for weeks. A better understanding of the HRP2 clearance dynamics is critical for guiding the diagnosis of malaria when relying on RDTs. IMPORTANCE: Detecting Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for the severest form of malaria, typically involves microscopy, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) targeting the histidine-rich protein 2 or 3 (HRP2/3). While microscopy and PCR quickly turn negative after the infection is cleared, HRP2 remains detectable for a prolonged period. The exact duration of HRP2 persistence had not been well defined. Our study in Gabon tracked HRP2 levels over 4 weeks, resulting in a new model for antigen clearance. We discovered that a two-compartment model accurately predicts HRP2 levels, revealing an initial rapid reduction followed by a much slower elimination phase that can take several weeks. These findings are crucial for interpreting RDT results, as lingering HRP2 can lead to false positives, impacting malaria diagnosis and treatment decisions.",

      "abstract": "Intravenous thrombolysis using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) remains the primary treatment for patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). However, the mechanism of tPA-related hemorrhagic transformation (HT) remains poorly understood. Elevation of histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) expression was detected by nano-liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry at 1 h following tPA infusion as compared to baseline prior to tPA infusion (discovery cohort, n = 10), which was subsequently confirmed in a validation cohort (n = 157) by ELISA. Surprisingly, no elevation of HRG was detected in individuals who subsequently developed HT. During in vitro experiments, HRG reduced neutrophil NETosis, inflammatory cytokine production, and migration across the blood-brain barrier induced by tPA. In a photothrombotic murine AIS model, HRG administration ameliorated HT with delayed thrombolysis, by inhibiting neutrophil immune infiltration and downregulating pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. Neutrophil depletion or NETosis inhibition also alleviated HT, whereas HRG siRNA treatment exacerbated HT. In conclusion, fluctuations in HRG levels may reflect tPA therapy and its associated HT. The inhibitory effect of HRG on neutrophils may counteract tPA-induced immune abnormalities and HT in patients with AIS.",

The number of neurons is determined by TH staining. mRNA expression is detected by RT-qPCR. Protein expression was detected by Western blot. Gene expression is determined by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. The functions of neurons are determined by TUNEL and flow cytometry assay. The binding sites of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) RELA on the promoter of NLRP3 are predicted by JASPAR and verified by luciferase and ChIP assays. The results showed that EA treatment improves motor dysfunction in patients with PD. In vivo assays show that MPTP administration induces the loss of neurons in mice, which is restored by EA treatment. Moreover, EA treatment alleviates motor deficits in MPTP-induced PD mice. EA treatment also inhibits the enrichment of pro-inflammatory cytokines and lactodehydrogenase and suppresses neuronal pyroptosis. EA treatment increases the expression of METTL9. However, METTL9 deficiency dampens the effects of EA treatment and induces neuronal pyroptosis. Additionally, METTL9 promotes histidine methylation of NF-κB RELA, resulting the inhibition of epigenetic transcription of NLRP3. EA treatment restores neuronal function and improves motor dysfunction via promoting METTL9 histidine methylation of NF-κB/ NLRP3 signaling.",

      "abstract": "Amino acids, metabolized by host cells as well as commensal gut bacteria, have signaling effects on host metabolism. Oral supplementation of the essential amino acid histidine has been shown to exert metabolic benefits. To investigate whether dietary histidine aids glycemic control, we performed a case-controlled parallel clinical intervention study in participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and healthy controls. Participants received oral histidine for seven weeks. After 2 weeks of histidine supplementation, the microbiome was depleted by antibiotics to determine the microbial contribution to histidine metabolism. We assessed glycemic control, immunophenotyping of peripheral blood mononucelar cells (PBMC), DNA methylation of PBMCs and fecal gut microbiota composition. Histidine improves several markers of glycemic control, including postprandial glucose levels with a concordant increase in the proportion of MAIT cells after two weeks of histidine supplementation. The increase in MAIT cells was associated with changes in gut microbial pathways such as riboflavin biosynthesis and epigenetic changes in the amino acid transporter SLC7A5. Associations between the microbiome and MAIT cells were replicated in the MetaCardis cohort. We propose a conceptual framework for how oral histidine may affect MAIT cells via altered gut microbiota composition and SLC7A5 expression in MAIT cells directly and thereby influencing glycemic control. Future studies should focus on the role of flavin biosynthesis intermediates and SLC7A5 modulation in MAIT cells to modulate glycemic control.",

This study investigated the association between HRG concentrations and these critical conditions. Methods: Blood samples were collected from 53 critically ill patients on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 after ICU admission at the Kyushu University Hospital. Daily clinical and laboratory data were recorded, and patient survival was assessed 28 days after ICU admission. Results: Serum HRG concentrations were significantly reduced on days 3, 5, and 7 in patients with septic shock and DIC but not in those with ARDS. While initial HRG levels on day one were not correlated with survival, nonsurvivors displayed decreased HRG levels, notably on days 3, 5, and 7 post-ICU admissions. The HRG levels remained stable in survivors. A progressive decrease was associated with higher mortality rates, particularly on days 5 and 7. On day 5, an HRG level with a cutoff of 25.5 μg/mL showed a sensitivity of 0.77 and a specificity of 0.75, indicating significantly lower survival rates (log-rank test, P < 0.05). Conclusion: HRG presents a potential intervention for critically ill sepsis patients, providing a novel strategy to enhance outcomes. Further research is needed to explore the therapeutic potential of HRG in sepsis management.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The upsurge of antimicrobial resistance demands innovative strategies to fight bacterial infections. With traditional antibiotics becoming less effective, anti-virulence agents or pathoblockers, arise as an alternative approach that seeks to disarm pathogens without affecting their viability, thereby reducing selective pressure for the emergence of resistance mechanisms. OBJECTIVES: To elucidate the mechanism of action of compound N'-(thiophen-2-ylmethylene)benzohydrazide (A16B1), a potent synthetic hydrazone inhibitor against the Salmonella PhoP/PhoQ system, essential for virulence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The measurement of the activity of PhoP/PhoQ-dependent and -independent reporter genes was used to evaluate the specificity of A16B1 to the PhoP regulon. Autokinase activity assays with either the native or truncated versions of PhoQ were used to dissect the A16B1 mechanism of action. The effect of A16B1 on Salmonella intramacrophage replication was assessed using the gentamicin protection assay. The checkerboard assay approach was used to analyse potentiation effects of colistin with the hydrazone. The Galleria mellonella infection model was chosen to evaluate A16B1 as an in vivo therapy against Salmonella. RESULTS: A16B1 repressed the Salmonella PhoP/PhoQ system activity, specifically targeting PhoQ within the second transmembrane region. A16B1 demonstrates synergy with the antimicrobial peptide colistin, reduces the intramacrophage proliferation of Salmonella without being cytotoxic and enhances the survival of G. mellonella larvae systemically infected with Salmonella. CONCLUSIONS: A16B1 selectively inhibits the activity of the Salmonella PhoP/PhoQ system through a novel inhibitory mechanism, representing a promising synthetic hydrazone compound with the potential to function as a Salmonella pathoblocker. This offers innovative prospects for combating Salmonella infections while mitigating the risk of antimicrobial resistance emergence.",

Particle size, zeta potential, turbidity, and solubility were used to evaluate protein aggregation, and the relationship between structural and functional changes of the proteins was characterized using spectral analysis, surface hydrophobicity, emulsification, and antioxidant properties. After ultrasound-assisted L-His treatment, SPI exhibited a smaller particle size, higher solubility, and more homogeneous micromorphology owing to the decrease in alpha-helix content and subsequent increases in zeta potential and active sulfhydryl content. In addition, spectral analysis showed that L-His and SPI could form a complex, which changed the microenvironment of the amino acid residues in SPI, thus improving its emulsification and antioxidant properties. At the concentration of L-His was 0.3 % w/w, the nanocomplex had a smaller particle size (140.03 nm), higher ζ-potential (-23.63 mV), and higher emulsification stability (22.48 min).",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Group III hybrid histidine kinases are fungal-specific proteins and part of the multistep phosphorelay, representing the initial part of the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway. TcsC, the corresponding kinase in Aspergillus fumigatus, was expected to be a cytosolic protein but is targeted to the nucleus. Activation of TcsC by the antifungal fludioxonil has lethal consequences for the fungus. The agent triggers a fast and TcsC-dependent activation of SakA and later on a redistribution of TcsC to the cytoplasm. High osmolarity also activates TcsC, which then exits the nucleus or concentrates in spot-like, intra-nuclear structures. The sequence corresponding to the N-terminal 208 amino acids of TcsC lacks detectable domains. Its loss renders TcsC cytosolic and non-responsive to hyperosmotic stress, but it has no impact on the antifungal activity of fludioxonil. A point mutation in one of the three putative nuclear localization sequences, which are present in the N-terminus, prevents the nuclear localization of TcsC, but not its ability to respond to hyperosmotic stress. Hence, this striking intracellular localization is no prerequisite for the role of TcsC in the adaptive response to hyperosmotic stress, instead, TcsC proteins that are present in the nuclei seem to modulate the cell wall composition of hyphae, which takes place in the absence of stress. The results of the present study underline that the spatiotemporal dynamics of the individual components of the multistep phosphorelay is a crucial feature of this unique signaling hub. IMPORTANCE: Signaling pathways enable pathogens, such as Aspergillus fumigatus, to respond to a changing environment. The TcsC protein is the major sensor of the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway of A. fumigatus and it is also the target of certain antifungals. Insights in its function are therefore relevant for the pathogenicity and new therapeutic treatment options. TcsC was expected to be cytoplasmic, but we detected it in the nucleus and showed that it translocates to the cytoplasm upon activation. We have identified the motif that guides TcsC to the nucleus. An exchange of a single amino acid in this motif prevents a nuclear localization, but this nuclear targeting is no prerequisite for the TcsC-mediated stress response. Loss of the N-terminal 208 amino acids prevents the nuclear localization and renders TcsC unable to respond to hyperosmotic stress demonstrating that this part of the protein is of crucial importance.",

The as-prepared SPSDVB-PAA-Cu with uniform size and nanoscale pore structure enabled coordination interaction of Cu2+ with histidine residues in his-rich proteins, resulting in high-performance adsorption.

Furthermore, the polymer microspheres were used to isolate histidine-rich proteins from human whole blood and plasma, underscoring their effectiveness. The liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) results indicated that the content of 14 most abundant proteins in human plasma was depleted from 81.6 % to 30.7 % and low-abundance proteins were enriched from 18.4 % to 69.3 % after treatment with SPSDVB-PAA-Cu, illustrating potential application of SPSDVB-PAA-Cu in proteomic research.",

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a randomized, active-controlled, open-label trial, 58 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to 10 mg/day empagliflozin (n = 29) or standard treatment without empagliflozin (control group, n = 29) and treated for 12 weeks. We obtained blood samples at baseline and 12 weeks and assessed the plasma amino acid profile by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry liquid chromatography. We also calculated the Fischer ratio (the ratio of branched-chain to aromatic amino acids). RESULTS: In the empagliflozin group but not in the control group, plasma levels of citrulline, histidine, and α-aminobutyric acid (AABA), the Fischer ratio, and serum high-molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin increased significantly (p = 0.0099, 0.0277, 0.0318, 0.0135, and 0.0304, respectively) and plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) decreased significantly (p = 0.0014). In the empagliflozin group, the change in plasma citrulline was positively correlated with the changes in HMW adiponectin (r = 0.488, p = 0.0084) and the Fischer ratio (r = 0.393, p = 0.0353) but negatively correlated with the change in ferritin (r= -0.533,p = 0.0051); the change in plasma histidine was negatively correlated with the change in PAI-1 (r= -0.398, p = 0.0397) and urinary albumin creatinine ratio (r= -0.478, p = 0.0088).

      "abstract": "Non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs), key to energy metabolism, may become pathogenic at elevated levels, potentially eliciting immune reactions. Our laboratory's findings of reduced L-histidine in ketotic states, induced by heightened NEFA concentrations, suggest an interrelation with NEFA metabolism. This observation necessitates further investigation into the mitigating role of L-histidine on the deleterious effects of NEFAs. Our study unveiled that elevated NEFA concentrations hinder the proliferation of Bovine Mammary Epithelial Cells (BMECs) and provoke inflammation in a dose-responsive manner. Delving into L-histidine's influence on BMECs, RNA sequencing revealed 2124 genes differentially expressed between control and L-histidine-treated cells, with notable enrichment in pathways linked to proliferation and immunity, such as cell cycle and TNF signaling pathways. Further analysis showed that L-histidine treatment positively correlated with an increase in EdU-555-positive cell rate and significantly suppressed IL-6 and IL-8 levels (p < 0.05) compared to controls. Crucially, concurrent treatment with high NEFA and L-histidine normalized the number of EdU-555-positive cells and cytokine expression to control levels. Investigating the underlying mechanisms, Gab2 (Grb2-associated binder 2) emerged as a central player; L-histidine notably reduced Gab2 expression, while NEFA had the opposite effect (p < 0.05). Gab2 overexpression escalated nitric oxide (NO) production and IL6 and IL8 expression. However, L-histidine addition to Gab2-overexpressing cells resulted in NO concentrations indistinguishable from controls. Our findings collectively indicate that L-histidine can counteract NEFA-induced inflammation in BMECs by inhibiting Gab2 expression, highlighting its therapeutic potential against NEFA-related metabolic disturbances.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many proteins with thiol groups can bind with trivalent arsenic which are termed as arsenic binding proteins, thus change their physiological functions. Therefore, it is vital to analyze the arsenic binding proteins in cells. The Pull-Down strategy based on biotinylated phenylarsenic acid (Bio-PAO(III)) probes is an effective way for analysis of arsenic binding proteins. In this strategy, streptavidin magnetic beads (SA-MBs) was applied to capture the arsenic binding proteins conjugating with Bio-PAO(III) probe. However, strong interaction between SA and biotin makes the elution of arsenic binding proteins not easy. RESULTS: We developed a novel affinity separation strategy to address the challenge of eluting arsenic binding proteins, a key issue with the existing Bio-PAO(III) Pull-Down method. By employing magnetic beads modified with Nα-Bis(carboxymethyl)-l-lysine (NTA-Lys), polyhistidine-tag (His6-Tag), and SA (MB-NTA(Ni)-His6-SA), we established a more efficient purification process. This innovative approach enables selective capture of arsenic binding proteins in HepG2 cells labeled by Bio-PAO(III) probes, facilitating gentle digestion by trypsin for precise identification through capillary high performance liquid chromatography (Cap HPLC)-electrospray ionization (ESI)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). What is more, the magnetic beads can be regenerated by using imidazole as the eluent, and the obtained MB-NTA(Ni) can be reloaded with His6-SA for next use. Our method successfully identified 41 arsenic binding proteins, including those involved in cytoskeletal structure, heat shock response, transcriptional regulation, DNA damage repair, redox state regulation, mitochondrial dehydrogenase function, and protein synthesis and structure. SIGNIFICANCE: This work contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the toxic mechanisms of arsenic, potentially providing valuable insights for the prevention or treatment of arsenic-related diseases.",

Our laboratory observed lower levels of L-histidine in cattle suffering from ketosis, indicating a potential interaction between L-histidine and NEFA metabolism. This relationship prompted us to investigate the metabolomic alterations in bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs) induced by elevated NEFA levels and to explore L-histidine's potential mitigating effects. Our untargeted metabolomic analysis revealed 893 and 160 metabolite changes in positive and negative models, respectively, with VIP scores greater than 1 and p-values below 0.05. Notable metabolites like 9,10-epoxy-12-octadecenoic acid were upregulated, while 9-Ethylguanine was downregulated. A pathway analysis suggested disruptions in fatty acid and steroid biosynthesis pathways. Furthermore, L-histidine treatment altered 61 metabolites in the positive model and 34 in the negative model, with implications for similar pathways affected by NEFA. Overlaying differential metabolites from both conditions uncovered a potential key mediator, 1-Linoleoylglycerophosphocholine, which was regulated in opposite directions by NEFA and L-histidine. Our study uncovered that both NEFA L- and histidine metabolomics analyses pinpoint similar lipid biosynthesis pathways, with 1-Linoleoylglycerophosphocholine emerging as a potential key metabolite mediating their interaction, a discovery that may offer insights for therapeutic strategies in metabolic diseases."

      "abstract": "Gray mold caused by Botrytis cinerea is among the 10 most serious fungal diseases worldwide. Fludioxonil is widely used to prevent and control gray mold due to its low toxicity and high efficiency; however, resistance caused by long-term use has become increasingly prominent. Therefore, exploring the resistance mechanism of fungicides provides a theoretical basis for delaying the occurrence of diseases and controlling gray mold. In this study, fludioxonil-resistant strains were obtained through indoor drug domestication, and the mutation sites were determined by sequencing. Strains obtained by site-directed mutagenesis were subjected to biological analysis, and the binding modes of fludioxonil and iprodione to Botrytis cinerea Bos1 BcBos1 were predicted by molecular docking. The results showed that F127S, I365S/N, F127S + I365N, and I376M mutations on the Bos1 protein led to a decrease in the binding energy between the drug and BcBos1. The A1259T mutation did not lead to a decrease in the binding energy, which was not the cause of drug resistance. The biological fitness of the fludioxonil- and point mutation-resistant strains decreased, and their growth rate, sporulation rate, and pathogenicity decreased significantly. The glycerol content of the sensitive strains was significantly lower than that of the resistant strains and increased significantly after treatment with 0.1 μg/ml of fludioxonil, whereas that of the resistant strains decreased. The osmotic sensitivity of the resistant strains was significantly lower than that of the sensitive strains. Positive cross-resistance was observed between fludioxonil and iprodione. These results will help to understand the resistance mechanism of fludioxonil in Botrytis cinerea more deeply.",

METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out at our center, with a total of 478 patients included in the analysis. Among them, 268 patients were administered the del Nido solution (DN) while 210 patients received the HTK solution. The primary focus of this study was to assess the occurrence of postoperative AKI and the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between the type of cardioplegia used and adverse kidney outcomes. Additionally, serum levels of sodium, potassium, and ionized calcium were monitored during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). RESULTS: The incidence of AKI was significantly higher in the HTK group compared to the DN group [(48/220 (21.81%) vs. 24/186 (12.90%), p = .049], although the rate of RRT did not show a statistically significant difference (9/48, 18.75% vs. 6/24, 25%, p = .538). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that HTK was a significant risk factor for AKI. Furthermore, serum sodium and calcium levels were found to decrease following HTK cardioplegic infusion. Conclusion: Our study provides compelling evidence of the impact of cardioplegic solutions on postoperative AKI rates. It underscores the importance of optimizing cardiac arrest protocols. These findings warrant further prospective investigations into the influence of cardioplegic solutions on electrolyte imbalances and postoperative AKI rates."

We enlisted a cohort comprising 207 symptomatic individuals, encompassing both children and adults, at a hospital in Nnewi, Nigeria. The prevalence of parasites was determined using a highly sensitive, species-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (SS-qPCR). Within a subset of 132 participants, we assessed the sensitivity and specificity of microscopy and HRP2-mRDTs in comparison to SS-qPCR for the detection of P. falciparum. We also investigated the prevalence of pfhrp2/pfhrp3 gene deletions. Greater sensitivity was achieved with mRDTs (95%) compared with microscopy (77%). Also, mRDTs exhibited greater specificity (68%) than microscopy (44%). The positive predictive value of mRDTs (89%) surpassed that of microscopy (80%), suggesting a greater probability of accurately indicating the presence of infection. The negative predictive value of mRDTs (82%) was far greater than microscopy (39%). Of the 165 P. falciparum-positive samples screened for pfhrp2/pfhrp3 gene deletions, one gene deletion was detected in one sample. Regarding infection prevalence, 84% were positive for Plasmodium spp. (by reverse transcription [RT]-qPCR), with P. falciparum responsible for the majority (97%) of positive cases. Thus, exclusive reliance on microscopy in endemic areas may impede control efforts resulting from false negatives, underscoring the necessity for enhanced training and advocating for high-throughput molecular testing such as RT-qPCR or qPCR at referral centers to address limitations.",

The 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) is the backbone of ALL combination chemotherapy, and resistance to it is crucially related to relapse. The present study couples chemoresistance in pediatric B-ALL with histidine metabolism deficiency. Evidence was provided that histidine supplementation significantly shifts the 6-MP dose-response in 6-MP-resistant B-ALL. It is revealed that increased tetrahydrofolate consumption via histidine catabolism partially explains the re-sensitization ability of histidine. More importantly, this work provides fresh insights into that desuccinylation mediated by SIRT5 is an indispensable and synergistic requirement for histidine combination therapy against 6-MP resistance, which is undisclosed previously and demonstrates a rational strategy to ameliorate chemoresistance and protect pediatric patients with B-ALL from disease progression or relapse.",

      "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic gram-negative pathogenic microorganism that poses a significant challenge in clinical treatment. Antibiotics exhibit limited efficacy against mature biofilm, culminating in an increase in the number of antibiotic-resistant strains. Therefore, novel strategies are essential to enhance the effectiveness of antibiotics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. D-histidine has been previously identified as a prospective anti-biofilm agent. However, limited attention has been directed towards its impact on Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Therefore, this study was undertaken to explore the effect of D-histidine on Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro. Our results demonstrated that D-histidine downregulated the mRNA expression of virulence and quorum sensing (QS)-associated genes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 without affecting bacterial growth. Swarming and swimming motility tests revealed that D-histidine significantly reduced the motility and pathogenicity of PAO1. Moreover, crystal violet staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated that D-histidine inhibited biofilm formation and triggered the disassembly of mature biofilms. Notably, D-histidine increased the susceptibility of PAO1 to amikacin compared to that in the amikacin-alone group. These findings underscore the efficacy of D-histidine in combating Pseudomonas aeruginosa by reducing biofilm formation and increasing biofilm disassembly. Moreover, the combination of amikacin and D-histidine induced a synergistic effect against Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms, suggesting the potential utility of D-histidine as a preventive strategy against biofilm-associated infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.",

However, the effect of anserine on the development of heart failure remains unknown. We cultured primary cardiomyocytes with 0.03 mM to 10 mM anserine and stimulated them with phenylephrine for 48 h. Anserine significantly suppressed the phenylephrine-induced increases in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, ANF and BNP mRNA levels, and histone H3K9 acetylation. An in vitro histone acetyltransferase (HAT) assay showed that anserine directly suppressed p300-HAT activity with an IC50 of 1.87 mM. Subsequently, 8-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and were randomly assigned to receive daily oral treatment with anserine-containing material, Marine Active® (60 or 200 mg/kg anserine) or vehicle for 8 weeks. Echocardiography revealed that anserine 200 mg/kg significantly prevented the TAC-induced increase in left ventricular posterior wall thickness and the decrease in left ventricular fractional shortening. Moreover, anserine significantly suppressed the TAC-induced acetylation of histone H3K9. These results indicate that anserine suppresses TAC-induced systolic dysfunction, at least in part, by inhibiting p300-HAT activity. Anserine may be used as a pharmacological agent for human heart failure therapy.",

      "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) envelope protein plays crucial role in virus entry and maturation of virus during infection. Maturation of DENV occurs in the trans Golgi network at slightly acidic pH which is close to pKa of histidine. When exposed to the acidic environment of the late secretory pathway, dengue virus particles go through a significant conformational change, whereby interactions of structural proteins envelope (E) and prM proteins are reorganised and enable furin protease to cleave prM resulting in mature virus. In order to study the role of histidine of E protein in DENV maturation, we mutated 7 conserved histidine residues of envelope protein and assessed the percent of budding using viral like particle (VLP) system. Histidine mutants; H144A, H244A, H261A and H282A severely disrupted VLP formation without any significant change in expression in cell and its oligomerization ability. Treatment with acidotropic amine reversed the defect for all 4 mutants suggesting that these histidines could be involved in maturation and release. Over expression of capsid protein slightly enhanced VLP release of H244A and H261A. Similarly, furin over expression increased VLP release of these mutants. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that prM and E interaction is lost for H244A, H261A and H282A mutants at acidic pH but not at neutral pH indicating that they could be involved in histidine switch during maturation at acidic pH. Detailed analysis of the mutants could provide novel insights on the interplay of envelop protein during maturation and aid in target for drug development.",

The current gold standard of risk stratifying sepsis patients provides limited mechanistic insight for therapeutic targeting.

Sepsis causes metabolic dysregulation in patients; therefore, metabolomics offers a promising tool to study sepsis. It is also known that that in sepsis endothelial cells affecting their function regarding blood clotting and vascular permeability. We integrated metabolomics data from patients admitted to an intensive care unit for sepsis, with commonly collected clinical features of their cases and two measures of endothelial function relevant to blood vessel function, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule and soluble thrombomodulin concentrations in plasma. We used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator penalized regression, and pathway enrichment analysis to identify features most able to predict 30-day survival. The features important to sepsis survival include carnitines, and amino acids. Endothelial proteins in plasma also predict 30-day mortality and the levels of these proteins also correlate with a somewhat overlapping set of metabolites. Overall metabolic dysregulation, particularly in endothelial cells, may be a contributory factor to sepsis response. By exploring sepsis metabolomics data in conjunction with clinical features and endothelial proteins we have gained a better understanding of sepsis risk factors.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is an important alternative strategy for patients with Crohn's disease (CD), and during this process, microbiota alterations have been observed. However, the underlying mechanisms by which EEN reduces intestinal inflammation are currently unclear. METHODS: The therapeutic potential of enteral nutrition (EN) was assessed using various mouse models. Fecal full-length 16S rDNA sequencing analysis and several CD metagenome datasets were used to identify the candidate therapeutic bacteria Faecalibaculum rodentium (F. rodentium). Whole genome sequencing of F. rodentium and widely-targeted metabolome analysis of the supernatant showed that EN-induced F. rodentium accumulation protected against colitis via histidine biosynthesis. FINDINGS: The therapeutic potential of EN therapy was observed in both dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and Il10-/- spontaneous colitis mouse models. Accumulation of F. rodentium after EN therapy was determined using full-length 16S rDNA sequencing and verified with several metagenome datasets from patients with CD. Colonization of an isolated F. rodentium could reduce colitis in Il10-/- mice. Significant histidine enrichment was observed in the F. rodentium culture supernatant, and a series of histidine biosynthesis genes were observed in the F. rodentium genome. Engineered Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), encoding the heterologous hisG of F. rodentium (EcN-hisG), which was a key driver of histidine biosynthesis in F. rodentium, was found to protect against colitis. INTERPRETATION: This study suggests that EN-induced F. rodentium accumulation protects against colitis in mice via gut bacteria-mediated histidine biosynthesis.

Esterases are used in many applications such as the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, leather, textile, paper, food, dairy products, detergents, and treatment of some environmental pollutants. RESULTS: A poly-histidine moiety was added to the C-terminal end of the Geobacillus sp. gene encoding carboxyl esterase (EstB, ac: KJ735452) to facilitate one-step purification. This recombinant protein was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) under control of Lambda promoter (λ). An open reading frame (ORF) of 1500 bps encoding a polypeptide of 499 amino acid residues and a calculated molecular weight (54.7 kD) was identified as carboxyl-esterase B due to its conserved glycine-X-serine-X-glycine motif (G-X-S-X-G) and its high similarity toward other carboxyl esterases, where the 3-D tertiary structure of EstB was determined based on high homology % (94.8) to Est55. The expression was scaled up using 7-L stirred tank bioreactor, where a maximum yield of enzyme was obtained after 3.5 h with SEA 51.76 U/mg protein. The expressed protein was purified until unity using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) charged with cobalt and then characterized. The purified enzyme was most active at pH 8.0 and remarkably stable at pH (8-10). Temperature optimum was recorded at 65 °C, and it kept 70% of its activity after 1-h exposure to 60 °C. The active half-live of enzyme was 25 min at 70 °C and a calculated T melting (Tm) at 70 °C. The determined reaction kinetics Michaelis-Menten constant (Km), maximum velocity rate (Vmax), the turnover number (Kcat), and catalytic efficiency (Kcat/Km) of the pure enzyme were found 22.756 mM, 164.47 U/ml (59.6 min-1), and (2.619 mol/ min), respectively. CONCLUSION: Creation of a recombinant 6 × -His estB derived from a thermophile Geobacillus sp. was performed successfully and then overexpressed under λ-promoter. In a bench scale bioreactor, the overexpression was grown up, followed by one-step purification and biochemical characterization. The recorded promising pH and temperature stability properties suggest that this expressed carboxyl esterase could be used in many industrial sectors."

Data in rodents and humans indicate that administration of exogenous carnosine improved cognitive performance. However, RCTs results vary. OBJECTIVES: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of histidine-containing dipeptide (HCD) supplementation on cognitive performance in humans to assess its utility as a cognitive stabiliser. DATA SOURCES: OVID Medline, Medline, EBM Reviews, Embase, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases from 1/1/1965 to 1/6/2022 for all RCT of HCDs were searched. DATA EXTRACTION: 2653 abstracts were screened, identifying 94 full-text articles which were assessed for eligibility. Ten articles reporting the use of HCD supplementation were meta-analysed. DATA ANALYSIS: The random effects model has been applied using the DerSimonian-Laird method. HCD treatment significantly increased performance on Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) -2 Delayed recall (Weighted mean difference (WMD) (95% CI (CI)) = 1.5 (0.6, 2.5), P < .01). Treatment with HCDs had no effect on Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (WMD (95% CI) = -0.2 (-1.1, 0.7), P = .65, I2 = 0%), Mini-Mental State Examination (WMD (95% CI) = 0.7 (-0.2, 1.5), P = .14, I2 = 42%), The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) Digit span Backward (WMD (95% CI) = 0.1 (-0.3, 0.5), P = .51, I2 = 0%), WAIS digit span Forward (WMD (95% CI) = 0.0 (-0.3, 0.4), P = .85, I2 = 33%) and the WMS-1 Immediate recall (WMD (95% CI) = .7 (-.2, 1.5), P = .11, I2 = 0%). The effect on delayed recall remained in subgroup meta-analysis performed on studies of patients without mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and in those without MCI where average age in the study was above 65. CONCLUSION: HCD, supplementation improved scores on the Delayed recall examination, a neuropsychological test affected early in Alzheimer's disease. Further studies are needed in people with early cognitive impairment with longer follow-up duration and standardization of carnosine doses to delineate the true effect.

      "abstract": "Hypoglycemia is a common adverse reaction to glucose-lowering treatment. Diabetes mellitus (DM) combined with recurrent nonsevere hypoglycemia (RH) can accelerate cognitive decline. Currently, the metabolic pattern changes in cognition-related brain regions caused by this combined effect of DM and RH (DR) remain unclear. In this study, we first characterized the metabolic profiles of the hippocampus in mice exposed to DR using non-targeted metabolomic platforms. Our results showed that DR induced a unique metabolic pattern in the hippocampus, and several significant differences in metabolite levels belonging to the histidine metabolism pathway were discovered. Based on these findings, in the follow-up experiment, we found that histidine treatment could attenuate the cognitive impairment and rescue the neuronal and synaptic damage induced by DR in the hippocampus, which are closely related to ameliorated mitochondrial injury. These ﬁndings provide new insights into the metabolic mechanisms of the hippocampus in the progression of DR, and l-histidine supplementation may be a potential metabolic therapy in the future.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mastitis poses a major threat to dairy farms globally; it results in reduced milk production, increased treatment costs, untimely compromised genetic potential, animal deaths, and economic losses. Streptococcus agalactiae is a highly virulent bacteria that cause mastitis. The administration of antibiotics for the treatment of this infection is not advised due to concerns about the emergence of antibiotic resistance and potential adverse effects on human health. Thus, there is a critical need to identify new therapeutic approaches to combat mastitis. One promising target for the development of antibacterial therapies is the transmembrane histidine kinase of bacteria, which plays a key role in signal transduction pathways, secretion systems, virulence, and antibiotic resistance. RESULTS: In this study, we aimed to identify novel natural compounds that can inhibit transmembrane histidine kinase. To achieve this goal, we conducted a virtual screening of 224,205 natural compounds, selecting the top ten based on their lowest binding energy and favorable protein-ligand interactions. Furthermore, molecular docking of eight selected antibiotics and five histidine kinase inhibitors with transmembrane histidine kinase was performed to evaluate the binding energy with respect to top-screened natural compounds. We also analyzed the ADMET properties of these compounds to assess their drug-likeness. The top two compounds (ZINC000085569031 and ZINC000257435291) and top-screened antibiotics (Tetracycline) that demonstrated a strong binding affinity were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations (100 ns), free energy landscape, and binding free energy calculations using the MM-PBSA method. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the selected natural compounds have the potential to serve as effective inhibitors of transmembrane histidine kinase and can be utilized for the development of novel antibacterial veterinary medicine for mastitis after further validation through clinical studies."

UV second derivative spectra and intrinsic Try fluorescence spectra revealed that L-His formed a complex with MP and altered the microenvironment of MP. After L-His-assisted ultrasound treatment, MP showed smaller particle size, higher solubility, and more uniform atomic force microscopy image due to the decrease of α-helix content and the subsequent increase in zeta potential, active sulfhydryl content, and surface hydrophobicity. Molecular docking and MD simulations demonstrated the optimal docking pose (minimum binding affinity of -6.78 kcal/mol) and revealed hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds as the main interaction forces between L-His and MP, with several residues (ILE-464, ILE-480, THR-483, ASN-484, GLY-466, ASP-463, PHE-246) identified as binding sites.",

The method was proved to be linear up to 100 μM histidine, with an LLOQ (lower limit of quantification) of 10 μM. The assay was only prone to interference from glutathione and histamine that exist in the urine samples at levels that are orders of magnitude lower compared to histidine.

Using novel monoclonal antibodies to detect pHis, we previously reported that the loss of the histidine phosphatase LHPP (phospholysine phosphohistidine inorganic pyrophosphate phosphatase) results in elevated pHis levels in hepatocellular carcinoma. Here, we show that intestinal inflammation correlates with the loss of LHPP in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated mice and in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Increased histidine phosphorylation was observed in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), as determined by pHis immunofluorescence staining of colon samples from a colitis mouse model. However, the ablation of Lhpp did not cause increased pHis or promote intestinal inflammation under physiological conditions or after DSS treatment. Our observations suggest that increased histidine phosphorylation plays a role in colitis, but the loss of LHPP is not sufficient to increase pHis or to cause inflammation in the intestine."

      "abstract": "The objective of this meta-analysis was to examine the effects of supplemental His on lactational performance, plasma His concentration and efficiency of utilization of digestible His (EffHis) in dairy cows. The meta-analysis was performed on data from 17 studies published in peer-reviewed journals between 1999 and 2022. Five publications reported data from 2 separate experiments, which were included in the analyses as separate studies, therefore resulting in a total of 22 studies. In 10 studies, His was supplemented as rumen-protected (RP) His; in 1 study, 2 basal diets with different dHis levels were fed; and in the remaining experiments, free His was infused into the abomasum (4 studies), the jugular vein (3 studies) or deleted from a mixture of postruminally infused AA (4 studies). The main forages in the diets were corn silage in 14 and grass silage in 8 studies. If not reported in the publications, the supplies of dietary CP, metabolizable protein (MP), net energy of lactation, and digestible His (dHis) were estimated using NRC (2001). An initial meta-analysis was performed to test the standard mean difference (SMD; raw mean difference of treatment and control means divided by the pooled standard deviation of the means), that is, effect size, and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) in production parameters between His-supplemented groups versus control. Further, regression analyses were also conducted to examine and compare the relationships between several response variables and dHis supply. Across studies, His supplementation increased plasma His concentration (SMD = 1.39; 95% CI: 1.17-1.61), as well as DMI (SMD = 0.240; 95% CI: 0.051-0.429) and milk yield (MY; SMD = 0.667; 95% CI: 0.468-0.866), respectively. Further, milk true protein concentration (MTP; SMD = 0.236; 95% CI: 0.046-0.425) and milk true protein yield (MTPY; SMD = 0.581; 95% CI: 0.387-0.776) were increased by His supplementation. Notably, the increase in MTP concentration and MTPY were 3.9 and 1.3 times greater for studies with MP-deficient (according to NRC 2001) diets compared with studies with MP-adequate diets. The regression analyses revealed that production parameters (DMI, MY, and MTPY) responded in a nonlinear manner to increasing His supply. Further, we detected a difference in the magnitude of change in MTPY and plasma His concentration with the level of His supply and between His supplementation methods, being greater for infused His compared with RPHis. Lastly, a linear and negative relationship between EffHis and the ratio of total digestible His to net energy for lactation supply was observed, indicating an important interaction between dHis and energy supply and EffHis (i.e., utilization of dHis to support protein export). Overall, these analyses confirm His as an important AA in dairy cattle nutrition.",

Herein, a nanomedicine strategy is presented to harness the surface roughness-controlled ceria nanocages (SRCNs) and poly(l-histidine) surface coatings for triggering multiple bioactive roles of intrinsically therapeutic nanocarriers and promoting transport across corneal epithelial barriers as well as achieving on-demand release of dual drugs [acetylcholine chloride (ACh) and SB431542] at the lesion site. Specifically, the high surface roughness helps improve cellular uptake and therapeutic activity of SRCNs while exerting a negligible impact on good ocular biocompatibility of the nanomaterials. Moreover, the high poly(l-histidine) coating amount can endow the SRCNs with an ≈24-fold enhancement in corneal penetration and an effective smart release of ACh and SB431542 in response to endogenous pH changes caused by tissue injury/inflammation. In a rat model of alkali burn, topical single-dose nanoformulation can efficaciously reduce corneal wound areas (19-fold improvement as compared to a marketed eye drops), attenuate ≈93% abnormal blood vessels, and restore corneal transparency to almost normal at 4 days post-administration, suggesting great promise for designing multifunctional metallic nanotherapeutics for ocular pharmacology and tissue regenerative medicine.",

The drug loading content was 21.0 % and the corresponding encapsulation efficiency was 66.6 %. The UV-vis and fluorescence spectra demonstrated the existence of the π-π stacking interaction between DOX and VCH. Drug release experiments implied good pH sensitivity and sustained-release effect. The DOX/VCH nanoparticles could be efficiently taken up by HepG2 cancer cells and the tumor inhibition rate was up to 56.27 %. The DOX/VCH reduced the tumor volume and weight efficiently with a TIR of 45.81 %. The histological analysis results showed that DOX/VCH could effectively inhibit tumor growth and proliferation, and there was no damage to normal organs. VCH nanocarriers could combine the advantages of VES, histidine and chitosan to achieve pH sensitivity and P-gp inhibition, and effectively improve the drug solubility, targeting and lysosomal escape. Through the program response of different micro-environment, the newly developed polymeric micelles could successfully be utilized as a multi-program responsive nanocarrier system for the treatment of cancers.",

      "abstract": "Pathogenic biofilm induced oral diseases have posed a significant treat to human health, such as periodontitis resulting from the formation of bacterial biofilm on teeth and gums. The traditional treatment methods such as mechanical debridement and antibiotic therapy encounter the poor therapeutic effect. Recently, numerous nanozymes with excellent antibacterial effect have been widely used in the treatment of oral diseases. In this study, a novel iron-based nanozyme (FeSN) generated by histidine-doped FeS2 with high peroxidase-like (POD-like) activity was designed for the oral biofilm removal and treatment of periodontitis. FeSN exhibited an extremely high POD-like activity, and enzymatic reaction kinetics and theoretical calculations had demonstrated its catalytic efficiency to be approximately 30 times than that of FeS2. The antibacterial experiments showed that FeSN had robust antibacterial activity against Fusobacterium nucleatum in the presence of H2O2, causing a reduction in the levels of glutathione reductase and ATP in bacterial cells, while increasing the level of oxidase coenzyme. The ultrahigh POD-like activity of FeSN allowed for easy detection of pathogenic biofilms and promoted the breakdown of biofilm structure. Furthermore, FeSN demonstrated excellent biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity to human fibroblast cells. In a rat model of periodontitis, FeSN exhibited significant therapeutic effects by reducing the extent of biofilm formation, inflammation, and alveolar bone loss. Taken together, our results suggested that FeSN, generated by self-assembly of two amino acids, represented a promising approach for biofilm removal and periodontitis treatment. This method has the potential to overcome the limitations of current treatments and provide an effective alternative for periodontitis treatment.",

Intracellular targets are hardly accessed, owing largely to the endosomal entrapment of internalized proteins/peptides. Here, we report a strategy to design and construct peptides that enable endosome-to-cytosol delivery based on an extension of the \"histidine switch\" principle. By substituting the Arg/Lys residues in cationic cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) with histidine, we obtained peptides with pH-dependent membrane-perturbation activity. These peptides do not randomly penetrate cells like CPPs, but imitate the endosomal escape of CPPs following cellular uptake. Working with one such 16-residue peptide (hsLMWP) with high endosomal escape capacity, we engineered modular fusion proteins and achieved antibody-targeted delivery of diverse protein cargoes-including the pro-apoptotic protein BID (BH3-interacting domain death agonist) and Cre recombinase-into the cytosol of multiple cancer cell types. After extensive in vitro testing, an in vivo analysis with xenograft mice ultimately demonstrated that a trastuzumab-hsLMWP-BID fusion conferred strong anti-tumor efficacy without apparent side effects. Notably, our fusion protein features a modular design, allowing flexible applications for any antibody/cargo combination of choice. Therefore, the potential applications extend throughout life science and biomedicine, including gene editing, cancer treatment, and immunotherapy.",

HmA not only shows high proteins loading efficiency, but also well retained proteins activity and protect proteins from protease damage. Within HmA, the biocatalytic activities of enzymes and the efficiency of the cascade reaction between GOx and CAT are enhanced, leading to a super response to the change of LBG with insulin release and efficient clearance of harmful byproducts of GOx (H2 O2 ). In the treatment of diabetic mice, HmA@GCI reduces LBG to normal in half an hour and maintains for more than 5 days by a single subcutaneous injection, and nearly 24 days with four consecutive injections. During the test period, no symptoms of hypoglycemia and toxicity to tissues and organs are observed.

Amino acid (AA) metabolism is aberrantly regulated in PC and circulating histidine (His) levels are low in PC patients. We hypothesized that His uptake and/or metabolism is dysregulated in PC and that combining His with gemcitabine (Gem), a drug used in the treatment of PC, will enhance the anti-cancer effects of Gem. We performed in vitro and in vivo studies to determine the anticancer effect of the combination of His and Gem against lethal PC. We demonstrate that circulating His levels are low in both human subjects and genetically engineered mice exhibiting pancreatic tumors. Interestingly, the expression of histidine ammonia lyase, an enzyme involved in His catabolism, is higher in PC compared to normal subjects. His + Gem exerts a more potent cytotoxic effect in PC cells compared to individual treatments. His treatment results in a profound increase in His accumulation, accompanied by a depletion of a number of AAs, promoting cancer cell survival and/or glutathione (GSH) synthesis. His but not Gem increases hydrogen peroxide and depletes cellular GSH. Supplementation with GSH protects cells against His + Gem-induced cytotoxicity. Further, our in vivo studies demonstrate that His + Gem potently reduced tumor mass and improved mouse survival. Taken together, our data suggest that PC cells exhibit an aberrant His uptake/accumulation which, in turn, leads to oxidative stress and depletion of AA pool, thereby enhancing the anticancer effect of Gem."

      "abstract": "Characterization of the conformational alterations involved in monomer misfolding is essential for elucidating the molecular basis of the initial stage of protein accumulation. Here, we report the first structural analyses of transthyretin (TTR) (26-57) fragments with two histidine tautomeric states (δ; Nδ1H and ε; Nε2H) using replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations. Explaining the organizational properties and misfolding procedure is challenging because the δ and ε configurations can occur in the free neutral state. REMD revealed that β-sheet generation is favored for the δδ (16.8%) and εδ (6.7%) tautomeric isomers, showing frequent main-chain contacts between the stable regions near the head (N-terminus) and central (middle) part compared to the εε (4.8%) and δε (2.8%) isomers. The presence of smaller and wider local energy minima may be related to the structural stability and toxicity of δδ/εδ and εε/δε. Histidines31 and 56 were the parts of regular (such as β-strand) and nonregular (such as coil) secondary structures within the highly toxic TTR isomer. For TTR amyloidosis, focusing on hazardous isomeric forms with high sheet contents may be a potent treatment strategy. Overall, our findings support the tautomerism concept and aid in our comprehension of the basic tautomeric actions of neutral histidine throughout the misfolding process.",

      "abstract": "Factor XII (FXII) knockdown attenuates catheter thrombosis in rabbits. Because histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) modulates FXIIa activity, we hypothesized that HRG depletion would promote catheter thrombosis. To test this, rabbits were given either antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) against HRG or FXII, a control ASO, or saline. The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), and catheter-induced thrombin generation were determined in blood collected before and after treatment. Compared with the controls, the HRG- and FXII-directed ASOs reduced hepatic messenger RNA and plasma levels of HRG and FXII, respectively, by >90%. Although HRG knockdown shortened the aPTT by 2.5 fold, FXII knockdown prolonged it by fourfold; neither of the ASOs affected the PT. Catheter segments shortened the lag time and increased peak thrombin in the plasma from control rabbits; effects were significantly enhanced and attenuated in the plasma from rabbits given the HRG- and FXII-directed ASOs, respectively. Catheters were then inserted into the right external jugular vein of the rabbits, and the time for catheter occlusion was determined. The catheter occlusion times with the control ASO or saline were 62 ± 8 minutes and 60 ± 11 minutes, respectively. The occlusion time was significantly reduced to 34 ± 9 minutes, with HRG knockdown and significantly prolonged to 128 ± 19 minutes with FXII knockdown. HRG levels are decreased with sepsis or cancer, and such patients are prone to catheter thrombosis. Because HRG modulates catheter thrombosis, our findings suggest that HRG supplementation may prevent this problem.",

This study assessed the frequency of pfhrp2- and pfhrp3-deleted strains at four different study sites in Central Africa (number of samples analyzed: Gabon N = 534 and the Republic of Congo N = 917) and West Africa (number of samples analyzed: Nigeria N = 466 and Benin N = 120) using a highly sensitive multiplex qPCR. We found low prevalences for pfhrp2 (1%, 0%, 0.03% and 0) and pfhrp3 single deletions (0%, 0%, 0.03% and 0%) at all study sites (Gabon, the Republic of Congo, Nigeria and Benin, respectively). Double-deleted P. falciparum were only found in Nigeria in 1.6% of all internally controlled samples. The results of this pilot investigation do not point towards a high risk for false-negative RDT results due to pfhrp2/pfhrp3 deletions in Central and West African regions. However, as this scenario can change rapidly, continuous monitoring is essential to ensure that RDTs remain a suitable tool for the malaria diagnostic strategy."

This form of genetic therapy has demonstrated a dose-dependent and highly selective reduction of P23H mutant rhodopsin mRNA in animal models, and it is currently being investigated as a human phase 1/2 clinical trial. SUMMARY: There are promising new therapies to treat adRP. ASON has shown encouraging results in animal models and has undergone a phase 1 clinical trial. ASON does not use a viral vector, is delivered with standard intravitreal injection, and its effects are reversible.",

      "abstract": "The quantitative profiling of residue reactivity in proteins promotes the discovery of covalent druggable targets for precise therapy. Histidine (His) residues, accounting for more than 20% of the active sites in enzymes, have not been systematically characterized for their reactivity, due to lack of labeling probes. Herein, we report a chemical proteomics platform for the site-specific quantitative analysis of His reactivity by combination of acrolein (ACR) labeling and reversible hydrazine chemistry enrichment. Based on this platform, in-depth characterization of His residues was conducted for the human proteome, in which the rich content of His residues (>8200) was quantified, including 317 His hyper-reactive residues. Intriguingly, it was observed that the hyper-reactive residues were less likely to be the sites for phosphorylation, and the possible mechanism of this antagonistic effect still needs to be evaluated in further research. Based on the first comprehensive map of His residue reactivity, many more residues could be adopted as the bindable sites to disrupt the activities of a diverse number of proteins; meanwhile, ACR derivatives could also be used as a novel reactive warhead in the development of covalent inhibitors.",

      "abstract": "Lowering the dietary protein content can reduce N excretions and NH3 emissions from manure and increase milk N efficiency of dairy cows. However, milk yield (MY) and composition can be compromised due to AA deficiency. Methionine and Lys are known as first limiting EAA for dairy cows, and recently His is also mentioned as limiting, especially in grass-based or low-protein diets. To examine this, a trial was conducted with a 3-wk pre-experimental adaptation period (diet 16.5% crude protein), followed by a depletion period of 4 wk, in which 39 cows (average ± standard deviation: 116 ± 29.3 d in milk, 1.8 ± 1.2 lactations, 638 ± 73.2 kg of body weight, and 32.7 ± 5.75 kg MY/d) received a low-protein diet (CTRL) (14.5% crude protein). Then, taking into account parity, His plasma concentration, and MY, cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups during the rumen-protected (RP) AA period of 7 wk; (1) CTRL; (2) CTRL + RP-Met + RP-Lys (MetLys); (3) CTRL + RP-Met + RP-Lys + RP-His (MetLysHis). Products were dosed, assuming requirements for digestible (d) Met, dLys, and dHis being, respectively, 2.4%, 7.0%, and 2.4% of intestinal digestible protein. In the cross-back period of 5 wk, all cows received the CTRL diet. During the last week of each period, a N balance was conducted by collecting total urine and spot samples of feces. Total feces production was calculated using the inert marker TiO2. Statistical analysis was performed with a linear mixed model with cow as random effect and data of the last week of the pre-experimental period used as covariate for the animal performance variables. No effect of supplementing RP-Met and RP-Lys nor RP-Met, RP-Lys, and RP-His on feed intake, milk performance, or milk N efficiency was observed. However, the plasma AA profile indicated additional supply of dMet, dLys, and dHis. Nevertheless, evaluation of the AA uptake relative to the cow's requirements showed that most EAA (exclusive Arg and Thr) were limiting over the whole experiment. Only dHis was sufficiently supplemented during the RP-AA period due to an overestimation of the diet's dMet and dLys supply in the beginning of the trial. The numerically increased milk urea N and urinary N excretion when RP-Met, RP-Lys, and RP-His were added to the low-protein diet suggest an increased catabolism of the excess His.",

The application of appropriate electric fields (EFs) can be a potential noninvasive therapy to treat neuro disorders. The effect of EFs of varying intensities and directions on the conformational dynamics of β-Amyloid40 (Aβ40) under histidine tautomerism has been investigated for the first time. Our findings suggest that peptides tend to align their dipole moments with the orientation of EF. Irrespective of the EF direction, the dipole moment magnitude is affected by the EF strength. With the conformational changes, the EF strength equal to 0.5 V/nm destroyed the β-sheet content of the δδδ isomer as a potentially toxic agent. The content of the alpha-helical structure which can be transformed into the β-sheet is reduced. The strength of the EF showed a significant influence on the reduction of the number of intra-protein hydrogen bonds especially when EF is equal to 0.5 V/nm which could facilitate destabilization of the structure of the peptides. Current findings provide quantitative insights into the tautomerization-mediated Aβ40 dynamic and conformational changes induced by the external EFs in aqueous solutions, which may provide beneficial information for use as a therapeutic technique.",

      "abstract": "Globally, urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most frequent bacterial infections. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) are the predominant etiological agents causing community and healthcare-associated UTIs. Biofilm formation is an important pathogenetic mechanism of UPEC responsible for chronic and recurrent infections. The development of high levels of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among UPEC has complicated therapeutic management. Newer antimicrobial agents are needed to tackle the increasing trend of AMR and inhibit biofilms. Heraclenol is a natural furocoumarin compound that inhibits histidine biosynthesis selectively. In this study, for the first time, we have demonstrated the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity of heraclenol against UPEC. The drug reduced the bacterial load in the murine catheter UTI model by ≥4 logs. The drug effectively reduced bacterial loads in kidney, bladder, and urine samples. On histopathological examination, heraclenol treatment showed a reversal of inflammatory changes in the bladder and kidney tissues. It reduced the biofilm formation by 70%. The MIC value of heraclenol was observed to be high (1024 µg/mL), though the drug at MIC concentration did not have significant cytotoxicity on the Vero cell line. Further molecular docking revealed that heraclenol binds to the active site of the HisC, thereby preventing its activation by native substrate, which might be responsible for its antibacterial and antibiofilm activity. Since the high MIC of heraclenol is not achievable clinically in human tissues, further chemical modifications will be required to lower the drug's MIC value and increase its potency. Alternatively, its synergistic action with other antimicrobials may also be studied."

      "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is currently regarded as a promising method for the treatment of oncological diseases. However, it involves a number of limitations related to the specific features of the method and the specific characteristics of photosensitizer molecules, including tumor hypoxia, small depth of light penetration into the tumor tissue, and low accumulation sensitivity. These drawbacks can be overcome by combining PDT with other treatment methods, for example, chemotherapy. In this work, we were the first to obtain agents that contain bacteriopurpurinimide as a photodynamic subunit and complexes of gold(I) that implement the chemotherapy effect. To bind the latter agents, N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) based on histidine and histamine were obtained. We considered alternative techniques for synthesizing the target conjugates and selected an optimal one that enabled the production of preparative amounts for biological assays. In vitro studies showed that all the compounds obtained exhibited high photoinduced activity. The C-donor Au(I) complexes exhibited the maximum specific activity at longer incubation times compared to the other derivatives, both under exposure to light and without irradiation. In in vivo studies, the presence of histamine in the NHC-derivative of dipropoxy-BPI (7b) had no significant effect on its antitumor action, whereas the Au(I) metal complex of histamine NHC-derivative with BPI (8b) resulted in enhanced antitumor activity and in an increased number of remissions after photodynamic treatment.",

      "abstract": "(1) Background: Malaria control has strongly benefited from the implementation of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). The malaria RDTs used in Burkina Faso, as per the recommendation of the National Malaria Control Program, are based on the detection of histidine-rich protein-2 (PfHRP2) specific to Plasmodium falciparum, which is the principal plasmodial species causing malaria in Burkina Faso. However, there is increasing concern about the diagnostic performance of these RDTs in field situations, and so constant monitoring of their accuracy is warranted. (2) Methods: A prospective study was performed in the health district of Nanoro, where 391 febrile children under 5 years with an axillary temperature ≥37.5 °C presenting at participating health facilities were subjected to testing for malaria. The HRP2-based RDT and expert microscopy were used to determine the diagnostic performance of the former. Retrospectively, the correctness of the antimalaria prescriptions was reviewed. (3) Results: Taking expert malaria microscopy as the gold standard, the sensitivity of the employed RDT was 98.5% and the specificity 40.5%, with a moderate agreement between the RDT testing and microscopy. In total, 21.7% of cases received an inappropriate antimalarial treatment based on a retrospective assessment with expert microscopy results. (4) Conclusion: Malaria remains one of the principal causes of febrile illness in Burkina Faso. Testing with HRP2-based RDTs is inaccurate, in particular, due to the low specificity, which results in an over-prescription of antimalarials, with emerging antimalarial drug resistance as an important risk and many children not being treated for potential other causes of fever."

      "abstract": "Soil salinization is an important worldwide environmental problem and the main reason to reduce agricultural productivity. Recent findings suggested that histidine is a crucial residue that influences the ROS reduction and improves the plants' tolerance to salt stress. Herein, we conducted experiments to understand the underlying regulatory effects of histidine on maize root system under salt stress (100 mM NaCl solution system). Several antioxidant enzymes were determined. The related expressed genes (DEGs) with its pathways were observed by Transcriptome technologies. The results of the present study confirmed that histidine can ameliorate the adverse effects of salt stress on maize root growth. When the maize roots exposed to 100 mM NaCl were treated with histidine, the accumulation of superoxide anion radicals, hydrogen peroxide, and malondialdehyde, and the content of nitrate nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen were significantly reduced; while the activities of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase, and glutamate synthase were significantly increased. Transcriptome analysis revealed that a total of 454 (65 up-regulated and 389 down-regulated) and 348 (293 up-regulated and 55 down-regulated) DEGs were observed when the roots under salt stress were treated with histidine for 12 h and 24 h, respectively. The pathways analysis of those DEGs showed that a small number of down-regulated genes were enriched in phytohormone signaling and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis at 12 h after histidine treatment, and the DEGs involved in the phytohormone signaling, glycolysis, and nitrogen metabolism were significantly enriched at 24 h after treatment. These results of gene expression and enzyme activities suggested that histidine can improve the salt tolerance of maize roots by enriching some DEGs involved in plant hormone signal transduction, glycolysis, and nitrogen metabolism pathways."

      "abstract": "Malaria remains a major public health challenge worldwide. In order to ensure a prompt and accurate malaria diagnosis, the World Health Organization recommended the confirmatory parasitological diagnosis of malaria by microscopy and malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) prior to antimalarial administration and treatment. This study was designed to evaluate the performance of nested polymerase chain reaction (nested PCR), light microscopy, and Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 rapid diagnostic test (PfHRP2 RDT) in the detection of falciparum malaria in Akure, Nigeria. A cross-sectional and hospital-based study involving 601 febrile volunteer participants was conducted in Akure, Nigeria. Approximately 2-3 mL venous blood samples were obtained from each study participant for parasitological confirmation by microscopy and PfHRP2-based malaria RDT. Thick and thin films were prepared and viewed under the light microscope for parasite detection, parasite density quantification, and species identification, respectively. Dry blood spot samples were prepared on 3MM Whatman filter paper for nested PCR. The overall prevalence of microscopy, PfHRP2 RDT, and nested PCR were 64.89% (390/601), 65.7% (395/601), and 67.39% (405/601), respectively. The estimates of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, accuracy, and Youden's j index of microscopy and RDT were 96.30, 100.00, 100.00, 92.89, 97.50, 0.963, and 95.06, 94.90, 97.47, 90.29, 95.01, and 0.899, respectively. Malaria RDT recorded higher false negativity, compared microscopy (4.94% vs. 3.70%). A near perfect agreement was reported between microscopy and nested PCR, and between PfHRP2 RDT and nested PCR with Cohen's kappa (k) values of 0.94 and 0.88, respectively. This study revealed that PfHRP2 RDT and microscopy continues to remain sensitive and specific for falciparum malaria diagnosis in the study area."

      "abstract": "The carnosine and anserine, which represent histidine dipeptides (HD), are abundant in chicken broth (CB). HD are endogenous dipeptide that has excellent antioxidant and immunomodulatory effects. The immunomodulatory effect of CB hydrolysate (CBH) and HD in cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced immunosuppressed mice was examined in this study. CBH and HD were given to mice via oral gavage for 15 days, accompanied by intraperitoneal CTX administration to induce immunosuppression. CBH and HD treatment were observed to reduce immune organ atrophy (p < 0.05) and stimulate the proliferation of splenic lymphocytes (p < 0.05) while improving white blood cell, immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgG, and IgA levels (p < 0.05). Moreover, CBH and HD strongly stimulated interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production by up-regulating IL-2 and IFN-γ mRNA expression (p < 0.05) while inhibiting interleukin-10 (IL-10) overproduction and IL-10 mRNA expression (p < 0.05). In addition, CBH and HD prevented the inhibition of the nitric oxide (NP)/cyclic guanosine monophosphate-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cGMP-cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway (p < 0.05). These results indicate that CBH and HD have the potential to prevent immunosuppression induced by CTX. Our data demonstrate that CBH can effectively improve the immune capacity of immunosuppressed mice similar to the same amount of purified HD, which indicates that CBH plays its role through its own HD.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, nanomaterials are increasingly being used as drug carriers in the treatment of different types of cancers. As a result, these applications make them attractive to researchers dealing with diagnosis and biomarkers discovery of the disease. In this study, the adsorption behavior of gemcitabine (GMC) on graphene nanosheet (GNS), in the presence and absence of Poly (L-histidine) (PLH) polymer is discussed using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The MD results revealed an increase in the efficiency and targeting of the drug when the polymer is covalently attached to the graphene substrate. In addition, the metadynamics simulation to investigate the effects of PLH on the adsorption capacity of the GNS, and explore the adsorption/desorption process of GMC on pristine and PLH- grafted GNS is performed. The metadynamics calculations showed that the amount of free energy of the drug in acidic conditions is higher (- 281.26 kJ/mol) than the free energy in neutral conditions (- 346.24 kJ/mol). Consequently, the PLH polymer may not only help drug adsorption but can also help in drug desorption in lower pH environments. Based on these findings, it can be said that covalent polymer bonding not only can help in the formation of a targeted drug delivery system but also can increase the adsorption capacity of the substrate.",

The mechanisms of action are diverse, including inhibition of immune thrombus formation and inhibition of ROS production. In addition, HRG has been shown to neutralize the toxicity of heme, a type of DAMPs, and neutralize the activity of LPS, a type of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and to inhibit the translocation of HMGB1 from the nucleus of vascular endothelial cells to the extracellular space. Since DAMPs/PAMPs are known to play a central role in the pathogenesis of not only sepsis but also many inflammatory diseases, HRG has wide therapeutic applications and is considered to be a very promising seed for drug discovery.",

The abilities of histidine ammonia lyases from different extremophiles to preserve their catalytic activities after exposure to acid were assessed. Thermoplasma acidophilum histidine ammonia lyase was identified as an enzyme with a promising catalytic profile following acid treatment. The fusion of this enzyme with the maltose-binding protein or co-incubation with the chaperone HdeA further helped Thermoplasma acidophilum histidine ammonia lyase to withstand acid treatments down to pH 2.8. The assembly of a microreactor by encapsulation of MBP-Thermoplasma acidophilum histidine ammonia lyase into a photocrosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogel allowed the enzyme to recover over 50% of its enzymatic activity following exposure to simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. Our results show that using engineered proteins obtained from extremophiles in combination with polymer-based encapsulation can advance the oral formulations of biologicals."

      "abstract": "Among natural products, ovothiol (ovo), produced by marine invertebrates, bacteria, and microalgae, is receiving increasing interest for its unique antioxidant properties. Recently, ovo has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity in an in vitro model of endothelial dysfunction and in an in vivo model of liver fibrosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ovo and its precursor 5-thiohistidine (5-thio) in comparison with ergothioneine (erg), in human skin cells and tissues upon inflammation. We used both an in vitro and ex vivo model of human skin, represented by a keratinocytes cell line (HaCaT) and skin biopsies, respectively. We observed that ovo, 5-thio, and erg were not cytotoxic in HaCaT cells, but instead exerted a protective function against TNF-α -induced inflammation. In order to get insights on their mechanism of action, we performed western blot analysis of ERK and JNK, as well as sub-cellular localization of Nrf2, a key mediator of the anti-inflammatory response. The results indicated that the pre-treatment with ovo, 5-thio, and erg differently affected the phosphorylation of ERK and JNK. However, all the three molecules promoted the accumulation of Nrf2 in the nucleus of HaCaT cells. In addition, gene expression analysis by RTqPCR and ELISA assays performed in ex vivo human skin tissues pre-treated with thiohistidines and then inflamed with IL-1β revealed a significant downregulation of IL-8, TNF-α and COX-2 genes and a concomitant significant decrease in the cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α production. Moreover, the protective action of ovo and 5-thio resulted to be stronger when compared with dexamethasone, a corticosteroid drug currently used to treat skin inflammatory conditions. Our findings suggest that ovo and 5-thio can ameliorate skin damage and may be used to develop natural skin care products to prevent the inflammatory status induced by environmental stressors and aging.",

In histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HARS), autosomal dominant mutations V133F, V155G, Y330C and S356N in the HARS catalytic domain cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 W (CMT2W), while tRNA-binding domain mutation Y454S causes recessive Usher syndrome type IIIB. In a yeast model, all human HARS variants complemented a genomic deletion of the yeast ortholog HTS1 at high expression levels. CMT2W associated mutations, but not Y454S, resulted in reduced growth. We show mistranslation of histidine to glutamine and threonine in V155G and S356N but not Y330C mutants in yeast. Mistranslating V155G and S356N mutants lead to accumulation of insoluble proteins, which was rescued by histidine. Mutants V133F and Y330C showed the most significant growth defect and decreased HARS abundance in cells. Here, histidine supplementation led to insoluble protein aggregation and further reduced viability, indicating histidine toxicity associated with these mutants. V133F proteins displayed reduced thermal stability in vitro, which was rescued by tRNA. Our data will inform future treatment options for HARS patients, where histidine supplementation may either have a toxic or compensating effect depending on the nature of the causative HARS variant.",

Plasmodium falciparum histidine rich protein 2 (PFHRP2) is the most targeted antigen for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum infections by rapid diagnostic card test. Genetic mutations and gene deletions are important emerging factors for false-negative RDTs, which may delay the provision of life-saving treatment for the patients. Hence, we would like to evaluate for the existence of pfhrp2/3 gene deleted P. falciparum parasites in our health care setting. This study was conducted for a period of 2 years in a tertiary care centre in South India. Blood samples that are microscopically confirmed as P. falciparum but negative by RDT were assessed for the presence of pfhrp2, pfhrp3, and their flanking genes using conventional PCR. Follow up of the clinical outcomes were also done for these patients. Of the 63 positive samples collected (50 /63) 79.4% were P.vivax and (13/63) 20.6% were P.falciparum by PCR. Among the 13 P. falciparum positive samples, 4 samples (4/13), (95% CI -10.36% to 61.11%) were found to be RDT negative but microscopically positive.Pfhrp2,pfhrp3 and their flanking genes were amplified for these 4 samples. All 4 samples were found to be negative for both pfhrp2-2 & pfhrp2-3 exon regions and also varying patterns of flanking gene deletions were also noted.This study provides molecular evidence for the existence of pfhrp2 & pfhrp3 deleted P. falciparum parasites in a tertiary care centre in South India warranting periodic evaluation of pfhrp2 based RDT use. Only pfhrp2/3 RDT based decision on diagnosis of P.falciparum malaria should always be reconsidered especially in remote areas."

      "abstract": "Low-protein (LP) diets are associated with a decreased risk of diabetes in humans, and promote leanness and glycaemic control in both rodents and humans. While the effects of an LP diet on glycaemic control are mediated by reduced levels of the branched-chain amino acids, we have observed that reducing dietary levels of the other six essential amino acids leads to changes in body composition. Here, we find that dietary histidine plays a key role in the response to an LP diet in male C57BL/6J mice. Specifically reducing dietary levels of histidine by 67% reduces the weight gain of young, lean male mice, reducing both adipose and lean mass without altering glucose metabolism, and rapidly reverses diet-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis in diet-induced obese male mice, increasing insulin sensitivity. This normalization of metabolic health was associated not with caloric restriction or increased activity, but with increased energy expenditure. Surprisingly, the effects of histidine restriction do not require the energy balance hormone Fgf21. Histidine restriction that was started in midlife promoted leanness and glucose tolerance in aged males but not females, but did not affect frailty or lifespan in either sex. Finally, we demonstrate that variation in dietary histidine levels helps to explain body mass index differences in humans. Overall, our findings demonstrate that dietary histidine is a key regulator of weight and body composition in male mice and in humans, and suggest that reducing dietary histidine may be a translatable option for the treatment of obesity. KEY POINTS: Protein restriction (PR) promotes metabolic health in rodents and humans and extends rodent lifespan. Restriction of specific individual essential amino acids can recapitulate the benefits of PR. Reduced histidine promotes leanness and increased energy expenditure in male mice. Reduced histidine does not extend the lifespan of mice when begun in midlife. Dietary levels of histidine are positively associated with body mass index in humans.",

Before concurrent chemoradiotherapy, compared with healthy controls, the cancer group showed lower levels of histidine, leucine, and phenylalanine and had low values in anthropometric and body composition measurements; however, the group displayed higher ornithine levels, more malnutrition, and severe inflammation. Pretreatment advanced Glasgow prognostic score (1 and 2) status was the sole prognostic factor for 3-year mortality rate and was associated with age and serum histidine levels in patients with cancer. Thus, even at the same tumor stage and ECOG PS, patients with LAHNSCC, poor nutrition, and high inflammation severity at baseline may have inferior survival outcomes than those with adequate nutrition and low inflammation severity.

Radical orchiectomy is the standard therapy in children and adults, although it entails physical and psychosocial side effects. Testis-sparing surgery can be a consideration for benign LCT of 2.5 cm or less in size. Malignant LCTs respond poorly to conventional chemotherapy, so new treatment modalities are needed. In this study, we observed increased histidine decarboxylase expression and pro-angiogenic potential in LCT surgically resected from pediatric patients (fetal to pubertal) vs control samples from patients without endocrine or metabolic disorders which were collected at necropsy. We, therefore, evaluated for the first time the antitumor efficacy of two histidine decarboxylase inhibitors (α-methyl-dl-histidine dihydrochloride (α-MHD) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)), alone and combined with carboplatin, in two preclinical models of LCT. MA-10 and R2C Leydig tumor cells, representing two different LCT subtypes, were used to generate syngeneic and xenograft mouse LCT models, respectively. In the syngeneic model, monotherapy with α-MHD effectively reduced tumor growth and angiogenesis. In the xenografts, which showed co-expression of histidine decarboxylase and CYP19, the combination of EGCG plus carboplatin was the most effective therapy, leading to LCT growth arrest and undetectable levels of plasmatic estradiol. Testicular and body weights remained unaltered. On the basis of this study, histidine decarboxylase may emerge as a novel pharmacological target for LCT treatment.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Multi-drug resistant (MDR) Shigella flexneri 2a, one of the leading bacterial agents of diarrhoeal mortality, has posed challenges in treatment strategies. The present study was conducted to identify potential therapeutic biomarkers using gene interaction network (GIN) in order to understand the cellular and molecular level interactions of both antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and virulence genes through topological and clustering metrics. Statistically significant differential gene expression (DGE), structural chemistry and dynamics were incorporated to elucidate biomarker for sustainable therapeutic regimen against MDR S. flexneri. Functional enrichments and topological metrics revealed evgS, ybjZ, tolC, gyrA, parC and their direct interactors to be associated with diverse AMR mechanisms. Histidine kinase EvgS was considered as the hub protein due to its highest prevalence in the molecular interactome profiles of both the AMR (71.6%) and virulence (45.8%) clusters interconnecting several genes concerning two-component system (TCS). DGE profiles of ΔPhoPQ (deleted regulatory PhoP and sensor PhoQ) led to the upregulation of TCS comprising EvgSA thereby validating EvgS as a promising therapeutic biomarker. Druggability and structural stability of EvgS was assessed through thermal shifts, backbone stability and coarse dynamics refinement. Structure-function relationship was established revealing the C-terminal extracellular domain as the drug-binding site which was further validated through molecular dynamics simulation. Structure elucidation of identified biomarker followed by secondary and tertiary structural validation would prove pivotal for future therapeutic interventions against subverting both AMR and virulence posed by this strain.

Such intelligent systems that release payloads in response to the physiological characteristics of tumor sites have several advantages over conventional drug carriers, offering, in particular, enhanced therapeutic effects and decreased toxicity. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is acidic, suggesting the potential of pH-responsive nanovehicles for enhancing treatment specificity and efficacy. The synthetic polypeptide poly(l-histidine) (PLH) is an appropriate candidate for the preparation of pH-responsive nanovehicles because the pKa of PLH (approximately 6.0) is close to the pH of the acidic TME. In addition, the pendent imidazole rings of PLH yield pH-dependent hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic phase transitions in the acidic TME, triggering the destabilization of nanovehicles and the subsequent release of encapsulated chemotherapeutic agents. Herein, we highlight the state-of-the-art design and construction of pH-responsive nanovehicles based on PLH and discuss the future challenges and perspectives of this fascinating biomaterial for targeted cancer treatment and \"benchtop-to-clinic\" translation.",

Patients with LAHNSCC who completed the entire planned CCRT course and received at least 25 kcal/kg/day and 1 g of protein/kg/day during CCRT were prospectively recruited. Clinicopathological variables, anthropometric data, blood NIBs, CCRT-related factors, TBC data, and metabolite panels before and after treatment were collected; 44 patients with LAHNSCC were enrolled. Nine patients (20.4%) experienced TIs. Patients with TIs experienced greater reductions in hemoglobin, serum levels of albumin, uric acid, histidine, and appendicular skeletal mass, and suffered from more grade 3/4 toxicities than those with no TI. Neither increased daily calorie supply (≥30 kcal/kg/day) nor feeding tube placement was correlated with TI. Multivariate analysis showed that treatment-interval changes in serum albumin and histidine levels, but not treatment toxicity, were independently associated with TI. Thus, changes in serum levels of albumin and histidine over the treatment course could cause TI in patients with LAHNSCC following CCRT."

      "abstract": "SCOPE: Colitis is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease of colon. Clinical studies show that meat-rich diet plays a critical role in the relapse of colitis. However, it is unclear whether the microbial metabolites of histidine, which is an amino acid widely found in meat, have an impact on the health of the intestine. METHODS AND RESULTS: Six metabolites of histidine are given to IEC-6 cells. The cell activity measurement shows that imidazole propionate (IMP) is the most detrimental metabolite. Then, IMP is injected to mice by rectal administration, with blood and colon tissues collected for the measurement of colitis related parameters. The results show that treatment with IMP significantly increased NF-κB, iNOS, and IL-6, decreased number of goblet cell, and inhibited expressions of miR-146b. However, overexpression of miR-146b in mice rescues the decline of the physical condition. Additionally, Notch receptor 1 (Notch1) is identified as a target gene of miR-146b. Further analysis shows that miR-146b restored the abundance of goblet cells by regulating Notch1 signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: IMP is able to induce intestinal inflammation, impairs the intestinal barrier, and affects the proliferation of goblet cells. The underlined mechanism may partially contribute to the dysregulation of miR-146b/Notch1 axis.",

      "abstract": "Accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment are highly essential in the management of malaria, which is one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical regions including Nigeria. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of malaria histidine-rich protein 2-based rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and microscopy in the diagnosis of falciparum malaria in Nigeria. This was a cross-sectional and hospital-based study. The standard method of microscopy was used as the gold standard. Giemsa stained thick and thin smears were prepared to count and detect malaria parasite species. Also, a malaria histidine-rich protein 2-based RDT was used to detect malaria parasites and diagnostic efficacy were determined through the measure of sensitivity, specificity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), diagnostic accuracy and Youden Index (J). The result showed that out of the total 303 individuals examined, a total malaria prevalence of 67.0% and 68.0% were recorded for micr oscopy and RDT, respectively. Additionally, the sensitivity (95% C.I), specificity (95% C.I), PPV (95% C.I), and NPV (95% C.I) of RDT compared to microscopy were 97.54 (94.36-98.94), 92.00 (85.00-95.89), 96.12 (92.53-98.02), and 94.85 (88.50- 97.78), respectively. The diagnostic accuracy (95% C.I) and Youden Index (J) were 95.71 (92.77- 97.70) and 0.89, respectively. Conclusively, our study revealed that RDT continues to remain efficacious. Thus, while malaria diagnosis by microscopy which is the gold standard remains the major method of malaria detection, it should be complemented by rapid diagnostic test (RDT), particularly in high malaria endemic regions where mean parasite density of patients are usually high.",

The aim of this study was to quantify HRG and HMGB1 levels in patients with Kawasaki disease (KD) and evaluate their use in the clinical management of KD. METHODS: This study was prospectively performed. Patients were divided into two groups and analysed depending on whether KD symptoms improved by Day 10 of illness. HRG, HMGB1, and other laboratory variables were measured before the first treatment in all cases and, in most cases, afterwards for assessing trends. RESULTS: In this prospective study, we enrolled 60 patients with KD and 48 healthy controls. The HRG level in the KD group was significantly lower than that in the healthy control group; HMGB1 levels showed no obvious differences. In the KD group, HRG levels were negatively correlated with white blood cell and neutrophil counts. In the poor responders and responders groups, a tendency for a decrease in HRG and HMGB1 levels, respectively, was observed from pretreatment to post-treatment. CONCLUSIONS: HRG and HMGB1 are related to the pathogenesis of KD; low HRG and high HMGB1 levels cause resistance against KD treatment.",

      "abstract": "Recent approvals of siRNA-based products motivated the scientific community to explore siRNA as a treatment option for several intractable ailments, especially cancer. The success of approved siRNA therapy requires a suitable and safer drug delivery agent. Herein, we report a series of oleyl conjugated histidine-arginine peptides as a promising nonviral siRNA delivery tool. The conjugated peptides were found to bind with the siRNA at N/P ratio ≥ 2 and demonstrated complete protection for the siRNA from early enzymatic degradation at N/P ratio ≥ 20. Oleyl-conjugated peptide -siRNA complexes were found to be noncytotoxic in breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and normal breast epithelial cells (MCF 10A) at N/P ratio of ~40. The oleyl-R3-(HR)4 and oleyl-R4-(HR)4 showed ~80-fold increased cellular uptake in MDA-MB-231 cells at N/P 40. Moreover, the conjugated peptides-siRNA complexes form nanocomplexes (~115 nm in size) and have an appropriate surface charge to interact with the cell membrane and cause cellular internalization. Furthermore, this study provides a proof-of-concept that oleyl-R5-(HR)4 can efficiently silence STAT-3 gene (~80% inhibition) in MDA-MB-231 cells with similar effectiveness to Lipofectamine. Further exploration of this approach holds a great promise in discovering a successful in vivo siRNA delivery agent with a favorable pharmacokinetic profile."

A lifesaving early specific diagnosis and treatment is a challenge as no gold standard technique exists that can alone allow a rapid and reliable diagnosis of sepsis. Histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) is a promising new biomarker of sepsis that can contribute to enhance current sepsis diagnostic tools. The current study aimed to evaluate HRG as a diagnostic biomarker for sepsis compared to the conventionally used biomarkers, procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP). The study included 67 participants classified into 3 groups: Control (n=19), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) patients (n=24) and sepsis patients (n=24). Serum HRG, CRP and PCT levels were measured by ELISA techniques. HRG level was significantly reduced in sepsis patients compared with SIRS patients (P < 0.001) and controls (P < 0.001) with overall statistically significant differences between the three groups (P < 0.001). Serum levels of the 3 biomarkers revealed increased PCT level in SIRS and sepsis groups, (P=0.002 and p < 0.001 respectively), CRP level significantly increased in sepsis (P < 0.001) but not in SIRS patients (P=0.525). The area under the curve (AUC) value was 0.988 for HRG, 0.966 for PCT and 0.859 for CRP respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for diagnosis of HRG were 95.8%, 93%, 88.5%, and 97.6%, respectively. In conclusion, HRG could be a good indicator for sepsis, that can discriminate sepsis and SIRS patients in ICU.",

The novel c.2172+1G>T splice-site mutation in the ATP7A gene confirmed MD. He was treated with subcutaneous administration of locally prepared copper-histidine (Cu-His). Following the therapy, hair manifestation was restored and serum ceruloplasmin was normalised 1 month later. Despite the treatment, epilepsy, neurodevelopment and osteoporosis still progressed.

Our results found that UMH treatment effectively avoided excessive liquid withdrawal, and disrupted myofibril integrity by modifying the water distribution and weakening connection of actin-myosin with increased muscle pH. The ultrasound-treated sample provided more opportunity for the filtration of L-histidine to intervene the isoelectric point and conformation of muscle protein. The activated caspase-3 and changes of ATPase activity in UMH-treated meat accelerated the postmortem ageing, and L-histidine might competitively inhibit the actin-myosin binding by the imidazole group. UMH decreased the surface hydrophobicity by shielding hydrophobic area and unfolding the actomyosin structure. In addition, the increased actomyosin solubility with smaller particle size enhanced the SH content for better cross-linking of myosin tail, and formation of heat-set gelling protein structure. Therefore, UMH treatment manifested the potential to improve beef quality.",

Two-component systems efficiently perform this role, typically comprised of a transmembrane sensor kinase and a cytoplasmic response regulator. In this review, we describe the role of two-component systems in bacterial pathogenesis, focusing predominantly on the role of sensor kinases of M. tuberculosis. We highlight important features of sensor kinases in mycobacterial infection, discuss ways in which these signaling proteins sense and respond to environments, and how this is attuned to their intracellular lifestyle. Finally, we discuss recent studies which have identified and characterized inhibitors of two-component sensor kinases toward establishing a new strategy in anti-mycobacterial therapy.",

      "abstract": "A novel nanofiber-based solid phase extraction (NFSPE) coupled with HPLC-DAD was developed for the determination of salivary histidine, a new potential index of physiological events. The treatment of the sample was based on a coupling reaction of histidine with the diazotization products of sulfanilic acid and sodium nitrite in a slightly alkaline medium, followed by NFSPE. Nanofibers comprising polystyrene and zinc acetate were used as a novel solid-phase sorbent to extract derived histidine via the chelation of Zn2+ with the imidazole group in the analyte. The eluted target compound was analyzed by HPLC-DAD. Good linearity was achieved with the concentrations of histidine ranging from 0.645 to 64.5 µM; the detection limit was 0.193 µM. The intra-day and inter-day coefficients of variation were less than 8.0%. The method was successfully applied to the determination of salivary histidine in the subjects exposed to a public speaking stress.",

      "abstract": "Histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) is a new type of Ca2+ homeostasis regulator, which acts as a nonnegligible role in regulating intracellular calcium homeostasis. Here, we demonstrated that HRC expression was upregulated in human gastric cancer (GC) samples, and its expression level was closely correlated with the overall survival (OS) rate of GC patients and the malignant potential of GC cell lines. Knockdown of HRC inhibited migration, invasion, and proliferation of GC cell lines in vitro, while HRC overexpression promoted GC cell migration, invasion, and proliferation in vitro, as well as the growth of subcutaneous tumors and peritoneal tumors in vivo. In terms of the mechanism, knockdown of HRC reduced the intracellular calcium ion level and the CaM protein level. Through cell function experiments, we found that HRC regulated the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway through Ca2+/CaM signaling and ultimately affected the epithelial‑mesenchyme transition (EMT) of GC. In summary, we revealed that HRC represents a potential target for GC treatment."

      "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, is the first-line therapy for advanced HCC. However, long-term exposure to sorafenib often results in reduced sensitivity and the development of resistance. Although various amino acids have been shown to contribute to cancer initiation and progression, little is known about the effects of histidine, a dietary essential amino acid that is partially taken up via histidine/large neutral amino acid transporter (LAT1), on cancer cells. In this study, we evaluated the effects of histidine on HCC cells and sensitivity to sorafenib. Remarkably, we found that exogenous histidine treatment induced a reduction in the expression of tumor markers related to glycolysis (GLUT1 and HK2), inflammation (STAT3), angiogenesis (VEGFB and VEGFC), and stem cells (CD133). In addition, LAT1 expression was downregulated in HCC tumor regions with high expression of GLUT1, CD133, and pSTAT3, which are known to induce sorafenib resistance. Finally, we demonstrated that combined treatment with sorafenib and histidine could be a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance the sensitivity to sorafenib, thereby improving long-term survival in HCC."

OBJECTIVE: The model of the sebocyte cell line SZ95 was used to identify methylated CpG islands at the 5'-end of the FHIT gene and the decrease of gene expression as well as the increase of double-stranded (ds) DNA breaks were examined. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Methylation, immunofluorescence analysis, promotor sequencing and treatment of SZ95 cells with 5‑azacytidine/trichostatin A (TSA). RESULTS: The cultivation was accompanied by an increasing methylation of the CpG islands, a decrease of the FHIT gene expression and an accumulation of ds-DNA breaks. Treatment with 5‑azacytidine/TSA showed a decrease in DNA methylation and a re-expression of FHIT transcripts. DISCUSSION: Epigenetic changes in the cellular genome are caused by in vitro cell culture. Consequently, a positive selection of sebocytes with an epigenetically inactivated FHIT locus occurs.",

Growing research evidence suggests that phospholysine phosphohistidine inorganic pyrophosphate phosphatase (LHPP) plays an important role in inhibiting tumor cell progression. It has been reported in the literature that LHPP is expressed at low levels in tumor tissues and cells and that patients with low LHPP expression have a poorer prognosis. Functional studies have shown that LHPP can inhibit tumor cell proliferation, metastasis, and apoptosis by affecting different target genes. In addition, researchers have used iDPP nanoparticles to deliver LHPP plasmids to treat tumors, demonstrating the great potential of LHPP plasmids for cancer therapy. In our review, we highlight the biological functions and important downstream target genes of LHPP in tumors, providing a theoretical basis for the treatment of human cancers. Although not thoroughly studied in terms of tumor mechanisms, LHPP still represents a promising and effective anticancer drug target.",

In this context, various non-viral gene carriers are being explored to transfer DNA or RNA sequences into target cells. Here, we review the applications of the naturally occurring amino acid histidine in the delivery of nucleic acids into cells. The biocompatibility of histidine-enhanced gene delivery systems has encouraged their wider use in gene therapy. Histidine-based gene carriers can involve the modification of peptides, dendrimers, lipids or nanocomposites. Several linear polymers, such as polyethylenimine, poly-l-lysine (synthetic) or dextran and chitosan (natural), have been conjugated with histidine residues to form complexes with nucleic acids for intracellular delivery. The challenges, opportunities and future research trends of histidine-based gene deliveries are investigated.",

Therefore, HDC-KO mice are considered a valuable TS pathophysiological model as it reveals the underlying pathological mechanisms that cannot be obtained from patients with TS, thus advancing the development of treatment strategies for TS and other tic disorders. This review summarizes some of the recent research hotspots and progress in HDC-KO mice, aiming to deepen our understanding of brain mechanisms relevant to TS. Furthermore, we encapsulate the possible brain nerve cell changes in HDC-KO mice and their potential roles in TS to provide multiple directions for the future research on tics.",

Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are regarded as favorable gene delivery vehicles due to their low toxicity, ease of synthesis and ability to be functionalized. This study aimed to prepare functionalized AuNPs (FAuNPs) and evaluate their folate-targeted and nontargeted pCMV-Luc-DNA delivery in breast cancer cells in vitro. CS was added to induce stability and positive charges to the AuNPs (Au-CS), histidine (Au-CS-His) to enhance endosomal escape and folic acid for folate-receptor targeting (Au-CS-FA-His). The FAuNP:pDNA nanocomplexes possessed favorable sizes (<135 nm) and zeta potentials (<-20 mV), strong compaction efficiency and were capable of pDNA protection against nuclease degradation. These nanocomplexes showed minimal cytotoxicity (>73% cell viability) and enhanced transgene activity. The influence of His was notable in the HER2 overexpressing SKBR3 cells, which produced higher gene expression. Furthermore, the FA-targeted nanocomplexes enhanced receptor-mediated endocytosis, especially in MCF-7 cells, as confirmed by the receptor competition assay. While the role of His may need further optimization, the results achieved suggest that these FAuNPs may be suitable gene delivery vehicles for breast cancer therapeutics."
