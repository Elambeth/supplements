      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tumor characterization and treatment efficacy are associated with tissue hypoxia. MR-derived oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) may offer valuable tumor insights but depends on multiple measurement parameters, often requiring multiple sequence acquisitions. Specific multi-parametric sequences offer direct access to MR parameter sets within short acquisition times. PURPOSE: To evaluate the potential of gradient-echo spin-echo echo-planar imaging with keyhole (GE-SE EPIK)-derived parameters (OEF/T2/T2*/venous cerebral blood volume (vCBV)) to characterize increased metabolic activity tissue identified in [18F]fluoroethyl-L-tyrosine (FET) PET, serving as a surrogate for neoplastic tissue. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. POPULATION: Fifty-seven brain tumor patients (female/male:31/26; age 27-73 years) with 66 histologically confirmed lesions (suspected glioblastoma (16), glioblastoma (28), astrocytoma (11), metastasis (6), oligodendroglioma (5)). FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 10-echo GE-SE EPIK sequence at 3 T. ASSESSMENT: GE-SE EPIK data were acquired in a hybrid MR PET scanner during FET PET acquisitions. Two tumor segmentations based on FET-PET uptake and FLAIR hyperintensities were manually created. Mean GE-SE EPIK-derived parameters were calculated within tumor regions and compared to contralateral reference values. Relative tumor-to-reference parameters were compared across tumor types. STATISTICAL TESTS: One/two-sampled, two-tailed t-tests of mean relative MR-derived parameters. p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Significantly increased T2/T2* and decreased vCBV/OEF were found in FET-PET and FLAIR-derived VOIs. Latter showed decreased R2'. Significant correlation between FET uptake and T2/T2* was found in FET-VOIs (Pearson correlation: 0.26/0.31, respectively). Oligodendrogliomas showed significant differences to glioblastomas (rR2', rOEF) and astrocytomas (rR2'). Metastasis showed different rT2 values than suspected gliomas. Astrocytoma differed from gliomas in FET-TBR. Susceptibility artifacts in T2* maps from air-tissue interfaces limited qualitative data interpretation. DATA CONCLUSION: GE-SE EPIK provides multiple MR parameters that are sensitive to expected changes in tumor regions obtained from FET and FLAIR thresholds. Susceptibility artifacts in T2*/OEF maps made the differentiation between tumor relapse and treatment-related changes challenging. However, certain MR-derived parameters showed the ability to distinguish tumor types. EVIDENCE LEVEL: 3. TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2."

      "abstract": "The goal of this study was to conduct an external, independent validation of an O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine ([18F]FET) PET automatic segmentation network on a cohort of patients with glioblastoma. Methods: Twenty-four patients with glioblastoma were included in this study who underwent a total of 52 [18F]FET PET scans (preradiotherapy, n = 23; preradiotherapy retest, n = 9; follow-up, n = 20). Biologic tumor volume (BTV) delineation was performed by an expert nuclear medicine physician and an automatic segmentation network. Physician and automated quantitative metrics (BTV, mean tumor-to-background ratio [TBRmean], lesion SUVmean, and background SUVmean) were assessed with Pearson correlation and Bland-Altman analysis (bias, limits of agreement [LoA]). Automated and physician segmentation overlap was assessed with spatial and distance-based metrics. Results: BTV and TBRmean Pearson correlation was excellent for all time points (range, 0.92-0.98). In 2 patients with frontal lobe lesions, the network segmented the transverse sinus. Bland-Altman analysis showed network underestimation of physician-derived BTVs (absolute bias, 2.7 cm3, LoA, -13.1-18.5 cm3; relative bias, 27.9%, LoA, -95.3%-151.2%) and deviations for TBRmean were small (absolute bias, 0.03, LoA, -0.25-0.30; relative bias, 0.83%, LoA -14.27%-15.93%). Median Dice similarity coefficient, surface Dice similarity coefficient, Hausdorff distance, 95th percentile Hausdorff distance, and mean absolute surface distance were 0.83, 0.95, 10.94 mm, 3.62 mm, and 0.88 mm, respectively. Conclusion: Automated quantitative analysis was highly correlated with physician assessment; however, volume underestimation and erroneous segmentations may impact radiotherapy treatment planning and response assessment. Further training on a representative local dataset would likely be required for multicenter implementation."

      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impaired social interaction and repetitive stereotyped behavior, and effective interventions for the core autistic symptoms are currently limited. This study examines the protective role of L-tyrosine in alleviating ASD-like behavioral disorders in a valproic acid (VPA)-induced ASD mouse model and explores the underlying mechanisms via integrated multi-omics. We first investigated the potential of dietary L-tyrosine in mitigating autistic behavior. Subsequently, 16S rRNA sequencing, hippocampal transcriptomics, and neurotransmitter metabolome were employed to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Further, we conducted transplantation of the L-tyrosine-regulated microbiota in VPA-induced ASD mice. The results showed that L-tyrosine supplementation significantly mitigates ASD-like behavioral disorders, alleviates social communication deficits, and reduces repetitive behavior in autistic mice. L-tyrosine also attenuates the neuronal loss caused by VPA treatment in the DG and CA1 hippocampal regions in mice. The hippocampi of the L-tyrosine-treated mouse model for ASD displays modified gene expression profiles and different neurotransmitter levels. L-tyrosine also mitigates colonic barrier damage and amends the gut microbial composition and function. The integrative transcriptomic, metabolomic, and microbiome analysis shows strong connections between the hippocampal genes, neurotransmitters, and gut microbiota affected by L-tyrosine. The transplantation of microbiota from L-tyrosine-treated mice to VPA-induced ASD mice recipients recapitulated the preventive and protective effects of L-tyrosine on autistic behavior disorders. These findings suggest that dietary L-tyrosine may represent a viable, effective treatment option for managing the physiological and behavioral deficits associated with ASD."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amino acid PET using the tracer O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine (FET) is one of the most reliable imaging methods for detecting glioma recurrence. Here, we hypothesized that functional MR connectivity between the metabolic active recurrent tumor region and resting-state networks of the brain could serve as a prognostic imaging biomarker for overall survival (OS). METHODS: The study included 82 patients (26-81 years; median Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score, 0) with recurrent gliomas following therapy (WHO-CNS 2021 grade 4 glioblastoma, n = 57; grade 3 or 4 astrocytoma, n = 12; grade 2 or 3 oligodendroglioma, n = 13) diagnosed by FET PET simultaneously acquired with functional resting-state MR. Functional connectivity (FC) was assessed between tumor regions and 7 canonical resting-state networks. RESULTS: WHO tumor grade and IDH mutation status were strong predictors of OS after recurrence (P < .001). Overall FC between tumor regions and networks was highest in oligodendrogliomas and was inversely related to tumor grade (P = .031). FC between the tumor region and the dorsal attention network was associated with longer OS (HR, 0.88; 95%CI, 0.80-0.97; P = .007), and showed an independent association with OS (HR, 0.90; 95%CI, 0.81-0.99; P = .033) in a model including clinical factors, tumor volume and MGMT. In the glioblastoma subgroup, tumor volume and FC between the tumor and the visual network (HR, 0.90; 95%CI, 0.82-0.99, P = .031) were independent predictors of survival. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent gliomas exhibit significant FC to resting-state networks of the brain. Besides tumor type and grade, high FC between the tumor and distinct networks could serve as independent prognostic factors for improved OS in these patients."

      "abstract": "One of the most common clinical indications for amino acid PET using the tracer O-(2-[18F]-fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine (18F-FET) is the differentiation of tumor relapse from treatment-related changes in patients with gliomas. A subset of patients may present with an uptake of 18F-FET close to recommended threshold values. The goal of this study was to investigate the frequency of borderline cases and the role of quantitative 18F-FET PET parameters in this situation. Methods: We retrospectively identified 439 patients with pretreated gliomas who underwent 18F-FET PET for suspected tumor relapse and in whom the final diagnoses were confirmed by histopathology (n = 175) or clinical course (n = 264). Two experienced nuclear medicine physicians, masked to the final diagnoses, evaluated visually the PET scans by consensus. The findings were classified into 3 categories: clearly positive findings, borderline findings, or clearly negative findings. The diagnostic performance of established 18F-FET PET parameters (i.e., tumor-to-brain ratio [TBR], time-to-peak ratio, slope, intercept) was evaluated separately for these 3 groups using receiver operating characteristics analyses. Results: In the visual analysis, 18F-FET uptake was classified as clearly negative in 67 patients (15%), clearly positive in 234 patients (53%), and borderline in 136 patients (31%), with averaged mean TBR values of 1.5, 2.3, and 1.9, respectively. Receiver operating characteristics analysis showed a high accuracy for TBR values in patients rated as clearly positive or negative in visual rating (area under curve [AUC], 0.84-0.86), whereas the diagnostic performance of TBR values in borderline cases according to visual analysis was significantly lower (AUC, <0.60). Using TBR values ± 10% above or below the cutoff values increased the AUC by approximately 10% (AUC, 0.82-0.84). Conclusion: A considerable number of patients may present with borderline findings in 18F-FET PET. In these patients, quantitative parameters should be used with caution for decision-making. The use of TBR values above or below the range of the cutoff values ±10% may increase the reliability of quantitative parameters to differentiate between tumor relapse and treatment-related changes.",

METHODS: Twenty patients with nonresectable first recurrence of high-grade astrocytic glioma after EORTC/NCIC protocol underwent [18F]FET PET/MRI at baseline and after 2 cycles of treatment. Whole brain values of contrast-enhancing volume on MRI (CEV), of the mean (TBRmean) and maximal tumor-to-background ratio (TBRmax), and of metabolically active volume (MTV) on [18F]FET PET were obtained. Regional changes in [18F]FET uptake were assessed by parametric response mapping (PRM). Prediction of overall survival (OS) and response (OS > 11 months) were assessed by Cox and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, respectively. Also, MRI (response assessment in neuro-oncology [RANO] 2.0) and PET-based (PET RANO 1.0) response assessment criteria were compared. RESULTS: In ROC analysis responders were separated (P < .05) from nonresponders by lower MTV at follow-up (AUC 0.771, cutoff 18.3 mL), larger decrease in MTV (AUC 0.757, cutoff -5.3 mL), larger decrease in both TBRmax (AUC 0.814, cutoff -0.53) and relative TBRmax (AUC 0.829, cutoff -11%) and smaller PRM progressive volume (AUC 0.843, cutoff 4.0 mL). Change in CEV did not predict response. RANO 2.0 and PET RANO response assessment criteria had similar and only borderline prognostic values. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that [18F]FET PET is superior to contrast-enhanced MRI for early response assessment in patients with recurrent high-grade astrocytic glioma treated with nivolumab and bevacizumab."

      "abstract": "Although the disease caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is of great interest to public health organizations around the world, there are still no authorized antivirals for its treatment. Previously, dihalogenated anti-CHIKV compounds derived from L-tyrosine (dH-Y) were identified as being effective against in vitro infection by this virus, so the objective of this study was to determine the mechanisms of its antiviral action. Six dH-Y compounds (C1 to C6) dihalogenated with bromine or chlorine and modified in their amino groups were evaluated by different in vitro antiviral strategies and in silico tools. When the cells were exposed before infection, all compounds decreased the expression of viral proteins; only C4, C5 and C6 inhibited the genome; and C1, C2 and C3 inhibited infectious viral particles (IVPs). Furthermore, C1 and C3 reduce adhesion, while C2 and C3 reduce internalization, which could be related to the in silico interaction with the fusion peptide of the E1 viral protein. Only C3, C4, C5 and C6 inhibited IVPs when the cells were exposed after infection, and their effect occurred in late stages after viral translation and replication, such as assembly, and not during budding. In summary, the structural changes of these compounds determine their mechanism of action. Additionally, C3 was the only compound that inhibited CHIKV infection at different stages of the replicative cycle, making it a compound of interest for conversion as a potential drug.",

METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 17 consecutive patients with prolactinoma undergoing [18F]FET-PET/MRICR between October 2020 and September 2022 for either (1) additional information in case of difficult-to-visualize remnants after prior transsphenoidal surgery (TSS), or pharmacological treatment, or (2) radiological diagnosis in absence of a (clear) adenoma on diagnostic/post-treatment conventional MRI. RESULTS: [18F]FET-PET/MRICR identified a lesion in 14/17 patients, yet failed to identify active lesions in 2 patients with negative conventional MRI despite prolactin > 7.5 times upper limit of normal. [18F]FET-PET/MRICR results were inconclusive in 1 patient due to diffuse tracer uptake 10 weeks post-surgery. [18F]FET-PET/MRICR was completely concordant with a suspected lesion on conventional MRI in 10/17 patients, and partially concordant in 3/17 patients. New foci were identified in 4/17 patients. The [18F]FET-PET/MRICR conclusions influenced clinical shared decision-making in 15/17 patients, of whom 7 patients underwent TSS and 8 refrained from TSS. One patient underwent TSS despite negative [18F]FET-PET/MRICR, and one patient underwent additional imaging. Intraoperative findings corresponded with [18F]FET-PET/MRICR in 5/8 patients, and immunohistochemistry was positive in 5/8 patients. The treatment goal was achieved in 7/8 patients, and remission was achieved in 5/7 patients in whom total resection was considered feasible. CONCLUSION: [18F]FET-PET/MRICR can be of added value in the preoperative decision-making process for selected patients with difficult-to-localize prolactinoma (remnants), or patients lacking a substrate on conventional MRI.",

To address this issue, herein an innovative therapeutic strategy that integrates photothermal anticancer and normal cell protection is developed. A new type of nitrogen-doped carbon dot (ET-CD) has been synthesized in one step by hydrothermal method using ellagic acid and L-tyrosine as reaction precursors. The as-prepared ET-CD exhibits high photothermal conversion efficiency and good photothermal stability. After intravenous injection, ET-CD can accumulate at the tumor site and the hyperthermia generated under near infrared laser irradiation effectively ablates tumor tissues, thereby significantly inhibiting tumor growth. Importantly, owing to the inherited antioxidant activity from ellagic acid, ET-CD can remove reactive oxygen and nitrogen species produced in the body and reduce the levels of inflammatory factors induced by oxidative stress, so as to alleviate the damage caused by heat-induced inflammation to normal cells and tissues while photothermal anticancer. These attractive features of ET-CD may open the exploration of innovative therapeutic strategies to promote the clinical application of PTT.",

      "abstract": "Ingestion of L-theanine and L-tyrosine has been shown to reduce salivary stress biomarkers and improve aspects of cognitive performance in response to stress. However, there have been no studies to concurrently examine the impact of both L-theanine and L-tyrosine ingestion during a mental stress challenge (MSC) involving a brief cognitive challenge and a virtual reality based active shooter training drill. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the impact of ingestion of L-theanine and L-tyrosine on markers of stress and cognitive performance in response to a virtual reality active shooter drill and cognitive challenge. The cognitive challenge involved a Stroop challenge and mental arithmetic. Eighty subjects (age = 21 ± 2.6 yrs; male = 46; female = 34) were randomly assigned L-tyrosine (n = 28; 2000 mg), L-theanine (n = 25; 200 mg), or placebo (n = 27) prior to MSC exposure. Saliva samples, state-anxiety inventory (SAI) scales, and heart rate (HR) were collected before and after exposure to the MSC. Saliva was analyzed for stress markers α-amylase (sAA) and secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA). The MSC resulted in significant increases in sAA, SIgA, HR, and SAI. Ingestion of L-theanine and L-tyrosine did not impact markers of stress. However, the L-tyrosine treatment demonstrated significantly lower missed responses compared to the placebo treatment group during the Stroop challenge. These data demonstrate that ingestion of L-theanine or L-tyrosine does not impact markers of stress in response to a MSC but may impact cognitive performance. This study was pre-registered as a clinical trial (\"Impact of supplements on stress markers\": NCT05592561).",

The disease has variable phenotypic presentations across different ages, ranging from neonatal to the adult onset and from severe to asymptomatic varieties. Clinical features, muscle biopsy and genetic testing help in diagnosis. The histopathological examination shows the presence of rod-like structures or nemaline bodies in muscles. Management remains mainly supportive, and currently, there is no available curative treatment. This case report describes an infant presenting with gross hypotonia, poor handling of secretions and multiple extubation failures who was diagnosed by clinical exome sequencing. The patient harboured compound heterozygous variants in the NEB gene suggestive of nemaline rod myopathy. The newborn showed significant improvement in muscle strength after he was started on dietary L-tyrosine supplementation.

      "abstract": "Aromatic amino acids (AAs) have garnered particular interest due to their pivotal roles in numerous biological processes and disorders. Variations in AA self-assembly not only affect protein structures and functions, but their non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, and π-π stacking, yield versatile assemblies vital in bio-inspired material fabrication. Tyrosine (Tyr), a non-essential aromatic amino acid, holds multifaceted significance in the body as a protein building block, neurotransmitter precursor, thyroid hormone contributor, and melanin synthesis regulator. The proficiency of Cold Atmospheric Plasma (CAP) in generating a spectrum of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species has spurred innovative research avenues in the studies of biomolecular components, including its potential for targeted cancer cell ablation and biomolecule modification. In this work, we have assessed the chemical as well as the structural changes in Tyrosine-derived self-assembled structures arising from the CAP-induced reactive species. For a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism, different treatment times, feed gases, and the role of solvent acidification are compared using various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. LC-ESI-QQQ mass spectra unveiled the emergence of oxygenated and nitro derivatives of l-tyrosine following its interaction with CAP-derived ROS/RNS. SEM and TEM images demonstrated an enhanced surface size of self-assembled structures and the formation of novel nanomaterial-shaped assemblies following CAP treatment. Overall, this study aims to explore CAP's interaction with a single-amino acid, hypothesizing the creation of novel supramolecular structures and scrutinizing CAP-instigated transformations in l-tyrosine self-assembled structures, potentially advancing biomimetic-attributed nanomaterial fabrication which might present a novel frontier in the field of designing functional biomaterials."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The [18]F-fluoroethyl-l-tyrosine (FET) PET in Glioblastoma (FIG) study is an Australian prospective, multi-centre trial evaluating FET PET for newly diagnosed glioblastoma management. The Radiation Oncology credentialing program aimed to assess the feasibility in Radiation Oncologist (RO) derivation of standard-of-care target volumes (TVMR) and hybrid target volumes (TVMR+FET) incorporating pre-defined FET PET biological tumour volumes (BTVs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Central review and analysis of TVMR and TVMR+FET was undertaken across three benchmarking cases. BTVs were pre-defined by a sole nuclear medicine expert. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) confidence intervals (CIs) evaluated volume agreement. RO contour spatial and boundary agreement were evaluated (Dice similarity coefficient [DSC], Jaccard index [JAC], overlap volume [OV], Hausdorff distance [HD] and mean absolute surface distance [MASD]). Dose plan generation (one case per site) was assessed. RESULTS: Data from 19 ROs across 10 trial sites (54 initial submissions, 8 resubmissions requested, 4 conditional passes) was assessed with an initial pass rate of 77.8 %; all resubmissions passed. TVMR+FET were significantly larger than TVMR (p < 0.001) for all cases. RO gross tumour volume (GTV) agreement was moderate-to-excellent for GTVMR (ICC = 0.910; 95 % CI, 0.708-0.997) and good-to-excellent for GTVMR+FET (ICC = 0.965; 95 % CI, 0.871-0.999). GTVMR+FET showed greater spatial overlap and boundary agreement compared to GTVMR. For the clinical target volume (CTV), CTVMR+FET showed lower average boundary agreement versus CTVMR (MASD: 1.73 mm vs. 1.61 mm, p = 0.042). All sites passed the planning exercise. CONCLUSIONS: The credentialing program demonstrated feasibility in successful credentialing of 19 ROs across 10 sites, increasing national expertise in TVMR+FET delineation."

      "abstract": "The follow-up of glioma patients after therapeutic intervention remains a challenging topic, as therapy-related changes can emulate true progression in contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. 18F-fluoroethyl-tyrosine (18F-FET) is a radiopharmaceutical that accumulates in glioma cells due to an increased expression of L-amino acid transporters and, contrary to gadolinium, does not depend on blood-brain barrier disruption to reach tumoral cells. It has demonstrated a high diagnostic value in the differentiation of tumoral viability and pseudoprogression or any other therapy-related changes, especially when combining traditional visual analysis with modern radiomics. In this review, we aim to cover the potential role of 18F-FET positron emission tomography in everyday clinical practice when applied to the follow-up of patients after the first therapeutical intervention, early response evaluation, and the differential diagnosis between therapy-related changes and progression."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Treatment-related changes still represent a diagnostic challenge in the management of patients with suspect of recurrent glioblastoma. The specificity of conventional MRI in detecting recurrence remains limited. Brain PET imaging provides information on tumor metabolism and can contribute to improving the diagnostic accuracy of cerebral neoplasms. We performed a retrospective analysis to evaluate the clinical value of O-(2-18F-ﬂuoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (18F-FET) PET in the diagnosis of glioblastoma recurrence. METHODS: A retrospective analysis on patients considered suitable for salvage surgery for recurrence glioblastoma was performed. 18F-FET-PET was performed to investigate gadolinium enhancement suspected for recurrence. Static and kinetic 18F-FET parameters were analyzed and related to O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) status. RESULTS: Forty-two of the 51 patients who underwent 18F-FET-PET were re-operated. In each case, neuropathological diagnosis of tumor recurrence was confirmed. pMGMT hypermethylation was detected in 21 patients. Mean tumor-to-brain ratios (TBR) max was 3.87 (range 2.6-6.0). Static and kinetic 18F-FET parameters were similar according to MGMT status. CONCLUSIONS: 18FET-PET can be a reliable tool to improve the selection of patients suitable for salvage surgery for glioblastoma recurrence."

Due to the limited access to antiretroviral therapy, the associated side effects, and the resistance that the virus can generate, it has become necessary to continue the development of new antiviral agents. The study aimed to identify potential antiviral agents for HIV-1 by evaluating the in vitro and in silico activity of 16 synthetic di-halogenated compounds derived from L-Tyrosine. The compounds were tested for cytotoxicity, which was determined using MTT, and a combined antiviral screening strategy (pre- and post-infection treatment) was performed against R5 and X4 strains of HIV-1. The most promising compounds were evaluated against a pseudotyped virus (HIV-GFP-VSV-G), and the effectiveness of these compounds was measured through GFP flow cytometry. Also, the antiviral effect of these compounds was evaluated in PBMCs using flow cytometry and ELISA for p24. The TODB-2M, TODC-2M, TODC-3M, and YDC-3M compounds showed low toxicity and significant inhibitory activity against HIV-1. In silico docking and molecular dynamics assays suggest that the compounds' antiviral activity may be due to interaction with reverse transcriptase, viral protease, or envelope gp120."

      "abstract": "Boron has gained significant attention in medical research due to its B-10 isotope's high cross section for the reaction with thermal neutrons, generating ionizing particles that can eliminate cancer cells, propelling the development of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) for cancer treatment. The compound 4-borono-L-phenylalanine (BPA) has exhibited potential in BNCT clinical trials. Enhancing BPA uptake in cells involves proposing L-amino acid preloading. This study introduces a novel analytical strategy utilizing ICP-MS and single cell ICP-MS (SC-ICP-MS) to assess the effectiveness of L-tyrosine and L-phenylalanine preloading on human non-small cell lung carcinoma (A549) and normal Chinese hamster lung fibroblast (V79-4) models, an unexplored context. ICP-MS outcomes indicated that L-tyrosine and L-phenylalanine pre-treatment increased BPA uptake in V79-4 cells by 2.04 ± 0.74-fold (p = 0.000066) and 1.46 ± 0.06-fold (p = 0.000016), respectively. Conversely, A549 cells manifested heightened BPA uptake solely with L-tyrosine preloading, with a factor of 1.24 ± 0.47 (p = 0.028). BPA uptake remained higher in A549 compared to V79-4 regardless of preloading. SC-ICP-MS measurements showcased noteworthy boron content heterogeneity within A549 cells, signifying diverse responses to BPA exposure, including a subset with notably high BPA uptake. This study underscores SC-ICP-MS's utility in precise cellular boron quantification, validating cellular BPA uptake's heterogeneity.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Glioblastoma is the most common aggressive primary central nervous system cancer in adults characterised by uniformly poor survival. Despite maximal safe resection and postoperative radiotherapy with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide-based chemotherapy, tumours inevitably recur. Imaging with O-(2-[18F]-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) positron emission tomography (PET) has the potential to impact adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) planning, distinguish between treatment-induced pseudoprogression versus tumour progression as well as prognostication. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The FET-PET in Glioblastoma (FIG) study is a prospective, multicentre, non-randomised, phase II study across 10 Australian sites and will enrol up to 210 adults aged ≥18 years with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. FET-PET will be performed at up to three time points: (1) following initial surgery and prior to commencement of chemoradiation (FET-PET1); (2) 4 weeks following concurrent chemoradiation (FET-PET2); and (3) within 14 days of suspected clinical and/or radiological progression on MRI (performed at the time of clinical suspicion of tumour recurrence) (FET-PET3). The co-primary outcomes are: (1) to investigate how FET-PET versus standard MRI impacts RT volume delineation and (2) to determine the accuracy and management impact of FET-PET in distinguishing pseudoprogression from true tumour progression. The secondary outcomes are: (1) to investigate the relationships between FET-PET parameters (including dynamic uptake, tumour to background ratio, metabolic tumour volume) and progression-free survival and overall survival; (2) to assess the change in blood and tissue biomarkers determined by serum assay when comparing FET-PET data acquired prior to chemoradiation with other prognostic markers, looking at the relationships of FET-PET versus MRI-determined site/s of progressive disease post chemotherapy treatment with MRI and FET-PET imaging; and (3) to estimate the health economic impact of incorporating FET-PET into glioblastoma management and in the assessment of post-treatment pseudoprogression or recurrence/true progression. Exploratory outcomes include the correlation of multimodal imaging, blood and tumour biomarker analyses with patterns of failure and survival. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol V.2.0 dated 20 November 2020 has been approved by a lead Human Research Ethics Committee (Austin Health, Victoria). Other clinical sites will provide oversight through local governance processes, including obtaining informed consent from suitable participants. The study will be conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. Results of the FIG study (TROG 18.06) will be disseminated via relevant scientific and consumer forums and peer-reviewed publications. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ANZCTR ACTRN12619001735145.",

A well-known and key TB trait is caseous necrotic granuloma, which allows mycobacteria to reactivate and disseminate, thus confounding TB eradication programs. Amino acid (AA) metabolism is key to regulating immune responses in Mtb infections; however, it is currently unclear if AAs can be used to treat tuberculous granulomas. Here, we screened 20 proteinogenic AAs using a Mycobacterium marinum-infected zebrafish granuloma model. Only L-tyrosine simultaneously reduced Mycobacterium marinum (M. marinum) levels in zebrafish larvae and adults and inhibited intracellular pathogen survival levels. Mechanistically, L-tyrosine significantly upregulated interferon-γ (IFN-γ) expression in M. marinum -infected zebrafish adults but not in larvae. Using N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to inhibit reactive oxygen species (ROS), L-tyrosine appeared to inhibit Mtb intracellular survival by promoting ROS production. Thus, L-tyrosine as a non-essential AA may reduce mycobacterial survival in both macrophages and tuberculous granulomas. Our research provides a platform for the clinical development of AAs for active or latent TB patients infected with drug-sensitive or drug-resistant Mtb."

There are limited treatments for these conditions. Previously, we showed there is no expression of alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) in hypopigmented scars, and if these melanocytes are treated with synthetic α-MSH in vitro, they respond by repigmenting. The current study tested the same hypothesis in the in vivo environment using laser-assisted drug delivery (LADD). METHODS: HTSs were created in red Duroc pigs. At Day 77 (pre), they were treated with CO2 fractional ablative laser (FLSR). Synthetic α-MSH was delivered as a topical solution dissolved in  l-tyrosine (n = 6, treated). Control scars received LADD of  l-tyrosine only (n = 2, control). Scars were treated and examined weekly through Week 4. Digital images and punch biopsies of hyper, hypo-, and normally pigmented scar and skin were collected. Digital pictures were analyzed with ImageJ by tracing the area of hyperpigmentation. Epidermal sheets were obtained from punch biopsies through dispase separation and RNA was isolated. qRT-PCR was run for melanogenesis-related genes: tyrosinase (TYR), tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TYRP1), and dopachrome tautomerase (DCT). Two-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons and Dunnett's correction compared the groups. RESULTS: The areas of hyperpigmentation were variable before treatment. Therefore, data is represented as fold-change where each scar was normalized to its own pre value. Within the LADD of NDP α-MSH + l-tyrosine group, hyperpigmented areas gradually increased each week, reaching 1.3-fold over pre by Week 4. At each timepoint, area of hyperpigmentation was greater in the treated versus the control (1.04 ± 0.05 vs. 0.89 ± 0.08, 1.21 ± 0.07 vs. 0.98 ± 0.24, 1.21 ± 0.08 vs. 1.04 ± 0.11, 1.28 ± 0.11 vs. 0.94 ± 0.25; fold-change from pre-). Within the treatment group, pretreatment, levels of TYR were decreased -17.76 ± 4.52 below the level of normal skin in hypopigmented scars. After 1 treatment, potentially due to laser fractionation, the levels decreased to -43.49 ± 5.52. After 2, 3, and 4 treatments, there was ever increasing levels of TYR to almost the level of normally pigmented skin (-35.74 ± 15.72, -23.25 ± 6.80, -5.52 ± 2.22 [p < 0.01, Week 4]). This pattern was also observed for TYRP1 (pre = -12.94 ± 1.82, Week 1 = -48.85 ± 13.25 [p < 0.01], Weeks 2, 3, and 4 = -34.45 ± 14.64, -28.19 ± 4.98, -6.93 ± 3.05 [p < 0.01, Week 4]) and DCT (pre = -214.95 ± 89.42, Week 1 = -487.93 ± 126.32 [p < 0.05], Weeks 2, 3, and 4 = -219.06 ± 79.33, -72.91 ± 20.45 [p < 0.001], -76.00 ± 24.26 [p < 0.001]). Similar patterns were observed for scars treated with LADD of  l-tyrosine alone without NDP α-MSH. For each gene, in hyperpigmented scar, levels increased at Week 4 of treatment compared to Week 1 (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A clinically-relevant FLSR treatment method can be combined with topical delivery of synthetic α-MSH and l-tyrosine to increase the area of pigmentation and expression of melanogenesis genes in hypopigmented HTS. LADD of  l-tyrosine alone leads to increased expression of melanogenesis genes. Future studies will aim to optimize drug delivery, timing, and dosing.",

This may be a detriment to present initiatives to enhance the health of immune-compromised patients. Consequently, attention has been devoted to exploring new bioactive compounds in the field of drug discovery from endophytes. Therefore, this study is the first on the production of L-tyrosine (LT) as a promising bio-therapeutic agent from endophytic fungi. RESULTS: A new endophytic fungal isolate has been identified for the first time as Rhizopus oryzae AUMC14899 from Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) and submitted to GenBank under the accession number MZ025968. Separation of amino acids in the crude extract of this fungal isolate was carried out, giving a higher content of LT, which is then characterized and purified. LT exhibited strong antibacterial and anti-biofilm activities against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The recorded minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranged from 6 to 20 µg/ml. In addition, LT caused a strong reduction in biofilm formation and disrupted the preformed biofilm. Moreover, results indicated that LT supported cell viability, evidencing hemocompatibility and no cytotoxicity. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that LT has potential as a therapeutic agent due to its potential antibacterial, anti-biofilm, hemocompatibility, and lack of cytotoxic activities, which may also increase the range of therapy options for skin burn infections, leading to the development of a novel fungal-based drug.",

      "abstract": "The quantification of 3-nitro-l-tyrosine (NO2-Tyr), an in vivo biomarker of nitrosative stress, is indispensable for the clinical intervention of various inflammatory disorders caused by nitrosative stress. By integrating the unique features of BiVO4 and MoS2 with matching bandgap energies, electrode materials with amplified response signals can be developed. In this regard, we introduce a hydrothermally synthesized bismuth vanadate sheathed molybdenum disulfide (MoS2@BiVO4) heterojunction as a highly sensitive electrode material for the determination of NO2-Tyr. Excellent electrochemical behavior perceived for the MoS2@BiVO4 augments the performance of the sensor and allows the measurement of NO2-Tyr in biological media without any time-consuming pretreatments. The synergistic interactions between BiVO4 and MoS2 heterojunctions contribute to low resistance charge transfer (Rct = 159.13 Ω·cm2), a reduction potential Epc = -0.58 V (vs Ag/AgCl), and a good response range (0.001-526.3 μM) with a lower limit of detection (0.94 nM) toward the detection of NO2-Tyr. An improved active surface area, reduced charge recombination, and high analyte adsorption contribute to the high loading of the biomarker for improved selectivity (in the presence of 10 interfering compounds), operational stability (1000 s), and reproducibility (six various modified electrodes). The proposed sensor was successfully utilized for the real-time determination of NO2-Tyr in water, urine, and saliva samples with good recovery values (±98.94-99.98%), ascertaining the reliability of the method. It is noteworthy that the electrochemical activity remains unaffected by other redox interferons, thus leading to targeted sensing applications.",

This retrospective study and survey aimed to analyse our extensive database regarding the development of FET PET investigations, indications, and the referring physicians' rating concerning the role of FET PET in the clinical decision-making process. Between 2006 and 2019, we performed 6534 FET PET scans on 3928 different patients against a backdrop of growing demand for FET PET. In 2019, indications for the use of FET PET were as follows: suspected recurrent glioma (46%), unclear brain lesions (20%), treatment monitoring (19%), and suspected recurrent brain metastasis (13%). The referring physicians were neurosurgeons (60%), neurologists (19%), radiation oncologists (11%), general oncologists (3%), and other physicians (7%). Most patients travelled 50 to 75 km, but 9% travelled more than 200 km. The role of FET PET in decision-making in clinical practice was evaluated by a questionnaire consisting of 30 questions, which was filled out by 23 referring physicians with long experience in FET PET. Fifty to seventy per cent rated FET PET as being important for different aspects of the assessment of newly diagnosed gliomas, including differential diagnosis, delineation of tumour extent for biopsy guidance, and treatment planning such as surgery or radiotherapy, 95% for the diagnosis of recurrent glioma, and 68% for the diagnosis of recurrent brain metastases. Approximately 50% of the referring physicians rated FET PET as necessary for treatment monitoring in patients with glioma or brain metastases. All referring physicians stated that the availability of FET PET is essential and that it should be approved for routine use. Although the present analysis is limited by the fact that only physicians who frequently referred patients for FET PET participated in the survey, the results confirm the high relevance of FET PET in the clinical diagnosis of brain tumours and support the need for its approval for routine use."

      "abstract": "The presence of metal ions in drinking water treatment and distribution systems may affect the disinfection process of organic matter, which had aroused people's concern. L-tyrosine can complex with metal ions through carboxyl, carbonyl, and amino groups and affect its chemical reactions. In this paper, the complexation of L-tyrosine with common metal ions was studied and the influence of complexation on chlorination with different experimental factors was investigated. It was inferred that L-tyrosine complexed with metal ions by single dentate ligand or double dentate chelation in a ratio of 2:1. The degradation of L-tyrosine-metal complex followed the pseudo-first-order reaction kinetic. TCM, DCAA, and TCAA were the main species DBPs in the chlorination of L-tyrosine. Compared with L-tyrosine, the reaction rate constants of complex increased by 5.6%, the formation of trihalomethane production decreased by 21.5% and the formation of haloacetic acids production increased by 26.9% at the state of metal complexation. The effect of metal complexation on chlorination was more obvious than that of metal coexistence. For different metal complexation, the order of inhibition on trihalomethane production was Ca2+> Fe3+> Mn2+ and the order of promotion on haloacetic acids production was Mn2+> Fe3+> Ca2+. Moreover, it was found that alkaline conditions were favorable for the formation of DBPs due to the hydroxyl radical. The combination of ultraviolet and chlorine disinfection promoted L-Tyrosine degradation and DBPs generation, and the promotion efficiency follow the order: UV/Cl2> UV-Cl2> Cl2.",

However, many parameters of 18F-FET can be used for this differential diagnosis. Our purpose was to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of various 18F-FET parameters to differentiate true progression from TRC. METHODS: We performed a literature search using the following databases: the PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases up to 29 November 2020. We included studies that reported the diagnostic test results of 18F-FET to distinguish true progression from TRC. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool was used to evaluate the quality of the included studies. The diagnostic accuracy of various parameters was pooled using a random-effects model. RESULTS: We included 17 eligible studies (nine parameters). For static parameters of 18F-FET, the maximum and mean tumour-to-brain ratios (TBRmax and TBRmean) showed similar pooled sensitivities of 82% [95% confidence interval (CI), 80-85%) and 82% (95% CI, 78-85%), respectively. Among the three kinetic parameters (slope, time to peak and kinetic pattern), the kinetic pattern presented the optimal diagnostic value with a pooled sensitivity of 81% (95% CI, 75-86%). When combining the static and kinetic parameters, the diagnostic performance of 18F-FET was significantly improved, with a pooled sensitivity of 90% (95% CI, 84-94%) in the combination of TBR and kinetic patterns. CONCLUSIONS: 18F-FET static parameters alone showed a comparably high sensitivity in the differentiation between brain tumour true progression and TRC. Combining static and kinetic parameters provided improved diagnostic performance.",

In this study, gene carrier nanoparticles with minimal toxicity and high transfection efficiency were fabricated from a biocompatible and biodegradable polymer, l-tyrosine polyurethane (LTU), which was polymerized from presynthesized desaminotyrosyl tyrosine hexyl ester (DTH) and polyethylene glycol (PEG), by using double emulsion and solvent evaporation techniques, resulting in the formation of porous nanoparticles, and then used to evaluate their potential biological activities through molecular controlled release and transfection studies. To assess cellular uptake and transfection efficiency, two model drugs, fluorescently labeled bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA) and plasmid DNA-linear polyethylenimine (LPEI) complex, were successfully encapsulated in nanoparticles, and their transfection properties and cytotoxicities were evaluated in LX2 as a normal cell and in HepG2 and MCF7 as cancer cells. The morphology and average diameter of the LTU nanoparticles were confirmed using light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering, while confocal microscopy was used to validate the cellular uptake of FITC-BSA-encapsulated LTU nanoparticles. Moreover, the successful cellular uptake of LTU nanoparticles encapsulated with pDNA-LPEI and the high transfection efficiency, confirmed by gel electrophoresis and X-gal assay transfection, indicated that LTU nanoparticles had excellent cell adsorption ability, facilitated gene encapsulation, and showed the sustained release tendency of genes through transfection experiments, with an optimal concentration ratio of pDNA and LPEI of 1:10. All the above characteristics are ideal for gene carriers designed to transport and release drugs into the cytoplasm, thus facilitating effective gene therapy."

It also exhibits potential in the treatment of other orphan diseases as well as nervous system disorders - this is however limited by its side effects. In all living organisms, NTBC inhibits 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase activity, thereby affecting l-tyrosine (L-TYR) catabolism, which results in the therapeutic effect. The NTBC metabolites formed in patient's body is one of the causes of its side effects. The influence of NTBC and its metabolites; 2-amino-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzoic acid, 2-nitro-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzoic acid, and cyclohexane-1,3-dione on L-TYR catabolism was investigated in Raphanus sativus var. longipinnatus. Based on targeted LC-MS/MS analysis the concentration of NTBC and its metabolites in exposed plant tissues was determined. Based on non-targeted LC-MS/MS analysis the concentrations of products of L-TYR catabolism: levodopa, epinephrine, norepinephrine, normetanephrine, dopamine, tyramine and vitamins C, B5 and B6, additionally leucine and valine were identified as influenced by the NTBC or its metabolites. NTBC and its metabolites influenced L-TYR catabolism differently. Particularly significant changes were found in the content of epinephrine and normetanephrine: in the plant tissues exposed to NTBC, an increase in the content of these neurotransmitters was found (+42%), whereas in the plant treated with 2-amino-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzoic acid or 2-nitro-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzoic acid a decrease in concentration (-39% and 55%, respectively) was observed. Cyclohexane-1,3-dione does not influence epinephrine and normetanephrine concentration. The conclusions of this study provide a platform for expanded research on the causes of side effects of NTBC treatment.",

      "abstract": "Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC var. pruriens is the natural source for L-DOPA, precursor of the neurotransmitter dopamine, used widely in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, L-DOPA synthesis in plants is mediated either by Catecholamine (CA) pathway or alternate pathway catalyzed by Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) class of enzymes. Interestingly, the CA pathway itself can be initiated either by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or polyphenol oxidase (PPO). The CA pathway mediated synthesis of L-DOPA has not yet been proved in M. pruriens albeit strong indications. Therefore, the present investigation is focused on metabolite analysis of major intermediates of CA pathway up to the formation of dopamine and expression analysis of the selected genes, in different tissues and callus cultures. The four major intermediates, L-tyrosine, tyramine, L-DOPA and dopamine, were detected using NMR spectroscopy and quantified by HPLC in the callus cultures and in different tissues of the field plant, respectively. The various stages of leaf tissue were also analyzed for metabolite profiling. The relative amount of intermediates detected during the ontogeny of leaf indicates that PPO mediated conversion of L-tyrosine to dopamine through L-DOPA is relatively higher compared to dopamine production from tyramine. Among the two possible enzymes, activity of PPO was 6.5-fold more than TH in metabolically active young leaves compared to intermediate leaves. The gene expression profiles comprising upstream genes of L-tyrosine synthesis and downstream up to dopamine synthesis shows strong correlation with L-DOPA synthesis. The study validates CA pathway mediated synthesis of L-DOPA with PPO as candidate enzyme, in M. pruriens.",

Here, we examined the potential anti-arbovirus activity of ten di-halogenated compounds derived from L-tyrosine with modifications in amine and carboxyl groups. The activity of compounds on VERO cell line infection and the possible mechanism of action of the most promising compounds were evaluated. Finally, molecular docking between the compounds and viral and cellular proteins was evaluated in silico with Autodock Vina®, and the molecular dynamic with Gromacs®. Only two compounds (TDC-2M-ME and TDB-2M-ME) inhibited both ZIKV and CHIKV. Within the possible mechanism, in CHIKV, the two compounds decreased the number of genome copies and in the pre-treatment strategy the infectious viral particles. In the ZIKV model, only TDB-2M-ME inhibited the viral protein and demonstrate a virucidal effect. Moreover, in the U937 cell line infected with CHIKV, both compounds inhibited the viral protein and TDB-2M-ME inhibited the viral genome too. Finally, the in silico results showed a favorable binding energy between the compounds and the helicases of both viral models, the NSP3 of CHIKV and cellular proteins DDC and β2 adrenoreceptor.",

S. glaucescens could produce 125.25 ± 6.01 mg/L of melanin with a supply of 5 mM caffeic acid within 144 h. The ABTS radical scavenging capacity of S. glaucescens melanin was determined to be approximately 7.89 mg/mL of IC50 value, which was comparable to L-tyrosine-based eumelanin. The isolated melanin was used in cotton fabric dyeing, and the effect of copper ions, laccase enzyme treatment, and the dyeing cycle on dyeing performance was investigated. Interestingly, dyeing fastness was greatly improved upon treatment with the laccase enzyme during the cotton dyeing process. Besides, the supply of C5-diamine, which was reported to lead to more complex crosslinking between melanin units, to caffeic acid-based melanin synthesis was also investigated for higher production and novel functionalities. To facilitate the supply of caffeic acid and C5-diamine, E. coli strains expressing each or combinations of tyrosine ammonia lyase/p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase, feruloyl-CoA synthetase/enoyl-CoA hydratase/aldolase, and tyrosinase/lysine decarboxylase enzymes were prepared and investigated for their eumelanin, C5-diamine, and allomelanin production from L-tyrosine and L-lysine, respectively. Finally, H-NMR, FT-IR, and MALDI-TOF analysis of the synthetic melanin pigments were attempted to obtain the chemical information.",

Even though allergen immunotherapy (AIT) has shown clinical benefits in patients sensitized to different allergens, studies in asthmatic patients sensitized to olive pollen are insufficient. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness and safety of an ultra-short course of AIT with an L-tyrosine-adsorbed and monophosphoryl lipid A-adjuvanted olive pollen and olive/grass pollen extract (Pollinex Quattro®) in patients with allergic asthma in the real-world setting. METHODS: Retrospective, controlled study including patients with asthma, with and without allergic rhinitis, caused by sensitization to olive pollen from 11 centers in Spain. Patients received out-of-season (October-March) treatment with AIT in addition to their pharmacological treatment (active group) or pharmacological treatment (control group). Effectiveness variables, including unscheduled visits to the healthcare center, emergency room admissions, symptoms of asthma and rhinitis (following GEMA and ARIA classifications, respectively), and use of medication to treat asthma and rhinitis during the subsequent pollen season were compared between treatment groups. RESULTS: Of 131 study patients, 42 were treated with their usual asthma medication (control group) and 89 were treated with AIT (active group), either Pollinex Quattro® 100% olive pollen (n = 43, 48.3%) or 50% olive pollen/50% grass pollen (n = 46, 51.7%). Patients' demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between groups. The mean (SD) number of unscheduled visits to a healthcare center and emergency room admissions due to allergy symptoms was 2.19 (1.40) and 0.43 (0.63) in the control group, and 1.09 (1.25) and 0.11 (0.51) in the active group (P = 0.001 and P = 0.006, respectively). Severity and control of asthma symptoms remained unchanged (P = 0.347 and P = 0.179, respectively), rhinitis type improved (P = 0.025), and severity remained unchanged in the active compared to the control group. The use of short-acting beta-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids to treat asthma symptoms decreased in the active vs. the control group (P = 0.001 and P = 0.031, respectively). Twelve (13.5%) and two (2.2%) patients in the active group experienced local adverse reactions (edema, swelling, erythema, hives, pruritus, and heat), and systemic adverse reactions (hypertensive crisis and low-grade fever) to AIT, respectively; none was serious. CONCLUSION: AIT with Pollinex Quattro® specific for olive pollen and olive/grass pollens resulted in reduced visits to the healthcare center and emergency room and the use of asthma medication during the pollen season, indicating that this treatment was safe and effective in treating asthma in patients sensitized to these pollens."

Herein, we report an efficient, sustainable, one pot protocol for the fabrication of an unusual gold anisotropic shape, which we have named as twisted gold nanorods. These particles, though having dimensions in the nanoscale regime comparable to those of gold nanorods, display a continuous flat plasmon band like that of 2-D gold nanowire networks, extended up to the NIR-III (SWIR) range. The proposed strategy is simple and does not require any seed mediation, heating or potential toxic templates or organic solvents. Our process is based on the slow reduction of gold salt in presence of two mild reducing agents viz. l-tyrosine (an amino acid) and trisodium citrate. We observed that when both molecules are present together in particular concentrations, they direct the growth in form of twisted gold nanorods. The mechanism of growth has been described by a Diffusion Limited Aggregation numerical scheme, where it was assumed that both l-tyrosine and the gold ions in solution undergo a stochastic Brownian motion. The predictions of the model matched with the experiments with a good accuracy, indicating that the initial hypothesis is correct. The final structure has been thoroughly characterized in terms of morphology, while SERS and cytotoxic activity have also been demonstrated.",

      "abstract": "The diagnostic potential of PET using the amino acid analogue O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ([18F]FET) in brain tumor diagnostics has been proven in many studies during the last two decades and is still the subject of multiple studies every year. In addition to standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) using [18F]FET provides important diagnostic data concerning brain tumor delineation, therapy planning, treatment monitoring, and improved differentiation between treatment-related changes and tumor recurrence. The pharmacokinetics, uptake mechanisms and metabolism have been well described in various preclinical studies. The accumulation of [18F]FET in most benign lesions and healthy brain tissue has been shown to be low, thus providing a high contrast between tumor tissue and benign tissue alterations. Based on logistic advantages of F-18 labelling and convincing clinical results, [18F]FET has widely replaced short lived amino acid tracers such as L-[11C]methyl-methionine ([11C]MET) in many centers across Western Europe. This review summarizes the basic knowledge on [18F]FET and its contribution to the care of patients with brain tumors. In particular, recent studies about specificity, possible pitfalls, and the utility of [18F]FET PET in tumor grading and prognostication regarding the revised WHO classification of brain tumors are addressed.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Integrated histomolecular diagnostics of gliomas according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of 2016 has refined diagnostic accuracy and prediction of prognosis. This study aimed at exploring the prognostic value of dynamic O-(2-[18F]-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) PET in newly diagnosed, histomolecularly classified astrocytic gliomas of WHO grades III or IV. METHODS: Before initiation of treatment, dynamic FET PET imaging was performed in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) and anaplastic astrocytoma (AA). Static FET PET parameters such as maximum and mean tumour/brain ratios (TBRmax/mean), the metabolic tumour volume (MTV) as well as the dynamic FET PET parameters time-to-peak (TTP) and slope, were obtained. The predictive ability of FET PET parameters was evaluated concerning the progression-free and overall survival (PFS, OS). Using ROC analyses, threshold values for FET PET parameters were obtained. Subsequently, univariate Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression survival analyses were performed to assess the predictive power of these parameters for survival. RESULTS: Sixty patients (45 GBM and 15 AA patients) of two university centres were retrospectively identified. Patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant or O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter-methylated tumours had a significantly longer PFS and OS (both P < 0.001). Furthermore, ROC analysis of IDH-wildtype glioma patients (n = 45) revealed that a TTP > 25 min (AUC, 0.90; sensitivity, 90%; specificity, 87%; P < 0.001) was highly prognostic for longer PFS (13 vs. 7 months; P = 0.005) and OS (29 vs. 12 months; P < 0.001). In contrast, at a lower level of significance, TBRmax, TBRmean, and MTV were only prognostic for longer OS (P = 0.004, P = 0.038, and P = 0.048, respectively). Besides complete resection and a methylated MGMT promoter, TTP remained significant in multivariate survival analysis (all P ≤ 0.02), indicating an independent predictor for OS. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that dynamic FET PET allows the identification of patients with longer OS among patients with newly diagnosed IDH-wildtype GBM and AA.",

      "abstract": "PET using O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine (18F-FET) is useful to detect residual tumor tissue after glioma resection. Recent animal experiments detected reactive changes in 18F-FET uptake at the rim of the resection cavity within the first 2 wk after resection of gliomas. In the present study, we evaluated pre- and postoperative 18F-FET PET scans of glioma patients with particular emphasis on the identification of reactive changes after surgery. Methods: Forty-three patients with cerebral gliomas (9 low-grade, 34 high-grade; 9 primary tumors, 34 recurrent tumors) who had preoperative (time before surgery: median, 23 d; range, 6-44 d) and postoperative 18F-FET PET (time after surgery: median, 14 d; range, 5-28 d) were included. PET scans (20-40 min after injection) were evaluated visually for complete or incomplete resection and compared with MRI. Changes in 18F-FET uptake were evaluated by tumor-to-brain ratios in residual tumor and by maximum lesion-to-brain ratios near the resection cavity. Results: Visual analysis of 18F-FET PET scans revealed complete resection in 16 of 43 patients and incomplete resection in the remaining patients. PET results were concordant with MRI in 69% of the patients. The maximum lesion-to-brain ratio for 18F-FET uptake near the resection cavity was significantly higher than preoperative values (1.59 ± 0.36 vs. 1.14 ± 0.17; n = 43; P < 0.001). In 11 patients (26%), a flare phenomenon was observed, with a considerable increase in 18F-FET uptake compared with preoperative values in either the residual tumor (n = 5) or areas remote from the tumor on the preoperative PET scan (n = 6) (2.92 ± 1.24 vs. 1.62 ± 0.75; P < 0.001). Further follow-up in 5 patients showed decreasing 18F-FET uptake in the flare areas in 4 patients and progress in 1 patient. Conclusion: Our study confirmed that 18F-FET PET provides valuable information for assessing the success of glioma resection. Postoperative reactive changes at the rim of the resection cavity appear to be mild. However, in 23% of the patients, a postoperative flare phenomenon was observed that warrants further investigation.",

Importantly, this disease is associated with neurological and developmental abnormalities in many patients. Considering that the mechanisms underlying neurological dysfunction in hypertyrosinemic patients are poorly understood, in the present work we investigated the levels of cytokines - tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6 and IL-10 - in cerebellum, hippocampus, striatum of young rats exposed to chronic administration of L-tyrosine. In addition, we also investigated the impact of the supplementation with Omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) on the rodent model of Tyrosinemia. Notably, previous study demonstrated an association between L-tyrosine toxicity and n-3 PUFA deficiency. Our results showed a significant increase in the levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in brain structures when animals were administered with L-tyrosine. Cerebral cortex and striatum seem to be more susceptible to the inflammation induced by tyrosine toxicity. Importantly, n-3 PUFA supplementation attenuated the alterations on cytokines levels induced by tyrosine exposure in brain regions of infant rats. In conclusion, the brain inflammation is also an important process related to tyrosine neurotoxicity observed in the experimental model of Tyrosinemia. Finally, n-3 PUFA supplementation could be considered as a potential neuroprotective adjunctive therapy for Tyrosinemias, especially type II.",

      "abstract": "Background and Purpose: Glioblastomas are the most aggressive of all gliomas. The prognosis of these gliomas, which are classified as grade IV tumors by the World Health Organization (WHO), is poor. Combination therapy, including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy has variable outcomes and is expensive. In light of rising healthcare costs, there are societal demands for the justification of medical expenses. Therefore, we calculated the cost-effectiveness of follow-up [18F] fluoroethyl-L-tyrosine ([18F] FET) positron emission tomography (PET) scans performed on patients with glioblastoma after surgery and before commencing temozolomide maintenance treatment. Materials and Methods: To determine the cost-effectiveness of follow-up [18F] FET PET procedures, we examined published clinical data and calculated the associated costs in the context of Belgian healthcare. We subsequently performed one-way deterministic sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo analysis on the calculated ratios. Results: The decision tree based on overall survival rates showed that the number of non-responders identified using PET was 57.14% higher than the number of non-responders identified using conventional MRI. Further, the decision tree based on progression-free survival rates revealed a comparable increase of 57.50% non-responders identified. The calculated cost of two required PET scans per patient during the follow-up treatment phase was 780.50 euros. Two cost-effectiveness ratios were determined for overall survival and progression-free survival rates. Both of these calculations yielded very similar results: incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 1,365.86 and 1,357.38 euros, respectively, for each identified non-responder. The findings of the sensitivity analysis supported the calculated results, confirming that the obtained data were robust. Conclusion: Our comparative study of conventional MRI and [18F] FET PET revealed that the latter is a valuable tool for predicting the treatment responses of patients with glioblastomas to follow-up temozolomide maintenance treatment while considering its cost-effectiveness. Thus, [18F] FET PET scans enable clinical outcomes to be predicted accurately and at a low cost. Moreover, given the robustness of the data in the sensitivity analyses, the level of certainty of this outcome is acceptable."

However, reliable diagnostic criteria regarding therapy monitoring are not established. Here, we analysed the impact of additional 18F-fluoroethyl-tyrosine positron emission tomography (18F-FET PET) imaging following DC vaccination therapy. METHODS: We analysed data of GBM patients who received DC vaccination therapy. Following MRI diagnosis of tumour recurrence, additional static and dynamic 18F-FET PET imaging was performed. Vaccination was performed five times by intradermal injections, either weekly between concomitant radio/-chemotherapy and intermittent chemotherapy or after tumour recurrence, before re-radiation therapy. MRI and 18F-FET PET results were compared and correlated with clinical data. RESULTS: Between 2003 and 2016, 5 patients were identified who received DC vaccination and 18F-FET PET imaging (1 female/4 males; mean age: 44 ± 14 y). 3/5 patients showed congruent results of tumour progression. In three patients 18F-FET PET indicated treatment related changes, which was in contrast to MRI findings that indicated tumour progression. In these patients 18F-FET PET results could be confirmed by either neuropathological diagnosis or according to the RANO criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the small patients number our results indicate an additional impact of 18F-FET PET for monitoring outcome following vaccination therapy.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria is occurring due to the global overuse and misuse of β-lactam antibiotics. Infections caused by some bacteria which secrete metallo-β-lactamases (enzymes that inactivate β-lactam antibiotics) are increasingly prevalent and have become a major worldwide threat to human health. These bacteria are resistant to β-lactam antibiotics and MBL-inhibitor/β-lactam antibiotic combination therapy can be a strategy to overcome this problem. So far, no clinically available inhibitors of metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) have been reported. In this study, L-benzyl tyrosine thiol carboxylic acid analogues (2a-2k) were synthesized after the study of computational simulation by adding of methyl, chloro, bromo and nitro groups to the benzyl ring for investigation of SAR analysis. Although the synthesized molecules 2a-k shows the potent inhibitory effects against metallo-β-lactamase (IMP-1) with the range of Kic values of 1.04-4.77 µM, they are not as potent as the candidate inhibitor.",

In the present study, a separation process was established to convert PYR in the fermentation broth to l-tyrosine (TYR). Owing to its low solubility, TYR was easily precipitated out and could be easily removed from the reaction system. The whole-cell catalysis reaction solution was subjected to acid treatment, centrifugation, cation exchange column separation, rotary evaporation, Buchner funnel filtration, and dry separation method to obtain KGA and TYR powders. The purity/recovery rates of KGA and TYR were 98.16%/78.68% and 98.19%/73.46%, respectively. The use of biological pathways to separate KGA from the culture broth could make the separation process easier and further decrease the operation cost.",

This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of treadmill exercise and L-tyrosine treatment on the frequency and amplitude of epileptiform activity in rats. A total of 32 male albino Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: control, exercise, L-tyrosine, and exercise + L-tyrosine. L‑tyrosine was supplemented by oral gavage (500 mg/kg/day, 2.5 mL solution). The treatments were performed 5 days a week for 10 weeks. The rats were anesthetized and then administered 500 IU penicillin into the left cerebral cortex using a microinjector and electrocorticogram (ECoG) activity was recorded for 3 hours using a Power Lab data acquisition system. The frequency and the amplitude of the ECoG recordings were analyzed offline. Compared to the control group, spike frequency decreased significantly in all other groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of spike amplitude and latency. In this study, the effects of regularly administered treadmill exercise and L-tyrosine use on epileptiform activity were examined and evaluated together for the first time. The results of this study showed that regular exercise and L-tyrosine use decreased epileptiform activity. Further research and clinical trials are needed to investigate the extent to which L-tyrosine and physical activity interfere with the epileptic state by investigating different doses of L-tyrosine and different severity/ time/type of exercise protocols.",

This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic performance of several analytic approaches in the setting of suspected late pseudoprogression (PsP) in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). METHODS: Retrospective analysis of tumor recurrence was performed in 36 patients with histopathologically confirmed GBM and suspicion of recurrence/disease progression more than 12 weeks from cessation of irradiation based on MRI and Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology working group criteria. For differentiation of late PsP from true tumor recurrence, images were analyzed semiquantitatively employing tumor-to-brain ratios using 5 different approaches for tumor and normal brain reference region definition, respectively. Histopathology and/or clinical and imaging follow-up served as reference. Respective areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were compared. RESULTS: F-FET PET was able to reliably differentiate PsP from true tumor progression with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranging from 0.80 to 0.88 (all P < 0.01). Irrespective of the approach chosen, the classification differences between the applied methods were not significant (all P > 0.05), albeit approaches focusing on voxels with the highest uptake tended to perform superior. CONCLUSIONS: Irrespective of the analytical approach, F-FET PET is a robust tool for detection of late PsP with only minor differences between different analytical approaches. However, methodological standardization and harmonization are needed to ensure comparability between different centers.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: O-(2-[18F]-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) PET has a sensitivity of more than 90% to detect gliomas. In the remaining small fraction of gliomas without increased tracer uptake, some tumors even show photopenic defects whose clinical significance is unclear. METHODS: Glioma patients with a negative FET PET scan prior to neuropathological confirmation were identified retrospectively. Gliomas were rated visually as (i) having indifferent FET uptake or (ii) photopenic, if FET uptake was below background activity. FET uptake in the area of signal hyperintensity on the T2/fluid attenuated inversion recovery-weighted MRI was evaluated by mean standardized uptake value (SUV) and mean tumor-to-brain ratio (TBR). The progression-free survival (PFS) of photopenic gliomas was compared with that of gliomas with indifferent FET uptake. RESULTS: Of 100 FET-negative gliomas, 40 cases with photopenic defects were identified. Fifteen of these 40 cases (38%) had World Health Organization (WHO) grades III and IV gliomas. FET uptake in photopenic gliomas was significantly decreased compared with both the healthy-appearing brain tissue (SUV, 0.89 ± 0.26 vs 1.08 ± 0.23; P < 0.001) and gliomas with indifferent FET uptake (TBR, 0.82 ± 0.09 vs 0.96 ± 0.13; P < 0.001). Irrespective of the applied treatment, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutated WHO grade II diffuse astrocytoma patients with indifferent FET uptake (n = 25) had a significantly longer PFS than patients with IDH-mutated diffuse astrocytomas (WHO grade II) with photopenic defects (n = 11) (51 vs 24 mo; P = 0.027). The multivariate survival analysis indicated that photopenic defects predict an unfavorable PFS (P = 0.009). CONCLUSION: Photopenic gliomas in negative FET PET scans should be managed more actively, as they seem to have a higher risk of harboring a higher-grade glioma and an unfavorable outcome.",

This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of radiotracer uptake in newly diagnosed grade II or III gliomas according to the current 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification. PROCEDURES: A total of 35 treatment-naive patients (mean age, 48 ± 17 years) with histologically proven WHO grade II or III gliomas as defined by the current 2016 WHO classification were included. Static PET/CT imaging was performed 20 min after intravenous [18F]FET injection. Images were assessed visually and semi-quantitatively using regions of interest for both tumor (SUVmax, SUVmean) and background (BKGmean) to calculate tumor-to-background (TBR) ratios. The association among histological results, molecular markers (including isocitrate dehydrogenase enzyme and methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase status), clinical features (age), and PET findings was tested and compared with outcome (progression-free [PFS] and overall survival [OS]). RESULTS: Fourteen patients presented with grade II (diffuse astrocytoma n = 10, oligodendroglioma n = 4) and 21 patients with grade III glioma (anaplastic astrocytoma n = 15, anaplastic oligodendroglioma n = 6). Twenty-seven out of the 35 patients were PET-positive (grade II n = 8/14, grade III n = 19/21), with grade III tumors exhibiting significantly higher amino acid uptake (TBRmean and TBRmax; p = 0.03 and p = 0.02, respectively). PET-negative lesions demonstrated significantly prolonged PFS (p = 0.003) as compared to PET-positive gliomas. PET-positive disease had a complementary value in prognostication in addition to patient age, glioma grade, and molecular markers. CONCLUSIONS: Amino acid uptake as assessed by [18F]FET-PET/CT imaging is useful as non-invasive read-out for tumor biology and prognosis in newly diagnosed, treatment-naive gliomas according to the 2016 WHO classification.",

      "abstract": "Deficiency of hepatic enzyme tyrosine aminotransferase characterizes the innate error of autosomal recessive disease Tyrosinemia Type II. Patients may develop neurological and developmental difficulties due to high levels of the amino acid tyrosine in the body. Mechanisms underlying the neurological dysfunction in patients are poorly known. Importantly, Tyrosinemia patients have deficient Omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 PUFA). Here, we investigated the possible neuroprotective effect of the treatment with n-3 PUFA in the alterations caused by chronic administration of L-tyrosine on important parameters of energetic metabolism and oxidative stress in the hippocampus, striatum and cerebral cortex of developing rats. Chronic administration of L-tyrosine causes a decrease in the citrate synthase (CS) activity in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, as well as in the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) activities, and an increase in the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity in the hippocampus. Moreover, in the striatum, L-tyrosine administration caused a decrease in the activities of CS, SDH, creatine kinase, and complexes I, II-III and IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. We also observed that the high levels of L-tyrosine are related to oxidative stress in the brain. Notably, supplementation of n-3 PUFA prevented the majority of the modifications caused by the chronic administration of L-tyrosine in the cerebral enzyme activities, as well as ameliorated the oxidative stress in the brain regions of rats. These results indicate a possible neuroprotective and antioxidant role for n-3 PUFA and may represent a new therapeutic approach and potential adjuvant therapy to Tyrosinemia Type II individuals.",

      "abstract": "Assessment of residual tumor after resection of cerebral gliomas can be difficult with MRI and may be improved by amino acid PET. The aim of this experimental study was to investigate uptake of 2-18F-fluoroethyl-l-tyrosine (18F-FET) and l-[methyl-3H]-methionine (3H-MET) in residual tumor after surgery and possible false-positive uptake in treatment-related changes. Methods: F98 or GS-9L rat gliomas were implanted into the brain of 64 rats. Tumors were resected after 1 wk of tumor growth, and sham surgery was performed in an additional 10 animals. At different time points after surgery (1, 2, 3, 7, and 14-16 d), rats underwent ex vivo dual-tracer autoradiography using 18F-FET and 3H-MET. Histologic slices were evaluated by immunostaining for cell density and astrogliosis. Tracer uptake was quantified by lesion-to-brain ratios (L/B) at the rim of the resection cavity (considered treatment-related uptake) and in residual or recurrent tumor tissue. Four animals showing no residual tumor underwent PET 3 d after surgery to examine time-activity curves of 18F-FET uptake in treatment-related changes. Results: Treatment-related uptake with a mean L/B of 2.0 ± 0.3 for 18F-FET and a mean L/B of 1.7 ± 0.2 for 3H-MET was noted at the rim of the resection cavity in the first week after surgery, decreasing significantly by 14-16 d (P < 0.01). Treatment-related tracer uptake was significantly higher for 18F-FET than for 3H-MET (P < 0.001). Tracer uptake in rat gliomas exceeded treatment-related tracer uptake at all time points (P < 0.001), but the latter was in the range of human gliomas. Reactive astrogliosis was noted near the resection cavity from the second day after surgery. Time-activity curves of 18F-FET uptake in those areas revealed constantly increasing uptake. Conclusion: Surgery may induce significant treatment-related 18F-FET and 3H-MET uptake near the resection cavity in the first week after surgery, presumably caused by reactive astrogliosis. Treatment-related tracer uptake was less pronounced for 3H-MET, indicating that 11C-MET may be better suited for assessing the postoperative situation than 18F-FET. Assessment of residual tumor after surgery by amino acid PET seems to be more reliable after an interval of 14 d.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Subventricular zone (SVZ) involvement is associated with a dismal prognosis in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Dual-time point (dtp) O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) PET/CT (PET) may be a time- and cost-effective alternative to dynamic FET PET, but its prognostic value, particularly with respect to SVZ involvement, is unknown. METHODS: Thirty-five patients had two scans 5-15 and 50-60 min after i.v. FET injection to define tumor volumes and SVZ involvement before starting radiotherapy. Associations between clinical progression markers, MRI- and dtp FET PET-based tumor volumes, or SVZ involvement and progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed in univariable and multivariable analyses. RESULTS: The extent of resection was not related to outcomes. Albeit non-significant, dtp FET PET detected more SVZ infiltration than MRI (60% vs. 51%, p = 0.25) and was significantly associated with poor survival (p < 0.03), but PET-T1-Gad volumes were larger in this group (p < 0.002). Survival was shorter in patients with larger MRI tumor volumes, larger PET tumor volumes, and worse Karnofsky performance status (KPS), with fused PET-T1-Gad and KPS significant in multivariable analysis (p < 0.03). Uptake kinetics was not associated with treatment outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: FET PET-based tumor volumes may be useful for predicting worse prognosis glioblastoma. Although the presence of SVZ infiltration is linked to higher PET/MRI-based tumor volumes, the independent value of dtp FET PET parameters and SVZ infiltration as prognostic markers pre-irradiation has not been confirmed.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, PET using radiolabelled amino acids has gained considerable interest as an additional tool besides MRI to improve the diagnosis of cerebral gliomas and brain metastases. A very successful tracer in this field is O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) which in recent years has replaced short-lived tracers such as [11C]-methyl-L-methionine in many neuro-oncological centers in Western Europe. FET can be produced with high efficiency and distributed in a satellite concept like 2- [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose. Many clinical studies have demonstrated that FET PET provides important diagnostic information regarding the delineation of cerebral gliomas for therapy planning, an improved differentiation of tumor recurrence from treatment-related changes and sensitive treatment monitoring. In parallel, a considerable number of experimental studies have investigated the uptake mechanisms of FET on the cellular level and the behavior of the tracer in various benign lesions in order to clarify the specificity of FET uptake for tumor tissue. Further studies have explored the effects of treatment related tissue alterations on tracer uptake such as surgery, radiation and drug therapy. Finally, the role of blood-brain barrier integrity for FET uptake which presents an important aspect for PET tracers targeting neoplastic lesions in the brain has been investigated in several studies. Based on a literature research regarding experimental FET studies and corresponding clinical applications this article summarizes the knowledge on the uptake behavior of FET, which has been collected in more than 30 experimental studies during the last two decades and discusses the role of these results in the clinical context.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Glioblastoma inevitably recurs despite aggressive therapy. Therefore, it would be helpful to predict the location of tumor recurrence from postoperative imaging to customize further treatment. O-(2-18Ffluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine (FET) positron emission tomography (PET) might be a helpful technique, because tumor tissue can be differentiated from normal brain tissue with high specificity. METHODS: Thirty-two consecutive patients with perioperative and follow-up imaging data available were included. On postoperative FET-PET, the tumor/normal brain (TTB) ratio around the resection cavity borders was measured. Increased TTB ratios were recorded and anatomically correlated with the site of later tumor recurrence. On postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), residual contrast-enhancing tumor correlated with the site of later tumor recurrence. RESULTS: Location of progression was predictable using MRI alone in 42% of patients by residual tumor on postoperative MRI. FET-PET was predictive in 25 patients by a clear hot spot at the site of later tumor recurrence. In 3 patients, it was partially predictive and in 4 was not predictive of the tumor recurrence location. One patient without any tracer uptake was recurrence free at the last follow-up examination. In contrast to the postoperative MRI results, tumor recurrence was found in 79% at a site of elevated TTB ratio on postoperative FET-PET. Therefore, the predictability of the tumor recurrence location using postoperative FET-PET was greater than that with MRI, and all cases predictable using MRI could have been predicted using FET-PET. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative FET-PET can be helpful for planning subsequent therapy, such as repeat resection or radiotherapy, because tumor recurrence can be predicted with relatively greater sensitivity than with MRI alone.",

The in vitro effects of compounds 1-5 on protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP-1B), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and gamma (PPARα/γ), glucose transporter type-4 (GLUT-4) and fatty acid transport protein-1 (FATP-1) activation are reported in this paper. Compounds 1 and 3 were the most active in the in vitro PTP-1B inhibition assay, showing IC50s of approximately 44 μM. Treatment of adipocytes with compound 1 increased the mRNA expression of PPARγ and GLUT-4 by 8- and 3-fold, respectively. Moreover, both compounds (1 and 3) also increased the relative mRNA expression of PPARα (by 8-fold) and FATP-1 (by 15-fold). Molecular docking studies were performed in order to elucidate the polypharmacological binding mode of the most active compounds on these targets. Finally, a murine model of hyperglycemia was used to evaluate the in vivo effectiveness of compounds 1 and 3. We found that both compounds are orally active using an exploratory dose of 100 mg/kg, decreasing the blood glucose concentration in an oral glucose tolerance test and a non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus murine model. In conclusion, we demonstrated that both molecules showed strong in vitro and in vivo effects and can be considered polypharmacological antidiabetic candidates.",

Especially after radiochemotherapy, progression of contrast enhancement in MRI is equivocal and may represent either tumor progression or treatment-related changes. Here, the first case comparing postmortem whole-brain histology of a patient with pretreated glioblastoma with dynamic in vivo FET PET and MRI is presented. METHODS: A 61-year-old patient with glioblastoma initially underwent partial tumor resection and died 11 weeks after completion of chemoradiation with concurrent temozolomide. Three days before the patient died, a follow-up FET PET and MRI scan indicated tumor progression. Autopsy was performed 48 hours after death. After formalin fixation, a 7-cm bihemispherical segment of the brain containing the entire tumor mass was cut into 3500 consecutive 20μm coronal sections. Representative sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin stain, cresyl violet, and glial fibrillary acidic protein immunohistochemistry. An experienced neuropathologist identified areas of dense and diffuse neoplastic infiltration, astrogliosis, and necrosis. In vivo FET PET, MRI datasets, and postmortem histology were co-registered and compared by 3 experienced physicians. RESULTS: Increased uptake of FET in the area of equivocal contrast enhancement on MRI correlated very well with dense infiltration by vital tumor cells and showed tracer kinetics typical for malignant gliomas. An area of predominantly reactive astrogliosis showed only moderate uptake of FET and tracer kinetics usually observed in benign lesions. CONCLUSIONS: This case report impressively documents the correct imaging of a progressive glioblastoma by FET PET.",

This study explores the influence of dexamethasone therapy on [18F]FET uptake in the normal brain and its influence on the maximum and mean tumor-to-brain ratio (TBR). PROCEDURES: [18F]FET PET scans of 160 brain tumor patients were evaluated (80 dexamethasone treated, 80 untreated; each group with 40 men/40 women). The standardized uptake value of [18F]FET uptake in the normal brain (SUVbrain) in the different groups was compared. Nine patients were examined repeatedly with and without dexamethasone therapy. RESULTS: SUVbrain of [18F]FET uptake was significantly higher in dexamethasone-treated patients than in untreated patients (SUVbrain 1.33 ± 0.1 versus 1.06 ± 0.16 in male and 1.45 ± 0.25 versus 1.31 ± 0.28 in female patients). Similar results were observed in patients with serial PET scans. Furthermore, compared to men, a significantly higher SUVbrain was found in women, both with and without dexamethasone treatment. There were no significant differences between the different groups for TBRmax and TBRmean, which could have been masked by the high standard deviation. In a patient with a stable brain metastasis investigated twice with and without dexamethasone, the TBRmax and the biological tumor volume (BTV) decreased considerably after dexamethasone due to an increased SUVbrain. CONCLUSION: Dexamethasone treatment appears to increase the [18F]FET uptake in the normal brain. An effect on TBRmax, TBRmean, and BTV cannot be excluded which should be considered especially for treatment monitoring and the estimation of BTV using [18F]FET PET.",

In this study, the authors retrospectively assessed the diagnostic potential of FET PET in patients with MRI-suspected malignant progression of LGGs that had previously been treated and the relationship between FET uptake and MRI and molecular biomarkers. METHODS: Forty-two patients who had previously undergone surgical or multimodal treatment for a histologically verified LGG were referred for FET PET assessment because of clinical signs and/or MRI findings suggestive of tumor progression. Maximal and mean tumor-to-brain ratios (TBRmax and TBRmean, respectively) on FET PET as well as kinetic FET PET parameters (time to peak [TTP] and time-activity curve [TAC]) were determined. Final diagnoses were confirmed histologically. The diagnostic accuracy of FET parameters, separately and combined, for the detection of malignant progression was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Possible predictors that might influence the diagnostic accuracy of FET PET were assessed using multiple linear regression analysis. Spearman’s rank correlation r method was applied to determine the correlation between TBRmax and TAC, and molecular biomarkers from tumor tissues. RESULTS: A total of 47 FET PET scans were obtained and showed no significant association between FET parameters and contrast enhancement on MRI. ROC curve analyses overall were unable to demonstrate any significant differentiation between nontransformed LGGs and LGGs that had transformed to high-grade gliomas when evaluating FET parameters separately or combined. After excluding the oligodendroglial subgroup, a significant difference was observed between nontransformed and transformed LGGs when combining FET parameters (i.e., TBRmax > 1.6, TAC describing a plateau or decreasing pattern, and TTP < 25 minutes), with the best result yielded by a combined analysis of TBRmax > 1.6 and TAC with a plateau or decreasing pattern (sensitivity 75% and specificity 83%, p = 0.003). The difference was even greater when patients who had previously undergone oncological treatment were also excluded (sensitivity 93% and specificity 100%, p = 0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the presence of an oligodendroglial component (p = 0.029), previous oncological treatment (p = 0.039), and the combined FET parameters (p = 0.027) were significant confounding factors in the detection of malignant progression. TBRmax was positively correlated with increasing cell density (p = 0.040) and inversely correlated with IDH1 mutation (p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: A single FET PET scan obtained at the time of radiological and/or clinical progression seems to be of limited value in distinguishing transformed from nontransformed LGGs, especially if knowledge of the primary tumor histopathology is not known. Therefore, FET PET imaging alone is not adequate to replace histological confirmation, but it may provide valuable information on the location and delineation of active tumor tissue, as well as an assessment of tumor biology in a subgroup of LGGs.",

METHODS: Thirty-two pretreated gliomas (25 progressive or recurrent tumors, 7 treatment-related changes) were investigated with 18F-FET PET and PWI via a hybrid PET/magnetic resonance scanner. Volumes of interest with a diameter of 16 mm were centered on the maximum of abnormality in the tumor area in PET and PWI maps (relative cerebral blood volume, relative cerebral blood flow, mean transit time) and the contralateral unaffected hemisphere. Mean and maximum tumor-to-brain ratios as well as dynamic data for 18F-FET uptake were calculated. Diagnostic accuracies were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic analyses, calculating the area under the curve. RESULTS: 18F-FET PET showed a significant greater sensitivity to detect abnormalities in pretreated gliomas than PWI (76% vs. 52%, P = 0.03). The maximum tumor-to-brain ratio of 18F-FET PET was the only parameter that discriminated treatment-related changes from progressive or recurrent gliomas (area under the curve, 0.78; P = 0.03, best cut-off 2.61; sensitivity 80%, specificity 86%, accuracy 81%). Among patients with signal abnormality in both modalities, 75% revealed spatially incongruent local hot spots. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that 18F-FET PET is superior to PWI to diagnose progressive or recurrent glioma.",

      "abstract": "Tyrosinemia type II is an inborn error of metabolism caused by a deficiency in the activity of the enzyme tyrosine aminotransferase, leading to tyrosine accumulation in the body. Although the mechanisms involved are still poorly understood, several studies have showed that higher levels of tyrosine are related to oxidative stress and therefore may affect the cholinergic system. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of chronic administration of L-tyrosine on choline acetyltransferase activity (ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the brain of rats. Moreover, we also examined the effects of one antioxidant treatment (N-acetylcysteine (NAC) + deferoxamine (DFX)) on cholinergic system. Our results showed that the chronic administration of L-tyrosine decreases the ChAT activity in the cerebral cortex, while the AChE activity was increased in the hippocampus, striatum, and cerebral cortex. Moreover, we found that the antioxidant treatment was able to prevent the decrease in the ChAT activity in the cerebral cortex. However, the increase in AChE activity induced by L-tyrosine was partially prevented the in the hippocampus and striatum, but not in the cerebral cortex. Our results also showed no differences in the aversive and spatial memory after chronic administration of L-tyrosine. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrated an increase in AChE activity in the hippocampus, striatum, and cerebral cortex and an increase of ChAT in the cerebral cortex, without cognitive impairment. Furthermore, the alterations in the cholinergic system were partially prevented by the co-administration of NAC and DFX. Thus, the restored central cholinergic system by antioxidant treatment further supports the view that oxidative stress may be involved in the pathophysiology of tyrosinemia type II.",

This study reviews the experience with the utilization of 18F-fluoroethyl-l-tyrosine positron emission tomography (FET-PET) to define residual disease post craniotomy and optimize RT planning. METHODS: Patients with HGG and a contraindication to MRI managed with radiation therapy between 2007 and 2015 were identified. RT target volumes including gross tumour volume (GTV) defined by CT-alone and the biological target volume (BTV) defined by PET-CT were recorded. Clinical target volumes (CTV) were created from the GTV and BTV respectively using standard protocol volume expansion. The expanded BTV was termed clinical target volume biological (CTV-B). Union and intersection between CTV and CTV-B, conformity index, volumetric parameters and individual patient outcomes were analysed. RESULTS: Six patients fit study criteria. There was a mean increase in CTV-B from CTV by 31.6% with a conformity index of 0.78. Two out of six patients had FET-PET avid disease outside the constructed PTV when delineated by CT-alone. One patient with CT-only planning had a new contrast-enhancing mass within 1 month of completing RT, suggesting potential geographical miss. CONCLUSION: Patients with contraindication to MRI the addition of FET-PET can improve target volume delineation for RT Planning.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy (RT) is used to treat retinoblastoma (Rb), the most frequent ocular tumour in children. Besides eradicating the tumour, RT can cause severe side effects including secondary malignancies. This study aimed to define whether the radioprotector ortho-phospho-L-tyrosine (pTyr) prevents RT-induced side effects and affects local tumour control in a xenograft and a genetic orthotopic Rb mouse model. METHODS: B6;129-Rb1tm3Tyj/J (Rb+/-) and Y79-Rb cell-xenografted nude mice were fractionated external beam irradiated (15 fractions of 5Gy 6MV photons during 3weeks) with or without pTyr pre-treatment (100mg/kg BW, 16h prior to each irradiation). One, three, six and nine months after RT, tumour control and RT toxicity were evaluated using in vivo imaging and histology. We also analysed pTyr dependant post irradiation cell survival and p53 activity in vitro. RESULTS: In vitro pTyr pre-treatment showed no radioprotection on Y79 cells, but led to p53 stabilisation in unirradiated Y79 cells and to a facilitation of radiation-induced p21 up-regulation, confirming a modulation of p53 activity by pTyr. In both mouse models, secondary tumours were undetectable. In Rb+/- mice, pTyr significantly lowered RT-induced greying of the fur, retinal thickness reduction and photoreceptor loss. However, in the xenografted Rb model, pTyr considerably decreased RT-mediated tumour control, which was observed in 16 out of 22 control eyes but in none of the 24 pTyr treated eyes. CONCLUSIONS: In Rb+/- mice pTyr significantly prevents RT-induced greying of the fur as well as retinal degeneration. However, since non-irradiated control mice were not used in our study, a formal possibility exists that the effect shown in the retina of Rb+/- mice may be due to ageing of the animals and/or actions of pTyr alone. Unfortunately, as tested in a xenograft model, pTyr treatment reduced the control of Rb tumours.",

      "abstract": "The assessment of cerebral gliomas using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides excellent structural images but cannot solve all diagnostic problems satisfactorily. The differentiation of tumour tissue from non-neoplastic changes may be difficult especially in the post-treatment phase. In recent years, positron emission tomography (PET) using radiolabelled amino acids has gained considerable interest as an additional tool to improve the diagnosis of cerebral gliomas and brain metastases. A key step for this advancement was the development of the F-18 labelled amino acid O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) which has spread rapidly in the last decade and replaced carbon-11 labelled amino acid tracers such as 11C-methyl-L-methionine (MET) in many centres in Europe. FET can be produced with high efficiency and distributed in a satellite concept like 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG). Furthermore, FET exhibits favourable properties such as high in vivo stability, high tumour to background contrast and tissue specific tracer kinetics, which provides additional information for tumour grading or differential diagnosis. The Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) working group - an international effort to develop new standardized response criteria for clinical trials in brain tumours - has recently recommended the additional use of amino acid PET imaging for brain tumour management. FET PET can provide important diagnostic information in crucial situations such as the definition of biopsy site, the delineation of cerebral gliomas for therapy planning, sensitive monitoring of treatment response and an improved differentiation of tumour recurrence from treatment-related changes. In this article the basic information, methodological aspects and the actual status of clinical application of FET PET are reviewed.",

      "abstract": "Although considerable energy and money have been spent trying to inhibit Aβ production and its related metabolic enzyme activities, there are still no drug treatments available to cure even slow for Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, tau protein has been focused recently as the new target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The transfected human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells with or without Tau 411 plasmid were used to evaluate the effect of tau protein on cell viability. H2O2 was added to simulate microenvironment of oxidative stress (OS) during aging. N-stearoyl-l-tyrosine (Nstyr), one of the synthesized N-arachidonoylethanolamide analogues was administrated in HEK293/Tau cells during H2O2 insults. Cellular senescence and tau aberrant modification appeared after tau transfection and aggravated by H2O2 insult which detected by β-galactosidase staining analysis and western blotting analysis. The level of expression of Bcl-2 and the result of FCAS analysis indicated the appearance of cellular apoptosis. The expression of prosenescence moleculars such as p16-Rb and P53 were induced by tau transfection in HEK293 cells. Both p16-Rb and p53 senescent molecules were inhibited by Nstyr. AM251 (1 μM; an antagonist of CB1 cannabinoid receptor) or AM630 (1 μM; an antagonist of CB2 cannabinoid receptor) was used to offset the anti-senescence effects afforded by NsTyr. The anti-senescence and anti-apoptosis effect of NsTyr was completely abolished by AM630. Meanwhile, transfection of siRNACB2 was used to further confirm the above experimental results and it came out the similar results compared with AM630. Taken together, our results suggest that oxidative stress aggravates cellular senescence and apoptosis in HEK293/Tau, which can be reversed by Nstyr via CB2 receptor.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Conventional MRI is the standard method to diagnose recurrence of brain metastases after radiation. However, following radiation therapy, reactive transient blood-brain barrier alterations with consecutive contrast enhancement can mimic brain metastasis recurrence. Recent studies have suggested that O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) PET improves the correct differentiation of brain metastasis recurrence from radiation injury. Based on published evidence and clinical expert opinion, we analyzed effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the use of FET PET in addition to MRI compared with MRI alone for the diagnosis of recurrent brain metastases. METHODS: A decision-tree model was designed to compare the 2 diagnostic strategies from the perspective of the German Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) system. Effectiveness was defined as correct diagnosis of recurrent brain metastasis and was compared between FET PET with MRI and MRI alone. Costs were calculated for a baseline scenario and for a more expensive scenario. Robustness of the results was tested using sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Compared with MRI alone, FET PET in combination with MRI increases the rate of correct diagnoses by 42% (number needed to diagnose of 3) with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €2821 (baseline scenario) and €4014 (more expensive scenario) per correct diagnosis. The sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. CONCLUSIONS: The model suggests that the additional use of FET PET with conventional MRI for the diagnosis of recurrent brain metastases may be cost-effective. Integration of FET PET has the potential to avoid overtreatment with corresponding costs as well as unnecessary side effects.",

      "abstract": "Restoration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) after antiangiogenic therapy of gliomas with bevacizumab may result in a decrease in contrast enhancement on MRI despite tumor progression. This so-called pseudoresponse is difficult to differentiate from a true tumor response with conventional MRI. Initial patient studies have indicated that PET using O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine (18F-FET) may be helpful for solving this diagnostic problem. This study was performed to investigate the effects of bevacizumab on BBB permeability and 18F-FET uptake in a human xenograft model. Methods: Human U87 glioblastoma cells were implanted into the striatum of immunodeficient RNU rats. 18F-FET PET scans and ex vivo autoradiography were performed in animals receiving a single high dose of bevacizumab (45 mg/kg 2 d before PET; n = 9) or in animals receiving 2 lower doses (10 mg/kg 9 and 2 d before PET; n = 10) to evaluate short-term and long-term effects on the BBB, respectively, and in control animals without bevacizumab treatment (n = 8). Time-activity curves, slope, and tumor-to-brain ratios of 18F-FET uptake (18-61 min after injection) were evaluated using a volume-of-interest analysis. After PET scanning, Evans blue dye (EBD) was injected into animals, and cryosections of the brains were evaluated by autoradiography, by histology, and for EBD fluorescence to assess BBB permeability. Results: Compared with the control, short-term bevacizumab therapy resulted in a trend toward BBB restoration (P = 0.055) and long-term therapy resulted in a significant decrease (P = 0.004) in BBB permeability, as assessed by EBD fluorescence. In contrast, no significant differences in tumor-to-brain ratios or slope of 18F-FET uptake were observed in PET and autoradiography (P > 0.05). Conclusion:8F-FET uptake in glioblastomas seems to be largely independent of BBB permeability and reflects the viability of tumor tissue during antiangiogenic therapy more reliably than contrast-enhanced MRI.",

      "abstract": "New classes of enzymatic-biodegradable amphiphilic poly(ester-urethane)s were designed and developed from l-tyrosine amino acid resources and their self-assembled nanoparticles were employed as multiple drug delivery vehicles in cancer therapy. The amine and carboxylic acid functional groups in l-tyrosine were converted into dual functional ester-urethane monomers and they were subjected to solvent free melt polycondensation with hydrophilic polyethylene glycols to produce comb-type poly(ester-urethane)s. The phenolic unit in the l-tyrosine was anchored with hydrophobic alkyl side chain to bring appropriate amphiphilicity in the polymer geometry to self-assemble them as stable nanoscaffolds in aqueous medium. The topology of the polymer was found to play a major role on the glass transition, crystallinity, and viscoelastic rheological properties of l-tyrosine poly(ester-urethane)s. The amphiphilic polymers were self-assembled as 200 ± 10 nm nanoparticles and they exhibited excellent encapsulation capabilities for anticancer drugs such as doxorubicin (DOX) and camptothecin (CPT). In vitro drug release studies revealed that the drug-loaded l-tyrosine nanoparticles were stable at extracellular conditions and they underwent enzymatic-biodegradation exclusively at the intracellular level to release the drugs. Cytotoxicity studies in the cervical cancer (HeLa) and normal WT-MEFs cell lines revealed that the nascent l-tyrosine nanoparticles were nontoxic, whereas the CPT and DOX drug-loaded polymer nanoparticles exhibited excellent cell killing in cancer cells. Confocal microscopic imaging confirmed the cellular internalization of drug-loaded nanoparticles. The drugs were taken up by the cells much higher quantity while delivering them from l-tyrosine nanoparticle platform compared to their free state. Flow cytometry analysis showed that the DOX-loaded polymer nanoscaffolds internalized the drugs 8-10× higher compared to free DOX. Both the synthesis of new classes of poly(ester-urethane)s via melt polycondensation approach and the enzyme-responsive drug delivery concept were accomplished for the first time. Thus, the present investigation is expected to open up new opportunities for l-tyrosine polymeric materials in biomaterial and thermoplastic applications.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite an increasing number of O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (18F-FET) PET studies in supratentorial gliomas, studies regarding the usefulness of 18F-FET PET in brainstem and spinal cord gliomas to date remain scarce. METHODS: Thirty-six 18F-FET PET scans were performed in 29 patients with brainstem (n = 29 scans) or spinal cord glioma (n = 7 scans). In 32 of 36 PET scans, a dynamic acquisition was performed. Fifteen scans in 15 patients were performed to assess newly diagnosed lesions, and 21 scans were obtained during follow-up: for diagnosing tumor progression (n = 15 scans in 14 patients) as well as for treatment monitoring (n = 6 scans in 3 patients). Four patients underwent additional serial scans (range, 1-2), and 3 of these 4 patients were examined for more than one indication. Maximum and mean tumor/brain ratios (TBRmax/mean) of 18F-FET uptake (20-40 min post injection) as well as kinetic 18F-FET uptake parameters were determined. Final diagnoses were confirmed histologically (54%) or by clinical follow-up (46%). RESULTS: In all newly diagnosed high-grade (n = 3 patients) and in 5 of 11 patients with low-grade gliomas, 18F-FET uptake was increased (TBRmax ≥2.5 and/or TBRmean ≥1.9). In 2 patients with newly diagnosed gliomas without MR contrast enhancement, 18F-FET PET nevertheless showed increased metabolism. At suspected progression, the combination of TBRs with kinetic 18F-FET parameters correctly identified presence or absence of progressive disease in 9 of 11 patients (82%). CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study suggests that 18F-FET PET adds valuable diagnostic information in brainstem and spinal cord glioma, particularly when the diagnostic information derived from MRI is equivocal.",

      "abstract": "Tyrosinemia type II is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by deficiency of hepatic tyrosine aminotransferase and is associated with neurologic and development difficulties in numerous patients. Considering that the mechanisms underlying the neurological dysfunction in hypertyrosinemic patients are poorly known and that high concentrations of tyrosine provoke mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, in the present study we investigated the in vivo influence of antioxidants (N-acetylcysteine, NAC; and deferoxamine, DFX) administration on the inhibitory effects on parameters of energy metabolism in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum of rats, provoked by chronic administration of L.-tyrosine. Our results showed that chronic administration of L.-tyrosine results in a marked decrease in the activity of citrate synthase in all the analyzed structures and succinate dehydrogenase activities in hippocampus and striatum, and that antioxidants administration can prevent this inhibition in hippocampus and striatum. Moreover, chronic administration of L.-tyrosine inhibited the activity of complex I, II-III and IV in the striatum, which can be prevented by antioxidant treatment. However, the co-administration of NAC plus DFX could not prevent the inhibition of creatine kinase activity in the striatum. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that the administration of antioxidants NAC and DFX attenuates the L.-tyrosine effects on enzymes of the Krebs cycle and the mitochondrial respiratory chain, suggesting that impairment of energy metabolism can be involved with oxidative stress. These results also indicate a possible neuroprotective role for NAC and DFX as a potential adjuvant therapy to the patients with Tyrosinemia type II.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Depression has been linked to disruption in the cerebral levels of specific neurotransmitters. L-tyrosine is a precursor of more than one of the neurotransmitters affected by depression. Even though setbacks of monoamines precursors include high doses and low efficiency, many studies have suggested using L-tyrosine as antidepressant. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore the possible antidepressant effect of L-tyrosine loaded in a nanoparticle-designed formula, using behavioral tests in acute and chronic mild stress (CMS) models of depression in rats. METHODS: Animals from both models received L-tyrosine-loaded nanoparticles (5 or 10 mg/kg), L-tyrosine solution (10 mg/kg), fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) or placebo daily for 21 days. Rats from the acute stress model of depression were subjected to open field and forced swim tests (FSTs). For the CMS model, sucrose preference test was carried out. Additionally, 3 profiles of the nanoparticles formula were tested in vitro. High dissolution rate and entrapment efficiency were obtained from the in vitro tests. Moreover, L-tyrosine-loaded nanoparticles 10 mg/kg and fluoxetine 10 mg/kg significantly decreased the immobility time in the FST, concomitant with restoration of the basal levels of locomotor activity, distance travelled and rearing counts. Also, an increase of the sucrose consumption was recorded in the sucrose preference test after treatment with L-tyrosine-loaded nanoparticles 10 mg/kg and fluoxetine 10 mg/kg. RESULTS: The positive results after treatment with L-tyrosine-loaded nanoparticles, through behavioral tests, are probably attributed to restorating the basal levels of the cerebral noradrenaline. CONCLUSION: The effects of L-tyrosine administration on the cerebral levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and corticotropin-releasing factor should be further investigated."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (18F-FET) is an established tracer for the diagnosis of brain tumors with PET. This study investigates the influence of blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability on 18F-FET uptake in two rat glioma models and one human xenograft model. METHODS: F98 glioma, 9L gliosarcoma or human U87 glioblastoma cells were implanted into the striatum of 56 Fischer or RNU rats. Thereafter, animals were divided into a control group and a group receiving injections of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex). After 12-13 days of tumor growth animals received injection of Evans blue dye (EBD) to visualize BBB disturbance and underwent 18F-FET PET followed by autoradiography. Time activity curves, standardized uptake values (SUV) and Tumor-to-brain ratios (TBR) of 18F-FET uptake [18-61 min post injection (p.i.)] were evaluated using a volume-of-Interest (VOI) analysis. BBB disturbance was quantitatively evaluated by EBD fluorescence. The membrane gaps of blood vessel endothelial tight junctions were measured using electron microscopy to visualize ultrastructural BBB alterations in one untreated and one Dex treated F98 glioma. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVAs. RESULTS: In Dex treated animals EBD extravasation was significantly reduced in 9L (P < 0.001) and U87 (P = 0.008) models and showed a trend in F98 models (P = 0.053). In contrast, no significant differences of 18F-FET uptake were observed between Dex treated animals and control group except a decrease of the TBR in the 9L tumor model in PET (P < 0.01). Ultrastructural evaluation of tumor blood vessel endothelia revealed significant reduction of the cleft diameter between endothelial cells after Dex treatment in F98 model (P = 0.010). CONCLUSION: Despite a considerable reduction of BBB permeability in rat gliomas after Dex treatment, no relevant changes of 18F-FET uptake were noted in this experimental study. Thus, 18F-FET uptake in gliomas appears to be widely independent of the permeability of the BBB.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine (18F-FET) PET is a well-established method increasingly used for diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring in gliomas. Epileptic activity, frequently occurring in glioma patients, can influence MRI findings. Whether seizures also affect 18F-FET PET imaging is currently unknown. The aim of this retrospective analysis was to investigate the brain amino acid metabolism during epileptic seizures by 18F-FET PET and to elucidate the pathophysiologic background. METHODS: Ten patients with 11 episodes of serial seizures or status epilepticus, who underwent MRI and 18F-FET PET, were studied. The main diagnosis was glioma World Health Organization grade II-IV (n = 8); 2 patients suffered from nonneoplastic diseases. Immunohistochemical assessment of LAT1/LAT2/CD98 amino acid transporters was performed in seizure-affected cortex (n = 2) and compared with glioma tissues (n = 3). RESULTS: All patients exhibited increased seizure-associated strict gyral 18F-FET uptake, which was reversible in follow-up studies or negative shortly before and without any histologic or clinical signs of tumor recurrence. 18F-FET uptake corresponded to structural MRI changes, compatible with cortical vasogenic and cytotoxic edema, partial contrast enhancement, and hyperperfusion. Patients with prolonged postictal symptoms lasting up to 8 wk displayed intensive and widespread (≥ 1 lobe) cortical 18F-FET uptake. LAT1/LAT2/CD98 was strongly expressed in neurons and endothelium of seizure-affected brains and less in reactive astrocytosis. CONCLUSION: Seizure activity, in particular status epilepticus, increases cerebral amino acid transport with a strict gyral 18F-FET uptake pattern. Such periictal pseudoprogression represents a potential pitfall of 18F-FET PET and may mimic brain tumor. Our data also indicate a seizure-induced upregulation of neuronal, endothelial, and less astroglial LAT1/LAT2/CD98 amino acid transporter expression.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the potential of hybrid gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced F-fluoroethyl-L-tyrosine (F-FET) PET/MRI in distinguishing recurrence from radiation necrosis using simultaneously acquired multiple structural and functional parameters. METHODS: Twenty-six patients (5 female and 21 male patients; mean ± SD age, 51.58 ± 15.97 years) with single or multiple contrast-enhancing brain lesions (n = 32) on MRI after surgery and radiation therapy were evaluated with simultaneously acquired Gd-enhanced F-FET PET/MRI. They were then followed up with resurgery and histopathological diagnosis (n = 9) and/or clinical/MRI- or PET/MRI-based imaging follow-up (n = 17). PET/MR images were analyzed using manually drawn regions of interest over areas of maximal contrast enhancement and/or FET uptake. Maximum target-to-background ratio (TBRmax), mean target-to-background ratio (TBRmean), and choline-to-creatine (Cho/Cr) ratios as well as normalized mean relative cerebral blood volume (rCBVmean) and mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADCmean) were determined. The accuracy of each parameter individually and in various possible combinations for differentiating recurrence versus radiation necrosis was evaluated using 2-tailed independent samples Student t test, multivariate analysis of variance, and multivariate receiver operating characteristic analysis. Positive histopathological finding and long-term imaging/clinical follow-up suggestive of disease progression served as criterion standard. RESULTS: Of 26 patients, 19 were classified as recurrence, with 7 patients showing radiation necrosis. Individually, TBRmax, TBRmean, ADCmean, and Cho/Cr ratios as well as normalized rCBVmean was significant in differentiating recurrence from radiation necrosis, with an accuracy of 93.8% for TBRmax, 87.5% for TBRmean, 81.3% for ADCmean, 96.9% for Cho/Cr ratio, and 90.6% for normalized rCBVmean. The accuracy of both normalized rCBVmean and ADCmean was improved in combination with TBRmax or Cho/Cr ratio. However, TBRmax (or TBRmean) with Cho/Cr ratio yielded the highest accuracy, approaching up to 97%. Furthermore, maximum area under the curve is achieved with the combination of TBRmean, CBV, and Cho/Cr values. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that FET uptake with Cho/Cr ratio and normalized rCBVmean could be most useful to distinguish primary glioma recurrence from radiation necrosis. Hybrid simultaneous multiparametric F-FET PET/MRI might play a significant role in the evaluation of patients with suspected glioma recurrence.",

The present study deals with the elevated biochemical transformation of L-tyrosine to L-DOPA by Aspergillus niger PA2, a potent tyrosinase producer, isolated from decomposed food wastes. This appears to be the first report on A. niger as a notable extracellular tyrosinase producer. The extracellular tyrosinase activity produced remarkably higher levels of L-DOPA, i.e. 2.44 mg mL(-1) when the media was supplemented with 5 mg mL(-1) L-tyrosine. The optimum pH for tyrosinase production was 6.0, with the maximal L-DOPA production at the same pH. The product thus produced was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography, UV spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, that had denoted this to be L-DOPA. Kinetic parameters viz. Y p/s, Q s and Q p had further indicated the notable levels of production. Thus, Aspergillus niger PA2 could be a promising resource and may be further exploited for large-scale production of L-DOPA.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Pseudoprogression (PsP) is characterized by therapy-associated but not tumor growth-associated increases of contrast-enhancing glioblastoma lesions on MRI. Although typically occurring during the first 3 months after radiochemotherapy, PsP may occur later in the course of the disease and may then be particularly difficult to distinguish from true tumor progression. We explored PET using O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ((18)F-FET-PET) to approach the diagnostic dilemma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Twenty-six patients with glioblastoma that presented with increasing contrast-enhancing lesions later than 3 months after completion of radiochemotherapy underwent (18)F-FET-PET. Maximum and mean tumor/brain ratios (TBRmax and TBRmean) of (18)F-FET uptake as well as time-to-peak (TTP) and patterns of the time-activity curves were determined. The final diagnosis of true progression versus late PsP was based on follow-up MRI using RANO criteria. RESULTS: Late PsP occurred in 7 patients with a median time from radiochemotherapy completion of 24 weeks while the remaining patients showed true tumor progression. TBRmax and TBRmean were significantly higher in patients with true progression than in patients with late PsP (TBRmax 2.4 ± 0.1 vs. 1.5 ± 0.2, P = 0.003; TBRmean 2.1 ± 0.1 vs. 1.5 ± 0.2, P = 0.012) whereas TTP was significantly shorter (mean TTP 25 ± 2 vs. 40 ± 2 min, P < 0.001). ROC analysis yielded an optimal cutoff value of 1.9 for TBRmax to differentiate between true progression and late PsP (sensitivity 84%, specificity 86%, accuracy 85%, P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine PET provides valuable information in assessing the elusive phenomenon of late PsP. Clin Cancer Res; 22(9); 2190-6. ©2015 AACR.",

Data were analyzed by two-way repeated measures ANOVA and reproducibility by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS: The slope of the tumor TACs showed high reproducibility with an ICC of 0.93. A systematic increase of the TBR in the repeated scans was noted (3.7 ± 2.8 %; p < 0.01), and appeared to be related to tumor growth as indicated by a significant correlation of TBR and tumor volume (r = 0.77; p < 0.0001). After correction for tumor growth TBR showed high longitudinal stability with an ICC of 0.84. Dex treatment induced a significant decrease of the TBR (-8.2 ± 6.1 %; p < 0.03), but did not influence the slope of the tumor TAC. CONCLUSION: TBR of (18)F-FET uptake and tracer kinetics in brain tumors showed high longitudinal stability. Dex therapy may induce a minor decrease of the TBR; this needs further investigation.",

In this context, dipeptides l-tyrosine-l-tyrosine and l-tyrosine-l-arginine are synthetized to explore their application as affinity ligands for supercoiled (sc) plasmid DNA (pDNA) purification. The synthesis is based on the protection of N-Boc-l-tyrosine, followed by condensation with l-tyrosine or l-arginine methyl esters in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), which after hydrolysis and acidification give the afforded dipeptides. The supports are then obtained by coupling l-tyrosine, l-tyrosine-l-tyrosine and l-tyrosine-l-arginine to epoxy-activated Sepharose and are characterized by high resolution magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) NMR and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor is used to establish the promising ligand to be used in the chromatographic experiments and ascertain experimental conditions. Sc isoform showed the highest affinity to the dipeptides, followed by linear (ln) pDNA, being the open circular (oc) the one that promoted the lowest affinity to l-tyrosine-l-arginine. Saturation transfer difference (STD)-NMR experiments show that the interaction is mainly hydrophobic with the majority of the 5'-mononucleotides, except for 5'-GMP with l-tyrosine-l-arginine Sepharose that is mainly electrostatic. The support l-tyrosine Sepharose used in chromatographic experiments promotes the separation of native pVAX1-LacZ and pcDNA3-FLAG-p53 samples (oc+sc) by decreasing the salt concentration. The results suggest that it is possible to purify different plasmids with the l-tyrosine Sepharose, with slight adjustments in the gradient conditions.",

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 132 dynamic (18)F-FET PET and conventional MRI scans of 124 glioma patients (primary World Health Organization grade II, n = 55; grade III, n = 19; grade IV, n = 50; mean age, 52 ± 14 y). Patients had been referred for PET assessment with clinical signs and/or MRI findings suggestive of tumor progression or recurrence based on Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria. Maximum and mean tumor/brain ratios of (18)F-FET uptake were determined (20-40 min post-injection) as well as tracer uptake kinetics (ie, time to peak and patterns of the time-activity curves). Diagnoses were confirmed histologically (95%) or by clinical follow-up (5%). Diagnostic accuracies of PET and MR parameters for the detection of tumor progression or recurrence were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic analyses/chi-square test. RESULTS: Tumor progression or recurrence could be diagnosed in 121 of 132 cases (92%). MRI and (18)F-FET PET findings were concordant in 84% and discordant in 16%. Compared with the diagnostic accuracy of conventional MRI to diagnose tumor progression or recurrence (85%), a higher accuracy (93%) was achieved by (18)F-FET PET when a mean tumor/brain ratio ≥2.0 or time to peak <45 min was present (sensitivity, 93%; specificity, 100%; accuracy, 93%; positive predictive value, 100%; P < .001). CONCLUSION: Static and dynamic (18)F-FET PET parameters differentiate progressive or recurrent glioma from treatment-related nonneoplastic changes with higher accuracy than conventional MRI.",

Likewise, there has been ongoing exploration over the last few decades into the potential biological applications of carbon nanomaterials, motivated by their size, shape, structure and their unique physical and chemical properties. In recent years, the functionalization of carbon nanotubes and graphene has led to the preparation of bioactive carbon nanomaterials that are being used in biomedicine as structural elements and in gene therapy and biosensing. The present study proposes different strategies for the bonding of l-tyrosine and the homopolypeptide poly-l-tyrosine to graphene oxide nanoribbons (GONRs). The covalent attachment of l-tyrosine was undertaken by amidation of the α-amine group of tyrosine with the existing carboxylic groups in GONR and by means of esterification through phenol nucleophiles contained in their side chains. In both cases use was made of protective groups to address the functionalization with the desired reactive groups. The linking of GONRs to the PTyr was attempted according to two different strategies: either by ester bonding of commercial PTyr through its phenol side groups or by in situ ring-opening polymerization of an N-carboxyanhydride tyrosine derivative (NCA-Tyr) with Tyr-functionalized GONRs. These biofunctionalized nanomaterials were characterized by Raman and infrared spectroscopies, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, transmission electron microscopy, fluorescence and electrochemical techniques. On the basis of their properties, prospects for the potential utilization of the prepared hybrid nanomaterials in different applications are also given."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: MMP-2 enzyme is a kind of matrix metalloproteinases that digests the denatured collagens and gelatins. It is highly involved in the process of tumor invasion and has been considered as a promising target for cancer therapy. The structural requirements of an MMP-2 inhibitor are: (1) a functional group that binds the zinc ion, and (2) a functional group which interacts with the enzyme backbone and the side chains which undergo effective interactions with the enzyme subsites. METHODS: In the present study, a QSAR model was generated to screen new inhibitors of MMP-2 based on L-hydroxy tyrosine scaffold. Descriptors generation were done by Hyperchem 8, DRAGON and Gaussian98W programs. SPSS and MATLAB programs have been used for multiple linear regression (MLR) and genetic algorithm partial least squares (GA-PLS) analyses and for theoretical validation. Applicability domain of the model was performed to screen new compounds. The binding site potential of all inhibitors was verified by structure-based docking according to their binding energy and then the best inhibitors were selected. RESULTS: The best QSAR models in MLR and GA-PLS were reported, with the square correlation coefficient for leave-one-out cross-validation (Q(2) LOO) larger than 0.921 and 0.900 respectively. The created MLR and GA-PLS models indicated the importance of molecular size, degree of branching, flexibility, shape, three-dimensional coordination of different atoms in a molecule in inhibitory activities against MMP-2. The docking study indicated that lipophilic and hydrogen bonding interactions among the inhibitors and the receptor are involved in a ligand-receptor interaction. The oxygen of carbonyl and sulfonyl groups is important for hydrogen bonds of ligand with Leu82 and Ala83. R2 and R3 substituents play a main role in hydrogen bonding interactions. R1 is sited in the hydrophobic pocket. Methylene group can help a ligand to be fitted in the lipophilic pocket, so two methylene groups are better than one. The Phenyl group can create a π-π interaction with Phe86. CONCLUSIONS: The QSAR and docking analyses demonstrated to be helpful tools in the prediction of anti-cancer activities and a guide to the synthesis of new metalloproteinase inhibitors based on L-tyrosine scaffold.",

      "abstract": "In this work, a novel method based on in situ molecularly imprinted sol-gel for the surface modification of a polysulfone membrane (PSM) was developed. A modified molecularly imprinted sol-gel polysulfone membrane (MSM) was placed in a homemade plastic tube and coupled on-line with LC/MS/MS for the selective extraction and screening of l-Tyrosine (Tyr) as a tentative lung cancer biomarker in human plasma samples. The existence of molecularly imprinted sol-gel layers on both sides of a PSM was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). To evaluate the role of precursor in the extraction performance, repeatability, and selectivity of developed method, three precursors, 3-(propylmethacrylate) trimethoxysilane (P1), 3-(triethoxysilyl)-propylamine (P2), tetraethyl orthosilicate (P3), individually and together were used for treatment of PSM. Our investigation showed that a single precursor's route is more repeatable, straightforward, precise, accurate, and selective for the extraction of Tyr in plasma samples. Moreover, to achieve the best conditions and extraction efficiency, the effect of influential parameters, including the conditioning, washing, and elution of solvents, sample flow rate, loading time, desorption time, loading sample volume, salt effect, pH, and adsorption capacity for the most efficiently prepared membranes were truly investigated. The non-molecularly imprinted sol-gel polysulfone membrane (NSM) was prepared as a blank via the same process but in the absence of the Tyr. The LOD (S/N = 3/1) was 0.1 nmol L(-1) and the LOQ (S/N = 10/1) was 0.34 nmol L(-1) for Tyr in the plasma samples. The linearity for the Tyr was in the range of 0.34-2000 nmol L(-1) in the plasma samples. The coefficients of determination values were ≥0.998 for all runs. The extraction recovery was between 80%-85% for Tyr in the plasma samples. In addition, MSM could be used for up to 50 extractions without a significant change in recovery percentage.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The follow-up of glioblastoma patients after radiochemotherapy with conventional MRI can be difficult since reactive alterations to the blood-brain barrier with contrast enhancement may mimic tumour progression (i.e. pseudoprogression, PsP). The aim of this study was to assess the clinical value of O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) PET in the differentiation of PsP and early tumour progression (EP) after radiochemotherapy of glioblastoma. METHODS: A group of 22 glioblastoma patients with new contrast-enhancing lesions or lesions showing increased enhancement (>25 %) on standard MRI within the first 12 weeks after completion of radiochemotherapy with concomitant temozolomide (median 7 weeks) were additionally examined using amino acid PET with (18)F-FET. Maximum and mean tumour-to-brain ratios (TBRmax, TBRmean) were determined. (18)F-FET uptake kinetic parameters (i.e. patterns of time-activity curves, TAC) were also evaluated. Classification as PsP or EP was based on the clinical course (no treatment change at least for 6 months), follow-up MR imaging and/or histopathological findings. Imaging results were also related to overall survival (OS). RESULTS: PsP was confirmed in 11 of the 22 patients. In patients with PsP, (18)F-FET uptake was significantly lower than in patients with EP (TBRmax 1.9 ± 0.4 vs. 2.8 ± 0.5, TBRmean 1.8 ± 0.2 vs. 2.3 ± 0.3; both P < 0.001) and presence of MGMT promoter methylation was significantly more frequent (P = 0.05). Furthermore, a TAC type II or III was more frequently present in patients with EP (P = 0.04). Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the optimal (18)F-FET TBRmax cut-off value for identifying PsP was 2.3 (sensitivity 100 %, specificity 91 %, accuracy 96 %, AUC 0.94 ± 0.06; P < 0.001). Univariate survival analysis showed that a TBRmax <2.3 predicted a significantly longer OS (median OS 23 vs. 12 months; P = 0.046). CONCLUSION: (18)F-FET PET may facilitate the diagnosis of PsP following radiochemotherapy of glioblastoma.",

Screenings of critical components were completed by using a Plackett-Burman design, while further optimization was carried out using the Box-Behnken design.

      "abstract": "MicroRNAs are the most studied small non-coding RNA molecules that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of target genes. Their role in Alzheimer's disease is being studied and explored in order to develop a new therapeutic strategy based on specific gene silencing. This disease is characterized by protein deposits, mainly deposits of extracellular Aβ plaques, produced upon endoproteolytic cleavage of APP by ß-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). Recent studies have shown that particularly miR-29 cluster can be involved in the decrease of Aβ plaques production, by acting on BACE1 expression silencing. In order to use this microRNA as potential therapeutic it is essential to guarantee its purity, stability and integrity. Hence, the main purpose of this study was the development of a new affinity chromatographic strategy by using an O-phospho-l-tyrosine matrix and applying Box-Behnken design (BBD) to obtain pre-miR-29 with high purity degree and yield, envisioning its application in gene therapy. Thus, after process optimization the best results were achieved with a decreasing ammonium sulfate gradient in 10mM Tris buffer, pH 8 (1.6M (NH4)2SO4, 1.11M (NH4)2SO4 and 0M (NH4)2SO4), at 16°C. These experimental conditions allowed the recovery of pre-miR-29 with 52% of purity and 71% of recovery yield. The O-phospho-l-tyrosine matrix was initially chosen to mimic the natural interactions that occur inside the cell, and in fact it was proved a satisfactory selectivity for pre-miR-29. Also the innovative application of BBD for this strategy was efficient (R(2)=0.98 for % relative recovery and R(2)=0.93 for % relative purity) and essential to achieve best purification results in short time, saving lab resources.",

      "abstract": "Monoamine neurotransmitter deficiency has been implicated in the etiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with chronic hyperphenylalaninemia in phenylketonuria (PKU). Two proposed explanations for neurotransmitter deficiency in PKU include first, that chronically elevated blood L-phenylalanine (Phe) inhibits the transport of L-tyrosine (Tyr) and L-tryptophan (Trp), the substrates for dopamine and serotonin synthesis respectively, into brain. In the second hypothesis, elevated Phe competitively inhibits brain tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) activities, the rate limiting steps in dopamine and serotonin synthesis. Dietary supplementation with large neutral amino acids (LNAA) including Tyr and Trp has been recommended for individuals with chronically elevated blood Phe in an attempt to restore amino acid and monoamine homeostasis in brain. As a potential alternative treatment approach, we demonstrate that pharmacologic inhibition of Tyr degradation through oral administration of nitisinone (NTBC) yielded sustained increases in blood and brain Tyr, decreased blood and brain Phe, and consequently increased dopamine synthesis in a murine model of PKU. Our results suggest that Phe-mediated inhibition of TH activity is the likely mechanism of impaired dopamine synthesis in PKU. Pharmacologic inhibition of Tyr degradation may be a promising adjunct therapy for CNS monoamine neurotransmitter deficiency in hyperphenylalaninemic individuals with PKU.",

In this study Yarrowia lipolytica-NCIM 3472 biomass was used for transformation of l-tyrosine to l-DOPA. The process parameters were optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). The optimum values of the tested variables for the production of l-DOPA were: pH 7.31, temperature 42.9 °C, 2.31 g l(-1) cell mass and 1.488 g l(-1)l-tyrosine. The highest yield obtained with these optimum parameters along with recycling of the cells was 4.091 g l(-1). This optimization of process parameters using RSM resulted in 4.609-fold increase in the l-DOPA production. The statistical analysis showed that the model was significant. Also coefficient of determination (R(2)) was 0.9758, indicating a good agreement between the experimental and predicted values of l-DOPA production. The highest tyrosinase activity observed was 7,028 U mg(-1) tyrosine. l-DOPA production was confirmed by HPTLC and HPLC analysis. Thus, RSM approach effectively enhanced the potential of Y. lipolytica-NCIM 3472 as an alternative source to produce l-DOPA."

METHODS: We studied 28 patients with WHO tumor grade II-IV gliomas who were referred to our department for radiation therapy. We acquired a FET-PET in all patients, as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain consisting of at least T2-weighted imaging, flair and pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted imaging. SUVmax was measured and the tumor-to-brain uptake ratio (TBR) of all lesions was calculated based on the SUVmax (TBRmax) or SUVmean (TBRmean) of the contralateral healthy tissue. For this study, volumes were calculated using MRI alone, MRI + the volume with a SUVmax on FET-PET ≥ 2.2 as well as MRI + the volume with an uptake of at least 40 % of the SUVmax. RESULTS: Tumor volumes were a median (range) of 88.6 (2.6-467.4) ml (MRI alone), 84.2 (2.8-474.4) ml (MRI + SUVmax on FET-PET ≥ 2.2) and 101.5 (4.0-512.1) ml (MRI + FET-PET uptake ≥ 40 % SUVmax), respectively. TBR-SUVmean was 2.36 (1.46-4.08); TBR-SUVmax was 1.71 (0.97-2.85). During a follow-up of 18.7 (2.5-36.1) months after FET-PET, 12 patients died of malignant glioma. Patients with a SUVmax ≥ 2.6 had a significantly worse tumor-related mortality (p = 0.005) and progression-free survival (p = 0.038) than those with a lower SUVmax. Multivariate analysis showed that WHO tumor grade (p = 0.001) and SUVmax ≥ 2.6 (p < 0.001) were independent predictors for tumor-related mortality, but not tumor volume or TBRmax or TBRmean. SUVmax ≥ 2.6 (p = 0.007) and being treated for a recurrence rather than for a primary tumor manifestation (p = 0.014) were predictors for progression-free survival, but not TBRmax or TBRmean. CONCLUSION: In this heterogeneous patient population, higher tracer uptake in FET-PET appears to be associated with a worse tumor-related mortality and a shorter duration of the disease-free interval.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: In patients with low-grade glioma (LGG) of World Health Organization (WHO) grade II, early detection of progression to WHO grade III or IV is of high clinical importance because the initiation of a specific treatment depends mainly on the WHO grade. In a significant number of patients with LGG, however, information on tumor activity and malignant progression cannot be obtained on the basis of clinical or conventional MR imaging findings only. We here investigated the potential of O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) PET to noninvasively detect malignant progression in patients with LGG. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients (mean age ± SD, 44 ± 15 y) with histologically proven LGG (WHO grade II) were investigated longitudinally twice using dynamic (18)F-FET PET and routine MR imaging. Initially, MR imaging and PET scans were performed, and diagnosis was confirmed on the basis of biopsy. Subsequently, PET scans were obtained when clinical findings or contrast-enhanced MR imaging suggested malignant progression. Maximum and mean tumor-to-brain ratios (20-40 min after injection) (TBRmax and TBRmean, respectively) of (18)F-FET uptake as well as tracer uptake kinetics (i.e., time to peak [TTP] and patterns of the time-activity curves) were determined. The diagnostic accuracy of imaging parameters for the detection of malignant progression was evaluated by receiver-operating-characteristic analyses and by Fisher exact test for 2 × 2 contingency tables. RESULTS: In patients with histologically proven malignant progression toward WHO grade III or IV (n = 18), TBRmax and TBRmean increased significantly, compared with baseline (TBRmax, 3.8 ± 1.0 vs. 2.4 ± 1.0; TBRmean, 2.2 ± 0.3 vs. 1.6 ± 0.6; both P < 0.001), whereas TTP decreased significantly (median TTP, 35 vs. 23 min; P < 0.001). Furthermore, time-activity curve patterns changed significantly in 10 of 18 patients (P < 0.001). The combined analysis of (18)F-FET PET parameters (i.e., changes of TBRmax, TTP, or time-activity curve pattern) yielded a significantly higher diagnostic accuracy for the detection of malignant progression than changes of contrast enhancement in MR imaging (accuracy, 81% vs. 63%; P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Both tumor-to-brain ratio and kinetic parameters of (18)F-FET PET uptake provide valuable diagnostic information for the noninvasive detection of malignant progression of LGG. Thus, repeated (18)F-FET PET may be helpful for further treatment decisions.",

Considering that the mechanisms underlying the neurological dysfunction in hypertyrosinemic patients are poorly known and that studies demonstrated that high concentrations of tyrosine provoke oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo in the cerebral cortex of rats, in the present study we investigate the oxidative stress parameters (enzymatic antioxidant defenses, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and protein carbonyl content) in cerebellum, hippocampus and striatum of 30-old-day rats after acute administration of L-tyrosine. Our results demonstrated that the acute administration of L-tyrosine increased the thiobarbituric acid reactive species levels in hippocampus and the carbonyl levels in cerebellum, hippocampus and striatum. In addition, acute administration of L-tyrosine significantly decreased superoxide dismutase activity in cerebellum, hippocampus and striatum, while catalase was increased in striatum. In conclusion, the oxidative stress may contribute, along with other mechanisms, to the neurological dysfunction characteristic of hypertyrosinemia and the administration of antioxidants may be considered as a potential adjuvant therapy for tyrosinemia, especially type II.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: To date, the use of structural MR imaging (including contrast-enhanced and T2-weighted or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery-weighted images) is the standard method to diagnose tumor progression and to assess antiangiogenic treatment effects. However, several studies have suggested that O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) PET adds valuable clinical information to the information derived from structural MR imaging alone. We evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the addition of (18)F-FET PET to structural MR imaging for the management of treatment with bevacizumab and irinotecan (BEV/IR) in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma compared with MR imaging alone from the perspective of the German Statutory Health Insurance. METHODS: To evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of the additional use of (18)F-FET PET, a decision tree model was used. Effectiveness of (18)F-FET PET was defined as correct identification of both tumor progression before BEV/IR treatment initiation and BEV/IR treatment response and was evaluated for the combination of (18)F-FET PET and MR imaging compared with MR imaging alone. Costs were estimated for a baseline scenario and for a more expensive scenario. The robustness of the results was tested using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The use of (18)F-FET PET resulted in a number needed to diagnose of 2.4, that is, 3 additional patients have to be diagnosed to avoid 1 wrong diagnosis. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of (18)F-FET PET/MR imaging compared with MR imaging alone was €5,725 (€1 ≈ $1.30) for the baseline scenario and €8,145 for the more expensive scenario per additional correct diagnosis. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the results. CONCLUSION: The model suggests that the additional use of (18)F-FET PET in the management of patients with recurrent high-grade glioma treated with BEV/IR may be cost-effective. Integration of (18)F-FET PET has the potential to avoid overtreatment and corresponding costs, as well as unnecessary side effects to the patient.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: PET using O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) allows improved imaging of tumor extent of cerebral gliomas in comparison to MRI. In experimental brain infarction and hematoma, an unspecific accumulation of (18)F-FET has been detected in the area of reactive astrogliosis which is a common cellular reaction in the vicinity of cerebral gliomas. The aim of this study was to investigate possible (18)F-FET uptake in the area of reactive gliosis in the vicinity of untreated and irradiated rat gliomas. METHODS: F98-glioma cells were implanted into the caudate nucleus of 33 Fisher CDF rats. Sixteen animals remained untreated and in 17 animals the tumor was irradiated by Gamma Knife 5-8 days after implantation (2/50 Gy, 3/75 Gy, 6/100 Gy, 6/150 Gy). After 8-17 days of tumor growth the animals were sacrificed following injection of (18)F-FET. Brains were removed, cut in coronal sections and autoradiograms of (18)F-FET distribution were produced and compared with histology (toluidine blue) and reactive astrogliosis (GFAP staining). (18)F-FET uptake in the tumors and in areas of reactive astrocytosis was evaluated by lesion to brain ratios (L/B). RESULTS: Large F98-gliomas were present in all animals showing increased (18)F-FET-uptake which was similar in irradiated and non-irradiated tumors (L/B: 3.9 ± 0.8 vs. 4.0 ± 1.3). A pronounced reactive astrogliosis was noted in the vicinity of all tumors that showed significantly lower (18)F-FET-uptake than the tumors (L/B: 1.5 ± 0.4 vs. 3.9 ± 1.1). The area of (18)F-FET-uptake in the tumor was congruent with histological tumor extent in 31/33 animals. In 2 rats irradiated with 150 Gy, however, high (18)F-FET uptake was noted in the area of astrogliosis which led to an overestimation of the tumor size. CONCLUSIONS: Reactive astrogliosis in the vicinity of gliomas generally leads to only a slight (18)F-FET-enrichment that appears not to affect the correct definition of tumor extent for treatment planning.",

      "abstract": "The concept of gene therapy is promising; however, the perceived risks and side effects associated with this technology have severely dampened the researchers' enthusiasm. Thus, the development of a nonviral gene vector without immunological effects and with high transfection efficiency is necessary. Currently, most nonviral vectors have failed to achieve the in vivo transfection efficiencies of viral vectors due to their toxicity, rapid clearance, and/or inappropriate release rates. Although our previous studies have successfully demonstrated the controlled-release of plasmid DNA (pDNA) polyplexes encapsulated into nanoparticles formulated with l-tyrosine polyphosphate (LTP-pDNA nanoparticles), the in vivo transfection capabilities and immunogenicity of this delivery system have yet to be examined. Thus, we evaluate LTP-pDNA nanoparticles in an in vivo setting via injection into rodent uterine tissue. Our results demonstrate through X-gal staining and immunohistochemistry of uterine tissue that transfection has successfully occurred after a nine-day incubation. In contrast, the results for the control nanoparticles show results similar to those of shams. Furthermore, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the injected tissues confirms the transfection in vivo. To examine the immunogenicity, the l-tyrosine polyphosphate (LTP) nanoparticles have been evaluated in a mouse model. No significant differences in the activation of the innate immune system are observed. These data provide the first report for the potential use of controlled-release nanoparticles formulated from an amino acid based polymer as an in vivo nonviral vector for gene therapy.",

      "abstract": "Progress in morphological imaging has facilitated the diagnosis of low-grade glioma (LGG) and plays a decisive role in therapeutic decisions. To date, the method of choice is contrast-enhanced MRI including T1-/T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences. However, tumor delineation and the differentiation between neoplastic and normal brain tissue can be difficult when using morphological MRI and may complicate the identification of anaplastic foci for biopsy and further treatment planning. Furthermore, therapy monitoring and the differentiation of tumor recurrence from unspecific post-therapeutic changes in the tissue are challenging. Additional information about tumor metabolism may be very helpful for the diagnostic assessment of LGG and can be provided by PET. In recent years, the PET amino acid tracer O-(2-[(18)F]-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) has been clinically validated for brain tumor diagnosis. This tracer has logistical advantages over the widely used PET tracer (11)C-methyl-L-methionine due to the longer half-life of the (18)F-label (109 vs 20 minutes, respectively). Additionally, it has been demonstrated that both tracers provide comparable diagnostic information. The authors provide an overview of the recent literature regarding the value of various clinical applications of (18)F-FET PET in patients with LGG.",

METHODS: Ten patients with rHGG were treated biweekly with bevacizumab/irinotecan (BEV/IR). MR images and dynamic (18)F-FET PET scans were obtained at baseline and at follow-up after the start of treatment (median 4.9 weeks). Using MRI treatment response was evaluated according to RANO (Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology) criteria. For (18)F-FET PET evaluation, a reduction >45 % of the metabolically active tumour volume was considered as a treatment response, with the metabolically active tumour being defined as a tumour-to-brain ratio (TBR) of ≥1.6. The results of the treatment assessments were related to progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). For further evaluation of PET data, maximum and mean TBR were calculated using region-of-interest analysis at baseline and at follow-up. Additionally, (18)F-FET uptake kinetic studies were performed at baseline and at follow-up in all patients. Time-activity curves were generated and the times to peak (TTP) uptake (in minutes from the beginning of the dynamic acquisition to the maximum uptake) were calculated. RESULTS: At follow-up, MRI showed a complete response according to RANO criteria in one of the ten patients (10 %), a partial response in five patients (50 %), and stable disease in four patients (40 %). Thus, MRI did not detect tumour progression. In contrast, (18)F-FET PET revealed six metabolic responders (60 %) and four nonresponders (40 %). In the univariate survival analyses, a response detected by (18)F-FET PET predicted a significantly longer PFS (median PFS, 9 vs. 3 months; P = 0.001) and OS (median OS 23.0 months vs. 3.5 months; P = 0.001). Furthermore, in four patients (40 %), diagnosis according to RANO criteria and by (18)F-FET PET was discordant. In these patients, PET was able to detect tumour progression earlier than MRI (median time benefit 10.5 weeks; range 6-12 weeks). At baseline and at follow-up, in nonresponders TTP was significantly shorter than in responders (baseline TTP 10 ± 8 min vs. 35 ± 9 min; P = 0.002; follow-up TTP 23 ± 9 min vs. 39 ± 8 min; P = 0.02). Additionally, at baseline a kinetic pattern characterized by an early peak of (18)F-FET uptake followed by a constant descent was more frequently observed in the nonresponders (P = 0.018). CONCLUSION: Both standard and kinetic imaging parameters derived from(18)F-FET PET seem to predict BEV/IR treatment failure and thus contribute important additional information for clinical management over and above the information obtained by MRI response assessment based on RANO criteria.",

METHODS: Thirty-one patients (mean age ± SD, 53 ± 11 y) with single or multiple contrast-enhancing brain lesions (n = 40) on MRI after radiation therapy of brain metastases were investigated with dynamic (18)F-FET PET. Maximum and mean tumor-to-brain ratios (TBR(max) and TBR(mean), respectively; 20-40 min after injection) of (18)F-FET uptake were determined. Time-activity curves were generated, and the time to peak (TTP) was calculated. Furthermore, time-activity curves of each lesion were assigned to one of the following curve patterns: (I) constantly increasing (18)F-FET uptake, (II) (18)F-FET uptake peaking early (TTP ≤ 20 min) followed by a plateau, and (III) (18)F-FET uptake peaking early (TTP ≤ 20 min) followed by a constant descent. The diagnostic accuracy of the TBR(max) and TBR(mean) of (18)F-FET uptake and the curve patterns for the correct identification of recurrent brain metastasis were evaluated by receiver-operating-characteristic analyses or Fisher exact test for 2 × 2 contingency tables using subsequent histologic analysis (11 lesions in 11 patients) or clinical course and MRI findings (29 lesions in 20 patients) as reference. RESULTS: Both TBR(max) and TBR(mean) were significantly higher in patients with recurrent metastasis (n = 19) than in patients with radiation necrosis (n = 21) (TBR(max), 3.2 ± 0.9 vs. 2.3 ± 0.5, P < 0.001; TBR(mean), 2.1 ± 0.4 vs. 1.8 ± 0.2, P < 0.001). The diagnostic accuracy of (18)F-FET PET for the correct identification of recurrent brain metastases reached 78% using TBR(max) (area under the ROC curve [AUC], 0.822 ± 0.07; sensitivity, 79%; specificity, 76%; cutoff, 2.55; P = 0.001), 83% using TBR(mean) (AUC, 0.851 ± 0.07; sensitivity, 74%; specificity, 90%; cutoff, 1.95; P < 0.001), and 92% for curve patterns II and III versus curve pattern I (sensitivity, 84%; specificity, 100%; P < 0.0001). The highest accuracy (93%) to diagnose local recurrent metastasis was obtained when both a TBR(mean) greater than 1.9 and curve pattern II or III were present (AUC, 0.959 ± 0.03; sensitivity, 95%; specificity, 91%; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the combined evaluation of the TBR(mean) of (18)F-FET uptake and the pattern of the time-activity curve can differentiate local brain metastasis recurrence from radionecrosis with high accuracy. (18)F-FET PET may thus contribute significantly to the management of patients with brain metastases.",

In this study, we investigated the predictive value of PET using O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine ((18)F-FET PET) during treatment. METHODS: In a prospective study, 25 patients with glioblastoma were investigated by MRI and (18)F-FET PET after surgery (MRI-/FET-1), early (7-10 d) after completion of radiochemotherapy with temozolomide (RCX) (MRI-/FET-2), and 6-8 wk later (MRI-/FET-3). Maximum and mean tumor-to-brain ratios (TBR(max) and TBR(mean), respectively) were determined by region-of-interest analyses. Furthermore, gadolinium contrast-enhancement volumes on MRI (Gd-volume) and tumor volumes in (18)F-FET PET images with a tumor-to-brain ratio greater than 1.6 (T(vol 1.6)) were calculated using threshold-based volume-of-interest analyses. The patients were grouped into responders and nonresponders according to the changes of these parameters at different cutoffs, and the influence on progression-free survival and overall survival was tested using univariate and multivariate survival analyses and by receiver-operating-characteristic analyses. RESULTS: Early after completion of RCX, a decrease of both TBR(max) and TBR(mean) was a highly significant and independent statistical predictor for progression-free survival and overall survival. Receiver-operating-characteristic analysis showed that a decrease of the TBR(max) between FET-1 and FET-2 of more than 20% predicted favorable survival [corrected], with a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 67% (area under the curve, 0.75). Six to eight weeks later, the predictive value of TBR(max) and TBR(mean) was less significant, but an association between a decrease of T(vol 1.6) and PFS was noted. In contrast, Gd-volume changes had no significant predictive value for survival. CONCLUSION: In contrast to Gd-volumes on MRI, changes in (18)F-FET PET may be a valuable parameter to assess treatment response in glioblastoma and to predict survival time.",

The optimal process conditions found were pH 8, 2 g l⁻¹ cell mass, 2 g l⁻¹ L-tyrosine, 0.04 g l⁻¹ CuSO₄, 0.02 g l⁻¹ L-ascorbic acid, 0.5 g l⁻¹ carrageenan, and 40 °C temperature. In addition, repeated use of cells resulted in the highest yield of 3.81 g l⁻¹ (95.2%) of L-DOPA with utilization of 4 g l⁻¹ L-tyrosine, and the highest tyrosinase activity (9,201 U mg⁻¹) was observed at 18 h of incubation. Furthermore, the produced L-DOPA was confirmed by high-performance thin-layer chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Kinetic studies showed significant values of Y (p/s), Q (s), and q (s) after optimization of the process. Thus, Brevundimonas sp.

METHODS: Seventeen low-grade (WHO I-II) and 15 high-grade (WHO III-IV) gliomas were studied with dynamic F-18 FET PET. Regions of interests were drawn over the tumor and contralateral brain, and TACs were analyzed. We considered early standardized uptake value (SUV), middle SUV, late SUV, early-to-middle SUV tumor ratio, early-to-late SUV tumor ratio; time to peak (Tpeak), in minutes, from the beginning of the dynamic acquisition up to the maximum SUV of the tumor; and SoD (sum of the frame-to-frame differences). To assess the individual probability of high-grade, logistic regression was also used. RESULTS: High-grade gliomas showed significantly (P < 0.0001) higher values when compared with low-grade gliomas in early SUV, early-to-middle ratio, early-to-late ratio, Tpeak, and SoD. For the grading of gliomas, the best indices were early-to-middle ratio and Tpeak providing a diagnostic accuracy of 94%. TACs analysis provided an 87% diagnostic accuracy. For individual high-grade diagnosis, the logistic regression provided 93% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and 97% accuracy. CONCLUSION: Early-to-middle SUV tumor ratio and Tpeak were the best indices for assessing the grading of gliomas. Since early-to-middle ratio derives from the first 35 minutes of the dynamic acquisition, the PET study could last half an hour instead of 1 hour. By logistic regression, it is possible to assess the individual probability of high-grade, useful for prognosis and treatment.",

METHODS: Eleven patients with rHGG were treated biweekly with bevacizumab-irinotecan. MR images and (18)F-FET PET scans were obtained at baseline and at follow-up 8-12 wk after treatment onset. MRI treatment response was evaluated by T1/T2 volumetry according to response assessment in neurooncology (RANO) criteria. For (18)F-FET PET evaluation, an uptake reduction of more than 45% calculated with a standardized uptake value of more than 1.6 was defined as a metabolic response (receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis). MRI and (18)F-FET PET volumetry results and response assessment were compared with each other and in relation to progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: At follow-up, MR images showed partial response in 7 of 11 patients (64%), stable disease in 2 of 11 patients (18%), and tumor progression in 2 of 11 patients (18%). In contrast, (18)F-FET PET revealed 5 of 11 metabolic responders (46%) and 6 of 11 nonresponders (54%). MRI and (18)F-FET PET showed that responders survived significantly longer than did nonresponders (10.24 vs. 4.1 mo, P = 0.025, and 7.9 vs. 2.3 mo, P = 0.015, respectively). In 4 patients (36.4%), diagnosis according to RANO criteria and (18)F-FET PET was discordant. In these cases, PET was able to detect tumor progression earlier than was MRI. CONCLUSION: In rHGG patients undergoing antiangiogenic treatment, (18)F-FET PET seems to be predictive for treatment failure in that it contributes important information to response assessment based solely on MRI and RANO criteria.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: L-[methyl-(11)C]methionine (MET)-positron emission tomography (PET) has a high sensitivity and specificity for imaging of gliomas and metastatic brain tumors. The short half-life of (11)C (20 minutes) limits the use of MET-PET to institutions with onsite cyclotron. O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) is labeled with (18)F (half-life, 120 minutes) and could be used much more broadly. This study compares the uptake of FET and MET in gliomas and metastases, as well as treatment-induced changes. Furthermore, it evaluates the gross tumor volume (GTV) of gliomas defined on PET and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS AND MATERIALS: We examined 42 patients with pretreated gliomas (29 patients) or brain metastases (13 patients) prospectively by FET- and MET-PET on the same day. Uptake of FET and MET was quantified by standardized uptake values. Imaging contrast was assessed by calculating lesion-to-gray matter ratios. Tumor extension was quantified by contouring GTV in 17 patients with brain gliomas. Gross tumor volume on PET was compared with GTV on MRI. Sensitivity and specificity of MET- and FET-PET for differentiation of viable tumor from benign changes were evaluated by comparing the PET result with histology or clinical follow-up. RESULTS: There was a strong linear correlation between standardized uptake values calculated for both tracers in cortex and lesions: r = 0.78 (p = 0.001) and r = 0.84 (p < 0.001), respectively. Image contrast was similar for MET- and FET-PET (lesion-to-gray matter ratios of 2.36 ± 1.01 and 2.33 ± 0.77, respectively). Mean GTV in 17 glioma patients was not significantly different on MET- and FET-PET. Both MET- and FET-PET delineated tumor tissue outside of MRI changes. Both tracers provided differentiated tumor tissue and treatment-related changes with a sensitivity of 91% at a specificity of 100%. CONCLUSIONS: O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine-PET and MET-PET provide comparable diagnostic information on gliomas and brain metastases. Like MET-PET, FET-PET can be used for differentiation of residual or recurrent tumor from treatment-related changes/pseudoprogression, as well as for delineation of gliomas.",
