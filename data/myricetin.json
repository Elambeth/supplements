      "abstract": "The development of new strategies to raise the survival and viability of transplanted mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is very important for the therapeutic potential of stem cells. The natural flavonoid myricetin has anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects. The effects of myricetin on human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (HUC-MSCs) induced oxidative stress with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunocytochemistry (ICC) staining. Myricetin showed an increase in the number of live cells, a decrease in caspase-3 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) ICC staining intensity, an increase in the translocase of the mitochondrial inner membrane 17 (TIM17) ICC staining intensity, and a decrease in degeneration of cell ultrastructure in TEM against oxidative stress damage in HUC-MSCs. The results suggest that myricetin prevents oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and inflammation in the HUC-MSCs. Myricetin can be combined with HUC-MSCs in cell culture and considered as a supportive alternative treatment option."

      "abstract": "Myricetin (ME) is a major constituent of various foods and beverages consumed by humans, including vegetables, teas and fruits, and is primarily recognized for its iron-chelating, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. This study evaluated the cytostatic, genotoxic, and chemopreventive effects of ME in CHO-K1 cells using the Cytokinesis-Block Micronucleus (CBMN) assay and explored molecular interactions through in silico systems biology analysis. CHO-K1 cells were exposed to ME (2.5-40 µM). Cytostasis was assessed by the Cytokinesis-Block Proliferation Index (CBPI), and chromosomal instability was measured by the frequency of micronuclei (MNi), nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs), and nuclear buds (NBUDs). ME at 40 µM significantly reduced CBPI, while concentrations of 20 and 40 µM increased chromosomal instability (p < 0.05). For chemoprevention, ME (2.5-10 µM) was administered in pre-, co-, and post-treatment with bleomycin (BLM). ME significantly reduced BLM-induced MNi and NPBs in all protocols (p < 0.05). In silico analysis revealed strong interactions between ME and key proteins related to DNA damage response, apoptosis, and bleomycin detoxification. Notably, the in silico analysis revealed a strong association between ME and bleomycin hydrolase (BLMH) and the interaction of ME with proteins related to DNA damage response and apoptosis regulation. Overall, ME exhibited genotoxicity at high concentrations but demonstrated a significant chemopreventive effect at lower, nontoxic doses. These findings provide insights into the dual biological activity of ME and support its potential use as a protective agent against genotoxic damage."

      "abstract": "Myricetin (Myr), a flavonoid present in vegetables and fruits, has been shown to ameliorate inflammation and oxidative stress in various disease models. However, the effects of Myr on hyperlipidemic tenocytes have not been studied. Herein, we aimed to investigate the effects of Myr on the features of tendinopathy in cultured tenocytes under hyperlipidemic conditions. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by DCFDA. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malondialdehyde (MDA), and caspase 3 activity were quantified via matched assay kits. Apoptotic cells were detected via TUNEL staining. Proteins investigated in this study were evaluated through Western blotting. Treatment with Myr enhanced tenocyte migration and prevented apoptosis, inflammation and oxidative stress in palmitate-treated tenocytes. Myr treatment increased the phosphorylation of AMPK, and the expression of PGC1α and FGF2. siRNA targeting AMPK abrogated the effects of Myr on palmitate-treated tenocytes. However, FGF2 siRNA reduced the impacts of Myr on only cell migration and ECM signaling. These in vitro results suggest that Myr promotes tenocyte migration and ECM signaling via AMPK/FGF2 signaling and attenuates apoptosis through the AMPK-mediated suppression of inflammation and oxidative stress in hyperlipidemic tenocytes. This study sheds light on therapeutic strategies for treating obesity-related tendinopathy.",

This study explores the protective effect of vitamin C on the thermal degradation of myricetin and its mechanism of action. O-phenylenediamine derivatization identified reactive ortho-quinone intermediates, while density functional theory (DFT) calculations (ΔG = -47.74 kcal/mol) confirmed the redox mechanism. Vitamin C significantly improved myricetin retention from 32.8 % to 91.4 % in 0.8 mM after 100 min of heating, outperforming nitrogen treatment. Myricetin degradation begins with oxidation to ortho-quinones, which further degrades into phenolic acids and aldehydes. Vitamin C not only inhibited this process but also reversed oxidation by reducing ortho-quinones back to myricetin. These findings highlight vitamin C's potential to enhance flavonoid stability and bioavailability in functional heat-processed foods.",

The flavonoid myricetin was reported to exert protective effects in different diseases. This study aimed to explore the function of myricetin in COPD progression. Airway epithelial A549 cells were treated with CS extract (CSE) to establish an in vitro model, followed by the detection of inflammation, oxidative stress, and autophagy markers. Sprague-Dawley male rats were exposed to CS for 12 weeks to establish an in vivo model, followed by the evaluation of lung function parameters and lung histopathological changes. We found that myricetin relieved inflammation and oxidative stress in CSE-induced A549 cells, as demonstrated by the reduced MCP-1, IL-6, and IL-8 expression, ROS production, and MDA content and elevated SOD activity. Myricetin treatment reduced LC3B-II/LC3B-I ratio and Beclin-1 protein levels and elevated p62 protein level after CSE stimulation in A549 cells. In vivo results revealed that myricetin restored pulmonary function and ameliorated pulmonary inflammation and emphysema in CS-induced COPD rats. Collectively, the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of myricetin in COPD may be attributed to its suppressive effects on autophagy.",

This study aimed to explore whether administering MYR intravenously, in acute doses, to rats, diminishes the excitability of SpVc wide-dynamic range (WDR) spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis (SpVc) neurons in response to nociceptive and non-nociceptive mechanical stimulation in vivo. Recordings of extracellular single units were obtained from SpVc neurons when orofacial mechanical stimulation was applied to anesthetized rats. The average firing rate of SpVc WDR neurons, to both non-noxious and noxious mechanical stimuli, was significantly and dose-dependently inhibited by MYR (1-5 mM, intravenously), and the maximum reversible inhibition of the discharge frequency, for both non-noxious and noxious mechanical stimuli, occurred within 5-10 min. The suppressive effects of MYR continued for about 20 min. These findings indicate that an acute, intravenous administration of MYR reduces the SpVc nociceptive transmission, likely through the inhibition of the CaV channels and by activating the Kv channels. Therefore, MYR might be utilized as a treatment for trigeminal nociceptive pain, without causing side effects.",

This study aimed to investigate the effects of myricetin (MYR) on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- mice. Our findings demonstrated that MYR treatment significantly reduced the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, particularly at a high dose of 100 mg kg-1 day-1. Additionally, MYR markedly attenuated lipid metabolism disorders in ApoE-/- mice by decreasing body weight, improving serum lipid profiles, and reducing lipid deposition. Analysis of 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that MYR treatment enhanced the abundance of probiotic g_Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136, while it reduced that of obesity-associated genera, including Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group and Alistipes. Metabolomic analysis and RT-qPCR tests indicated that MYR upregulated hepatic bile acid biosynthesis, evidenced by increased total bile acid levels and enhanced expression of key enzymes CYP7A1 and CYP8B1, particularly through the classical biosynthetic pathway. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed strong associations between the regulated bile acids and these aforementioned bacteria. Therefore, our results demonstrated that MYR exerts an anti-atherosclerotic effect by modulating the gut-liver axis.",

Myricetin, a flavonoid compound widely distributed in natural plants, has demonstrated multiple biological functions in combating diseases such as cancer and inflammation. In this research, we explored the mechanism of myricetin against HBV replication. We employed various experiments such as ELISA, Southern Blot, Northern Blot, Western Blot, RT-qPCR, Dual luciferase reporter gene assay, ChIP, EMSA, IHC, Immunofluorescence, AAV infection, and isolation of primary human hepatocytes (PHH) in this study. Our results showed that myricetin significantly reduced the expression of HBV markers, including HBsAg, HBeAg and covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), in HepG2-NTCP cells and PHH. We further confirmed these findings using AAV-HBV cell and mouse models. Furthermore, we found that myricetin significantly downregulated HBV SP2 promoter activity. Mechanistically, myricetin reduced CEBPA expression, which in turn interfered with the binding of CEBPA to the HBV SP2 promoter, leading to an antiviral effect. In conclusion, myricetin exhibited promising antiviral activity against HBV, suggesting its potential for novel HBV treatment.",

      "abstract": "Sevoflurane anaesthesia induces neurotoxicity and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) after surgery. This study investigated the roles and potential mechanisms of the natural flavonoid myricetin in sevoflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction. Primary hippocampal neurons were treated with 3% sevoflurane to establish a neuron injury model. Neurons was pre-treated with different concentrations of myricetin, and ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) was used as a positive control. Moreover, mice were anaesthetised with 3% sevoflurane to establish an in-vivo model, and they were pre-treated with 50 or 100 m/kg myricetin. Cell viability and death were determined. Ferroptosis-related markers, including intracellular iron content, reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) protein levels were measured. Myricetin treatment enhanced cell viability and mitigated sevoflurane-induced cell death in the hippocampal neurons. Sevoflurane exposure increased the ROS, MDA and 4-HNE levels and reduced the GSH level, whereas myricetin treatment abrogated these effects. Meanwhile, myricetin treatment restrained sevoflurane-induced increase in intracellular iron content and GPX4 and SLC7A11 protein levels. A high dose of myricetin showed distinct protective effects. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that myricetin treatment reversed sevoflurane-induced histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) upregulation and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) deacetylation, thus activating the Nrf2/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) signalling. Myricetin treatment mitigated sevoflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction in aged mice by inhibiting hippocampal ferroptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction via the HDAC2/Nrf2/HO-1 signalling pathway. Myricetin may be a treatment option for POCD after surgery."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The process of B cell activation and plasma cell (PC) formation involves morphological, transcriptional, and metabolic changes in the B cell. Blocking or reducing PC differentiation is one approach to treat autoimmune diseases that are characterized by the presence of pathogenic autoantibodies. Recent studies have suggested the potential of myricetin, a natural flavonoid with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, to block or reduce PC differentiation. METHODS: Primary human B cells were purified by using a human B cell isolation kit. B cell subsets such as IgG memory B cells, marginal zone B cells (MZ B cells), and naive B cells were isolated by flow cytometry and activated to induce PC differentiation. Quantification of PCs (CD27 + + , CD38 +) was obtained by flow cytometry. The expression of mRNA was measured by qPCR. Ig secretion in culture supernatant was measured by ELISA. RESULTS: Myricetin treatment significantly reduced PC differentiation in primary human B cells and all B cell subsets. Myricetin exposure reduced Ig production both IgM and IgG, in culture supernatants at day 5. Myricetin treatment led to augmented BACH2 expression and reduced IRF4, BLIMP1, and XBP1 expression compared to control cultures. CONCLUSION: Myricetin treatment reduced PC differentiation and Ig secretion by primary human B cells. Targeting B cells in this way may be a therapeutic approach for some autoimmune diseases.",

Until now, there has no research on the determination of sulfatinib in biological medium by ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method. METHODS: The current study validated a sensitive and reliable quantitative detection of sulfatinib in plasma using UPLC-MS/MS for the first time, and investigated the interaction with myricetin in rats. Acetonitrile was used to precipitate the plasma protein, and lenvatinib was employed as the internal standard (IS). RESULTS: The method demonstrated that sulfatinib presented high linearity over the concentration of 11-2,000 ng/mL with the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 1 ng/mL. It was validated methodologically that the precision, matrix effect, stability, accuracy and extraction recovery were all within the allowable values. Moreover, male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were assigned randomly to assess the interaction between sulfatinib (30 mg/kg) and myricetin (50 mg/kg). Nevertheless, no significant differences of the main pharmacokinetic parameters were revealed. This may be due to insufficient doses of myricetin, or failure of myricetin to act in a timely manner in vivo. DISCUSSION: The findings contributed to a better understanding of the metabolism and drug-drug interaction of sulfatinib, but the presence or absence of interactions needs to be confirmed by further studies."

      "abstract": "Myricetin, a flavonoid present in numerous fruits, vegetables, and medicinal plants, is recognized for its potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer activities. Nevertheless, its involvement in mitigating inflammation caused by the endocrine-disrupting chemical Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), commonly used in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) manufacturing to improve flexibility, has not been investigated. Here, we found that DEHP markedly increased IL-1β production through inflammatory pathways in RAW 264.7 murine macrophages. Treatment with myricetin at a concentration of 10 μM significantly reduced the elevated IL-1β levels. Myricetin achieves this by inhibiting the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which are driven by reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby suppressing IL-1β transcription via nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). Additionally, myricetin prevents ROS-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent caspase-1 activation, further decreasing IL-1β production. These dual actions highlight myricetin's therapeutic potential in countering the oxidative stress-mediated inflammatory pathways triggered by environmental toxins like DEHP.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Long-term inhalation of silica dust particles leads to lung tissue fibrosis, resulting in impaired gas exchange and increased mortality. Silica inhalation triggers the aging of epithelial cells (AECs), which is a key contributor to the development of pulmonary fibrosis. Myricetin, a flavonoid compound extracted from Myrica genus plants, possesses various biological activities, including antioxidant and immunomodulatory effects. However, the mechanisms underlying myricetin's ability to counter senescence and fibrosis need to be further studied. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: In vivo, the antifibrotic and anti-senescence effects of myricetin were evaluated using a silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model. To further elucidate the mechanisms by which myricetin counteracts silica-induced senescence, in vitro experiments were conducted using AECs. RESULTS: Our studies revealed that myricetin treatment alleviated silica-induced mortality, improved lung function, and reduced the severity of pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Immunofluorescence analysis suggests its potential in mitigating senescence of AECs. Under laboratory conditions, myricetin intervened in the cellular senescence pathway induced by silica dust by modulating mitochondrial function. It acted through the PPARγ-PGC1α axis, effectively reducing silica-induced mitochondrial oxidative stress in AECs, promoting mitophagy, and maintaining mitochondrial dynamics. However, the efficacy of myricetin was reversed under PPARγ siRNA intervention. Additionally, myricetin exhibited an enhancing effect on PPARγ and autophagy in animal models. Treatment with PPARγ and PGC-1α siRNA elucidated the role of myricetin in promoting the formation of a positive feedback loop between PPARγ and PGC-1α. Additionally, the PPARγ inhibitor GW9662 verified the in vivo effects of myricetin. CONCLUSIONS: Myricetin activates PPARγ, forming a PPARγ-PGC-1α loop, which promotes mitophagy and maintains mitochondrial dynamics. This alleviates epithelial cell senescence induced by silica exposure, consequently mitigating silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice.",

      "abstract": "AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Anaplastic thyroid cancer cells lack the capacity to effectively accumulate iodine and are therefore unresponsive to treatment with radioactive iodine. The main objective of this study was to examine the possible therapeutic effects of Myricetin on the SW1736 ATC cell line. In this study, we assessed the influence of Myricetin on iodide absorption, sodium iodide symporter gene expression, and apoptosis induction. MATERIAL METHODS: The interaction between the 7UUY protein of NIS and Myricetin was investigated using AutoDock Vina. Assessment of cell viability was conducted with the MTT assay, whereas cell apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry using the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection kit. A spectrophotometric test based on the Sandell-Kolthoff reaction was conducted to assess the absorption of iodide by SW1736 cells. QRT-PCR analyses were used to assess the expression levels of NIS mRNA in SW1736 cells. RESULTS: The hydrogen bond interaction pattern created by PyMOL revealed the interactions between the target and ligand molecules. The results demonstrated that Myricetin-induced cell death is dependent on apoptosis in this type of thyroid cancer cell line. QRT-PCR analyses revealed significantly higher NIS mRNA (P < 0.001) levels in the Myricetin-treated group than in the non-treated group. Furthermore, Myricetin treatment significantly increased iodide uptake (P value = 0.0053) in the SW1736 thyroid cancer cell line compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that Myricetin has potential as a therapeutic agent by promoting growth inhibition, enhancing NIS gene expression, and increasing iodide uptake in SW1736 cells. Additional research is necessary to clarify the fundamental mechanisms and to evaluate the efficacy of Myricetin in preclinical and clinical settings.",

The CD spectra also demonstrated maximum denaturation of Hb at pH 5.0 evidencing the opening of the Hb hydrophobic core. The acidic condition at pH 5.0 is optimized for the synthesis of drug- encapsulated NPs. FTIR spectra of Hb PTX NPs recorded higher shifts in the OH/carboxyl peak compared to Hb-MYN. SEM images of Hb-PTX NPs highlight the tetrahedral structure of the NPs and the round shape of Hb-MYN NPs. The size of Hb-MYN and Hb-PTX is around 38.0 and 44.0 nm respectively as measured by DLS.

      "abstract": "Citrus flavonoids are group of bioactive polyphenols. Here, we investigated the potential of diosmin, myricetin and neohesperidin as possible inhibitors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This bacterium is a major clinical challenge due to its propensity to form resistant biofilm. The aims of this study were to examine flavonoids antibacterial activity using the microdilution method, assays intended to determine several antibiofilm mechanisms (crystal violet, congo red binding, extracellular DNA (eDNA) test and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) live/dead cell imaging), followed by virulence genes RT-qPCR analysis. Furthermore, we aimed to examine in vivo toxicity of the compounds as well as their efficacy in P. aeruginosa zebrafish embryo infection model. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of tested flavonoids towards P. aeruginosa were in range 0.05 - 0.4 mg/mL. A high potential of the compounds to disturb both the formation of the bacterial biofilm and its eradication was recorded, including significant reduction in biofilm biomass, exopolysaccharide and eDNA production. Biofilm treatment with diosmin resulted in the lowest percentage of live microbial cells as observed in the CLSM live/dead cell imaging. The lasI, pvdS, and rhlC genes were found to be downregulated in the presence of diosmin and myricetin. Only diosmin stood out as non-embryotoxic. Consequently, in vivo analysis using a zebrafish model of P. aeruginosa infection showed an antivirulence effect of diosmin. Our findings suggest that diosmin could be potential candidate for the development of new agent that target P. aeruginosa infections by reducing its virulence mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Spinal cord injury (SCI), one of the major disabilities concerning central nervous system injury, results in permanent tissue loss and neurological impairment. The existing therapeutic options for SCI are limited and predominantly consist of chemical compounds. In this study, we delved into the neuroprotective effects of myricetin, a natural flavonoid compound, and the underlying mechanisms, specifically in the context of SCI, utilizing an in vivo model. Previously, our investigations revealed an elevation in the phosphorylated form of Lin-11, Isl-1, and Mec-3 kinase1 (LIMK1) at chronic time points postinjury, coinciding with neuronal loss and scar formation. Our primary objective here was to assess the potential neuroprotective properties of myricetin in SCI and to ascertain if these effects were linked to LIMK inhibition, a hitherto unexamined pathway to date. METHODS: Computational docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies were performed to assess myricetin's potential to bind with LIMK. Then, using a rat contusion model, SCI was induced and different molecular techniques (Western blot, Evans Blue assay, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry) were performed to determine the effects of myricetin. RESULTS: Remarkably, computational docking models identified myricetin as having a better interaction profile with LIMK than standard. Subsequent to myricetin treatment, a significant downregulation in phosphorylated LIMK expression was observed at chronic time points. This reduction correlated with a notable decrease in glial and fibrotic scar formation, and enhanced neuroprotection indicating a positive outcome in vivo. CONCLUSION: In summary, our findings underscore myricetin's potential as a bioactive compound capable of attenuating SCI-induced injury cascades by targeting the LIMK pathway."

      "abstract": "Myricetin (MYR) is a natural flavonoid that has several biological functions. However, some of its beneficial effects are diminished due to low water solubility, stability, and bioavailability. Herein, several kinds of silica nanoparticles (MCM-41 and SBA-15) were loaded with MYR to improve its biological activity as an analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory component, thereby overcoming its drawbacks. The nanoparticles (MYR@SBA-15) were formulated optimally, transforming MYR into an amorphous state. This transformation was confirmed via several strategies, including differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and powder x-ray diffraction. As a result, there was a significant enhancement in the solubility and rate of dissolution in water. The anti-inflammatory benefits as an innovative strategy and the underlying mechanism of action of MYR and its SBA-15 silica nanoparticles (MYR@SBA-15) were investigated based on the biochemical, histological, immunohistochemical, and metabolomic assays alongside their antipyretic and analgesic characteristics. Compared to the usage of raw MYR, the administration of MYR@SBA-15 at doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg significantly decreases pain perception by inhibiting the body's writhing motions induced by acetic acid. Furthermore, it helps regulate increased body temperature caused by baking yeast and effectively stabilizes it. It reduces the release of NO and PGE-2 in a concentration-dependent manner by down-regulating iNOS and COX-2 expression in the inflammatory model. MYR and MYR@SBA-15 also inhibit the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, downregulate the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), such as p38, ERK1/2, and JNK protein, and reduce the generation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α. In addition, inflammatory cardinal signs like paw edema caused by carrageenan in rats are greatly suppressed by MYR and MYR@SBA-15 treatment when compared to the untreated group. More noteworthy outcomes are shown in the MYR@SBA-15, particularly at a dose of 100 mg/kg. These results of biochemical and immuno-histochemistry suggest that MYR@SBA-15 may be a useful analgesic antipyretic and may also help reduce inflammation by altering MAPKs/NF-κB and COX-2/PGE-2 signaling cascades. Serum metabolomics study demonstrated modifications in various low molecular weight metabolites with arthritis development. These metabolite levels were restored to normal when MYR@SBA-15 was administered via modulating several metabolic pathways, i.e., pyrimidine, energy metabolism, and proteins. Overall, MYR-loaded SBA-15 silica nanoparticles have demonstrated significant promise in enhancing the disturbed metaboloic pathways and providing a substantial capacity to regulate several oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators.",

However, its limited bioactivity due to its short lifespan and poor solubility in water has been a challenge. The current research focuses on incorporating myricetin into alginate-cellulose hybrid nanocrystals to enhance its selective proapoptotic effects on human AGS gastric cancer cells. METHODS: MAC-NCs, myricetin-loaded alginate-cellulose hybrid nanocrystals, were synthesized using a combined co-precipitation/ultrasonic homogenization method and characterized through Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM), and Zeta-potential analyses. Their cytotoxic activity was tested on cancerous (AGS) and normal (Huvec) cells, revealing selective toxicity. Apoptotic markers, Caspase 8 and Caspase 9, gene expression was measured, and cell death type was confirmed using DAPI staining and flow cytometry on AGS cells. RESULTS: Synthesized MAC-NCs, measuring 40 nm, showed significant selective toxicity on human gastric cells (IC50 of 31.05 µg/mL) compared to normal endothelial cells (IC50 of 214.26 µg/mL). DAPI and annexin flow cytometry revealed increased apoptotic bodies in gastric cells, indicating apoptosis. However, the apoptosis was found to be independent of Caspase-8 and Caspase-9. CONCLUSION: The current study provides critical insights into the therapeutic potential of MAC-NCs for gastric cancer treatment. Based on the notable induction of apoptosis in the AGS cancer cell line, the synthesized MAC-NCs exhibit promising potential as a selective anti-gastric cancer agent. However, further in-vivo studies are necessary to confirm and quantify the nanoparticle's selective toxicity and pharmaceutical properties in future investigations.",

PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate the possibility that myricetin improves airway remodeling by activating Sirt1 and has potential as a new treatment for asthma. METHODS: RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and co-cultured with 3T6 cells in vitro to simulate the in vivo effects of inflammation on airway remodeling. Using an ovalbumin-induced chronic asthma mouse model, we compared changes in inflammatory factors and airway remodeling-related factors under treatment with myricetin and/or the Sirt1 inhibitor EX-527 using western blotting and quantitative PCR. Expression plasmids carrying Smad3 site mutations were transfected into 3T6 cells to identify the Sirt1 deacetylation site on Smad3 protein. RESULTS: Myricetin significantly reduced the infiltration of airway inflammatory cells and the production of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-5, and inhibited mucus secretion by goblet cells, collagen fiber proliferation, and the increase in inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from asthmatic mice. Results of in vitro experiments were consistent with those conducted in vivo. Exploring the mechanism of action of myricetin, we found that myricetin downregulated the levels of phosphorylated (p)-JNK, p-Smad3, and acetylated Smad3 proteins by activating Sirt1 both in vivo and in vitro. K341 was identified as the main deacetylation site of Smad3 by myricetin-activated Sirt1. CONCLUSION: Myricetin ameliorates airway inflammation and remodeling in asthma by activating Sirt1 to regulate the JNK/Smad3 pathway.",

This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of a treatment in reducing circulating ethanol and oxidative stress biomarkers. METHODS: Twenty wine-drinking subjects were investigated in a randomized controlled, single-blind trial (ClinicalTrials.gov. Identifier: NCT06548503; Ethical Committee of the University of Padova (HEC-DSB/12-2023) to evaluate the effect of the intake of a product containing silymarin, pyrroloquinoline quinone sodium salt, and myricetin (referred to as Si.Pi.Mi. for this project) on blood alcohol, ethyl glucuronide (EtG: marker for alcohol consumption) and markers of oxidative stress levels (Reactive Oxygen Species-ROS, Total Antioxidant Capacity-TAC, CoQ10, thiols redox status, 8-isoprostane, NO metabolites, neopterin, and uric acid). The effects of the treatment versus placebo were evaluated acutely and after 1 week of supplementation in blood and/or saliva and urine samples. RESULTS: Si.Pi.Mi intake reduced circulating ethanol after 120 min (-33%). Changes in oxidative stress biomarkers, particularly a TAC (range +9-12%) increase and an 8-isoprostane (marker of lipidic peroxidation) decrease (range -22-27%), were observed too. CONCLUSION: After the administration of Si.Pi.Mi, the data seemed to suggest a better alcohol metabolism and oxidative balance in response to wine intake. Further verification is requested.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN), a leading cause of end-stage renal disease, remains a formidable challenge in diabetes management due to the complex nature of its pathogenesis, particularly the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Our innovative study leverages network pharmacology to explore the therapeutic potentials of Myricetin, a natural flavonoid, focusing on its effects against NOX4, a critical mediator in DN progression. This investigation marks a pioneering approach by integrating network pharmacology to predict and elucidate the inhibitory relationship between Myricetin and NOX4. Utilizing a high-fat diet/streptozotocin (HFD/STZ) induced DN mouse model, we delved into the effects of Myricetin on renal EMT processes. Through network pharmacology analyses coupled with molecular docking studies, we identified and confirmed Myricetin's binding efficacy to NOX4. Extensive in vitro and in vivo experiments further established Myricetin's significant impact on mitigating EMT by modulating the NOX4-NF-κB-Snail signaling pathway. Results from our research demonstrated notable improvements in renal function and reductions in tissue fibrosis among treated HFD/STZ mice. By curtailing NOX4 expression, Myricetin effectively reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, thereby inhibiting NF-κB activation and subsequent Snail expression, crucial steps in the EMT pathway. Supported by both theoretical predictions and empirical validations, this study unveils the mechanism underlying Myricetin's modulation of EMT in DN through disrupting the NOX4-NF-κB-Snail axis. These findings not only contribute a new therapeutic avenue for DN treatment but also underscore the utility of network pharmacology in advancing drug discovery processes."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Arsenic (ARS) is a toxic heavy metal that poses a significant concern for both animal and human health. AIM: The study investigated the ameliorative effect of myricetin (MRC) against arsenic-induced immune dysfunction, oxidative stress, hematological changes, hepatic and renal injuries, and inflammatory gene expression in rats. METHODS: Rats were divided into 4 groups: the control group (CON) received orally administered distilled water (1 ml/rat), and the ARS group received 10 mg/kg orally, the MRC group received 5 mg of MRC/kg orally, and the co-treated group (ARS+MRC) received 10 mg/kg of ARS and 5 mg/kg b.w. of MRC orally. RESULTS: The results showed that co-treatment of ARS-exposed rats with MRC significantly corrected erythrocyte parameters (except MCV) and leukocyte parameters (except basophils; p < 0.05). Furthermore, the ARS group significantly reduced total proteins and globulins while significantly increasing liver functions and uric acid levels (p < 0.05). Co-administration with MRC significantly mitigated the heart indices (gamma-glutamyl transferase, creatine phosphokinase, CK, lactate dehydrogenase) and lipid dysfunction caused by ARS exposure (p < 0.05). In ARS-exposed rats, there was a significant reduction in antioxidant enzymes and immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM), as well as significantly increased oxidative stress (p < 0.05). The MRC treatment effectively restored the redox status and immune variables that were disrupted by ARS exposure. Serum levels of nitric acid and lysosome were significantly lower, while levels of IL-4, TNF-α, and IFN-γ were higher in the ARS group compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). Immunohistopathology revealed that the expression of Cox2 in kidney and liver tissues varied from mild to moderate in the ARS+MRC group. Furthermore, the ARS-induced upregulation of mRNA levels of inflammatory genes such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-10, and IL-6 in hepatic tissues and MRC significantly attenuated this elevation. These findings suggest that ARS has detrimental effects on blood hematology and health, triggering specific inflammatory genes and indicating the genotoxicity of ARS. However, co-treatment with MYC can mitigate these negative effects. CONCLUSION: MRC exhibits a significant protective effect against ARS due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.",

      "abstract": "Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent cell death form characterized by reactive oxygen species (ROS) overgeneration and lipid peroxidation. Myricetin, a flavonoid that exists in numerous plants, exhibits potent antioxidant capacity. Given that iron accumulation and ROS-provoked dopaminergic neuron death are the two main pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD), we aimed to investigate whether myricetin decreases neuronal death through suppressing ferroptosis. The PD models were established by intraperitoneally injecting 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) into rats and by treating SH-SY5Y cells with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), respectively. Ferroptosis was identified by assessing the levels of Fe2+, ROS, malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione (GSH). The results demonstrated that myricetin treatment effectively mitigated MPTP-triggered motor impairment, dopamine neuronal death, and α-synuclein (α-Syn) accumulation in PD models. Myricetin also alleviated MPTP-induced ferroptosis, as evidenced by decreased levels of Fe2+, ROS, and MDA and increased levels of GSH in the substantia nigra (SN) and serum in PD models. All these changes were reversed by erastin, a ferroptosis activator. In vitro, myricetin treatment restored SH-SY5Y cell viability and alleviated MPP+-induced SH-SY5Y cell ferroptosis. Mechanistically, myricetin accelerated nuclear translocation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and subsequent glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) expression in MPP+-treated SH-SY5Y cells, two critical inhibitors of ferroptosis. Collectively, these data demonstrate that myricetin may be a potential agent for decreasing dopaminergic neuron death by inhibiting ferroptosis in PD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is characterized by abnormal β-amyloid (Aβ) plaque accumulation, tau hyperphosphorylation, reactive oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic loss. Myricetin, a dietary flavonoid, has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo. Here, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism and pathways involved in the protective effect of myricetin. METHODS: The effect of myricetin was assessed on Aβ42 oligomer-treated neuronal SH-SY5Y cells and in 3×Tg mice. Behavioral tests were performed to assess the cognitive effects of myricetin (14 days, ip) in 3×Tg mice. The levels of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), synaptic and mitochondrial proteins, glycogen synthase kinase3β (GSK3β) and extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) 2 were assessed via Western blotting. Flow cytometry assays, immunofluorescence staining, and transmission electron microscopy were used to assess mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxidative stress. RESULTS: We found that, compared with control treatment, myricetin treatment improved spatial cognition and learning and memory in 3×Tg mice. Myricetin ameliorated tau phosphorylation and the reduction in pre- and postsynaptic proteins in Aβ42 oligomer-treated neuronal SH-SY5Y cells and in 3×Tg mice. In addition, myricetin reduced reactive oxygen species generation, lipid peroxidation, and DNA oxidation, and rescued mitochondrial dysfunction via the associated GSK3β and ERK 2 signalling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new insight into the neuroprotective mechanism of myricetin in vitro in cell culture and in vivo in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.",

Myricetin has anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant potentials and can activate autophagy. Thus, this study focused on the roles and mechanisms of myricetin in IDD. A puncture-induced rat IDD model was established and intraperitoneally injected with 20-mg/kg/day myricetin. Histopathological changes of intervertebral disks (IVDs) were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining and Safranin O/Fast Green staining. The isolated NPCs from IVDs of healthy rats were stimulated with IL-1β to mimic IDD-like conditions. The roles of myricetin in cell apoptosis, extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, autophagy repression, and the JAK2/STAT3 pathway activation were examined by cell counting kit-8, flow cytometry, western blotting, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and immunofluorescence staining. Myricetin treatment attenuated the apoptosis and ECM degradation, and enhanced autophagy in the IL-1β-treated NPCs, whereas the myricetin-mediated protection was limited by autophagy inhibition. Mechanistically, myricetin activated autophagy through blocking the JAK2/STAT3 signaling. In vivo experiments revealed that intraperitoneal injection of myricetin activated NPC autophagy to relieve puncture injury in rats. Myricetin prevents IDD by attenuating NPC apoptosis and ECM degradation through blocking the JAK2/STAT3 pathway to enhance autophagy."

Past studies have identified myricetin as being able to inhibit breast cancer growth through its targeting of apoptotic mechanisms, but the precise mechanisms whereby it exerts its antitumoral effects in breast cancer remain to be characterized in detail. Here, the effects of myricetin on the induction of ferroptosis in breast cancer cells were investigated. It was found that myricetin was able to significantly inhibit 4 T1 tumor cell viability and colony forming activity, increasing the level of MDA, Fe2+, and ROS within these cells. From a mechanistic perspective, myricetin was found to induce ferroptotic 4 T1 cell death via downregulating Nrf-2 and GPX4. In vivo experimentation demonstrated that myricetin treatment was sufficient to reduce the growth of subcutaneous breast tumors in female mice as evidenced by decreases in tumor weight and volume, while significantly inhibiting Nrf-2 and GPX4 expression within the tumors of treated mice. Myricetin is capable of readily suppressing breast tumor growth in mice via the induction of ferroptotic activity through the Nrf-2/GPX4 pathway. Myricetin may thus offer utility as a therapeutic agent for the management of breast cancer in clinical settings.",

      "abstract": "Cathepsin B (CTSB) and inflammatory cytokines are critical in initiating and developing pancreatitis. Calcineurin, a central calcium (Ca2+)-responsive signaling molecule, mediates acinar cell death and inflammatory responses leading to pancreatitis. However, the detailed mechanisms for regulating CTSB activity and inflammatory cytokine production are unknown. Myricetin (MC) exhibits various biological activities, including anti-inflammatory effects. Here, we aimed to investigate MC effects on pancreatitis and the underlying mechanisms. Prophylactic and therapeutic MC treatment ameliorated the severity of cerulein-, L-arginine-, and PDL-induced acute pancreatitis (AP). The inhibition of CTSB activity by MC was mediated via decreased calcineurin activity and macrophage infiltration, not neutrophils infiltration, into the pancreas. Additionally, calcineurin activity inhibition by MC prevented the phosphorylation of Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2) during AP, resulting in the inhibition of CaMKIV phosphorylation and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) dephosphorylation. Furthermore, MC reduced nuclear factor-κB activation by modulating the calcineurin-CaMKIV-IKKα/β-Iκ-Bα and calcineurin-AMPK-sirtuin1 axes, resulting in reduced production of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6. Our results showed that MC alleviated AP severity by inhibiting acinar cell death and inflammatory responses, suggesting that MC as a calcineurin and CaMKK2 signaling modulator may be a potential treatment for AP.",

Myricetin (MYR) is a natural flavonoid widely present in many plants with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, MYR's beneficial effects and mechanisms in alleviating DOX-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) remain unknown. C57BL/6 mice were injected with 15 mg/kg of DOX to establish the DIC, and MYR solutions were administrated by gavage to investigate its cardioprotective potentials. Histopathological analysis, physiological indicators assessment, transcriptomics analysis, and RT-qPCR were used to elucidate the potential mechanism of MYR in DIC treatment. MYR reduced cardiac injury produced by DOX, decreased levels of cTnI, AST, LDH, and BNP, and improved myocardial injury and fibrosis. MYR effectively prevented DOX-induced oxidative stress, such as lowered MDA levels and elevated SOD, CAT, and GSH activities. MYR effectively suppressed NLRP3 and ASC gene expression levels to inhibit pyroptosis while regulating Caspase1 and Bax levels to reduce cardiac cell apoptosis. According to the transcriptomic analysis, glucose and fatty acid metabolism were associated with differential gene expression. KEGG pathway analysis revealed differential gene enrichment in PPAR and AMPK pathways, among others. Following validation, MYR was found to alleviate DIC by regulating glycolipid metabolism and AMPK pathway-related genes. Our findings demonstrated that MYR could mitigate DIC by regulating the processes of oxidative stress, apoptosis, and pyroptosis. MYR is critical in improving DOX-induced myocardial energy metabolism abnormalities mediated by the AMPK signaling pathway. In conclusion, MYR holds promise as a therapeutic strategy for DIC.",

      "abstract": "Restoration of blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, which drives worse outcomes of ischemic stroke, is a potential target for therapeutic opportunities, whereas a sealed BBB blocks the therapeutics entrance into the brain, making the BBB protection strategy paradoxical. Post ischemic stroke, hypoxia/hypoglycemia provokes the up-regulation of transmembrane glucose transporters and iron transporters due to multiple metabolic disorders, especially in brain endothelial cells. Herein, we develop a myricetin oligomer-derived nanostructure doped with Ce to bypass the BBB which is cointermediated by glucose transporters and iron transporters such as glucose transporters 1 (GLUT1), sodium/glucose cotransporters 1 (SGLT1), and transferrin(Tf) reporter (TfR). Moreover, it exhibits BBB restoration capacity by regulating the expression of tight junctions (TJs) through the activation of protective autophagy. The myricetin oligomers scaffold not only acts as targeting moiety but is the prominent active entity that inherits all diverse pharmacological activities of myricetin. The suppression of oxidative damage, M1 microglia activation, and inflammatory factors makes it a multitasking nanoagent with a single component as the scaffold, targeting domain and curative components.",

This study shows that myricetin potently improves PCOS by activating brown adipose tissue (BAT). ABSTRACT: PCOS is a complex endocrine disease characterized by hyperandrogenism, anovulation and polycystic ovary, and is often accompanied by metabolic disorder such as insulin resistance. BAT has been considered as a promising target for the treatment of obesity and other metabolic disease. In this study, we showed that 3 weeks of myricetin (a compound from natural product) treatment improved metabolic capacity and insulin sensitivity by activating BAT in dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-induced PCOS mice. Furthermore, increased number of corpus luteum and decreased cystic formation were observed in PCOS mice. With the hormone levels such as luteinizing hormone (LH) were reversed, estrous cycle was also normalized after myricetin treatment. Eventually, myricetin markedly improved reproductive defects in PCOS mice. In short, our results suggest that myricetin treatment dramatically ameliorates ovarian dysfunction and metabolic disturbances in PCOS and provides a novel perspective for the treatment of PCOS.",

      "abstract": "Ferroptosis holds great potential as a therapeutic approach for gastric cancer (GC), a prevalent and deadly malignant tumor associated with high rates of incidence and mortality. Myricetin, well-known for its multifaceted biomedical attributes, particularly its anticancer properties, has yet to be thoroughly investigated regarding its involvement in ferroptosis. The aim of this research was to elucidate the impact of myricetin on ferroptosis in GC progression. The present study observed that myricetin could trigger ferroptosis in GC cells by enhancing malondialdehyde production and Fe2+ accumulation while suppressing glutathione levels. Mechanistically, myricetin directly interacted with NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), influencing its stability by inhibiting its ubiquitin degradation. Moreover, myricetin regulated the inhibition of ferroptosis induced by Helicobacter pylori cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) through the NOX4/NRF2/GPX4 pathway. In vivo experiments demonstrated that myricetin treatment significantly inhibited the growth of subcutaneous tumors in BALB/c nude mice. It was accompanied by increased NOX4 expression in tumor tissue and suppression of the NRF2/GPX4 antioxidant pathway. Therefore, this research underscores myricetin as a novel inducer of ferroptosis in GC cells through its interaction with NOX4. It is a promising candidate for GC treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). Myricetin protects cardiac function in DCM. However, the low bioavailability of myricetin fails to explain its pharmacological mechanisms thoroughly. Research has shown that myricetin has a positive effect on the gut microbiota. We hypothesize that myricetin improves the development of DCM via regulating gut microbiota. METHODS: DCM mice were induced with streptozotocin and fed a high-fat diet, and then treated with myricetin by gavage and high-fat diet for 16 weeks. Indexes related to gut microbiota composition, cardiac structure, cardiac function, intestinal barrier function, and inflammation were detected. Moreover, the gut contents were transplanted to DCM mice, and the effect of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on DCM mice was assessed. RESULTS: Myricetin could improve cardiac function in DCM mice by decreasing cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis. The composition of gut microbiota, especially for short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria involving Roseburia, Faecalibaculum, and Bifidobacterium, was more abundant by myricetin treatment in DCM mice. Myricetin increased occludin expression and the number of goblet cells in DCM mice. Compared with DCM mice unfed with gut content, the cardiac function, number of goblet cells, and expression of occludin in DCM mice fed by gut contents were elevated, while cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and TLR4/MyD88 pathway-related proteins were decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Myricetin can prevent DCM development by increasing the abundance of beneficial gut microbiota and restoring the gut barrier function.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Development of end-stage renal disease is predominantly attributed to diabetic nephropathy (DN). Previous studies have indicated that myricetin possesses the potential to mitigate the pathological alterations observed in renal tissue. Nevertheless, the precise molecular mechanism through which myricetin influences the progression of DN remains uncertain. AIM: To investigate the effects of myricetin on DN and explore its potential therapeutic mechanism. METHODS: Db/db mice were administered myricetin intragastrically on a daily basis at doses of 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg for a duration of 12 wk. Subsequently, blood and urine indexes were assessed, along with examination of renal tissue pathology. Kidney morphology and fibrosis were evaluated using various staining techniques including hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, Masson's trichrome, and Sirius-red. Additionally, high-glucose culturing was conducted on the RAW 264.7 cell line, treated with 25 mM myricetin or co-administered with the PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002 for a period of 24 h. In both in vivo and in vitro settings, quantification of inflammation factor levels was conducted using western blotting, real-time qPCR and ELISA. RESULTS: In db/db mice, administration of myricetin led to a mitigating effect on DN-induced renal dysfunction and fibrosis. Notably, we observed a significant reduction in expressions of the kidney injury markers kidney injury molecule-1 and neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin, along with a decrease in expressions of inflammatory cytokine-related factors. Furthermore, myricetin treatment effectively inhibited the up-regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and interluekin-1β induced by high glucose in RAW 264.7 cells. Additionally, myricetin modulated the M1-type polarization of the RAW 264.7 cells. Molecular docking and bioinformatic analyses revealed Akt as the target of myricetin. The protective effect of myricetin was nullified upon blocking the polarization of RAW 264.7 via inhibition of PI3K/Akt activation using LY294002. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that myricetin effectively mitigates kidney injury in DN mice through the regulation of macrophage polarization via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway."

      "abstract": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) stands as a pressing health challenge, with mesangial cell fibrosis identified as a pivotal hallmark leading to glomerular sclerosis. Gaining a deeper grasp on the molecular dynamics behind this can potentially introduce groundbreaking therapeutic avenues. Recent revelations from studies on ROCK1-deficient mice, which displayed resilience against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced glomerulosclerosis and mitochondrial fragmentation, spurred our hypothesis regarding ROCK1's potential role in mesangial cell fibrosis. Subsequent rigorous experiments corroborated our theory, highlighting the critical role of ROCK1 in orchestrating mesangial cell proliferation and fibrosis, especially in high-glucose settings. Mechanistically, ROCK1 inhibition led to a notable hindrance in the high-glucose-triggered MAPK signaling pathway, particularly emphasizing the ROCK1/ERK/P38 axis. To translate this understanding into potential therapeutic interventions, we embarked on a comprehensive drug screening journey. Leveraging molecular modeling techniques, Myricetin surfaced as an efficacious inhibitor of ROCK1. Dose-dependent in vitro assays substantiated Myricetin's prowess in curtailing mesangial cell proliferation and fibrosis via ROCK1/ERK/P38 pathway. In vivo verifications paralleled these findings, with Myricetin treatment resulting in significant renal function enhancements and diminished DKD pathological markers, all pivoted around the ROCK1/ERK/P38 nexus. These findings not only deepen our comprehension of DKD molecular underpinnings but also elevate ROCK1 to the pedestal of a promising therapeutic beacon. Concurrently, Myricetin is spotlighted as a potent natural contender, heralding a new era in DKD therapeutic design.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer (OC) is the most lethal gynecological tumor, but it currently lacks effective therapeutic targets. CD147, which is overexpressed in OC, plays a crucial role in promoting malignant progression and is associated with poor prognosis in patients. Therefore, CD147 has been identified as a potential therapeutic target. However, there is a limited amount of research on the development of CD147 inhibitors. METHODS: Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay and virtual molecular docking analysis were performed to identify potential natural compounds targeting CD147. The anti‑tumor effects of myricetin were evaluated using various assays, including CCK8, Alkaline comet, immunofluorescence and xenograft mouse models. The underlying mechanism was investigated through western blot analysis and lentivirus short hairpin RNA (LV-shRNA) transfection. RESULTS: Myricetin, a flavonoid commonly found in plants, was discovered to be a potent inhibitor of CD147. Our findings demonstrated that myricetin exhibited a strong affinity for CD147 and down-regulated the protein level of CD147 by facilitating its proteasome-dependent degradation. Additionally, we observed synergistic antitumor effects of myricetin and cisplatin both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, myricetin suppressed the expression of FOXM1 and its downstream DNA damage response (DDR) genes E×O1and BRIP1, thereby enhancing the DDR induced by cisplatin. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that myricetin, a natural inhibitor of CD147, may have clinical utility in the treatment of OC due to its ability to increase genomic toxicity when combined with cisplatin.",

      "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous tumor with a poor prognosis and high metastatic potential, resulting in poor clinical outcomes, necessitating investigation to devise effective therapeutic strategies. Multiple studies have substantiated the anti-cancer properties of the naturally occurring flavonoid \"Myricetin\" in various malignancies. However, the therapeutic application of Myricetin is impeded by its poor water solubility and low oral bioavailability. To overcome this limitation, we aimed to develop nanoemulsion of Myricetin (Myr-NE) and evaluate its advantage over Myricetin alone in TNBC cells. The nanoemulsion was formulated using Capryol 90 (oil), Tween 20 (surfactant), and Transcutol HP (co-surfactant). The optimized nano-formulation underwent an evaluation to determine its size, zeta potential, morphology, stability, drug encapsulation efficiency, and in vitro release properties. The anti-cancer activity of Myr-NE was further studied to examine its distinct impact on intracellular drug uptake, cell-viability, anti-tumor signaling, oxidative stress, clonogenicity, and cell death, compared with Myricetin alone in MDA-MB-231 (TNBC) cells. The in vitro drug release and intracellular drug uptake of Myricetin was significantly increased in Myr-NE formulation as compared to Myricetin alone. Moreover, Myr-NE exhibited significant inhibition of cell proliferation, clonogenicity, and increased apoptosis with ~ 2.5-fold lower IC50 as compared to Myricetin. Mechanistic investigation revealed that nanoemulsion augmented the anti-cancer efficacy of Myricetin, most likely by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, eventually leading to enhanced cell death in TNBC cells. The study provides substantial experimental evidence to support the notion that the Myr-NE formulation has the potential to be an effective therapeutic drug for TNBC treatment.",

METHODS: Fructose was given to the rats as a 20% solution in drinking water for 15 weeks. Myricetin was administered by oral gavage for the last 6 weeks. Systolic blood pressure was measured by tail-cuff method. The effects of isoprenaline, phenylephrine, and acetylcholine on cardiac contractility and rhythmicity were recorded in the isolated right atrium and left ventricular papillary muscles. In addition to biochemical measurements, the cardiac expressions of cellular stress-related proteins were determined by western blotting. RESULTS: Myricetin improved systolic blood pressure but did not affect body weight, plasma glucose, and triglyceride levels in fructose-fed rats. The impairment of isoprenaline- and phenylephrine-mediated increases in atrial contraction and sinus rate in fructose-fed rats was restored by myricetin treatment. Isoprenaline, phenylephrine, and acetylcholine-mediated papillary muscle contractions were not changed by fructose or myricetin administration. The expression of the mitochondrial fission marker dynamin-related protein 1 and the mitophagic marker PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) was enhanced in the fructose-fed rat, and myricetin treatment markedly attenuated PINK1 expression. High-fructose intake augmented phosphorylation of the proinflammatory molecule Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and the stress-regulated kinase JNK1, but myricetin only reduced NF-κB expression. Moreover, myricetin diminished the elevation in the expression of the pro-apoptotic Bax. CONCLUSION: Our results imply that myricetin has a protective role in cardiac irregularities induced by a high-fructose diet through reducing systolic blood pressure, improving cardiac adrenergic responses, suppressing PINK1, NF-κB, and Bax expression, and thus reflecting a potential therapeutic value.",

The current study investigated the molecular basis of myricetin, a flavonoid that impedes IL-21-mediated differentiation of Tfh cells in RA. Through high-throughput virtual screening of natural compounds that inhibit IL-21, we found that myricetin binds to IL-21 and hampers its interaction with IL-21 receptor (IL-21R). Our in vivo studies demonstrated that myricetin treatment ameliorated the clinical manifestations in adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) mice by reducing paw thickness and cellular infiltration. In addition, myricetin inhibited splenic Tfh cell differentiation and IL-21 production in AIA mice. Myricetin negatively regulates JAK/STAT signaling and the downstream Bcl-6 transcription factor at the molecular level, which arrests Tfh cell differentiation. Our current research proposal to target IL-21 with myricetin inevitably represents a new molecular approach that expedites new alternative drugs for rheumatoid arthritis therapy.

In this work, we planned to discover the therapeutic roles of myricetin on the ethylene glycol (EG)-induced nephrolithiasis in rats. The experimental rats were treated with 0.75% of EG through drinking water for 4 weeks to initiate the nephrolithiasis and subsequently treated with 25 and 50 mg/kg of myricetin. The body weight and urine volume were measured regularly. After the sacrification of rats, the samples were collected, and serum and urinary biomarkers such as creatinine, urea, Ca2 + ion, and BUN, OPN, oxalate, and citrate levels were determined using assay kits. These biomarkers, the MDA level and CAT, SOD, and GPx activities, were assessed in the kidney tissue homogenates. The IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α levels were also quantified using respective kits. The histopathological analysis was done on the kidney tissues. Myricetin treatment did not show major changes in the body weight and kidney weight in the EG-induced rats. The treatment with 25 and 50 mg/kg of myricetin considerably reduced the urea, creatinine, BUN, Ca2 + ion, and oxalate and increased the citrate content in serum and urine samples of EG-induced rats. Further, myricetin depleted the inflammatory cytokines and MDA levels and elevated the CAT, SOD, and GPx activities in the renal tissues. The activities of ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, and LDH were also reduced by the myricetin. Furthermore, the myricetin upheld the histoarchitecture of the kidneys. The outcomes of this investigation propose that myricetin is effective in EG-induced urolithiasis probably because of its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and renoprotective activities. In addition, further studies are still required to verify the precise therapeutic mechanism of myricetin.",

Inhibition of neuroinflammation caused by microglia activation is a reasonable strategy to promote neurological recovery after TBI. Myricetin is a natural flavonoid that has shown good therapeutic effects in a variety of neurological disease models, but its therapeutic effect on TBI is not clear. We demonstrated that intraperitoneal injection of appropriate doses of myricetin significantly improved recovery of neurological function after TBI in Sprague Dawley rats and inhibited excessive inflammatory responses around the lesion site. Myricetin dramatically reduced the expression of toxic microglia markers generated by TBI and LPS, according to the outcomes of in vivo and in vitro tests. In particular, the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase 2, and some pro-inflammatory cytokines was reduced, which protected learning and memory functions in TBI rats. Through network pharmacological analysis, we found that myricetin may inhibit microglia hyperactivation through the EGFR-AKT/STAT pathway. These findings imply that myricetin is a promising treatment option for the management of neuroinflammation following TBI.",

However, the protective effects of myricetin (MYC) and fisetin (FST), which are known to have potent antioxidant properties, against nephrotoxicity caused by exposure to lead acetate (LA), the water-soluble form of lead, have not been investigated. Our study investigated the protective role of these flavonoids against LA intoxication-induced nephrotoxicity. In our study, 42 male rats were used. The rats were randomly selected and divided into 6 groups. These groups were: control, LA (100 g/kg), LA + MYC (100 mg/kg), LA + MYC (200 mg/kg), LA + FST (100 mg/kg) and LA + FST (200 mg/kg). All chemicals were administered daily by gavage for 28 days. According to the experimental protocol, the animals were sacrificed and their kidney tissues were isolated. Serum biochemical parameters, histological examinations, levels of several trace elements, oxidative stress and inflammatory parameters at both biochemical and molecular levels in kidney tissues were examined. After LA administration, tissue lead levels increased and zinc levels decreased. This situation was reversed by MYC and FST treatment. Oxidative stress and inflammatory response were increased in the kidney tissue of LA-treated rats and renal function was impaired. It was observed that both doses of MYC and high dose of FST could prevent nephrotoxicity. Oral administration of both doses of MYC and high dose FST ameliorated the changes in biochemical, oxidative and inflammatory parameters. Restoration of normal renal tissue architecture was also demonstrated by histological studies. MYC and FST were found to have promising biological activity against LA-induced nephrotoxicity, acting by attenuating inflammation and oxidative stress and improving antioxidant status.",

Among the diverse cytokines that engender FLS, interleukin-21 (IL-21) was reported to stimulate hyperproliferation and perpetuate inflammation. Recently, choline kinase (ChoKα) has been reported to be an essential enzyme aiding RA-FLS hyperproliferation by altering phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. The current study aimed to elucidate the therapeutic efficacy of myricetin, a flavonoid, in abating the IL-21-induced tumor-like phenotype of adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA)-FLS via the ChoKα signaling cascade. Our results showed that myricetin suppressed IL-21 receptor expression and activation of the ChoKα signaling cascade (N-Ras, Ral-GDS, and PI3K) in IL-21-induced AIA-FLS. Consequently, myricetin treatment decreased ChoKα and PLD2 enzymatic activity and inhibited the proliferative, migratory, and invasive properties of AIA-FLSs. Our results demonstrated that myricetin could be a promising anti-arthritic compound by abating IL-21-induced hyperproliferation, migration, and invasive behavior of AIA-FLS by downregulating the ChoKα signaling cascade.",

Nevertheless, the search for small molecules with ability to inhibit and suppress fibril formation is an active and promising area of the research. Herein, the binding interactions and inhibitory effects of myricetin and morin hydrate on the in vitro fibrillation of bovine α-lactalbumin (BLA) have been investigated. The intrinsic fluorescence of BLA was quenched by myricetin and morin hydrate through combination of the static and dynamic quenching along with non-radiative Förster energy transfer mechanisms. The binding of these two flavonoids to BLA were not accompanied by major alteration in the conformation of BLA as evidenced by CD studies. The results of the fluorescence quenching analyses indicated almost the same binding affinities of myricetin and morin hydrate toward BLA (Kb ~ 106 M-1). However, the results of thioflavin T (ThT) assays showed that myricetin is a stronger inhibitor against BLA fibrillation compared to morin hydrate.",

As the majority of chemotherapeutic medications are associated with recurrence, drug resistance, and side effects, scientists are shifting to beneficial agents for prevention and treatment, such as natural molecules. Myricetin 3-rhamnoside, a natural flavonol glycoside is known for diverse pharmacological activities but fewer reports describe the antiproliferative ability. The study aims to investigate the antiproliferative efficacy and target [hyaluronidase (HYAL) and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), two poor breast cancer prognostic markers] modulatory potential of myricetin 3-rhamnoside on breast cancer cell lines using cytotoxicity assays and in silico docking, molecular dynamics analysis, cell-free and cell-based test methods. Myricetin 3-rhamnoside significantly retard the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells in SRB (IC50 88.64 ± 7.14 µM) and MTT (56.26 ± 8.50 µM) assay. It suppressed the transition of cells to the S-phase by inducing arrest in the G0/G1 phase with a fold change of 1.10. It shows robust binding interaction with ODC (-7.90 kcal/mol) and HYAL (-9.46 kcal/mol) and inhibits ODC (15.22 ± 2.61 µM) and HYAL (11.92 ± 2.89 µM) activity, but in a cell-based assay, the prominent response was observed against HYAL (21.46 ± 4.03 µM). Besides, it shows a 1.38 fold-down regulation of HYAL and forms a stable complex with HYAL. The binding pocket for myricetin 3-rhamnoside and the simulation pocket during the simulation are identical, indicating that myricetin 3-rhamnoside is actively blocking hyaluronidase. The computational prediction suggests it is a safe molecule. These observations imply that myricetin 3-rhamnoside could be used as a pharmacophore to design and synthesize a novel and safe agent for managing hormone-independent breast cancer.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The ternary complexes were prepared by covalent or non-covalent binding of soy protein isolate (SPI), β-glucan (DG) and myricetin (MC), which were evidenced to be stable. It was indicated that the emulsion stabilized by covalent complex of SPI, DG and MC, exhibited higher zeta-potential and smaller particle size than those stabilized by non-covalent complex. Furthermore, the covalent complexes prepared from different addition sequences showed different efficiencies in stabilizing the emulsion, in which SPI-DG-MC and SPI-MC-DG-stabilized emulsions possess better stability, emulsifying activity and storage resistance under adverse environmental treatment, with CI values of 62.7% and 64.3% after 25 days, respectively. According to oxidative stability and rheology analysis of the emulsions, it was found that the SPI-MC-DG complex prepared at the ratio of 4:2:1 was more stable with relatively less lipid oxidation products and a tighter stacking structure, and the final LH value was 39.98 mmol/L and the MDA value was 6.34 mmol/L. These findings implied that the ternary complex has the potential to deliver fat-soluble active ingredient by means of emulsion, but which depends on the mode and sequence of the molecular interactions.",

The clinical symptoms of this disease are fever, polyarthralgia, and skin rash, generally self-limiting, although patients may develop a chronic disabling condition or suffer lethal complications. Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment or vaccine available. Thus, the search for effective therapies to control CHIKV infection is an urgent need. This study evaluated the antiviral activity of flavonoids isolated from Marcetia taxifolia by in vitro and in silico analysis. Cytotoxicity of compounds was determined by MTT assay and viral load was assessed in cell substrates supernatants by plaque-forming and RT-qPCR assays. Selected molecules were analyzed by molecular docking assays. Myricetin 3-rhamnoside (MR) and myricetin 3-(6-rhamnosylgalactoside) (MRG) were tested for antiviral assays and analyzed by the TCID50 method and RT-qPCR. MR exhibited dose-dependent antiviral activity, reducing viral titer at concentrations of 150-18.8 μg/mL by at least 1-log. Similarly, MRG showed a significant decrease in viral titer at concentrations of 37.5, 9.4, and 2.3 μg/mL. RT-qPCR analysis also displayed a substantial reduction of CHIKV RNA for both flavonoids. Furthermore, molecular docking of the selected flavonoids proposed the nsP3 macrodomain as a possible target of action. Our study reveals that MR and MRG could be considered promising anti-CHIKV therapeutic agents. Molecular modeling studies showed MR and MRG ligands with a high affinity for the N-terminal region of the nsP3 macrodomain, postulating them as a potential target of action for the CHIKV control."

      "abstract": "Ubiquitination is a crucial type of protein modification which helps to control substrate degradation and maintain cell homeostasis. Recent studies suggest that ubiquitination and deubiquitination are involved in regulating metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells and maintaining cancer stem cells. Uba1, a crucial protein in the ubiquitination cascade, can be targeted to develop effective inhibitors for cancer treatment. In previous work, we showed that myricetin (Myr) acts as a potential human Uba1 (hUba1) inhibitor. In this study, we have utilized computational modeling techniques to attempt to illustrate the mechanism of action of Myr. Through extra-precision docking, we confirmed that Myr binds to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding site of hUba1 (referred to as hotspot 1) with the highest binding affinity. The dynamics of this interaction revealed that hUba1 undergoes a conformational shift from open to closed upon binding of Myr. Myr also migrates outward to interact with the crossover loop simultaneously as the rotational shift of the ubiquitin fold domain (UFD) takes place, thereby blocking access to the ubiquitin binding interface of hUba1 and the crossover loop. The outward migration also explains the reversible nature of Myr binding to hUba1 in previous experiments. We hypothesize that Myr acts as an inhibitor of Uba1∼Ub thioester bond formation by causing a large domain shift toward a closed conformation. Few other analogues of Myr containing the same flavone skeleton showed promising docking scores against hUba1 and could be considered for further validation. We propose that Myr and some of its analogues reported in this study may be promising candidates for developing effective Uba1 inhibitors for cancer treatment."

Myricetin is an agent that exerts anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in various pathological conditions. Here, we investigated the ameliorative effects of myricetin on the IVD degeneration. NPCs were obtained from the IVD of rats, and were treated with myricetin (0, 5, 10, 15, 20 μM) for 24 h before 20 ng/mL IL-1β stimulation. RT-qPCR, western blotting, and ELISA were applied to evaluate the levels of inflammatory factors (iNOS, COX-2, TNF-α, IL-6, PGE2, and Nitrite) and extracellular matrix (ECM)-associated components (MMP13, ADAMTS-5, aggrecan, and collagen II) in NPCs. Activation status of related signaling pathways (NF-κB and Nrf2) was determined using western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. Experimental rat models of IDD were established using a needle puncture method. Myricetin (20 mg/kg) was administrated intraperitoneally, and the degeneration was evaluated using histopathological analysis. Myricetin treatment attenuated the IL-1β-induced production of inflammatory factors in NPCs. Downregulation of aggrecan and collagen II as well as upregulation of MMP-13 and ADAMTS-5 in NPCs caused by IL-1β was reversed by myricetin treatment. Mechanistically, myricetin blocked NF-κB signaling by activation of Nrf2 in IL-1β-stimulated NPCs. Moreover, inhibition of Nrf2 reversed the protective effects of myricetin in NPCs. The in vivo experiments showed that myricetin ameliorated the IDD progression in rats. The present work suggests that Nrf2 is involved in the pathogenesis of IDD and shows the protective effects as well as the underlying mechanism of myricetin on Nrf2 activation in NPCs.",

In this study, a hybrid compound consisting of myricetin and nobiletin was synthesized and its biological activity was evaluated. We named the hybrid compound MNH, and its structure was confirmed by spectroscopy. This study used serum metabolomics profiling with LC/MS and 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis to explore the anti-HUA efficacy of MNH on a yeast paste-induced mouse model. The results showed that serum uric acid (UA), creatinine (CRE) and urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were significantly decreased after the intervention of MNH. The efficacy of MNH in lowering UA was somewhat greater than that of myricetin and nobiletin. In addition, MNH could repair the renal histopathological damage. Moreover, serum metabolomics demonstrated that MNH regulated the metabolic pathways involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism and alanine etc. Furthermore, MNH supplementation restored the composition of gut microbiota with remarkable reductions in Lactobacillus and Limosilactobacillus and significant elevations in norank_f_Muribaculaceae and Bacteroides at the genus level. Taken together, these results indicated that MNH might represent a protective effect against HUA via modulating gut microbiota and metabolomics."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been reported to be a novel promising target for the regeneration of degenerated intervertebral discs (IVDs). However, the culture and survival limitations of MSCs remain challenging for MSC-based biological therapy. Myricetin, a common natural flavonoid, has been suggested to possess antiaging and antioxidant abilities. Therefore, we investigated the biological function of myricetin, and its related mechanisms involving cell senescence in intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The nucleus pulposus-derived mesenchymal stem cells (NPMSCs) were isolated from 4-month-old Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and identified by examining surface markers and multipotent differentiation. Rat NPMSCs were cultured in an MSC culture medium or culture medium with different concentrations of H2O2. Myricetin or the combination of myricetin and EX527 were added to the culture medium to investigate the effects of myricetin. Cell viability was evaluated by cell counting kit-8 assays (CCK-8). The apoptosis rate was determined using Annexin V/PI dual staining. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was analyzed by a fluorescence microscope after JC-1 staining. The cell senescence was determined by SA-β-Gal staining. MitoSOX green was used to selectively estimate mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) Apoptosis-associated proteins (Bax, Bcl2, and cleaved caspase-3), senescence markers (p16, p21, and p53), and SIRT1/PGC-1α signaling pathway-related proteins (SIRT1 and PGC-1α) were evaluated by western blotting. RESULTS: The cells isolated from nucleus pulposus (NP) tissues met the criteria for MSCs. Myricetin showed no cytotoxicity up to a concentration of 100 μM in rat NPMSCs cultured for 24 h. Myricetin pretreatment exhibited protective effects against H₂O₂-induced apoptosis. Myricetin could also alleviate H₂O₂-induced mitochondrial dysfunctions of increased mitochondrial ROS production and reduced MMP. Moreover, myricetin pretreatment delayed rat NPMSC senescence, as evidenced by decreased exppression of senescence indicators. Pretreatment of NPMSCs with 10 μM EX527, a selective inhibitor of SIRT1, prior to exposure to 100 μM H2O2, reversed the inhibitory effects of myricetin on cell apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Myricetin could affect the SIRT1/PGC-1α pathway to protect mitochondrial functions and alleviate cell senescence in H₂O₂-treated NPMSCs.",

      "abstract": "The brain and liver are more susceptible to ischemia and reperfusion (IR) injury (IRI), which triggers the reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst and inflammatory cascade and results in severe neuronal damage or hepatic injury. Moreover, the damaged endothelial barrier contributes to proinflammatory activity and limits the delivery of therapeutic agents such as some macromolecules and nanomedicine despite the integrity being disrupted after IRI. Herein, we constructed a phenylboronic-decorated chitosan-based nanoplatform to deliver myricetin, a multifunctional polyphenol molecule for the treatment of cerebral and hepatic ischemia. The chitosan-based nanostructures are widely studied cationic carriers for endothelium penetration such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and sinusoidal endothelial barrier (SEB). The phenylboronic ester was chosen as the ROS-responsive bridging segment for conjugation and selective release of myricetin molecules, which meanwhile scavenged the overexpressed ROS in the inflammatory environment. The released myricetin molecules fulfill a variety of roles including antioxidation through multiple phenolic hydroxyl groups, inhibition of the inflammatory cascade by regulation of the macrophage polarization from M1 to M2, and endothelial injury repairment. Taken together, our present study provides valuable insight into the development of efficient antioxidant and anti-inflammatory platforms for potential application against ischemic disease.",

      "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is believed to be caused by the aggregation of misfolded or mutated superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). As there is currently no treatment, research into aggregation inhibitors continues. Based on docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and experimental observations, we propose that myricetin, a plant flavonoid, can act as a potent anti-amyloidogenic polyphenol against SOD1 aggregation. Our MD simulation results showed that myricetin stabilizes the protein interface, destabilizes the preformed fibril, and decreases the rate of fibril elongation. Myricetin inhibits the aggregation of SOD1 in a dose-dependent manner as shown by the ThT aggregation kinetics curves. Our transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and circular dichroism experiments indicate that fewer shorter fibrils have formed. Fluorescence spectroscopy results predict the involvement of a static quenching mechanism characterized by a strong binding between protein and myricetin. Importantly, size exclusion chromatography revealed the potential of myricetin for fibril destabilization and depolymerization. These experimental observations complement the MD results. Thus, myricetin is a potent SOD1 aggregation inhibitor that can reduce the fibril load. Using the structure of myricetin as a reference, it is possible to design more effective therapeutic inhibitors against ALS that prevent the disease and reverse its effects.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and insufficient insulin secretion. It is considered that chronic hyperglycemia causes serious problems due to diabetic complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. Primarily, treatment in T2DM is pharmacologically tried by using drugs that are insulin sensitizers, insulin secretagogues, α-glucosidase inhibitors, and glucose transporter inhibitors. However, long-term application of these drugs frequently induces various harmful side effects, suggesting that the importance of taking advantage of natural products like phytochemicals. Accordingly, flavonoids, a group of phytochemicals, have attracted attention as components of natural products which are effective in the treatment of several diseases containing T2DM and are strongly recommended as food supplements to ameliorate T2DM-related complications. Several well-studied flavonoids such as quercetin and catechin are known to have anti-diabetic, anti-obesity, and anti-hypertensive actions, although a huge number of flavonoids are still under investigation and their actions are not fully understood. In this situation, myricetin is being shown to be a multiple bioactive compound to prevent and/or suppress hyperglycemia through inhibiting digestion and uptake of saccharides and enhancing insulin secretion as a possible GLP-1 receptor agonist, and to ameliorate T2DM-related complications by protecting endothelial cells from oxidative stress induced by hyperglycemia. In this review, we summarize the multiple effects of myricetin on the targets of T2DM treatment, comparing with different flavonoids."

      "abstract": "Cancer is a major public health concern worldwide and main burden of the healthcare system. Regrettably, most of the currently used cancer treatment approaches such as targeted therapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery usually cause adverse complications including hair loss, bone density loss, vomiting, anemia and other complications. However, to overcome these limitations, there is an urgent need to search for the alternative anticancer drugs with better efficacy as well as less adverse complications. Based on the scientific evidences, it is proven that naturally occurring antioxidants present in medicinal plants or their bioactive compounds might constitute a good therapeutic approach in diseases management including cancer. In this regard, myricetin, a polyhydroxy flavonol found in a several types of plants and its role in diseases management as anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and hepato-protective has been documented. Moreover, its role in cancer prevention has been noticed through modulation of angiogenesis, inflammation, cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, myricetin plays a significant role in cancer prevention through the inhibition of inflammatory markers such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2). Moreover, myricetin increases the chemotherapeutic potential of other anticancer drugs through modulation of cell signaling molecules activity. This review elaborates the information of myricetin role in cancer management through modulating of various cell-signaling molecules based on in vivo and in vitro studies. In addition, synergistic effect with currently used anticancer drugs and approaches to improve bioavailability are described. The evidences collected in this review will help different researchers to comprehend the information about its safety aspects, effective dose for different cancers and implication in clinical trials. Moreover, different challenges need to be focused on engineering different nanoformulations of myricetin to overcome the poor bioavailability, loading capacity, targeted delivery and premature release of this compound. Furthermore, some more derivatives of myricetin need to be synthesized to check their anticancer potential.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: To evaluate the potential of Myricetin against S.aureus induced osteomyelitis. BACKGROUND: Osteomyelitis is infected condition of bone by micro-organisms. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), inflammatory cytokines and Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR-2) pathway are mainly involved in osteomyelitis. Myricetin is a plant-food derived flavonoid which shows anti-inflammatory activity. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we evaluated the potential of Myricetin against S.aureus induced osteomyelitis. MC3T3-E1 cells were used for in vitro studies. METHOD: Murine model of osteomyelitis was developed in BALB/c mice by injecting S.aureus in the medullary cavity of the femur. The mice were studied for bone destruction, anti-biofilm activity, osteoblast growth markers alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteopontin (OCN) and collagen type-I (COLL-1) were studied by RT-PCR, ELISA analysis for levels of proinflammatory factors CRP, IL-6 and IL-1β. Expression of proteins by Western blot analysis and anti-biofilm effect by Sytox green dye fluorescence assay. Target confirmation was done by performing in silico docking analysis. RESULTS: Myricetin reduced bone destruction in osteomyelitis induced mice. The treatment decreased bone levels of ALP, OCN, COLL-1 and TLR2. Myricetin decreased serum levels of CRP, IL-6 and IL-1β. The treatment suppressed activation of MAPK pathway and showed anti-biofilm effect. Docking studies suggested high binding affinity of Myricetin with MAPK protein in silico, by showing lower binding energies. CONCLUSION: Myricetin suppresses osteomyelitis by inhibiting ALP, OCN, COLL-1 via the TLR2 and MAPK pathway involving inhibition of biofilm formation. In silico studies suggested MAPK as potential binding protein for myricetin.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents the common neurodegenerative disease featured by the manifestations of cognitive impairment and memory loss. AD could be alleviated with medication and improving quality of life. Clinical treatment of AD is mainly aimed at improving the cognitive function of patients. Donepezil, memantine and galantamine are commonly used drug. But they could only relieve AD, not cure it. Therefore, new treatment strategies focusing on AD pathogenesis are of great significance and value. Myricetin (Myr) is a natural flavonoid extracted from Myrica rubra. And it shows different bioactivities, such as anti-inflammation, antioxidation as well as central nervous system (CNS) activities. Nonetheless, its associated mechanism in treating AD remains unknown. PURPOSE: Here we focused on investigating Myr's effect on treating AD and exploring if its protection on the nervous system activity was associated with specifically inhibiting P38 MAPK signaling pathway while regulating mitochondria-NLRP3 inflammasome-microglia. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This work utilized triple transgenic mice (3 × Tg-AD) as AD models and Aβ25-35 was used to induce BV2 cells to build an in vitro AD model. Behavioristics, pathology and related inflammatory factors were examined. Molecular mechanisms are investigated by western-blot, immunofluorescence staining, CETSA, molecular docking, network pharmacology. RESULTS: According to our findings, Myr could remarkably improve memory loss, spatial learning ability, Aβ plaque deposition, neuronal and synaptic damage in 3 × Tg-AD mice through specifically inhibiting P38 MAPK pathway activation while restraining microglial hyperactivation. Furthermore, Myr promoted the transformation of microglial phenotype, restored the mitochondrial fission-fusion balance, facilitated mitochondrial biogenesis, and restrained NLRP3 inflammasome activation and neuroinflammation. For the in-vitro experiments, P38 agonist dehydrocorydaline (DHC) was utilized to confirm the key regulatory role of P38 MAPK signaling pathway on the mitochondria-NLRP3 inflammasome-microglia channel. CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed the therapeutic efficacy of Myr in experimental AD, and implied that the associated mechanism is possibly associated with inhibiting tmitochondrial dysfunction, activating NLRP3 inflammasome, and neuroinflammation which was mediated by P38 MAPK pathway. Myr is the drug candidate in AD therapy via targeting P38 MAPK pathway.",

Chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, surgery, and radiation therapy are among cancer treatment options. Still, these treatments can induce patient side effects, including recurrence, multidrug resistance, fever, and weakness. As a result, the scientific community is always working on natural phytochemical substances. Numerous phytochemical compounds, including taxol analogues, vinca alkaloids such as vincristine and vinblastine, and podophyllotoxin analogues, are currently undergoing testing and have shown promising results against a number of the deadliest diseases, as well as considerable advantages due to their safety and low cost. According to research, secondary plant metabolites such as myricetin, a flavonoid in berries, herbs, and walnuts, have emerged as valuable bio-agents for cancer prevention. Myricetin and its derivatives have antiinflammatory, anticancer, apoptosis-inducing, and anticarcinogenic properties and can prevent cancer cell proliferation. Multiple studies have found that myricetin has anticancer characteristics in various malignancies, including colon, breast, prostate, bladder, and pancreatic cancers. Current knowledge of the anticancer effects of myricetin reveals its promise as a potentially bioactive chemical produced from plants for the prevention and treatment of cancer. This review aimed to study the numerous bioactivities, mode of action, and modification of several cellular processes that myricetin possesses to impede the spread of cancer cells.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Antimicrobial resistance, which is considered one of the most important problems of the 21 st century, brings many problems with it, such as increasing mortality rates and treatment costs. Difficulties in the treatment of infections caused by resistant microorganisms have led to the search and need for new antimicrobials or new molecules that interact synergistically with antimicrobials. The aim of this study is to investigate whether various flavonoids have synergistic effects with some antibiotics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: During this study, standard bacterial strains Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 700603, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 43300 were used. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of all antibiotics and flavonoids were found by the broth microdilution method. Interactions between antibiotics and flavonoids were then determined by using the checkerboard method. Interactions between antibiotics and flavonoids were evaluated according to the FIC index (ΣFIC) results. RESULTS: According to the results of the microdilution test, the bacterial strains used in this study (except for MRSA) were generally sensitive to antibiotics. Interaction study results showed promising results regarding the synergistic interactions of antibiotics with flavonoids. Epigallocatechin gallate and luteolin especially showed synergistic interaction with antibiotics in many microorganisms. It was found that myricetin showed synergistic interaction only with levofloxacin. Likewise, it was detected that apigenin had limited synergistic interaction with antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results highlight that flavonoids may be a useful tool in overcoming antibiotic resistance.",

The therapeutic effect and metabolic regulation mechanism of myricetin, a phytochemical with potential therapeutic effects, have rarely been studied. In this study, we established mice models of different doses of myricetin intervention with 1 week of HIE after intervention. Cardiac function tests, serology, and pathological examinations were used to evaluate the protective effect of myricetin on the myocardium. The possible therapeutic targets of myricetin were obtained using an integrated analysis of metabolomics and network pharmacology and verified using molecular docking and RT-qPCR experiments. Different concentrations of myricetin improved cardiac function, significantly reduced the levels of myocardial injury markers, alleviated myocardial ultrastructural damage, reduced the area of ischemia/hypoxia, and increased the content of CX43. We obtained the potential targets and regulated metabolic network of myricetin by combined network pharmacology and metabolomics analysis and validated them by molecular docking and RT-qPCR. In conclusion, our findings suggest that myricetin exerts anti-cardiac injury effects of HIE through the downregulation of PTGS2 and MAOB and the upregulation of MAP2K1 and EGFR while regulating the complicated myocardial metabolic network.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a crucial cause of neonatal death and neurological sequelae, but currently there is no effective therapy drug for HIE. Both oxidative stress and apoptosis play critical roles in the pathological development of HIE. Myricetin, a naturally extracted flavonol compound, exerts remarkable effects against oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation. However, the role and underlying molecular mechanism of myricetin on HIE remain unclear. Methods: In this study, we established the neonatal rats hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain damage model in vivo and CoCl2 induced PC12 cell model in vitro to explore the neuroprotective effects of myricetin on HI injury, and illuminate the potential mechanism. Results: Our results showed that myricetin intervention could significantly reduce brain infarction volume, glia activation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress marker levels through activating NRF2 (Nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2) and increase the expressions of NRF2 downstream proteins NQO-1 and HO-1. In addition, the NRF2 inhibitor ML385 could significantly reverse the effects of myricetin. Conclusion: This study found that myricetin might alleviate oxidative stress and apoptosis through NRF2 signaling pathway to exert the protective role for HI injury, which suggested that myricetin might be a promising therapeutic agent for HIE."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) is an important pathogen in livestock animals and humans causing a wide array of systemic and enteric diseases. The current study was performed to investigate the inhibitory activity of myricetin (MYR), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocomposite against growth and α-hemolysin of C. perfringens isolated from beef meat and chicken sources. RESULTS: The overall occurrence of C. perfringens was 29.8%. The prevalence of C. perfringens was higher in chicken (38.3%) than in beef meat products (10%). The antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that C. perfringens isolates exhibited high resistance levels for metronidazole (93%), bacitracin (89%), penicillin G (84%), and lincomycin (76%). Of note, 1% of C. perfringens isolates were pandrug-resistant (PDR), 4% were extensive drug-resistant (XDR), while 91% were multidrug-resistant. The results of broth microdilution technique revealed that all tested C. perfringens isolates were susceptible to MYR-loaded ZnO/PVA with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranged from 0.125 to 2 µg/mL. Moreover, the MYR either alone or combined with the nanocomposite had no cytotoxic activities on chicken red blood cells (cRBCs). Transcriptional modifications of MYR, ZnO, ZnO/PVA, and ZnO/PVA/MYR nanocomposite were determined, and the results showed significant down-regulation of α-hemolysin fold change to 0.5, 0.7, 0.6, and 0.28, respectively compared to the untreated bacteria. CONCLUSION: This is an in vitro study reporting the antimicrobial potential of MYR-coated ZnO nanocomposite as an effective therapeutic candidate against C. perfringens. An in vivo approach is the next step to provide evidence for applying these alternatives in the treatment and prevention of C. perfringens-associated diseases.",

Recent studies revealed that myricetin has various biological effects, including anti-oxidation. The aim of this study is to investigate the protective effect of myricetin against arsenic-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. Rats were randomized to one of the following groups: control, myricetin (2 mg/kg), arsenic (5 mg/kg), myricetin (1 mg/kg) + arsenic, and myricetin (2 mg/kg) + arsenic. Myricetin was given intraperitoneally 30 min before arsenic administration (5 mg/kg for 10 days). After treatments, the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB), lipid peroxidation (LPO), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and total thiol molecules (TTM) were determined in serum samples and cardiac tissues. Also, histological changes in cardiac tissue were evaluated. Myricetin pretreatment inhibited arsenic-induced increase in LDH, AST, CK-MB, and LPO levels. Pretreatment with myricetin also enhanced the decreased TAC and TTM levels. In addition, myricetin improved histopathological alterations in arsenic-treated rats. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that treatment with myricetin prevented arsenic-induced cardiac toxicity at least in part by decreasing oxidative stress and restoring the antioxidant system."

However, the anti-aging effect of MYR on nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) is still unknown. The study aimed to explore the effect of MYR on the senescence of NPCs. METHODS: Methyl-thiazolyl tetrazolium assay was used to detect NPCs viability. Senescence level was evaluated by senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) staining and the expression levels of P21, P16, IL-6 and IL-8. RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq) technology was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between hydrogen peroxide + MYR (HO + MYR) group and HO group, and Gene Ontology (GO) functional was performed to analyze DEGs. A Venn diagram was generated to screen overlapping DEGs related to aging and inflammation, and the role of the promising validated DEG was selected for further investigation by gene functional assays. RESULTS: HO inhibited NPCs viability and stimulated the senescent phenotype of NPCs, whereas MYR treatment significantly reversed SA-β-gal activity in NPCs. MYR also reduced the expression of p21 and p16 and the secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 induced by HO. RNA-seq screened 421 DEGs. The GO enrichment results showed DEGs were mainly enriched in terms such as \"sterol biosynthetic process\". We also found SERPINE1 has the highest log2FC abs. Silence of SERPINE1 inhibited HO-induced NPCs senescence, and overexpression of SERPINE1 could limit the anti-aging effect of MYR. CONCLUSIONS: MYR alleviated HO-induced senescence of NPCs by regulating SERPINE1 in vitro.",

Myricetin, a flavonoid compound found in natural plants, has multiple biological functions. In this study, we show that myricetin demonstrated potent efficacy in imatinib-resistant CML CD34 + stem/progenitor cells with less toxicity in normal bone marrow. Myricetin is also active against imatinib-resistant CML bulk cells. The in vitro observations on the therapeutic effects of myricetin were translatable to in vivo imatinib-resistant CML xenograft mouse models. Mechanism studies showed that myricetin decreased the phosphorylation of eIF4E and Ak strain transforming, and the protein level of c-Myc and Cyclin D1. Rescue studies using eIF4E (S209D) and (S209A) confirmed that eIF4E phosphorylation inhibition was the mechanism of myricetin's action in CML. Our results suggest that myricetin may be a potential lead for drug development to overcome imatinib resistance in CML.",

      "abstract": "Myocarditis is defined as an inflammatory disease of the myocardium, and the autoimmune response specific to myocardium plays an important role in chronic myocarditis. Inhibiting myocardial-specific autoimmune response and inflammation is crucial to treat myocarditis. Myricetin is a plant-derived flavonoid in nature which has potent anti-inflammatory and cardiovascular protective properties. However, the pharmacological effect of myricetin in autoimmune myocarditis is undefined. It is necessary to investigate the role and potential mechanisms of myricetin in autoimmune myocarditis. Therefore, purified cardiac myosin was subcutaneously injected to mice to establish the experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) model. Myricetin was solubilized in normal saline and administered everyday by gavage from the day of immunization. After 21 days of treatment, it was found that myricetin significantly alleviated myocardial injury in EAM mice. The serum anti-cardiac myosin antibody, immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgM levels and the proportion of T helper 17 (Th17) cells were decreased and the proportion of regulatory T (Treg) cells was increased with the treatment of myricetin in EAM mice. The myosin-specific T cell proliferation was inhibited by myricetin. Meanwhile, myricetin suppressed the expressions of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), phospho (p)-p65, p-c-Jun and Act1/TRAF6/TAK1 in H9C2 cells and myocardial tissues of EAM mice. These results revealed that myricetin inhibited the autoimmune response specific to myocardium and the expression of MCP-1 in cardiomyocytes, which suggested that myricetin ameliorated autoimmune myocarditis by modulating immune response and the expression of MCP-1. Therefore, myricetin may be a promising therapeutic strategy for autoimmune myocarditis.",

Schrad, widely distributed in Asian and African countries, is used to treat cancers in traditional Uyghur medicine. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: The combination of Cucurbitacin E (CuE) and Myricetin (Myr) of C. colocynthis could treat NSCLC by targeting autophagy. STUDY DESIGN: The potential anti-cancer components (CuE and Myr) of C. colocynthis were identified using in-silico methods and further in vitro explored the anti-NSCLC properties of the combination of CuE and Myr. METHODS: Network pharmacology and molecular docking were used to identify potential therapeutic compounds of C. colocynthis for the treatment of NSCLC. In A549 cells, the anti-cancer activities and synergy of CuE and Myr were studied using CompuSyn, their mechanism behind autophagy regulation was determined by western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: CuMy-12 (CuE: 0.5 µM, Myr: 20 µM), a combination of CuE and Myr from C. colocynthis, inhibited A549 cell proliferation and colony formation, and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, exhibiting a synergistic effect. Furthermore, CuMy-12 inhibited autophagy and activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which was characterized by a decrease in Beclin 1, AKT, and phospho-AKT proteins. CONCLUSION: CuMy-12 can be considered a natural candidate with anticancer activity for autophagy-based regulation, but mechanistic and clinical studies are required to validate its potential.",

Neuroprotectants are clinically used to reduce neuronal apoptosis in ischemic stroke. However, the current neuroprotectants have multiple limitations. Myricetin is beneficial for multiple neurodegenerative diseases, but the role of myricetin as a neuroprotective agent in ischemic stroke is still not fully understood. METHODS AND RESULTS: Middle cerebral artery occlusion, Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling staining and Western blots were used to explore the anti-apoptotic effects of myricetin in vivo. Flow cytometry, Western blots and Ca2+ staining were used to study the neuroprotective effects of myricetin in vitro. In this study, we first demonstrated that myricetin reduced neuronal apoptosis after ischemia in vivo and in vitro. And, among the factors of apoptosis after ischemic stroke, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and inflammation-induced apoptosis can be alleviated by myricetin. Moreover, we further demonstrated that myricetin was able to improve neuronal intrinsic apoptosis by inhibiting the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase in the oxygen and glucose deprivation in vitro.

      "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, inflammatory cutaneous disorder. Obesity is associated with increased prevalence and severity of AD for reasons that remain poorly understood. Myricetin, a dietary flavonoid found in fruits and vegetables, is known to have anti-inflammatory effects, but its role in AD is unclear. Thus, we investigated the effects of obesity on exacerbation AD lesions and evaluated the effects of myricetin on obese AD. Mice were fed normal diet (ND) or high-fat diet, and then 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene was used to induce AD-like lesions. We found that obesity exacerbated AD lesions, and myricetin topical administration ameliorated symptoms and skin lesions of obsess AD mice, such as dermatitis scores, scratching behavior, epidermal thickness, and mast cell infiltration. In addition, myricetin reduced the levels of immunoglobulin E and histamine, inhibited the infiltration of CD4+T cells, and modulated the expression of Th1, Th2, Th17, and Th22 cytokines and pro-inflammatory factors (CCL17, CCL22, IL-1β, and TGF-β). Moreover, myricetin restored impaired barrier function by reducing transepidermal water loss, increasing lamellar body secretion, as well as upregulating the mRNA and protein expression of filaggrin. Western blot results showed that significantly increased levels of phosphorylated IκB and NF-κB p65 was observed in the obese AD mice compared with the AD mice fed ND, whereas the myricetin could downregulated the phosphorylations of IκB and NF-κB, and inhibited mRNA expression of iNOS and COX2. Taken together, our results suggest that myricetin treatment exhibits potentially protective effects against the obeseassociated AD by inhibiting inflammatory response and restoring skin barrier function.",

Pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of M10 and its metabolite myricetin were compared in normal mice and in dextran-sodium-sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis mice. The role of fecal microbiota was also analyzed during metabolism of M10 in vitro. After oral administration, M10 was very low in the plasma of both normal and diseased mice. However, both M10 and myricetin were mainly distributed in the gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach, colon and small intestine, in physiological and pathological conditions. Significantly, M10 and myricetin were found in higher levels in gastrointestinal tracts with inflamed tissues than in normal tissues of mice. An in vitro assay revealed that 80% of M10 was metabolized to myricetin via fecal microbiota. After oral administration, M10 was not absorbed into circulation but mainly distributed in the inflamed submucosal tissues of colitic mice, where it was metabolized into myricetin to prevent colitis development.",

      "abstract": "Triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation and oxidative damage in hepatocytes induced by high circulating concentrations of fatty acids (FA) are common after calving. In order to clarify the role of myricetin on lipid metabolism in hepatocytes when FA metabolism increases markedly, we performed in vitro analyses using isolated primary calf hepatocytes from three healthy female calves (1 d old, 42 to 48 kg). Two hours prior to an FA challenge (1.2 mM mix), the hepatocytes were treated with 100 μM (M1), 50 μM (M2), or 25 μM (M3) of myricetin. Subsequently, hepatocytes from each donor were challenged with or without FA for 12 h in an attempt to induce metabolic stress. Data from calf hepatocyte treatment comparisons were assessed using two-way repeated-measures (RM) ANOVA with subsequent Bonferroni correction. The data revealed that hepatocytes challenged with FA had greater concentrations of TAG and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), oxidative stress-related MDA and H2O2, and mRNA and protein abundance of lipid synthesis-related SREBF1 and inflammatory-related NF-κB. In addition, the mRNA abundance of the lipid synthesis-related genes FASN, DGAT1, DGAT2, and ACC1; endoplasmic reticulum stress-related GRP79 and PERK; and inflammatory-related TNF-α also were upregulated. In contrast, the activity of antioxidant SOD (p < 0.01) and concentrations of GSH (p < 0.05), and the protein abundance of mitochondrial FA oxidation-related CPT1A, were markedly lower. Compared with FA challenge, 50 and 100 μM myricetin led to lower concentrations of TAG, NEFA, MDA, and H2O2, as well as mRNA and protein abundance of SREBF1, DGAT1, GRP78, and NF-κB. In contrast, the activity of SOD (p < 0.01) and mRNA and protein abundance of CPT1A were markedly greater. Overall, the results suggest that myricetin could enhance the antioxidant capacity and reduce lipotoxicity, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and inflammation. All of these effects can help reduce TAG accumulation in hepatocytes."

Sleep deprivation (SD) can lead to memory impairment and neuroinflammation, and there remains no effective pharmacological treatment for these effects. Myricetin (MYR) is a common natural flavonoid that has various pharmacological activities. In this study, we investigated the effects of MYR on memory impairment, neuroinflammation, and neurotrophic factors in sleep-deprived rats. We analyzed SD-induced cognitive and spatial memory, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokine levels during SD. SD model rats were intraperitoneally injected with 10 and 20 mg/kg/day MYR for 14 days. MYR administration significantly ameliorated SD-induced cognitive and spatial memory deficits; it also attenuated the SD-induced inflammatory response associated with nuclear factor kappa B activation in the hippocampus. In addition, MYR enhanced the mRNA expression of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus. Our results showed that MYR improved memory impairment by means of anti-inflammatory activity and appropriate regulation of BDNF expression. Our findings suggest that MYR is a potential functional ingredient that protects cognitive function from SD."

      "abstract": "Each biopharmaceutical research and new drug development investigation is targeted at discovering novel and potent medications for managing specific ailments. Thus, to discover and develop new potent medications, it should be performed sequentially or step by step. This is because drug development is a lengthy and risky work that requires significant money, resources, and labor. Breast and lung cancer contributes to the death of millions of people throughout the world each year, according to the report of the World Health Organization, and has been a public threat worldwide, although the global medical sector is developed and updated day by day. However, no proper treatment has been found until now. Therefore, this research has been conducted to find a new bioactive molecule to treat breast and lung cancer-such as natural myricetin and its derivatives-by using the latest and most authentic computer-aided drug-design approaches. At the beginning of this study, the biological pass prediction spectrum was calculated to select the target protein. It is noted that the probability of active (Pa) score is better in the antineoplastic (Pa: 0.788-0.938) in comparison with antiviral (Pa: 0.236-0.343), antibacterial (Pa: 0.274-0.421), and antifungal (Pa: 0.226-0.508). Thus, cancerous proteins, such as in breast and lung cancer, were picked up, and the computational investigation was continued. Furthermore, the docking score was found to be -7.3 to -10.4 kcal/mol for breast cancer (standard epirubicin hydrochloride, -8.3 kcal/mol), whereas for lung cancer, the score was -8.2 to -9.6 kcal/mol (standard carboplatin, -5.5 kcal/mol). The docking score is the primary concern, revealing that myricetin derivatives have better docking scores than standard chemotherapeutic agents epirubicin hydrochloride and carboplatin. Finally, drug-likeness, ADME, and toxicity prediction were fulfilled in this investigation, and it is noted that all the derivatives were highly soluble in a water medium, whereas they were totally free from AMES toxicity, hepatotoxicity, and skin sensitization, excluding only ligands 1 and 7. Thus, we proposed that the natural myricetin derivatives could be a better inhibitor for treating breast and lung cancer.",

      "abstract": "The creation of novel anticancer treatments for a variety of human illnesses, including different malignancies and dangerous microbes, also potentially depends on nanoparticles including silver. Recently, it has been successful to biologically synthesize metal nanoparticles using plant extracts. The natural flavonoid 3,3', 4', 5,5', and 7 hexahydroxyflavon (myricetin) has anticancer properties. There is not much known about the regulatory effects of myricetin on the possible cell fate-determination mechanisms (such as apoptosis/proliferation) in colorectal cancer. Because the majority of investigations related to the anticancer activity of myricetin have dominantly focused on the enhancement of tumor cell uncontrolled growth (i.e., apoptosis). Thus, we have decided to explore the potential myricetin interactors and the associated biological functions by using an in-silico approach. Then, we focused on the main goal of the work which involved the synthesis of silver nanoparticles and the labeling of myricetin with it. The synthesized silver nanoparticles were examined using UV-visible spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. In this study, we have investigated the effects of myricetin on colorectal cancer where numerous techniques were used to show myricetin's effect on colon cancer cells. Transmission Electron Microscopy was employed to monitor morphological changes. Furthermore, we have combined the results of the colorectal cancer gene expression dataset with those of the myricetin interactors and pathways. Based on the results, we conclude that myricetin is able to efficiently kill human colorectal cancer cell lines. Since, it shares important biological roles and possible route components and this myricetin may be a promising herbal treatment for colorectal cancer as per an in-silico analysis of the TCGA dataset.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer is still a severe origin of malignant demise in females, and its prevalence is rising worldwide. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a diversified aggressive breast tumor distinguished by inadequate prognosis, early recurrence, high invasion, and extremely metastasized disease. Chemotherapy is being used to treat it; however, it has low efficacy. On the other hand, with the growing number of corroborations on subtypes of TNBC and molecular biology of tumors, significant advancement in TNBC targeted treatment has been made. Myricetin (MYR), a polyhydroxyflavonol compound widely found in nature, has been shown to possess anticancer effects in various cancers. Though, the mechanisms and impacts of MYR on metastasis of TNBC remain unclear. Early and late apoptotic cell death and cell proliferation inhibition were observed in MYR-treated TNBC cells. MYR modulated cell cycle, pro-angiogenic, and invasion effects via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Protein kinase B (PKB/also known as AKT) signaling pathways. Moreover, it regulates the expression of MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, IκB/NF-κB, Hippo, STAT3, GSK-3β, Nrf2/HO-1, TLR, eNOS / NO, ACE, and AChE. Here, we review the anticancer effects of MYR for TNBC and target the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway as a therapeutic target for the fruitful treatment of TNBC to summarize MYR's therapeutic potential.",

      "abstract": "Myricetin, a polyhydroxyflavone compound, is one of the main ingredients of various human foods and therefore also known as dietary flavonoids. Due to the continuous emergence of resistant strains of herpesviruses, novel control measures are required. In the present study, myricetin exhibited potent antiviral activity against pseudorabies virus (PRV), a model organism of herpesvirus. The suppression rate could reach up to 96.4% at a concentration of 500 μM in cells, and the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 42.69 μM. Moreover, the inhibitory activity was not attenuated by the increased amount of infective dose, and a significant reduction of intracellular PRV virions was observed by indirect immunofluorescence. A mode of action study indicated that myricetin could directly inactivate the virus in vitro, leading to inhibition of viral adsorption, penetration and replication in cells. In addition to direct killing effect, myricetin could also activate host antiviral defense through regulation of apoptosis-related gene expressions (Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, Bax), NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways and cytokine gene expressions (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, c-Jun, STAT1, c-Fos, and c-Myc). In PRV-infected mouse model, myricetin could enhance the survival rate by 40% at 5 days post infection, and viral loads in kidney, liver, lung, spleen, and brain were significantly decreased. The pathological changes caused by PRV infection were improved by myricetin treatment. The gene expressions of inflammatory factors (MCP-1, G-CSF, IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-6) and apoptotic factors (Bcl-xl, Bcl-2, and Bax) were regulated by myricetin in PRV-infected mice. The present findings suggest that myricetin can effectively inhibit PRV infection and become a candidate for development of new anti-herpesvirus drugs."

Myricetin, a flavonoid compound, is well documented for its numerous pharmacological activities. However, the impact of myricetin on the atrazine-mediated dysfunctional hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is not known. This study investigated the role of myricetin on the atrazine-induced alterations in the male reproductive axis in rats orally gavaged with ATZ alone (50 mg/kg) or co-treated with ATZ + myricetin (MYR) at 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg for 30 consecutive days. Myricetin assuaged ATZ-induced reductions in intra-testicular testosterone, serum follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and testosterone, coupled with decreases in alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities. Also, MYR treatment improved epididymal sperm count and motility and decreased sperm defects in ATZ-treated rats. Testicular sperm number, daily sperm production, and sperm viability remained unchanged in all treatment groups. Administration of MYR abated ATZ-mediated depletion in antioxidant status, an increase in myeloperoxidase activity, nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide, malondialdehyde levels, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, as well as the histological lesions in the hypothalamus, epididymis, and testes of treated animals. All in all, MYR mitigated atrazine-mediated functional changes in the reproductive axis via anti-inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms in atrazine-exposed rats. Dietary intake of MYR could be a worthy chemoprotective approach against reproductive dysfunction related to ATZ exposure.",

These proteins have become potential biomarkers for cancer treatment, and their agonists are likely to become a new direction in research and development of antitumor drugs. In this study, we found that myricetin has an inhibitory effect on lung cancer cells of the activation of pyroptosis. Analysis of the expression of Gasdermin family proteins revealed that this phenomenon was caused by the cleavage of GSDME. Subsequently, specific inhibitors, we found that caspase-3 was its upstream activation factor. In addition, mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) analysis showed that myricetin can cause endoplasmic reticulum stress and increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Subsequent inhibition of caspase-12 revealed that the expression levels of cleaved-caspase-3 and cleaved-GSDME were significantly reduced, resulting in the inhibition of pyroptosis. Using in vivo experiments, we also found that the treatment with myricetin can reduce tumor volume and significantly increase the level of pyroptosis-related proteins in tumor tissues. Overall, our findings show that myricetin induces cell death of lung cancer cells primarily through an ER stress pathway-induced pyroptosis. Therefore, myricetin has the potential to be used as a pyroptosis agonist in research and development of antitumor drugs."

      "abstract": "To verify the role of myricetin in alleviating the symptoms of type 2 diabetes and regulating the intestinal flora, we established a type 2 diabetes mouse model. After being fed a high-fat and high-sugar diet for six weeks, mice were intraperitoneally injected with streptozotocin (80 mg/kg body weight [BW]) 2-3 times. Type 2 diabetes mice were randomly divided into type 2 diabetes control (T2DM) and myricetin intervention groups. Water and food intake, fasting blood glucose (FBG), and BW were monitored weekly. After six weeks of myricetin administration, superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels and blood lipid content were measured. Furthermore, 16S rRNA sequencing was used to detect the gut microbiota composition. FBG and blood lipid levels of T2DM mice were significantly reduced upon myricetin treatment, while SOD levels were increased. Myricetin improved polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria, and weight loss in T2DM mice. In addition, the signature type 2 diabetes microflora was established by analyzing the microflora structure of healthy mice, type 2 diabetes mice, and mice treated with myricetin. Results showed that type 2 diabetes disrupted the mice intestinal flora, and myricetin intervention normalized the intestinal flora. In conclusion, our results indicate that myricetin alleviates type 2 diabetes in mice and regulates the intestinal microflora.",

      "abstract": "Two flavonols quercetin and myricetin were assessed for their in vitro activities to attenuate the acrylamide-induced cytotoxicity and barrier loss in rat intestinal epithelial (IEC-6) cells and to identify whether heat treatment of the flavonols might cause activity changes. The results showed that the flavonols could alleviate the acrylamide-caused cell injury, resulting in higher cell viability, lower lactate dehydrogenase release, and less formation of reactive oxygen species. Meanwhile, the flavonols could antagonize the acrylamide-induced barrier dysfunction via decreasing the paracellular permeability, increasing the transepithelial resistance of cell monolayer, and enhancing the expression of three tight junction proteins namely occludin, claudin-1, and zonula occludens-1. The flavonols also could down-regulate the expression of JNK/Src proteins and thus cause lower relative protein ratios of p-JNK/JNK and p-Src/Src, resulting in a suppressed JNK/Src activation. Totally, quercetin was more potent than myricetin to exert these assessed activities, while the heated flavonols obtained lower activity than the unheated ones. It is thus concluded that the flavonols had beneficial activities towards the intestinal epithelial cells with acrylamide exposure by alleviating the acrylamide-induced cytotoxicity and barrier disruption, while heat treatment of the flavonols was unfavorable because it led to a reduced flavonol activity to the cells.",

Despite gathering massive insight into the mysteries of tumor heterogeneity and the molecular framework of tumor cells, therapy resistance and adverse side effects of current therapeutic remain the major challenge. This has shifted the attention towards therapeutics with less toxicity and high efficacy. Myricetin a natural flavonoid has been under the spotlight for its anti-cancer, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. The cutting-edge molecular techniques have shed light on the interplay between myricetin and dysregulated signaling cascades in cancer progression, invasion, and metastasis. However, there are limited data available regarding the nano-delivery platforms composed of myricetin in cancer. In this review, we have provided a comprehensive detail of myricetin-mediated regulation of different cellular pathways, its implications in cancer prevention, preclinical and clinical trials, and its current available nano-formulations for the treatment of various cancers."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Among the flavonoids, Myricetin (MCN) has negligible side effects and anti-cancer properties. However, the therapeutic potential of MCN has been limited mainly by its low bioavailability. Nanocarriers improve the bioavailability and stability of flavonoids. The toxic effects of MCN loaded in solid lipid nanoparticles (MCN-SLNs) on the HT-29 human colorectal cancer cells were investigated in this study. METHODS AND RESULTS: HT-29 cells were exposed to the 30 µmol MCN or MCN-SLNs for 24 h. Colony formation, cell viability, apoptosis, and expression of the Bax, Bcl-2, and AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor) have been investigated. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were also measured. The MCN-SLNs with appropriate characteristics and a slow sustained MCN release until 48 h made. MCN-SLNs could diminish colony numbers and survival of the HT-29 cells. The apoptosis index of MCN-SLNs-treated cells significantly increased compared to the free MCN (p < 0.001). The expression of Bax and AIF were elevated (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively) while Bcl-2 expression was decreased in MCN-SLNs treatment (p < 0.05). Moreover, MCN-SLNs significantly enhanced the ROS formation and reduced MMP compared to the free MCN-treated cells (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The SLN formulation of MCN can effectively induce colon cancer cell death by raising ROS formation and activating the apoptosis process.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute liver injury (ALI) is a critical and fatal disorder associated with excessive oxidative stress and inflammation, ultimately leading to the death of hepatocytes. Myricetin is a bioflavonoid in some berries, including blueberries and strawberries, with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties. OBJECTIVE: In the current research, the hepatoprotective potential of myricetin was studied in the LPS/D-GalN model of ALI in C57BL/6 mice. METHODS: For inducing liver injury, D-GalN (400 mg/kg) and LPS (50 µg/kg) were injected via intraperitoneal route and myricetin was orally administered (25 or 100 mg/kg/day) for two days before inducing injury. Functional indices of liver dysfunction along with hepatic apoptotic, autophagic, oxidative stress and inflammatory factors were measured. RESULTS: Myricetin (100 mg/kg) reduced the fatality rate of animals and pathological liver changes and suitably lowered serum levels of total bilirubin, 8-OH-dG, ALT, AST and ALP in addition to decreasing apoptotic, oxidative and inflammatory factors, NOX, NLRP3, caspase 3, MPO and enhancing some antioxidants. Besides, myricetin improved the hepatic level and activity of sirtuin 1 and reversed inappropriate alterations of autophagic parameters, including LC3 II, Beclin 1, and P62. The beneficial effects of myricetin were attenuated after co-treatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3- methyladenine. CONCLUSION: This study indicates the hepatoprotective potential of myricetin that can be ascribed to its down-regulation of oxidative, apoptotic, and inflammatory factors and upregulation of antioxidants besides its partial regulation of sirtuin 1 and autophagic pathway.",

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of myricetin on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our results showed that myricetin significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in HCC cells. The apoptosis induced by myricetin was associated with the activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In addition, autophagy was enhanced in response to ER stress. Inhibition of autophagy by RNA interference or chemical inhibitors resulted in increased apoptosis in myricetin-treated HCC cells. The in vivo experiment also showed that myricetin effectively reduced tumor growth in an HCC xenograft model and that combination treatment with an autophagy inhibitor significantly enhanced this effect. These results indicated that myricetin induced apoptosis in HCC cells through the activation of ER stress. Protective autophagy was also upregulated during this process. Simultaneous inhibition of autophagy enhanced the anti-HCC activity of myricetin. Myricetin might be a promising drug candidate for HCC therapy, and the combined use of myricetin with autophagy inhibitors could be an effective therapeutic strategy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myricetin (Myr) is a flavonoid compound that exist widely in many natural plants. Myr has been proven to have multiple biological functions, including immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. PURPOSE: In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of Myr on calcipotriol (MC903) induced atopic dermatitis (AD) mouse model and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α/interferon (IFN)-γ stimulated human immortal keratinocyte line (HaCaT) in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: MC903 was applied topically to the left ears of mice to establish AD mouse model. After the AD model established successfully, the cream base, dexamethasone (DEX) cream or Myr cream were applied on the lesions of mice for 8 days. Through measuring ear thickness and scoring dermatitis severity, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of Myr, the draining lymph nodes (DLNs) and ears of the mice were collected for mechanistic study. In addition, TNF-α and IFN-γ-activated HaCaT cells were used to investigate the underlying mechanism. RESULTS: Our data demonstrated that Myr alleviated the symptoms of AD by exerting anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic functions in vivo. We found that Myr treatment suppressed ear swelling and IgE level in the serum, reduced the infiltration of mast cells in skin lesions, decreased expressions of thymus and activation regulated chemokine (TARC), IL-4, IFN-γ and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in ear lesions, increased the expressions of filaggrin (FLG). Furthermore, our experimental results demonstrated that Myr down-regulated the mRNA expressions of T-bet and GATA-3 in DLNs. In vitro, Myr treatment decreased MDC and TARC expressions in IFN-γ and TNF-α-induced HaCaT cells by blocking the NF-κB and STAT1 signal pathway. CONCLUSION: The present study is the first to investigate the anti-atopic effects of Myr. Our findings suggested the therapeutic effects of Myr against MC903-induced AD-like skin lesions in mice. Therefore, Myr may be a potential therapeutic agent for AD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with sustained androgen receptor (AR) signaling remains a critical clinical challenge, despite androgen depletion therapy. The Jumonji C-containing histone lysine demethylase family 4 (KDM4) members, KDM4A‒KDM4C, serve as critical coactivators of AR to promote tumor growth in prostate cancer and are candidate therapeutic targets to overcome AR mutations/alterations-mediated resistance in CRPC. METHODS: In this study, using a structure-based approach, we identified a natural product, myricetin, able to block the demethylation of histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation by KDM4 members and evaluated its effects on CRPC. A structure-based screening was employed to search for a natural product that inhibited KDM4B. Inhibition kinetics of myricetin was determined. The cytotoxic effect of myricetin on various prostate cancer cells was evaluated. The combined effect of myricetin with enzalutamide, a second-generation AR inhibitor toward C4-2B, a CRPC cell line, was assessed. To improve bioavailability, myricetin encapsulated by poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA), the US food and drug administration (FDA)-approved material as drug carriers, was synthesized and its antitumor activity alone or with enzalutamide was evaluated using in vivo C4-2B xenografts. RESULTS: Myricetin was identified as a potent α-ketoglutarate-type inhibitor that blocks the demethylation activity by KDM4s and significantly reduced the proliferation of both androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and androgen-independent CRPC (CWR22Rv1 and C4-2B). A synergistic cytotoxic effect toward C4-2B was detected for the combination of myricetin and enzalutamide. PLGA-myricetin, enzalutamide, and the combined treatment showed significantly greater antitumor activity than that of the control group in the C4-2B xenograft model. Tumor growth was significantly lower for the combination treatment than for enzalutamide or myricetin treatment alone. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that myricetin is a pan-KDM4 inhibitor and exhibited potent cell cytotoxicity toward CRPC cells. Importantly, the combination of PLGA-encapsulated myricetin with enzalutamide is potentially effective for CRPC.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease characterized by hyperglycemia, and oxidative stress is an important cause and therapeutic target of DM. Phytochemicals such as flavonols are important natural antioxidants that can be used for prevention and treatment of DM. In the present study, six flavonols were precisely prepared and structurally elucidated from Morella rubra leaves, which were screened based on antioxidant assays and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities of different plant tissues. Myricetin-3-O-(2″-O-galloyl)-α-L-rhamnoside (2) and myricetin-3-O-(4″-O-galloyl)-α-L-rhamnoside (3) showed excellent α-glucosidase inhibitory effects with IC50 values of 1.32 and 1.77 μM, respectively, which were hundredfold higher than those of positive control acarbose. Molecular docking simulation illustrated that the presence of galloyl group altered the binding orientation of flavonols, where it occupied the opening of the cavity pocket of α-glucosidase along with Pi-anion interaction with Glu304 and Pi-Pi stacked with His279. Pi-conjugations generated between galloyl moiety and key residues at the active site of α-glucosidase reinforced the flavonol-enzyme binding, which might explain the greatly increased activity of compounds 2 and 3. In addition, 26 flavonols were evaluated for systematic analysis of structure-activity relationship (SAR) between flavonols and α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. By using their pIC50 (-log IC50) values, three-dimensional quantitative SAR (3D-QSAR) models were developed via comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative similarity index analysis (CoMSIA), both of which were validated to possess high accuracy and predictive power as indicated by the reasonable cross-validated coefficient (q 2) and non-cross-validated coefficient (r 2) values. Through analyzing 3D contour maps of both CoMFA and CoMSIA models, QSAR results were in agreement with in vitro experimental data. Therefore, such results showed that the galloyl group in compounds 2 and 3 is crucial for interacting with key residues of α-glucosidase and the established 3D-QSAR models could provide valuable information for the prediction of flavonols with great antidiabetic potential.",

On the other hand, CYP2C8 is not only crucial for alteration in the pharmacokinetics of drugs to cause drug interaction but also unequivocally important for the metabolism of endogenous substances like the formation of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which are considered as signaling molecules against hallmarks of cancer. However, there is hardly any information known to date about the effect of myricetin on CYP2C8 inhibition and, subsequently, the CYP2C8-mediated drug interaction potential of myricetin at the preclinical/clinical level. We aimed here to explore the CYP2C8 inhibitory potential of myricetin using in silico, in vitro, and in vivo investigations. In the in vitro study, myricetin showed a substantial effect on CYP2C8 inhibition in human liver microsomes using CYP2C8-catalyzed amodiaquine-N-deethylation as an index reaction. Considering the Lineweaver-Burk plot, the Dixon plot, and the higher α-value, myricetin is found to be a mixed type of CYP2C8 inhibitor. Moreover, in vitro-in vivo extrapolation data suggest that myricetin is likely to cause drug interaction at the hepatic level. The molecular docking study depicted a strong interaction between myricetin and the active site of the human CYP2C8 enzyme. Moreover, myricetin caused considerable elevation in the oral exposure of amodiaquine as a CYP2C8 substrate via a slowdown of amodiaquine clearance in the rat model. Overall, the potent action of myricetin on CYP2C8 inhibition indicates that there is a need for further exploration to avoid drug interaction-mediated precipitation of obvious adverse effects as well as to optimize anticancer therapy."

In this field, flavonoids are known to modulate a wide panel of mechanisms involved in tumorigenesis, thus rendering them worthy candidates for both cancer prevention and treatment. In particular, it was reported that flavonoids regulate apoptosis, as well as hamper migration and proliferation, crucial events for the progression of cancer. In this review, we collect recent evidence concerning the anti-cancer properties of the flavonols myricetin and kaempferol, discussing their mechanisms of action to give a thorough overview of their noteworthy capabilities, which are comparable to those of their most famous analogue, namely quercetin. On the whole, these flavonols possess great potential, and hence further study is highly advised to allow a proper definition of their pharmaco-toxicological profile and assess their potential use in protocols of chemoprevention and adjuvant therapies.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the antioxidant activities of Sasa quelpaertensis Nakai extract (SQE), p-coumaric acid (PCA) and myricetin (MY), and their effects on the in vitro maturation and developmental ability of porcine oocytes. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) showed that 1 mg of SQE contained 3.92 μg of PCA and 0.19 μg of MY. The concentrations required to inhibit 50% of DPPH radicals were 2732.8 ppm, 38.8 mg/mL, and 0.110 mg/mL for SQE, PCA, and MY, respectively. The reducing power increased as the concentration increased, and the reducing power of MY was higher than that of PCA. The polar body extrusion rate was highest upon treatment with 1250 ppm SQE and 10 μM MY. The reactive oxygen species and glutathione levels were significantly decreased and increased, respectively. In a normal or peroxidative environment, the embryo development rate upon parthenogenetic activation was increased, and the total cell number, apoptosis rate, and development-related gene expression were altered to enhance embryonic development. The embryo development rate and total cell number upon somatic cell nuclear transfer did not differ between the groups. These results show that the antioxidant effects of SQE and MY enhance the in vitro maturation and subsequent embryonic development.",

      "abstract": "Myricetin, a flavonoid found in fruits and vegetables, is known to have antioxidant and anticancer effects. However, the anticancer effects of myricetin on SK‑BR‑3 human breast cancer cells have not been elucidated. In the present study, the anticancer effects of myricetin were confirmed in human breast cancer SK‑BR‑3 cells. As the concentration of myricetin increased, the cell viability decreased. DAPI (4',6‑diamidino‑2‑phenylindole) and Annexin V/PI staining also revealed a significant increase in apoptotic bodies and apoptosis. Western blot analysis was performed to confirm the myricetin‑induced expression of apoptosis‑related proteins. The levels of cleaved PARP and Bax proteins were increased, and that of Bcl‑2 was decreased. The levels of proteins in the mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway were examined to confirm the mechanism of myricetin‑induced apoptosis, and it was found that the expression levels of phosphorylated c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase (p‑JNK) and phosphorylated mitogen‑activated protein kinases (p‑p38) were increased, whereas that of phosphorylated extracellular‑regulated kinase (p‑ERK) was decreased. It was also demonstrated that myricetin induced autophagy by promoting autophagy‑related proteins such as microtubule‑associated protein 1A/1B‑light chain 3 (LC 3) and beclin 1. In addition, 3‑methyladenine (3‑MA) was used to evaluate the association between cell viability and autophagy in cells treated with myricetin. The results showed that simultaneous treatment with 3‑MA and myricetin promoted the apoptosis of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, treatment with a JNK inhibitor reduced cell viability, promoted Bax expression, and reduced the expression of p‑JNK, Bcl‑2, and LC 3‑II/I. These results suggest that myricetin induces apoptosis via the MAPK pathway and regulates JNK‑mediated autophagy in SK‑BR‑3 cells. In conclusion, myricetin shows potential as a natural anticancer agent in SK‑BR‑3 cells.",

      "abstract": "Myricetin is a common plant-derived flavonoid, considered an agonist of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor. It improves glycemic control and helps reduce body weight in diabetic subjects. The potential mechanisms of action of myricetin in this context might be enhancing the secretion of β-endorphin (BER) to activate peripheral μ-opioid receptors. Moreover, adropin is a nutritionally regulated peptide hormone, which regulates energy metabolism, and plays a role in ameliorating diabetes. Because their mechanisms of insulin sensitivity are closely related, we hypothesized that myricetin may interact with adropin and plasma BER. The present study investigated the glucose-lowering effect of acute and chronic treatments of myricetin in type-1 diabetic rats. Plasma BER and adropin levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The secretion of BER was measured in rats who received adrenalectomy. The changes in adropin gene (Enho) or mRNA level of GLP-1 receptor were measured using qPCR analysis. The results showed that myricetin dose-dependently increased plasma BER and adropin levels like the reduction of hyperglycemia after bolus injection as acute treatment. In addition, these effects of myricetin were inhibited by the antagonist of GLP-1 receptor. Moreover, in HepG2 cell line, myricetin induced GLP-1 receptor activation, which modulated the expression of adropin. In diabetic rats, the plasma adropin increased by myricetin is mainly through endogenous β-endorphin after activation of GLP-1 receptor via bolus injection as acute treatment. Additionally, chronic treatment with myricetin increased adropin secretion in diabetic rats. In conclusion, our results provide a new finding that activation of opioid μ-receptor in the liver may enhance circulating adropin in animals."

      "abstract": "Purpose: The current investigation was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of myricetin in ethanol-induced liver toxicity in Wistar rats. Research Design: Twenty-four rats were randomly divided into four groups with six animals per group. Group-I animals were administered with vehicle (distilled water), Group II, III, and IV were treated orally with sequential (per week) increase in the dose of ethanol (5, 8, 10, and 12 g/kg b wt per week in each group) for 28 days. Myricetin was treated orally to Group-III and IV animals at the respective doses of 25 mg/kg b wt. and 50 mg/kg b wt. Results: Our results showed that myricetin prevented hepatotoxicity by modulating the production of free radicals, ethanol metabolizing enzymes, and inflammatory markers in vivo. Myricetin also helped maintain lipid membrane integrity, oxidant-antioxidant status, and histoarchitecture. Ethanol administration caused elevation in XO, ADH, and CYP2E1 in hepatic tissue, which significantly normalized with myricetin administration. After ethanol administration, there was a steep increase in the hepatotoxicity biomarkers, including ALT, MDA, and AST. The level of cytotoxicity marker LDH also increased after ethanol administration; myricetin administration decreased the level of all these markers. Moreover, myricetin treatment also reduced ethanol-induced inflammatory markers such as NF-κB and IL-6. Conclusion: Findings from the current study demonstrate that myricetin administration prevents alcohol-induced hepatic injury by influencing the metabolism of ethanol, inhibiting oxidative stress, maintaining lipid profile, and suppressing inflammatory markers.",
