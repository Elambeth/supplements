      "abstract": "This study was performed by Cano Contreras et al, who explored the effects of alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) and Silybum marianum (SM) supplementation combined with a mediterranean diet (MD) on metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). The randomized controlled design and use of transient elastography provide methodological strengths, whereas the focus on a Mexican cohort addresses a critical gap in regional MASLD research. Although improvements in visceral fat and controlled attenuation parameters (CAP) were observed, key metabolic markers, including transaminases and lipid profiles, showed no significant changes, raising concerns about the intervention's comprehensive metabolic impact. The reliance on CAP and the absence of mechanistic biomarker analysis limit insights into the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pathways of ALA and SM. Future research should explore synergistic effects with other nutraceuticals, such as vitamin E and polyphenols, and include extended follow-up and patient stratification to assess long-term benefits and personalized therapeutic outcomes. Addressing these limitations could solidify the role of nutraceuticals in MASLD management and enable the development of more effective and sustainable interventions."

      "abstract": "Adolescent obesity and inadequate dietary habits remain pressing public health concerns in Portugal, particularly among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. Food literacy has emerged as a critical framework for promoting healthier eating behaviors; however, school-based interventions are rarely culturally grounded or theoretically structured. This narrative review synthesizes the experiential strategies described in the literature to improve adolescent food literacy in school settings. It provides a conceptual foundation for and supports the design rationale of FOODWISELab: The Mediterranean Diet Experience-a school-based intervention aligned with Mediterranean diet principles and specifically tailored to the Portuguese educational context. Findings from the literature-emphasizing the value of school gardens, cooking classes, digital tools, and curricular integration-guided the development of FOODWISELab: The Mediterranean Diet Experience, a comprehensive intervention designed for implementation in public secondary schools in Portugal. The proposed protocol bridges the gap between research and practice by offering a structured, context-sensitive model built around four core pedagogical domains: planning, selecting, preparing, and eating. It integrates multiple components, including hands-on learning, family and community involvement, and robust evaluation strategy. FOODWISELab addresses the well-documented gap in adolescent food literacy by delivering a feasible, culturally relevant, and replicable intervention. The anchored Mediterranean dietary model aims to promote adolescent health, sustainability, and cultural heritage in both the urban and rural educational contexts. By presenting a detailed and actionable protocol, this review enhances the practical value of food literacy research and offers strategic guidance for future educational and public health initiatives.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sexual dysfunctions (SD) are highly prevalent in Chronic Liver Diseases (CLD). Whether Metabolic dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) carries a higher risk of SD is unknown as is the role of dietary patterns or quality of Life (QoL). AIM: to assess (1) prevalence of SD in CLD; (2) whether MASLD is a risk factor for SD; (3) the role of adherence to Mediterranean Diet (MD) or QoL. METHODS: Observational, cross-sectional study, 207 CLD patients (84 females and 123 males), median age 57 years (IQR:46-63); 96 (46.4%) MASLD; and 111 (53.6%) nonMASLD. OUTCOMES: SD were assessed through Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaires. Adherence to MD was evaluated by the MD Score, QoL by SFHS-12 questionnaire evaluating physical [(ie, Physical Component Summary (PCS)] and mental [(ie, Mental Component Summary (MCS)] health. Multivariate analysis identified predictors of SD. RESULTS: (1) SD prevalence in CLD was 157/207 (75.8%); 80.9% females were at risk for SD, altered sexual desire/arousal and dyspareunia being the most common complaints, whereas 72.3% males had erectile dysfunction (ED); (2) prevalence of SD was higher in MASLD (89%) than in nonMASLD (64%) (P < 0.001); (3) in females, at univariate analysis, a negative correlation was found between FSFI and age, hypertension, or MASLD; (4) in males, at univariate analysis, IIEF-ED negatively correlated with age, DM2, or MASLD, whereas positively correlated with PCS and MCS; (5) in females, at multivariate analysis BMI (OR = 0.779,CI 95% = 0.640-0.948) and MCS (OR = 0.840,CI 95% = 0.741-0.953) were protective against SD, whereas age (OR = 1.115,CI 95% = 1.040-1.263) and DM2 (OR = 120.894,CI 95% = 1.396-10 741) were predictive of SD; (6) in males, at multivariate analysis, age (OR = 1088,CI 95% = 1032-1.148) and MASLD (OR = 4.075,CI 95% = 1.120-14.828) were risk factors for, whereas PCS (OR = 0,928,CI 95% = 0,865-0,995), and disease duration (OR = 0.393,CI 95% = 0.187-0.822) were protective against SD; 7) MD adherence, while higher in nonMASLD vs MASLD (P = 0.004), was not an independent protective factor against SD. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: SD should not be underestimated in CLD patients, in particular those with MASLD. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: Comprehensive study evaluating SD in a large cohort of CLD patients of both sexes, comparing MASLD vs nonMASLD. Due to its cross-sectional design, no conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. CONCLUSIONS: (1) CLD, in particular MASLD, have a high prevalence of SD which is not affected by MD adherence, whereas QoL seems to play a role; (2) CLD patients should be evaluated for SD, for early diagnosis and treatment."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Mediterranean diet (MD) has been proposed as a dietary therapy for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) but its efficacy remains unclear. We compared the efficacy of MD to a diet low in fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols (LFD). METHODS: In this pilot-feasibility, randomized controlled trial (RCT), adult patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) or mixed bowel pattern (IBS-M) were randomized to MD versus LFD for 4 weeks. Meals were provided for both groups (ModifyHealth, GA). Daily variables included abdominal pain intensity (API) and bloating, while IBS symptom severity score (IBS-SSS) and IBS adequate relief (IBS-AR) were scored weekly. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with ≥ 30% decrease in API for ≥ 2/4 weeks. RESULTS: Of 26 randomized patients, 20 finished the study (10 per group). Seventy-three percent of the MD group met the primary endpoint compared to 81.8% of the LFD group (p = 1.0). Although not statistically significant, a numerically higher proportion of the LFD group reported adequate relief and met the responder endpoint for IBS-SSS (50-point reduction) compared to the MD group (54.6% vs. 27.3% for IBS-AR and 81.8% vs. 45.5% for IBS-SSS, p = 0.39 and 0.18, respectively). The LFD group also had a significantly greater reduction in IBS-SSS score over the 4-week treatment period compared to the MD group (-105.5 vs. -60, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: MD provides symptom relief in IBS-D and IBS-M; however, the magnitude of relief was higher with the LFD. Larger diet comparison studies in real-world settings are needed before MD can be routinely recommended to IBS patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT05807919."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The Mediterranean diet pattern (MDP) is associated with health-associated gut microbes and metabolites. However, the impact of the MDP on the fecal metabolome in ulcerative colitis (UC) remains unclear. We characterized the fecal metabolome of patients with UC with high adherence to the MDP compared to the Canadian habitual diet (CHD). Furthermore, we explored potential differences in the fecal metabolome between dietary responders and nonresponders to the MDP. METHODS: Utilizing untargeted metabolomics on a subset of fecal samples obtained from a randomized controlled trial, adult patients with quiescent UC underwent a 12-week intervention following either the MDP (n = 8) or CHD (n = 8). Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was employed to profile endogenous fecal metabolites, while 16S amplicon sequencing was utilized to profile the fecal microbiota. RESULTS: A total of 701 human metabolites were detected, with 35 exhibiting significant differential expression between the MDP and CHD groups. Noteworthy, folate biosynthesis, sphingolipid biosynthesis, and steroid biosynthesis were identified as major pathways affected. Moreover, microbial analysis showed that individuals with increased levels of the class Bacteroidia (Bacteroides vulgatus [B. vulgatus], B. uniformis, and B. acidifaciens) in their stool at baseline were more likely to respond to the MDP. CONCLUSION: High adherence to an MDP is associated with beneficial metabolite changes associated with reducing inflammation in UC. In addition, fiber-degrading microbes abundant before dietary intervention played a role in the responsiveness to the MDP. This work lays the groundwork for developing a metabolic signature associated with the MDP to develop personalized nutrition strategies for UC prevention and treatment.

      "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing global health concern that is closely linked to metabolic syndrome, yet no approved pharmacological treatment exists. The Mediterranean diet (MD) emerged as a first-line dietary intervention for NAFLD, offering metabolic and hepatoprotective benefits. Now conceptualized as a complex chemical matrix rich in bioactive compounds, the MD exerts antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, improving insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism. Mitochondria play a central role in NAFLD pathophysiology, influencing energy metabolism, oxidative stress, and lipid homeostasis. Emerging evidence suggests that the MD's bioactive compounds enhance mitochondrial function by modulating oxidative phosphorylation, biogenesis, and mitophagy. However, most research has focused on individual compounds rather than the MD as a whole, leaving gaps in understanding its collective impact as a complex dietary pattern. This narrative review explores how the MD and its bioactive compounds influence mitochondrial health in NAFLD, highlighting key pathways such as mitochondrial substrate control, dynamics, and energy efficiency. A literature search was conducted to identify relevant studies on the MD, mitochondria, and NAFLD. While the search was promising, our understanding remains incomplete, particularly when current knowledge is limited by the lack of mechanistic and comprehensive studies on the MD's holistic impact. Future research integrating cutting-edge experimental approaches is needed to elucidate the intricate diet-mitochondria interactions. A deeper understanding of how the MD influences mitochondrial health in NAFLD is essential for developing precision-targeted nutritional strategies that can effectively prevent and manage the disease.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: The cultural and socioeconomic changes to which societies are exposed can alter individuals' lifestyles and dietary habits. The nutritional patterns of Mediterranean countries may also be affected by these factors at varying levels, depending on the changing social characteristics of the countries. This study aimed to determine Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) adherence among family members from four Mediterranean countries (Türkiye, Spain, Italy, and Lebanon). Methods: The survey was structured around sociodemographic data, family relationships, the Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS), the Mediterranean lifestyle index (MEDLIFE), the Mediterranean diet quality index (KIDMED), and the obstacles and drivers of MedDiet adherence. Results: The data were obtained from adults (n = 812), with the contribution of their children (n = 500) if they had any. According to the MEDAS, 22% of the adults strongly adhered to the MedDiet. Similar results were obtained when Mediterranean lifestyle adherence was analyzed using the MEDLIFE score, with 20% of the adults presenting a strong adherence, while significantly stronger adherence was found in Lebanon than in the other countries. Regarding the children and adolescents, around 30% presented strong adherence to the MedDiet. Price, availability, and accessibility were significant obstacles, whereas the perceptions of health and diet quality were identified as the drivers of the MedDiet. Conclusions: Overall, our results highlight the need for national policies to reduce the economic burden of healthy food options while encouraging equitable access to re-popularize the MedDiet pattern. Future research should focus on intervention strategies tailored to different age groups and socioeconomic backgrounds, the long-term impact of family-based strategies, and the cultural influences on MedDiet adherence.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: A healthy diet is essential for managing Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), yet optimal recommendations remain unclear, highlighting the need to explore alternative lifestyle interventions. The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) supports cardiometabolic health; however, challenges with adherence within this population are unknown. This study examines the acceptability and experiences of an ad libitum MedDiet in women with PCOS, offering recommendations for implementation. Methods: A 12-week MedDiet intervention was conducted with women aged 18-45 years, diagnosed with PCOS and a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 (n = 12). Adherence was assessed using the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener. Surveys and semi-structured interviews, guided by the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) model, explored participants' experiences. Thematic analysis identified barriers and facilitators, which were mapped to the COM-B and Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), with all findings subsequently aligned with the Behaviour Change Wheel to inform implementation strategies. Results: MedDiet adherence significantly improved from baseline to week 12 (Baseline: 4.1 ± 1.8; week 12: 8.3 ± 2.3; p = 0.001), alongside increases in knowledge (p = 0.004), cooking confidence (p = 0.01), and time management (p = 0.01). Adherence factors were mapped to 12 of the 14 TDF domains. Key facilitators included health benefits, reduced weight pressure, educational resources, and simple guidelines. Barriers involved organisation, food availability, and external influences. Effective implementation should integrate MedDiet education, behaviour change support, practical resources, and professional training for nutrition professionals and healthcare providers to support referrals and weight-neutral dietary management. Conclusions: A short-term ad libitum MedDiet is acceptable for women with PCOS. Strategies for patients and healthcare providers, aligned with the intervention functions of education, training, and enablement, are key to supporting adherence.",

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of a weight-loss lifestyle intervention on bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC), and low BMD prevalence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The 3-year, parallel-group Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea-Plus (PREDIMED-Plus) randomized clinical trial was conducted at recruiting centers in Spain from October 2013 to December 2016. Men and women (aged 55-75 years) with metabolic syndrome and overweight or obesity, as well as access to dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (from 4 centers in Navarra, Mallorca, Reus, and León), were included in this prespecified secondary analysis. The analysis was conducted from September 1 to October 30, 2024. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to the intervention or the control. The intervention group followed an energy-reduced Mediterranean diet and increased physical activity, whereas the control group was advised to follow an ad libitum Mediterranean diet with no physical activity promotion. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: BMD (total femur, lumbar spine [L1-L4], and femoral trochanter) and total BMC were measured using DXA at baseline and at 1 and 3 years of follow-up. T scores from BMD variables were determined, and osteopenia or osteoporosis status was defined as low BMD. Linear and logistic 2-level mixed models were used for main analyses including participants lost to follow-up. Intention-to-treat analysis, completers case analysis, and sensitivity analysis were additionally performed. RESULTS: This study included 924 older adults (mean [SD] age, 65.1 [5.0] years; 454 women [49.1%] and 470 men [50.9%]). Significant differences in mean changes between groups were observed, with an overall 3-year intervention increase in the intervention group (n = 460) compared with the control group (n = 464) in lumbar spine (L1-L4) BMD (between-group differences, -0.1 [95% CI, -0.8 to 0.8] g/cm2 after 1 year and 0.9 [95% CI, 0.1-1.8] g/cm2 after 3 years; overall P = .05). This protective association was observed for women (between-group differences, -0.1 [95% CI, -1.3 to 1.1] g/cm2 after 1 year and 1.8 [95% CI, 0.6-2.9] g/cm2 after 3 years; overall P = .005) but not for men. No overall 3-year intervention effect on total BMC and low BMD prevalence was observed. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the PREDIMED-Plus trial, an energy-reduced Mediterranean diet and physical activity lifestyle intervention mitigated weight loss- and age-related BMD decline among older women with metabolic syndrome compared with conventional ad libitum Mediterranean diet recommendations. Weight-loss lifestyle interventions with longer follow-up are warranted in the future to confirm these results in relation to bone health.

      "abstract": "Effective interventions targeting modifiable cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, such as diet, are urgently needed. The Cardiovascular Risk Prevention with a Mediterranean Dietary Pattern Reduced in Saturated Fat study hypothesizes that eliminating red and processed meat in the context of a Mediterranean diet (MD) will significantly modify circulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration and the fatty acid profile compared to general CVD prevention advice. Here we describe the intervention design and summarize baseline dietary intakes (mean ± standard deviation) related to MD adherence and red/processed meat intakes in a sample of 81 participants. The Cardiovascular Risk Prevention with a Mediterranean Dietary Pattern Reduced in Saturated Fat study is a two-arm, 8-week parallel randomized controlled intervention trial involving a final sample of 156 adults (≥18 years) with dyslipidemia (not undergoing pharmacological treatment) recruited from healthcare and community settings in Granada (Spain). The primary outcome will assess changes in circulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and the fatty acid profile, whilst secondary outcomes will measure changes in CVD-related metabolites/biomarkers, gut microbiome, diet/lifestyle, and intervention feasibility/acceptability. Preliminary findings indicate low MD adherence (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener score 7.6 ± 1.9), and high consumption of red and processed meat (1.04 ± 0.90) servings/d). These results underscore the need for targeted dietary interventions to address the growing burden of dyslipidemia and CVD. If successful, this intervention holds potential for scalability and significant impact on public health, dietary guidelines, and advancements in nutrition science by improving MD adherence and reducing CVD risk factors in adults with dyslipidemia.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders of childhood, causing cognitive and social dysfunctions. Symptoms may persist into adolescence and adulthood or may occur later in life without childhood onset. Nutrition, which is an environmental risk factor, is also important in the treatment of ADHD. The Mediterranean diet (MD) is a dietary model in accordance with the nutritional recommendations indicated in ADHD. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between ADHD and dietary alignment with the MD. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted with 440 students aged 18 to 24 years studying at Tekirdağ Namık Kemal University, Türkiye. The data collection tools used in the study were a sociodemographic characteristics form, an MD Quality Index (KIDMED), and the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS). RESULTS: The mean scores for the Attention Deficit subscale, Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscale, and total ASRS total score of the participants with low dietary alignment with the MD were significantly higher than those of the participants with moderate and high dietary alignment with the MD (p < 0.001). The KIDMED scores showed a strong negative correlation with the total ASRS scores (r = -0.681; p < 0.001) and the Attention Deficit subscale scores (r = -0.643; p < 0.001) and a moderate negative correlation with the Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscale scores (r = -0.533; p < 0.001). According to the results of the multivariate linear regression analysis, a one-unit increase in the KIDMED score is associated with a decrease of 2.333 units in the ASRS score (β = -2.333, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Greater dietary alignment with the MD was associated with a lower risk of ADHD symptoms, including attention deficit and hyperactivity/impulsivity, and the positive relationship between the ASRS subscales suggests that these symptoms often co-occur. Though the findings suggest that the MD may help reduce ADHD risk, the cross-sectional design precludes causal inference."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cancer-related fatigue is a common and distressing symptom experienced by cancer patients, which may persist from the time of diagnosis to the end of life. This fatigue negatively affects patients' physical, emotional, and cognitive well-being. Nutrition plays a key role in managing cancer-related fatigue, and recently, the Mediterranean diet has gained attention as a potential intervention. The present study uses data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to investigate the association between cancer-related fatigue and the Mediterranean diet. METHODS: Data from the NHANES 2017-2020.03 cycle were selected for this cross-sectional study. The Alternative Mediterranean Diet Adherence (AMED) score was used to evaluate the participants' adherence to the Mediterranean diet. AMED scores were calculated based on data from 24-h dietary recall interviews conducted on both day one and day two. Multiple linear regression modeling was used to explore the association between AMED scores and cancer-related fatigue, as well as the relationship between AMED scores and fatigue in the general population. RESULTS: A total of 6,413 adults aged 20 years and older were included in the study, with 707 identified as cancer patients. There was a noteworthy inverse relationship found between AMED scores and fatigue, which was more pronounced in cancer patients: β = -0.121, 95% CI: -0.172, -0.071 (p < 0.001) in the unadjusted model. This correlation remained significant after adjusting for all variables in model 3: β = -0.074, 95% CI: -0.127, -0.021 (p = 0.007). A significant dose-dependent relationship was found when AMED scores were expressed in quartiles, with a more pronounced negative association as AMED increased across all models (p for trend <0.05). In the cancer population, the analysis of individual nutrients and fatigue revealed that alcohol was significantly negatively associated with cancer-related fatigue in all models, particularly in the unadjusted model: β = -0.710, 95% CI: -1.058, -0.362 (p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses indicated that diabetes, education level and type of cancer had a significant effect on the relationship between AMED and fatigue, with interaction p-values of 0.010, 0.023 and 0.049, respectively. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet may contribute to reduce fatigue, especially in cancer patients; however, further research is necessary to validate this correlation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetic microvascular complications, including diabetic retinopathy (DR), diabetic nephropathy (DN), and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), contribute significantly to morbidity and healthcare burdens among individuals with diabetes. The Mediterranean diet (MD) has been associated with improved metabolic health, but its role in mitigating microvascular complications remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the impact of MD adherence on the risk and progression of these complications. METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus was conducted through February 12, 2025 to identify studies evaluating MD adherence and diabetic microvascular complications. Meta-analysis was performed where possible, with effect sizes reported as odds ratios (ORs) or hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Fourteen studies, encompassing 138 to 71,392 participants, were included. Meta-analysis indicated a significant reduction in DR risk among individuals adhering to the MD (HR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.49-0.97, p = 0.03; OR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.12-0.82, p = 0.02). A lower likelihood of DN development was observed (HR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.73-0.99, p = 0.04; OR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.25-0.96, p = 0.04). However, results for diabetic neuropathy were inconclusive due to study heterogeneity. Sensitivity analyses revealed notable heterogeneity and publication bias was detected in some analyses. CONCLUSION: Adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with a reduced risk of diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy, supporting its potential as a dietary intervention for diabetes management. However, the evidence for neuropathy remains inconclusive. Future well-controlled randomized trials are needed to strengthen causal inferences and refine clinical recommendations for MD-based interventions in diabetic microvascular complications."

METHODS: Participants that were 60 years of age at the Swedish VIPVIZA (VisualiZation of asymptomatic Atherosclerotic disease) trial baseline (2013-2016) with retrospective VIP (Västerbotten Intervention Programme) dietary data at ages 40, 50, and 60 (n=1034) were included. Dietary patterns were assessed using the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and Healthy Diet Score (HDS), while carotid ultrasound was used to measure carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) and carotid plaque (CP). Multivariable regressions and mediation analysis investigated associations, sex differences and potential mediating factors. RESULTS: High (OR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.52-0.98) or midrange (OR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.55-0.99) cumulative MDS for ages 40, 50 and 60, as compared to low, was associated with lower CP presence at age 60. Initial sex-stratified analysis yielded similar, though non-significant, point estimates. Further analysis revealed that the relationship between plaque and MDS seem driven more by women (0.41, 95% CI: 0.237-0.703) while a significant association between CIMT and MDS was only present in men (p < 0.05). HDS during midlife did not show any significant associations with CP or CIMT at age 60. CONCLUSION: Findings underscore associations of midlife Mediterranean-style diet and lower presence of subclinical carotid atherosclerosis at age 60 and confirm the significance of dietary interventions as potential means for cardiovascular disease prevention. The study enhances understanding of long-term dietary patterns and their link to subclinical atherosclerosis, supporting future interventions and further research."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: currently there are changes in lifestyle that have been modifying the nutritional culture, moving away from the Mediterranean diet (DMed) and acquiring a more sedentary lifestyle, a fact that has contributed to a significant increase in risk factors. (CVRF) such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), and consequently to a global increase in metabolic syndrome (MS) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which in the 21st century reinforces being the first cause of morbidity and mortality To reduce this pandemic, a multidisciplinary approach is required focused on the application of primary and secondary prevention strategies for modifiable CVRFs, focused on nutritional promotion and education through the promotion of a healthier lifestyle and diet from childhood, as the one that encompasses the MedD. This dietary pattern, together with physical exercise, has been shown to contribute to the primary and secondary prevention of DM2 and coexisting CVRF. OBJECTIVE: to determine the initial adherence to the DMed in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and to analyze the effects of a nutritional educational intervention from Primary Care on glycemic control and the degree of adherence to the Mediterranean diet post-intervention and their relationship. MATERIAL AND METHODS: descriptive observational study and quasi-experimental analytical study (before-after) in 93 patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus with poor glycemic control (A1c ≥ 7 %), carried out in various health centers in Albacete and Cuenca between 2018 and 2019, in which the relationship between adherence to MedDM and CVRF is evaluated, before and after an educational intervention on MedDM. They are administered a data collection sheet that includes a MedD adherence survey (MEDAS-14) at baseline and at 6 months, after completing an education on MedD in Primary Care (PC) medical and nursing consultations). The pre- and post-intervention variables were analyzed: age groups, sex, years of evolution of DM2, body mass index (BMI), as well as basal glycemia (GB) and glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c). The main variable \"MEDAS-14\" is related to the rest of the variables. RESULTS: both poor glycemic control and having a high BMI are related to low adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Pre-intervention the score of the survey of adherence to the Mediterranean diet was relatively low (7.44 ± 0.22 points), being in women (7.66 points) than in men (7.1 points). Despite the high consumption of olive oil, a large number of processed products are consumed (sweetened beverages, butter, commercial confectionery), with a low consumption of fruit, fish and nuts. The high levels of basal glycemia are also related to the low adherence to the Mediterranean diet (p < 0.04), as well as the increase in glycosylated hemoglobin (p < 0.06). Post-intervention, adherence to the DMED increased by 1.09 ± 2.56 points (8.55 points). Men being those who present 0.4 points more (8.7 points) than women (8.4 points). The biggest changes have been in relation to the increase in the consumption of white meat, olive oil, nuts, vegetables and stir-fry, and a decrease in the consumption of processed foods. CONCLUSIONS: in diabetic patients with poor control, a nutritional educational intervention that promotes MedDM from PC improves adherence to said diet, increasing the consumption of healthy foods and decreasing harmful ones, thus optimizing metabolic control.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The TCF7L2 gene is a significant genetic factor contributing to the risk of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). We previously found that subjects with the TT genotype of TCF7L2 rs7903146 variant, who consume a low-fat diet (LF) had a higher incidence of stroke than subjects with the CC genotype. Yet this association was abolished in subjects with the TT genotype who consumed a Mediterranean-type diet (MetD). However, the mechanism by which MetD diet modulates the association between TCF7L2 and CVD risk is unclear. This study aims to validate these findings under real-world conditions and clinical practice to elucidate the biological mechanisms involved in this correlation. METHODS: Thirty-five participants with BMI ranging from 27 to 34 kg/m2 were recruited based on rs7903146 genotype. Of those consented to participate, 21 had the CC and 14 had the TT genotype. Participants were randomly assigned to two dietary intervention groups, ensuring an equal distribution of CC and TT carriers. Each participant followed one of two diets (LF or MetD) for one week, followed by a 10-day washout period before switching to the other diet for one week. Blood samples were collected before and after each diet for metabolomic analysis using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The differential effect of the diets on triglyceride-rich lipoproteins was determined based on TCF7L2 genotype. RESULTS: The MetD significantly reduced triglyceride-rich lipoprotein concentrations compared to the LF diet. After consuming the LF diet, TT carriers exhibited more small VLDL particles, potentially contributing to CVD risk compared to CC carriers. However, this difference in risk was not observed with the MetD. Furthermore, the order in which the two diets were crossed affected the triglyceride-rich lipoprotein profile, with LF-MetD regimen showing a stronger effect on triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) levels than the MetD-LF regimen. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that rs7903146 TT carriers benefit more from a MetD than a LF diet in terms of their triglyceride-rich lipoprotein profile, which may reduce their risk of CVD. These results support the notion that genotype is a factor in determining the extent to which the MetD affects cardiovascular health."

We emphasize the importance of an integrated approach, with dietary interventions as a key component of holistic patient care. RECENT FINDINGS: Psoriasis, acne, and hidradenitis suppurativa are immune-mediated chronic diseases marked by systemic inflammation, with genetic and environmental factors influencing their onset. The Mediterranean diet, rich in plant-based foods with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties-such as whole-grain cereals, extra-virgin olive oil, vegetables, legumes, fruits, and nuts-has been shown to reduce the clinical severity of these conditions. It also supports weight control and positively impacts metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors, which are closely linked to these diseases. Dietary education, particularly about the Mediterranean diet, plays a crucial role in the management of these skin diseases and serves as an important non-pharmacological treatment option that can influence patient prognosis. This review offers specific nutrition recommendations for prescribing the Mediterranean diet to patients with chronic inflammatory skin diseases.",

An increased shift toward a \"Western\" dietary pattern was observed. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to gain insight into the various factors that may enhance or reduce adherence to the MD in patients with T2DM residing in Mediterranean countries. METHOD: We retrieved published studies from 2000 to 2023 from PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, Medline, and PsycINFO databases. The criteria for inclusion included individuals residing in Mediterranean countries aged 18+ with T2DM who underwent assessment using a validated MD scoring tool. We included 17 studies, with participant numbers ranging from 106 to 7,447. RESULTS: Compliance with the MD was moderate, with the most significant determinants of adherence being age, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), marital status, and educational level. However, limited information is available on psychological and economic determinants. CONCLUSION: Various factors, especially sociodemographic ones, influence adherence to the MD among patients with T2DM.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: With the increasing life expectancy and, as a result, the aging of the global population, there has been a rise in the prevalence of chronic conditions, which can significantly impact individuals' health-related quality of life, a multidimensional concept that comprises an individual's physical, mental, and social wellbeing. While a balanced, nutrient-dense diet, such as Mediterranean diet, is widely recognized for its role in chronic disease prevention, particularly in reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases and certain cancers, its potential benefits extend beyond these well-known effects, showing promise in improving physical and mental wellbeing, and promoting health-related quality of life. METHODS: A systematic search of the scientific literature in electronic databases (Pubmed/Medline) was performed to identify potentially eligible studies reporting on the relation between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and health-related quality of life, published up to December 2024. RESULTS: A total of 28 studies were included in this systematic review, comprising 13 studies conducted among the general population and 15 studies involving various types of patients. Overall, most studies showed a significant association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and HRQoL, with the most significant results retrieved for physical domains of quality of life, suggesting that diet seems to play a relevant role in both the general population and people affected by chronic conditions with an inflammatory basis. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to the Mediterranean diet provides significant benefits in preventing and managing various chronic diseases commonly associated with aging populations. Furthermore, it enhances the overall health and quality of life of aging individuals, ultimately supporting more effective and less invasive treatment approaches for chronic diseases.",

      "abstract": "Emerging evidence underscores the pivotal role of diet in preventing and managing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). As our comprehension of the microbiome's role in IBD expands, dietary modifications are increasingly recognized as potential adjuncts or primary therapeutic strategies. Key components of the Mediterranean diet (MD)-including microbiota-accessible carbohydrates, omega-3 fatty acids, polyphenols, and antioxidants-have demonstrated promise in enhancing gut microbiota diversity and reducing intestinal inflammation, making it a practical approach for managing IBD. Moreover, the MD offers additional benefits considering the rising prevalence of comorbid chronic inflammatory conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity in IBD patients. The purpose of this narrative review was to provide an overview of the feasibility and clinical outcomes of the MD and offer evidence-based guidance for researchers and practitioners on how to adapt the MD to patients with IBD. According to several cross-sectional and interventional studies, the MD is feasible for patients with IBD and confers several benefits, such as reduced inflammation, improved disease activity, and enhanced quality of life, with a strong adherence rate and minimal adverse effects. To facilitate knowledge translation, we provide a practical framework for integrating the MD as a nutritional therapy for IBD, including specific recommendations and messaging that researchers, practitioners, and patients can use. By synthesizing current evidence and offering actionable insights, the aim is to facilitate the integration of the MD into IBD management, with the potential to improve patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The impact of a healthy diet on the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke (IS) remains uncertain. Levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are inversely associated with the risk of IS recurrence. A Mediterranean diet (MeDi), consisting of a preference for fish/poultry, monosaturated fats from olive oil, fruit, vegetables, whole grains, legumes/nuts and limited red meats, animal fats and sweetened beverages, reduces metabolic syndrome, LDL-C levels and stroke risk. Avocados also reduce metabolic syndrome and LDL-C levels but are not part of the traditional MeDi diet. The effects of an avocado-based Mediterranean diet on LDL-C were investigated and compared to those of a low-fat diet in patients with previous IS. METHODS: The Avocado-Based Mediterranean Diet on Serum Lipids for Secondary Prevention after Ischemic Stroke (ADD-SPISE) was a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded outcome assessment, phase 2, clinical trial. The participants were adults with an IS in the previous month who were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to a MeDi or a low-fat diet for three months. Outcome assessors of laboratory results and data analysts were masked. The primary outcome was the mean difference in LDL-C between groups at 90 days, adjusted by statin use. Safety, feasibility and acceptability (assessed through a 14-item questionnaire administered to all patients who completed the follow-up) were also evaluated. RESULTS: From August 2018 to October 2022, 200 participants were enrolled (97 randomized to the low-fat diet and 103 to the MeDi), with 189 (94.5%) completing the study. There were no significant differences in LDL-C levels between the MeDi group and the low-fat group at 90 days: 66.5 mg/dL (95% confidence interval [CI] 59.6, 73.4) in the MeDi group and 69.9 mg/dL (62.6, 77.2) in the low-fat group at the end of follow-up. The adjusted difference was - 3.4 mg/dL (-13.4, -6.62); P = 0.50. The intervention group showed significant improvements in Mediterranean diet adherence (P < 0.01). Moreover, no significant differences in adverse events were observed between the groups. CONCLUSION: Compared with a low-fat diet, the avocado-based MeDi did not significantly lower LDL-C in IS patients after three months. The intervention was safe, feasible, and well accepted. Larger trials should establish whether longer dietary interventions could yield clinically significant benefits in these patients. The study is registered under ADD-SPISE at www.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is an inflammatory disease primarily treated through molecular-targeted therapies. However, emerging evidence suggests that dietary interventions may also play a role in managing inflammation associated with this condition. The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), prevalent in southern European countries, has been widely recognized for its ability to reduce cardiovascular mortality, largely due to its anti-inflammatory properties. This anti-inflammatory potential has prompted interest in exploring the MedDiet's role in immune-mediated diseases, including psoriasis. Observational studies have indicated potential benefits, such as reductions in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index. However, there is a need for well-designed clinical trials to address the methodological limitations of these studies and to establish specific dietary recommendations for psoriasis. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the impact of an intensive dietary intervention based on the MedDiet in patients with psoriasis. The study will assess the effects of this intervention on skin involvement, metabolic parameters, and inflammatory cytokines. In addition, the emotional well-being and quality of life of participants will be evaluated using validated questionnaires. A methodological analysis will also be conducted to enhance the design of future large-scale clinical trials. METHODS: An open-label, single-blinded (evaluator) randomized controlled trial was designed to assess the impact of a high-intensity MedDiet intervention in patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis. A total of 38 patients will be randomly assigned into 2 groups-an intervention group receiving the MedDiet intervention and a control group receiving standard care. The intervention group will participate in dietary education sessions aimed at adopting the MedDiet over 4 months, with monthly monitoring by experienced nutritionists. Participants will receive 500 mL of extra virgin olive oil per week, along with informative materials, recipes, and weekly menus. In contrast, the control group will receive standard low-fat diet recommendations without nutritionist monitoring. All participants will undergo a baseline visit, a 2-month follow-up visit, and a final visit at 4 months. Blood tests will be conducted at the beginning and end of the study. This study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Hospital Ramón y Cajal (Madrid) in July 2023. RESULTS: Enrollment concluded in October 2024, with data collection set to finish by February 2025. The findings will be presented at national and international conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals. CONCLUSIONS: This protocol outlines the design of a clinical trial that implements the MedDiet in patients with psoriasis to evaluate its benefits on skin involvement, systemic inflammation, and quality of life.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Previous studies identified genetic links between the TCF7L2 C/T variant rs7903146, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and obesity. We wished to deepen our understanding of how specific diets interact with this variant to affect blood metabolites, an aspect not previously investigated. Hence, we conducted a controlled study where individuals with different genotypes followed a Mediterranean (Med) or low-fat (LF) diet for 1 week. METHODS: Participants were recruited from the Boston, MA (USA) area. Anthropometric and clinical measures were taken. Genotypes at rs7903146 were ascertained, with homozygous carriers of the more common and protective CC or risk TT genotype invited to participate. Participants followed both diets (LF or Med) for 1 week with ∼10 days' washout between diets. Blood samples taken at the beginning and end of each diet period underwent metabolomics analysis using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We evaluated how the diet affected different metabolites based on genetic profile. RESULTS: The cohort of 35 persons was 43% female, aged 18-70 y, with BMI between 26.4 and 33.9 kg/m2. Focusing on fatty acids (FAs) and other lipid metabolic factors (n = 23), we observed a greater number and stronger correlations among these factors in the CC genotype-Med diet group than in the other three genotype-diet combinations. An aggregate of 11 factors, each negatively correlating with delta-saturated fatty acids (SFA), showed a significant genotype-Med diet interaction on delta-SFA in CC individuals on the Med diet (p = 0.0046). A similar genotype-Med diet interaction was observed for delta-monounsaturated fatty acids (p = 0.0078). These interactions were not statistically significant at the end of the LF intervention. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the Med diet has a stronger influence on regulating lipid factors in individuals with the CC genotype at the TCF7L2 variant rs7903146. This diet-genotype interaction may have significant implications for understanding the inter-individual variation of metabolic response on specific dietary regimens.",

Silybum marianum (SM) and alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) have shown antioxidant and adjuvant effects on the control of metabolic disorders. AIM: To evaluate whether the SM-ALA formulation (LUDLEV®), in combination with the Mediterranean diet (MD), could improve MASLD-related liver injury. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind clinical trial was conducted on patients with MASLD. Administration of SM-ALA plus MD (group A) vs placebo plus MD (group B) was compared for 24 weeks. At baseline and weeks 12 and 24, anthropometric measurements, metabolic parameters, and liver function were analyzed. Clinical effectiveness was evaluated through transient elastography. RESULTS: Fifty patients aged 54 ± 10 years were included, and the majority (74%) were female. Reduced visceral fat and umbilical circumference were reported in both groups, with significance in group A (P = 0.045 and 0.003, respectively). The decrease in controlled attenuation parameter was gradual and maintained at 12 and 24 weeks in group A (P = 0.026), whereas in group B the decrease was greater at week 12 and remained unchanged at week 24 (∆controlled attenuation parameter: -27 dB/m). Mild adverse effects were reported in 4 patients in group A (16%) and 4 patients in group B (16%), with no significant differences between groups (P = 0.641). CONCLUSION: SM-ALA (LUDLEV®) combined with the MD can promote the improvement of metabolic parameters, reducing visceral fat and hepatic steatosis in Mexican patients with MASLD."

Muscle health is crucial for the functionality and independence of older adults. As the aging population continuously grows, finding cost-effective strategies for preventing and treating sarcopenia is an important public health priority. While nutrition is recognized as a key factor in the development of sarcopenia, its role in preventing and treating the condition is still under investigation. In recent decades, nutritional research has shifted from a focus on individual nutrients or healthy foods to examining the combination of nutrients and foods in dietary patterns, along with their potential synergistic and antagonistic effects. A balanced diet and regular participation in physical activity are essential for maintaining musculoskeletal health. One of the healthy eating patterns with the greatest evidence of multiple health benefits is the Mediterranean diet, which has also been linked to positive effects on muscle function in observational studies. However, there is a lack of intervention studies. This review explores the updated evidence from longitudinal prospective studies on associations between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and sarcopenia in order to promote preventive and intervention strategies for healthy muscle aging.",

Treatment with diet and exercise has been suggested as possible non-pharmacological adjuvant treatment. OBJECTIVE: To determine changes in BC and PIC in patients with MS after a Mediterranean-type diet (MedDiet) and/or isokinetic exercise (IE). METHODS: A controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted at a third-level hospital in Mexico City. Intervention groups: G1: MedDiet + IE; G2: IE; G3: MedDiet; G4: control. Anthropometry, BC, and PIC were collected from the baseline and at 12 weeks post-intervention. MedDiet was estimated from a 24-h recall record. IE consisted of a standard high-intensity anaerobic exercise program. RESULTS: Forty-two patients with MS aged 18-65 years old were included. The most frequent comorbidities were obesity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. After 6 months of intervention, a significant reduction of resistin was observed within the IE group and MedDiet + IE, whereas the former group also showed an increase in adiponectin. Interventions of MedDiet and MedDiet + IE showed a decrease in IL-10. Regarding BC, all groups increased the resistance values in relation to the baseline but were lower than the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that MedDiet and IE have a selective impact on pro-inflammatory mediators, while the combination of MedDiet and IE may induce only minor changes in BC.",

      "abstract": "Background: Childhood nutrition plays an important role in the promotion of long-term health. Introducing solid foods in alignment with the Mediterranean Diet during weaning fosters a preference for healthy foods early in life. However, access to nutritious diets remains a challenge in underserved communities. Scampia, a socioeconomically disadvantaged district in Naples, Italy, exemplifies a community where barriers to healthy eating persist. This research reports a trial protocol that plans for a study to evaluate the impact of the Mediterranean Diet on child health and to establish preventive strategies for chronic diseases. Methods: The PEMED (PrEventive effect of MEditerranean Diet in Children) trial is a Bayesian Sequential Pragmatic Cluster Randomized Clinical Trial. Family Pediatricians (FPs) are randomized to deliver either Mediterranean Diet-based dietary guidance starting at weaning or standard dietary practices using typical baby foods. Children will be followed up for six years, with regular assessments of growth, microbiome composition, and adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, using validated tools. Interim analyses will be conducted at three-year intervals to evaluate the efficacy and monitor adverse events. Saliva and stool samples will be collected for genetic and microbiome analyses, and adherence will be monitored through quarterly dietary recalls and biomarkers. Results: This trial will consider Italy's established FP network for implementing innovative dietary intervention in a real-world setting. Conclusions: This study will address nutritional disparities in the underserved Scampia community and provide a scalable model for early dietary interventions. The results will shed light on the role of the Mediterranean Diet in improving childhood health and informing public health strategies globally."

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the SYNCHRONIZE + lifestyle multidisciplinary intervention in improving adherence to the Mediterranean diet, nutrition quality and dietary intake pattern in persons with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. METHODS: A pragmatic randomized clinical trial was conducted in primary care. Data were collected using the 17-item energy-restricted Mediterranean Adherence Screener (er-MEDAS), the food frequency questionnaire (sFFQ) and the 24 h recall questionnaire (24 HR), in addition to chrono-nutritional, anthropometric, and body composition data, at baseline and 3-, 6-, and 12- month follow-up visits, and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 158 participants were evaluated. Results showed the effectiveness of the intervention in improving adherence to the Mediterranean diet. The adherence depended on the group-time interaction being positive and significant at 3 and 6 months post-intervention in the INT group and on the participant age and educational level. Specifically, the intake of legumes, fruits, vegetables, nuts and blue fish was increased, while the intake of sweets and pastries, butter and cream and red and processed meat was reduced. Furthermore, the intake of chips and candies was also reduced, and the consumption of fermented food (yogurts, cheese, kefir) increased. Thus, general diet quality improved. Interestingly, the intake of key nutrients such as protein and iron increased. Furthermore, the number of night eaters was decreased significantly. Muscle mass index was also improved in the intervention group. These results were maintained in the medium to long term. CONCLUSION: SYNCHRONIZE + is a brief, low-cost, multidisciplinary intervention effective in improving adherence to the Mediterranean diet and improving nutritional and dietary intake patterns in persons with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. Further evaluation of the effect on quality of life and symptoms is needed.",

      "abstract": "Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and dietary patterns have emerged as a significant modifiable factor in stroke prevention. The Mediterranean diet, characterized by high intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, olive oil, and fish, has been widely recognized for its cardiovascular benefits. However, its specific impact on stroke risk requires further elucidation. We conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of 30 studies, including both cohort and case-control designs, to evaluate the relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the risk of stroke. A systematic search was performed across multiple databases, and a random-effects model was used to estimate pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic, and publication bias was examined through funnel plots and Egger's regression test. Additionally, trial sequential analysis was conducted to determine the adequacy of the sample size. The meta-analysis revealed a significant reduction in stroke risk among individuals adhering to the Mediterranean diet, with a pooled HR of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.84-0.91). Notably, a significant heterogeneity was detected (I2 = 34%). The Z-score plot from trial sequential analysis confirmed that the sample sizes were sufficient to draw definitive conclusions. However, a potential publication bias was identified. The case-control studies confirmed a highly significant effect (HR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.4-0.73). The funnel plots in both settings hinted at the presence of a potential publication bias, supported by a significant Egger's test. Our findings provide robust evidence supporting the protective effect of the Mediterranean diet against stroke. Despite the presence of some heterogeneity and potential publication bias, the cumulative evidence suggests that promoting the Mediterranean diet could serve as an effective public health strategy for stroke prevention. Further research is recommended to explore the underlying mechanisms and to assess the diet's impact across diverse populations."

      "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterised by chronic inflammation in joints. Obesity, stress, being women and dietary pattern are important in pathogenesis. The joint damage in RA is accelerated by oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to examine the serum total antioxidant level, nutritional status and Mediterranean diet adherence of adult women with RA. Thirty-five adult women RA patients and thirty-five healthy control participated in this study (45·4 ± 11·61 and 42·5 ± 8·50 years, respectively). Nutritional status, physical activity levels and adherence to the Mediterranean diet were questioned. Physicians assessed the disease activity score of patients with RA. Serum total antioxidant and oxidant status were analysed. The serum total antioxidant status of the control group was higher, whereas the oxidative stress index and total oxidant status were lower than that of the RA group. Dietary protein, fibre, EPA, retinol, Fe, Zn and total antioxidant intake in the RA group were lower than in the control group (P < 0·05). Individuals with higher fibre intake showed a significantly lower risk for RA after adjusting for potential confounding factors (OR = 0·845, 95 % CI = 0·773-0·923, P < 0·001). The mean physical activity level of the control group was higher than that of the RA group (1·59 ± 0·10 and 1·53 ± 0·13, respectively) (P = 0·01). In conclusion, serum antioxidant parameters and dietary antioxidant intake are decreased in patients with RA. Therefore, medical treatment for these patients should be supplemented with medical nutrition therapy to achieve optimal nutritional status.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite an urgent need for multi-domain lifestyle interventions to reduce dementia risk, there is a lack of interventions which are informed by theory- and evidence-based behaviour change strategies, and no interventions in this domain have investigated the feasibility or effectiveness of behaviour change maintenance. We tested the feasibility, acceptability and cognitive effects of a personalised theory-based 24-week intervention to improve Mediterranean diet (MD) adherence alone, or in combination with physical activity (PA), in older-adults at risk of dementia, defined using a cardiovascular risk score. METHODS: Participants (n = 104, 74% female, 57-76 years) were randomised to three parallel intervention arms: (1) control, (2) MD, or (3) MD + PA for 24 weeks and invited to an optional 24-week follow-up period with no active intervention. Behaviour change was supported using personalised targets, a web-based intervention, group sessions and food provision. The primary outcome was behaviour change (MD adherence and PA levels), and the secondary outcomes included feasibility and acceptability, cognitive function, cardiometabolic health (BMI and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure) and process measures. RESULTS: The intervention was feasible and acceptable with the intended number of participants completing the study. Participant engagement with group sessions and food provision components was high. There was improved MD adherence in the two MD groups compared with control at 24 weeks (3.7 points on a 14-point scale (95% CI 2.9, 4.5) and 48 weeks (2.7 points (95% CI 1.6, 3.7)). The intervention did not significantly change objectively measured PA. Improvements in general cognition (0.22 (95% CI 0.05, 0.35), memory (0.31 (95% CI 0.10, 0.51) and select cardiovascular outcomes captured as underpinning physiological mechanisms were observed in the MD groups at 24 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention was successful in initiating and maintaining dietary behaviour change for up to 12 months which resulted in cognitive benefits. It provides a framework for future complex behaviour change interventions with a range of health and well-being endpoints. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03673722.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite its benefits, the Mediterranean diet (MD) is abandoned or not adopted by the younger generations in most Mediterranean countries. OBJECTIVE: The aim here was to examine some factors determining adherence to MD in Moroccan school-age adolescents. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in a school setting among 386 students (148 boys and 238 girls), aged 14 to 18 years, randomly selected and from different socioeconomic strata. A structured questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic, socioeconomic and lifestyle data. Physical activity was assessed using the short French version of the IPAQ questionnaire. The KIDMED test was used to assess adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Weight, height and waist circumference were measured according to WHO standards. Body mass index (BMI) and waist�to-height ratio (WHtR) were calculated. Statistical ANOVA test was used for to compare multiple means, Student's t-test for independent samples, Chi2 test for categorical variables and multinomial logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with adherence to the MD amongst adolescents sample. RESULTS: Adherence to the MD in this population was very low, with nearly 53% having poor adherence and only 7.7% reporting optimal adherence. Multinomial regression analyses showed that poor adherence is correlated with female gender (p=0.042), low paternal education (p=0.004), limited number of meals (p=0.006), advanced age (p=0.005) and inadequate sleep duration (p=0.027). In contrast, better adherence appears to be correlated with a high number of meals per day (p<0.001) and a better socio-professional class of the father (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a low prevalence of good adherence to MD confirming a transition of the study adolescents towards a Westernized diet. Targeted nutritional intervention programs should be implemented to improve adherence to the MD among Moroccan adolescents, by promoting healthy eating habits.",

      "abstract": "Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases. The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is an extensively studied dietary pattern which has been proposed as a lifestyle intervention to promote healthy aging in the general population, due to its numerous health benefits. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to explore the mechanism(s) by which the MedDiet exerts its beneficial effects on aging. One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called 'inflamm-aging', a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging. We identified 14 papers representing 12 unique RCTs. Based on our findings, we present 10 recommendations for the next clinical trial of the MedDiet in inflamm-aging."

This study aims to increase the knowledge regarding the genetic background of LBW by analyzing its association with a set of 110 maternal variants related to gestational diabetes mellitus, in the setting of a nutritional intervention with Mediterranean diet. The analysis follows a multifactorial approach, including maternal genetic information of 1,642 pregnant women, along with their anthropometric and metabolic characteristics. Binary logistic regression models provided 33 discovery variants associated with LBW that underwent a functional enrichment process to obtain a protein/gene interaction network and 126 enriched terms. Overall, our analysis proves that genetic variants form proximity clusters, grouped into subsets statistically associated with underlying biological processes or other maternal characteristics, which, on their part, allow early prevention of the eventual risk of LBW."

Notably, obesity is widely recognized as a significant risk factor for the development of breast cancer. The Mediterranean diet has been shown to improve health outcomes among overweight or obese breast cancer survivors. This narrative review aims to consolidate information on the existing research interventions elucidating the benefits of the Mediterranean diet for the overall health of breast cancer survivors. Methods: Using the search terms \"Mediterranean diet\" and \"breast cancer survivor\", a total of 44 articles were identified. This review focuses on the six articles meeting the inclusion criteria, examining impacts on various health outcomes such as weight loss, quality of life, and various metabolic parameters (e.g., triglycerides, BMI, fasting glucose). Results: Most of the intervention studies examined weight loss and metabolic parameters including BMI and fat mass. The research results indicate that the Mediterranean diet effectively reduces BMI, waist circumference, and fat mass. Moreover, the data suggest that this dietary approach may support attaining a healthier BMI in overweight or obese breast cancer survivors. The data from various studies show no statistically significant findings for high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, and total cholesterol levels. The assessment of quality of life varied across the studies, leading to challenges in reaching definitive conclusions. Conclusions: This narrative review offers a comprehensive overview of the impact of the Mediterranean diet on the health outcomes of breast cancer survivors who are overweight or obese.",

      "abstract": "In 2022, healthy sleep was included as part of Life's Essential 8, which are a cluster of fundamental factors for cardiovascular health. In many studies, sleep duration and/or quality have also been found to be related to human health. The purpose of this narrative review was to present the relationship between the Mediterranean diet, the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, and the MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet and sleep quality and duration in different populations. A literature search was conducted based on the phrases \"Mediterranean diet\", \"DASH diet\", and \"MIND diet\" appearing together with \"sleep\" or \"insomnia\" in papers' titles or abstracts. Studies on obstructive sleep apnea or shift work were excluded. The electronic databases were searched via EBSCOhost. Main results: The vast majority of studies showed that there was a beneficial association between the three diets discussed in this review and sleep duration and/or quality; however, most of these results were obtained in cross-sectional analyses. There were only a few studies in which an association between sleep parameters and these diets was not observed. Direction for future studies: Taking into account the significant role of adequate sleep quality in various diseases, even in all-cause mortality, the implementation of randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies seems to be necessary to provide further evidence that would allow these associations to be confirmed. In conclusion, the results obtained so far in various populations strongly suggest that healthy dietary patterns abundant in plant foods, are associated with better sleep quality, as well as with a more adequate length of sleep.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cognitive frailty is known to be associated with both nutrition and cognitive training. However, effective treatments that engage older adults with cognitive frailty in both the Mediterranean diet and cognitive training are lacking. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the feasibility and preliminary effects of Gamified Home-Based Cognitive-Nutritional (GAHOCON) on older adults with cognitive frailty, focusing on Mediterranean diet knowledge, adherence to the Mediterranean diet, cognitive function, physical frailty, grip strength, walking speed, memory, and body composition. METHODS: This study applied a 2-center, assessor-blinded, 2-parallel-group, noninferiority, randomized controlled trial design. Eligible participants were community-dwelling adults aged 60 years or older, living with cognitive frailty, and exhibiting poor adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group in a 1:1 ratio. In the intervention group, participants received 4 weeks of center-based training (health education) followed by 8 weeks of home-based training (GAHOCON). In the control group, participants received only the 4 weeks of center-based training and 8 weeks of self-revision of health educational materials at home. During the intervention period, time spent by the participants and the levels of difficulty completed by them weekly on GAHOCON were measured as markers of feasibility. The outcomes included Mediterranean diet knowledge, adherence to the Mediterranean diet, cognitive function, physical frailty, grip strength, walking speed, memory, and body composition. Data were collected at baseline (T0) and 1 week postintervention (T1). The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to examine within-group effects for the outcome variables in each group separately. RESULTS: A total of 25 participants were recruited, with 13 allocated to the intervention group and 12 to the control group. The median cumulative minutes spent on GAHOCON training increased from 117 to 926 minutes. The median level of difficulty completed for game 1 increased from level 14 to level 20, while for game 2, it increased from level 2 to level 24. After the completion of the interventions, Mediterranean diet knowledge was retained in the intervention group but significantly decreased in the control group (r=-0.606, P=.04). Significant improvements were observed in the intervention group in Mediterranean diet adherence (r=-0.728, P=.009), cognitive function (r=-0.752, P=.007), physical frailty (r=-0.668, P=.02), and walking speed (r=-0.587, P=.03), but no such improvements were seen in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: GAHOCON is feasible in engaging older adults with cognitive frailty to regularly participate in the intervention. Preliminary evidence suggests that it can retain Mediterranean diet knowledge following nutritional education, improve adherence to the Mediterranean diet, and enhance global cognitive function, physical frailty, and walking speed. However, the difficulty of the later levels of game 1 may be too high. Future studies should adjust the difficulty level of game 1. Additionally, trials with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are needed to confirm its effects.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several studies have supported the role of innate immune system as a key factor in the sterile inflammation underlying the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis in mice. However, its involvement in humans remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the association between neutrophil count, and the intima-media thickness of common carotid arteries (IMT-CC), as well as the potential impact of long-term dietary interventions on these associations. METHODS: A comprehensive analysis was conducted within the framework of the CORDIOPREV study, a long-term secondary prevention study involving dietary interventions with either a Mediterranean or a low-fat diet. The study evaluated the relationship between absolute neutrophil count and neutrophil-related ratios with IMT-CC at baseline and after 5 and 7 years of dietary intervention. RESULTS: At baseline, patients in the highest tertile of neutrophil count had a higher IMT-CC and number of carotid plaques, when compared to lowest tertile (P < .01 and P < .05, respectively). Logistic regression analyses supported this association. Elevated neutrophil count, neutrophil-to-erythrocyte ratio, and neutrophil-to-HDL ratio were associated with an increased likelihood of having an IMT-CC >.9 mm {odds ratio (OR) 1.17 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.35], OR 2.21 (95% CI 1.24-4.12), and OR 1.96 (95% CI 1.09-3.55), respectively}, after adjustment for all variables, which was corroborated by linear regression. Furthermore, a linear mixed-effect model analysis from a longitudinal analysis spanning 5 and 7 years revealed an increase in 1 unit of neutrophils/μl at these time points was associated with a mean increase of .004 (.002) mm in the IMT-CC (P = .031) after adjustment for all variables. Interestingly, in patients exhibiting regression in IMT-CC after 7 years of follow-up, those following a Mediterranean diet showed a significant decrease in neutrophil count after 5 and 7 years (both with P < .05), compared to baseline. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that neutrophils may represent a promising target for preventing atherosclerosis. A Mediterranean diet could serve as an effective dietary strategy to reduce neutrophil levels and potentially slow the progression of atherosclerosis, offering a new neutrophil-reducing therapy concept. Further research is essential to gain deeper insights into the role of neutrophils in the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in humans.",

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 1,442 participants were randomly assigned to one of four interventions: 1) MET (1,700 mg/day) plus MedDiet intervention (MET+MedDiet); 2) placebo plus MedDiet intervention; 3) MET (1,700 mg/day) alone; and 4) placebo alone. Participants were followed up for 3 years on average. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of major noncommunicable diseases (including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer). Secondary outcomes were the incidence of type 2 diabetes and the changing prevalence of metabolic syndrome. RESULTS: The crude incidence of the major noncommunicable diseases was 6.7 cases per 100 person-years in the MET+MedDiet group, 6.9 in the MET alone group, 13.3 in the placebo plus MedDiet group, and 11.3 in the placebo group. The differences were fully explained by the reduction of type 2 diabetes, which was 80% and 92% lower in the MET and MET+MedDiet groups, respectively, compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: The use of 1,700 mg/day MET is effective to prevent diabetes in people selected on the basis of metabolic syndrome.",

      "abstract": "The detrimental health and economic burdens associated with insomnia have led to investigations examining its prevalence and potential predictors to utilize this information in insomnia prevention/treatment. Ethnicity, gender, and lifestyle habits are among the important predictors associated with insomnia. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of insomnia and potential predictors of insomnia among Arab men living in Jordan, including Mediterranean diet (MD) adherence. The inclusion criteria of this cross-sectional, correlational study were: (1) being a male; (2) aged 18 and older; and (3) able to read, write, and speak the Arabic language. Online questionnaires were used to assess participants' sociodemographic information, adherence to the MD, physical activity, and insomnia. Results demonstrated that there was a high prevalence of insomnia (53.9%) among the study's participants (N = 529). Moreover, in the unadjusted model, the study revealed that being unemployed (OR = 1.90, p = 0.018), categorized as dehydrated (OR = 1.20, p = 0.020), overweight (OR = 1.30, p = 0.035), sleeping less than 6 hours/day (OR = 2.10, p < 0.001), and having high adherence to the MD (OR = 1.60, p = 0.010) were predictors of insomnia. Meanwhile, the adjusted multivariate logistic regression model indicated that being married (OR = 1.20, p = 0.020) played a significant protective role against developing insomnia among Arab men. While high adherence to MD (OR = 1.642, p = 0.028) and sleeping less than 6 hours/day (OR = 2.760, p < 0.001) were relative risk factors for experiencing insomnia. The high prevalence of insomnia in this population and the identification of possible predictors associated with insomnia, and the unexpected relationship between adherence to the MD and insomnia warrant further in-depth investigations that may help promote the understanding of the factors associated with insomnia and facilitate the development of interventions to target it.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its related co-morbidities, i.e., type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, have an enormous burden on population health and healthcare systems. Mediterranean diet can reduce this burden; quantifying this reduction via the calculation of the Prevented Fraction for the Population (PFP) could offer positive-framed messages to encourage adherence to this healthful dietary pattern. Hence, the aim of this study was to calculate PFP of CVD, T2DM, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia by long-term adherence to the Mediterranean type of diet, during a 20-year period, in a Mediterranean population. METHODS AND RESULTS: The sample consisted of adult participants, initially free-of-CVD, from the ATTICA prospective cohort study (2002-2022). At all evaluations (2002, 2006, 2012, 2022), CVD, T2DM, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia were assessed according to WHO-ICD-10, and Mediterranean diet adherence was assessed via MedDietScore. PFP by Mediterranean diet was computed for each outcome in different population groups. It was found that approximately 30 % of CVD, T2DM, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia cases were prevented due to the high long-term adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Concerning different population groups, it was observed that due to their decreased adherence and PFPs, male participants, older participants and participants with comorbidities might benefit more from following the Mediterranean diet during a long-term period. CONCLUSION: The study findings suggest that future public health strategies should aim to make the Mediterranean diet a long-term lifestyle change rather than a short-term diet intervention, while shedding light on which population groups should be targeted first.",

      "abstract": "The Mediterranean diet has gained significant attention for its potential health benefits on diverse pathological conditions including osteoarthritis (OA), a prevalent degenerative joint disease characterized by cartilage breakdown and inflammation. Numerous observational studies have suggested that adherence to the Mediterranean diet, may have protective effects against OA. The abundance of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds and omega-3 fatty acids, among the Mediterranean diet components is believed to contribute to its beneficial effects on OA. Research investigating the association between the Mediterranean diet and OA has shown promising results. Several observational studies have reported that adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with a reduced risk of developing OA and with lower severity of OA symptoms. Additionally, intervention studies have demonstrated improvements in pain, function, and quality of life among OA patients following a Mediterranean diet intervention. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests potential mechanisms underlying the protective effects of the Mediterranean diet against OA, including its ability to reduce inflammation, oxidative stress, and cartilage degradation. However, further well-designed randomized controlled trials and mechanistic studies are needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms and establish causality. In conclusion, the Mediterranean diet appears to be a promising dietary approach for the prevention and management of OA. Its rich array of nutrients and bioactive compounds may exert protective effects against OA development and progression, although more research is warranted to confirm these findings and elucidate underlying mechanisms.",

This paper aims to explore the current status and research hotspots on the connection between the Mediterranean diet and DM from 2014 to 2024, providing a reference for future studies. METHODS: We retrieved articles published between 2014 and 2024 from the Web of Science database and analyzed them using R software, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace. RESULTS: A total of 2,806 articles were included in this study. Research on the relationship between the MedDiet and DM showed a steady increase in publication volume from 2014 to 2019, followed by a sharp rise from 2020 to 2023. Spain was the leading country in terms of publication volume, followed by Italy, the United States, China, and Greece. Spain also led in international collaborations, with CIBER-Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red and Harvard University being the most prominent collaboration centers. Nutrients was the most frequently published and cited journal in this field. Common keywords in this literature included components such as olive oil, legumes, and red wine. Mechanisms studied in this field primarily focused on antioxidant effects, improvements in insulin sensitivity and secretion, regulation of lipid metabolism, and modulation of gut microbiota. CONCLUSION: Research on the beneficial effects of the MedDiet on DM patients has garnered significant attention from researchers worldwide, and it is expected to become a major focus for future DM prevention and treatment. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the current status and research hotspots regarding the relationship between the MedDiet and DM, offering valuable references for future research."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction is recognized as an early modification involved in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases. Evidence suggests that the Mediterranean Diet (MD) is associated with endothelial function improvement and, in turn, plays an important role in atherosclerosis development and progression. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate both acute and sustained effects of the MD on endothelial function in patients with high cardiometabolic risk. METHODS: A total of 25 subjects were randomly assigned to either the MD group or the Control Diet (CD) group according to a single-blind, parallel-group study design. Endothelial function was evaluated through non-invasive flow-mediated dilation (FMD) measurements at baseline (T0) and after 8 weeks (Tw8) of the MD or CD intervention, under both 12 h fast condition (fasting) and 2 h post-meal resembling the assigned diet (2 h). Assessments were conducted by a blinded sonographer. RESULTS: FMD at T0-fasting was similar between MD and CD groups (6.11% ± 0.67 vs. 7.90% ± 1.65; p = 0.266). A significant difference in FMD between MD and CD groups was observed at T0-2h (12.14% ± 1.93 vs. 4.01% ± 1.03; p = 0.004), T8w-fasting (9.76% ± 1.18 vs. 5.03% ± 0.89; p = 0.008), and T8w-2h (8.99% ± 1.22 vs. 3.86% ± 0.52; p = 0.003). Oral glucose insulin sensitivity (OGIS) at T0 correlated with FMD percent changes from T0-fasting to T0-2h (r = 0.414, p = 0.044). After adjusting for age, gender, and OGIS, MD was an independent predictor of percent changes in FMD from T0-fasting to T0-2h (β: -0.582, p = 0.003), from T0-fasting to T8w-fasting (β: -0.498, p = 0.013), and from T0-fasting to T8w-2h (β: -0.479, p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to the MD may improve endothelial function in both the short- and medium-term among patients at high cardiometabolic risk."

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder amongst reproductive-aged women associated with cardiometabolic, reproductive and psychological abnormalities. Lifestyle modification, including a healthy diet, is considered first-line treatment for management of clinical symptoms. However, there is limited high-quality evidence to support one superior therapeutic dietary intervention for PCOS management that is beyond general population-based dietary guidelines. Adherence to a Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) has been shown to decrease cardiometabolic disease risk and attenuate depressive symptoms, particularly in patients with metabolic perturbations. This narrative review summarises the proposed biological mechanisms underpinning the potential therapeutic benefits of a MedDiet for the management of cardiometabolic, reproductive and psychological features related to PCOS. Observational evidence suggests an inverse relationship between MedDiet adherence and PCOS features, particularly insulin resistance and hyperandrogenemia. Although the exact mechanisms are complex and multifaceted, they are likely related to the anti-inflammatory potential of the dietary pattern. These mechanisms are underpinned by anti-inflammatory bioactive constituents present in the MedDiet, including carotenoids, polyphenols and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Synthesis of the available literature suggests the MedDiet could be a promising therapeutic dietary intervention to attenuate short and long-term symptoms associated with PCOS and may aid in reducing the longer-term risks associated with cardiometabolic diseases and reproductive and psychological dysfunction. Nevertheless, current evidence remains insufficient to inform clinical practice and well-designed clinical trials are needed. As such, we provide recommendations for the design and delivery of future MedDiet interventions in women with PCOS, including exploring the acceptability, and feasibility to enhance adherence."

Nutritional practices become crucial for prevention, prompting healthcare professionals (HCP) to respond. The present study assessed a Culinary Medicine (CM) program's impact on HCP's Mediterranean diet adherence, food and diet therapy knowledge, food management skills, culinary proficiency, and counseling confidence. A mixed-methods pilot implementation program (PIP) engaged 20 HCP from Hospital Clinic Barcelona at the Alícia Foundation kitchen-lab. Four 8-hour CM sessions, held weekly, covered culinary knowledge emphasizing disease prevention and care. All twenty participants; 86% women, 14% men, 86% aged above 40, 14% between 31 and 39 years, 71% nurses, 7% medical doctors and 21% other occupation, completed the course and fourteen fulfilled pre-and post-program questionnaires. Notably, 86% had prior nutrition training, while only 14% had culinary training. After the program, there was significant improvement in Mediterranean diet adherence (P < .05). Perceptions on dietary advice usefulness, patient-transferable knowledge acquisition, cooking techniques, and personal cooking skills confidence showed post-course improvements. This study underscores the potential of hands-on CM training in HCP nutrition education, influencing their culinary knowledge. Future studies with larger samples is needed to elucidate CM training's impact on HCP and potential public health benefits."

      "abstract": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remains a major health issue, often developing silently as subclinical atherosclerotic disease (SAD). The Mediterranean diet (MDiet) is known for its cardiovascular benefits, but the combined influence of both MDiet adherence and physical activity (PA) on SAD progression has not been previously documented. Objective: We aimed to investigate how adherence to a healthy lifestyle, defined as MDiet adherence and PA level, influences SAD progression in subjects from the ILERVAS cohort follow-up. Methods: A study on 3097 participants from the ILERVAS prospective cohort was conducted. MDiet adherence was assessed using the MEDAS score, and PA categories were established using the IPAQ, both categorized into low, moderate, and high levels. Two different lifestyle scores integrating the MDiet and PA categories were built. The presence of atherosclerotic plaques was assessed by carotid and femoral ultrasound examination. Demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were also obtained. Multivariable linear, logistic, and Poisson regression models adjusted for potential confounders were used to analyze the association between the lifestyle scores and SAD progression, as well as the MDiet and PA as separate variables and number of territories with plaque. Results: A healthier lifestyle score did not show an effect on SAD progression. However, a higher MEDAS score was associated with a 3% decrease in the number of territories with plaque (IRR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96-0.99, p < 0.001), suggesting a protective effect of the adherence to the MDiet. PA did not show a significant association (IRR 1.00, 95% CI 1.00-1.00, p = 0.269). Older age, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, and lower eGFR were associated with SAD progression, while the female sex was protective (IRR 0.67, 95% CI 0.63-0.72, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The findings of this study show that higher adherence to the MDiet is associated with reduced incidence of SAD, indicating its potential role in cardiovascular prevention strategies. Although a higher lifestyle score or physical activity levels did not show any significant effect, promoting the MDiet, alongside managing traditional cardiovascular risk factors, could be an effective public health intervention to prevent atherosclerosis and reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease.",

      "abstract": "Glaucoma, a prevalent and potentially blinding eye disease, is linked to a variety of factors, including elevated intraocular pressure, optic nerve damage, and oxidative stress. In recent years, dietary habits, as a controllable lifestyle factor, have received increasing attention in the prevention and treatment of glaucoma. The purpose of this review was to investigate the effects of dietary factors on glaucoma, with a particular emphasis on two common dietary patterns: the high-salt diet and the Mediterranean diet. In addition, we investigated the association between many particular nutrients (including omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, caffeine, and minerals) and glaucoma to fully assess the potential involvement of dietary variables in glaucoma pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment. This article reveals the importance of dietary components in glaucoma prevention and explores prospective possibilities for future research by conducting a comprehensive review of previous scientific studies."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dietary factors and chronic gastrointestinal diseases are frequent determinants of sexual dysfunctions (SD). Whether inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are associated with SD is not well known as well as the role of diet and quality of life (QoL). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence of SD in a cohort of IBD patients and assess the role of clinical-demographic variables, adherence to Mediterranean diet (MD) and QoL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional observational study involving 301 patients (134 females and 167 males); 119 had Crohn's Disease and 182 had ulcerative colitis. SD were assessed through the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Adherence to MD was evaluated by the MD Score. QoL was investigated by the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) which yields summary scores of physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) health. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify predictors of SD. RESULTS: Prevalence of SD in females was 61.9%, while 52.1% of males had erectile dysfunction. No differences in the prevalence of SD were found between CD and UC in both males and females. IBD activity, as defined by patient-reported outcomes, was significantly associated with SD in both sexes. In females, MD adherence score (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.653-0.974, p = 0.027), PCS (OR = 0.936, CI 95% = 0.891-0.983, p = 0.008), and MCS (OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.906-0.985, p = 0.008) were protective against SD, whereas in males a higher PCS was associated with a lower probability of SD (OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.891-0.978, p = 0.004) DISCUSSION: IBD patients had a significant prevalence of SD which occurred more frequently in females than in males. Disease activity is associated with a higher likelihood of SD in both sexes, whereas dietary factors are differentially associated with SD in males and females. A better QoL is associated with a lower risk of SD. CONCLUSION: SD is prevalent among men and women with IBD. Adherence to MD, PCS and MCS in females as well as PCS in males were protective against SD. The assessment of sexual function in IBD patients could be relevant in order to reach an early diagnosis and a timely treatment."

However, evidence regarding their combined effects in older adults is scarce. This study aimed to investigate the impact of a combined 12-week Mediterranean diet-based sustainable healthy diet (SHD) and multicomponent training (MT) intervention on body composition, anthropometry, and physical fitness in older adults. METHODS: Diet intervention groups received a weekly SHD food supply and four sessions, including a SHD culinary practical workshop. The exercise program included MT 50 min group session, three times a week, on non-consecutive days. Body composition and physical fitness variables were assessed through dual X-ray absorptiometry, anthropometric measurements, and senior fitness tests. Repeated measures ANOVA, with terms for group, time, and interaction, was performed. RESULTS: Our results showed that a combined intervention significantly lowered BMI and total fat. Also, significant differences between assessments in all physical fitness tests, except for aerobic endurance, were observed. Adjusted models show significant differences in BMI (p = 0.049) and WHR (p = 0.037) between groups and in total fat (p = 0.030) for the interaction term. Body strength (p < 0.001), balance tests (p < 0.001), and aerobic endurance (p = 0.005) had significant differences amongst groups. Considering the interaction term, differences were observed for upper body strength (p = 0.046) and flexibility tests (p = 0.004 sit and reach, p = 0.048 back scratch). CONCLUSIONS: Our intervention study demonstrates the potential of implementing healthy lifestyle and sustainable models to promote healthy and active aging.",

This systematic review aims to evaluate the effects of the MD on athletic performance, strength, body composition, and metabolic markers in both athletes and non-professional athletes. Methods: The review included seven studies with a total of 116 participants, ranging from professional handball players to non-professional strength athletes. The studies assessed various aspects of athletic performance, including strength, power, endurance, and body composition. Results: The main key findings from the review showed that MD may improve muscle endurance and power, as well as anaerobic performance in CrossFit athletes, and MD was associated with enhanced strength performance, including increased vertical jump height, hand grip strength, and shuttle run performance. The results on the impact on body composition were mixed, with some studies showing improvements in fat-free mass and skeletal muscle mass, while others found no significant changes. The MD also demonstrated positive effects on several markers, such as increased plasma total antioxidant activity and decreased markers of oxidative stress and inflammation. Conclusions: In conclusion, while the MD seems to represent a viable dietary strategy for enhancing athletic performance and overall health, more rigorous studies are necessary to clarify its impact across diverse athletic populations.",

The present study evaluated the effect of the MD on gut microbial diversity and structure and intestinal symptoms and biomarkers after 6 weeks of dietary intervention in 46 patients with GI disorders. Dysbiosis in fungal composition and diversity was observed, with a significantly lower abundance of Sordariomycetes, Leotiomycetes, and Orbiliomycetes; a significantly higher abundance of Saccharomycetes; the Chytridiomycota and Mucoromycota phyla were significantly reduced; and the bacterial microbiota remained unchanged. In addition, various GI disorders decreased and associations between stool consistency and intestinal permeability were found with the bacterial genera Alistipes and Roseburia. Thus, the data suggest that MD can alter the fungal intestinal microbiota and improve GI disorders."

Mediterranean diet (MD) as a healthy anti-inflammatory dietary pattern has been reported to be associated with several inflammatory diseases. This study aimed to assess the association between the adherence to Mediterranean diet (aMED) and female UI. METHODS: Data of study women aged ≥18 years old and diagnosed as stress UI and urgency UI were extracted from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2018. Dietary intake information was obtained by 24-h dietary recall interview. Covariates included sociodemographic information, physical examination, and history of diseases and medication were extracted from the database. The weighted univariable and multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the association between aMED and different types of UI, with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analysis were further evaluated this association based on different age, body mass index (BMI), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), depression and smoking. RESULTS: Totally, 13,291 women were included, of whom 5,921 (44.55%) had stress UI, 4276 (32.17%) had urgency UI and 2570 (19.34%) had mixed UI. After adjusted all covariates, high aMED score was associated with the lower odds of urgency (OR = 0.86, 95%CI: 0.75-0.98) and mixed UI (OR = 0.84, 95%CI: 0.70-0.99), especially in female, aged 45-60 years old, NLR ≥1.68 and had smoking history. No relationship was found between the aMED and stress UI (P >0.05). CONCLUSION: Greater aMED was connected with the low odds of urgency UI and mixed UI among female. Adherence to an anti-inflammatory diet in daily life are a promising intervention to be further explored in female UI.",

In the present exploratory analysis, we assessed faecal fatty acids in the same cohort, aiming to investigate possible associations with intestinal barrier integrity. Women from the Lifestyle Intervention Study in Women with Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (LIBRE) randomised controlled trial, characterised by an impaired intestinal barrier integrity, followed either a Mediterranean diet (intervention group, n 33) or a standard diet (control group, n 35). At baseline (BL), month 3 (V1) and month 12 (V2), plasma lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, faecal zonulin and faecal fatty acids were measured. In the intervention group, faecal proportions of palmitoleic acid (16:1, n-7) and arachidonic acid (20:4, n-6) decreased, while the proportion of linoleic acid (18:2, n-6) and α linoleic acid (18:3, n-3) increased (BL-V1 and BL-V2, all P < 0·08). In the control group, faecal proportions of palmitic acid and arachidic acid increased, while the proportion of linoleic acid decreased (BL-V1, all P < 0·05). The decrease in the proportion of palmitoleic acid correlated with the decrease in plasma lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (ΔV1-BL r = 0·72, P < 0·001; ΔV2-BL r = 0·39, P < 0·05) and correlated inversely with adherence to the Mediterranean diet (Mediterranean diet score; ΔV1-BL r = -0·42, P = 0·03; ΔV2-BL r = -0·53, P = 0·005) in the intervention group. Our data show that adherence to the Mediterranean diet induces distinct changes in the faecal fatty acid composition. Furthermore, our data indicate that the faecal proportion of palmitoleic acid, but not faecal n-3 PUFA, is associated with intestinal barrier integrity in the intervention group."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: We have previously described that low adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) in elderly patients admitted in internal medicine wards is linked to poorer clinical outcomes. This investigation was designed to explore whether adherence to the MD is related to circulating markers of redox balance and inflammation in this clinical scenario. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed on 306 acute old patients hospitalized in internal medicine wards. Adherence to the MD was estimated by the Italian Mediterranean Index (IMI). The circulating markers of redox balance were assessed in serum and erythrocytes and correlated with inflammatory markers across different MD adherence groups. RESULTS: Compared to the patients with high adherence, those with low adherence to the MD exhibited severely impaired redox balance, as evidenced by a higher GSSG/GSH ratio and increased serum hydroxynonenal/malondialdehyde-protein adducts. No modifications were described in the expression of antioxidant enzymes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Patients with low adherence to the MD exhibited a higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and markers of systemic inflammation, as well as raised levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor, compared to those with high MD adherence. A strong association was observed between the circulating markers of redox balance and inflammation/immune response, with the highest regression coefficients found in the low adherence group. CONCLUSIONS: Old patients admitted to internal medicine wards with low adherence to the MD display unfavorable profiles of the circulating markers of redox balance and inflammation. It is conceivable that such effects on redox balance can be linked to the high polyphenol content of MD. This study supports the rationale for intervention trials that attest to the effectiveness of MD as a nutritional strategy for disease prevention.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Pegvaliase, a subcutaneous therapy to treat phenylketonuria (PKU), has allowed these patients to maintain adequate phenylalanine (Phe) blood values without following a Phe-controlled diet; this brings up the challenge of promoting healthy eating while moving away from prescription diets. In our center, every patient treated with Pegvaliase undergoes routine nutritional counseling aimed at promoting adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) during regular inpatient visits. This study aims to assess adherence to MedDiet and the adequacy of the diets of patients treated with Pegvaliase regarding micro- and macronutrients. METHODS: Seven patients on chronic therapy with Pegvaliase underwent a dietetic evaluation to assess the composition of their diets in terms of micro- and macronutrients; they were also administered the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) questionnaire. Subcategories from MDS were extracted to evaluate the consumption of foods typically included (vegetables, olive oil, etc.) and typically excluded (red meat, etc.) in the MedDiet. To assess the adequacy of the diet, nutrient and energy levels were compared with guidelines for the Italian population. RESULTS: MedDiet adherence in our sample was comparable to the general population; in terms of macronutrients, good adherence to the recommendations was observed, with every one of them met except for excessive simple sugar consumption. Micronutrient dietary intake was inadequate for zinc, iron, selenium, folate, thiamine, and riboflavin. CONCLUSIONS: While more work is necessary to help patients treated with Pegvaliase to progress toward healthy eating, our study suggests that nutritional counseling routinely performed during inpatient visits, typically twice a year, effectively promotes healthier eating habits than those observed in the general population.",

Results: At T1, compliant adult patients had significantly lower C26:0 levels [1.7 (1.2) vs. 2.5 µmol/L (1.7), p < 0.05], C26:0/C22:0 ratio [0.04 (0.02) vs. 0.06 (0.03), p < 0.05], and triglycerides [93 (56.5) vs. 128 mg/dL (109.5), p < 0.05] than non-compliant ones. C26:0 [2.4 (1.7) vs. 1.7 (1.2) µmol/L, p < 0.05], the C26:0/C22:0 ratio [0.06 (0.04) vs. 0.04 (0.02), p < 0.05], and cholesterol [173.5 (68.3) mg/dL vs. 157 (54) mg/dL, p < 0.05] were significantly reduced in compliant adult patients at T1 vs. baseline. As for carriers, the C26:0/C22:0 ratio was lower [0.02 (0.01) vs. 0.04 (0.009), p < 0.05] at T1 in compliant carriers, as compared to non-compliant ones. The C26:0/C22:0 [0.03 (0.02) vs. 0.02 (0.01) p < 0.05] and C24:0/C22:0 [1.0 (0.2) vs. 0.9 (0.3), p < 0.05] ratios were significantly decreased at T1 vs. T0. Conclusions: A VLCFA-restricted diet is effective in reducing plasma VLCFA levels and their ratios and must be strongly encouraged as support to therapy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD) is characterized by symptoms such as clenching, clicking, and locking of the jaw, often due to improper positioning affecting occlusion. Nearly half of TMD patients rarely require treatment, as symptoms typically diminish on their own within a year. Nevertheless, a significant majority of persons who are diagnosed with TMD do necessitate therapy, and it may take up to three years for complete remission to occur. This study aims to determine the extent to which a healthy nutritional model, specifically the Mediterranean diet, can enhance the effectiveness of existing therapeutic treatments, like physiotherapy with warm pads. METHODS: An interventional study design was implemented. Baseline scores were obtained pre- and post-intervention, while Mediterranean diet adherence was evaluated once at the beginning. A dependent samples t-test and a one-way multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) were used to test the experimental hypotheses. RESULTS: There is a statistically significant difference (p=0.04) between the three groups associated with Mediterranean diet adherence, as indicated by the mean differences on the Jaw Functional Limitation Scale (JFLS-20) questionnaire. Participants following a medium or high level of Mediterranean diet (≥18) reported fewer problems with jaw functionality both before and after the intervention compared to those with low (<18) adherence to the diet. CONCLUSION: Adherence to the Mediterranean diet appears to have a therapeutic effect on patients with TMD, offering a new dimension to their treatment. The primary benefit is the low cost of treatment, as the diet is easily accessible. This dietary approach could significantly enhance the management of TMD symptoms."

The Sustainable HEalthy Diet index was developed to measure the nutritional, environmental, and sociocultural components of sustainable diets and healthy eating patterns. However, a methodological approach has yet to be proposed for Turkish adults. This study aimed to determine the validity and reliability of the SHED index in Turkish adults. METHODS: Data were collected from 558 healthy adults using a web-based questionnaire. Internal consistency reliability was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha coefficient, and repeatability was evaluated using the test-retest method. Construct validity was investigated using the EAT-Lancet diet and the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), and the adapted SHED index structures' accordance was evaluated with confirmatory factor analysis. RESULTS: Good reliability and repeatability were found (r = 0.758 and 0.795, respectively). A higher SHED index score was related to a greater intake of grains, fruits, and vegetables and a lower intake of meat, eggs, and dairy compared to EAT-Lancet diet food groups. A higher SHED index score was associated with a lower saturated fat and added sugar intake. While the SHED index was associated with greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet (r = 0.334, p < 0.001), it was negatively associated with non-alcoholic and diet non-alcoholic beverage consumption (r = -0.257 and -0.264, respectively; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The SHED index showed good validity and reliability in Turkish adults. Our results suggest that the SHED index can be used in epidemiological and intervention studies because it allows the measurement of diets in terms of health and sustainability to propose adaptations accordingly.",

AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of the Mediterranean diet in improving liver function in children and adolescents with MASLD. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane CENTRAL for interventional studies investigating the effect of Mediterranean diet on MASLD in children and adolescents. The primary outcome was a change in liver function measured using these liver enzymes; Alanine Transaminase (ALT), Aspartate Transaminase (AST) and Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). The secondary outcomes were lipid profile, body weight, and insulin resistance. The risk of bias was assessed using the MASTER scale. Bias-adjusted inverse variance heterogeneity models were used to synthesize overall weighted mean differences for the treatment effect (WMD) and their 95% confidence intervals. Heterogeneity and publication bias were evaluated using the I2 statistics, Tau-squared and Doi plots, respectively. RESULT: Out of 5915 study records identified from database searches, five studies with 308 participants, two randomized controlled trials, and three quasi-experimental studies, met the inclusion criteria. In overall synthesis, the Mediterranean diet was associated with moderate improvements in liver function as shown by reductions in the liver enzymes [ALT - WMD - 10.85 U/L, 95% CI -20.03 to -1.68, I2 = 42, T2 = 38.8, AST - WMD - 9.26 U/L, 95% CI -17.14 to -1.38, I2 = 70.7, T2 = 42.7, and GGT - WMD - 1.99 95% CI -5.09 to 1.11)], but changes in body weight, lipid profile and insulin resistance were small and insignificant. CONCLUSION: The Mediterranean diet may improve liver function in children with MASLD. More randomized controlled trials are needed to develop high-certainty evidence on these findings.

Additionally, incorporating more plant-based foods into a Mediterranean diet may provide further health benefits. The study aimed to assess the effect of shifting from a traditional Mediterranean diet to a vegan Mediterranean diet on cardiorespiratory fitness and lipid profile in physically active and healthy men. METHODS AND RESULTS: Participants underwent a baseline period with adhesion to the general patterns of the Mediterranean diet for three weeks and then they changed to an isocaloric vegan version of the Mediterranean diet for four weeks, with a 7-day washout period between diets. The shift from the traditional Mediterranean diet to the vegan Mediterranean diet required substituting animal-based foods with plant-based foods that contain comparable amounts of protein and fat. Fourteen participants with a mean age of 24.6 ± 7.0 years (range: 18-37 years), completed the study protocol. The change from the traditional to the vegan Mediterranean diet reduced blood concentration of total cholesterol (-22.6 mg/dl, p < 0.01, Effect size [ES] = 1.07) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-12.8 mg/dl, p < 0.01, ES = 0.72). An inverse correlation was observed between the intake of dietary fibre and LDL-C (partial rho = -0.43, p = 0.040). CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of a vegan Mediterranean diet with plant-based proteins and fats instead of the traditional Mediterranean diet improved several cardiometabolic health outcomes in physically active and healthy men.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Mediterranean diet (MD), globally recognized for its sustainability and health benefits, traditionally emphasizes the consumption of plant-based foods in raw or minimally processed forms. However, shifting lifestyles, even in Mediterranean regions, have led to an increasing consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPF). Epidemiological evidence suggests that UPF consumption may be detrimental to human health, but there is only one clinical trial on this topic which is largely debated in the scientific community. This study aims to investigate the impact of the inclusion of UPF within a Mediterranean-based dietary pattern on cardiometabolic markers, gut microbiota, and other markers of human and planet health. METHODS: Fifty clinically healthy individuals showing overweight and presenting a low-to-moderate cardiovascular risk profile will be recruited for a 7-month randomized, open, cross-over dietary trial. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to a 3-month high-UPF MD (intervention group) or a low-UPF MD (control group), with a 1-month wash-out period. Both intervention diets will have identical food group compositions, with the intervention group consuming 5 servings/day of selected UPF items, and the control group consuming raw/minimally processed items from the same food group. Blood, urine, and fecal samples, alongside food/lifestyle diaries, will be collected from each participant before and after the dietary interventions. The primary endpoint will be the change in plasma LDL-cholesterol levels from baseline. Additional markers include blood pressure, anthropometric parameters, chemical parameters, glucose and lipid-related metabolic markers, incretins, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, fecal microbiota composition, and short-chain fatty acids. Finally, food waste production will be evaluated through specific validated food diaries. The study has been approved by the Ethical Committee of the University of Milan and the Tuscany Regional Ethics Committee of the Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria (AOU) - Careggi, Florence. DISCUSSION: Results from the PROMENADE study will improve knowledge about the impact of UPF consumption on human and planet health and will contribute to the scientific debate on this topic.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) and periphereal artery disease (PAD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: An observational sectional study was conducted with 174 patients diagnosed with T2DM, of which 78 patients had PAD. A patient was considered to have PAD if they obtained an ankle-brachial index (ABI) < 0.9 and/or absence of both distal pulses in one of the two feet. Data on sociodemographic and anthropometric variables, physical activity, smoking habits, biochemical blood parameters, and comorbidities were recorded. Good adherence to the MD was considered with a score ≥ 9 in MEDAS-14. Vascular factors independently associated with adherence to the MD in patients with T2DM were identified through multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: ABI, DFU, intermittent claudication and pedal pulse absence correlated with MD adherence. DFU, intermittent claudication and posterior tibial pulse absence were associated with the final score obtained in the MEDAS-14. Nut consumption, white meat preference and sautéed dish intake were associated with PAD presence. Multivariate analysis linked MD adherence to sex (OR = 0.044, 95 % CI 0.003-0619), age (OR = 0.139, 95 % CI 0.029-0.666), duration of T2DM (OR = 7.383, 95 % CI 1.523-35.779) and age at diagnosis of T2DM (OR = 6082, 95 % IC 1.415-26.136), as well as the presence of DFU (OR = 0.000, 95 % IC 0.000-0.370) and intermittent claudication (OR = 0.004, 95 % IC 0.000-0.534). CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to the MD is associated with a reduction in vascular complications in T2DM, highlighting its potential as a dietary intervention strategy.",

These diseases also seriously affect the quality of life in working-age individuals. Beyond the characterization of metabolic, genetic, and environmental factors related to ocular pathologies, it is important to verify how lifestyle may participate in the induction of the molecular pathways underlying these diseases. On the other hand, scientific studies are also contributing to investigations as to whether lifestyle could intervene in modulating pathophysiological cellular responses, including the production of metabolites and neurohormonal factors, through the intake of natural compounds capable of interfering with molecular mechanisms that lead to ocular diseases. Nutraceuticals are promising in ameliorating pathophysiological complications of ocular disease such as inflammation and neurodegeneration. Moreover, it is important to characterize the nutritional patterns and/or natural compounds that may be beneficial against certain ocular diseases. The adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MeDi) is proposed as a promising intervention for the prevention and amelioration of several eye diseases. Several characteristic compounds and micronutrients of MeDi, including vitamins, carotenoids, flavonoids, and omega-3 fatty acids, are proposed as adjuvants against several ocular diseases. In this review, we focus on studies that analyze the effects of MeDi in ameliorating diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, and glaucoma. The analysis of knowledge in this field is requested in order to provide direction on recommendations for nutritional interventions aimed to prevent and ameliorate ocular diseases.",

We previously demonstrated that mitochondrial respiratory capacity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was significantly reduced in patients with MASLD compared to non-MASLD controls. For MASLD treatment, guidelines recommend behavioral and dietary changes to reduce body weight. A recent 12-month clinical trial demonstrated that ameliorating patients' lifestyles through improved adherence to the Mediterranean diet and encouraged physical activity results in MASLD remission or regression. Methods: As a sub-study of the 12-month clinical trial, we evaluated the effects of the Mediterranean diet-oriented intervention on PBMC mitochondrial DNA content and respiratory parameters and on various biomarkers associated with MASLD. Results: Contrary to what was found at the baseline, after twelve months of intervention, systemic inflammatory and bioenergetics parameters did not differ between MASLD patients (N = 15) and control subjects (N = 17). PBMCs from MASLD subjects showed rescued basal respiration, ATP-linked respiration, maximal respiration, and spare respiratory capacity. The observed recovery coincided with a significant increase in the patients' adherence to the Mediterranean diet (Medscore). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that a Mediterranean diet-oriented intervention, without calorie reduction, preserves blood cell mitochondrial function in MASLD subjects. Thus, PBMC bioenergetics-based assays might be taken into account not only for diagnosing but also for monitoring therapeutic responses in MASLD."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Emerging evidence highlights the potential advantages of the Mediterranean diet (MD) in preserving kidney function and slowing chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. However, interventional studies on the MD are scarce in East Asian populations. METHODS: This randomized crossover trial aimed to assess the safety and short-term impact of the Mediterranean Proper Optimal Balance (MEDi-POB) diet in Korean patients with stage 3-4 CKD. Kidney function was assessed using the estimated glomerular filtration rate, which was calculated using the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration equation. Fifty patients with CKD were randomly assigned to two groups, each starting with a different 4-week intervention, followed by a 4-week washout period, followed by a switch to the other 4-week intervention. During the MEDi-POB intervention, patients received home delivery of meals twice daily, 5 days a week, while the control intervention comprised a conventional diet. Forty-six patients successfully completed the entire 12-week trial. Paired t-tests were conducted to assess mean differences between the two groups. A linear mixed model was used to adjust for sequence and period. RESULTS: Dietary fat, fiber, and niacin intake were significantly higher following the MEDi-POB diet than following the control diet (p = 0.001 for fat, p < 0.001 for fiber, and p = 0.007 for niacin). The MEDi-POB diet also yielded slightly increased total CO2 levels (p = 0.043), indicating effective management of metabolic acidosis. Conversely, sodium and copper intake were significantly lower with the MEDi-POB diet (p = 0.032 and p = 0.037, respectively). Caloric intake increased, but body mass index slightly decreased from baseline after consuming the MEDi-POB diet. Dietary potassium intake exhibited a non-significant increase (p = 0.053), and no significant changes in serum (p = 0.883) and urine potassium levels (p = 0.087) occurred. Kidney function remained well-preserved following the MEDi-POB diet. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the MEDi-POB diet is safe even in patients with advanced CKD, as it does not adversely affect serum and urine potassium levels and helps maintain kidney function."

      "abstract": "Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) face increased cardiovascular risk not fully explained by traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Arterial stiffness, inflammation and disease-related therapies may be contributors to augmented cardiovascular risk, whereas healthy dietary habits could help in their management. The aim of the present study was to analyze the association of the adherence to the Mediterranean Diet with arterial stiffness, inflammation, and disease-related medication in women with SLE. A total of 76 women with SLE were included in this cross-sectional exploratory study. The adherence to the Mediterranean Diet was assessed using the Mediterranean Diet Score. Arterial stiffness was measured through pulse wave velocity (PWV). Inflammatory profile was evaluated through high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). The use (yes / no) and doses (mg /day and cumulative dose over the last 3 years) of corticosteroids and immunosuppressants were also registered. No association of the overall adherence to the Mediterranean Diet with PWV, hsCRP or medication use was found (all P>.05). Lower intake of full dairy products was related to greater odds of corticosteroids use (odds=1.72; P=.004), and both higher current (β=0.29; P=.024) and cumulative (β=0.21; P=.040) doses. Lower intake of red wine was associated with lower odds of immunosuppressants use (odds=0.63; P=.008). No association of the adherence to the Mediterranean Diet with arterial stiffness, inflammation or disease-related medication was observed in women with SLE with mild disease activity. However, higher dairy products and lower red wine consumption were related to lower use of disease-related medication. Future intervention studies are needed to better understand how nutritional education promoting Mediterranean Diet food groups can complement conventional SLE treatments.",

      "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most common liver disease worldwide, affecting 30% of the population in Western countries. MASLD is considered the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, pathophysiologically underpinned by insulin resistance and frequently co-exists with hypertension, central obesity and dyslipidaemia. Currently, safe and effective pharmacotherapies for MASLD are limited, making weight loss with lifestyle changes the mainstay therapy. A Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) has emerged as an effective dietary pattern for preventing and managing MASLD, but most studies have been conducted in Mediterranean countries, necessitating further investigation into its benefits in Western populations. Additionally, the effect of holistic multimodal lifestyle interventions, including physical activity combined with the MedDiet, is not well established. Finally, MASLD's widespread prevalence and rapid growth require improved accessibility to interventions. Digital health delivery platforms, designed for remote access, could be a promising approach to providing timely support to individuals with MASLD. This narrative review summarises the current evidence related to the effects of the MedDiet in Western, multicultural populations with MASLD. This includes a detailed description of the composition, prescription and adherence to dietary interventions in terms of how they have been designed and applied. The evidence related to the role of physical activity or exercise interventions prescribed in combination with the MedDiet for MASLD will also be reviewed. Finally, recommendations for the design and delivery of dietary and physical activity or exercise interventions to inform the design of future randomised controlled trials to facilitate the optimal management of MASLD are outlined.",

Working in this direction, the University of Torino led the Wellness@Work for UniTo Project (W@W), with the aim of promoting employees' health. Internal university professionals assessed body composition and adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD), giving on-target advice for improving lifestyle. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of the W@W Project after a 4-month intervention period. This project was addressed to university employees, who could participate on a voluntary basis. Researchers assessed (T1) socio-demographic information and collected anthropometric variables. Body composition was evaluated through Classic and Specific Bioelectrical impedance Vector Analysis (BIVA). Adherence to the MD was assessed through the Medi-Lite questionnaire. After the assessments, participants were given 5-min counselling from internal professionals. After about 4 months, participants were supposed to undergo same assessments (T2). Overall, 479 workers joined the project, and of those, 246 came back for the T2 assessment. Globally, either anthropometric, body composition, or MD variables improved significantly after 4 months, both for male and female samples, suggesting how an easy-to-apply WHP intervention could help to improve workers' health.",

      "abstract": "This review explores the multifaceted relationship between dietary factors and breast cancer outcomes, focusing on unsaturated fats, the Mediterranean diet (MD), and other nutritional components. Breast cancer remains a significant global health concern, with lifestyle factors like diet playing a pivotal role in prevention and management. The review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. Articles written in English and released between 2019 and 2024 were acceptable. We used pertinent search terms such as \"unsaturated fats\", \"Mediterranean diet\", \"breast cancer\", and \"nutrition\" to perform searches in PubMed, PubMed Central (PMC), EBSCOhost, and grey literature such as Google Scholar. After screening, 11 of the 479 original papers were chosen and included in the final review. These include cross-sectional analysis and systematic review, cohort study, narrative review, systematic review and meta-analysis, case-control study, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and cross-sectional study. Key findings suggest that adherence to the MD correlates with improved quality of life measures and reduced mortality rates among women with breast cancer, particularly in older age groups. The diet's emphasis on antioxidant-rich foods, anti-inflammatory compounds, and healthy fats contributes to these observed benefits. Specific unsaturated fats, notably omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) like docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), demonstrate anti-cancer properties by modulating cancer cell behavior and enhancing treatment responses. Biomarkers associated with the MD, such as β-carotene and lycopene, serve as indicators of dietary compliance and potential risk reduction. Furthermore, components found in olive oil, including polyphenols and monounsaturated fatty acids, exhibit promising effects in preventing breast cancer by exerting antioxidant and anti-proliferative actions. Other dietary factors like calcium, legumes, fruits, and vegetables also play a role in reducing breast cancer risk and improving survival rates. This review underscores the importance of dietary interventions in optimizing outcomes for breast cancer patients and highlights the need for further research to elucidate underlying mechanisms and refine dietary recommendations."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized cross-over trial, 62 overweight adults were assigned to a Mediterranean or a low-fat vegan diet for 16-week periods in random order, separated by a 4-week washout. Body weight was the primary outcome. Three-day diet records were analyzed using the Nutrition Data System for Research software and dietary AGEs were estimated, using an established database. Statistical approaches appropriate for crossover trials were implemented. RESULTS: Dietary AGEs decreased by 73%, that is, by 9,413 kilounits AGE/day (95% -10,869 to -7,957); p < 0.001, compared with no change on the Mediterranean diet (treatment effect -10,303 kilounits AGE/day [95% CI -13,090 to -7,516]; p < 0.001). The participants lost 6.0 kg on average on the vegan diet, compared with no change on the Mediterranean diet (treatment effect -6.0 kg [95% CI -7.5 to -4.5]; p < 0.001). Changes in dietary AGEs correlated with changes in body weight (r = +0.47; p < 0.001) and remained significant after adjustment for total energy intake (r = +0.39; p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Dietary AGEs did not change on the Mediterranean diet but decreased on a low-fat vegan diet, and this decrease was associated with changes in body weight, independent of energy intake.

The nutritional program was based on Mediterranean a diet. Body composition, emotional intelligence, physiological stress and ventilatory response were assessed for all groups before and after intervention. Mixed ANOVA showed main effects of diet and training interventions on emotional attention (F = 8.042; p = 0.006), clarity (F = 9.306; p = 0.003), repair (F = 5.527; p = 0.022), Forced-Expiratory-Volume (F = 30.196; p < 0.000) and Forced-Vital-Capacity (F = 21.052; p < 0.000), with both interventions improving emotional intelligence and ventilatory variables. Bonferroni post-hoc analysis revealed significant differences of RTG and CG for emotional attention (MD = 4.60; p = 0.023), comprehension (MD = 5.734; p = 0.005), repair (MD = 8.576; p < 0.000), FEV1 (MD = 0.862; p = 0.005), and FCV (MD = 1.608; p < 0.001); with similar results when comparing NTG and CG: emotional attention (MD = 4.156; p = 0.041), comprehension (MD = 4.473; p = 0.033), repair (MD = 6.511; p = 0.001), Forced-Expiratory-Volume (MD = 1.608; p < 0.001), and Forced-Vital-Capacity (MD = 1.183; p < 0.001). No significant effects of experimental groups were observed for physiological stress variables (p > 0.05). This results suggests that respiratory training enhances emotional intelligence and lessens respiratory fatigue in musicians, and a combination of a Mediterranean diet and respiratory muscle training further boosts emotional intelligence, albeit with limited impact on physiological stress. This study represents a novel investigation into the approach by dietary interventions and respiratory muscle training in wind musicians since there are no studies that analyze it."

METHODS: Five databases (Medline, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL and ProQuest) were searched from inception to November 2022. Inclusion criteria were: (i) systematic review of randomised controlled studies with metanalysis; (ii) adults ≥18 years from the general population with (secondary prevention) and without (primary prevention) established cardiovascular disease; (iii) Mediterranean Diet compared with another dietary intervention or usual care. Review selection and quality assessment using AMSTAR-2 were completed in duplicate. GRADE was extracted from each review, and results were synthesised narratively. RESULTS: Eighteen meta-analyses of 238 randomised controlled trials were included, with an 8% overlap of primary studies. Compared to usual care, the Mediterranean Diet was associated with reduced cardiovascular disease mortality (n = 4 reviews, GRADE low certainty; risk ratio range: 0.35 [95% confidence interval: 0.15-0.82] to 0.90 [95% confidence interval: 0.72-1.11]). Non-fatal myocardial infarctions were reduced (n = 4 reviews, risk ratio range: 0.47 [95% confidence interval: 0.28-0.79] to 0.60 [95% confidence interval: 0.44-0.82]) when compared with another active intervention. The methodological quality of most reviews (n = 16/18; 84%) was low or critically low and strength of evidence was generally weak. CONCLUSIONS: This review showed that the Mediterranean Diet can reduce fatal cardiovascular disease outcome risk by 10%-67% and non-fatal cardiovascular disease outcome risk by 21%-70%. This preventive effect was more significant in studies that included populations with established cardiovascular disease. Better quality reviews are needed.",

Dietary factors make this pathology more common at younger ages and closely related to oral health. This study attempts to investigate the association between the oral health status of a Mexican population in the state of Yucatan and their dietary habits. OBJECTIVE: This study explores the relationship between oral health-related quality of life and adherence to the Mediterranean diet in a disadvantaged population in the state of Yucatan, Mexico. METHODS: The research was conducted in July 2023 in Merida, Yucatan (Mexico). The sample consisted of 109 individuals aged between 4 and 72 years old. Data analysis focused on factors such as body mass index (BMI), oral health-related quality of life, and adherence to the Mediterranean diet. RESULTS: A notable presence of caries is observed in individuals with low adherence to the Mediterranean diet (Correlation coefficient 0.040, p=0.682). This underscores the potential interaction between oral health, obesity, and dietary habits. The mean Oral Health-Related Quality of Life (OHIP-14Sp) score was 13.19 ±13.57, median 8.00. CONCLUSIONS: This research adds to the increasing evidence that highlights the significance of a balanced diet in enhancing the oral quality of life for people. More research is necessary to explore preventive measures and treatment to raise awareness about oral health within the community."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Healthy dietary patterns and exercise practices have been associated with improved metabolic and inflammatory profiles. However, studies regarding the combined effect of these interventions on plasma biomarkers and metabolome in older adults are sparser. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the impact of a combined Mediterranean Diet-based Sustainable Healthy Diet (SHD) and Multicomponent Training (MT) intervention on the plasma biomarkers and metabolome and how dietary intake and exercise could modulate these effects. METHODS: SHD intervention included a weekly supply of Mediterranean Diet-based SHD food and four nutrition sessions involving a Mediterranean-Diet culinary workshop, and the exercise program included 50-min MT group sessions, held three times a week, lasting both 12 weeks. Plasma biomarkers were obtained through standard biochemical analysis. A proton (1H) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy-based metabolomics approach was used to study the metabolome in blood plasma. Repeated measures ANOVA were performed and adjusted for confounders. RESULTS: SHD + MT intervention significantly decreased HDL-C and calcium. SHD + MT showed some changes in common with the SHD and MT group, namely a significant decrease in citrate levels (p = 0.009 for SHD + MT; p = 0.037 for SHDT) and an increase in pyruvate (p < 0.001 for MT and SHD + MT). The SHD + MT group also revealed specific changes in the levels of some amino acids (decrease in alanine, glutamine and lysine: p = 0.026; p < 0.001; p = 0.038, respectively). Increases in formate (p = 0.025) and unsaturated lipids (p = 0.011) are consistent with changes in energy and lipoprotein metabolism. CONCLUSION: Our data show that a combined lifestyle intervention program, including a Mediterranean Diet-based SHD and MT, could modulate biomarker and metabolome and there seems to be a metabolic path associated to these interventions in older adults. Due to its wide-ranging relevance, it is pertinent to assess to what extent combined SHD and MT can contribute to better clinical profiles.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects a Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) versus the Irish Healthy Eating Guidelines (HEG) on physical function and quality of life in adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Ireland. METHODS: Forty-four adults with RA were randomised (1:1) to the MedDiet or HEG for 12 weeks. The intervention included three video teleconsultations and two follow-up telephone calls facilitated by a Registered Dietitian (RD). Changes in physical function by Health Assessment Questionnaire- Disability Index (HAQ-DI) and quality of life by Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RAQoL) were the primary outcomes measured. Secondary outcomes included changes in dietary adherence, physical activity by Yale Physical Activity survey (YPAS), patient-perceived pain and general health, and anthropometric measures. All measurements were administered at baseline and repeated at 6 and 12 weeks. RESULTS: Forty participants completed the study. Participants were primarily females (87.5%), mean age was 47.5 ± 10.9 years. At the end of the intervention, participants in the MedDiet group reported significantly better physical function (p = 0.006) and quality of life (p = 0.037) compared to HEG group. From baseline to 12 weeks, physical function significantly improved in both diet groups, MedDiet (0.9 ± 0.5 to 0.5 ± 0.4 units, p < 0.001) and HEG (1.4 ± 0.7 to 1.0 ± 0.6 units, p < 0.001). Quality of life also significantly improved in the MedDiet (10.1 ± 7.5 to 4.0 ± 4.7 units, p < 0.001) and HEG group (11.25 ± 7.2 to 7.9 ± 6.4 units, p = 0.048). Physical activity improved significantly in the MedDiet (56.7 ± 28.6 to 70.6 ± 33.5 points, p = 0.01) but not within the HEG group despite similar recommendations. CONCLUSION: Adhering to the MedDiet and Irish Healthy Eating Guidelines resulted in improvements in RA patient-reported outcomes. The changes observed in both diet groups are likely due to the improvement in overall diet quality irrespective of dietary prescription. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04262505.",

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major global health concern and represents a significant public health challenge in Hungary, where it exhibits some of the highest morbidity and mortality rates in the European Union. The Mediterranean diet has been suggested to reduce the incidence of CRC, but comprehensive evidence from diverse study designs is needed to substantiate this effect. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, CENTRAL, and the Web of Science to identify randomized controlled trials and human clinical trials from 2008 to 2024 to identify relevant studies. Statistical analysis was performed using the https://metaanalysisonline.com web application using a random effects model to estimate the pooled hazard rates (HRs). Forest plots, funnel plots, and Z-score plots were utilized to visualize results. We identified 15 clinical trials and 9 case-control studies, encompassing a total of 2,217,404 subjects. The pooled analysis indicated that adherence to the Mediterranean diet significantly reduced the prevalence of CRC (HR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.78-0.91, p < 0.01). This protective effect was consistent across sexes, with HRs of 0.85 (95% CI = 0.75-0.97, p = 0.01) for males and 0.88 (95% CI = 0.79-0.99, p = 0.03) for females. Case-control studies specifically showed a substantial effect (HR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.38-0.68, p < 0.01). Notable heterogeneity was observed across studies, yet the a priori information size was substantially below the cumulative sample size, ensuring sufficient data for reliable conclusions. The findings from this meta-analysis reinforce the protective role of the Mediterranean diet against CRC. The results of this meta-analysis will inform dietary interventions designed to mitigate CRC risk, which are conducted within the framework of the Semmelweis Study, an ongoing comprehensive cohort study at Semmelweis University, designed to explore the multifaceted causes of unhealthy aging in Hungary. These interventions aim to explore the practical application of Mediterranean dietary patterns in reducing CRC incidence among the Hungarian population.",

METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial (2017-2020), including 1,221 singleton pregnancies at high risk for small-for-gestational age. Participants were randomized into three groups at 19-23 weeks' gestation: Mediterranean diet intervention, stress reduction program, or usual care. A detailed neurosonography was performed on 881 participants at mean (SD) 33.4 (1.1) weeks' gestation. Neurosonographic measurements were done offline. ASQ was performed on 276 infants at 1 year of corrected age. RESULTS: Biparietal diameter was similar among study groups. Mediterranean diet group fetuses had deeper insula (26.80 [1.68] versus 26.63 [1.75], mm, p = 0.02) and longer corpus callosum (42.98 [2.44] versus 42.62 [2.27], mm, p = 0.04), with a lower rate of suboptimal score infants in ASQ problem-solving domain (6.2 vs. 16.3%, p = 0.03). Stress reduction group fetuses had deeper insula (26.90 [1.75] versus 26.63 [1.75], mm, p = 0.04) and lower rates of suboptimal score infants in ASQ fine motor domain (4.3 vs. 12.8%, p = 0.04), compared to usual care group fetuses. CONCLUSION: Maternal structured intervention during pregnancy of the trial has the potential to modify offspring's neurodevelopment.",

      "abstract": "Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as a leading cause of several chronic diseases, imposing a significant global economic burden. The Mediterranean diet (MD) and low-fat diet (LFD) are the two primary recommended dietary patterns that exhibit distinct positive effects on treating NAFLD. Objective: To investigate which of the two diets, MD and LFD, is more effective in the treatment of NAFLD. Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to April 2024 were searched for in PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, Scopus and Embase. Interventions included MD or LFD, with primary outcome measures being intrahepatic lipid, liver stiffness, triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance. Secondary outcomes included weight, waist circumference, and body mass index. Use of random effects meta-analysis to assess outcomes of interest. Results: meta-analysis revealed no significant differences between MD and LFD in improving liver enzymes, liver fat, and related indices in NAFLD patients. Our findings provide compelling evidence for patients and healthcare professionals, allowing patients to choose a dietary pattern that aligns with their preferences and disease conditions. In summary, both MD and LFD can equivalently ameliorate NAFLD in the short term. Conclusions: Our results show that MD and LFD have similar therapeutic effects on liver enzymes and liver fat content in patients with NAFLD in the short term. Furthermore, our meta-analysis results have also opened up a new avenue of thought as to whether similar effects are achieved by alternating MD and LFD on alternate days.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dietary habits significantly influence the risks of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Through metabolomics, we've previously measured plasma metabolites to gauge dietary quality, introducing a healthy dietary metabolic signature (HDMS) linked to a decreased risk of future type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease. OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of a 6-day dietary intervention on plasma metabolites and the HDMS. METHODS: Fifty-nine Swedish participants (71% women, mean age 69 years) underwent a 6-day Mediterranean diet (MD) intervention in Italy's Cilento region. All meals, crafted from local recipes and ingredients, were provided. Metabolite profiling pre- and post-intervention was conducted with a UHPLC-QTOF. Alterations in metabolite levels and the HDMS were examined using paired T-test. RESULTS: The MD intervention notably enhanced the HDMS across participants (mean increase: 1.3 standard deviations (SD), 95% CI 1.1-1.4, p = 6E-25). Out of 109 metabolites, 66 exhibited significant alterations (fdr adjusted p < 0.05). Among the 10 most significant changes, increases were observed in several diet related metabolites such as pipecolate, hippurate, caffeine, homostachydrine, acylcarnitine C11:0, acetylornithine, beta-carotene and 7-methylguanine. The most significant decreases manifested in piperine and 3-methylhistidine. CONCLUSIONS: The HDMS, which is linked to a healthy diet and inversely associated with cardiometabolic disease, was significantly improved by the 6-day Mediterranean diet intervention. Notably, metabolite markers previously shown to be indicative of the intake of vegetables, fruits, grains, and legumes increased, while markers previously associated with red meat consumption decreased. These findings highlight the potential of short-term dietary interventions to induce significant changes in plasma metabolite profiles.",

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Emerging evidence is placing the Mediterranean diet (MD) in the spotlight as a potential dietary model that could benefit inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients in terms of prevention and progress of the disease. The main aim of the present study is to shed some light on the relationship between the adherence to the MD and the degree of disease activity, as well as the quality of life in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Materials and Methods: An administered questionnaire was used to assess and record a number of parameters, including recent medical and weight history, anthropometric characteristics, disease activity (in remission or active disease), and quality of life of both male and female CD patients. Moreover, the level of compliance of the participants to the Mediterranean diet model was evaluated and its relationship with disease activity and quality of life was investigated. Results: Adherence to the MD was significantly higher in patients with inactive disease than in those with active disease (p = 0.019). According to the correlation analysis conducted, adherence to the MD was negatively correlated with disease activity (p = 0.039) and positively correlated with quality of life (QoL) (p = 0.046) of the participants. Intake of fruits, vegetables, and dairy products was significantly higher in remission patients (p = 0.046, p = 0.001, p = 0.041, respectively). Conclusions: We conclude, according to the findings of the study, that adherence to the MD is associated with disease activity and QoL in patients with CD. Future research should focus on MD intervention studies on IBD patients in order to assess its effect on modulating disease activity/course and related inflammatory biomarkers.",

      "abstract": "Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is associated with obesity and other related comorbidities, which impose an additional burden on disease activity and response to treatment. We investigated the impact of Mediterranean diet, and exercise on the presentation and severity of PsA. Three hundred fifty-five patients with PsA (n = 279) and psoriasis (PsO) (n = 76) were included in a cross-sectional study. Demographic and clinical characteristics and dietary and exercise patterns were recorded. Patients were grouped into (i) high, moderate, and low Mediterranean diet adherence and (ii) high, medium, and low activity level. Levels of diet and exercise were correlated with disease activity indices. PsA patients had more comorbidities than their PsO counterparts (42.7% vs. 26.3%, p = .038). The majority showed a low exercise pattern (total = 71.3%, PsA = 72.4%, PsO = 67.1%). Approximately half (total = 44.2%, PsA = 43.4%, PsO = 47.4%) did not follow a Mediterranean diet. Disease Activity in Psoriatic Arthritis Score (DAPSA) (p = .004), tender (p = .003) and swollen (p = .015) joint counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (p = .001), and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) (p = .015) had an inverse correlation with exercise. Higher Mediterranean diet adherence was associated with reduced ESR (p = .056), PASI (p = .011), and body surface area (BSA) (p = .009) indices. After adjusting for body mass index (BMI), exercise retained its positive correlation with PsA disease activity, but diet showed significant correlation only with enthesitis (p = 0.015). Uptake of a Mediterranean diet and exercise have positive effects on PsA activity, independently of BMI. These findings support lifestyle recommendations to supplement conventional treatment for improvement in disease outcomes. Key points • Diet and lifestyle are important influencers of health-related outcomes in PsA. • In this cross-sectional study of 355 patients with psoriatic disease, we found that Med Diet and exercise improve outcomes in PsA independently of weight loss. • Our results suggest that diet and lifestyle modifications should supplement conventional medical treatments.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Diabetes Telemedicine Mediterranean Diet (DiaTeleMed) Study is a fully remote randomized clinical trial evaluating personalized dietary management in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The study aims to test the efficacy of a personalized behavioral approach for dietary management of moderately controlled T2D, versus a standardized behavioral intervention that uses one-size-fits-all dietary recommendations, versus a usual care control (UCC). The primary outcome will compare the impact of each intervention on the mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE). METHODS: Eligible participants are between 21 and 80 years of age diagnosed with moderately controlled T2D (HbA1c: 6.0 to 8.0%) and managed on lifestyle alone or lifestyle plus metformin. Participants must be willing and able to attend virtual counseling sessions and log meals into a dietary tracking smartphone application (DayTwo), and wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) for up to 12 days. Participants are randomized with equal allocation (n = 255, n = 85 per arm) to one of three arms: (1) Personalized, (2) Standardized, or (3) UCC. Measurements occur at 0 (baseline), 3, and 6 months. All participants receive isocaloric energy and macronutrient targets to meet Mediterranean diet guidelines, in addition to 14 intervention contacts over 6 months (4 weekly then 10 biweekly) to cover diabetes self-management education. The first 4 UCC intervention contacts are delivered via synchronous videoconferences followed by educational video links. Participants in Standardized receive the same educational content as those in the UCC arm, following the same schedule. However, all intervention contacts are conducted via synchronous videoconferences, paired with Social Cognitive Theory (SCT)-based behavioral counseling, plus dietary self-monitoring of planned meals using a mobile app that provides real-time feedback on calories and macronutrients. Participants in the Personalized arm receive all elements of the Standardized intervention, in addition to real-time feedback on predicted post-prandial glycemic response (PPGR) to meals and snacks logged into the mobile app. DISCUSSION: The DiaTeleMed Study aims to address an important gap in the current landscape of precision nutrition by determining the contributions of behavioral counseling and personalized nutrition recommendations on glycemic control in individuals with T2D. The fully remote methodology of the study allows for scalability and innovative delivery of personalized dietary recommendations at a population level.

However, the mechanism of action of these interventions remains still unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of Mediterranean diet and Stress reduction on placental volume and perfusion. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Participants in the Mediterranean diet group received monthly individual and group educational sessions, and free provision of extra-virgin olive oil and walnuts. Women in the Stress reduction group underwent an 8-week Stress reduction program adapted for pregnancy, consisting of weekly 2.5-h and one full-day sessions. Non-intervention group was based on usual care. Placental volume and perfusion were assessed in a subgroup of randomly selected women (n = 165) using magnetic resonance (MR) at 36-week gestation. Small placental volume was defined as MR estimated volume <10th centile. Perfusion was assessed by intravoxel incoherent motion. RESULTS: While mean MR placental volume was similar among the study groups, both interventions were associated with a lower prevalence of small placental volume (3.9% Mediterranean diet and 5% stress reduction vs. 17% non-intervention; p = 0.03 and p = 0.04, respectively). Logistic regression showed that small placental volume was significantly associated with higher risk of SGA in both study groups (OR 7.48 [1.99-28.09] in Mediterranean diet and 20.44 [5.13-81.4] in Stress reduction). Mediation analysis showed that the effect of Mediterranean diet on SGA can be decomposed by a direct effect and an indirect effect (56.6%) mediated by a small placental volume. Similarly, the effect of Stress reduction on SGA is partially mediated (45.3%) by a small placental volume. Results on placental intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion fraction and diffusion coefficient were similar among the study groups. CONCLUSIONS: Structured interventions during pregnancy based on Mediterranean diet or Stress reduction are associated with a lower proportion of small placentas, which is consistent with the previously observed beneficial effects of these interventions on fetal growth.",

The present study was aimed at investigating and confirming those results, with a follow up data collection, in the same sample, a year after the baseline intervention. Pre- and post-intervention assessments were conducted. Weight and height were measured. Eating patterns/lifestyle were assessed by the KIDMED test and questionnaires. Thirteen schools in three areas with low, medium and high prevalence of overweight/obesity (North, Center and South respectively) were involved, with a representative baseline cluster sample of 494 fourth class children (8-10 years old) in 2015. An intervention group and a control group were recruited in each school; the intervention group (n = 395) got the intervention, the control group (n = 99) did not. The children's KIDMED score changes were the main outcome measures. Differences in percentages of adherence and in yes/no answers on the KIDMED test, at baseline and after one year, for both the intervention and the control groups, were assessed through contingency tables and statistical tests. Improvements in the high and low adherence rates to MD were observed (high adherence: 24.4% to 43.3%; low adherence: 15.0% to 3.9%, p < 0.0001). The percentages of subjects with optimal adherence improved in both sexes (females: 25.5% to 49.5%, p < 0.0001; males: 23.1% to 36.6%, p < 0.0001) in all the geographical areas and ponderal status classes. Accompanying free distribution of fruit and vegetables with a nutritional intervention led by trained teachers with a cross-curricular approach can be successful in promoting healthy eating in children.",

OBJECTIVE: To review and analyze the randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that assessed the effects of MedDiet-based interventions on biomarkers of cardiometabolic health among children and adolescents. DATA SOURCES: Four electronic databases were searched (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus) from database inception to April 25, 2024. STUDY SELECTION: Only RCTs investigating the effect of interventions promoting the MedDiet on cardiometabolic biomarkers (ie, systolic blood pressure [SBP], diastolic blood pressure [DBP], triglycerides [TGs], total cholesterol [TC], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], glucose, insulin, and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]) among children and adolescents (aged ≤18 years) were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Data were extracted from the studies by 2 independent reviewers. Results across studies were summarized using random-effects meta-analysis. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The effect size of each trial was computed by unstandardized mean differences (MDs) of changes in biomarker levels (ie, SBP, DBP, TGs, TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR) between the intervention and the control groups. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach. RESULTS: Nine RCTs were included (mean study duration, 17 weeks; range, 8-40 weeks). These studies involved 577 participants (mean age, 11 years [range, 3-18 years]; 344 girls [59.6%]). Compared with the control group, the MedDiet-based interventions showed a significant association with reductions in SBP (mean difference, -4.75 mm Hg; 95% CI, -8.97 to -0.52 mm Hg), TGs (mean difference, -16.42 mg/dL; 95% CI, -27.57 to -5.27 mg/dL), TC (mean difference, -9.06 mg/dL; 95% CI, -15.65 to -2.48 mg/dL), and LDL-C (mean difference, -10.48 mg/dL; 95% CI, -17.77 to -3.19 mg/dL) and increases in HDL-C (mean difference, 2.24 mg/dL; 95% CI, 0.34-4.14 mg/dL). No significant associations were observed with the other biomarkers studied (ie, DBP, glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that MedDiet-based interventions may be useful tools to optimize cardiometabolic health among children and adolescents.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Diabetes Telemedicine Mediterranean Diet (DiaTeleMed) Study is a fully remote randomized clinical trial evaluating personalized dietary management in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The study aims to test the efficacy of a personalized behavioral approach for dietary management of moderately-controlled T2D, versus a standardized behavioral intervention that uses one-size-fits-all dietary recommendations, versus a usual care control (UCC). The primary outcome will compare the impact of each intervention on the mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE). METHODS: Eligible participants are between 21 to 80 years of age diagnosed with moderately-controlled T2D (HbA1c: 6.0-8.0%), and managed on lifestyle alone or lifestyle plus metformin. Participants must be willing and able to attend virtual counseling sessions and log meals into a dietary tracking smartphone application (DayTwo), and wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) for up to 12 days. Participants are randomized with equal allocation (n = 255, n = 85 per arm) to one of three arms: 1) Personalized, 2) Standardized, or 3) UCC. Measurements occur at 0 (baseline), 3, and 6 months. All participants receive isocaloric energy and macronutrients targets to meet Mediterranean diet guidelines plus 14 intervention contacts over 6 months (4 weekly then 10 biweekly) to cover diabetes self-management education. The first 4 UCC intervention contacts are delivered via synchronous videoconferences followed by educational video links. Participants in Standardized receive the same education content as UCC on the same schedule. However, all intervention contacts are conducted via synchronous videoconferences, paired with Social Cognitive Theory (SCT)-based behavioral counseling, plus dietary self-monitoring of planned meals using a mobile app that provides real-time feedback on calories and macronutrients. Participants in the Personalized arm receive all elements of the Standardized intervention, plus real-time feedback on predicted post-prandial glycemic response (PPGR) to meals and snacks logged into the mobile app. DISCUSSION: The DiaTeleMed study will address an important gap in the current landscape of precision nutrition by determining the contributions of behavioral counseling and personalized nutrition recommendations on glycemic control in individuals with T2D. The fully remote methodology of the study allows for scalability and innovative delivery of personalized dietary recommendations at a population level. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The DiaTeleMed Study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT05046886)."

Smoking accounts for ~ 85% of all cases, with a described joint effect with unhealthy diet in lung cancer risk increase. Public health policies to prevent carcinogens exposure, promote smoking cessation and advocacy for healthy nutrition, are therefore highly recommended. Here we have examined the benefits of the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) in protecting against some non-communicable diseases including lung cancer, highlighting the epidemiological and biomolecular aspects of MedDiet anti-inflammatory effect and its interaction with smoking habits closely linked to risk of lung cancer. Considering the high incidence and mortality rates of lung cancer, we discussed also about the global impact that a Planeterranean extension of the benefits of MedDiet could have on controlling lung cancer risk. We also debated the impact of personalized nutrition on lung cancer prevention, considering individual heterogeneity in response to diet plans as well as recent advancements on nutri-omics in lung cancer research, with a specific focus on the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) as a promising nutritional molecular hub for lung cancer prevention. We strongly believe that a deep understanding of the molecular link between food components and genetic/epigenetics factors can expand effective intervention strategies.",

      "abstract": "We Investigated how promoting diverse, healthy food options affects long-term dietary choices. We hypothesized that encouraging exploration of nutritious plant-based foods would lead to lasting improvements in diet. Participants (N = 211) were randomly assigned into two groups for a 6-week intervention: The fixed menu group was given the same large menu every week, while the changing menu group received a new small menu each week. At the end of the intervention both groups were exposed to the same menu suggestions. Food diversity evaluation was based on weekly reports collected during the intervention. Self-reported adherence to Mediterranean diet components was assessed using the I-MEDAS screener. The proportion of plant-based foods in participants' diets was estimated using a 0-100% scale based on self-report. Both items were evaluated using online questionnaires given to participants at baseline, at the end of the intervention, as well as three and six months after the intervention concluded. Results mean(SD) demonstrated that participants in fixed menu group explored a significantly wider array of items 26.33(11.64) than those in the changing menus group [19.79(10.29), t(202) = 4.25, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.60]. A repeated measures analysis of covariance rmANCOVA revealed that short-term increase in I-MEDAS and PBD score were noted in both groups; however, only participants with the fixed menu sustained this increase at months follow-up [diff = 1.50, t(132) = 4.50, p < 0.001 Our findings suggest that manipulating the rate of exposure to food suggestions may affect overall dietary variety. It seems that early presentation with options may increase overall dietary variety and may even support longer-term habits. This study contributes to developing effective interventions and highlights the challenge of promoting exploratory behavior in nutrition.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Mediterranean diet (MD) is recommended for all patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) unless there is a specific contraindication. Culinary medicine has emerged as a method for improving dietary education. Patients and caregivers are often invested in making dietary changes to improve disease control. Here, we examine the dietary preferences of a group of young people with IBD and apply culinary medicine techniques with an in-person MD-focused cooking class. METHODS: A survey evaluating dietary attitudes was sent to an IBD email listserv at our tertiary care center (n = 779). A validated questionnaire, the Mediterranean Diet Quality Index for Children and Adolescents was used to assess MD adherence. IBD dietitians customized 2 in-person MD-focused cooking classes, one for children 6 to 12 years of age (arm 1) and one for adolescents 13 to 17 years of age (arm 2). Baseline, 1-month follow-up, and 3-month follow-up surveys were completed. RESULTS: There were 112 survey responses. Participants were 67.0% male with diagnosis of Crohn's disease (50.0%), ulcerative colitis (42.0%), or IBD unclassified (8.0%). Most were managed on advanced therapies (82.0%). Most reported making decisions about diet (82.0%) in order to help with IBD, had met with a dietitian (69.0%), and were interested in learning more about the MD (55.3%). MD scores were primarily in the average (49.5%) and poor (41.1%) diet categories. Only those eating together as a family 3 or more times per week or those who had met with a dietitian scored in the optimal diet category. The median MD score at baseline was 4.5, increasing to 6.0 at 1 month and 7.0 at 3 months postintervention. Almost all (90%) would recommend cooking classes to others. Common barriers to MD uptake included lack of knowledge about which foods to prepare, concern about taste, and time to prepare food. CONCLUSIONS: This study showcases high patient and caregiver interest in dietary management of IBD and demonstrates efficacy of education via application of culinary medicine. Classes were well received by families and MD adherence scores increased postintervention. As patients with IBD and their families are often motivated to incorporate dietary therapy into their care, this work highlights the role of culinary medicine and value of future study.",

DESIGN: A prospective observational cohort study in the Reproductive and Genetic Hospital of CITIC-Xiangya from February 2023 to August 2023.Subjects: A total of 605 participants previously infected with COVID-19 were enrolled. EXPOSURE: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: The primary outcomes are oocyte and embryo quality. The secondary outcomes are pregnancy outcomes. RESULTS: A majority of participants (n = 517) followed low to moderate MeDiet, and only a small group of them (n = 88) followed high MeDiet. The blastocyst formation rate is significantly higher in MeDiet scored 8-14 points women (46.08%), compared to the other two groups (which is 41.75% in the low adherence population and 40.07% in the moderate adherence population respectively) (p = 0.044). However, the follicle number on hCG day, yield oocytes, normal fertilized zygotes, fertilization rate, day three embryos (cleavage embryos), and embryo quality are comparable among the three groups. For those who received embryo transfer, we noticed an obvious trend that with the higher MeDiet score, the higher clinical pregnancy rate (62.37% vs. 76.09% vs. 81.25%, p = 0.197), implantation rate (55.84% vs. 66.44% vs. 69.23%, p = 0.240) and ongoing pregnancy rate (61.22% vs. 75.00% vs. 81.25%, p = 0.152) even though the p values are not significant. An enlarging sample size study, especially in a high adherence population should be designed to further verify the effects of MeDiet's role in improving IVF performance. CONCLUSION: High adherence to MeDiet is associated with improved blastocyst formation in women after COVID-19 infection. There is also a trend that high adherence to MeDiet might be beneficial to clinical pregnancy, embryo implantation as well as ongoing pregnancy in these women."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the second-leading cause of death among Canadians. Clinical practice guidelines suggest that improvements to lifestyle, including dietary intake, can reduce the risk of CVD. OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of the study was to evaluate patient changes in adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (Medi-Diet) from baseline to 4-week and 6-month follow-up after participating in a 4-week, group-based, interdisciplinary cardiovascular health programme run by healthcare professionals (HCPs) in a primary care setting. Secondary outcomes included changes in blood pressure, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), triglycerides, non-HDL-c and haemoglobin A1c% from baseline to 6 months, and changes in knowledge scores from baseline to 4 weeks and 6 months. This study further aimed to compare outcomes between in-person programme delivery and virtual programme delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Participants (n=31) attended the Get Heart Smart (GHS) group-based educational and lifestyle behaviour change programme at the East Elgin Family Health Team for 4 weeks. Participants were 18 years or older and were referred by a HCP or self-referred to the GHS programme. Changes in the above-mentioned outcomes were evaluated. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the programme moved to a virtual mode of delivery, with 16 participants completing the programme in a virtual environment. Two-way repeated-measures analyses of variance were performed to explore if there were significant differences from baseline to 4-week and/or 6-month follow-up between groups (in-person compared with virtual) and within the pooled sample. RESULTS: At baseline and 4-week follow-up, there were significant between-group differences in knowledge scores. After 6-month follow-up, there were statistically significant within-group improvements in Medi-Diet scores and knowledge scores in the pooled sample (n=31), in-person sample (n=15) and virtual sample (n=16). Apart from triglycerides, changes in biomarkers were all non-significant. CONCLUSIONS: The GHS programme effectively facilitated long-term (6-month) improved cardiovascular/lifestyle knowledge and adherence to the Medi-Diet. Transitioning to a virtual programme delivery did not impact the program's ability to motivate nutrition-related behaviour change."

The objective was to assess the impact of personalized MD plans delivered via a CDSS on nutritional status and psychological well-being. Forty adolescent females (15-17 years) with PCOS were randomly assigned to the MD group (n = 20) or the Control group (n = 20). The MD group received personalized MD plans every 15 days via a CDSS, while the Control group received general nutritional advice. Assessments were conducted at baseline and after 3 months. Results showed significantly increased MD adherence in the MD group compared to the Control group (p < 0.001). The MD group exhibited lower intakes of energy, total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol, and higher intakes of monounsaturated fat and fiber (p < 0.05). Serum calcium and vitamin D status (p < 0.05), as well as anxiety (p < 0.05) were improved. In conclusion, tailored dietary interventions based on MD principles, delivered via a CDSS, effectively manage PCOS in adolescent females. These findings highlight the potential benefits of using technology to promote dietary adherence and improve health outcomes in this population. ClinicalTrials.gov registry: NCT06380010."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Mediterranean diet has been linked to reduced risk for several cardiometabolic diseases. The lack of a clear definition of the Mediterranean diet in the scientific literature and the documented proliferation of nutrition misinformation on the internet suggest the potential for confusion among consumers seeking web-based Mediterranean diet information. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a social media content analysis of information about the Mediterranean diet on the influential social media platform, TikTok, to examine public discourse about the diet and identify potential areas of misinformation. We then analyzed these findings in the context of health promotion to identify potential challenges and opportunities for the use of TikTok in promoting the Mediterranean diet for healthy living. METHODS: The first-appearing 202 TikTok posts that resulted from a search of the hashtag #mediterraneandiet were downloaded and qualitatively examined. Post features and characteristics, poster information, and engagement metrics were extracted and synthesized across posts. Posts were categorized as those created by health professionals and those created by nonhealth professionals based on poster-reported credentials. In addition to descriptive statistics of the entire sample, we compared posts created by professionals and nonprofessionals for content using chi-square tests. RESULTS: TikTok posts varied in content, but posts that were developed by health professionals versus nonprofessionals were more likely to offer a definition of the Mediterranean diet (16/106, 15.1% vs 2/96, 2.1%; P=.001), use scientific citations to support claims (26/106, 24.5% vs 0/96, 0%; P<.001), and discuss specific nutrients (33/106, 31.1% vs 6/96, 6.3%; P<.001) and diseases related to the diet (27/106, 25.5% vs 5/96, 5.2%; P<.001) compared to posts created by nonhealth professionals. CONCLUSIONS: Social media holds promise as a venue to promote the Mediterranean diet, but the variability in information found in this study highlights the need to create clear definitions about the diet and its components when developing Mediterranean diet interventions that use new media structures."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A Mediterranean diet has positive effects on the brain in mid-older adults; however, there is scarce information on pregnant individuals. We aimed to evaluate the effect of a structured Mediterranean diet intervention on the cortical structure of the maternal brain during pregnancy. METHODS: This study was a secondary analysis of the IMPACT BCN, a randomized clinical trial with 1221 high-risk pregnant women randomly allocated into three groups at 19-23 weeks of gestation: Mediterranean diet intervention, a mindfulness-based stress reduction program, or usual care. Maternal brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed during the third trimester of pregnancy in a random subgroup of participants. For this study, data from the Mediterranean diet and usual groups were analyzed. Maternal dietary intake, adherence to the Mediterranean diet and metabolite biomarkers were evaluated using a food frequency questionnaire, a 17-item dietary screener and plasma/urine samples, respectively. RESULTS: The cluster-wise analysis showed that the Mediterranean diet group participants (n = 34) had significantly larger surface areas in the right precuneus (90%CI: <0.0001-0.0004, p < 0.001) and left superior parietal (90%CI: 0.026-0.033, p = 0.03) lobules compared to the usual care group participants (n = 37). A larger right precuneus area was associated with high improvements in adherence to the Mediterranean diet, a high intake of walnuts and high concentrations of urinary hydroxytyrosol. A larger left superior parietal area was associated with a high intake of walnuts and high concentrations of urinary hydroxytyrosol. CONCLUSIONS: The promotion of a Mediterranean diet during pregnancy has a significant effect on maternal brain structure.",

      "abstract": "(1) Background: With the aging population, effective interventions are needed to enhance the health of older adults. This study investigated the combined effects of yoga and the Mediterranean diet on various health outcomes in community-dwelling older adults; (2) Methods: The study employed a randomized controlled trial design with a total of 116 older adults randomized to an experimental group (n = 57) that underwent a combined yoga and Mediterranean diet program and a control group (n = 59) that did not receive any intervention. Nutritional status was assessed using the Mini Nutritional Assessment, flexibility with the Back Scratch Test and the Chair Sit-and-Reach Test, balance, gait, and fall risk with the Tinetti Scale, and muscle strength with a dynamometer and the 30 s Chair Stand Test; (3) Results: Regarding nutritional status, there were significant differences between the experimental group and the control group (Cohen's d = 0.02). The participants in the experimental group showed greater balance (11.12 ± 3.01 vs. 10.03 ± 2.35, Cohen's d = 0.41 and gait (7.63 ± 1.96 vs. 6.69 ± 2.50, Cohen's d = 0.44) with respect to the control group. In terms of flexibility, the experimental group showed statistically significant improvements in the right arm (Cohen's d = 0.43), left arm (Cohen's d = 0.64), right perineum (Cohen's d = 0.42), and left leg (Cohen's d = 0.37) Finally, in terms of strength, participants in the experimental group experienced statistically significant improvements in grip strength and lower body strength (Cohen's d = 0.39 and 0.81, respectively); (4) Conclusions: The study highlights the potential benefits of a 12-week intervention combining yoga with a Mediterranean diet to improve the health and functional capacities of community-dwelling older adults.",

      "abstract": "Plant protein is considered a sustainable health-promoting strategy to prevent metabolic syndrome. Lifestyle changes (including dietary patterns and exercise) have been demonstrated to exert an effect on human health by modulating the biochemical status in humans. The objective of this study was to assess whether supplementation with hemp protein within a Mediterranean diet context together with exercise could help to ameliorate the metabolic statuses of patients prone to developing metabolic syndrome. For this study, 23 patients followed with Mediterranean diet and engaged in aerobic exercise according to the WHO's recommendations, while also being supplemented with hemp protein, for 12 weeks. A comparison of anthropometric, biochemical, and mineral data as well as amino acid values was made between the start and the end of the study, with the subjects acting as their own control group. Statistical analyses included a paired t-test, Wilcoxon paired test, Pearson correlation coefficient, and Sparse Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis to evaluate significant differences and correlations among parameters. There were statistically significant changes in total cholesterol, HDL-C (+52.3%), LDL-C (-54.0%), and TAG levels (-49.8%), but not in glucose plasma levels. Following the intervention, plasma concentrations of some amino acids, including α-aminoadipic acid, phosphoethanolamine, and 1-metylhistidine, increased, whereas those of asparagine and alanine declined. Different correlations between amino acids and the other parameters evaluated were reported and discussed. A Mediterranean diet combined with regular aerobic exercise, together with protein supplementation, can highly improve the metabolic parameters and anthropometric parameters of subjects with obesity and impaired glucose levels, ameliorating their health status and likely delaying the development of metabolic syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Adherence to the Mediterranean diet has been shown to lower the risk of developing chronic non-communicable diseases like cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Improvements in depression, participation in daily activities in older individuals, weight loss and a reduction in adverse pregnancy outcomes are associated with adherence to the Mediterranean diet. The number of studies that have evaluated barriers to adherence to the Mediterranean diet in the US and, in particular, in racial and ethnic minority populations within the US are few. Among Native American and Alaskan Native populations, studies evaluating traditional or alternative Mediterranean diet adherence for chronic non-infectious diseases is unavailable. Mediterranean diet scoring instruments used in studies in European and Mediterranean countries and among white participants in the US fail to capture the dietary patterns of racial and ethnic minority populations. In this narrative review, the food components of the traditional Mediterranean diet are discussed, adherence to the Mediterranean diet is examined in Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean countries and barriers preventing adherence to the Mediterranean diet in the US and among racial and ethnic minority populations is reviewed. Recommendations for improving nutrition education and intervention and for increasing adherence and cultural adaptions to the Mediterranean diet are provided."
