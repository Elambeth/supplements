      "abstract": "The rising demand for freshly cut agricultural produce like bananas, apples, pears, potatoes, and roots due to health concerns and modern lifestyles has heightened awareness of their susceptibility to browning, which diminishes their appeal and contributes to food waste. The present study explored the efficacy of natural anti-browning agents in prolonging the quality and shelf-life of freshly cut green banana slices. The bananas underwent treatment with normal water (NW), lemon juice (LJ), and coconut water (CW), and the changes in physicochemical properties, such as browning intensity, color, firmness, total soluble solid (TSS), total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and also microbial attributes, were evaluated during their storage at 4 ± 1°C for 12 days. The results demonstrated significant enhancements in treated samples compared to untreated ones. While normal water and lemon juice-treated banana slices exhibited visual browning during storage, coconut water immersion proved superior in maintaining visual appeal, whiteness, and lightness while delaying yellowing and browning. Coconut water-treated samples also displayed firmer texture (0.75 kg), lower TSS (5.67 °Brix), and reduced weight loss (9.14%) after 12 days, in contrast to samples subjected to lemon juice and normal water treatments which showed lesser texture (0.68 kg, 0.58 kg), higher TSS (5.87 °Brix, 6.10 °Brix), and greater weight loss (11.76%, 16.09%), respectively. Furthermore, coconut water-treated samples retained higher levels of total phenols (392.67 mg GAE (gallic acid equivalent)/100 g FW (fresh weight), total flavonoids (55.67 mg QE (quercetin equivalent)/100 g FW), and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity (38.68%). Coconut water treatment also significantly suppressed polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity (14 U/g) compared to lemon juice (16 U/g) and normal water (26 U/g) treatments, and untreated samples (133 U/g) after 12 days. Additionally, microbial load remained within acceptable limits for all samples, with coconut water-treated samples showing the lowest values. Thus, coconut water is a promising natural solution for inhibiting browning and preserving the quality of fresh-cut green banana slices during storage."

      "abstract": "Lemon is a fruit rich in antioxidant properties and has several health benefits, namely the reduction of skin edema and anticarcinogenic properties, which are due to its high content of bioactive compounds. Melatonin can improve and preserve the properties of lemon for longer and also has health benefits. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of oral administration of lemon juice after melatonin treatment on murinometric parameters of wild-type (WT) mice and transgenic mice carrying human papillomavirus (HPV). Two trials were performed for oral administration of the lemon extract compound: in drinking water and in diet. First of all, lemons were treated by immersion with melatonin at 10 mM. Then, lemons were squeezed, and the juice obtained was freeze-dried and stored to be subsequently added to drinking water or diet, according to the assay. Thus, mice were divided into eight groups in the drink assay (each with n = 5): group 1 (G1, WT, control), group 2 (G2, WT, 1 mL lemon), group 3 (G3, WT, 1.5 mL lemon), group 4 (G4, WT, 2 mL lemon), group 5 (G5, HPV16, control), group 6 (G6, HPV16, 1 mL lemon) group 7 (G6, HPV16, 1.5 mL lemon) and group 8 (G6, HPV16, 2 mL lemon). The diet assay was divided into four groups: group 1 (G1, WT, control), group 2 (G2, WT, 4 mL lemon), group 3 (G3, HPV16, control) and group 4 (G4, HPV16, 4 mL lemon). In the drink assay, the highest concentration of melatonin (308 ng/100 mL) was for groups 4 and 8, while in the food assay, there was only one concentration of melatonin (9.96 ng/g) for groups 2 and 4. Both trials lasted 30 days. During this time, body weight, food and water were recorded. Afterward, they were sacrificed, and samples were collected for different analyses. At the concentrations used, the lemon juice with melatonin had no adverse effects on the animals' health and showed a positive outcome in modifying weight gain and enhancing antioxidant activity in mice. Moreover, a reduction in the incidence of histological lesions was observed in treated animals. Further research is needed to better understand the effects of lemon extract on health and treatment outcomes in this animal model."

      "abstract": "Aging and obesity make humans more prone to cardiovascular and metabolic syndrome diseases, leading to several serious health conditions, including hyperlipidemia, high blood pressure, and sleep disturbance. This study aimed to explore the hypolipidemic effect of fermented citrus lemon juice using a hyperlipidemic hamster model. The sugar-free lemon juice's fermentation was optimized, and the characteristics of fresh and fermented lemon juice (FLJ) were evaluated and compared, which contained polyphenols and superoxide dismutase-like activity. Results showed that the absorption and utilization efficiency of FLJ was higher compared with the unfermented lemon juice. This study's prefermentation efficiency evaluation found that 21-30 days of bacterial DMS32004 and DMS32005 fermentation of fresh lemon juice provided the best fermentation benefits, and 21-day FLJ was applied as a remedy after the efficiency compassion. After six weeks of feeding, the total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) values in the blood and liver of the FLJ treatment groups were decreased compared with the high-fat diet (HFD) group. In addition, the blood low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were significantly reduced in the FLJ treatment groups compared with the HFD group. In contrast, the blood high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) to LDL-C ratio increased considerably in the FLJ treatment groups, and the total to HDL ratio was significantly lower than in the HFD group. Compared with the HFD group, the TC content in the FLJ treatment groups' feces increased significantly. This study demonstrated that the sugar-free fermentation method and fermentation cycle management provided FLJ with the potential to regulate blood lipids. Further research and verification will be carried out to isolate specific substances from the FLJ and identify their mechanisms of action.",

      "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of apple juice for the marinating of poultry meat and its effect on the technological as well as sensory characteristics and microbiological safety of the raw product after heat treatment. Broiler chicken breast muscles were marinated for 12 h in apple juice (n = 30), a mixture of apple and lemon juice (n = 30) and compared with those in lemon juice (n = 30). The control group (n = 30) consisted of unmarinated breast muscles. Following the evaluation of the technological parameters (pH, L*, a*, b* colour, cutting force, cooking losses) quantitative and qualitative microbiological evaluations were performed on the raw and roasted products. The microbiological parameters were determined as total Mesophilic aerobic microorganisms, Enterobacteriaceae family, and Pseudomonas count. The bacterial identification was performed using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The marinating resulted in lower pH value, but increased tenderness of raw and roasted products. Marinating chicken meat in both apple and lemon juices, including their mixtures and in the control sample, resulted in increased yellow saturation (b*). The highest flavour desirability and overall desirability were obtained in products marinated using a mixture of apple and lemon juice, while the most desirable aroma was obtained from products marinated with apple juice. A significant antimicrobial effect was observed in marinated meat products compared to unmarinated, irrespective of the type of marinade used. The lowest microbial reduction was observed in the roasted products. Apple juice can be used as a meat marinade because it promotes interesting sensory properties and improves the microbiological stability of poultry meat while maintaining the product's good technological characteristics. It makes a good combination with the addition of lemon juice.",

      "abstract": "Bismuth nanoparticles have gained considerable interest in catalysis because of their small size, large surface-to-volume ratio, and low toxicity. In spite of these advantages, the toxic reagents and solvents used in the synthetic process are significant limitations to their development and utilization. In this study, a green approach employing easily accessible lemon juice was applied for the synthesis of bismuth nanoparticles (BiNPs) as a green alternative to conventional chemical ones. This study clarified the formation and growing process of green-synthesized BiNPs using lemon juice as a reducing and capping agent. The reaction time and amounts of lemon juice significantly affect the growth, morphology, and stability of BiNPs, as confirmed from XRD, DLS, SEM, and TEM analyses. The synthesized BiNPs effectively catalyzed the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol in the presence of NaBH4, and the reduction was significantly accelerated by sunlight and the removal of the fibrous coating layer around BiNPs. Moreover, the synthesized BiNPs also show excellent catalytic efficacy toward the reduction of organic dyes, namely, methyl orange, methylene blue, and rhodamine B. All catalytic reductions followed the pseudo-first-order kinetics, and the rate constants are in the order of k MB > k RhB > k MO > k 4-NP. The stated biogenic synthetic route paves the way for the green industrial fabrication of BiNPs and their uses in catalysis for wastewater treatment."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Numerous studies, including our previous work with lemon juice, have reported that low-pH meals reduce the glycemic response to starchy foods. However, the underlying mechanism is not yet understood. Tea, for its polyphenol content, has also been investigated. The main objective of this research was to concurrently study gastric emptying, appetite perceptions and glycemic responses to bread consumed with water, tea, or lemon juice. METHODS: In this randomized, crossover intervention, ten participants consumed equal portions of bread (100 g) with 250 mL of water, water-diluted lemon juice, or black tea at breakfast. Gastric volumes, blood glucose concentrations and appetite perceptions were alternately assessed over 180 min using magnetic resonance imaging, the finger-prick method and visual analogue scales, respectively. RESULTS: Compared to water, lemon juice led to a 1.5 fold increase of the volume of gastric contents, 30 min after the meal (454.0 ± 18.6 vs. 298.4 ± 19.5 mL, [Formula: see text]  ± SEM P < 0.00001). Gastric emptying was also 1.5 times faster (P < 0.01). Conversely, lemon juice elicited a lower glycemic response than water (blood glucose concentrations at t = 55 min were 35% lower, P = 0.039). Tea had no effect. Changes in appetite perceptions and gastric volumes correlated well, but with no significant differences between the meals. CONCLUSIONS: Lemon juice lowered the glycemic response and increased both gastric secretions and emptying rate. The results are compatible with the hypothesis that the reduction of the glycemic response is mainly due to the interruption of starch hydrolysis via the acid-inhibition of salivary α-amylase.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Standard diet with normal calcium and reduced animal proteins and salt content reduces stone recurrence in calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. Whether lemon juice supplementation further reduces recurrence rate is unknown. METHODS: In this single-centre, prospective, randomised, open, blinded endpoint trial (Clinical Trials gov NCT01217372) we evaluated the effects of fresh lemon juice supplementation (60 mL twice daily) versus no supplementation, on time to stone recurrence in 203 patients with recurrent idiopathic calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis who were all prescribed a standard diet. Patients were included between July 2009 and March 2017 at the Nephrology Unit of the Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital in Bergamo, Italy. Time to stone recurrence at 2 years of follow-up was the primary outcome. Analyses were by intention-to-treat. FINDINGS: During two years of follow-up 21 of 100 patients randomised to lemon juice supplementation and 32 of 103 controls randomised to no supplementation had stone recurrence [HR (95% CI): 0·62 (0·35-1·07), p = 0·089]. Patient adherence to lemon juice supplementation, however, progressively decreased from 68% at one-year to 48% at two-year follow-up. At explorative analyses restricted at one-year follow-up, ten patients with supplementation versus 22 controls had stone recurrence [0·43 (0·20-0·89), p = 0·028]. After adjustment by age, sex and normo or hypocitraturia, the HR (95%) was still significant [0·45 (0·20-0·93), p = 0·036]. At six months, 24 hour urinary sodium excretion decreased by 8·60±65·68 mEq/24 h in patients receiving lemon juice supplementation and increased by 3·88±64·78 mEq/24 h in controls. Changes significantly differed between groups (p = 0·031). This difference was subsequently lost. Treatment was safe. In patients with lemon juice supplementation gastrointestinal disorders were more frequent (p<0·001). Renal and urinary tract disorders were similar between groups (p = 0·103). INTERPRETATION: Explorative analyses suggest that fresh lemon juice supplementation to standard diet might prevent stone recurrence in patients with calcium-oxalate nephrolithiasis. However, treatment effect was likely reduced by progressively declining adherence to lemon juice supplementation. FUNDING: This study received no funding."

The results showed that the total aerobic bacteria (TAB) counts in the HHP-, US-, and HT-treated juice blends were less than 2 log10 CFU/mL, the yeast and mold (Y & M) counts were less than 1.3 log10 CFU/mL, and the coliforms most probable number (MPN/100 mL) was less than 3 after 10 days at 4 °C. Anthocyanins were maintained by HHP, but decreased by 16% and 12% after US and HT, respectively. Total phenols increased by 18% and 7% after HHP and US, respectively, while they were maintained by the HT. Furthermore, better maintenance of total phenols, total anthocyanins, ascorbic acid, antioxidant capacity, color, and sensory values were observed in the HHP-treated juice blend stored for 10 days at 4 °C, compared to both the US- and HT-treated samples. Therefore, HHP was proposed to be a better processing technology for juice blend."

However, low bioavailability of catechins limits their therapeutic potential. Lemon juice (LJ) has been suggested to enhance the bioavailability of catechins in vitro. This study investigated the antioxidative and hypolipidemic efficacy of a single dose of green tea extract (GTE) or GTE plus LJ (GTE + LJ) in high-fat diet fed pigs. Sixteen pigs ingested a single dose of GTE (190 mg/kg/day) or GTE + LJ (0.75 mL/kg/day) mixed with low-fat (LF; 5% fat) or high-fat (HF; 22% fat) diets and blood samples were collected for 24 h. Plasma catechin level peaked at two hours, and gradually returned to baseline after six hours following the intake. The addition of LJ significantly increased plasma catechin level. The diet containing GTE did not lower plasma cholesterol and triacylglycerol (TG) concentrations, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activity, or malondialdehyde concentration in 24 h in HF-fed pigs. Addition of a single dose of LJ, however, significantly decreased plasma TG level in LF groups but did not cause further changes on any other markers compared to the GTE alone. Our findings indicate limited effect of a single meal containing GTE on plasma antioxidant enzymes, lipid profile, and lipid peroxidation in pigs and no significant synergistic/additive action of adding LJ to GTE within 24 h in pigs. A study with a longer treatment period is warranted to further understand the potential role of GTE in reducing HF diet-induced oxidative stress and the possible synergistic role of LJ."

In addition, the in vitro antioxidant capacities of lemon juice were determined. The results showed that lemon juice significantly inhibited alcohol-induced increase of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), hepatic TG, and lipid peroxidation levels in a dose-dependent manner. Histopathological changes induced by alcohol were also remarkably improved by lemon juice treatment. These findings suggest that lemon juice has protective effects on alcohol-induced liver injury in mice. The protective effects might be related to the antioxidant capacity of lemon juice because lemon juice showed in vitro antioxidant capacity.",

(1) Received 20 g of garlic daily, plus 1 tablespoon lemon juice, (2) received 20 g garlic daily, (3) received 1 tablespoon of lemon juice daily, and (4) did not receive garlic or lemon juice. A study technician was done the random allocations using a random numbers table. All participants presented 3 days of dietary records and 3 days of physical activity records during 8 weeks. Blood samples were obtained at study baseline and after 8 weeks of intervention. RESULTS: Results showed a significant decrease in total cholesterol (changes from baseline: 40.8 ± 6.1, P < 0.001), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (29.8 ± 2.6, P < 0.001), and fibrinogen (111.4 ± 16.1, P < 0.001) in the Group 1, in comparison with other groups. A greater reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was observed in Group 1 compared with the Groups 3 and 4 (37 ± 10, P = 0.01) (24 ± 1, P = 0.02); respectively. Furthermore, a great reduction in body mass index was observed in the mixed group compared with the lemon juice and control groups (1.6 ± 0.1, P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Administration of garlic plus lemon juice resulted in an improvement in lipid levels, fibrinogen and blood pressure of patients with hyperlipidemia."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Xerostomia is a common clinical problem, and different medications have been tried in its management. In the present study, routine dietary products are used to assess their effect on salivary flow. AIM: To assess the efficacy of yogurt and lemon juice on increase in salivation and its comparison with that of unstimulated saliva. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 40 volunteers (aged 19-48) were selected. The pH of yogurt was calculated, and equivalent pH lemon juice was prepared. First, normal resting saliva was collected as baseline followed by every 1 min for 5 min. Patients were given lemon juice or yogurt and then crossed over to the other group to assess the impact of the stimulants on salivary flow from 1 to 5 min. RESULTS: The results were analyzed statistically. Comparisons between baseline saliva secretion and that by yogurt and lemon juice (using the ANOVA test) showed that there was a significant increase after treatment at the end of the experiment for both yogurt and lemon juice. However, yogurt showed a significant increase in saliva secretion compared to baseline than lemon juice. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that yogurt is a potential candidate for the treatment of dry mouth."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Subdiaphragmatic activity can produce subdiaphragmatic-related artifacts, which can degrade the quality of myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). OBJECTIVES: We examined the impact of drinking milk, water, and lemon juice on different subdiaphragmatic-related artifacts by using (99m)Tc-sestamibi myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in order to determine a feasible method for improving the image quality. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 179 patients (age 58 ± 9.6 years) were enrolled in this study. The patients were randomly divided into five groups. Ten minutes after injection of 740 MBq 99mTc-sestamibi in both pharmacologic stress and rest phases, the individuals in group 1 were given water and milk (125 mL of each); those in group 2 were given lemon juice (250 mL); group 3 was given milk (250 mL); and group 4 was given water (250 mL), whereas no intervention was performed in group 5. The study was double-blind for both subjects and data collectors. MPI was performed for all patients and image quality was controlled by 2 experienced nuclear physicians. Interfering activity was determined visually on reconstructed images and categorized as extracardiac normalization artifact, overlapping of activity, scattering of activity, and ramp filter artifact. RESULTS: There were significant differences in terms of interfering activity among the five groups; group 3 (milk) had significantly lower interfering activity than other groups had, as defined by overlapping of activity (on both stress and rest images), ramp filter artifact (stress images), and scatter artifact (rest images) (P < 0.05). Furthermore, there was a significant difference in the incidence of good-quality images, with no interfering activity in group 3 in the resting state compared with the other groups in the study (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Drinking 250 mL of milk in either the stress phase or the rest phase of imaging diminishes interfering subdiaphragmatic-related artifacts, particularly overlapping of activity in MPI SPECT, resulting in better-quality images."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: When using (99m)Tc sestamibi for myocardial perfusion imaging, increased splanchnic activity creates a problem in the visual and quantitative interpretation of the inferior and infero-septal walls of the left ventricle. We sought to determine whether the administration of diluted lemon juice or full-fat milk would be effective in reducing interfering infra-cardiac activity and therefore result in an improvement in image quality. We compared the administration of full-fat milk and diluted lemon juice to a control group that had no intervention. METHODS: The study was carried out prospectively. All patients referred to our institution for myocardial perfusion imaging from November 2009 to May 2012 were invited to be enrolled in the study. A total of 630 patients were randomised into three groups. Group 0 (G0), 246 patients, were given diluted lemon juice, group 1 (G1), 313 patients, were given full-fat milk, and group 2 (G2), 71 patients, had no intervention (control group). A routine two-day protocol was used and the patients were given the same intervention on both days. Raw data of both the stress and rest images were visually assessed for the presence of infra-cardiac activity, and quantitative grading of the relative intensity of myocardial activity to infra-cardiac activity was determined. The physicians were blinded to the intervention received and the data were reviewed simultaneously. RESULTS: The overall incidence of interfering infra-cardiac activity at stress was 84.1, 84.5 and 96.6% in G0, G1 and G2, respectively (p = 0.005). At rest it was 91.7, 90.1 and 100% in G0, G1 and G2, respectively (p = 0.0063). The visual and quantitative results favoured both milk and lemon juice in reducing the amount of interfering infra-cardiac activity versus no intervention. CONCLUSION: The administration of milk or lemon juice resulted in a significant decrease in the intensity of infra-cardiac activity compared to the control group. This reduction in intensity was even more significant in the milk group for patients assessed during rest myocardial perfusion imaging.",

The present study examined PG radiopharmacokinetics within 2-4 h after radioiodine administration to evaluate whether sialagogues cause a 'rebound effect'. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study was conducted at the Medstar Washington Hospital Center. The study patients had (i) differentiated thyroid cancer, (ii) no history of salivary gland disease or medications affecting the salivary glands, (iii) a clinical salivary scan (SS) with lemon juice (LJ) (SSwLJ) that was performed before I therapy, and (iv) a second SS performed without LJ (SSwoLJ) performed prior to I therapy after giving informed consent. Each PG was assessed for I uptake using time-activity curves (TACs) that were (i) corrected for background and decay, (ii) smoothed using a seven-point unweighted moving average, and (iii) normalized to the administered I activity. TACs of the SSwLJ and SSwoLJ were compared with activity at each time point over 120 min. Areas under the TACs for the PGs were calculated for each gland's SSwLJ and SSwoLJ, and the relative percentage change in potential radiation absorbed dose (PRAD) was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 2100 time points were analyzed in nine patients (18 PGs). I activity in the PGs on SSwLJ exceeded activity seen on the SSwoLJ at 134 time points (6.3%), and 98 (73%) of these were on the basis of spontaneous salivation during SSwoLJ. Mean percentage decrease in relative PRAD was 34.2±17.4% (range, 3.1-66.1%). CONCLUSION: During the time period studied, LJ administration did not result in a 'rebound effect' but resulted in mean relative decrease of 34.2% in PRAD to the PGs.",

      "abstract": "Lemon juice, a major source of acidulant citric acid, is frequently used in the preparation of ethnic foods. Raw or partially cooked meats are marinated with lemon juice in the preparation of a popular Chamorro dish called kelaguen, which is, unfortunately, strongly associated with foodborne illness outbreaks in Guam. We investigated the efficacy of lemon juice in reducing numbers of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Enteritidis, and Listeria monocytogenes at stationary phase during marination. Beef inoculated with a three-strain mixture of E. coli O157:H7, S. Enteritidis, or L. monocytogenes at 10(6)CFU/mL was marinated with lemon juice from 0.2 to 10mL/g for 48h at 28°C. The decline of the pathogens during marination exhibited various degrees of deviation from first-order kinetics. Based on calculations with both linear regression and Weibull models, the decimal reduction time (4-D values) over the range of lemon concentrations was 366-5.1h for E. coli O157:H7, 282-2.4h for S. Enteritidis, and 104-2.4h for L. monocytogenes, indicating that E. coli O157:H7 was the most lemon-juice-resistant of the three. The pathogen reduction time (log 4-D values) plotted against undissociated titratable citric acid exhibited a biphasic pattern. The pathogen reduction time (log 4-D or δ values) was linearly correlated with the pH of the marinating beef (R(2)=0.92 to 0.98). The Z(pH) values (pH dependence of death rate) with beef marination were 1.03 for E. coli O157:H7, 0.92 for S. Enteritidis, and 1.29 for L. monocytogenes, indicating that L. monocytogenes was the most pH resistant of the three. L. monocytogenes exhibited less resistance to lemon juice than S. Enteritidis at pH of 3.5-4.4 but more resistance at pH of 2.6-2.8. In addition, at 4°C, all three pathogens exhibited 4-D values 1.7-4.1 times greater than those at 24°C at 5mL lemon juice/g beef. In conclusion, the usual beef marinating practice for kelaguen preparation (<0.5mL lemon juice/g beef for 1-12h) did not sufficiently inactivate E. coli O157:H7, S. Enteritidis, and L. monocytogenes to meet minimum food-safety requirements. To reduce the risk of kelaguen-associated foodborne illness, kelaguen preparation must include heat treatment in addition to marination with lemon juice.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Chronic hypokalemia is the main finding in patients with Gitelman's syndrome. Exogenous factors can trigger deterioration of the patient's condition and provoke clinical symptoms. We discuss the pathophysiology of and therapy for Gitelman's syndrome, with a focus on dietary factors which may aggravate the disease. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 31-year-old, previously apparently healthy Caucasian Swiss man who presented to our hospital with gait disturbance of subacute onset and a potassium level of 1.5 mmol/L. A detailed medical history revealed that he had been consuming large amounts of licorice (in the form of Fisherman's Friend menthol eucalyptus lozenges). Despite discontinuing the intake of glycyrrhizinic acid, his potassium level remained low. Biochemical investigations showed refractory hypokalemia and secondary hyperaldosteronism, suggestive of Gitelman's syndrome. Despite treatment with supplementation of potassium and magnesium in combination with an aldosterone antagonist, further clinically symptomatic episodes occurred. Triggers could be identified only by repeated detailed history taking. In response to the patient's dietary excesses (ingestion of relevant amounts of alcohol, lemon juice and iced tea), his hypokalemia was aggravated and provoked clinical symptoms. Finally, vomiting and failure to replace salt led to volume depletion and hypokalemic crisis, with a plasma potassium level of 1.0 mmol/L and paralysis with respiratory failure necessitating not only infusion of saline and potassium but also temporary mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: Dietary preferences may have a much larger impact than any drug treatment on the symptoms of this chronic syndrome. Individual (mainly dietary) preferences must be monitored closely, and patients should be given dietary advice to avoid recurrent aggravation of hypokalemia with muscular weakness."

Further, during 9 months storage, the powders suffered slight loss of acidity, and increase in reducing sugars i.e. glucose and fructose and considerable loss (31-55%) in vitamin C contents. Storage conditions did not bring about any significant change in the ash and hesperidin content of the product. But some losses were registered in the total phenols (23.69%) and sensory quality (from 7.72 to 7.26) of the powders. Further, the powders prepared from cation exchange resin treated juice and those pulverized with cane sugar suffered overall lesser changes in most of the quality parameters during 9 months of storage, thus indicating that, the treatment of lemon juice with cation exchange resin is beneficial for better initial product quality and pulverization of prepared powder with cane sugar is beneficial in reducing the hygroscopicity and retention of quality in a better way."

To evaluate this we measured the radiopharmacokinetics of ¹²³I in the parotid glands (PGs) after its administration of lemon juice (LJ). METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on all patients who had a salivary gland scan performed before ¹³¹I therapy between July 2008 and April 2009 at the Washington Hospital Center. Two hours after ¹²³I was given orally, dynamic scintigraphy was initiated. Five milliliters of LJ was given 5 minutes later. Then, the patient was imaged for 1 hour (phase 1) at which point the sequence was repeated (phase 2). Twenty-three patients were studied. For each PG, the presence or absence of uptake was assessed, and based on background corrected counts, the mean, range, and standard deviation were determined for multiple radiopharmacokinetic parameters such as (i) percent radioiodine washout, (ii) time from LJ administration to re-accumulation of radioiodine to pre-LJ activity, and (iii) percent reduction in radiation absorbed dose to the PGs if LJ had been re-administered at the time the radioiodine activity re-accumulated to the pre-LJ activity. RESULTS: The mean  ± one standard deviation and range for percent washout were 84%  ± 18% (35%-100%) and 83%  ±  21% (37%-100%) in phase 1 and 2, respectively. The times from LJ to re-accumulation of the radioiodine to the pre-LJ activity were 21  ± 10 minutes (4-45 minutes) and 40  ± 14 minutes (12-62 minutes) for phase 1 and 2, respectively. The estimated percent reduction in radiation absorbed dose to the PGs following the first and second administration of LJ was 37%  ± 14% (13%-93%) and 47% ± 16% (21%-97%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The washout of radioiodine from the PGs is rapid but transient. Early repeat administration may result in continued and cumulative reduction of radiation absorbed dose in the PGs.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of lemon juice and lemon grass (Cymbopogon citratus) in the treatment of oral thrush in HIV/AIDS patients when compared with the control group using gentian violet aqueous solution 0.5%. Oral thrush is a frequent complication of HIV infection. In the Moretele Hospice, due to financial constraints, the treatment routinely given to patients with oral thrush is either lemon juice directly into the mouth or a lemon grass infusion made from lemon grass (Cymbopogon citratus) grown and dried at the hospice. These two remedies have been found to be very efficacious therefore are used extensively. Gentian violet, the first line medication for oral thrush in South Africa, is not preferred by the primary health clinic patients due to the visible purple stain which leads them to being stigmatized as HIV-positive. Cymbopogon citratus and Citrus limon have known antifungal properties. METHODS: The study design was a randomised controlled trial. Ninety patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: gentian violet, lemon juice or lemon grass. Inclusion criteria included being HIV-positive with a diagnosis of oral thrush. The study period was 11 days and patients were followed up every second day. International ethical principles were adhered to during the study. RESULTS: Of the 90 patients, 83 completed the study. In the intention-to-treat analysis, none of the p-values were significant therefore the null hypothesis could not be rejected. In the analysis of the participants who actually completed the trial, the lemon juice showed better results than the gentian violet aqueous solution 0.5% in the treatment of oral thrush in an HIV-positive population (p<0.02). The null hypothesis in terms of the lemon grass and gentian violet could also be rejected on the basis of the Chi-square test and the likelihood ratio test (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Though the patient population was small, the use of lemon juice and lemon grass for the treatment of oral candidiasis in an HIV population was validated by the randomised controlled trial.",

      "abstract": "To investigate that lemon juice could be an alternative to potassium citrate in the treatment of urinary calcium stones in patients with hypocitraturia, 30 patients with hypocitraturic urinary calcium stones were enrolled into study. The patients were divided into three groups equally. Exactly 60 mEq/day fresh lemon juice ( approximately 85 cc/day) and potassium citrate (60 mEq/day) were given to the patients of first and second group, respectively. Dietary recommendations were made for the third group. Blood and 24-h urine tests were performed before treatment and repeated 3 months later. The differences between demographic datas of groups were not significant. There was no significant difference between values of blood tests performed before and after treatment in all groups. Statistically significant differences were found between pre- and post-treatment urine values in each group. Although there was no significant difference between pre-treatment citrate levels of the groups. A significant difference was found between post-treatment citrate levels of the groups. There was 2.5-, 3.5- and 0.8-fold increase in urinary citrate level of lemon juice, potassium citrate and dietary recommendation groups, respectively. Urinary calcium level was decreased only in lemon juice and potassium citrate groups after treatment. While there was no significant difference between pre- and post-treatment urinary oxalate levels in all groups, a significant decrease in urinary uric acid levels was determined in all groups. We suggest that lemon juice can be an alternative in the treatment of urinary calcium stones in patients with hypocitraturia. Additionally, dietary recommendations can increase effectiveness of the treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Knowledge of the citric acid content of beverages may be useful in nutrition therapy for calcium urolithiasis, especially among patients with hypocitraturia. Citrate is a naturally-occurring inhibitor of urinary crystallization; achieving therapeutic urinary citrate concentration is one clinical target in the medical management of calcium urolithiasis. When provided as fluids, beverages containing citric acid add to the total volume of urine, reducing its saturation of calcium and other crystals, and may enhance urinary citrate excretion. Information on the citric acid content of fruit juices and commercially-available formulations is not widely known. We evaluated the citric acid concentration of various fruit juices. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The citric acid content of 21 commercially-available juices and juice concentrates and the juice of three types of fruits was analyzed using ion chromatography. RESULTS: Lemon juice and lime juice are rich sources of citric acid, containing 1.44 and 1.38 g/oz, respectively. Lemon and lime juice concentrates contain 1.10 and 1.06 g/oz, respectively. The citric acid content of commercially available lemonade and other juice products varies widely, ranging from 0.03 to 0.22 g/oz. CONCLUSIONS: Lemon and lime juice, both from the fresh fruit and from juice concentrates, provide more citric acid per liter than ready-to-consume grapefruit juice, ready-to-consume orange juice, and orange juice squeezed from the fruit. Ready-to-consume lemonade formulations and those requiring mixing with water contain < or =6 times the citric acid, on an ounce-for-ounce basis, of lemon and lime juice.",

With the modern trend toward more natural preservatives, the use of organic acids can achieve a good microbiological safety in food. In the present study, stuffed mussels were inoculated with Salmonella Typhimurium suspension to provide initial populations of approximately 6 and 3 log CFU/g. After inoculation, samples were treated with fresh lemon juice and lemon dressing for 0, 5, and 15 min, and pathogens were enumerated by using direct plating on brilliant green agar. Treatment of stuffed mussels inoculated at high inoculum level, with lemon juice and lemon dressing for different exposure times caused reduction ranging between 0.25 and 0.56 log CFU/g and 0.5 and 0.69 log CFU/g, respectively, whereas in stuffed-mussel samples inoculated at low level, lemon juice and lemon dressing caused 0.08 to 0.25 log CFU/g and 0.22 to 0.78 log CFU/g reductions, respectively. Results of the study showed that both lemon juice and lemon dressing used as flavoring and acidifying agents for stuffed mussels caused slight decrease in Salmonella Typhimurium as an immediate inhibitor, but this effect increased by time. However, treatment of stuffed mussels with the inhibitors until 15 min is not enough to prevent Salmonella Typhimurium outbreaks related to stuffed mussels.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The use of herbal medicines (medicinal plants or phytotherapy) has recently gained popularity in Europe and the United States. Nevertheless the exact mechanism of the preventive effects of these products is still far to be clearly established, being its knowledge necessary to successfully apply these therapies to avoid stone formation. METHODS: The effect of oral lemon juice administration on calcium oxalate urolithiasis was studied in male Wistar rats. Rats were rendered nephrolithic by providing drinking water containing 0.75% ethylene glycol [v/v] (EG) and 2% ammonium chloride [w/v] (AC) for 10 days. In addition to EG/AC treatment, three groups of rats were also gavage-administered solutions containing 100%, 75% or 50% lemon juice [v/v] (6 microl solution/g body weight). Positive control rats were treated with EG/AC but not lemon juice. Negative control rats were provided with normal drinking water, and were administered normal water by gavage. Each group contained 6 rats. After 10 days, serum samples were collected for analysis, the left kidney was removed and assessed for calcium levels using flame spectroscopy, and the right kidney was sectioned for histopathological analysis using light microscopy. RESULTS: Analysis showed that the rats treated with EG/AC alone had higher amounts of calcium in the kidneys compared to negative control rats. This EG/AC-induced increase in kidney calcium levels was inhibited by the administration of lemon juice. Histology showed that rats treated with EG/AC alone had large deposits of calcium oxalate crystals in all parts of the kidney, and that such deposits were not present in rats also treated with either 100% or 75% lemon juice. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that lemon juice has a protective activity against urolithiasis.",

From January through July 1993, water samples of varying alkalinity and hardness were prepared artificially, and underground and surface water samples were obtained from a number of different rural and urban areas in Argentina's Buenos Aires Province. After measuring the latter samples' hardness and alkalinity, a range of concentrations of lemon juice and other acidifiers were added to each sample, and the resulting pH as well as the samples' ability to destroy V. cholerae were determined. The results show that lemon juice can actively prevent survival of V. cholerae but that such activity is reduced in markedly alkaline water. For example, treatment of underground drinking water, which is characterized as having the greatest degree of alkalinity in our area, will typically destroy V. cholerae if the alkalinity of the water is the equivalent of that produced by 200 mg CaCO3 per liter, if enough lemon juice is added to bring the lemon juice concentration to 2%, and if the lemon juice is allowed to act for 30 minutes. All this points up the need to determine the alkalinity of water from any local source to be treated in the process of assessing the minimum concentration of lemon juice required.",
