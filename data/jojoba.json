      "abstract": "Jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis L.) wax was previously reported to increase cutaneous wound healing, ameliorate acne and psoriasis manifestations, and reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. However, its potential cosmetic properties have not been fully investigated. Thus, the current study aimed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activities of jojoba wax and its impact on the synthesis of extracellular components following topical application. The fatty acid and fatty alcohol profiles of two industrial and two lab-scale cold-press jojoba waxes were analyzed along with total tocopherol and phytosterol content. The dermo-cosmetic effect of all jojoba wax preparations was evaluated ex-vivo, using the human skin organ culture model, which emulates key features of intact tissue. The ability of jojoba wax to reduce secreted levels of key pro-inflammatory cytokines and the safety of the applications in the ex-vivo model were evaluated. In addition, the impact on the synthesis of pro-collagen and hyaluronic acid levels upon treatment was investigated. The results demonstrate that topically applied jojoba wax can reduce LPS-induced secretion of IL-6, IL-8, and TNFα by approx. 30% compared to untreated skin. This effect was enhanced when treatment was combined with low non-toxic levels of Triton X-100, and its efficacy was similar to the anti-inflammatory activity of dexamethasone used as a positive control. In addition, mRNA and protein levels of collagen III and synthesis of hyaluronic acid were markedly increased upon topical application of jojoba. Moreover, the enhanced content of extracellular matrix (ECM) components correlated with the enhanced expression of TGFβ1. Collectively, our results further demonstrate that jojoba can reduce local skin inflammation, and this effect may be increased by emulsifier which increases its bioavailability. In addition, the finding that topical application of jojoba wax enhances the synthesis of pro-collagen and hyaluronic acid and may be beneficial in the treatment of age-related manifestations."

      "abstract": "Although jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) has been cultivated for years, information on its N requirements is limited. A 6-year study of mature jojoba plants grown under field conditions with an intensive management regime evaluated the effect of N application rate on plant nutrient status, growth, and productivity, and nitrate accumulation in the soil. Five levels of N application were tested: 50, 150, 250, 370, and 500 kg N ha-1. Fertilizers were provided throughout the growing season via a subsurface drip irrigation system. Leaf N concentration, in both spring and summer, reflected the level of N applied. A diagnostic leaf (youngest leaf that has reached full size) concentration of 1.3% N was identified as the threshold for N deficiency. Increasing rates of N application resulted in higher P levels in young leaves. Plant K status, as reflected in the leaf analysis, was not affected by N treatment but was strongly affected by fruit load. Vegetative growth was inhibited when only 50 kg N ha-1 was applied. Soil analysis at the end of the fertilization season showed substantial accumulation of nitrate for the two highest application rates. Considering productivity, N costs, and environmental risk, 150 kg N ha-1 is the recommended dosage for intensively grown jojoba. N deficiencies can be identified using leaf analysis, and excess N can be detected via soil sampling toward the end of the growing season. These results and tools will facilitate precise N fertilization in intensive jojoba plantations."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the hepatoprotective activity of jojoba seed cake extracts against an acute paracetamol (PC) intoxication. Two aqueous extracts from jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) seed cake, a simmondsin-rich extract (WE), and a simmondsin-hydrolyzed extract (NE) using Viscozyme L enzyme have been prepared and characterized. After enzyme treatment, simmondsin content decreased from 33.0 % to 3.0 % and glucose content increased from 16.2 % to 27.3 % reflecting simmondsin hydrolysis. Both extracts were administered to different rat groups via gavage (0.6 g/kg b.w.) before PC treatment (2 g/kg b.w.) three times a week for 3 weeks. The PC intoxication altered the serum biomarkers, the oxidative status, and the Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), Bax and Bcl-2 protein expressions of tested animals. In addition, the histological analysis of liver tissues proved significant injury and hepatocellular necrosis. WE and NE extract showed a relatively high in vitro radical scavenging (ORAC) and averting activities (HORAC) with a polyphenol content of 3.6 % and 2.9 %, respectively. Both extracts showed a powerful in vivo hepatoprotective activity against PC-induced toxicity by improving the hepatocellular antioxidant status and blocking proteins expression (TNF-α, Bax and Bcl-2), involved in inflammation and liver damage. However, the enzymatic treatment improved the hepatoprotective activity of NE despite its lower simmondsin content and lower in vitro antioxidant capacity. This enhancement could be linked to the synergetic effect between the antioxidant components and the new hydrolytic products as glucose, uronic acids, arabinose and simmondsin-aglycons. These results suggest that jojoba waste could be potentially valorized in developing hepatoprotective drugs.",

      "abstract": "A unique storage lipid wax found in jojoba seeds can be employed as a chemical feedstock. Alternative safe and natural sources of plant nutrients are constantly sought to preserve both human health and the environment. As a result, EAI1, EAI2, and EAI3 jojoba genotypes' growth, yield, and phytochemical behavior in response to Azolla extract at concentrations of 0, 10, and 30% were studied. Maximum productivity was found with EAI1, followed by EAI3 then EAI2 across all Azolla extracts. In relation to the Azolla extract concentrations in the two seasons, the concentration of 30% delivered the most pronounced results across all the studied genotypes. During the two seasons, administration of a combined treatment of the EAI1 jojoba genotype with 30% Azolla extract produced the highest mean values of growth, flowering, and fruiting, as well as chemical composition parameters. This means that the treatment of EAI1 genotype with 30% Azolla filiculoides Lam. plant extract yielded the highest significant seed yield (3748 and 3839 kg ha-1) and oil yield per hectare (1910 and 2002 L ha-1). The combination treatment of the EAI1 jojoba genotype with 10% Azolla extract yielded the highest proportion of gadoleic fatty acid (49.83%)."

A total of 384 one-day-old Ross-308 were subdivided into four dietary treatments of jojoba seed oil: 0, 50, 100 and 150 mg/kg of control diet. Each treatment group included twelve replicates with eight birds each. The results showed that dietary supplementation of jojoba seed oil linearly increased (p < 0.01) feed intake, body weight gain and improved (p < 0.01) feed conversion ratio. Interestingly, diets supplemented with jojoba seed oil linearly (p < 0.05) improved the percentage of dressing and reduced abdominal fat percentage compared to the control group. Dietary supplementation of jojoba seed oil showed no effects (p ≥ 0.05) on the weight of internal organs, including liver, heart, gizzard, spleen and pancreas of broiler chickens. Increasing jojoba seed oil levels in the diet decreased (p < 0.001) percentages of cook and drip losses of breast and leg (drumstick and thigh) muscles of broilers. It was concluded that jojoba seed oil used as a feed additive up to 150 mg/kg improves growth performance and meat quality of broiler chickens in tropical weather conditions."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Renewed consumer and industry interest in natural ingredients has led to a large growth of natural cosmetics. This has put pressure on formulation skills and product claims when it comes to using natural compounds. Taking a strategic and comprehensive approach in viewing natural ingredients, including natural oils, as 'active' ingredients rather than just providing for so-called 'natural' claims, aids both innovation and development. Given the ever-increasing consumer demand for natural ingredients, and more importantly the demand for effective natural ingredients including plant oils, it is important for the cosmetic industry to re-evaluate them in this context. METHOD: The objectives of this review are to provide an update of three popular cosmetic plant oils - Sweet Almond, Evening Primrose and Jojoba - in terms of their cosmetic applications as 'active' ingredients. This review highlights the activity of these oils, in the management of dry skin, ageing skin, juvenile skin, atopic dermatitis, scalp conditions and their wider potential. Attention is given to formulation considerations where the content of these oils impacts product oxidation, skin penetration and stratum corneum homeostasis. RESULTS: Benefits of these oils have been well documented both pre-clinically and clinically. Historically, they have been used for hundreds if not thousands of years for their management and treatment of various skin and other ailments. Given the discrepancies in some clinical data presented for a variety of dermatoses, the importance of the choice of oil and how to formulate with them within the context of the epidermal barrier function, skin penetration and toxicity cannot be underestimated. Care should be taken in terms of the quality and stability of theses oils, as well as ensuring best formulation type, if the reported activities of these oils are to be achieved with consistency. Despite discrepancies in the literature and questionable study designs, it is clear that Sweet Almond, Evening Primrose and Jojoba oils do have skin care benefits for both adult and juvenile applications. CONCLUSION: They are effective ingredients for skin care preparations to strengthen stratum corneum integrity, recovery and lipid ratio. Nevertheless, further experimental data are required concerning the impact on stratum corneum physiology and structure.",

      "abstract": "Jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis (Link) C.K. Schneid) is a dioecious plant in desert and semi-desert areas, e.g., the Ismailia Desert in Egypt. Jojoba oil (JJBO) is a natural slight yellow oil with the functions of skin barrier repairing and wound healing, which is dermally applied as a traditional medication or cosmetic in the Middle East. The objective of this study was to prepare JJBO dry nanoemulsion powders (JNDs) and investigate their anti-acute lung injury effects. JJBO nanoemulsions (JNEs) were prepared and then lyophilized to JNDs and the properties and simulated lung deposition were measured. Rat acute lung injury (ALI) models were established after intratracheal (i.t.) administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). JNDs and dexamethasone (DXM) solutions were also i.t. administered to the rats. The pathological states of lung tissues were checked. Inflammatory and oxidative factors in the lung tissues were determined using ELISA methods. NF-κB p65 and caspase-3 were measured with a Western blotting method and an immunohistochemical method, respectively. JNDs had an appropriate mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of 4.17 µm and a fine particle fraction (FPF) of 39.11%. JNDs showed higher anti-inflammatory effect on LPS-induced ALI than DXM with a decrease in total protein content and down-regulation of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and NF-κB p65. JNDs also showed higher anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidation effect on H2O2-induced ALI than DXM with elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increasing of superoxide dismutase (SOD), decrease in of lipid peroxide malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH), and inhibition of caspase-3 expression. Moreover, i.t. JNDs attenuated bleeding and infiltrations of the inflammatory cells in the two ALI models. JNDs are a promising natural oil-contained inhalable medication for the treatment of LPS- or H2O2-induced ALI."

      "abstract": "After introducing the idea of using concentrations equal to or less than the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) of some active chemical compounds for evacuating microbial cells, different types of microbes were evacuated. The original protocol was given the name sponge-like protocol and then was reduced and modified from a microorganism to another to prepare microbial ghosts for various applications such as immunological applications, drug delivery, and isolation of DNA and protein. Fungal pathogens that infect plants critically affect cost effectiveness, quality, and quantity of their production. They kill plant cells and/or cause plant stress. Plant fungal infections can originate from many sources such as infected soil, seeds, or crop debris causing diseases and quality losses around the world with billions of US dollars annually as costs of the associated productivity loss. This study focused on the application of the sponge-like protocol in protecting in vitro tissue cultures of plants against fungal pathogens. This can be useful for research purposes or may be developed to be introduced in field applications. Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger infection in tissue culture of jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis (Link) Schn.) was used as a model to establish the employment of this protocol to control plant fungal diseases. The best conditions for A. flavus and A. niger ghosts production previously mapped by randomization experimental design (reduced Plackett-Burman experimental design) were used to prepare fungal ghosts. SDS, NaOH, NaHCO3, and H2O2 were used in their MIC (+1 level) or minimum growth concentration (MGC, -1 level) according to the determined optimal experimental design. The release of both of DNA and protein from the fungal cells was evaluated spectrophotometrically at 260nm and 280nm, respectively, as an indicator for cell loss of their cytoplasm. Fungal ghost cells were also examined by transmission electron microscopy. After confirming the preparation of high-quality fungal ghost cells, the same conditions were mimicked to control plant fungal infection. Jojoba grown in tissue culture was sprayed with fungal cells (about 103 CFU) as a control experiment or fungal cells followed by treatment with solution (a) represents the fungal ghost cells formation calculated critical concentration (FGCCC) of SDS, NaOH, and NaHCO3 and then treatment with solution (b) represents H2O2 FGCCC. The plant was examined on day 0 (plant grown before any infection or infection followed by treatment), day 5 (plant at day 5 after infection or infection followed by treatment), and day 10 (plant at day 10 after infection or infection followed by treatment). We observed fungal growth in case of control experiments at days 5 and 10 on the tissue culture medium, as well as plant, and the absence of any fungal growth in case of plant treated with FGCCC even after day 10. We recommend using this FGCCC in the form of chemical spraying formulation to treat the plants aiming to control different plant fungal infections in in vitro tissue culture systems or applied in field.",

In our study, we investigated the effect of the Tunisian jojoba seed on a metabolic syndrome induced in rat by the High Fat diet and High Fructose (HFHF) and its renal and hepatic complications. METHODS: The rats were fed with HFHF or Normal Diet (ND) for a period of 8 weeks. After that, a switch from HFHF to ND or Normal Diet Jojoba (NDJ),(jojoba diet approach) or High Fat and High Fructose and Jojoba diet (HFHFJ) (nutraceutical approach) has been done. Metabolic disorder was evaluated by measuring the fasting body weight, glycemia and C-peptide and leptin. Oxidative stress parameters like ThioBarbituric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS) and Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAOC) were analyzed in the plasma and renal and hepatic function were determined by the measure of creatinine and alanine transferase (ALT) respectively. Histological analysis was performed on the liver, kidney and pancreas. RESULTS: HFHF diet exhibited characteristics of metabolic syndrome presented by insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, hyperleptinemia, fat mass with hepatic steatosis and renal disorder. HFHF diet was associated with oxidative stress (OS) presented by an increase in TBARS and a decrease in TAOC. Adding jojoba seeds to HFHF rat group diet induced a decrease in body weight, fat mass (58 and 41%), insulin resistance (59 and 56%), oxidative stress (60 and 41%), liver steatosis (from a score = 3 to a score = 0) and renal complications (25 and 42%). This effect was emphasized with diet approach. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated the beneficial effect of jojoba against metabolic syndrome and oxidative stress, suggesting that jojoba could be used in the prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome."

However, limited information is available regarding their effects on blood biochemical parameters. This study aimed to investigate the effect of transdermal administration of jojoba oil on blood biochemical parameters in mice. Materials and Methods: Eight-week-old male hairless mice were randomly divided into naïve control and treatment groups. In the treatment group, mice were topically administered 4 μL of jojoba oil, per gram of body weight, on the dorsa 30 min before euthanasia. Thereafter, serum biochemical parameters were assayed, and gene expression was analyzed in various tissues via a real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: Serum non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels increased significantly 30 min after topical application of jojoba oil (p < 0.05). Atgl was significantly upregulated in the liver (p < 0.05), and Atgl upregulation in the liver was positively correlated with serum NEFA levels (r = 0.592, p < 0.05). Furthermore, a trend of decreasing fatty acid trafficking-related gene (FABPpm, FATP-1, FATP-3, and FATP-4) expression in the skin after topical application of jojoba oil (p = 0.067, 0.074, 0.076, and 0.082, respectively) was observed. Conclusions: Serum NEFA levels were elevated 30 min after transdermal administration of jojoba oil. The mechanisms of elevated serum NEFA levels might be related to both enhanced lipolysis in the liver and reduced fatty acid trafficking in the skin.",

PIPs play an important role throughout plant development, and in response to abiotic stresses. Jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis (Link) Schneider), as a typical desert plant, tolerates drought, salinity and nutrient-poor soils. In this study, a PIP1 gene (ScPIP1) was cloned from jojoba and overexpressed in Arabidopsis thaliana. The expression of ScPIP1 at the transcriptional level was induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatment. ScPIP1 overexpressed Arabidopsis plants exhibited higher germination rates, longer roots and higher survival rates compared to the wild-type plants under drought and salt stresses. The results of malonaldehyde (MDA), ion leakage (IL) and proline content measurements indicated that the improved drought and salt tolerance conferred by ScPIP1 was correlated with decreased membrane damage and improved osmotic adjustment.

The present study was conducted to stimulate embryogenic calli formation from jojoba using zeatin and thidiazuron (TDZ), as well as determination of the antioxidant activity of proliferated calli. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For callus induction, leaf and stem explants derived from in vitro grown shootlets, were cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with different combinations of 0.5 mg L-1 benzyl adenine (BA) or kinetin with 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), Naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) and picloram at 0.5 or 1mg L-1. To stimulate embryogenic calli, friable callus were transferred to woody plant medium (WPM) supplemented with different concentrations of zeatin or TDZ. Antioxidant activity of different treatments was determined using hexane or petroleum ether extraction. Data was analyzed as mean±standard deviation (SD). RESULTS: The MS medium supplemented with 0.5 mg L-1 BA+0.5 or 1 mg L-1 picloram was the best treatment to obtain friable calli from both explants types. WPM medium supplemented with 2 mg L-1 zeatin gave the highest percentage of embryogenic calli derived from leaf explants. While the highest percentage of embryogenic calli derived from stem explants was registered using 1 or 4 mg L-1 TDZ containing medium. Embryogenic calli originated from leaves explants on 1.5 mg L-1 zeatin showed promising activity of antioxidant with hexane extraction. However, embryogenic calli originated from stem explants on 1 mg L-1 TDZ showed the highest antioxidant activity with petroleum ether extraction. CONCLUSION: TDZ has promising effect on embryogenic callus induction from stem explants. While, zeatin has promising effect on embryogenic callus induction from leaf explants.",

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease in which topical delivery of antipsoriatic agents is considered the first line treatment. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the encapsulation of the synthetic retinoid tazarotene in a nanocarrier based on jojoba oil would decrease its irritation potential and clinically improve its therapeutic outcome in psoriatic patients. METHOD: A microemulsion system based on jojoba wax and labrasol/plurol isostearique was prepared and characterized. RESULTS: The selected formula displayed spherical morphology, particle size of 15.49±2.41 nm, polydispersity index of 0.20 ±0.08, negative charge and low viscosity. The microemulsion provided two folds increase in skin deposition of tazarotene, correlating with higher reduction in psoriatic patients PASI scores after treatment (68% reduction in PASI scores versus 8.96% reduction with the marketed gel). No irritation was encountered in patients using microemulsion, with redness and inflammation reported with the marketed gel-treated patients. CONCLUSION: Jojoba oil microemulsion proved to be advantageous in reducing the irritancy of tazarotene, enhancing its skin deposition and achieving better therapeutic outcome in psoriatic patients.",

Jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) is a long-lived, drought resistant, perennial plant with interesting economic value as it is processed for liquid wax production. The jojoba plant produces esters of long-chain alcohols and fatty acids (waxes) as a seed lipid energy reserve. The liquid wax is an important substrate for a variety of industrial applications and is used in skin treatment preparations. The oil from the jojoba plant is the main biological source of wax esters and has a multitude of potential applications. The review of literatures suggest that jojoba has anti-inflammatory effect and it can be used on a variety of skin conditions including skin infections, skin aging, as well as wound healing. Moreover, jojoba has been shown to play a role in cosmetics formulas such as sunscreens and moisturizers and also enhances the absorption of topical drugs.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: External application of clay facial masks is a cosmetic procedure generally used to reduce skin lesions and to improve overall skin condition. OBJECTIVE: Collecting pilot data about self-treatment with clay jojoba oil masks on participants with acne-prone, lesioned skin and acne. METHODS: Open, prospective, observational pilot study: Participants received written information, instructions, and questionnaires without direct contact with the study physician. For 6 weeks, they applied the masks 2-3 times per week. The primary outcome is the difference of skin lesions: baseline vs. after 6 weeks. RESULTS: 194 participants (192 female, 2 male, mean age (± SE) (32.3 ± 0.7 years) returned questionnaires and diaries. 133 of these participants returned complete and precise lesion counts (per-protocol (PP) collective). A 54% mean reduction in total lesion count was observed after 6 weeks of treatment with clay facial mask. Both inflammatory and non-inflammatory skin lesions were reduced significantly after treatment compared to baseline: Median counts (MC) of pustules per affected participant were reduced from 7.0 ± 0.9 to 3.0 ± 0.5 (mean individual reduction (MIR) = 49.4%), the MC of the papules from 3.5 ± 2.2 to 1.0 ± 0.4 (MIR = 57.3%), the MC of cysts from 2.0 ± 0.8 to 0.5 ± 0.4 (MIR = 68.6%) and the MC of comedones from 26.5 ± 6.3 to 16.0 ± 4.0 (MIR = 39.1%). DLQI-average score decreased from 5.0 ± 4.5 (mean ± SE) before to 2.1 ± 2.8 after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The present study gives preliminary evidence that healing clay jojoba oil facial masks can be effective treatment for lesioned skin and mild acne vulgaris.",

The prepared emulgels were physically evaluated for their stability after temperature cycle test, centrifugation and long-term shelf storage for 1 year at room temperature. The in vitro release at 37 °C was studied to define the effect of the concentration and type of the gelling agent. A comparison between the formulated emulgels and two commercially available products, Candistan® and Canesten® creams, was carried out to judge their efficacy and stability. The prepared emulgels exhibited non-Newtonian shear thinning behavior with little or no thixotropy. Four emulgels showed excellent stability as they demonstrated consistent rheological model under different treatment conditions. The in vitro release test showed variation in the extent of percent drug released. The drug release from the commercial preparation was lower than some of the prepared emulgel formulae. One formula containing combination of the two gelling agents (HPMC and Carbopol 934 P), showed excellent stability and high extent of clotrimazole release was microbiologically evaluated against Candida albicans using cylinder and plate method. The selected formula showed superior antimycotic activity compared to the commercially available formulation. Further in vivo animal studies for the obtained stable formula is recommended.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: JLW cytotoxicity was evaluated by the crystal violet staining and the neutral red uptake endpoint. Induction of wound healing by JLW was assessed by scratch wound assay on cell monolayers. The involvement of signaling pathways was evaluated by the use of the Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA and of kinase inhibitors, and by Western blot analysis of cell lysates using anti-phospho antibodies. Collagen and gelatinase secretion by cells were assayed by in-cell ELISA and zymography analysis, respectively. RESULTS: Cytotoxicity assays showed that the toxic effects of JLW to these cells are extremely low. Scratch wound experiments showed that JLW notably accelerates the wound closure of both keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The use of inhibitors and Western blot revealed that the mechanism of action of JLW is strictly Ca(2+) dependent and requires the involvement of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway and of the p38 and ERK1/2 MAPKs. In addition, JLW was found to stimulate collagen I synthesis in fibroblasts, while no effect was detected on the secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9 gelatinases by HaCaT or fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, data provide a pharmacological characterization of JLW properties on skin cells and suggest that it could be used in the treatment of wounds in clinical settings.",

SDS-PAGE showed two major proteins at 50 kDa and 25 kDa both in the albumins and in the globulins. The 25 kDa protein has trypsin- and chymotrypsin-inhibitory activities. In vitro digestibility of the globulins and albumins resembled that of casein and soybean protein concentrates and was increased after heat treatment.

A first experiment, using graded levels of JO supplementation (0 to 12%), was conducted to establish appropriate JO supplementation. Adequate reduction of growth rate was obtained with 4% JO supplementation. However, notwithstanding their similar growth rate, 4% JO chickens consumed considerably more feed compared with feed-restricted chickens. The dose-dependent impairment of feed intake with increasing levels of JO supplementation was also associated with increased plasma growth hormone and thyroxine and with decreased plasma insulin-like growth factor-I and triiodothyronine concentrations compared with 0% JO chickens. A second experiment included a pair-fed group. Notwithstanding their similar feed intake, 4% JO chickens gained significantly less body weight compared with their pair-fed counterparts. The 4% JO chickens also had a longer feed transit time per kilogram body weight. Again, circulating levels of the somatotrophic and thyrotrophic hormones were altered according to the dietary treatment. From all these observations, it was concluded that the growth retardation caused by JO supplementation was provoked by an inhibition of appetite linked with the simmondsin content of JO as well as by other antinutritional compounds affecting digestibility.",

      "abstract": "Jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis [Link] Schneider) is an important crop in desert climates. A relatively high frequency of periods of chilling and high photon flux density (PFD) in this environment makes photoinhibition likely, resulting in a reduction of assimilation capacity in overwintering leaves. This could explain the low net photosynthesis found in shoots from the field (4-6 micromoles per square meter per second) when compared to greenhouse grown plants (12-15 micromoles per square meter per second). The responses of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance to changes in absorbed PFD and in substomatal partial pressure of CO(2) were measured on jojoba leaves recovering from chilling temperature (4 degrees C) in high or low PFD. No measurable gas exchange was found immediately after chilling in either high or low PFD. For leaves chilled in low PFD, the original quantum yield was restored after 24 hours. The time course of recovery from chilling in high PFD was much longer. Quantum yield recovered to 60% of its original value in 72 hours but failed to recover fully after 1 week. Measurements of PSII chlorophyll fluorescence at 77 K showed that the reduced quantum yield was caused by photoinhibition. The ratio of variable to maximal fluorescence fell from a control level of 0.82 to 0.41 after the photoinhibitory treatment and recovery was slow. We also found a large increase in net assimilation rate and little closure of stomata as CO(2) was increased from ambient partial pressure of 35 to 85 pascals. For plants grown in full light, the increase in net assimilation rate was 100%. The photosynthetic response at high CO(2) concentration may constitute an ecological advantage of jojoba as a crop in the future."

      "abstract": "The influence of jojoba oil (JO) incorporation in the diet on stomach emptying and intestinal transit time, and the digestion and absorption of JO were investigated in short-term feeding studies in rats. The animals were fed purified diets containing 18% (w/w) fat, of which half consisted of a mixture of lard and sunflower seed oil (SF) supplemented with an equivalent amount of JO. The control animals were fed a mixture of lard and SF (18%). No treatment-related differences were observed in the rate of stomach emptying or the intestinal transit time. Comparative lipid analysis of lymph, intestinal content, intestinal mucosa and faeces indicated that most of the ingested JO was degraded and absorbed. Part of the JO was present as wax ester in the lymph. Hydrolysis of JO was much slower than that of triacylglycerols and continued in the alimentary tract beyond the small intestine due to bacterial processes. JO did not influence the absorption of the conventional fat.",

      "abstract": "The liquid wax obtained from the seeds of the arid-land shrub jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) is finding increasing use in skin treatment preparations. The fate of this wax upon reaching the digestive tract was studied. 14C-Labeled wax was administered intragastrically to mice, and the distribution of the label in the body was determined as a function of time. Most of the wax was excreted, but a small amount was absorbed, as was indicated by the distribution of label in the internal organs and the epididymal fat. The label was incorporated into the body lipids and was found to diminish with time.",
