      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The standard treatment for acute empyema/complicated parapneumonic effusion (CPPE) is antibiotic administration and continuous chest drainage. However, adequate drainage becomes impossible in multichambered pleural effusion and some patients may require surgery or may die. In Japan, intrapleural urokinase is frequently used to restore drainage effects; however, its supply was suspended in 2022 owing to difficulties in procuring the raw materials. In recent years, the effectiveness of intrapleural sodium bicarbonate administration for empyema/CPPE has been reported; however, complications such as hemothorax and pneumothorax occurred frequently because the research protocol involved repeated thoracentesis. Therefore, we designed an interventional study to investigate the efficacy and safety of intrapleural sodium bicarbonate administration combined with continuous chest drainage in patients with empyema/CPPE. METHODS: This study will include patients with empyema/CPPE who have been administered antibiotics and still have pleural effusion after > 12 h of continuous chest drainage. Sodium bicarbonate (50 mL) will be administered into the pleural cavity through the double-lumen catheter of the chest tube once daily for a maximum of 3 days. The primary endpoint will be treatment success rate, defined as the rate of avoiding surgery or death within 30 days of sodium bicarbonate administration. The 95% confidence interval for the treatment success rate will be calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method. DISCUSSION: Sodium bicarbonate can be chemically synthesized; therefore, there is little concern about supply shortages and it is inexpensive. Therefore, if it is effective against empyema/CPPE, it would prove beneficial for Japan and other countries. Once this study shows the efficacy and safety of intrapleural sodium bicarbonate administration for empyema/CPPE, we plan to conduct a prospective randomized controlled trial using a placebo. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was approved by the Yokohama City University Clinical Research Review Committee (ethics approval number: CRB24-001) on May 8, 2024, and registered with the Japan Clinical Trials Registry (jRCTs031240093) on May 17, 2024. Written informed consent will be obtained from the participants or their proxies.",

We hypothesized that administration of SB within the first 5 minutes of p-IHCA would be associated with greater odds of hospital survival and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Quaternary care academic children's hospital. PATIENTS: Children 18 years old or younger with pulseless IHCA of at least 5 minutes duration at our institution between January 2013 and January 2023 with complete data were included. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 243 index events of p-IHCA, 99 (41%) received SB in the first 5 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Overall, 107 patients (44%) survived to hospital discharge and ROSC was achieved in 91 of 243 patients (37%). A logistic treatment-effects estimation utilizing inverse-probability weighting via a propensity score was performed to compare the effects of SB use within the first 5 minutes of CPR with those who did not receive early SB. In this analysis, we failed to detect an association between early SB, compared with not, and differing adjusted odds of survival to discharge (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0.45-1.69; p = 0.687) and ROSC (aOR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.43-1.56; p = 0.537). CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective cohort study of p-IHCA, we failed to detect an association between timing of SB and odds of survival to hospital discharge and ROSC. These findings warrant reevaluation of the evidence and support a less restrictive recommendation for SB use during p-IHCA in U.S. national guidelines."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute lamotrigine (LTG) overdose can cause refractory cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, altered mental status, and seizures. Here, we present the case of a patient admitted for massive LTG intoxication refractory to sodium bicarbonate treatment, which improved with lipid rescue therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Serum concentrations of therapeutic drugs were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed the LTG level of 63 mg/L. The other quantified drugs were propranolol (441 ng/mL), methylphenidate (0.7 ng/mL), and ritalinic acid (140 ng/mL). The patient developed nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, widening of the QRS complex (up to 160 milliseconds), and unresponsive coma (Glasgow Coma Scale score of 5). The patient was treated with repeated doses of 1 M sodium bicarbonate and other supportive measures. On the fourth day, because of neurological and cardiac refractoriness, a dose of intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) was administered, resulting in significant improvement in the patient's neurological condition and narrowing of the QRS interval on electrocardiography. The serum LTG concentration was closely monitored over 8 days. The LTG concentration peaked at 127 mg/L from an initial concentration of 63 mg/L, with a half-life (t1/2) of 48.5 hours before ILE administration and 10.5 hours after its administration, determined using a first-order kinetic process. On day 15, the patient was discharged from the intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS: The use of ILE as a rescue option, in addition to other supportive measures, and therapeutic drug monitoring seem to be a reasonable approach, given the patient's refractory response to sodium bicarbonate. Continued research and reporting of such cases will help expand the evidence base and refine management strategies for severe LTG intoxication."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Kidney dysfunction and reduced filtration capacity due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) lead to a shift in the body's acid-base balance, ultimately causing metabolic acidosis (MA). Sodium bicarbonate has been used as a supplement to alleviate the symptoms and reverse the acidosis, and it may even slow the progression of CKD. However, its safety profile and overall effectiveness are uncertain. AIM: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials assessing sodium bicarbonate's safety and efficacy for treating CKD-induced MA. METHODS: Medline, Scopus, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central were systematically searched from inception until May 2024 to select all relevant randomized control trials (RCTs) and non-RCT (NRCTs) evaluating the effectiveness of sodium bicarbonate in correcting MA in end-stage renal disease patients. In addition, ClinicalTrials.gov, Medrxiv.org, and Google Scholar were searched for other literature. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed to derive mean differences (MD) and risk ratios (RR) with their 95%CI for continuous and dichotomous outcomes respectively. RESULTS: Following a systematic search of the databases, 20 RCTs and 2 and NRCTs comprising 2932 patients were included in our study. The results revealed that sodium bicarbonate significantly increased serum bicarbonate in CKD patients (MD: 2.59, 95%CI: 0.95-4.22; P = 0.02; I 2 = 95%). However, there was a non-significant increase in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients on sodium bicarbonate therapy (MD: 0.93, 95%CI: -1.88-3.75; P = 0.52; I 2 = 93%). Upon assessment of the safety profile of sodium bicarbonate, no significant association was found in the outcomes of death/prolonged hospitalization (RR: 1.05, 95%CI: 0.84-1.32; P = 0.66; I 2 = 0%), or gastrointestinal disorders (RR: 1.64, 95%CI: 0.35-7.66; P = 0.53; I 2 = 76%), or worsening edema (RR: 1.26, 95%CI: 0.94-1.68; P = 0.12; I 2 = 37%) when compared to control. CONCLUSION: Sodium bicarbonate therapy may halt worsening kidney function by correcting serum bicarbonate levels and treating MA. Although sodium bicarbonate does not significantly improve the eGFR, it may potentially prevent CKD progression while maintaining an overall favorable safety profile."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The optimal strategy for correcting metabolic acidosis and maintaining acid-base balance in hemodialysis patients remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the effects of oral bicarbonate administration vs. increased dialysate bicarbonate concentration on predialysis serum bicarbonate levels in hemodialysis patients with metabolic acidosis. METHODS: This was a single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial. Adult hemodialysis patients with metabolic acidosis (serum bicarbonate < 22 mmol/L) were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three treatment groups for 16 weeks: (1) standard dialysate (32 mM bicarbonate plus 3 mM acetate), (2) increased dialysate bicarbonate (34 mM bicarbonate plus 3 mM acetate), or (3) standard dialysate with daily oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation (0.3-0.5 mmol/kg). Of the 75 eligible participants, 66 completed the study. The primary outcome was the difference in predialysis serum bicarbonate levels between the groups at 16 weeks. RESULTS: Baseline predialysis serum bicarbonate levels averaged approximately 19.5 mmol/L across all three groups. At 16 weeks, there was no statistically significant difference in predialysis serum bicarbonate levels among the groups (p = 0.701). The mean levels were 20.1 (SD 2.16) mmol/L in the standard dialysate group, 20.5 (SD 2.04) mmol/L in the increased dialysate bicarbonate group, and 20.8 (SD 2.61) mmol/L in the oral supplementation group. Compared to baseline, predialysis bicarbonate levels significantly increased within the increased dialysate bicarbonate group (p = 0.010) and the oral supplementation group (p = 0.021), but not in the control (standard dialysate, no oral supplementation) group. CONCLUSION: Oral or dialytic bicarbonate supplementation at the doses used in this study demonstrated equivalent effects on predialysis serum bicarbonate concentrations in acidotic hemodialysis patients. However, the amount of supplemental bicarbonate administered via either route was insufficient to achieve the target correction of acidosis (e.g., predialysis serum bicarbonate ≥ 22 mmol/L)."

Thirty-six lactating multiparous Holstein cows were used with a milk yield average of 39 kg/d and 64 d in milk. The experiment was conducted over 60 d using two groups: control (CON; n = 18) was supplemented with sodium bicarbonate at 1.1% dry matter and a treatment group that received Lithothamnium calcareum at 0.5% of dry matter (LITHO; n = 18). Each group was fed daily with the buffers mixed to the total mixed ration containing 29.28% starch. Ruminal fluid collections were performed weekly to evaluate pH and volatile fatty acids. Feeding behaviour data were obtained through automatic feeders, while overall behavioural data were obtained using monitoring collars. Milk yield was recorded daily and adjusted for fat and energy. Milk samples were retrieved once weekly for analysis of fat, protein, lactose and total solids. Blood samples were collected weekly for metabolic analysis and faecal samples were collected weekly to evaluate pH and starch concentrations. LITHO produced more fat- and energy-corrected milk (P ≤ 0.01) as well as the highest percentage of fat and solids (P < 0.05) when compared to the CON group. Data on feeding behaviour showed an increased eating time (P ≤ 0.01) in the LITHO group but a higher eating rate (P < 0.01) in the CON group. Animals from the LITHO group had lower faecal pH (P < 0.05). The treatment did not affect dry matter intake, animal behaviour, ruminal acid-base balance, or faecal starch. In summary, Lithothamnium calcareum supplementation at 0.5% of dry matter improved milk yield, milk composition and, presumably, feed conversion efficiency."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Presently, more than one in four births in high-income countries undergo labour induction. Induction of labour is an independent risk factor for adverse obstetric outcomes, including high rates of operative delivery. Two drugs, hyoscine butylbromide and sodium bicarbonate, have been used in labour to facilitate cervical dilation and prevent uterine lactate accumulation. However, no previous randomised trial has systematically studied the separate and combined effects of these drugs in women with induction of labour. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Safe Induction of Labour Trial (SAINT) study will assess the efficacy of oral sodium bicarbonate and intravenous hyoscine butylbromide on facilitating spontaneous (ie, non-operative) delivery in nulliparous participants with induction of labour. We present a 2×2 factorial design where three active treatment arms are compared with double-placebo. Participants are recruited at 10 delivery departments across Norway. Treatment will start on diagnosis of established labour with a maximum of three consecutive doses 4 hours apart. Approximately 5100 women will be screened to achieve 3000 participants randomly assigned to study intervention. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: The primary outcome of spontaneous delivery will be analysed using binary logistic regression. Results will be presented as marginal adjusted risk differences between each of the three active treatment groups and the double-placebo group. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The SAINT study is approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics, the European Union Clinical Trials Information System, the Norwegian Medical Products Agency and Institutional Review Boards. Results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and communications to congresses. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Clinical Trials: NCT05719467. EudraCT/EUCT: 2021-000392-37/2024-511848-55-00.",

      "abstract": "Misconceptions surrounding sodium compounds, particularly the interchangeable use of sodium and sodium chloride (table salt), persist within the medical community, influencing dietary recommendations and patient management especially in heart failure (HF) patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This narrative review aims to dissect these misconceptions and discusses the physiological impacts of sodium, chloride, and sodium bicarbonate on cardiovascular (CV) physiology. The conflation of sodium and sodium chloride in dietary recommendations has obscured critical differences in their physiological effects. While sodium chloride is traditionally linked to hypertension, emerging evidence suggests that chloride, rather than sodium, may be the primary driver of hypertension and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. In contrast, sodium bicarbonate, when administered orally, seems to exert minimal effects on blood pressure and plasma volume, offering a promising and safe way for managing HF patients with renal insufficiency. Indeed, the therapeutic benefits of sodium bicarbonate in CKD patients, including preservation of muscle mass, slowing of renal function decline, lowering of all-cause mortality, and improved nutritional status, are quite proven; this underscores its potential utility in patients suffering from both HF and renal insufficiency. Despite concerns about metabolic alkalosis, recent studies suggest that judicious sodium bicarbonate therapy may mitigate major adverse cardiac events without exacerbating HF. This review advocates for a paradigm shift in CV medicine, urging clinicians to discern between sodium chloride and other sodium salts, particularly sodium bicarbonate, in patient care. By elucidating these distinctions, clinicians can tailor dietary recommendations and therapeutic interventions to optimize outcomes for HF patients with CKD and address the multi-faceted complexities of atherosclerotic disease."

Herein, we introduce an acid/glutathione (GSH)-dual responsive nano-prodrug (AS1411@Dox+GA/NPs) enabling precise co-delivery of Dox and GA for enhanced combination therapy. The GSH-activated Dox prodrug [Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-disulfide-Dox, PLGA-ss-Dox], GA, and sulfur-terminated D-α-tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS-SH) are combined to form a nanoemulsion with sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) in the aqueous phase. The AS1411 aptamer is modified on the surface for tumor-specific targeting. Upon reaching the tumor via enhanced penetration and retention effects, AS1411 aptamer medicates specific endocytosis of AS1411@Dox+GA/NPs into tumor cells. Intracellularly, the acidic endosomal environment promotes carbon dioxide (CO2) production from NaHCO3, disrupting the nanoemulsion and causing a burst release of GA and PLGA-ss-Dox prodrug. Concurrently, high levels of GSH in the cytoplasm triggers the cleavage of the disulfide linker, thereby releasing Dox. Notably, the released NaHCO3 consumed hydrogen ion (H+), amplifying the sensitivity of tumor cells to Dox. As a consequence, AS1411@Dox+GA/NPs exhibits remarkable synergistic therapeutic efficacy in mouse models of both liver cancer and breast cancer. This work presents an appealing approach utilizing stimuli-sensitive nano-prodrug for advanced combinational cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "Sodium bicarbonate, commonly known as baking soda, is present in various over-the-counter medications sold to the general public, including for the treatment of gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and dyspepsia. Less well known to the public are the severe complications associated with these treatments and their overuse, which can lead to significant toxicity, including metabolic alkalosis and associated electrolyte imbalances, further perpetuating or even worsening the acid-base disorder. In this case report, we present a 45-year-old woman with a history of locally invasive breast cancer, who underwent primary chemotherapy and radiotherapy with remission. She presented to the Emergency Department with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort that began one month earlier, along with asthenia and weight loss predating these symptoms. She had begun taking over-the-counter medications recommended by a local herbalist, some of which contained sodium bicarbonate or calcium carbonate. The patient was hypotensive, vomiting, and showed signs of dehydration. Her blood gas analysis revealed severe metabolic alkalosis with significant hypokalemia and hypochloremia. Prompt treatment was initiated, and the patient was admitted to the Intermediate Care Unit. Following an exhaustive diagnostic workup for her initial symptoms, pyloric stenosis caused by a locally advanced gastric neoformation was identified and later confirmed to be carcinoma. The patient was referred to the Oncology Group, where primary chemotherapy was recommended and initiated; however, the patient ultimately succumbed to her illness. In conclusion, recognizing and understanding the mechanisms underlying the generation and maintenance of metabolic alkalosis, along with its causes and a thorough review of the patient's medical history, are crucial for clinicians to ensure proper and timely intervention and correction of the acid-base disorder."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the cerumenolytic efficacy of 2.5 % sodium bicarbonate prepared in-house with that of commercially available 0.5 % sodium docusate, utilizing cerumen weight gain and disintegration degree as metrics. METHODS: Cerumen samples were collected from patients at an otorhinolaryngology outpatient clinic at a tertiary care hospital. This study evaluated the differences in cerumen weight and degree of disintegration in vitro before and after treatment with cerumenolytic agents at 15 and 30 min and at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 h. The agents tested were 2.5 % sodium bicarbonate and 0.5 % sodium docusate. Each experiment was conducted at least five times. We hypothesized that greater weight gain and higher disintegration scores indicate better cerumenolytic efficacy. RESULTS: Both cerumenolytic agents caused significant increases in wet and dry cerumen weights at all time points (P < 0.001). After 24 h, the cerumen weight increased approximately sevenfold from the initial weight. Notably, the weight increased by 50 % of the 24-hour value within the first hour. A comparison of the average weight gain between the 2.5 % sodium bicarbonate and 0.5 % sodium docusate groups revealed no significant differences at any time point (P = 0.406). Similarly, disintegration scores obtained via the 96-well plate method were not significantly different (P = 0.749). CONCLUSIONS: In terms of cerumen weight gain and degree of disintegration, the cerumenolytic efficacy of 2.5 % sodium bicarbonate is not inferior to that of 0.5 % sodium docusate. A 1-hour application of a cerumenolytic agent is effective for cerumen removal in outpatient settings.",

The improvement of SrFs through an environmentally friendly treatment employing sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃) at different concentrations (5 %, 10 %, 20 %, and 30 % by weight) over various durations (24, 72, and 168 h) is the subject of this study. The objective is to provide a sustainable and economical approach to enhancing fiber characteristics. Comparisons were made between treated and untreated fibers and fibers from semi-arid and humid regions to evaluate geographical influences. Key findings include considerable enhancements in tensile properties: a 58 % rise in Young's modulus and a 69 % rise in traction stress for fibers treated with 20 % NaHCO₃ for 72 h. The stretching at fracture of these treated fibers was measured at 1.04 ± 4.49 %. The treated fibers also showed an increased crystallinity index of 71.61 % and a crystal size of 2.38 nm. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy revealed the chemical modifications from the treatment. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated thermal stability up to 327 °C and a kinetic activation energy of 53.84 kJ/mol, compared to 62.72 kJ/mol for untreated fibers. The study highlights an environmentally friendly approach to material development by showcasing the potential of treated SrFs in lightweight biocomposite applications. This study provides valuable information on the TGA/pyrolysis of SrFs at 10 °C/min for potential bioenergy production, including assessing environmental impact, opportunities concerning sustainable resource management, and integration with other renewable energy systems.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Sepsis is an uncontrolled systemic response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. The in-hospital mortality rate remains significantly high in septic shock patients with malignancies. This study investigates whether early and high-volume administration of sodium bicarbonate during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) can reduce 28-day mortality, increase shock reversal rates, and shorten the duration of CRRT, mechanical ventilation, and intensive care unit (ICU) stays. The goal is to provide valuable clinical data for the management of cancer patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SAKI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 88 patients who were admitted to the ICU and received continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for acute renal failure secondary to sepsis at the Cancer Center of Sun Yat-sen University from March 2010 to October 2021. Based on the initiation time of CRRT and the volume of sodium bicarbonate infusion, patients were divided into four groups: the early high-volume group, early low-volume group, late high-volume group, and late low-volume group. RESULTS: The results of this study showed that in the 28-day mortality model, established using the Cox proportional hazards method, early CRRT (HR 0.473; 95% CI 0.245-0.915, p = 0.026) and high-volume sodium bicarbonate infusion (HR 0.173; 95% CI 0.078-0.383, p < 0.001) were identified as two independent protective factors. The 28-day mortality rate in the early high-volume group (15.0%) was significantly lower than that of the other three groups (60.0%, 30.0%, and 75.0%, respectively; χ2 = 23.822, p < 0.001). Additionally, the shock reversal rate in the early high-volume group (80.0%) was significantly higher compared to the other groups (35.0%, 45.0%, and 35.7%; χ2 =13.576, p = 0.004). The duration of CRRT was shorter in the early high-volume group (35.0 ± 4.45 h) than in the other groups (70.0 ± 30.19 h, 48.0 ± 5.22 h, and 72.0 ± 19.84 h; χ2 =11.278, p = 0.01). Furthermore, the duration of mechanical ventilation (7.0 ± 3.33 days) was lower in the early high-volume group compared to the other groups (8.0 ± 1.12 days,10.0 ± 1.11 days, and 8.0 ± 2.65 days; χ2 =8.064, p = 0.045), as was the length of ICU stay (7.0 ± 0.89 days) compared to the other groups (13.0 ± 3.35 days, 10.0 ± 1.49 days, and10.0 ± 3.70 days; χ2 = 9.184, p = 0.027). CONCLUSION: Early and high-volume administration of sodium bicarbonate during CRRT may reduce 28-day mortality and improve shock reversal rates in patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury complicated by malignancy. Prospective randomized controlled large sample studies are needed to confirm this.",

This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of isotonic sodium bicarbonate infusion (ISB) versus balanced crystalloid solution (BCS) on perioperative acid-base balance, in terms of postoperative base excess, among patients undergoing emergency laparotomy for perforation peritonitis. METHODS: This prospective, randomized, single-center, double-blinded study was conducted in a tertiary hospital from October 2021 to November 2022. A total of 90 patients undergoing emergency laparotomy for perforation peritonitis were randomly assigned to receive either isotonic sodium bicarbonate (ISB) or Ringer's Lactate as a balanced crystalloid solution (BCS) for perioperative maintenance fluid therapy. The primary outcome was to compare the base excess (BE) at the end of surgery. The secondary outcomes were to compare the postoperative clinical outcomes, including the requirement of vasopressors, duration of mechanical ventilation, HDU/ICU stay, the incidence of AKI within seven days, the incidence of re-exploration, and in-hospital mortality. Additionally, pH, PaCO2, HCO3, BE, and lactates intraoperatively and up to 24 h postoperatively were also compared. RESULTS: The median base excess (BE) values at the end of surgery were significantly better in the ISB group - 4.80 [- 6.80, - 4.10] as compared to the BCS group - 7.30 [- 8.50, - 6.30]. The ISB group had a lower incidence of postoperative AKI (9% ISB versus 24% BCS) and requirement of vasopressors (18% ISB versus 44% BCS). However, there was no major difference between the incidence of re-exploration, length of ICU/HDU stay, and in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: Infusing isotonic sodium bicarbonate (ISB) for intraoperative maintenance fluid therapy in patients undergoing emergency laparotomy for perforation peritonitis significantly improves perioperative acid-base balance with better postoperative clinical outcomes compared to a balanced crystalloid solution (BCS).",

      "abstract": "Sodium bicarbonate has been used in the treatment of different pathologies, such as hyperkalemia, cardiac arrest, tricyclic antidepressant toxicity, aspirin toxicity, acute acidosis, lactic acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis, rhabdomyolysis, and adrenergic receptors' resistance to catecholamine in patients with shock. An ongoing debate about bicarbonate's efficacy and potential harm has been raised for decades because of the lack of evidence supporting its potential efficacy. Despite the guidelines' restrictions, sodium bicarbonate has been overused in clinical practice. The overuse of sodium bicarbonate could be because of the desire to correct the arterial blood gas parameters rapidly instead of achieving homeostasis by treating the cause of the metabolic acidosis. Moreover, it is believed that sodium bicarbonate may reverse acidosis-induced myocardial depression, hemodynamic instability, ventricular arrhythmias, impaired cellular energy production, resistance to catecholamines, altered metabolism, enzyme suppression, immune dysfunction, and ineffective oxygen delivery. On the other hand, it is crucial to pay attention to the potential harm that could be caused by excessive sodium bicarbonate administration. Sodium bicarbonate may cause paradoxical respiratory acidosis, intracellular acidosis, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, alkalosis, impaired oxygen delivery, cerebrospinal fluid acidosis, and neurologic dysfunction. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiology of sodium bicarbonate-induced adverse effects and potential benefits. We also review the most recent clinical trials, observational studies, and guidelines discussing the use of sodium bicarbonate in different pathologies."

      "abstract": "Over half million individuals suffer from chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide. In addition to raising the possibility of cardiovascular diseases, skeletal myopathy remains a challenging complication that is highly correlated with mortality and a lower quality of life. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is an active cytokine for mobilization of immunological and hematopoietic stem cells that can replace exogenous stem cell infusions. So, it is seen as a less expensive and noninvasive tool for regenerative medicine. Sixty three rats were divided into 4 groups: I control, II CKD induced, IIIa, IIIb treated and IV recovery groups. After induction of CKD in all rats, group II were sacrificed after 4 weeks. Rats of group IIIa received NaHCO3. Group IIIb rats were injected subcutaneously by G-CSF as 100 µg/kg/day for 5 successive days in addition to NaHCO3 as group IIIa. Group IV rats were housed for 4 weeks without treatment. Serum urea, creatinine, tissue MDA& TNF-α were assessed. Renal and gastrocnemius muscle sections were evaluated for histological structure, CD34 and myogenin immune expression, morphometric and statistical analyses. The CKD group revealed a significant increase in MDA and TNF-α. Furthermore, features of renal injury, muscle degenerative changes, increased collagen and decreased CD34 and myogenin expression were observed. Alterations were partially attenuated by NaHCO3, while GCSF remarkably improved most parameters. The current results indicated that co-administration of GCSF and NaHCO3 could ameliorate CKD myopathy via attenuating oxidative stress, immunomodulation, pro-angiogenic ability, myocyte regeneration. In addition to the reduction of mitochondrial stress and maintenance of cellular homeostasis.",

Sodium bicarbonate has been shown to help reduce symptoms of metabolic acidosis, but its benefits for bone health remain uncertain. Potassium bicarbonate has become a potential new treatment due to its reduction in bone resorption markers, unlike sodium bicarbonate. However, very few studies have looked at the connection between bone functionality and potassium bicarbonate supplementation, especially under the influence of an acidic challenge. To determine the impact of potassium bicarbonate and sodium bicarbonate on the mechanical, structural, compositional, and cellular properties of bone, acidotic mice were given either potassium bicarbonate or sodium bicarbonate for seven days. Blood gas analysis was conducted to evaluate their acidotic states throughout the study. After experimentation, the mice were euthanized, and their femurs excised for further analysis. Before bicarbonate supplementation, the acidotic mice given sodium bicarbonate were in acidosis while the acidotic mice given potassium bicarbonate were in acidemia. The bicarbonate treatment somewhat rescued the blood gas parameters in both acidosis groups, but acidemia and bone dissolution continued occurring in the acidotic mice given potassium bicarbonate, as made evident by the continuous elevation in blood sodium levels compared to the control. The acidosis group given potassium bicarbonate group also had worsened composition and structure, while the acidosis group given sodium bicarbonate had no changes in bone metrics. In this study, potassium bicarbonate was not effective at reducing bone dissolution under acidotic conditions.",

      "abstract": "Aims/Background Hyperuricemia is a metabolic disorder characterized by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood. If left untreated, hyperuricemia can progress to gout, which manifests as acute arthritic attacks, and may also lead to uric acid nephrolithiasis and other renal conditions. This widespread condition poses significant risks to human health and quality of life. This study retrospectively evaluated the effectiveness and safety of using benzbromarone in combination with sodium bicarbonate tablets for the treatment of gout associated with hyperuricemia. Methods The study reviewed the electronic medical records (EMR) of 150 patients with gout and hyperuricemia who were admitted to our hospital between May 2018 and December 2023. These patients were divided into two groups: a control group and a research group. The control group received oral sodium bicarbonate tablets, while the research group was treated with oral benzbromarone tablets in addition to sodium bicarbonate tablets. The study compared the treatment outcomes and adverse reactions between the two groups, as well as assessed changes in blood-related indicators, the number of tophi, pain levels, and quality of life before and after treatment. Results The research group demonstrated a higher total effective rate compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Post-treatment, the research group exhibited significantly lower levels of serum uric acid (UA), serum creatinine (Scr), and urea (p < 0.05). Additionally, this group had fewer tophi and lower visual analog scale (VAS) scores compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Quality of life scores were also significantly higher in the research group (p < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was found in the incidence of adverse drug reactions between the two groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion The combination of benzbromarone and sodium bicarbonate tablets is highly effective in treating gout associated with hyperuricemia. This treatment not only reduces uric acid levels and the number of tophi but also enhances renal function, alleviates pain, and improves the overall quality of life for patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous reports highlighted the efficacy of hemofiltration utilizing isotonic sodium bicarbonate solution as replacement fluid for severe metabolic acidosis. This approach corrects metabolic acidosis by eliminating chloride and supplementing bicarbonate. Here, we present the results of an in vitro study aimed at determining the effect of Isotonic sodium bicarbonate-based Continuous HemoDiafiltration (IBB-CHDF). METHODS: Conventional Continuous HemoDiaFiltration (CHDF) and IBB-CHDF utilized aqueous solutions mimicking blood's electrolyte composition. To assess the efficacy and safety, we compared serial changes in pH, HCO3-, Na+, and K+ concentrations. Blood flow rate was 100 mL/min, and the dialysis fluid flow rate maintained 1.0 L/h for both CHDF and IBB-CHDF. Replacement flow rates ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 L/h for CHDF and 0.1 to 1.5 L/h for IBB-CHDF. RESULTS: At a replacement flow rate of 0.5 L/h with IBB-CHDF, bicarbonate increased from 14.7 mEq/L to within the physiological range (25.9 mEq/L), whereas in conventional CHDF, the post-treatment bicarbonate concentration did not increase (16.5 mEq/L). The maximum bicarbonate concentration achieved was 22.0 mEq/L at a replacement flow rate of 1.5 L/h in conventional CHDF. Notably, in IBB-CHDF, the sodium concentration remained constant at 150 mEq/L, 10 mEq/L higher than conventional CHDF, and did not escalate despite increasing the replacement flow rate. CONCLUSION: IBB-CHDF effectively corrects metabolic acidosis without inducing sodium and water overload by eliminating excess chloride while providing bicarbonate.",

Therefore, normalization of tumor microenvironment via lactic acid neutralization can be a promising avenue for overcoming this therapeutic hurdle.

Their effects on assisting DOXIL and anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy were investigated. NaHCO3@Flip achieved deep tumor penetration, with the ability to neutralize lactic acid and normalize the acidic tumor microenvironment. NaHCO3@Flip is biosafe and can enhance cellular uptake efficiency of doxorubicin (DOX) by overcoming the ion-trapping barrier and amplify immunogenic cell death induced by DOX. The combination therapy of liposomal DOX and NaHCO3@Flip demonstrated enhanced inhibition of tumor growth. NaHCO3@Flip can also synergize with PD-1 antibody therapy. NaHCO3@Flip has the potential to serve as a therapeutic adjuvant for boosting chemoimmunotherapy by overcoming the ion-trapping effect and normalizing the tumor microenvironment.",

SUBJECTS/METHODS: Retrospective data was collected via chart review. 288 eyes of 144 patients with IIH, including those taking ACZ alone (control group, n = 89) vs. ACZ and NaHCO3 (treatment group, n = 56). The primary outcome measure was time to IIH resolution. Secondary outcomes included retinal nerve fibre layer thickness (RNFL), visual field mean deviation (VFMD), visual acuity (VA), discontinuation ACZ, and patient-reported side effects of ACZ. RESULTS: Cox proportional hazards model for the primary outcome yielded a hazard ratio of 0.800, which was statistically insignificant (95% CI, 0.57-1.13; p = 0.200). There was no significant difference between groups when comparing RNFL, VFMD, VA, surgical intervention, or discontinuation of ACZ. The treatment group was more likely to experience side effects from ACZ prior to starting sodium bicarbonate therapy (p < 0.001). Among the treatment group, 92.7% remained on NaHCO3 until IIH resolution, and 9 of 12 (75%) subjects reported significant improvement in ACZ-related side effects. CONCLUSION: Sodium bicarbonate does not appear to impact treatment outcomes in patients taking acetazolamide for IIH. Sodium bicarbonate may represent a reasonable adjunctive medication to help mitigate acetazolamide-related side effects in this group of patients.",

      "abstract": "The high metabolic requirements of cancer cells result in excess accumulation of H+ in the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, the extracellular pH of solid tumors is acidic, whereas the pH of normal tissues is more alkaline. The acidic tumor environment is correlated with tumor metastasis, immune escape, and chemoresistance, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Herein, we demonstrate that sodium bicarbonate, a weakly alkaline compound, induces cytotoxicity in ovarian cancer cells and hinders cancer migration and invasion in vitro. The anti-cancer efficacy of Olaparib can be significantly augmented when combined with sodium bicarbonate. In vivo experiments suggest that the combinatorial treatment of sodium bicarbonate and Olaparib is biocompatible and more effective at inhibiting ovarian cancer growth than either treatment alone. Additionally, RNA-sequencing results reveal that the differentially expressed genes are enriched in pathways related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, such as the cGMP/PKG pathway. The combined treatment increases M1 macrophage composition in tumors and reduces the accumulation of excessive ROS. These findings strongly suggest that sodium bicarbonate holds great potential as an adjuvant treatment by scavenging ROS accumulation and promoting M1 macrophage composition, thereby enhancing Olaparib's anti-cancer activity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The use of sodium bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis has been a topic of debate, primarily due to the lack of clinical efficacy evidence. This study aims to identify which types of patients with various acid-base balance parameters can benefit from sodium bicarbonate therapy. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with metabolic acidosis were screened from a large multi-center critical care database to form a retrospective cohort. Mortality curves, logistic regression analysis, simulation methods, and propensity scores were used to compare data between sodium bicarbonate (SOB group) and non-treated (Non-SOB group) patients. RESULTS: There was an interaction between baseline chloride, anion gap levels and sodium bicarbonate therapy on patients' in-hospital death. As chloride levels increased, the in-hospital mortality curves of the SOB group and Non-SOB group gradually converged, with the difference narrowing from approximately 20 % to 10 %, and then gradually widened with the increase of the anion gap. Furthermore, when patients had high chloride levels (≥112 mmol/L), those in the SOB group exhibited a higher incidence of hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and hypocalcemia at 24 h, and a lower incidence of hyperchloremia. Patients in SOB group also had a lower simulated mortality. Among patients treated with sodium bicarbonate, those with low chloride had more difficulty in normalizing pH compared to those with high chloride. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified an interaction between baseline chloride and sodium bicarbonate therapy on patient survival. Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis may potentially benefit from sodium bicarbonate therapy. Further prospective randomized controlled studies are warranted.",

DESIGN: Double-blind randomized placebo-controlled crossover. METHODS: Thirty female and male athletes performed two bouts of the Wingate Anaerobic Test (WAnTPRE-HIFT and WAnTPOST-HIFT) interspaced with two 3-min bouts of Wall Balls and Burpees 120 min after ingestion of three sodium bicarbonate doses. Blood HCO3- was determined pre-ingestion, after supplementation and before/post exercise. Gastrointestinal upset was evaluated 120 min post-ingestion. Control (CTRL) measurements were performed. RESULTS: There were significant gender × treatment interactions for: changes in blood HCO3- at 60 min post-ingestion (p = 0.014; η2p = 0.104; at 0.15 gSB·kgFFM-1 males experienced higher increase than females); peak power (p = 0.015; η2p = 0.103) and average power (p = 0.005; η2p = 0.124) during WAnTPOST-HIFT, and changes in peak power between the Wingate Anaerobic Test bouts (p = 0.049; η2p = 0.081). Sodium bicarbonate compared to PLA had no significant impact on Wall Balls and Burpees performance. The dose of 0.35 gSB·kgFFM-1 resulted in higher less severe gastrointestinal symptoms compared to CTRL and 0.15 gSB·kgFFM-1 (p = 0.001; W = 0.178); and higher total gastrointestinal upset compared to CTRL, PLA and 0.15 gSB·kgFFM-1 (p < 0.001; W = 0.323).

METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy and safety of sodium bicarbonate versus placebo or standard treatment in kidney-transplant and non-transplant patients with CKD. RESULTS: Sixteen studies of kidney-transplant recipients (two studies, 280 patients) and non-transplant patients with CKD (14 studies, 1,380 patients) were included. With non-transplant patients, sodium bicarbonate slowed kidney-function declines (standardized mean difference [SMD]: 0.49, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.14-0.85, p = 0.006) within ≥12 months (SMD: 0.75 [95% CI: 0.12-1.38], p = 0.02), baseline-serum bicarbonate <22 mmol/L (SMD: 0.41 [95% CI: 0.19-0.64], p = 0.0004) and increased serum-bicarbonate levels (mean difference [MD]: 2.35 [95% CI: 1.40-3.30], p < 0.00001). In kidney-transplant recipients, sodium bicarbonate did not preserve graft function (SMD: -0.07 [95% CI: -0.30-0.16], p = 0.56) but increased blood pH levels (MD: 0.02 [95% CI: 0.00-0.04], p = 0.02). No significant adverse events occurred in the kidney-transplant or non-transplant patients (risk ratio [RR]: 0.89, [95% CI: 0.47-1.67], p = 0.72; and RR 1.30 [95% CI: 0.84-2.00], p = 0.24, respectively). However, oral sodium bicarbonate correlated with increased diastolic pressure and worsened hypertension and edema (MD: 2.21 [95% CI: 0.67-3.75], p = 0.005; RR: 1.44 [95% CI: 1.11-1.88], p = 0.007; and RR: 1.28 [95% CI: 1.00-1.63], p = 0.05, respectively). DISCUSSION: Oral sodium bicarbonate may slow kidney-function decline in non-transplant patients with CKD taking sodium bicarbonate supplementation for ≥12 months or a baseline serum bicarbonate level of <22 mmol/L, without preserving graft function in kidney-transplant recipients. Sodium bicarbonate may increase diastolic pressure, and elevate a higher incidence of worsening hypertension and edema.

This study demonstrates that NaHCO3, which can be derived from the flue gases and alkaline textile wastewater, significantly enhances pollutant removal and biomass production. Optimal addition of NaHCO3 was found to achieve an inorganic-to-organic carbon ratio of 1.0 and a total carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of 5.0. Metagenomic analysis and structural equation modeling showed that NaHCO3 addition increased dissolved oxygen concentrations and pH levels, creating a more favorable environment for key microbial communities, including Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Cyanobacteria. Confocal laser scanning microscopy further confirmed enhanced interactions between Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria/Chloroflexi, facilitating the MBGS process. These microbes harbored functional genes (gap2, GLU, and ppk) critical for removing organics, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Carbon footprint analysis revealed significant reductions in CO2 emissions by the NaHCO3-added MBGS process in representative countries (China, Australia, Canada, Germany, and Morocco), compared to the conventional activated sludge process. These findings highlight the effectiveness of NaHCO3 in optimizing MBGS process, establishing it as a key strategy in achieving carbon-neutral wastewater treatment globally.",

This hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation may be mediated by the activation of peripheral chemoreceptors implicated in the regulation of respiration in reaction to various chemical stimuli, including reductions in arterial pH. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that during passive heating at rest, the increases in arterial pH achieved with sodium bicarbonate ingestion, which could attenuate peripheral chemoreceptor activity, mitigate hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation. We also assessed the effect of sodium bicarbonate ingestion on cerebral blood flow responses, which are associated with hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation. Twelve healthy men ingested sodium bicarbonate (0.3 g/kg body weight) or sodium chloride (0.208 g/kg). One hundred minutes after the ingestion, the participants were passively heated using hot-water immersion (42°C) combined with a water-perfused suit. Increases in esophageal temperature (an index of core temperature) and minute ventilation (V̇E) during the heating were similar in the two trials. Moreover, when V̇E is expressed as a function of esophageal temperature, there were no between-trial differences in the core temperature threshold for hyperventilation (38.0 ± 0.3 vs. 38.0 ± 0.4°C, P = 0.469) and sensitivity of hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation as assessed by the slope of the core temperature-V̇E relation (13.5 ± 14.2 vs. 15.8 ± 15.5 L/min/°C, P = 0.831). Furthermore, middle cerebral artery mean blood velocity (an index of cerebral blood flow) decreased similarly with heating duration in both trials. These results suggest that sodium bicarbonate ingestion does not mitigate hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation and the reductions in cerebral blood flow index in resting heated humans.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Hyperthermia leads to hyperventilation and associated cerebral hypoperfusion, both of which may impair heat tolerance. This hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation may be mediated by peripheral chemoreceptors, which can be activated by reductions in arterial pH. However, our results suggest that sodium bicarbonate ingestion, which can increase arterial pH, is not an effective intervention in alleviating hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation and cerebral hypoperfusion in resting heated humans.",

      "abstract": "KEY POINTS: Sodium bicarbonate for patients with CKD and metabolic acidosis leads to a significant improvement in kidney function. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate increases in mid-arm muscle circumference, indicating a positive effect on enhancing muscle mass. Sodium bicarbonate supplementation is associated with a higher risk of elevated systolic BP, marking a potential side effect. BACKGROUND: In patients with CKD, impaired kidney acid excretion leads to the onset of metabolic acidosis (MA). However, the evidence is not yet conclusive regarding the effects of sodium bicarbonate in treating CKD with MA. METHODS: Databases with PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were used to search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from the inception until November 11, 2023, to identify RCTs investigating the effect of sodium bicarbonate in participants with CKD and MA. The primary outcome was the change in eGFR. Secondary outcomes included hospitalization rates, change in systolic BP, all-cause mortality, and mid-arm muscle circumference. A random-effects model was applied for analysis, and subgroup, sensitivity analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Fourteen RCTs comprising 2037 patients demonstrated that sodium bicarbonate supplementation significantly improved eGFR (standardized mean difference [SMD], 0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03 to 0.63; P = 0.03). The group receiving sodium bicarbonate had a lower hospitalization rate (odds ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.55; P < 0.001). Higher mid-arm muscle circumference was observed with sodium bicarbonate treatment compared with those without (SMD, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.38; P = 0.003, I2<0.001). However, higher risk of elevated systolic BP was found with sodium bicarbonate treatment (SMD, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.20; P = 0.03). No significant difference in all-cause mortality was noted. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CKD and MA, sodium bicarbonate supplementation may provide potential benefits in preventing the deterioration of kidney function and increasing muscle mass. However, treatment may be associated with higher BP. Owing to the risk of bias stemming from the absence of double-blinded designs and inconsistencies in control group definitions across the studies, further research is crucial to verify these findings.",

      "abstract": "The subchronic toxicity and toxicokinetics of a combination of rabeprazole sodium and sodium bicarbonate were investigated in dogs by daily oral administration for 13 consecutive weeks with a 4-week recovery period. The dose groups consisted of control (vehicles), (5 + 200), (10 + 400), and (20 + 800) mg/kg of rabeprazole sodium + sodium bicarbonate, 20 mg/kg of rabeprazole sodium only, and 800 mg/kg of sodium bicarbonate only. Esophageal ulceration accompanied by inflammation was observed in only one animal in the male (20 + 800) mg/kg rabeprazole sodium + sodium bicarbonate group. However, the severity of the ulceration was moderate, and the site of occurrence was focally extensive; thus, it was assumed to be a treatment-related effect of rabeprazole sodium + sodium bicarbonate. In the toxicokinetics component of this study, systemic exposure to rabeprazole sodium (AUClast and Cmax at Day 91) was greater in males than females, suggesting sex differences. AUClast and Cmax at Day 91 were increased compared to those on Day 1 in a dose-dependent manner. A delayed Tmax and no drug accumulation were observed after repeated dosage. In conclusion, we suggest under the conditions of this study that the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of the combination of rabeprazole sodium + sodium bicarbonate in male and female dogs is (10 + 400) and (20 + 800) mg/kg, respectively.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In Japan, intravenous injection of a 7 % solution of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) had been originally developed to inhibit motion sickness and then have long been used to treat vertigo. Previously, we reported that Fos-positive neurons appear in the amygdala after hypergravity stimulation in rats. In the present study, we examined whether injection of 7 % NaHCO3 inhibits hypergravity-induced Fos expression in the neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala in rats. METHODS: Rats were exposed to 2 G hypergravity in an animal centrifuge device for 3 h. A solution of 7 % NaHCO3 at a dose of 4 mM/kg was injected intraperitoneally before 2 G hypergraviy. Fos-positive neurons in the amygdala were stained immunohistochemically. RESULTS: The number of Fos-positive neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala was significantly increased after 2 G hypergravity in rats that received no drugs or saline, compared to that in rats exposed only to the noise of the centrifuge and received 7 % NaHCO3 solution. The number of Fos-positive neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala after 2 G hypergravity was significantly decreased in rats that received 7 % NaHCO3 solution, compared to that in rats that received no drugs or saline. CONCLUSION: Since Fos expression is a marker of activated neurons, the present findings suggest that hypergravity activates the amygdala and that administration of 7 % NaHCO3 suppresses hypergravity-induced activation of the amygdala. Hypergravity disturbs spatial orientation to produce motion sickness and the amygdala is involved in fear response. Recently, Ziemann et al. suggested that fear-evoking stimuli reduce the pH in the amygdala to activate it, leading to induction of fear behavior and that administering HCO3- attenuates fear behavior [Cell 2009; 139: 1012-1021]. Therefore, it is possible that hypergravity reduces the pH in the amygdala to activate it, thereby inducing the fear associated with motion sickness and that administration of 7 % NaHCO3 increases the brain pH thereby suppressing hypergravity-induced activation of the amygdala and inhibiting the fear associated with motion sickness. In patients with vertigo, 7 % NaHCO3 therapy may increase the brain pH thereby suppressing the activation of the amygdala and inhibiting the fear associated with vertigo to elicit a beneficial clinical effect.",

METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (Pubmed), Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Clinicaltrials.gov for studies evaluating the efficacy of alkalinization up to 30 April 2023. Based on the PRISMA 2020 statement criteria a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies were performed. RESULTS: The results of our meta-analysis showed a significant reduction in mortality rate in the alkalinization group compared to controls (RR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.56-0.95; I2  =  0%). However, our subgroup analysis showed no significant improvement in RCT-only studies (RR 0.78, 95% CI: 0.59-1.05; I2  =  0%), the recovery rate was significantly higher in the alkalinization group (RR 2.13, 95% CI: 1.39-3.26; I2  =  0%), duration of recovery also has improved in alkalinization group (SMD 0.76, 95% CI: 0.33-1.18; I2  =  0%). The results of our meta-analysis showed a significant reduction in the duration of hospitalization in the alkalinization group compared to controls with very low certainty of evidence (SMD -0.66, 95% CI: -0.97 to -0.35; I2  =  36%). CONCLUSION: With low certainty of evidence, alkalinization (by sodium bicarbonate) can be an efficient and safe adjuvant treatment for COVID-19 patients. Future randomized controlled trials are needed to strengthen the available evidence.",

      "abstract": "Developing the delivery systems with high therapeutic efficacy and low side effects is of great interest and significance for anticancer therapy. Compared to the high cost in synthesizing new chemotherapeutic drugs, exploring the anticancer potentials of existing chemicals is more convenient and efficient. Sodium bicarbonate (BC), a simple inorganic salt, has shown its tumor inhibition capacity via regulating the acidity of tumor microenvironment. However, the effects of intracytoplasmic BC on tumor growth and the potentials of BC to serve as an anticancer agent are still unknown. Herein, we developed a BC-loaded cationic liposome system (BC-CLP) to deliver BC into the cytosol of cancer cells. The in vitro studies showed that the BC-CLP containing 1% BC (w/v) had a size of 112.9 nm and a zeta potential of 19.1 mV, which reduced the viability of the model cancer cells (human oral squamous cell carcinoma HSC-3 cells) to 13.7%. In contrast, the neutral BC-LP caused less than 50% viability reduction. We further found that BC-CLP released BC directly into cytoplasm via membrane fusion pathway rather than endocytosis, leading to the remarkable increase of cytosolic pH, which may contribute to the anticancer effect of BC-CLP. Our findings indicate that BC-CLP is a potential system for high-efficiency cancer therapy without causing drug-related side effects or resistance.",

However, management of severe, refractory DKA with multiple contributors to acidosis, and management of DKA in patients with altered mentation, remain ambiguous. Use of sodium bicarbonate and intubation in DKA are unpopular treatment practices, but warrant consideration in these unique clinical scenarios. This paper describes a 61-year-old Sri Lankan female who presented with severe DKA, seizures and altered level of consciousness. In her case, the acidosis was secondary to DKA, hyperlactatemia, hyperchloraemic acidosis and acute kidney injury (AKI). Intravenous sodium bicarbonate was used in the management of acidosis. She was intubated due to altered level of consciousness with inadequate respiratory drive to compensate for metabolic acidosis. The outcome in her case was favorable. Intravenous sodium bicarbonate in DKA should be considered for patients with severe, refractory acidosis with hemodynamic instability, hyperkalemia and compounding acidosis due to normal anion gap acidosis or AKI. Intubation should be considered for patients with obtunded mentation unable to achieve respiratory compensation and obtunded mentation where reversal of DKA is unlikely to improve consciousness. Both strategies should be personalized with consideration of individual risk vs benefit."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypertonic sodium bicarbonate is advocated for the treatment of sodium channel blocker poisoning, but its efficacy varies amongst different sodium channel blockers. This Commentary addresses common pitfalls and appropriate usage of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate therapy in cardiotoxic drug poisonings. SODIUM BICARBONATE WORKS SYNERGISTICALLY WITH HYPERVENTILATION: Serum alkalinization is best achieved by the synergistic effect of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate and hyperventilation (PCO2 ∼ 30-35 mmHg [0.47-0.6 kPa]). This reduces the dose of sodium bicarbonate required to achieve serum alkalinization (pH ∼ 7.45-7.55) and avoids adverse effects from excessive doses of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate. VARIABILITY IN RESPONSE TO SODIUM BICARBONATE TREATMENT: Tricyclic antidepressant poisoning responds well to sodium bicarbonate therapy, but many other sodium channel blockers may not. For instance, drugs that block the intercellular gap junctions, such as bupropion, do not respond well to alkalinization. For sodium channel blocker poisonings in which the expected response is unknown, a bolus of 1-2 mmol/kg sodium bicarbonate can be used to assess the response to alkalinization. SODIUM BICARBONATE CAN EXACERBATE TOXICITY FROM DRUGS ACTING ON MULTIPLE CARDIAC CHANNELS: Hypertonic sodium bicarbonate can cause electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalaemia and hypocalcaemia, leading to QT interval prolongation and torsade de pointes in poisonings with drugs that have mixed sodium and potassium cardiac channel properties, such as hydroxychloroquine and flecainide. THE GOAL FOR HYPERTONIC SODIUM BICARBONATE IS TO ACHIEVE THE ALKALINIZATION TARGET (∼PH 7.5), NOT COMPLETE CORRECTION OF QRS COMPLEX PROLONGATION: Excessive doses of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate commonly occur if it is administered until the QRS complex duration is < 100 ms. A prolonged QRS complex duration is not specific for sodium channel blocker toxicity. Some sodium channel blockers do not respond, and even when there is a response, it takes a few hours for the QRS complex duration to return completely to normal. In addition, QRS complex prolongation can be due to a rate-dependent bundle branch block. So, no further doses should be given after achieving serum alkalinization (pH ∼ 7.45-7.55). MAXIMAL DOSING FOR HYPERTONIC SODIUM BICARBONATE: A further strategy to avoid overdosing patients with hypertonic sodium bicarbonate is to set maximum doses. Exceeding 6 mmol/kg is likely to cause hypernatremia, fluid overload, metabolic alkalosis, and cerebral oedema in many patients and potentially be lethal. RECOMMENDATION FOR THE USE OF HYPERTONIC SODIUM BICARBONATE IN SODIUM CHANNEL BLOCKER POISONING: We propose that hypertonic sodium bicarbonate therapy be used in patients with sodium channel blocker poisoning who have clinically significant toxicities such as seizures, shock (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg, mean arterial pressure <65 mmHg) or ventricular dysrhythmia. We recommend initial bolus dosing of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate of 1-2 mmol/kg, which can be repeated if the patient remains unstable, up to a maximum dose of 6 mmol/kg. This is recommended to be administered in conjunction with mechanical ventilation and hyperventilation to achieve serum alkalinization (PCO2∼30-35 mmHg [4-4.7 kPa]) and a pH of ∼7.45-7.55. With repeated bolus doses of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate, it is imperative to monitor and correct potassium and sodium abnormalities and observe changes in serum pH and on the electrocardiogram. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertonic sodium bicarbonate is an effective antidote for certain sodium channel blocker poisonings, such as tricyclic antidepressants, and when used in appropriate dosing, it works synergistically with hyperventilation to achieve serum alkalinization and to reduce sodium channel blockade. However, there are many pitfalls that can lead to excessive sodium bicarbonate therapy and severe adverse effects.",

This can be prevented by regular maintenance with mechanical debridement. One of the recent mechanical debridement methods is air abrasion therapy using different abrasive powders. This study aimed to evaluate the two common abrasive powders of different sizes (sodium bicarbonate and erythritol) for their biofilm cleaning efficacy on dental implant surfaces. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  In an in vitro setting, a total of 33 implants were divided into three groups: Group 1 (n =11) = no treatment; group 2 (n = 11) = air abrasion therapy treated group using a sodium bicarbonate powder (AIRFLOW Powder Classic Comfort, EMS Electro Medical Systems, Nyon, Switzerland); and group 3 (n = 11) = air abrasion therapy treated group using an erythritol powder (AIRFLOW Powder Plus, EMS Electro Medical Systems, Nyon, Switzerland). The implants in each group were subjected to biofilm formation, and group 2 and group 3 were treated with air abrasion therapy of two different powders having different sizes with the same settings. The particle sizes were sodium bicarbonate (40 µm) and erythritol (14µm). The surface characteristics of the dental implants in three groups were studied from a digital camera and under the scanning electron microscope at different magnifications. The comparison of biofilm-removal efficacy between the three groups was performed by using a one-way analysis of variance with post-hoc Dunnett's T3 test. A p-value less than 0.05 was chosen to indicate statistical significance. RESULTS:  There were no statistical differences (p > 0.05) between the two powder-treated groups for the biofilm cleaning efficacy. However, both groups showed significantly better biofilm-cleaning efficacy than the control group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION:  This suggests that both powders are effective in removing biofilm from the implant surface under ideal conditions. However, there was no clear distinction between the cleaning potential of the two powders, as both performed in a similar manner."

      "abstract": "Post traumatic epilepsy (PTE) is a treatment-resistant consequence of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Recently, it has been revealed that epileptiform activity in acute chemoconvulsant seizure models is accompanied by transient shrinkages of extracellular space (ECS) called rapid volume pulsations (RVPs). Shrinkage of the ECS surrounding neurons and glia may contribute to ictogenic hyperexcitability and hypersynchrony during the chronic phase of TBI. Here, we identify the phenomenon of RVPs occurring spontaneously in rat neocortex at ≥ 3 weeks after injury in the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model for PTE. We further report that blocking the electrogenic action of the astrocytic cotransporter NBCe1 with 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid (DIDS) eliminates both RVPs and epileptiform activity in ex-vivo CCI neocortical brain slices. We conclude that NBCe1-mediated extracellular volume shrinkage may represent a new target for therapeutic intervention in PTE.",

The findings revealed that added sodium bicarbonate significantly increased (P < 0.05) cooking yield, hardness, springiness, and strength of myofibrillar protein while reducing centrifugal loss. Furthermore, the incorporation of sodium bicarbonate led to a significant decrease in L⁎, a⁎, b⁎, and white values of cooked myofibrillar protein; these effects were further amplified with increasing ultrasonic duration (P < 0.05). Additionally, storage modulus (G') significantly increased for myofibrillar protein treated with ultrasonic-assisted sodium bicarbonate treatment resulting in a more compact gel structure post-cooking. In summary, the results demonstrated that ultrasonic-assisted sodium bicarbonate treatment could enhance the tightness of reduced-salt myofibrillar protein gel structure while improving the water retention and texture properties.",

METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design, twelve recreational male cyclists (age: 31.17 ± 4.91 years; V ˙  O2peak: 47.98 ± 7.68 ml·kg-1·min-1) completed three endurance performance tests following acute SB (ASB, 0.2 g·kg-1 SB), multi-day SB (MSB, 0.2 g·kg-1·day-1 SB for four days), and placebo (PLA) intake. The high-intensity endurance performance was assessed with a cycling exercise test, wherein participants cycled on a bicycle ergometer at 95% of the predetermined anaerobic threshold for 30 min, followed by a time-to-exhaustion test at 110% of the anaerobic threshold. Data were analyzed using one-way and two-way repeated-measures ANOVA. RESULTS: Significant main effects of supplementation protocol were evident in pre-exercise bicarbonate concentrations (F = 27.93; p < 0.01; partial eta squared (η2) = 0.72; false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p value = 0.001). Prior to performance test, blood bicarbonate concentrations were significantly higher in MSB (25.78 ± 1.63 mmol·L-1 [95% CI 26.55-28.44] (p < 0.001; FDR-adjusted p value = 0.001)) and ASB (27.49 ± 1.49 mmol·L-1 [95% CI 24.75-26.81] (p < 0.001; FDR-adjusted p value = 0.007)) compared to PLA (23.75 ± 1.40 mmol·L-1 [95% CI 22.86 to 24.64]). Time-to-exhaustion increased in MSB (54.27 ± 9.20 min [95% CI 48.43-60.12]) compared to PLA (49.75 ± 10.80 min [95% CI 42.89-56.62]) (p = 0.048); however, this increase in MSB did not reach the significance threshold of 1% FDR (FDR-adjusted p value = 0.040). No significant difference was noted in exhaustion times between ASB (51.15 ± 8.39 min [95% CI 45.82-56.48]) and PLA (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Both acute and multi-day administration of low-dose SB improves buffering system in cyclists; nevertheless, neither intervention demonstrates sufficient efficacy in enhancing high-intensity endurance performance.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gingivitis is driven by plaque accumulation and, if left untreated, can progress to irreversible periodontitis. For many, the mechanical action of toothbrushing does not achieve adequate plaque control. The aim of this study was to investigate whether twice-daily use of a toothpaste containing 0.2% high molecular weight (HMW) sodium hyaluronate with 67% sodium bicarbonate and 0.221% sodium fluoride (experimental toothpaste) could improve gingival health compared with a regular fluoride toothpaste (negative control). The study also assessed whether the experimental toothpaste could provide additive gingival health benefit over a toothpaste containing only 67% sodium bicarbonate and 0.221% sodium fluoride (positive control). METHODS: This was a single-center, examiner-blinded, randomized, clinical study in healthy adults with mild-to-moderate gingivitis. At baseline, after abstaining from toothbrushing for 12 h, prospective participants underwent oral soft tissue (OST) and oral hard tissue examination followed by assessments for gingival inflammation (Modified Gingival Index [MGI]), gingival bleeding (Bleeding Index [BI]), and supra-gingival plaque (Turesky Plaque Index [TPI]). Eligible participants were stratified by gender and baseline number of bleeding sites (low: <45; high: ≥45 bleeding sites). Following randomization, participants underwent prophylactic dental treatment. Participants received a full OST examination, MGI, BI and TPI assessments after 3 days, 1, 2 and 6 weeks of product use. RESULTS: In total, 110 participants were screened for study entry and all were randomized to receive one of three toothpastes (experimental: sodium hyaluronate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium fluoride; positive control: sodium bicarbonate, sodium fluoride; negative control: regular fluoride toothpaste). For all measures, significant improvements were observed in participants receiving either sodium bicarbonate-containing toothpaste (experimental or positive control) compared with the regular fluoride toothpaste (negative control) at week 6. No significant difference was observed in any assessment or visit comparing the experimental toothpaste with the positive control. CONCLUSIONS: Both the experimental and the positive control toothpastes demonstrated clinically relevant improvements in gingival health compared with a regular fluoride toothpaste (negative control). However, no additional gingival health improvement was observed for the experimental toothpaste compared with the positive control, therefore, no additional gingival health benefit can be attributed to the inclusion of sodium hyaluronate in this formulation.

This study was conducted to compare the impact of using two types of mouthwash, chlorhexidine and sodium bicarbonate, on COVID-19 symptoms and infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present three-group, double-blind clinical trial examined 116 operating room nurses and anesthesia personnel of certain hospitals of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran. The participants were randomly assigned to three groups: intervention group 1 (chlorhexidine mouthwash), intervention group 2 (sodium bicarbonate mouthwash), and the control group (placebo). Mouthwash was used twice a day (morning and night) for 2 weeks. The participants were monitored in terms of COVID-19-related symptoms for 4 weeks, from the first day of mouthwash use. RESULTS: Fisher's exact test indicated a significant difference between the chlorhexidine and control groups in terms of the onset of COVID-19-related symptoms (p = 0.02). There was no significant difference in the symptoms of COVID-19 between the groups, but the groups were significantly different in terms of all symptoms at a 4-week interval (p = 0.04). Furthermore, headache was less observed in the chlorhexidine (p = 0.007) and sodium bicarbonate (p = 0.03) groups compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The use of 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash can decrease the onset of COVID-19-related symptoms in health-care workers. In addition, this mouthwash can partially reduce the symptoms of this disease in comparison to the control and sodium bicarbonate groups."

Sodium bicarbonate (SB) therapy could be applied to correct potential detrimental acidic disturbances, but the exact impact of SB treatment is unknown. This study aims to investigate the impact of SB on AP patients complicated with hyperlactatemia. METHODS: The study was conducted based on the database named Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV). Propensity matching (PSM) and inverse probability weighting (IPTW) were used to balance the baseline differences. Multivariate regression and marginal structural Cox models were performed to investigate the association between SB and multiple outcomes. RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-three AP patients with hyperlactatemia (initial serum lactate, >2.0 mmol/L) were extracted from the MIMIC-IV database. We found that SB treatment was significantly associated with worse multi-outcomes of AP patients with hyperlactatemia (in-hospital mortality: hazard ratio, 2.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.38-4.39; P < 0.01). Further analysis through marginal structural Cox models showed that SB had adverse impact on in-hospital prognosis of patients with severe lactic acidosis (pH < 7.15,lactate > 2.0 mmol/L). CONCLUSION: Sodium bicarbonate might not be an appropriate treatment for AP patients with hyperlactatemia (lactate > 2.0 mmol/L) or with severe lactic acidosis (pH < 7.15, lactate > 2.0 mmol/L).",

      "abstract": "SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In CKD, metabolic acidosis is commonly treated with alkali in the hope that it will improve bone health. In a post hoc analysis of the Bicarbonate Administration to Stabilize eGFR Pilot Trial, we investigated whether sodium bicarbonate affects serum levels of bone turnover markers and other hormones related to bone health in individuals with CKD who have normal to slightly reduced total CO2 (20-28 mEq/L). Sodium bicarbonate increased serum levels of α-klotho but had no significant effect on other bone health markers, including intact fibroblast growth factor-23 (iFGF-23), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (B-SAP). Further study is needed to determine the effect of bicarbonate administration on clinical aspects of bone health. BACKGROUND: Treatment with alkali has been hypothesized to improve bone health in CKD by mitigating adverse effects of acid on bone mineral. We investigated the effect of treatment with sodium bicarbonate on bone turnover markers and other factors related to bone metabolism in CKD. METHODS: This is a post hoc analysis of the Bicarbonate Administration to Stabilize eGFR Pilot Trial in which 194 individuals with CKD and serum total CO2 20-28 mEq/L were randomly assigned to placebo or one of two doses of sodium bicarbonate (0.5 or 0.8 mEq/kg lean body weight per day) for 28 weeks. The following serum measurements were performed at baseline, week 12, and week 28: B-SAP, c-telopeptide, procollagen type I intact N-terminal propeptide, iPTH, iFGF-23, soluble klotho, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b. The difference (sodium bicarbonate versus placebo) in mean change of each bone biomarker from baseline was determined using linear mixed models. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-eight participants submitted samples for post hoc investigations. Mean eGFR was 37±10 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and mean total CO2 was 24±3 mEq/L at baseline. Sodium bicarbonate induced a dose-dependent increase in soluble klotho levels compared with placebo. There was no significant effect of treatment with either dose of sodium bicarbonate on any of the other bone biomarkers, including iFGF-23, iPTH, and B-SAP. Effects on bone biomarkers were similar in those with baseline serum total CO2 <24 mEq/L compared with those with total CO2 ≥24 mEq/L. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot trial of individuals with CKD and total CO2 20-28 mEq/L, sodium bicarbonate treatment increased serum klotho levels but did not affect other bone health markers over 28 weeks.

A rat model of THS was induced by hemorrhage from a left femur fracture, while an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-induced HULEC-5a cell model was considered as an in vitro THS model. The lung tissue pathology and glycocalyx structure were assessed through hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and transmission electron microscope examination. The levels of glycocalyx-related factors and inflammation-related factors were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of glycocalyx-related proteins, cell junction-related proteins, and proteins involved in the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway was analyzed by western blot. The results showed that both sodium bicarbonate Ringer's solution (BRS) and lactate Ringer's solution (LRS) were effective in restoring mean arterial pressure and heart rate in THS rats. However, LRS has a stronger impact on promoting inflammation and damaging the glycocalyx compared with BRS. In OGD/R-induced HULEC-5a cells, a pH of 7.4 and 6.5 increased inflammation and disrupted the glycocalyx, while a pH of 8.1 had no significant effect on inflammation or glycocalyx. Furthermore, the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway was activated by fluid resuscitation and different pH values. However, the activating effect of BRS and pH 8.1 on the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway was milder compared with LRS and pH6.5. In conclusion, an alkaline recovery environment was more beneficial for the treatment of THS.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sodium bicarbonate (SB) infusion is commonly used to correct metabolic acidosis, but its clinical efficacy remains controversial. This study aims to investigate whether acid-base balance parameters should be a consideration for administering SB treatment. METHODS: Children with metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.35 and bicarbonate < 22 mmol/L) who were treated with or without 50 mg/ml SB injection were grouped and extracted from a retrospective cohort database of the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. The interaction between acid-base balance parameters and SB treatment on mortality was analyzed through mortality curves and cross-effect models. Logistic regression was conducted to estimate the risk of death following SB treatment in the overall children as well as in subgroups, and potential confounding factors were adjusted for. After employing propensity score matching to account for confounding factors, further analysis was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of SB treatment within each chloride subgroup. RESULTS: A total of 5865 children with metabolic acidosis were enrolled, of which 2462 (42.0%) received SB treatment. In the overall population, it was found that SB treatment did not reduce hospital mortality or 28-day mortality. Interactions between acid-base balance parameters (chloride and anion gap) and SB treatment on mortality were observed. Subgroup analysis clarified that when chloride levels were below 107 mmol/L, children treated with SB had higher in-hospital mortality (29.8% vs 14.9%) and 28-day mortality (26.5% vs 13.4%), with adjusted ORs of 2.065 (95% CI, 1.435-2.97) and 1.947 (95% CI, 1.332-2.846), respectively. In contrast, when chloride levels were greater than or equal to 113 mmol/L, children treated with SB had a shorter stay in the PICU (median: 1.1 days vs 5.1 days, adjusted p = 0.004) and lower in-hospital mortality (4.3% vs 10.3%) and 28-day mortality (4.0% vs 8.4%), with adjusted ORs of 0.515 (95% CI, 0.337-0.788) and 0.614 (95% CI, 0.391-0.965), respectively. After controlling for confounding factors through matching, the impact of SB treatment on the risk of death in each chloride subgroup was consistent with the aforementioned results. However, treatment with SB did not significantly increase the risk of death in newborns or children with moderate to severe metabolic acidosis when chloride levels were below 107 mmol/L (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The use of sodium bicarbonate for treating metabolic acidosis has been found to increase mortality in children with low chloride levels but decrease mortality in those with high chloride levels in this study. Further prospective multi-center clinical studies and basic research are needed to validate these findings.",

Materials and methods This was a single-center, prospective, two-arm, double-blinded randomized control trial in which intraperitoneal irrigation with sodium bicarbonate was compared with normal saline in operative laparoscopy. Group I (intervention group) consisted of 40 patients who received intraperitoneal sodium bicarbonate, and Group II (control group) consisted of 40 patients who received normal saline. All procedures were conducted under general anesthesia. Postoperative pain scores were compared between intervention and control groups.  Results The most common indication of laparoscopy was infertility. There was no difference in the duration of surgery between the two arms (p=0.27). The mean value of the visual analog scale (VAS) score at the shoulder tip was found to be significantly reduced in the intervention group at two hours (p=0.02), four hours (p=0.0009), and 12 hours (p=0.0002) after surgery. The mean VAS score at the abdomen and port sites was also found to be significantly reduced in the intervention group in the first 24 hours after surgery (p<0.05). With the increase in the time period from surgery, the mean VAS scores decreased in both intervention and control groups.  Conclusion Intraperitoneal irrigation with sodium bicarbonate is beneficial in reducing postoperative pain in operative laparoscopy. However, multicenter randomized trials with a greater number of participants will be helpful to confirm the findings."

Bicarbonated Ringers solution (BRS) has shown promise due to its composition resembling human Extracellular Fluid and its potential benefits on hemodynamics. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy, mortality rates, hemodynamic effects, and adverse outcomes of Sodium Bicarbonate Ringer's Solution in the treatment of hemorrhagic shock, as compared to other relevant interventions. METHOD: A comprehensive examination of the available literature was performed by conducting systematic searches in prominent databases such as Cochrane, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PubMed. The process employed predefined criteria to extract relevant data and evaluate the quality of the studies. The outcome measures considered encompassed survival rates, mortality, mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and adverse events. RESULT: The meta-analysis of three studies showed that compared to the other crystalloids, the use of BRS had an odds ratio for survival of 1.86 (95% CI: 0.94, 3.71; p = 0.08; I2 = 0%), an odds ratio for total adverse events of 0.14 (95% CI: 0.06, 0.35; p < 0.0001; I2 = 22%), a mean difference in heart rate of -4.49 (95% CI: -7.55, -1.44; p = 0.004; I2 = 13%), and a mean difference in mean arterial pressure of 2.31 (95% CI: -0.85, 5.47; p = 0.15; I2 = 66%). CONCLUSION: BRS demonstrated a significant reduction in complications, including adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), Multiple Organ Dysfunction (MODS), and Total Adverse Effects, when compared to other solutions in the treatment of THS. Additionally, THS patients resuscitated with BRS experienced a notable decrease in heart rate. The findings suggest BRS may contribute to organ stability and potential survival improvement due to its similarity to human Extracellular Fluid and minimal impact on the liver.",

To present a comprehensive synthesis of the effect of oral sodium bicarbonate (SB) supplementation on anthropometric measures in patients with CKD, a systematic review was undertaken in PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google Scholar, of relevant articles published prior to September 2022. The summary statistics of effect size, nonstandardized weighted mean difference (WMD), and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to compare the effects of SB supplementation on anthropometric parameters vs. control group. To detect probable sources of heterogeneity, a series of predefined subgroup analyses were conducted. In total, 17 studies with 21 treatment arms, including 2203 participants (1149 cases, 1054 controls), met our inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. SB supplementation had no significant effect on body weight (BW), midarm muscle circumference (MAMC), or lean body mass (LBM) in patients with CKD. There was a significant increase in body mass index (BMI) (MD: 0.59 kg/m2, 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.93, p = 0.001) after SB supplementation in the overall analysis. In subgroup analysis, LBM was increased in studies that were ≥ 24-week duration (MD: 1.81 kg, 95% CI: 0.81 to 2.81) and in participants with BMI lower than 27 kg/m2 (MD: 1.81 mg/L, 95% CI: 0.81 to 2.81). SB supplementation may yield increases in BMI in predialysis CKD patients. However, our findings did not support the beneficial effects of SB supplementation on other anthropometric outcomes. There is an evident need for long-term high-quality interventions to confirm these findings."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Current international guidelines recommend administrating calcium chloride and sodium bicarbonate to patients with hyperkalemia-induced cardiac arrest, despite limited evidence. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of calcium chloride and sodium bicarbonate on return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in a pig model of hyperkalemia-induced cardiac arrest. DESIGN: A randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled experimental pig study. Hyperkalemia was induced by continuous infusion of potassium chloride over 45 minutes followed by a bolus. After a no flow period of 7 minutes, pigs first received 2 minutes of basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation and subsequently advanced life support. The first intervention dose was administered after the fifth rhythm analysis, followed by a defibrillation attempt at the sixth rhythm analysis. A second dose of the intervention was administered after the seventh rhythm analysis if ROSC was not achieved. In case of successful resuscitation, pigs received intensive care for 1 hour before termination of the study. SETTING: University hospital laboratory. SUBJECTS: Fifty-four female Landrace/Yorkshire/Duroc pigs (38-42 kg). INTERVENTIONS: The study used a 2 × 2 factorial design, with calcium chloride (0.1 mmol/kg) and sodium bicarbonate (1 mmol/kg) as the interventions. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-two pigs were included in the study. Sodium bicarbonate significantly increased the number of animals achieving ROSC (24/26 [92%] vs. 13/26 [50%]; odds ratio [OR], 12.0; 95% CI, 2.3-61.5; p = 0.003) and reduced time to ROSC (hazard ratio [HR] 3.6; 95% CI, 1.8-7.5; p < 0.001). There was no effect of calcium chloride on the number of animals achieving ROSC (19/26 [73%] vs. 18/26 [69%]; OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.4-4.0; p = 0.76) or time to ROSC (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.8-2.9; p = 0.23). CONCLUSIONS: Administration of sodium bicarbonate significantly increased the number of animals achieving ROSC and decreased time to ROSC. There was no effect of calcium chloride on the number of animals achieving ROSC or time to ROSC.",

      "abstract": "Sodium bicarbonate stress caused by NaHCO3 is one of the most severe abiotic stresses affecting agricultural production worldwide. However, little attention has been given to the molecular mechanisms underlying plant responses to sodium bicarbonate stress. To understand phosphorylation events in signaling pathways triggered by sodium bicarbonate stress, TMT-labeling-based quantitative phosphoproteomic analyses were performed on soybean leaf and root tissues under 50 mM NaHCO3 treatment. In the present study, a total of 7856 phosphopeptides were identified from cultivated soybeans (Glycine max L. Merr.), representing 3468 phosphoprotein groups, in which 2427 phosphoprotein groups were newly identified. These phosphoprotein groups contained 6326 unique high-probability phosphosites (UHPs), of which 77.2% were newly identified, increasing the current soybean phosphosite database size by 43.4%. Among the phosphopeptides found in this study, we determined 67 phosphopeptides (representing 63 phosphoprotein groups) from leaf tissue and 554 phosphopeptides (representing 487 phosphoprotein groups) from root tissue that showed significant changes in phosphorylation levels under sodium bicarbonate stress (fold change >1.2 or <0.83, respectively; p < 0.05). Localization prediction showed that most phosphoproteins localized in the nucleus for both leaf and root tissues. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses showed quite different enriched functional terms between leaf and root tissues, and more pathways were enriched in the root tissue than in the leaf tissue. Moreover, a total of 53 different protein kinases and 7 protein phosphatases were identified from the differentially expressed phosphoproteins (DEPs). A protein kinase/phosphatase interactor analysis showed that the interacting proteins were mainly involved in/with transporters/membrane trafficking, transcriptional level regulation, protein level regulation, signaling/stress response, and miscellaneous functions. The results presented in this study reveal insights into the function of post-translational modification in plant responses to sodium bicarbonate stress.",

DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study. SETTING: ED of a tertiary referral hospital in Melbourne, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients presenting to the ED between 1 July 2011 and 20 September 2020 with decompensated metabolic acidosis diagnosed on arterial blood gas (ABG). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We compared characteristics between those treated with or without SB. We studied SB administration characteristics, change in laboratory variables, factors associated with use and dose, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Among 753,613 ED patients, 314 had decompensated metabolic acidosis on ABG, with 17.8% receiving SB. Patients in the SB group had lower median pH, CO2, bicarbonate, and base excess (BE) levels compared with the No SB group (P < 0.01). The median number of SB doses in the SB group was one treatment. This was given at a median total dose of 100 mmol and at a median of 2.8 h after the diagnostic blood gas results. Only 42% of patients in the SB group had a subsequent blood gas measured. In such patients, there was no significant change in pH, bicarbonate, or BE. SB therapy was not independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: ABG-confirmed decompensated metabolic acidosis was rare but associated with a high mortality. SB administration occurred in a minority of patients and in more acidaemic patients. However, SB dose was stereotypical and not tailored to acidosis severity. Assessment of SB effect was infrequent and showed no correction of acidosis. Systematic studies of titrated SB therapy are required to inform current practice."

The present study aimed to examine the effects of prehospital SB use during prolonged CPR on patients' outcome. METHODS: In this retrospective cross-sectional study adult patients aged >18 years who experienced a non-traumatic, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) were compared regarding three outcomes, namely return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), ROSC > 20 minute, and survival to discharge, based on receiving or not-receiving SB during CPR. RESULTS: 330 patients were divided into two equal groups of 165. The two groups had similar conditions regarding gender distribution (p = 0.729); mean age (p = 0.741); underlying diseases (p = 0.027); etiology of arrest (p = 0.135); the initial rhythm (p = 0.324); receiving normal saline solution (p = 1.000), epinephrine (p = 0.848), and atropine during CPR (p = 0.054); and using defibrillation (p = 0.324). Those who received SB had 0.80 times greater likelihood for sustained ROSC (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.47-1.37, p = 0.415), 0.93 times greater likelihood for ROSC at the scene (adjusted OR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.55-1.59, p = 0.798), and 0.34 times greater likelihood for survival to discharge (adjusted OR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.10-1.17, p = 0.087). CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that prehospital SB use by EMS during prolonged CPR did not improve ROSC rate at the scene, sustained ROSC, and survival to discharge."

A multiple centre randomised clinical trial (BICARICU-1) has suggested that sodium bicarbonate infusion titrated to maintain the pH equal or more than 7.30 is associated with a higher survival rate (secondary endpoint) in a prespecified stratum of patients with both severe metabolic acidemia and acute kidney injury patients. Whether sodium bicarbonate infusion may improve survival at day 90 (primary outcome) in these severe acute kidney injury patients is currently unknown. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The sodium bicarbonate for the treatment of severe metabolic acidosis with moderate or severe acute kidney injury in the critically ill: a randomised clinical trial (BICARICU-2) trial is an investigator-initiated, multiple centre, stratified, parallel-group, unblinded trial with a computer-generated allocation sequence and an electronic system-based randomisation. After randomisation, the intervention group will receive 4.2% sodium bicarbonate infusion to target a plasma pH equal or more than 7.30 while the control group will not receive sodium bicarbonate. The primary outcome is the day 90 mortality. Main secondary outcomes are organ support dependences. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial has been approved by the appropriate ethics committee (CPP Nord Ouest, Rouen, France, 25 April 2019, number: 19.03.15.72446). Informed consent is required.

Herein, a simple and drug-free inorganic nanomaterial, alkalescent sodium bicarbonate nanoparticles (NaHCO3 NPs), is prepared via a fast microemulsion method for amplified cancer immunotherapy. The obtained alkalescent NaHCO3 regulates lactic acid metabolism through acid-base neutralization so as to reverse the mildly acidic immunosuppressive tumor environment. Additionally, it can further release high amounts of Na+ ions inside tumor cells and induce a surge in intracellular osmolarity, and thus activate the pyroptosis pathway and immunogenic cell death (ICD), release damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and inflammatory factors, and improve immune responses. Collectively, NaHCO3 NPs observably inhibit primary/distal tumor growth and tumor metastasis through acid neutralization remitted immunosuppression and pyroptosis induced immune activation, showing an enhanced antitumor immunity efficiency. This work provides a new paradigm for lactic acid metabolism and pyroptosis mediated tumor treatment, which has a potential for application in clinical tumor immunotherapy.",

In this study, we aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of tegoprazan-based and esomeprazole/sodium bicarbonate-based triple therapies in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients with H. pylori infection treated with a 14-day tegoprazan-based triple therapy or 14-day esomeprazole/sodium bicarbonate-based triple therapy. The primary end point was the H. pylori eradication rate with first-line treatment in an intention-to-treat analysis. Secondary end points included the eradication rate with first-line therapy in the per-protocol analysis and adverse events associated with eradication therapy. RESULTS: Of the 854 included patients, 435 were treated with tegoprazan-based therapy, and 419 received esomeprazole/sodium bicarbonate-based therapy. In the intention-to-treat population, no significant difference in eradication rate was detected between the tegoprazan-treated and esomeprazole/sodium bicarbonate-treated groups (78.6% [95% confidence interval (CI), 74.6-82.3%] vs 81.4% [95% CI, 77.4-84.9%], P = 0.313). The per-protocol analysis also revealed a similar eradication rate between groups (tegoprazan vs esomeprazole/sodium bicarbonate: 85.5% [95% CI, 81.8-87.5%] vs 87.8% [95% CI, 84.1-90.7%], P = 0.339). However, abdominal discomfort and diarrhea were more common in the esomeprazole/sodium bicarbonate-treated group than in the tegoprazan-treated group (abdominal discomfort: 1.1% vs 3.8%, P = 0.012; diarrhea: 9.9% vs 21.2%, P < 0.001). DISCUSSION: The efficacy of the esomeprazole/sodium bicarbonate-based triple therapy for H. pylori eradication was comparable with that of the tegoprazan-based triple therapy. However, esomeprazole/sodium bicarbonate-based therapy exhibited a higher risk of abdominal discomfort and diarrhea than tegoprazan-based therapy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effect of correcting metabolic acidosis on protein metabolism in hemodialysis patients is controversial. OBJECTIVES: To study the effects of oral sodium bicarbonate on protein metabolism and markers of inflammation in acidotic hemodialysis patients. Patients and Methods. An open-label randomized controlled trial was conducted at a single center. Sixty-six clinically stable adult hemodialysis patients were recruited with an average predialysis serum bicarbonate level of <22 mmol/l and a dialysate bicarbonate concentration of 35 mmol/l. Forty-nine participants have completed the study. Oral sodium bicarbonate tablets of 500 mg were given daily in the intervention group (n = 25) for 12 weeks versus the standard of care in the control group (n = 24). Outcomes compared intervention versus nonintervention in both groups at equivalent time points (0 and 3 months). The clinical data, anthropometry, dialysis adequacy, albumin, normalized protein catabolism rate, blood gas analysis, and bicarbonate were recorded at 0 and 3 months. In addition, muscle mass and handgrip strength were measured. Finally, IL-6 as a marker of inflammation was measured at randomization and three months. RESULTS: Serum bicarbonate and pH increased significantly from 17.57 ± 3.34 mmol/L to 20.69 ± 2.54 mmol/L and from 7.26 ± 0.06 to 7.34 ± 0.04, respectively (p < 0.0001). Serum albumin was significantly higher in the intervention group at three months than in the control group, 4.11 ± 0.45 vs. 3.79 ± 0.47 (p value 0.011). Serum potassium significantly decreased in the intervention group at three months compared to the control group, 5.00 ± 0.43 mEq/l vs. 5.33 ± 0.63 mEq/l (p value 0.03). Muscle strength expressed as handgrip has improved significantly in the intervention group at three months compared to the control group, 45.01 ± 19.19 vs. 33.93 ± 15.06 (p value 0.03). The IL-6 values were less in the intervention group at 3 months with a p value of 0.01. The interdialytic weight of the intervention group at three months was 2.42 ± 0.64 compared to the 2.20 ± 1.14 control group, but this did not reach statistical significance (p value of 0.4). The composite of (albumin + nPCR) at three months was achieved in 59.18% of the intervention group compared to 14.28% with a p value of 0.01. CONCLUSIONS: Correcting metabolic acidosis in hemodialysis patients improved serum albumin and nPCR without hypokalemia or significant interdialytic weight gain. This was particularly evident in patients with minimal inflammation with low IL-6 values."

OBJECTIVE: This study retrospectively examined whether changes in TTE cycling performance are mediated by positive expectations of receiving NaHCO3 and/or the decline in blood bicarbonate during exercise. METHODS: In a randomised, crossover, counterbalanced, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, 12 recreationally trained cyclists (maximal oxygen consumption, 54.4 ± 5.7 mL·kg·min-1) performed four TTE cycling tests 90 min after consuming: (1) 0.3 g·kg-1 body mass NaHCO3 in 5 mL·kg-1 body mass solution, (2) 0.03 g·kg-1 body mass sodium chloride in solution (placebo), (3) 0.3 g·kg-1 body mass NaHCO3 in capsules and (4) cornflour in capsules (placebo). Prior to exercise, participants rated on 1-5 Likert type scales how much they expected the treatment they believe had been given would improve performance. Capillary blood samples were measured for acid-base balance at baseline, pre-exercise and post-exercise. RESULTS: Administering NaHCO3 in solution and capsules improved TTE compared with their respective placebos (solution: 27.0 ± 21.9 s, p = 0.001; capsules: 23.0 ± 28.1 s, p = 0.016). Compared to capsules, NaHCO3 administered via solution resulted in a higher expectancy about the benefits on TTE cycling performance (Median: 3.5 vs. 2.5, Z = 2.135, p = 0.033). Decline in blood bicarbonate during exercise was higher for NaHCO3 given in solution compared to capsules (2.7 ± 2.1 mmol·L-1, p = 0.001). Mediation analyses showed that improvements in TTE cycling were indirectly related to expectancy and decline in blood bicarbonate when NaHCO3 was administered in solution but not capsules. CONCLUSIONS: Participants' higher expectations when NaHCO3 is administered in solution could result in them exerting themselves harder during TTE cycling, which subsequently leads to a greater decline in blood bicarbonate and larger improvements in performance. KEY POINTS: Ingesting 0.3 g·kg-1 body mass sodium bicarbonate in solution and capsules improved time-to-exhaustion cycling performance Positive expectancy about the benefits of sodium bicarbonate and decline in blood bicarbonate were higher when sodium bicarbonate was administered in solution compared with capsules Improvements in time-to-exhaustion cycling performance for sodium bicarbonate administered in solution were related to expectancy and the enhanced extracellular buffering response."

      "abstract": "A common occurrence in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is metabolic acidosis. Sodium bicarbonate (SB) has been widely used, but there is insufficient evidence on how SB affects neonates in NICUs with metabolic acidosis. The worsening of intracellular acidosis, the impairment of myocardial function, fluctuations in cerebral blood flow, and intracranial hemorrhage are some of the unfavorable effects of SB treatment in neonates that have been documented in the literature. This study aimed to explore neonatologists' practices for using intravenous SB (ISB) in NICUs. A multi-country survey was carried out in 2022 using an online questionnaire sent to neonatologists in various countries in order to gather information about the use of ISB in NICUs. A previously validated questionnaire was adapted and used in this study. The response rate was 67%. The findings show that 91.2% of neonatologists were using SB to correct metabolic acidosis in the NICU; 71.4% did not have written guidelines for using sodium bicarbonate. The majority of them (78.9%) reported that dosage is included in their guidelines for the use of ISB. The findings of this study emphasize the critical importance of providing guidelines in using ISB for managing metabolic acidosis in NICU to standardize procedures and reduce the use of potentially unsuitable and unsafe treatments, as it has been shown that 71.4% of neonatologists worldwide use sodium bicarbonate without guidelines.",

      "abstract": "Severe metabolic acidosis is defined by a pH < 7.2 with HCO3- < 8 mE- q/L in plasma. Its best treatment is to correct the underlying cause. However, acidemia produces multiple complications such as resistance to the action of catecholamines, pulmonary vasoconstriction, impaired cardiovascular function, hyperkalemia, immunological dysregulation, respiratory muscle fatigue, neurological impairment, cellular dysfunction, and finally, it contributes to multisystemic failure. Intravenous NaHCO3 buffers severe acidemia, preventing the associated damage and gains time while the causal disease is corrected. Its indication requires a risk-benefit assessment, considering its complications. These are hypernatremia, hypokalemia, ionic hypocalcemia, rebound alkalosis, and intracellular acidosis. For this reason, therapy must be \"adapted\" and administered judiciously. The patient will require monitoring with serial evaluation of the internal environment, especially arterial blood gases, plasma electrolytes, and ionized calcium. Isotonic solutions should be preferred instead of hypertonic bicarbonate. The development of hypernatremia must be prevented, calcium must be provided for hypocalcemia to improve cardiovascular function. Furthermore, in mechanically ventilated patients, a respiratory response similar to the one that would develop physiologically, must be established to be able to extract excess CO2 and thus avoid intracellular acidosis. It is possible to estimate the bicarbonate deficit, speed, and volume of its infusion. However, the calculations are only for reference. More important is to start intravenous NaHCO3 when needed, administer it judiciously, manage its side effects, and continue it to a safe goal. In this review we address all the necessary elements to consider in the administration of intravenous NaHCO3, highlighting why it is the best buffer for the management of severe metabolic acidosis.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Bupropion cardiotoxicity widens QRS complexes by inhibiting cardiac gap junctions. Sodium bicarbonate is the standard treatment for QRS widening from sodium channel blockade, but its effect on QRS widening in bupropion cardiotoxicity is not well-studied. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of bupropion overdoses from 10 hospitals between January 2010 and June 2022. Patients with documented administration of sodium bicarbonate and QRS duration > 100 milliseconds on pre-bicarbonate electrocardiogram were included. Patients with no electrocardiogram within four hours of treatment or with baseline pre-overdose wide QRS and < 10 milliseconds widening from baseline were excluded. The primary outcome was a change in QRS duration between the pre-bicarbonate electrocardiogram and the first electrocardiogram after initial bicarbonate administration. Secondary outcomes included prevalence of post-bicarbonate QRS < 100 milliseconds, change in electrocardiogram intervals after total bicarbonate administration, and change in metabolic parameters and hemodynamics. Wilcoxon signed-rank testing was performed on the primary outcome. Linear regression modeling was performed to test for an association between change in QRS and bicarbonate dosing. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were included for final analysis. The median age was 32 years, and 54% were male. Six patients developed seizures; one developed ventricular tachycardia, and four received vasopressors. The median QRS and QTc pre-bicarbonate were 116 and 495 milliseconds, respectively. The median change in QRS duration was -2.0 milliseconds, which was not statistically significant (P = 0.42). The median bicarbonate dose administered before the first post-bicarbonate electrocardiogram was 100 milliequivalents. We did not identify an association between QRS change and bicarbonate dosing (P = 0.9, R-squared = 0.001). No patient had a QRS duration < 100 milliseconds after the initial bicarbonate dose. There was minimal change in QTc, electrolytes, heart rate, or blood pressure; alkalemia post-bicarbonate was achieved in eight patients. CONCLUSION: Sodium bicarbonate did not significantly decrease QRS duration in this small retrospective cohort of bupropion overdoses.",

DESIGN: Investigator-initiated, parallel-group, pilot randomized double-blind trial. SETTING: Eight ICUs in Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, with participants recruited from April 2021 to August 2022. PATIENTS: Thirty patients greater than or equal to 18 years, within 48 hours of admission to the ICU, receiving a vasopressor, and with metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.30, base excess [BE] < -4 mEq/L, and Pa co2 < 45 mm Hg). INTERVENTIONS: Sodium bicarbonate or placebo (5% dextrose). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULT: The primary feasibility aim was to assess eligibility, recruitment rate, protocol compliance, and acid-base group separation. The primary clinical outcome was the number of hours alive and free of vasopressors on day 7. The recruitment rate and the enrollment-to-screening ratio were 1.9 patients per month and 0.13 patients, respectively. Time until BE correction (median difference, -45.86 [95% CI, -63.11 to -28.61] hr; p < 0.001) and pH correction (median difference, -10.69 [95% CI, -19.16 to -2.22] hr; p = 0.020) were shorter in the sodium bicarbonate group, and mean bicarbonate levels in the first 24 hours were higher (median difference, 6.50 [95% CI, 4.18 to 8.82] mmol/L; p < 0.001). Seven days after randomization, patients in the sodium bicarbonate and placebo group had a median of 132.2 (85.6-139.1) and 97.1 (69.3-132.4) hours alive and free of vasopressor, respectively (median difference, 35.07 [95% CI, -9.14 to 79.28]; p = 0.131). Recurrence of metabolic acidosis in the first 7 days of follow-up was lower in the sodium bicarbonate group (3 [20.0%] vs. 15 [100.0%]; p < 0.001). No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The findings confirm the feasibility of a larger phase III sodium bicarbonate trial; eligibility criteria may require modification to facilitate recruitment.",

      "abstract": "Background: Metabolic acidosis is a common complication in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Oral sodium bicarbonate is often used to treat metabolic acidosis and prevent CKD progression. However, there is limited information about the effect of sodium bicarbonate on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and mortality in patients with pre-dialysis advanced CKD. Method: 25599 patients with CKD stage V between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2019 were identified from the Chang Gung Research Database (CGRD), a multi-institutional electronic medical record database in Taiwan. The exposure was defined as receiving sodium bicarbonate or not. Baseline characteristics were balanced using propensity score weighting between two groups. Primary outcomes were dialysis initiation, all-cause mortality, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke). The risks of dialysis, MACE, and mortality were compared between two groups using Cox proportional hazards models. In addition, we performed analyzes using Fine and Gray sub-distribution hazard models that considered death as a competing risk. Result: Among 25599 patients with CKD stage V, 5084 patients (19.9%) were sodium bicarbonate users while 20515 (80.1%) were sodium bicarbonate non-users. The groups had similar risk of dialysis initiation (hazard ratio (HR): 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.95-1.02, p < 0.379). However, taking sodium bicarbonate was associated with a significantly lower risks of MACE (HR: 0.95, 95% CI 0.92-0.98, p < 0.001) and hospitalizations for acute pulmonary edema (HR: 0.92, 95% CI 0.88-0.96, p < 0.001) compared with non-users. The mortality risks were significantly lower in sodium bicarbonate users compared with sodium bicarbonate non-users (HR: 0.75, 95% CI 0.74-0.77, p < 0.001). Conclusion: This cohort study revealed that in real world practice, use of sodium bicarbonate was associated with similar risk of dialysis compared with non-users among patients with advanced CKD stage V. Nonetheless, use of sodium bicarbonate was associated with significantly lower rate of MACE and mortality. Findings reinforce the benefits of sodium bicarbonate therapy in the expanding CKD population. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings."

      "abstract": "SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Lower serum bicarbonate levels, even within the normal range, are strongly linked to risks of cardiovascular disease in CKD, possibly by modifying vascular function. In this randomized, controlled trial, treatment with sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3 ) did not improve vascular endothelial function or reduce arterial stiffness in participants with CKD stage 3b-4 with normal serum bicarbonate levels. In addition, NaHCO 3 treatment did not reduce left ventricular mass index. NaHCO 3 did increase plasma bicarbonate levels and urinary citrate excretion and reduce urinary ammonium excretion, indicating that the intervention was indeed effective. NaHCO 3 therapy was safe with no significant changes in BP, weight, or edema. These results do not support the use of NaHCO 3 for vascular dysfunction in participants with CKD. BACKGROUND: Lower serum bicarbonate levels, even within the normal range, are strongly linked to risks of cardiovascular disease in CKD, possibly by modifying vascular function. Prospective interventional trials with sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3 ) are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examining the effect of NaHCO 3 on vascular function in 109 patients with CKD stage 3b-4 (eGFR 15-44 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 ) with normal serum bicarbonate levels (22-27 mEq/L). Participants were randomized 1:1 to NaHCO 3 or placebo at a dose of 0.5 mEq/lean body weight-kg per day for 12 months. The coprimary end points were change in brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and change in aortic pulse wave velocity over 12 months. RESULTS: Ninety patients completed this study. After 12 months, plasma bicarbonate levels increased significantly in the NaHCO 3 group compared with placebo (mean [SD] difference between groups 1.35±2.1, P = 0.003). NaHCO 3 treatment did not result in a significant improvement in aortic pulse wave velocity from baseline. NaHCO 3 did result in a significant increase in flow-mediated dilation after 1 month; however, this effect disappeared at 6 and 12 months. NaHCO 3 resulted in a significant increase in 24-hour urine citrate and pH and a significant decrease in 24-hour urine ammonia. There was no significant change in left ventricular mass index, ejection fraction, or eGFR with NaHCO 3 . NaHCO 3 treatment was safe and well-tolerated with no significant changes in BP, antihypertensive medication, weight, plasma calcium, or potassium levels. CONCLUSION: Our results do not support the use of NaHCO 3 for vascular dysfunction in participants with CKD and normal serum bicarbonate levels.",

At mean peak blood HCO3¯, or at start of exercise an increase > 6 mmol·L-1 in HCO3¯ was noted in 84% and 52.6% participants, respectively. SB + CHO did not prevent performance decrements in WAnT bouts. There were no significant relationships between changes in blood HCO3¯ and WAnTs' performance. Total GI was significantly higher in SB + CHO compared to CTRL, and stomach problems in SB + CHO compared to CTRL and PLA + CHO. There were inverse associations between peak- (p = 0.031; r = - 0.495), average- (p = 0.002; r = - 0.674) and minimum power (p = 0.008; r = - 0.585) and total GI upset, as well as average power and severe GI distress (p = 0.042; r = - 0.471) at SB + CHO. The implemented dose of SB + CHO was effective in improving buffering capacity, but did not prevent decrements in WAnTs' performance. GI side effects were crucial in affecting the ergogenic potential of SB and thus must be insightfully monitored in future studies.",

BRS does not increase the liver burden, but its impact in liver transplantation is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of BRS as a fluid therapy on intraoperative blood gas analysis and postoperative recovery time in orthotopic liver transplantation (LT) patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 101 patients who received classical in situ liver transplantation at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University from November 2019 to January 2022. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the intraoperative fluid infusion: the BRS group and the sodium lactate Ringer's solution group (LRS group). Intraoperative blood gas analysis, including pH, base excess (BE), bicarbonate, and lactic acid levels of radial artery blood, were collected after induction (T0), 30 min before opening (T1), 30 min after no liver period (T2), 30 min after opening (T3), and at the end of the operation (T4). Postoperative ICU catheter time, ICU stay time, and total hospitalization days were also recorded and compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS Lactic acid levels were decreased significantly at T3 in the BRS group (P<0.05). ICU catheter time, ICU hospitalization days, and total hospitalization days were significantly shorter in the BRS group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS BRS can decrease the lactic acid level at 30 min after opening, reducing the postoperative recovery time. BRS is more effective than LRS in liver transplantation.",

The incidence of CIN is higher in emergency than elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) because there is no established method to prevent CIN. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether bolus administration of a concentrated solution of sodium bicarbonate can prevent CIN in patients undergoing emergency PCI. Methods and Results: This multicenter prospective single-arm trial with historical controls will include patients who are aged ≥20 years and will undergo cardiac catheterization for suspected acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Patients will receive an intravenous bolus administration of concentrated sodium bicarbonate solution (7% or 8.4%, 20 mEq) and will be observed for 72±12 h. Data for the control group, comprising all patients who underwent PCI for AMI between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 across participating hospitals, will be extracted. The primary endpoint is the incidence of CIN, defined as an increase in serum creatinine of >0.5 mg/dL or >25% from baseline within 48±12 h. We will evaluate the endpoints in the prospective group and compare them with those in the historical control group. Conclusions: This study will evaluate whether a single bolus administration of concentrated sodium bicarbonate can prevent CIN after emergency PCI."

The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of nasal irrigation and oral rinse with sodium bicarbonate solution on virus clearance among COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: COVID-19 patients were recruited and randomly divided into two group, i.e., the experimental group and the control group. The experimental group received regular care plus nasal irrigation and oral rinse with 5% sodium bicarbonate solution, while the control group only received regular care. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples were collected daily for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. The negative conversion time and hospitalization time of the patients were recorded, and the results were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 55 COVID-19 patients with mild or moderate symptoms were included in our study. There was no significant difference in gender, age and health status between the two groups. The average negative conversion time was 1.63 days after treatment with sodium bicarbonate, and the average hospitalization time of the control group and the experimental group were 12.53 and 7.7 days, respectively.

The physicochemical properties of fermented rice flour and quality characteristics of fermented semi-dried rice noodles were investigated in this study in relation to the addition of sodium bicarbonate (0∼0.5%, w/w). With the increase of sodium bicarbonate addition, the pH value was increased, and lipid and protein content were decreased in rice flour. Meanwhile, thermal properties and farinograph properties showed that the pasting temperature, dough water absorption, dough development time and dough stability time of rice flour increased with the addition of sodium bicarbonate. Pasting properties and rheological properties results showed that a small amount of sodium bicarbonate (0∼0.1%) could increase the pasting viscosity, storage modulus (G'), and loss modulus (G″) of rice flour. Additionally, the hardness and chewiness of semi-dried rice noodles increased with the addition of sodium bicarbonate from 0 to 0.1%. With the addition of a small amount of sodium bicarbonate (0∼0.1%), x-ray diffraction showed that it could increase the crystallinity of semi-dried rice noodles. Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance showed that A21 increased, and A22 and A23 decreased in semi-dried rice noodles. Scanning electron microscope showed that it could enhance the starch-protein interaction and starch-protein formed an ordered and stable network structure. Finally, the principal component analysis showed that the chewiness, texture and eating quality of semi-dried rice noodles were the best with the addition of sodium bicarbonate at 0.1%. This study provides practical value for the application of alkali treatment in rice products and provides a reference for the improvement of related rice noodles products."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the first-line therapy for gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD). Unlike conventional PPIs, non-enteric coated PPIs with antacid salt enable a faster acid suppression through the rapid absorption of the PPI. YPI-011 is a newly developed fixed-dose combination of a rabeprazole with sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). This study compared the pharmacokinetics (PKs) and pharmacodynamics (PDs) of YPI-011 to the conventional enteric-coated rabeprazole (Pariet®). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized, open-label, two-treatment, two-sequence crossover study was conducted with two different doses (10 and 20 mg) and 44 subjects in each group. They randomly received either a test or reference treatment for 7 days in the first period and the other treatment in the second period. Blood samples for the PK analysis were taken after the single- and multiple-dose. Intragastric pH monitoring for the PD analysis was implemented for baseline and after the single- and multiple-dose. RESULTS: Gastric acid suppression evaluated by the percentage decrease from baseline in the integrated gastric acidity for a 24-hour interval after the multiple-dose was similar between the treatments in both dose groups. The systemic exposure of rabeprazole at steady state after the multiple-dose was also similar between the treatments in both dose groups. The time to reach the maximum rabeprazole concentration was faster in the test treatment. The PK-PD relationship of PPI is well known, and the faster absorption of rabeprazole resulted in a more rapid mode of action in acid suppression. CONCLUSION: The fixed dose combination of rabeprazole with NaHCO3 showed a faster absorption and consequently, a more rapid gastric acid suppression with a similar systemic exposure of rabeprazole at steady state compared to the conventional enteric-coated rabeprazole.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Individuals with CKD are at a higher risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Acidosis is positively correlated with CKD progression and elevated systolic BP. Sodium bicarbonate is an efficacious treatment of acidosis, although this may also increase systolic BP. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we summarize the evidence evaluating systolic BP and antihypertensive medication change (which may indicate systolic BP change) in response to sodium bicarbonate therapy in individuals with CKD. METHODS: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Excerpta Medica database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and World Health Organization (WHO) trials registry databases were searched for randomized control trials where sodium bicarbonate was compared with placebo/usual care in CKD stage G1-5 non-dialysis-dependent populations. Random effects meta-analyses were used to evaluate changes in systolic BP and BP-modifying drugs after sodium bicarbonate intervention. RESULTS: Fourteen randomized control trials (2110 individuals, median follow-up 27 [interquartile range 97] weeks, mean age 60 [SD 10] years, mean systolic BP 136 [SD 17] mm Hg, mean eGFR 38 [SD 10] ml/min, mean serum bicarbonate 22 [SD 4] mmol/L) were eligible for inclusion. Meta-analysis suggested that sodium bicarbonate did not influence systolic BP in individuals with CKD stage G1-5. Results were consistent when stratifying by dose of sodium bicarbonate or duration of intervention. Similarly, there was no significant increase in the use of antihypertensive medication or diuretics in individuals taking sodium bicarbonate, whereas there was a greater decrease in antihypertensive medication use in individuals taking sodium bicarbonate compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest, with moderate certainty, that sodium bicarbonate supplementation does not adversely affect systolic BP in CKD or negatively influence antihypertensive medication requirements.",

Optimal growth conditions for A. niger were 30°C, pH 5.0-6.0, and fructose and peptone as carbon and nitrogen sources. The effects of sodium bicarbonate (SBC), natamycin (NT), and combined treatments on A. niger inhibition were investigated. Treatment with 4.0 g/L sodium bicarbonate (SBC) + 5.0 mg/L natamycin (NT) inhibited mycelial growth and spore germination as completely as 12.0 mg/L SBC or 25.0 mg/L NT. SBC and NT treatments disrupted the structural integrity of cell and mitochondria membranes and decreased enzyme activities involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), ATP production in mitochondria, and ergosterol content in the plasma membrane, thus leading to the inhibition of A. niger growth. Moreover, experimental results in vivo showed that the rot lesion diameter and decay rate of Shengzhou nane fruit treated with SBC and NT were significantly reduced compared with the control. The results suggest that the combination treatment of SBC and NT could be an alternative to synthetic fungicides for controlling postharvest Shengzhou nane decay caused by A. niger."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Metabolic acidosis is common in kidney transplant recipients and is associated with declining graft function. Sodium bicarbonate treatment effectively corrects metabolic acidosis, but no prospective studies have examined its effect on graft function. Therefore, we aimed to test whether sodium bicarbonate treatment would preserve graft function and slow the progression of estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline in kidney transplant recipients. METHODS: The Preserve-Transplant Study was a multicentre, randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial at three University Hospitals in Switzerland (Zurich, Bern, and Geneva), which recruited adult (aged ≥18 years) male and female long-term kidney transplant recipients if they had undergone transplantation more than 1 year ago. Key inclusion criteria were an estimated GFR between 15 mL/min per 1·73 m2 and 89 mL/min per 1·73 m2, stable allograft function in the last 6 months before study inclusion (<15% change in serum creatinine), and a serum bicarbonate of 22 mmol/L or less. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) to either oral sodium bicarbonate 1·5-4·5 g per day or matching placebo using web-based data management software. Randomisation was stratified by study centre and gender using a permuted block design to guarantee balanced allocation. We did multi-block randomisation with variable block sizes of two and four. Treatment duration was 2 years. Acid-resistant soft gelatine capsules of 500 mg sodium bicarbonate or matching 500 mg placebo capsules were given at an initial dose of 500 mg (if bodyweight was <70 kg) or 1000 mg (if bodyweight was ≥70 kg) three times daily. The primary endpoint was the estimated GFR slope over the 24-month treatment phase. The primary efficacy analyses were applied to a modified intention-to-treat population that comprised all randomly assigned participants who had a baseline visit. The safety population comprised all participants who received at least one dose of study drug. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03102996. FINDINGS: Between June 12, 2017, and July 10, 2019, 1114 kidney transplant recipients with metabolic acidosis were assessed for trial eligibility. 872 patients were excluded and 242 were randomly assigned to the study groups (122 [50%] to the placebo group and 120 [50%] to the sodium bicarbonate group). After secondary exclusion of two patients, 240 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The calculated yearly estimated GFR slopes over the 2-year treatment period were a median -0·722 mL/min per 1·73 m2 (IQR -4·081 to 1·440) and mean -1·862 mL/min per 1·73 m2 (SD 6·344) per year in the placebo group versus median -1·413 mL/min per 1·73 m2 (IQR -4·503 to 1·139) and mean -1·830 mL/min per 1·73 m2 (SD 6·233) per year in the sodium bicarbonate group (Wilcoxon rank sum test p=0·51; Welch t-test p=0·97). The mean difference was 0·032 mL/min per 1·73 m2 per year (95% CI -1·644 to 1·707). There were no significant differences in estimated GFR slopes in a subgroup analysis and a sensitivity analysis confirmed the primary analysis. Although the estimated GFR slope did not show a significant difference between the treatment groups, treatment with sodium bicarbonate effectively corrected metabolic acidosis by increasing serum bicarbonate from 21·3 mmol/L (SD 2·6) to 23·0 mmol/L (2·7) and blood pH from 7·37 (SD 0·06) to 7·39 (0·04) over the 2-year treatment period. Adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in both groups. Three study participants died. In the placebo group, one (1%) patient died from acute respiratory distress syndrome due to SARS-CoV-2 and one (1%) from cardiac arrest after severe dehydration following diarrhoea with hypotension, acute kidney injury, and metabolic acidosis. In the sodium bicarbonate group, one (1%) patient had sudden cardiac death. INTERPRETATION: In adult kidney transplant recipients, correction of metabolic acidosis by treatment with sodium bicarbonate over 2 years did not affect the decline in estimated GFR. Thus, treatment with sodium bicarbonate should not be generally recommended to preserve estimated GFR (a surrogate marker for graft function) in kidney transplant recipients with chronic kidney disease who have metabolic acidosis.

      "abstract": "Objective: This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of sodium bicarbonate (SB) administration on mortality in septic patients with acute moderate lactic acidosis (MLA). Methods: The large ICU database (MIMIC-IV) was retrospectively analyzed. Patients with sepsis and acute MLA were identified. Propensity score analysis (PSA) was performed to explain baseline differences in the probability of accepting or not accepting SB. The edge structured cox model (MSCM) was used to adjust for baseline and time-varying confounding variables. The primary outcome was the ICU and hospital mortality. The subgroup of septic shock was also investigated. Results: A total of 512 septic patients with acute MLA were identified in this study, including 160 in the SB group and 352 in the non-SB group. In the PSA, SB administration was associated with reduced ICU (HR .58, 95% CI 0.38-.89; p <.05) and hospital (HR .67, 95% CI 0.47-.95; p <.05) mortality in septic patients with acute MLA. In the subgroup, the results were similar with septic patients. In the MSCM, SB administration could also improve the ICU (HR .35, 95% CI 0.16-.75; p <.01) and (HR .50, 95% CI 0.28-.88; p <.05) mortality on septic patients. However, In the subgroup, SB administration could only be found associated with improved hospital (HR .44, 95% CI 0.20-.97; p <.05) survival in septic shock. Conclusion: SB administration treatment could reduce ICU and hospital mortality of septic patients with acute MLA. Meanwhile, it could also improve hospital survival in the subgroup of septic shock patients with acute MLA."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Oral mucositis (OM) is a major side effect of cancer therapy, which is associated with significant symptoms, treatment delays and increased costs for the health system. It is an important component of the quality of life of cancer patients and, until now, there has been no gold standard regarding prevention or treatment of this pathology. Notwithstanding the paucity of treatment guidelines (due to limited evidence from high-quality, rigorous studies), sodium bicarbonate (SB) rinses are one of the most used agents for OM management. OBJECTIVES: A systematic review (2000-2022) was performed in order to compare and examine different agents versus sodium bicarbonate (SB) in preventing or treating OM. SOURCES: Eleven randomized controlled trials (RCT) were evaluated: four were conducted for the prevention and seven for the management of OM. The risk of bias of RCTs was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials. STUDY SELECTION: According to the RoB2 evaluation for randomized trials, four RCTs were judged to be at a high risk of bias, two were rated as 'problematic', while five were deemed to be a low risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed that there was no evidence for supporting SB in OM treatment regarding management and prevention. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Results showed in this review takes on a strategic importance in the use of SB for OM management or prevention; indiscriminate use of SB could be counterproductive because it causes a sudden pH increase and it delays proper OM pharmacological treatment.",

METHODS: Our prospective cohort study included 40 patients with complicated empyema; the diagnosis was based on analysis of aspirated fluid in association with radiological and bacteriological culture. The patients were subjected to instillation of two different fibrinolytic agents; the first one was NaHCO3, the second was urokinase. RESULTS: The commonest underlying chest infection that was visualized by CT was pneumonia 70%. Nearly half of cases had community-acquired infection (45%), and more than half of them (55%) had anaerobic infection, and only five cases had TB pleural effusion based on ADA-positive, tuberculin skin test in addition to Abram's needles closed biopsy. The rate of repeated therapeutic thoracentesis success in each group was 85%; 80% in NaHCO3 group, and 90% in urokinase group, both of them was significantly equal, P=0.37. Moreover, the frequency of complications in all patients was less than 13%, hence hemothorax and iatrogenic pneumothorax was 12.5%, and only 10% of cases were admitted in ICU after the maneuver, with insignificant difference in between the groups. However, looking at the smaller rate of RTT failure of NaHCO3 or urokinase, the logistic regression model showed that RTT-NaHCO3 was insignificantly related to failure in both unadjusted and adjusted models, P=0.37 and 0.32, respectively, and only smoking habits increase the likelihood of failure 9-fold (OR=8.9, P=0.04) with respect to age, sex, and treatment methods. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of repeated therapeutic thoracentesis (RTT) with intrapleural instillation of NaHCO3 was effective and safe, the same as urokinase, with consideration that NaHCO3 was much more available and affordable than urokinase."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sleep is fundamental to a healthy life, and sleep disorders are an important health issue in healthcare. Whole-body warm water bathing is a non-pharmacological, safe (non-invasive), and widely used method for comforting. Here, we explored the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of sodium bicarbonate bath (SBB) on sleep quality. METHODS: Healthy adults without sleep disturbances were randomly assigned to shower baths (SHB), tap-water baths (TWB, placebo tablets), or SBB. All participants took a bath (shower, tap-water, or SBB) once a day for 10 min, after dinner, for 7 days. Sleepscan-derived sleep parameters, including total sleep time (TST), symptom questionnaires, and salivary α-amylase concentration were evaluated as outcome measures. RESULTS: Forty participants were enrolled (14, 13, and 13 in SHB, TWB, and SBB groups, respectively) and 38 participants completed the trial (13, 12, and 13, respectively). The recruitment, adherence, and completion rates were 90.9% (40/44), 95.0% (38/40), and 95.0% (38/40), respectively. The SBB group showed a significant increase (12.35 [mean]±10.07 [standard deviation] min) in the mean TST at 1-week post-intervention (p = 0.0041) than the SHB (-1.81 ± 14.58 min; p = 0.0231) and TWB (4.54 ± 10.97 min; p = 0.0377) groups. The TST scores at 1-week post-intervention, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, and sleep efficiency were significantly different between the groups. Sleep satisfaction by questionnaire was significantly improved with intervention in the SBB group than that in the SHB and TWB groups. Salivary α-amylase levels significantly improved in the SBB and TWB groups than in the SHB group, with the change being greater in the SBB group. CONCLUSIONS: SBB for 7 days had positive effects that improved sleep quality of adults. Further studies are needed to examine the efficacy and safety of SBB for prolonged usage in people diagnosed with insomnia, using objective sleep measurements, and to investigate potential sleep-enhancing mechanisms of action.",

Intravenous-lipid-emulsion (ILE) therapy during LA intoxication seems to act as an antidote. Sodium bicarbonate is the standard treatment for sodium channel blocker drug toxicity. We compared both antidotes on the reversion of electrophysiologic toxicity induced by ropivacaine. Ropivacaine 5 mg kg-1 was administered in 24 pigs, and 3 min later, the animals received ILE: 1.5 ml kg-1  + 0.25 ml kg-1  min-1 (ILE group); sodium bicarbonate: 2 mEq kg-1  + 1 mEq kg-1  h-1 (NaHCO3 group); saline solution (CTL group). Electrophysiological parameters were evaluated for 30 min. The area under the curve (AUC) for the first 5 or 30 min was compared between groups. Ropivacaine induced a lengthening of the PR interval by 17% (P = 0.0001), His-ventricle-interval by 58% (P = 0.001), sinus QRS complex by 56% (P = 0.0001), paced QRS at 150 bpm by 257% (P = 0.0001), and at 120 bpm by 143% (P = 0.0001) in all groups. At 5 min after treatment, sinus QRS in the NaHCO3 group was shorter than that in the CTL group (AUCQRS5 , P = 0.003) or ILE group (AUCQRS5 , P = 0.045). During the first minute, seven of the animals in the NaHCO3 group vs. two in the ILE or 0 in the CTL group recovered more than 30% of the sinus QRS previously lengthened by ropivacaine (P = 0.003).

      "abstract": "Resuscitations in neonates and infants present caregivers with challenging decisions in a highly stressful environment. Consideration of the pathophysiology of cardiac arrest and respiratory failure prior to an emergency allows for thoughtful utilization of pharmacotherapy. It is vital to remember that establishment of an airway and delivery of breaths and chest compressions should be prioritized. Epinephrine is first-line pharmacotherapy for severe bradycardia or cardiac arrest unresponsive to the provision of respiratory support and chest compressions. Sodium bicarbonate may be considered based on the intrinsic links between cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, and mixed acidosis. However, experimental and clinical data suggest that sodium bicarbonate worsens myocardial performance by several mechanisms (decreased intramyocardial pH, reduced oxygen delivery to tissues, reduced coronary perfusion pressure). Additionally, rapid administration of this hyperosmolar therapy may contribute to intracranial hemorrhage. With no clear benefit and multiple risks, sodium bicarbonate has been excluded from neonatal resuscitation algorithms. Opioids may produce respiratory depression in neonates, whether given to the mother prior to delivery or in neonatal intensive care; therefore, naloxone may be considered to restore respiratory drive. However, 50 years of neonatal utilization has not produced clinical studies documenting efficacy and safety. On the contrary, clinical studies fail to detect clear benefit and numerous concerning adverse reactions have been reported, including acute withdrawal, cardiorespiratory decompensation, and death. For these reasons, naloxone has also been removed from neonatal resuscitation algorithms. Clear understanding of pathophysiology, pharmacology, and clinical data support the use of multiple pharmacotherapies in neonatal resuscitation, including epinephrine, normal saline, intravenous glucose, adenosine, and calcium gluconate as reviewed in a previous column. The same pathways inform confident exclusion of sodium bicarbonate and naloxone.",

      "abstract": "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains pose major treatment challenges due to their innate resistance to most β-lactams under standard in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing conditions. A novel phenotype among MRSA, termed \"NaHCO3 responsiveness,\" where certain strains display increased susceptibility to β-lactams in the presence of NaHCO3, has been identified among a relatively large proportion of MRSA isolates. One underlying mechanism of NaHCO3 responsiveness appears to be related to decreased expression and altered functionality of several genes and proteins involved in cell wall synthesis and maturation. Here, we studied the impact of NaHCO3 on wall teichoic acid (WTA) synthesis, a process intimately linked to peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis and functionality, in NaHCO3-responsive versus -nonresponsive MRSA isolates. NaHCO3 sensitized responsive MRSA strains to cefuroxime, a specific penicillin-binding protein 2 (PBP2)-inhibitory β-lactam known to synergize with early WTA synthesis inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine). Combining cefuroxime with ticlopidine with or without NaHCO3 suggested that these latter two agents target the same step in WTA synthesis. Further, NaHCO3 decreased the abundance and molecular weight of WTA only in responsive strains. Additionally, NaHCO3 stimulated increased autolysis and aberrant cell division in responsive strains, two phenotypes associated with disruption of WTA synthesis. Of note, studies of key genes involved in the WTA biosynthetic pathway (e.g., tarO, tarG, dltA, and fmtA) indicated that the inhibitory impact of NaHCO3 on WTA biosynthesis in responsive strains likely occurred posttranslationally. IMPORTANCE MRSA is generally viewed as resistant to standard β-lactam antibiotics. However, a NaHCO3-responsive phenotype is observed in a substantial proportion of clinical MRSA strains in vitro, i.e., isolates which demonstrate enhanced susceptibility to standard β-lactam antibiotics (e.g., oxacillin) in the presence of NaHCO3. This phenotype correlates with increased MRSA clearance in vivo by standard β-lactam antibiotics, suggesting that patients with infections caused by such MRSA strains might be amenable to treatment with β-lactams. The mechanism(s) behind this phenotype is not fully understood but appears to involve mecA-PBP2a production and maturation axes. Our study adds significantly to this body of knowledge in terms of additional mechanistic targets of NaHCO3 in selected MRSA strains. This investigation demonstrates that NaHCO3 has direct impacts on S. aureus wall teichoic acid biosynthesis in NaHCO3-responsive MRSA. These findings provide an additional target for new agents being designed to synergistically kill MRSA using β-lactam antibiotics.",

To reduce the risk of toxicity, supportive measures, including hydration and alkalinization, are recommended. At our institution, we switched from intravenous sodium bicarbonate to Lactated Ringers during a worldwide shortage. PROCEDURE: This was a retrospective cohort of children who received high-dose methotrexate from January 1, 2016 to August 31, 2018. The primary outcome was the prevalence of delayed methotrexate clearance. Secondary outcomes were proportion of cycles with delayed methotrexate clearance, time to methotrexate clearance, adverse events, risk factors for delayed clearance, and association between hydration type and delayed clearance. RESULTS: Eighty-two patients, with a total of 325 methotrexate cycles, were included. Forty-four patients received sodium bicarbonate, 31 received Lactated Ringers, and 7 received both. There was no difference in the prevalence of delayed methotrexate clearance between those who received sodium bicarbonate and Lactated Ringers (64% vs. 68%). The proportion of cycles with delayed methotrexate clearance, time to methotrexate clearance, and adverse events were similar between groups. Cancer type, methotrexate dose, and vomiting were associated with delayed clearance. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that Lactated Ringers may be used in place of sodium bicarbonate for intravenous hydration during high-dose methotrexate.",

Sodium bicarbonate Ringer's solution is a new type of crystalloid solution that has been recently used in the clinical setting. Whether sodium bicarbonate Ringer's solution reduces the occurrence of postoperative AKI and improves the clinical outcomes of liver transplantation patients is not clear. Objective: To compare the effects of sodium bicarbonate Ringer's solution versus normal saline on acute kidney injury and clinical outcomes following classic orthotopic liver transplantation. Methods: Sixty-four participants were randomly assigned to the sodium bicarbonate Ringers (BRS) group or the normal saline (NS) group. The primary outcomes were the incidence and severity of acute kidney injury after liver transplantation. The secondary outcomes included the rate of renal replacement therapy, length of mechanical ventilation, stay in the ICU, stay in the hospital after surgery and 30-day mortality. Other outcomes included the concentration of sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, anion gap, lactate concentration and changes in chloride preoperatively and postoperatively. Result: Sixty-two patients completed the trial and were analyzed, with 31 patients in each group. There was a significantly lower rate of postoperative acute kidney injury in the BRS group (14/31, 45.2%) than in the NS group (24/31, 77.4%), with a relative risk of 0.58 (95% CI, 0.38-0.90; p = 0.009). The severity of AKI in the BRS group was lower than that in the NS group (Z = -2.932, p = 0.003). There was no significant difference observed in the secondary outcomes. For other outcomes, the concentration of preoperative sodium was lower than postoperative sodium in the NS group (137.2 vs. 140.4, p = 0.009). The concentration of preoperative chloride was lower than that of postoperative chloride in the NS group (102.9 vs. 106.2, p < 0.001). The change in the concentration of chloride in the BRS group was lower than that in the NS group (1.6 vs. 4.7, p = 0.006).

METHODS: This single center, retrospective study included 34 patients supported on IMP5.5 with BIV based AC and SBPS between December 1st 2020 to December 1st 2021.The efficacy and safety end points were incidence of development of HIT, Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) use for suspected pump thrombosis, stroke, and device failure as well as clinically significant bleeding. RESULTS: The median duration of IMP5.5 support was 9.8 days (IQR: 6-15). Most patients were bridged to HTX (58%) followed by recovery (27%) and LVAD implantation (15%). Patients were therapeutic on bivalirudin for 64% of their IMP5.5 support. One patient (2.9%) suffered from ischemic stroke and 26.5% (9) patients developed clinically significant bleeding. tPA was administered to 7(21%) patients. One patient in the entire cohort developed HIT. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience supports the use of systemic BIV and SBPS as a method to avoid heparin exposure in a patient population predisposed to the development of HIT.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Traumatic hemorrhagic shock (THS) is the main cause of death in trauma patients with high mortality. Rapid control of the source of bleeding and early resuscitation are crucial to clinical treatment. Guidelines recommend isotonic crystal resuscitation when blood products are not immediately available. However, the selection of isotonic crystals has been controversial. Sodium bicarbonate Ringer solutions (BRS), containing sodium bicarbonate, electrolyte levels, and osmotic pressures closer to plasma, are ideal. Therefore, in this study, we will focus on the effects of BRS on the first 6 h of resuscitation, complications, and 7-day survival in patients with THS. METHODS: /design. This single-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial will focus on the efficacy and safety of BRS in early THS resuscitation. A total of 400 adults THS patients will be enrolled in this study. In addition to providing standard care, enrolled patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive resuscitation with BRS (test group) or sodium lactate Ringer's solution (control group) until successful resuscitation from THS. Lactate clearance at different time points (0.5, 1, 1.5, 3, and 6 h) and shock duration after drug administration will be compared between the two groups as primary end points. Secondary end points will compare coagulation function, temperature, acidosis, inflammatory mediator levels, recurrence of shock, complications, medication use, and 7-day mortality between the two groups. Patients will be followed up until discharge or 7 days after discharge. DISCUSSION: At present, there are still great differences in the selection of resuscitation fluids, and there is a lack of systematic and detailed studies to compare and observe the effects of various resuscitation fluids on the effectiveness and safety of early resuscitation in THS patients. This trial will provide important clinical data for resuscitation fluid selection and exploration of safe dose of BRS in THS patients.

Enhanced sodium bicarbonate cotransporter (NBC) activity is caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in ventricular myocytes. Thus, we hypothesized that cardioplegia-solution-mediated ROS generation may be involved in the regulation of NBC activity in cardiomyocytes and that oh8dG treatment may modulate ROS and associated NBC activity. Langendorff-free cardioplegia-arrested cardiac strips and cardiomyocytes were isolated to determine the NBC activity and effects of oh8dG on oxidative-stress-mediated cardiac damage markers. We first determined the histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution mediated NBC activity in cardiac strips and cells. The oh8dG treatment attenuated NBC activity in the electroneutral or electrogenic form of NBC. Additionally, exposure to HTK solution induced ROS, whereas co-administration of oh8dG attenuated ROS-mediated NBC activity, reduced ROS levels, and decreased the expression of apoptotic markers and fibrosis-associated proteins in cardiac cells. The oh8dG-administrated cardiac tissues were also protected from enhanced HTK-induced damage markers, heat shock protein 60 and polyADP-ribose. Our results show that oh8dG has a protective role against myocardial oxidative damage and provides a useful treatment strategy for restoring cardiac function."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the antigingivitis and antiplaque treatment effect of a toothpaste containing 67% w/w sodium bicarbonate, at the individual tooth site, tooth region and whole mouth (overall) level, by way of a pooled analysis of data from similarly designed clinical trials. METHODS: Six randomized controlled GSKCH clinical trials, 12-24 weeks in duration, were selected based on pre-specified criteria which included access to patient level data, pre-treatment dental prophylaxis, >20 bleeding sites and mild-moderate gingivitis at screening and use of 67% sodium bicarbonate toothpaste and non-sodium bicarbonate (regular) toothpaste (negative control) for ≥4 weeks. Efficacy outcomes comprised plaque index (TPI), modified gingival index (MGI) and gingival bleeding (bleeding index (BI), number of bleeding sites (BS)). Treatment comparisons were made using ANCOVA for whole mouth (overall) scores and by tooth site region (facial overall, lingual overall; margin/body overall, facial margin/body, lingual margin/body; papillae/interproximal overall, facial papillae/interproximal, lingual papillae/interproximal). Pooled data for BI, MGI, and TPI at individual tooth sites was plotted as a mouthmap to summarize treatment response (change from baseline) by tooth site, at the 24-week timepoint. RESULTS: For all measures, whole mouth and for all tooth regions at all post-treatment timepoints, significant (p < 0.001) differences in favour of the 67% sodium bicarbonate toothpaste compared with control were observed. At the 24-week timepoint, facial regions demonstrated greater improvements than lingual regions, with the greatest between treatment improvement seen for the facial-papillae regions for bleeding (BS/BI), facial-margin regions for MGI and facial-body regions for TPI. All individual tooth sites demonstrated numerically greater reductions from baseline for the 67% sodium bicarbonate toothpaste than the control toothpaste following 24 weeks use, with the greatest improvements (change from baseline) seen for posterior and papillae tooth sites for bleeding, margin tooth sites for MGI and body tooth sites for TPI. CONCLUSION: This pooled analysis of patient level-data, limited to GSKCH long-term gingivitis clinical studies, demonstrates that twice daily use of a 67% sodium bicarbonate toothpaste effectively removes plaque from all tooth sites, and results in clinically significant improvements in measures of gingival health, overall and for all the tooth regions investigated, compared with a non-sodium bicarbonate (regular) toothpaste following 24 weeks twice daily use.",

      "abstract": "The study was carried out to evaluate the effect of sodium bicarbonate (SB) supplementation in diets and compare its chemical effect with the fiber effect of soybean hulls on performance, nutritional behavior, and carcass characteristics of feedlot lambs. Twenty-eight ram lambs (Dorper × Santa Inês), with an initial body weight of 30.2 ± 4.5 kg and 94 ± 8.4 days old, were used. They were assigned to a randomized complete block design, defined by initial age and body weight. Experimental diets were positive control, diet containing soybean hulls in 400 g/kg dry matter (DM) (CONT), and three diets based on ground flint corn containing 10 (10SB), 20 (20SB), or 30 (30SB) g/kg DM of SB. Among the SB levels, the buffer supplementation quadratically increased dry matter intake, average daily gain, feed efficiency, as well as increased final and slaughter body weight, which led to higher hot and cold carcass weights, loin muscle area, leg compacity index, and weight of neck, shoulder, rib, and leg cuts, with higher values for the 20SB. Feeding SB linearly decreased the area and height of the papillae. None of the animals presented liver abscess; however, two animals from 30SB and one from CONT had F-rumen lesions. The use of SB provided a similar animal performance when compared to the treatment containing soybean hulls. This shows that the chemical effect of the buffer was efficient and provided greater safety for this type of diet without causing damages to the rumen health. Among the SB levels, the best results were observed in the 20 g/kg level (20SB), which shows that the buffer can be used as a strategy for diets with high inclusion of corn and no fiber source.",

The pH, salt-soluble proteins solubility, cooking yield, and b* values of reduced-salt pork batters significantly increased (P < 0.05) with the increase in ultrasound time and the addition of sodium bicarbonate, leading to the hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, and chewiness significantly increased (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the use of ultrasound-assisted sodium bicarbonate treatment caused the reduced-salt pork batters to form a typical spongy structure with more evenly cavities. Due to the initial relaxation time of T21 and T22 were shorter, and the peak ratio of P21 was increased and P22 was decreased after ultrasound-assisted sodium bicarbonate treatment, implying that the mobility of water was reduced. Thus, the use of ultrasound-assisted sodium bicarbonate treatment enabled reduced-salt pork batters to have better gel characteristics and higher cooking yield.",

In this multi-study project, we aimed to determine the most efficacious ingestion strategy for blinding NaHCO3 research. During study one, 16 physically active adults tasted 0.3 g kg-1 body mass NaHCO3 or 0.03 g kg-1 body mass sodium chloride placebo treatments given in different flavour (orange, blackcurrant) and temperature (chilled, room temperature) solutions. They were required to guess which treatment they had received. During study two, 12 recreational athletes performed time-to-exhaustion (TTE) cycling trials (familiarisation, four experimental). Using a randomised, double-blind design, participants consumed 0.3 g kg-1 body mass NaHCO3 or a placebo in 5 mL kg-1 body mass chilled orange squash/water solutions or capsules and indicated what they believed they had received immediately after consumption, pre-TTE and post-TTE. In study one, NaHCO3 prepared in chilled orange squash resulted in the most unsure ratings (44%). In study two, giving NaHCO3 in capsules resulted in more unsure ratings than in solution after consumption (92 vs 33%), pre-TTE (67 vs. 17%) and post-TTE (50 vs. 17%). Administering NaHCO3 in capsules was the most efficacious blinding strategy which provides important implications for researchers conducting randomised placebo-controlled trials.",

Four concentrations of SBC (0.5, 2, 3.5, and 5%) were tested. Results showed that bacterial antagonists displayed remarkable compatibility with different concentrations of SBC and that their viability was not affected. The results obtained in vitro and in vivo bioassays showed a strong inhibitory effect of all treatments. The combination of each bacterial antagonist with SBC revealed a significant improvement in their biocontrol efficacies. The inhibition rates of mycelial growth ranged from 60.97 to 100%. These results also indicated that bacterial antagonists (SF14 or ACBC1) used at 1 × 108 CFU/ mL in combination with 2, 3.5, or 5% SBC significantly improved the control of M. fructigina by inhibiting the germination of spores. Interestingly, disease incidence and lesion diameter in fruits treated with SF14, ACBC1 alone, or in combination with SBC were significantly lower than those in the untreated fruits. In vivo results showed a significant reduction in disease severity ranging from 9.27 to 64.83% compared to the untreated control, while maintaining the appearance, firmness, total soluble solids (TSS), and titratable acidity (TA) of fruits. These results suggested that the improved disease control by the two antagonistic bacteria was more likely due to the additional inhibitory effects of SBC on the mycelial growth and spore germination of the pathogenic fungus. Overall, the combination of both bacteria with SBC provided better control of brown rot disease. Therefore, a mixture of different management strategies can effectively control brown rot decay on fruits."

The aim of this study was to comparatively evaluate the efficacy and safety of esomeprazole with sodium bicarbonate and esomeprazole alone. METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, noninferiority comparative study. A total of 379 patients with NERD were randomly allocated to receive either EsoduoⓇ (esomeprazole 20 mg with sodium bicarbonate 800 mg) or NexiumⓇ (esomeprazole 20 mg) once daily for 4 weeks from January 2019 to December 2019. The patients had a history of heartburn for at least 2 days in the week before randomization as well as in the last 3 months and no esophageal mucosal breaks on endoscopy. The primary endpoint was a complete cure of heartburn at week 4. The secondary and exploratory endpoints as well as the safety profiles were compared in the groups at weeks 2 and 4. RESULTS: A total of 355 patients completed the study (180 in the EsoduoⓇ group and 175 in the NexiumⓇ group). The proportions of patients without heartburn in the entire 4th week of treatment were not different between the two groups (33.33% in the EsoduoⓇ group and 35% in the NexiumⓇ group, p=0.737). There were no significant differences in most of the secondary and exploratory endpoints as well as the safety profiles.

Therefore, this study aimed to verify the decontaminating action of the sodium bicarbonate jet in vitro, using different protocols, and the presence of visible changes on the surface of dental implants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen titanium implants (BioHE, Bioconnect) were used, divided into four groups (four implants per group): sterile implants (S)-negative control; implants contaminated with oral biofilm (C)-positive control; and implants contaminated with oral biofilm and decontaminated with a sodium bicarbonate jet for 30 seconds (J30) or 60 seconds (J60). The implants of groups C, J30, and J60 were contaminated in vitro with oral biofilm, then groups J30 and J60 received the respective decontamination treatments. Microbiologic analysis was performed by counting the colony-forming units (CFUs), and a qualitative descriptive analysis of the implant surface was performed after microbiologic analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Statistical analysis included one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey tests and the independent t test, with a .05 significance level. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction (P < .01) in the number of CFUs in groups J30 (3.63 × 106 ± 0.32) and J60 (2.74 × 106 ± 0.21) compared with group C (5.05 × 106 ± 0.43). Both decontaminated groups were statistically different from group S, which did not show bacterial growth (P < .01). When groups J30 and J60 were compared, there was also a significant difference between them (P < .01), and the group J60 showed greater decontaminating potential. The descriptive qualitative analysis did not show any visible changes on the surface of the implants. CONCLUSION: The sodium bicarbonate jet was effective in decontaminating titanium implants in vitro, causing no visible damage to the implant surface.",

In 4 patients, median rates of CRBSI were 2.77 (interquartile range [IQR] 0.6-5.6) on ELT versus 0 on SBLT per 1000 catheter days ( P = 0.17). The median rates of hospitalizations and ER visits for CVC-related complications were 6.1 (IQR 3.2-10.2) on ELT versus 0 on SBLT (IQR 0-0; P = 0.11) and 2.8 (IQR 2-3.6) on ELT versus 1.8 (IQR 0-3.7) on SBLT per 1000 catheter days ( P = 0.50), respectively. Rates of CVC-related complications were similar. No adverse events were reported. SBLT may be safe and effective for pediatric IF.",

      "abstract": "Background: Sodium bicarbonate Ringer's solution has been widely used in clinical practice in recent years. There are few clinical studies on the efficacy and safety of this fluid among critically ill patients until now. Method: This retrospective cohort study included critically ill adult patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Tongji Hospital from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2020. By reviewing exclusively the use of either sodium bicarbonate Ringer's solution or saline for resuscitation or maintenance, the patients were included into two groups, respectively. The primary outcome was the major adverse kidney event within 30 days (MAKE30), including death, new receipt of renal replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction. Safety outcomes were focused on arterial blood gas and plasma biochemical alterations, which might potentially be induced by the administration of bicarbonate Ringer's solution. Result: A total of 662 patients were included in the cohort. Compared to the saline group, the bicarbonate Ringer's group had a significantly lower rate of the new receipt of renal replacement therapy [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.591, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.406 to 0.861; p = 0.006]. There was no significant difference between the two groups in 30-day mortality, final creatinine level ≥200% of baseline, and major adverse kidney event within 30 days. In subgroup analysis, the incidence of MAKE30 was higher in the bicarbonate Ringer's group than that of the saline group among patients with cardiovascular disease. The patients in the bicarbonate Ringer's group had a longer length of intensive care unit stay than patients in the saline group, but their new renal replacement therapy days were shorter. No major alterations were found in arterial blood gas and plasma biochemical during the follow-up period. Conclusion: Compared to saline, sodium bicarbonate Ringer's solution exhibited a potential renal function protective effect while causing no major alterations in arterial blood gas and plasma biochemistry. However, the application in patients with cardiovascular disease diagnosis at ICU admission should be cautious."
