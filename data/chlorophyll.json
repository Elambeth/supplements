      "abstract": "Chlorophyll molecules in solution spontaneously form chlorophyll aggregates due to intermolecular interactions such as hydrophobic bonding and π-π stacking, which reduce the biological activity of the chlorophyll solution. In this study, it was explored the mechanism of pulsed electric fields (PEF) parameters on the structure and biological activity of chlorophyll aggregates. The results showed that the microstructure of chlorophyll aggregates can be changed, leading to the formation of smaller particles by adjusting parameters during PEF treatment. Moreover, the smaller chlorophylls aggregates exhibited the stronger antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities in vitro compared to control (without PEF treatment). Moreover, PEF treatment also induced changes in the microscopic state of chlorophylls confirmed by SEM. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations indicated that PEF treatment increased the radius of gyration and solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) of chlorophyll aggregates while decreasing their density compared to untreated sample. These results suggested that PEF treatment can disrupt the interaction between chlorophyll molecules, leading to the disaggregation of chlorophyll aggregates and enhancing its bioactivity.",

To explore the responses of C. panzhihuaensis to D, H, and DH, chlorophyll fluorescence and the lipid and fatty acid profiles were determined. Leaf water loss and leaf damage only occurred following DH treatment. The photochemical activity was least impacted by D stress and most severely impacted by DH stress. D treatment reduced the levels of most lipid categories and total fatty acids. Both the H and DH treatments led to a significant decrease in the levels of saccharolipids, lysophospholipids, sphingolipids, and fatty acyls, while significantly increasing the levels of neutral glycerolipids and fatty acids. Moreover, odd-numbered fatty acids and trans-fatty acids-C18:2ttn-6 accumulated significantly following both H and DH treatments. However, the levels of both total fatty acids and total lipids were significantly lower after DH stress compared to H stress. The proportion of saturated fatty acids increased after D treatment and that of polyunsaturated fatty acids increased after both H and DH treatments. Following various treatments, the degree of unsaturation in total phospholipids decreased, while that in total saccharolipids remained unchanged. Additionally, the unsaturation levels of diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol showed no change after D stress, but increased after H and DH treatments. In conclusion, C. panzhihuaensis exhibited varying levels of tolerance to D, H, and DH treatments, which may be related to the differential adjustments in lipid composition and unsaturation levels."

      "abstract": "Increasing salinity stress is a significant challenge in agriculture, affecting ~ 20% of irrigated areas worldwide. It can induce osmotic stress, oxidative stress, and nutrient imbalance in plants. Using rhizobacterial species and biochar can be an effective method to overcome this issue. Bacillus pumilus is a rhizobacteria that can enhance plant salt tolerance, facilitate nutrient solubilization in saline soils, and generate stress-alleviating metabolites. On the other hand, nitrilotriacetic acid mixed biochar (NAT-BC) can increase crop yields and mitigate salt stress by improving nutrients and water uptake. That's why the present study was carried out to explore the combined effect of NAT-BC and Bacillus pumilus on sunflowers in both non-saline and salinity-stress on sunflowers. Four treatments, i.e., 0NAT-BC, Bacillus pumilus, 0.75NAT-BC, Bacillus pumilus + 0.75NAT-BC, were applied in four replications following a completely randomized design (CRD). Results showed that Bacillus pumilus + 0.75NAT-BC caused significant enhancement in sunflower plant height (103%), stem diameter (45%), head diameter (74%), stomatal conductance (60%), and protein content (11%) rate over control under salinity stress. A significant improvement in sunflower chlorophyll a (19%), chlorophyll b (35%), and total chlorophyll (54%) compared to the control confirm the efficacy of Bacillus pumilus + 0.75NAT-BC under salinity stress. It is concluded that applying treatment Bacillus pumilus + 0.75NAT-BC can alleviate salinity stress in sunflowers via improvement in total chlorophyll contents, which was the most representative attribute in the current study. Growers are recommended to apply Bacillus pumilus + 0.75NAT-BC to achieve better sunflower growth under salinity stress.",

      "abstract": "The tomato is among the crops with the most extensive cultivated area and greatest consumption in our nation; nonetheless, secondary salinization of facility soil significantly hinders the sustainable growth of facility agriculture. Melatonin (MT), as an innovative plant growth regulator, is essential in stress responses. This research used a hydroponic setup to replicate saline stress conditions. Different endogenous levels of melatonin (MT) were established by foliar spraying of 100 μmol·L-1 MT, the MT synthesis inhibitor p-CPA (100 μmol·L-1), and a combination of p-CPA and MT, to investigate the mechanism by which MT mitigates the effects of salt stress on the photosynthetic efficiency of tomato seedlings. Results indicated that after six days of salt stress, the endogenous MT content in tomato seedlings drastically decreased, with declines in the net photosynthetic rate and photosystem performance indices (PItotal and PIabs). The OJIP fluorescence curve exhibited distortion, characterized by anomalous K-band and L-band manifestations. Exogenous MT dramatically enhanced the gene (TrpDC, T5H, SNAcT, and AcSNMT) expression of critical enzymes in MT synthesis, therefore boosting the level of endogenous MT. The application of MT enhanced the photosynthetic parameters. MT treatment decreased the fluorescence intensities of the J-phase and I-phase in the OJIP curve under salt stress, attenuated the irregularities in the K-band and L-band performance, and concurrently enhanced quantum yield and energy partitioning ratios. It specifically elevated φPo, φEo, and ψo, while decreasing φDo. The therapy enhanced parameters of both the membrane model (ABS/RC, DIo/RC, ETo/RC, and TRo/RC) and leaf model (ABS/CSm, TRo/CSm, ETo/CSm, and DIo/CSm). Conversely, the injection of exogenous p-CPA exacerbated salt stress-related damage to the photosystem of tomato seedlings and diminished the beneficial effects of MT. The findings suggest that exogenous MT mitigates salt stress-induced photoinhibition by (1) modulating endogenous MT concentrations, (2) augmenting PSII reaction center functionality, (3) safeguarding the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC), (4) reinstating PSI redox potential, (5) facilitating photosynthetic electron transport, and (6) optimizing energy absorption and dissipation. As a result, MT markedly enhanced photochemical performance and facilitated development and salt stress resilience in tomato seedlings."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tocopherols are a class of lipid-soluble compounds that have multiple functional roles in plants and exhibit vitamin E activity, an essential nutrient for human and animal health. The tocopherol biosynthetic pathway is conserved across the plant kingdom, but source of the key tocopherol pathway precursor, phytol, is unclear. Two protochlorophyllide reductases (POR1 and POR2) were previously identified as loci controlling the natural variation of total tocopherols in maize grain, a non-photosynthetic tissue. POR1 and POR2 are key genes in chlorophyll biosynthesis yet the contribution of the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway to tocopherol biosynthesis is still not understood. RESULTS: We took two approaches to alter the activity of these two POR genes within kernel tissue, physiological treatments and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockouts, to determine the role of chlorophyll biosynthesis for tocopherol content. Since light is required for POR enzymatic activity, we imposed a dark treatment on developing kernels, which reduced chlorophyll a and tocopherols levels in embryo tissue by 92-99% and 87-90%, respectively, compared to the light treatment. In CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockouts, the levels of chlorophyll a and tocopherols in embryos of the por1 por2 double homozygous mutant were reduced by 98-100% and 76-83%, respectively, compared to WT. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that tocopherol synthesis in maize grain depends almost entirely on phytol derived from chlorophyll biosynthesis within the embryo. POR1 and POR2 activity play crucial roles in chlorophyll biosynthesis, underscoring the importance of POR alleles and their activity in the biofortification of vitamin E levels in non-photosynthetic grain of maize.",

      "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been utilized to treat various malignant cancers for more than a century. However, many photosensitizers (e.g., derivatives of porphyrins, chlorins, etc.) central to PDT are still suffering from limitations such as water insolubility, dark toxicity, photo/thermal-instability, difficult synthesis/preparation, and poor tumor selectivity. Numerous effective strategies include designing new synthetic photosensitizers by exploiting heavy atom effect, aggregation-induced emission effect (AIE), and electronic/energy effects (donor-acceptor, and Förster resonance energy transfer: FRET), and the linkage of activatable and targeting molecules has been developed to address one or more of these limitations. However, these structural modifications of photosensitizing organic molecules are synthetically challenging and unpredictable in terms of efficacy versus toxicity. Herein, we report a new and simple strategy for effective PDT by combining natural spinach-derived chlorophylls (photosensitizer) with natural water-soluble chlorophyll proteins (WSCPs) derived originally from plants and produced heterologously by bacteria (E. coli). The recombinant WSCPs (chlorophyll-WSCP) are tetrameric and stable under air/thermal conditions and importantly can produce highly reactive singlet oxygen under red/far-red light irradiation to induce cancer cell death. Our in vivo mouse model studies (melanoma xenografts) further validate the efficacy of the recombinant WSCPs as a new class of water-soluble, nontoxic, and highly efficient photosensitizers for PDT. This work represents the first example of the application of WSCPs in PDT and may advance the clinical applications of PDT for cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "Culm sheaths are capable of photosynthesis and are an important class of non-leaf organs in bamboo plants. The source-sink interaction mechanism has been found to play an important role in the interaction between culm sheaths and internodes in Bambusa multiplex. Research on the regulatory mechanisms of culm sheath senescence is important for the study of internode growth, but reports in this regard are limited. In this study, a weighted gene co-expression network analysis was performed on transcriptome data of B. multiplex culm sheaths at different developmental stages and identified some gene modules significantly related to the typical senescence stages (SS3 and SS4). Among these modules, one module significantly associated with both SS3 and SS4 was identified, and its hub gene (BmCCD8) was a key gene of the strigolactones (SLs) synthesis pathway. To verify the relationship between SLs and culm sheath senescence, we performed experiments such as detection of endogenous hormone, treatment with exogenous hormones, transmission electron microscopic observation and detection of gene expression levels. A positive relationship was found between the SL content and the degree of sheath senescence. Treatment with the artificial SL analog GR24 resulted in a significant decrease in chlorophyll content in the sheath, while treatment with the SL synthesis inhibitor Tis108 led to a significant increase in chlorophyll content. A different response pattern to exogenous GR24 and Tis108 was also observed in genes related to the chlorophyll degradation pathway. Chloroplasts were also found to begin degradation one day after the end of exogenous GR24 treatment. Thus, we concluded that SLs may regulate culm sheath senescence by promoting chlorophyll degradation.",

      "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd), as one of the most toxic nonessential elements, severely prohibits plant growth and development. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) play essential roles in plant response to abiotic stress. However, the potential mechanism of H2S and MeJA in alleviating Cd stress in plants remains unclear. In the current study, the importance and crosstalk of H2S and MeJA in the Cd tolerance of cucumber seedlings have been investigated. Our results revealed that Cd stress obviously prohibited the growth of cucumber seedlings. Optimal concentrations of H2S donor sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) or MeJA treatment, respectively, or in combination, significantly enhanced seedling growth under Cd stress. However, the positive effects of H2S during seedling growth were obviously reversed by the application of MeJA biosynthesis inhibitors, which implied that MeJA might be involved in the H2S-improved growth of cucumber seedlings under Cd stress. Moreover, Cd stress resulted in the increase in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide radical (O2·-) accumulation, and impaired the functioning of the ascorbate-glutathione cycle. Both H2S and MeJA decreased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and ameliorated the negative effects of Cd stress through significantly increasing the ratio of ascorbate (AsA)/dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) and reduced glutathione (GSH)/oxidized glutathione (GSSG). Besides that, the expression level of ROS scavenge genes was significantly upregulated by the application of exogenous H2S or MeJA treatment. Moreover, H2S and MeJA significantly enhanced the chlorophyll concentration and inhibited chlorophyll degradation through decreasing the expression levels of chlorophyll catabolic enzymes. Additionally, exogenous H2S and MeJA obviously enhanced the chlorophyll fluorescence. However, MeJA biosynthesis inhibitors significantly suppressed the positive role of H2S. The above results suggested MeJA is involved in H2S-induced Cd stress alleviation in cucumber seedlings through enhancing ROS-scavenge capacity and improving the photosynthesis system.",

In the present study we evaluated the PDT efficacy of an NIR absorbing chlorophyll derivative 'Cycloimide Purpurin-18 (CIPp-18)' in Human Breast carcinoma (MCF-7) and cervical adenocarcinoma (Hela) cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. PDT with CIPp-18 (2.0 µM, 3 h) and NIR light (700 ± 25 nm, 0.36-1.4 J /cm2) induced potent phototoxicity in both the cell lines. Under hypoxic conditions, PDT induced ~ 32% and 42% phototoxicity at LD50 and LD70 light dose, respectively, which corresponds to phototoxic dose under normoxia. CIPp-18 in neat buffer (pH 7.4) showed generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) as well as superoxide (O2·-) radicals. Studies on ROS generation in cells using fluorescence probes and the effect of mechanistic probes of 1O2 (Sodium Azide, Histidine, D2O) and free radicals (DMSO, Mannitol, Cyanocobalamin, SOD-PEG) on phototoxicity show that 1O2 plays major role in phototoxicity under normoxia. Whereas, under hypoxic conditions, PDT led to no significant generation of ROS and phototoxicity remained unaffected by cyanocobalamin, a quencher of O2·-. Moreover, CIPp-18 showed localization in cell membrane and PDT led to more pronounced loss of membrane permeability in cells under hypoxia than for normoxia. These results demonstrate that CIPp-18 is suitable for PDT of cancer cells under hypoxia and also suggest that phototoxicity under hypoxia is mediated via ROS-independent contact-dependent mechanism.",

      "abstract": "Climate change significantly impacts the risk of eutrophication and, consequently, chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations. Understanding the impact of water flows is a crucial first step in developing insights into future patterns of change and associated risks. In this study, the Statistical DownScaling Model (SDSM)-a widely used daily downscaling method-is implemented to produce downscaled local climate variables, which serve as input for simulating future hydro-climate conditions using a hydrological model. The vulnerability of water quality, particularly Chl-a concentrations in the Latyan Dam and Tehranpars Water Treatment Plant (TWTP) is assessed through six fuzzy regression models under three scenarios: RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5. Projections indicate an increase in minimum temperatures for the Jajrood watershed ranging from 92 to 93%. Seasonal forecasts suggest significant precipitation during the dry season. The HYMOD model predicts increases in streamflow of approximately 97%, 90%, and 92% by 2050 under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, respectively, indicating a heightened risk of flooding that poses economic, health, and environmental concerns. Among the six fuzzy regression models, FGR1, FGR3, and FGR4 demonstrated the most favorable results in modeling Chl-a output from the TWTP. In conclusion, while Chl-a concentrations in the effluent of the TWTP are only slightly influenced by climate change, the effects on streamflow patterns are significant. These findings highlight serious future water quality challenges and increased vulnerability of water resources due to climate change.",

      "abstract": "Salinity stress disrupts water uptake and nutrient absorption, causing reduced photosynthesis, stunted growth, and decreased crop yields in plants. The use of indole acetic acid (IAA), arginine (AN), and mango fruit waste biochar (MFWB) can be effective methods to overcome this problem. Indole acetic acid (IAA) is a natural auxin hormone that aids cell elongation and division, thereby increasing plant height and branching. L-arginine, an amino acid, is crucial for plant defense mechanisms, forming proline, polyamines, and nitric oxide, which regulate biological activities and prevent oxidative damage. Mango fruit waste biochar enhances soil fertility and water retention, thereby enhancing fruit development and yield. This study investigates the effects of combining IAA and AN as amendments to fenugreek, with and without MFWB. Four treatments (control, 2mM IAA, 250 mg/L AN, and 250 mg/L AN + 2mM IAA) study were conducted in four replications using a completely randomized design. Results demonstrate that the 250 mg/L AN + 2mM IAA with MFWB treatment led to a significant rise in fenugreek plant length (30.26%), plant fresh weight (36.37%), and plant dry weight (15.78%) over the control under salinity stress. There was a notable increase in chlorophyll a (5.13%), chlorophyll b (14.06%), total chlorophyll (7.79%), and shoot N, P, K from the control under salinity stress also showing the potential of 250 mg/L AN + 2mM IAA with MFWB. In conclusion, applying 250 mg/L AN + 2mM IAA with MFWB is a strategy for alleviating salinity stress in fenugreeks.",

      "abstract": "It is very important to determine the chlorophyll content (SPAD) and nitrogen (N) requirement in order to increase the seed yield and nutritional quality of wheat. This research was carried out with three N doses (0, 50, 100 kg ha-1) and nine wheat cultivars (Alpu-2001, Soyer-02, Kate-A1, Bezostaja-1, Altay-2000, Müfitbey, Nacibey, Harmankaya-99 and Sönmez-2001) during 2-years field condition according to factorial randomized complete block design and three replications. In this study, with the increase of N dose (N50), seed yield increased by 13%, plant height by 10.8%, 1,000 seed weight by 10.5% compared to control plants (N0). The increase of N dose from 50 kg ha-1 to 100 kg gave lower increase rates in the same criteria (11.7%, 11.4%, 10.3%, respectively). However, the spike number per plant, spikelet number in spike, seed number in spike, spike length showed statistically significant differences between N doses and varieties. Boost of N doses caused a significant increase compared to plants without N application. The chlorophyll content and flag leaf area index were determined at three growth times (1st growth time; early, 2nd growth time; the middle and end of flowering, 3rd growth time; with a 10-day interval). Chlorophyll content was significantly (p < 0.01) affected by the N dose, variety and growth time. As N doses increased, chlorophyll content increased, and it was higher at both N doses compared with N0. The chlorophyll content had the highest rates (30.22%) at 1st growth time and it decreased as the growth period progressed. N doses, varieties and their interactions had significant effects on the flag leaf area index. The highest flag leaf area index (41.9 cm2) was determined from variety Bezostaja-1 and 100 kg ha-1 N dose treatment. The effect of N dose was found significantly on abaxial and adaxial stomata width-length and epidermal cells. The adaxial and abaxial stomata width were higher than N0 at both N levels. The highest adaxial and abaxial stomata width- length was obtained from 100 kg ha-1 N dose. As nitrogen concentration increased, both stomatal density and stomatal index increased. The stomatal index varied between 19% and 36%. The lowest stomata density had appeared in the 100 kg ha-1 N dose and Bezostaja-1 variety. As a result, stomatal characteristics, chlorophyll content, and agronomic traits of wheat were significantly affected by increasing N doses.",

      "abstract": "The present study aimed to investigate the impact of progressive drought stress (100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% of field capacity) on photosynthetic light reactions of tomato plants. The imposed drought caused a gradual reduction in leaf RWC leading to a decline in pigment concentration and growth indices.  Significant alteration in the OJIP fluorescence transient curves and the formation of specific fluorescence bands (L, K, J, H, and G) gradually increased as drought severity increased. Phenomenological energy fluxes per excited cross-section (ABS/CS, TRo/CS, DIo/CS, ETo/CS and RC/CS) decreased with intensifying drought. As drought stress progressed, JIP-test parameters including The efficiencies of light reactions [φPo/(1- φPo )], the efficiencies of redox reactions [(ψo/(1-ψo)] and the efficiency of PSI to reduce the last electron acceptors [δRo/(1-δRo)] were significantly attenuated. The quantum yields for primary photochemistry (φPo), electron transfer from QA to QB (yO), electron transport (φEo), and reduction of end electron acceptors at the PSI acceptor side (φRo) were negatively affected by drought stress. These results indicate that drought progression leads to structural and functional damage in PSII, characterized by a decrease in active reaction centers, reduced energy absorption and trapping, diminished energetic connectivity within PSII, and inhibition of the oxygen-evolving complex. Additionally, reduced plastoquinone pool size, over-reduction of plastoquinone, and impaired redox state downstream of QB were observed at the donor side of PSII.  The quantum yield and efficiency of PSI to reduce electron acceptors were reduced by drought progression. Our results showed that the transcript levels of PetE and PetF genes, encoding the key electron careers plastocyanin and ferredoxin, were significantly downregulated in response to an increase in drought severity, contributing to reduced PSI efficiency. The Transcript levels of PetE and PetF were reduced by 79% and 66% under 25% field capacity treatment, respectively. These results highlight critical points within the photosynthetic apparatus that are highly sensitive to drought, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms of drought-induced damage in tomato plants.",

      "abstract": "WRKY transcription factors are widely involved in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, including cold stress. However, they have not been well studied in the regulation of chlorophyll synthesis and cold tolerance. So it is meaningful to analyze the mechanism under cold stress in non-heading Chinese cabbage. Here, BcWRKY53, a transcriptional activator WRKY-III gene, was identified by a screen upstream of the key chlorophyll synthesis genes BcCHLH and BcGUN4. BcWRKY53 was localized in the cell nucleus and induced to a significant extent by cold treatment. Ectopic expression of BcWRKY53 in Arabidopsis not only increased the chlorophyll content under cold stress, but also improved the cold tolerance. After silencing of BcWRKY53, there was a decrease in chlorophyll content and an increase in cold sensitivity. BcWRKY53 could inhibit self-expression by binding W-boxes in its own promoter. In addition, histone deacetylase 9 (BcHDA9) interacted with BcWRKY53 to inhibit BcWRKY53-mediated transcriptional activation. When ectopically overexpressed, BcHDA9 negatively regulates chlorophyll content and cold tolerance under cold treatment. Taken together, this study demonstrated that the cold-inducible transcription factor BcWRKY53 positively regulates BcCHLH and BcGUN4 under the regulation of self-regulation and BcHDA9 interactions. In this way, BcWRKY53 is actively involved in chlorophyll synthesis and the establishment of cold tolerance, which providing practical theoretical support in molecular characterization of cold tolerance and variety selection of non-heading Chinese cabbage.",

      "abstract": "In this work, the atmospheric pressure air gliding arc discharge has been produced for the generation of plasma-activated water (PAW) and studying its effect on the chlorophyll retention and greenness of Tejpat (Cinnamomum tamala) leaves. The discharge is characterized via electrical and optical methods to calculate the electron excitation temperature (1.38 eV) and density ( 3.46 × 10 17   cm-3) of the plasma. The influence of plasma exposure time on the physico-chemical properties of PAW and the aging effect of electrical conductivity, pH, total dissolved solids, oxidation-reduction potential, and concentration of nitrite and nitrate are presented. It is found that the modification in physico-chemical properties of water has a considerable effect on chlorophyll retention and the greenness of detached leaves. The chlorophyll retention is highest for the leaves that are treated with 12 minutes of PAW as compared to the other plasma exposure time as well as untreated water. Moreover, the greenness of leaves for 12 minutes of plasma treatment remains for a longer duration ( 576 ± 34 hrs) as compared to treatment times of 0, 4, 8, and 16 minutes due to prolonged activeness of the physical parameters. This work is significant in that PAW plays an important role in maintaining greenness in detached green leaves."

Results showed that both Bs and Si treatments enhanced Chl and carbon metabolism, with the combined Bs and Si treatment showing a synergistic effect. Specifically, Bs + Si enhanced the mutual conversion of Chl a and Chl b, restored the equilibrium in Chl a and Chl b content, and increased RuBisco activity by 31.07%, thereby promoting carbon fixation. Subsequently, Bs + Si re-balanced the carbohydrate content, by increasing the sucrose synthase (SS), and β-amylase (BMY) activities by 49.57%, and 83.59% respectively, and decreasing sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS), and granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) activities by 38.93%, 40.93% respectively etc involved in the metabolism of sucrose and starch. Furthermore, Bs + Si facilitated the restoration of the typical progression of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and glycolysis pathway (EMP). These findings highlight the synergistic role of Bs and Si in enhancing the salt and drought resilience of G. uralensis seedlings, offering promising strategies for sustainable agriculture, improving crop resilience to climate change, and achieving the \"dual carbon\" goals of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality.",

      "abstract": "Experimental data were analyzed to investigate the underlying adsorption or degradation mechanism of carotenoids and chlorophylls over the bleaching of sunflower oil through different amplitudes of horn and bath ultrasound (ultrasound-assisted bleaching; UAB), temperature, time, and bleaching clay. Quantifying the color removal efficiency in both batch and continuous systems, along with the corresponding process time and energy consumption, is paramount for evaluating the energy-related performance of the treatment method. The adsorption of pigments onto activated bentonite was notably rapid and effective when ultrasound was employed. In both bleaching processes, the adsorption kinetics of carotenoids and chlorophyll exhibited a pseudo-second-order behavior. At the same time, a pseudo-first-order equation provided a better fit for the control conditions. Moreover, intra-particle diffusion contributed to the adsorption mechanism, although it was not the only rate-limiting step in the adsorption of pigments on the clay. It is hypothesized that carotenoid and chlorophyll adsorption occur through physisorption in control conditions, while chemical reactions play a role in pigment removal under sonication. The Freundlich isotherm yielded precise estimates of the adsorption equilibrium data for carotenoid and chlorophyll during ultrasonic bleaching, suggesting a multilayer adsorption mechanism under ultrasound exposure. The thermodynamic study found that pigment adsorption was feasible, spontaneous, and endothermic. According to the results, horn and bath ultrasound, especially at higher voltages, can remarkably remove carotenoid and chlorophyll from sunflower oil compared to the traditional bleaching process.",

However, the regulatory mechanism of temperature-dependent changes in photosynthetic pigment contents and the resultant leaf colors remain unclear. Here, we examined the chloroplast microstructure, shoot phenotype, photosynthetic pigment content, and the expression of pigment synthesis-related genes in three tea genotypes with different leaf colors under different temperature conditions. The electron microscopy results revealed that all varieties experienced the most severe chloroplast damage at 15 °C, particularly in albino cultivar Baiye 1 (BY), where chloroplast basal lamellae were loosely arranged, and some chloroplasts were even empty. In contrast, the chloroplast basal lamellae at 35 °C and 25 °C were neatly arranged and well-developed, outperforming those observed at 20 °C and 15 °C. Chlorophyll and carotenoid measurements revealed a significant reduction in chlorophyll content under low temperature treatment, peaking at ambient temperature followed by high temperatures. Interestingly, BY showed remarkable tolerance to high temperatures, maintaining relatively high chlorophyll content, indicating its sensitivity primarily to low temperatures. Furthermore, the trends in gene expression related to chlorophyll and carotenoid metabolism were largely consistent with the pigment content. Correlation analysis identified key genes responsible for temperature-induced changes in these pigments, suggesting that changes in their expression likely contribute to temperature-dependent leaf color variations.",

To understand the effect of CLA on the structure and dynamics of thylakoid membranes, coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG MD) simulations of thylakoid membranes are performed by varying the numbers of CLA at 293 K using MARTINI-2 force fields. The membrane undergoes a lamellar to nonlamellar phase transition above a critical concentration of CLA. The CLAs dynamically form aggregates of different orders and preferentially fetch the least unsaturated nonbilayer-forming lipids around them, resulting in a nonlamellar phase with fused regions. These fused regions cause a structural arrest of CLA and lipids, inducing dynamic heterogeneity manifested by non-Gaussian parameters and van Hove correlation functions. The lamellar to nonlamellar phase transition of the membrane is associated with a drastic reduction in correlation length of the immobile CLA and lipids governed by the fused topology. Such insights into CLA-induced structural transitions in thylakoid membranes are pertinent for understanding nonphotochemical quenching mechanisms and hold promise for designing future artificial photosynthetic materials and applications in photodynamic therapy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: During the cold season, low temperature (LT) and high relative humidity (HRH) are significant environmental factors in greenhouses and plastic tunnels, often hindering plant growth and development. The chlorophyll (Chl) biosynthesis inhibitory mechanisms under LT and HRH stress are still widely unclear. To understand how cucumbers seedlings respond to LT and HRH stress, we investigated the impact of these stressors on Chl biosynthesis. RESULTS: Our results revealed that individual LT, HRH and combined LT + HRH stress conditions affected chlorophyll a, b, total chlorophyll and carotenoid content, reducing the levels of these pigments. The levels of Chlorophyll precursors were also markedly reduced under LT and HRH stresses, with the greatest reduction observed in cucumber seedlings exposed to LT + HRH conditions (9/5℃, 95%HRH). The activities of glutamate-1-semialdehyde transaminase (GSA-AT), ALA dehydratase (ALAD), Mg-chelatase, and protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR) were increased under individual LT, HRH, conditions but decreased by combination of LT + HRH stress condition. In addition, Chl biosynthesis related genes (except PBG) were upregulated by the HRH stress but were significantly downregulated under the LT + HRH stress condition in cucumber seedlings. Furthermore, the content of phenols, flavonoids and phenolic acids (cinnamic acid and caffeic acid) were significantly surged under LT + HRH treatment over the control. Histochemical observation showed higher O2- and H2O2 content in cucumber leaves during the LT and HRH stress. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that LT + HRH stress significantly impairs chlorophyll biosynthesis in cucumber seedlings by drastically reducing pigment accumulation, altering enzyme activity and gene expression. Additionally, LT + HRH stress induces oxidative damage, which further exacerbates the decline in chlorophyll content and affects overall cucumber metabolism.",

Fluorescence Detected Magnetic Resonance (FDMR) allowed resolving four Chl d triplet (3Chl d) populations (T1-T4) both in untreated and illuminated samples in the presence of ascorbate and N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD). The FDMR signals increased following the pre-illumination treatment, particularly for the T3 and T4 populations, which are therefore sensitive to the redox state of PSI cofactors. Microwave-induced Triplet minus Singlet (TmS) spectra were detected in the |D|-|E| resonance window of the T3 and T4 triplets. These showed a broad singlet bleaching centred at 740 nm and also displayed complex spectral structure with several derivative-like features, indicating that both the T3 and T43Chl d populations are associated with the PSI reaction centre (RC) triplet, P3740. Parallel measurements by TR-EPR demonstrated that triplet signals observed under all conditions investigated are dominated by an electron spin polarisation (esp), which is typical of intersystem crossing, differently from what expected for recombination triplet states formed from a radical pair precursor. Moreover, stronger reductant conditions obtained by pre-illumination of the samples in the presence of dithionite and 5-methylphenazinium methyl sulfate (PMS) did not lead to a recombination triplet state esp, but rather to a decrease of the whole signal intensity. The energetics of A. marina PSI and the possible occurrence of distributions of cofactors redox properties are discussed in order to address the unexpected P3740 esp.",

      "abstract": "To investigate the relationship between the lighting direction-induced morphophysiological traits and post-harvest storage of lettuce, the effects of different lighting directions (top, T; top + side, TS; top + bottom, TB; side + bottom, SB; and top + side + bottom, TSB; the light from different directions for a sum of light intensity of 600 μmol·m-2·s-1 photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD)) on the growth morphology, root development, leaf thickness, stomatal density, chlorophyll concentration, photosynthesis, and chlorophyll fluorescence, as well as the content of nutrition such as carbohydrates and soluble proteins in lettuce were analyzed. Subsequently, the changes in water loss rate, membrane permeability (measured as relative conductivity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content), brittleness (assessed by both brittleness index and β-galactosidase (β-GAL) activity), and yellowing degree (evaluated based on chlorophyll content, and activities of chlorophyllase (CLH) and pheophytinase (PPH)) were investigated during the storage after harvest. The findings indicate that the TS treatment can effectively reduce shoot height, increase crown width, enhance leaves' length, width, number, and thickness, and improve chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics, photosynthetic capacity, and nutrient content in lettuce before harvest. Specifically, lettuce's leaf thickness and stomatal density showed a significant increase. Reasonable regulation of water loss in post-harvested lettuce is essential for delaying chlorophyll degradation. It was utilized to mitigate the increase in conductivity and hinder the accumulation of MDA in lettuce. The softening speed of leafy vegetables was delayed by effectively regulating the activity of the β-GAL. Chlorophyll degradation was alleviated by affecting CLH and PPH activities. This provides a theoretical basis for investigating the relationship between creating a favorable light environment and enhancing the post-harvest preservation of leafy vegetables, thus prolonging their post-harvest storage period through optimization of their morphophysiological phenotypes."

In this study, we investigated the impact of differing red and far-red light ratios on plant growth using LED lamps with different wavelengths and Ca1.8Mg1.2Al2Ge3O12:0.03Cr3+ phosphor materials. The control group (CK) consisted of a plant growth special lamp with 450 nm blue light + 650 nm red light. Four treatments were established: F1 (650 nm red light), F2 (CK + 730 nm far-red light in a 3:2 ratio), F3 (650 nm red light + 730 nm far-red light in a 3:2 ratio), and F4 (CK + phosphor-converted far-red LED in a 3:2 ratio). The study assessed changes in red and far-red light ratios and their impact on the growth morphology, photosynthetic characteristics, fluorescence characteristics, stomatal status, and nutritional quality of cream lettuce. The results revealed that the F3 light treatment exhibited superior growth characteristics and quality compared to the CK treatment. Notably, leaf area, aboveground fresh weight, vitamin C content, and total soluble sugar significantly increased. Additionally, the addition of far-red light resulted in an increase in stomatal density and size, and the F3 treatments were accompanied by increases in net photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), and stomatal conductance (Gs). The results demonstrated that the F3 treatment, with its optimal red-to-far-red light ratio, promoted plant growth and photosynthetic characteristics. This indicates its suitability for supplementing artificial light sources in plant factories and greenhouses."

The concentrations and the relative expression of AMV and WCMV coat proteins were determined by a double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) in a double infection of N. benthamiana with AMV and WCMV. Meanwhile, virion morphology, ultrastructure morphology, and chlorophyll content were observed and determined by electron microscopy. The results showed that the diseased symptoms were more serious, and virus concentration and relative expression of AMV and WCMV coat proteins were also higher in N. benthamiana double infection with AMV and WCMV than in AMV or WCMV single infection. The main symptoms manifested as severe mottle mosaic, shrinkage, and chlorosis. The concentrations of AMV and WCMV were 182.23 pg/mL and 148.77 pg/mL of double infection with AMV and WCMV, which were 1.75-fold and 1.62-fold than AMV and WCMV single infection, respectively. The relative expression of AMV and WCMV coat proteins was 4.25-fold and 2.50-fold than the single virus infection, respectively. Electron microscopy also observed that chloroplast malformation, cell membrane deformation, contents dissolution, grana lamella disorder, fat granules increased and enlarged, starch granules enlarged, and mitochondria were seriously malformed in a double infection of N. benthamiana with AMV and WCMV. The chlorophyll content was significantly lower for double infection with AMV and WCMV than for AMV or WCMV single-infected and CK, reduced by 31.52 %, 22.83 %, and 76.09 %, respectively. This is the first report of a double infection of N. benthamiana with AMV and WCMV that increases both virus concentrations and synergistically changes both host organelle ultrastructure and chlorophyll content.",

      "abstract": "Tea plants are a perennial crop with significant economic value. Chlorophyll, a key factor in tea leaf color and photosynthetic efficiency, is affected by the photoperiod and usually exhibits diurnal and seasonal variations. In this study, high-throughput transcriptomic analysis was used to study the chlorophyll metabolism, under different photoperiods, of tea plants. We conducted a time-series sampling under a skeleton photoperiod (6L6D) and continuous light conditions (24 L), measuring the chlorophyll and carotenoid content at a photoperiod interval of 3 h (24 h). Transcriptome sequencing was performed at six time points across two light cycles, followed by bioinformatics analysis to identify and annotate the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in chlorophyll metabolism. The results revealed distinct expression patterns of key genes in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway. The expression levels of CHLE (magnesium-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester cyclase gene), CHLP (geranylgeranyl reductase gene), CLH (chlorophyllase gene), and POR (cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase gene), encoding enzymes in chlorophyll synthesis, were increased under continuous light conditions (24 L). At 6L6D, the expression levels of CHLP1.1, POR1.1, and POR1.2 showed an oscillating trend. The expression levels of CHLP1.2 and CLH1.1 showed the same trend, they both decreased under light treatment and increased under dark treatment. Our findings provide potential insights into the molecular basis of how photoperiods regulate chlorophyll metabolism in tea plants.",

This study selected a pair of sweet corn sister lines, nicosulfuron (NIF)-resistant HK301 and NIF-sensitive HK320, and sprayed them both with 80 mg kg-1 of GO-NIF, with clean water as a control, to study the effect of GO-NIF on sweet corn seedling growth, photosynthesis, chlorophyll fluorescence, and antioxidant system enzyme activity. Compared to spraying water and GO alone, spraying GO-NIF was able to effectively reduce the toxic effect of NIF on sweet corn seedlings. Compared with NIF treatment, 10 days after of spraying GO-NIF, the net photosynthetic rate (A), stomatal conductance (Gs), transpiration rate (E), photosystem II photochemical maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm), photochemical quenching coefficient (qP), and photosynthetic electron transfer rate (ETR) of GO-NIF treatment were significantly increased by 328.31%, 132.44%, 574.39%, 73.53%, 152.41%, and 140.72%, respectively, compared to HK320. Compared to the imbalance of redox reactions continuously induced by NIF in HK320, GO-NIF effectively alleviated the observed oxidative pressure. Furthermore, compared to NIF treatment alone, GO-NIF treatment effectively increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), guaiacol peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) in both lines, indicating GO induced resistance to the damage caused by NIF to sweet corn seedlings. This study will provides an empirical basis for understanding the detoxification promoting effect of GO in NIF and analyzing the mechanism of GO induced allogeneic detoxification in cells.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nitrogen (N) is a crucial element for increasing photosynthesis and crop yields. The study aims to evaluate the photosynthetic regulation and yield formation mechanisms of different nodulating peanut varieties with N fertilizer application. METHOD: The present work explored the effect of N fertilizer application rates (N0, N45, N105, and N165) on the photosynthetic characteristics, chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics, dry matter, N accumulation, and yield of four peanut varieties. RESULTS: The results showed that N application increased the photosynthetic capacity, dry matter, N accumulation, and yield of peanuts. The measurement of chlorophyll a fluorescence revealed that the K-phase, J-phase, and I-phase from the OJIP curve decreased under N105 treatment compared with N0, and WOI, ET0/CSM, RE0/CSM, ET0/RC, RE0/RC, φPo, φEo, φRo, and Ψ0 increased, whereas VJ, VI, WK, ABS/RC, TR0/RC, DI0/RC, and φDo decreased. Meanwhile, the photosystem activity and electron transfer efficiency of nodulating peanut varieties decreased with an increase in N (N165). However, the photosynthetic capacity and yield of the non-nodulating peanut variety, which highly depended on N fertilizer, increased with an increase in N. CONCLUSION: Optimized N application (N105) increased the activity of the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center, improved the electron and energy transfer performance in the photosynthetic electron transport chain, and reduced the energy dissipation of leaves in nodulating peanut varieties, which is conducive to improving the yield. Nevertheless, high N (N165) had a positive effect on the photosystem and yield of non-nodulating peanut. The results provide highly valuable guidance for optimizing peanut N management and cultivation measures.",

The objectives of this study were to explore the drought tolerance of blue honeysuckle, determine the effect of drought stress on two photosystems, and examine the mechanism of acquired drought tolerance. In this study, blue honeysuckle under four levels of simulated field capacity (100%, 85%, 75%, and 65% RH) was grown in split-root pots for drought stress treatment, for measuring the changes in chlorophyll content, photosynthetic characteristics, and leaf chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. The chlorophyll content of each increased under mild stress and decreased under moderate and severe stress. The net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, intercellular carbon dioxide concentration, and stomatal conductance of blue honeysuckle decreased with the increase in water stress. However, the water utilization rate and stomatal limit system increased under mild and moderate stress and decreased under severe stress. The maximum fluorescence (Fm), maximum photochemical efficiency, and quantum efficiency of photosystem II decreased with the decrease in soil water content, and the initial fluorescence increased significantly (p < 0.01). With the decrease in soil water content, the energy allocation ratio parameters decreased under severe drought stress. The main activity of the unit reaction center parameters first increased and then decreased. ABS/CSm, TRo/CSm, ETo/CSm, and REo/CSm gradually declined. After a comprehensive analysis, the highest scores were obtained under adequate irrigation (CK). Overall, we concluded that the water irrigation system of blue honeysuckle should be considered adequate."

      "abstract": "Aluminum (Al) toxicity is an important factor restricting the normal growth of plants in acidic soil. Rhododendron (Ericaceae) can grow relatively well in acidic soil. To uncover the adaptive mechanisms of photosynthesis under Al stress, the influence of Al stress on the photosynthetic activities of Al-sensitive (Baijinpao) and Al-resistant (Kangnaixin) rhododendron cultivars was examined by measuring gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and the modulated reflection of light at 820 nm. Under Al stress conditions, the net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance of the rhododendron leaves decreased, whereas the intercellular CO2 concentration increased. The Al stress treatment damaged the oxygen-evolving complex of the rhododendron seedlings, while also inhibiting electron transport on the photosystem II (PSII) donor side. In addition, the exposure to Al stress restricted the oxidation of plastocyanin (PC) and the photosystem I (PSI) reaction center (P700) and led to the re-reduction of PC+ and P700+. The comparison with Kangnaixin revealed an increase in the PSII connectivity in Baijinpao. Additionally, the donor-side electron transport efficiency was more inhibited and the overall activity of PSII, PSI, and the intersystem electron transport chain decreased more extensively in Baijinpao than in Kangnaixin. On the basis of the study findings, we concluded that Al stress adversely affects photosynthesis in rhododendron seedlings by significantly decreasing the activity of PSII and PSI. Under Al stress, Kangnaixin showed stronger tolerance compared with Baijinpao.",

      "abstract": "Saline-sodic stress can limit the absorption of available zinc in rice, subsequently impacting the normal photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism of rice plants. To investigate the impact of exogenous zinc application on photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism in rice grown in saline-sodic soil, this study simulated saline-sodic stress conditions using two rice varieties, 'Changbai 9' and 'Tonghe 899', as experimental materials. Rice seedlings at 4 weeks of age underwent various treatments including control (CT), 2 μmol·L-1 zinc treatment alone (Z), 50 mmol·L-1 saline-sodic treatment (S), and 50 mmol·L-1 saline-sodic treatment with 2 μmol·L-1 zinc (Z + S). We utilized JIP-test to analyze the variations in excitation fluorescence and MR820 signal in rice leaves resulting from zinc supplementation under saline-sodic stress, and examined the impact of zinc supplementation on carbohydrate metabolism in both rice leaves and roots under saline-sodic stress. Research shows that zinc increased the chloroplast pigment content, specific energy flow, quantum yield, and performance of active PSII reaction centers (PIABS), as well as the oxidation (VOX) and reduction rate (Vred) of PSI in rice leaves under saline-sodic stress. Additionally, it decreased the relative variable fluorescence (WK and VJ) and quantum energy dissipation yield (φDO) of the rice. Meanwhile, zinc application can reduce the content of soluble sugars and starch in rice leaves and increasing the starch content in the roots. Therefore, the addition of zinc promotes electron and energy transfer in the rice photosystem under saline-sodic stress. It enhances rice carbohydrate metabolism, improving the rice plants' ability to withstand saline-sodic stress and ultimately promoting rice growth and development.",

In this investigation, the focus was placed on the chlorophyll content per unit of leaf area (LCCA) and the chlorophyll content per unit of fresh weight (LCCW) during the tuber formation phase of potatoes in Northern Shaanxi. Ground-based hyperspectral data were acquired for this purpose to formulate the vegetation index. The correlation coefficient method was used to obtain the \"trilateral\" parameters with the best correlation between potato LCCA and LCCW, empirical vegetation index, any two-band vegetation index constructed after 0-2 fractional differential transformation (step size 0.5), and the parameters with the highest correlation among the three spectral parameters, which were divided into four combinations as model inputs. The prediction models of potato LCCA and LCCW were constructed using the support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and back propagation neural network (BPNN) algorithms. The results showed that, compared with the \"trilateral\" parameter and the empirical vegetation index, the spectral index constructed by the hyperspectral reflectance after differential transformation had a stronger correlation with potato LCCA and LCCW. Compared with no treatment, the correlation between spectral index and potato LCC and the prediction accuracy of the model showed a trend of decreasing after initial growth with the increase in differential order. The highest correlation index after 0-2 order differential treatment is DI, and the maximum correlation coefficients are 0.787, 0.798, 0.792, 0.788 and 0.756, respectively. The maximum value of the spectral index correlation coefficient after each order differential treatment corresponds to the red edge or near-infrared band. A comprehensive comparison shows that in the LCCA and LCCW estimation models, the RF model has the highest accuracy when combination 3 is used as the input variable. Therefore, it is more recommended to use the LCCA to estimate the chlorophyll content of crop leaves in the agricultural practices of the potato industry. The results of this study can enhance the scientific understanding and accurate simulation of potato canopy spectral information, provide a theoretical basis for the remote sensing inversion of crop growth, and promote the development of modern precision agriculture."

Through bulked segregant analyses using whole genome sequencing of pooled F2 seedlings, we mapped 2 mutations and identified a limited number of candidate genes.

The Xantha-j (xan-j) gene was identified as encoding chlorophyll synthase, which catalyzes the last step in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway: the addition of a phytol moiety to the propionate side chain of chlorophyllide. Key amino acid residues in the active site, including the binding sites of the isoprenoid and chlorophyllide substrates, were analyzed in an AlphaFold2-generated structural model of the barley chlorophyll synthase. Three allelic mutants, xan-j.19, xan-j.59, and xan-j.64, were characterized. While xan-j.19 is a 1 base pair deletion and xan-j.59 is a nonsense mutation, xan-j.64 causes an S212F substitution in chlorophyll synthase. Our analyses of xan-j.64 and treatment of growing barley with clomazone, an inhibitor of chloroplastic isoprenoid biosynthesis, suggest that binding of the isoprenoid substrate is a prerequisite for the stable maintenance of chlorophyll synthase in the plastid. We further suggest that chlorophyll synthase is a sensor for coordinating chlorophyll and isoprenoid biosynthesis.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Pheophorbide A, a chlorophyll-breakdown product, is primarily investigated for its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. Recent reports on pheophorbide A have shown its potential in lowering blood glucose levels, thus leading to the exploration of its use in diabetes management. Literature has also shown its effect on enhanced insulin secretion, whereas its mechanism on glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in pancreatic β cells remains unexplored. METHODS: In-silico and in-vitro investigations were used to explore the effect of pheophorbide A on class I glucose transporters (GLUTs). In-silico studies include - Molecular docking studies and stability assessment using GROMACS. In-vitro studies include - MTT assay, Glucose uptake assay, Live-cell imaging and tracking of GLUTs in presence of Pheophorbide A compared to control. RESULTS: Molecular docking studies revealed better binding affinity of pheophorbide A with GLUT4 (-11.2 Kcal/mol) and GLUT1 (-10.7 Kcal/mol) when compared with metformin (-5.0 Kcal/mol and -4.9 Kcal/mol, respectively). Glucose levels are largely regulated by GLUTs where GLUT1 is one of the transporters that is ubiquitously present in human β cells. Thus, we confirmed the stability of the complex, that is, pheophorbide A-GLUT1 using GROMACS for 100 ns. We further assessed its effect on a pancreatic β cell line (INS-1) for its viability using an MTT assay. Pheophorbide A (0.1-1 µM) showed a dose-dependent response on cell viability and was comparable to standard metformin. To assess how pheophorbide A mechanistically acts on GLUT1 in pancreatic β cell, we transfected INS-1 cells with GLUT1-enhanced green fluorescent protein and checked how the treatment of pheophorbide A (0.50 µM) modulates GLUT1 trafficking using live-cell imaging. We observed a significant increase in GLUT1 density when treated with pheophorbide A (0.442 ± 0.01 µm-2) at 20 mM glucose concentration when compared to GLUT1 control (0.234 ± 0.01 µm-2) and metformin (0.296 ± 0.02 µm-2). The average speed and distance travelled by GLUT1 puncta were observed to decrease when treated with pheophorbide A. The present study also demonstrated the potential of pheophorbide A to enhance glucose uptake in β cells. CONCLUSION: The current study's findings were validated by in-silico and cellular analyses, suggesting that pheophorbide A may regulate GLUT1 and might be regarded as a potential lead for boosting the GSIS pathway, thus maintaining glucose homeostasis.",

The treatments consisted of herbicides applied in five doses as follows: in pre-planting: sulfentrazone, diclosulam, imazapic, and imazapyr, in post-planting: ethoxysulfuron, halosulfuron, 2,4-D and MSMA, and a control treatment without herbicide.

The post-emergent herbicides were considered selective. Pre-planting herbicides reduced the variables assessed at 90 DAA, observed by linear regression for diclosulam and imazapic, and exponential regression for imazapyr. Treatments with sulfentrazone caused few injury symptoms, with subsequent recovery. In addition, all the variables analyzed were equal to control, with the sulfentrazone considered selective for the IACSP95-5000 cultivar.",

In order to explore its promoting mechanism from the aspect of photosynthesis, the leaf characteristics, CO2 assimilation and chlorophyll (Chl) a fluorescence kinetics were investigated with hydroponically LC-Sr-treated Chinese cabbage seedlings. After a 28-d treatment to SrCl2 at different concentrations (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 mmol L-1), we observed an increase in the specific leaf weight (SLW) of Chinese cabbage compared with the control group. Notably, as the strontium concentration increased, a more pronounced improvement trend in the contents of Chl and protein in the leaves was observed, contributing to the enhancement of photosynthesis. However, the statistical differences in Pn among various LC-Sr treatments were not significant. Nevertheless, the leaf starch content exhibited a significant increase after LC-Sr treatments. Additionally, Chl a fluorescence transient has been used as a sensitive indicator of the promotional effect of LC-Sr on photosynthesis. The results of fluorescence parameters showed that LC-Sr treatments accelerated the light reaction speed of leaves (Tfm, dV/dto, dVG/dto), improved the energy utilization efficiency of photosystem (PSI and PSII) (ETo/CSo, ψET,ψRE, δRo, φRo), and ultimately enhanced the photosynthetic performance of leaves (PIabs, SFIabs, DFabs). The increased RCs/CSo and Sm contributed to the enhancement of the light reaction activity of strontium-treated leaves. The LC-Sr treatments had no interference with the calcium absorption, and notably enhanced the photosynthetic capacity of Chinese cabbage, shedding light on potential benefits of LC-Sr for crop cultivation.",

Understanding PSII activity and electron transport response is vital for comprehending moss abiotic stress reactions. However, little is known about the photosynthetic performance of moss under nuclide treatment. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the chlorophyll fluorescence of Racomitrium japonicum L. The moss was subjected to Sr2+ solutions at concentrations of 5, 50, and 500 mg/L to evaluate chlorophyll a fluorescence using the OJIP test. Moderate and high Sr2+ stress led to inner cell membrane dissolution and reduced chlorophyll content, indicating impaired light energy absorption. At 5 mg/L Sr2+, fluorescence kinetics showed increased light energy capture, energy dissipation, and total photosynthetic driving force, thus stimulating transient photosynthetic activity of PSII and improving PSI reduction. Linear electron transfer and PSII stability significantly decreased under moderate and high Sr2+ stress, indicating potential photosynthetic center damage. Cyclic electron transfer (CEF) alleviated photosynthetic stress at 5 mg/L Sr2+. Thus, low Sr2+ levels stimulated CEF, adjusting energy flux and partitioning to protect the photosynthetic apparatus. Nevertheless, significant damage occurred due to inefficient protection under high Sr2+ stress."

MdSnRK1.1 interacts with MdGLK1, a GOLDEN2-like transcription factor that orchestrates development of the chloroplast. Furthermore, MdSnRK1.1 affects MdGLK1 protein stability through phosphorylation. We found that Ser468 of MdGLK1 is target site of MdSnRK1.1 phosphorylation. MdSnRK1.1-mediated phosphorylation was critical for MdGLK1 binding to the target gene MdHEMA1 promoters. Collectively, our results demonstrate that ABA activates MdSnRK1.1 to degrade MdGLK1 and inhibit the accumulation of chlorophyll. These findings extend our understanding on how MdSnRK1.1 balances normal growth and hormone response."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Drought is thought to be a major abiotic stress that dramatically limits tomato growth and production. As signal molecule, melatonin (MT) and carbon monoxide (CO) can enhance plant stress resistance. However, the effect and underlying mechanism of CO involving MT-mediated drought resistance in seedling growth remains unknown. In this study, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L. 'Micro-Tom') seedlings were used to investigate the interaction and mechanism of MT and CO in response to drought stress. RESULTS: The growth of tomato seedlings was inhibited significantly under drought stress. Exogenous MT or CO mitigated the drought-induced impairment in a dose-dependent manner, with the greatest efficiency provided by 100 and 500 µM, respectively. But application of hemoglobin (Hb, a CO scavenger) restrained the positive effects of MT on the growth of tomato seedlings under drought stress. MT and CO treatment promoted chlorophyll a (Chl a) and chlorophyll a (Chl b) accumulations. Under drought stress, the intermediate products of chlorophyll biosynthesis such as protoporphyrin IX (Proto IX), Mg-protoporphyrin IX (Mg-Proto IX), potochlorophyllide (Pchlide) and heme were increased by MT or CO, but uroporphyrinogen III (Uro III) content decreased in MT-treated or CO-treated tomato seedlings. Meanwhile, MT or CO up-regulated the expression of chlorophyll and heme synthetic-related genes SlUROD, SlPPOX, SlMGMT, SlFECH, SlPOR, SlChlS, and SlCAO. However, the effects of MT on chlorophyll biosynthesis were almost reversed by Hb. CONCLUSION: The results suggested that MT and CO can alleviate drought stress and facilitate the synthesis of Chl and heme in tomato seedlings. CO played an essential role in MT-enhanced drought resistance via facilitating chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway.",

Zoysia matrella is a widely used C4 warm-season turfgrass for landscaping, golf courses, and sports fields. Here, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to target the Non-Yellow Coloring1 (ZmNYC1) gene in the highly heterozygous allotetraploid Z. matrella 'Wakaba', aiming to generate a novel stay-green variety. Of 441 Agrobacterium-infected calli, 22 (5.0%) were transformed, and 14 of these (63.6%) showed targeted mutations through cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences analysis. Sequencing analysis revealed mutations mostly consisting of 1 or 2 bp indels, occurring 2 to 4 bp upstream of the PAM sequence. Regenerated plants exhibited five ZmNYC1 target locus genotypes, including homozygous mutants with a complete knockout of all four alleles in the T0 generation. Under dark treatment, ZmNYC1-mutated plants displayed suppressed chlorophyll b (Chl b) degradation, leading to higher chlorophyll content and Chl b, with a lower chlorophyll a/chlorophyll b ratio compared to the wild type (WT). However, the ZmNYC1 mutation also inhibited plant growth in homozygous mutant genotypes, exhibiting reduced tillering compared to WT. Additionally, during winter simulation, mutant with a complete knockout retained greenness longer than the WT. This is the first successful use of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in zoysiagrass. The mutants of the ZmNYC1 gene would serve as valuable breeding material for developing improved zoysiagrass varieties that can maintain their green color for longer periods, even during winter dormancy.",

Nevertheless, the regulatory mechanisms linking chlorophyll and carbohydrate metabolism remain partially understood. Here, we uncovered the role of SlGRAS9 and SlZHD17 transcription factors in controlling chlorophyll and carbohydrate accumulation in tomato fruit. Knockout or knockdown of SlGRAS9 or SlZHD17 resulted in marked increase in chlorophyll content, reprogrammed chloroplast biogenesis and enhanced accumulation of starch and soluble sugars. Combined genome-wide transcriptomic profiling and promoter-binding experiments unveiled a complex mechanism in which the SlGRAS9/SlZHD17 regulatory module modulates the expression of chloroplast and sugar metabolism either via a sequential transcriptional cascade or through binding of both TFs to the same gene promoters, or, alternatively, via parallel pathways where each of the TFs act on different target genes. For instance, the regulation of SlAGPaseS1 and SlSUS1 is mediated by SlZHD17 whereas that of SlVI and SlGLK1 occurs only through SlGRAS9 without the intervention of SlZHD17. Both SlGRAS9 and SlZHD17 can also directly bind the promoter of SlPOR-B to regulate its expression. Taken together, our findings uncover two important regulators acting synergistically to manipulate chlorophyll and carbohydrate accumulation and provide new potential breeding targets for improving fruit quality in fleshy fruits.",

Our formulation, based on poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles, increased XL solubility and selective tumor-targeted accumulation. In our research, we revealed, for the first time, that XL binding to polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) enhances XL photophysical activity, providing the rationale for PVA application as a stabilizer for nanoformulations. Results of FTIR, DSC, and XRD revealed the physical interactions between XL and excipients, including PVA, indicating that the encapsulation maintained XL binding to PVA. The encapsulated XL exhibited higher photophysical activity compared to non-encapsulated substance, which can be attributed to the influence of residual PVA. Gamma-irradiation led to degradation of XL; however, successful sterilization of the samples was achieved through the filtration. Importantly, the encapsulated and sterilized XL retained cytotoxicity against both 2D and 3D tumor cell models, demonstrating the potential of the formulated NP-XL for photodynamic therapy applications, but lacked the ability to reactivate epigenetically silenced genes. These findings provide valuable insights into the design and characterization of PLGA-based nanoparticles for the encapsulation of photosensitizers."

MSNs and Chl-MSNs' sizes were 90.338 ± 38.49 nm and 123.84 ± 15.67 nm, respectively, as obtained by TEM; the hydrodynamic diameter for MSNs (93.69 ± 20.53 nm) and Chl-MSNs (212.95 ± 19.76 nm); and their zeta potential values are - 16.7 ± 2.19 mV and - 18.84 ± 1.40 mV. The encapsulation efficiency of Chl-MSNs was 70%. Chl-MSNs displayed no toxicity in dark conditions but showed excellent photostability under blue and red light exposure. Furthermore, using Chl over Chl-MSNs has a higher PDT efficiency than the tested cell lines. Chl-MSNs have the potential to be an effective delivery system. PDT proved to be an essential technique for cancer treatment. Blue laser is recommended over red laser with Chl and MSNs for destroying cancer cells.",

      "abstract": "Melanoma, a severe form of skin cancer intricately linked to genetic and environmental factors, is predicted to reach 100,000 new cases worldwide by 2040, underscoring the need for effective and safe treatment options. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of a photosensitizer called Chlorophyll A (Chl-A) incorporated into hydrogels (HGs) made of chitosan (CS) and poloxamer 407 (P407) for Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) against the murine melanoma cell line B16-F10. The HG was evaluated through various tests, including rheological studies, SEM, and ATR-FTIR, along with cell viability assays. The CS- and P407-based HGs effectively released Chl-A and possessed the necessary properties for topical application. The photodynamic activity of the HG containing Chl-A was evaluated in vitro, demonstrating high therapeutic potential, with an IC50 of 25.99 µM-an appealing result when compared to studies in the literature reporting an IC50 of 173.8 µM for cisplatin, used as a positive control drug. The developed formulation of CS and P407-based HG, serving as a thermosensitive system for topical applications, successfully controlled the release of Chl-A. In vitro cell studies associated with PDT exhibited potential against the melanoma cell line."

      "abstract": "Chemcial fertilizer as the main strategy for improving the vegetable yields was excessively applied in recent years which led to progressively serious soil problems such as the soil acidification. According the situation, five different biofertilizer treatments [no fertilizer (CK), inoculations of Bacillus subtilis (Bs, T1), combination of Bs and Bacillus mucilaginosus (Bs+Bm, T2), Bs and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (Bs+Ba, T3), and Bm+Ba (T4)] were conducted to investigate the effect of the growth, leaf physiological indices, and chlorophyll fluorescence of spinach seedlings in the growth chamber. The growth and physiological indices of the spinach seedlings attained a maximum under the T2 treatments. Under the T2 treatment, the ABS/RC (Absorption flux per RC), TR0/RC (Trapping flux per RC), and ET0/RC (Electron transport flux per RC) was significantly increased, while the DI0/RC [Dissipated energy flux per RC (at t = 0)] was decreased. The OJIP curve was improved under of the inoculations of fertilizers, and the increasing range was the largest under the T2 treatment. The leaf light response curve (LC) was also significantly increased under the T2 treatment. The plant growth characteristics [leaf length (LL), leaf weight (LW), plant height (PH)] were positively correlated with the J-I-P test chlorophyll fluorescence parameters [PIABS (Performance index for energy conservation from exciton to the reduction of intersystem electron acceptors), φP0 (Maximum quantum yield of primary photochemistry), φE0 (Quantum yield of electron transport), ψ0 (The probability that a trapped exciton moved an electron in electron transport chain further than QA-), TR0/RC, and ET0/RC] while negatively correlated with φD0 (Quantum yield of energy dissipation) and DI0/RC. The leaf physiological characteristics [SP (soluble protein concentrations), SC (soluble carbohydrate concentrations), Chl a (chlorophyll a), Chl b (chlorophyll b), Chl a+b, Chl a/b, and WP (water potential)] were positively correlated with the J-I-P test chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (PIABS, φP0, φE0, ψ0, ABS/RC, TR0/RC, and ET0/RC) while negatively correlated with φD0 and DI0/RC. These results indicated that the combination of Bs+Bm inoculations promoted the growth of the spinach and improved the adaptability of the vegetable to acid soil while Ba inoculation didn't have any effects to plants.",

In the murine model, oral administration of 4aa reduced the clinical severity of symptoms and scratching behavior by 76% and 72%, respectively. Notably, the elevated serum levels of Th2 cytokines reduced to levels similar to those in the normal group after oral administration of 4aa. Additionally, the toxicological studies showed favorable safety profiles and good tolerance. In conclusion, 4aa may be applied for novel therapeutic developments for patients with AD.",

Here, a differentially expressed PoWRKY71 gene that was highly expressed in drought-treated Paeonia ostii leaves was identified through transcriptome analysis. PoWRKY71 positively responded to drought stress with significantly enhanced expression patterns and overexpressing PoWRKY71 in tobacco greatly improved plant tolerance to drought stress, whereas silencing PoWRKY71 in P. ostii resulted in a drought-intolerant phenotype. Furthermore, lower chlorophyll contents, photosynthesis, and inhibited expression of photosynthesis-related light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding 151 (CAB151) gene were found in PoWRKY71-silenced P. ostii. Meanwhile, a homologous system indicated that drought treatment increased PoCAB151 promoter activity. Interactive assays revealed that PoWRKY71 directly bound on the W-box element of PoCAB151 promoter and activated its transcription. In addition, PoCAB151 overexpressing plants demonstrated increased drought tolerance, together with significantly higher chlorophyll contents and photosynthesis, whereas these indices were dramatically lower in PoCAB151-silenced P. ostii. The above results indicated that PoWRKY71 activated the expression of PoCAB151, thus stabilising photosynthesis via regulating chloroplast homeostasis and chlorophyll content in P. ostii under drought stress. This study reveals a novel drought-resistance mechanism in plants and provides a feasible strategy for improving plant drought resistance via stabilising photosynthesis."

      "abstract": "Harmful algal blooms (HABs) pose a severe environmental issue and have significant economic and ecological consequences on coastal oceans. Predicting the occurrence of these blooms has become increasingly vital for coastal communities. To facilitate this, chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) levels have been widely used to forecast algal blooms. Although Hydro-biogeochemical (HBGC) process-based models display reasonable accuracy in predicting hydrodynamic variables and nutrients, they are not as effective in predicting Chl-a. Purely data-driven machine learning techniques also have limitations in accurately predicting Chl-a of high spatio-temporal resolutions. In this study, a coupled HBGC-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was developed to predict the daily surface Chl-a distribution. The HBGC-CNN model integrates the information gathered by the HBGC model on temperature, salinity, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, dissolved organic phosphorus, and zooplankton with the remote sensing Chl-a products for the CNN model training. The results revealed that the HBGC-CNN model can effectively reproduce both daily and seasonal Chl-a variations, and interpret spatiotemporal information related to an HAB event triggered by the heavy rainfall during typhoon Lekima in 2019. Furthermore, this method can be used for data reconstruction, producing gap-free Chl-a products for historical reanalysis, especially in nearshore regions. The successful implementation of the HBGC-CNN model in predicting Chl-a highlights its potential in being incorporated into an operational forecasting system from a regional scale to a global scale, reducing the adverse impact of HAB disasters and facilitating emergency treatment.",

      "abstract": "Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) is the main lipid constituent of thylakoids and a structural component of photosystems and photosynthesis-related proteo-lipid complexes in green tissues. Previously reported changes in MGDG abundance upon stress treatments are hypothesized to reflect mobilization of MGDG-based polyunsaturated lipid intermediates to maintain extraplastidial membrane integrity. While exchange of lipid intermediates between compartmental membranes is well documented, physiological consequences of mobilizing an essential thylakoid lipid, such as MGDG, for an alternative purpose are not well understood. Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to mild (50 mM) salt treatment displayed significantly increased abundance of both MGDG and the extraplastidial lipid, phosphatidylcholine (PC). Interestingly, similar increases in MGDG and PC were observed in Arabidopsis fad3 mutant seedlings defective in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized linolenic acid formation, in which compensatory plastid-to-ER-directed mobilization of linolenic acid-containing intermediates takes place. The postulated (salt) or evident (fad3) plastid-ER exchange of intermediates concurred with altered thylakoid function according to parameters of photosynthetic performance. While salt treatment of wild-type seedlings inhibited photosynthetic parameters in a dose-dependent manner, interestingly, untreated fad3 mutants did not show overall reduced photosynthetic quantum yield. By contrast, we observed a reduction specifically of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) under high light, representing only part of observed salt effects. The decreased NPQ in the fad3 mutant was accompanied by reduced activity of the xanthophyll cycle, leading to a reduced concentration of the NPQ-effective pigment zeaxanthin. The findings suggest that altered ER-located fatty acid unsaturation and ensuing inter-organellar compensation impacts on the function of specific thylakoid enzymes, rather than globally affecting thylakoid function.",

To increase chlorophyll stability as well as other quality factors of limes, they were coated with beeswax in 0.1 wt.% and sodium nitroprusside in three various concentrations (0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mM) at 25 °C for 3 min and then stored at 8 °C for 60 days. In this research, changes in weight loss, juice content, firmness (F), chlorophyll, chlorophyllase activity, polyphenol oxidase activity, color, total acidity (titratable acidity), ascorbic acid (ASA) and sensory evaluation were studied. During storage at low temperatures, BW surface coating (0.1%) alone, sodium nitroprusside alone, and also in combination with each other and a double layer were effective in maintaining chlorophyll and the qualitative characteristics of limes. In our observations, the best treatment was the treatment where the limes were coated by beeswax enriched by sodium nitroprusside coating. This treatment contained the highest content of lime juice and the highest chlorophyll plus the lowest activity of chlorophyllase and polyphenol oxidase, while the amount of green color was maintained to a large extent. As a result, it is possible to use beeswax enriched by sodium nitroprusside coating method to maintain the quality and chlorophyll of cold-stored lime fruits."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Chilling injury is one of the most common meteorological disasters affecting cucumber production. For implementing remedial measures as soon as possible to minimize production loss, a timely and precise assessment of chilling injury is crucial. METHODS: To evaluate the possibility of detecting cucumber chilling injury using chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) technology, we investigated the continuous changes in ChlF parameters under various low-temperature conditions and created the criteria for evaluating chilling injury. The ChlF induction curves were first collected before low-temperature as unstressed samples and daily 1 to 5 days after low-temperature as chilling injury samples. Principal component analysis was employed to investigate the public information on ChlF parameters and evaluate the differences between samples with different degrees of chilling injury. The parameters (F v/F m, Y(NO), qP, and F o) accounted for a large proportion in the principal components and could characterize chilling injury. Uniform manifold approximation and projection method was employed to extract new features (Feature 1, Feature 2, Feature 3, and Feature 4) from ChlF parameters for subsequent classification model. Taking four features as input, a classification model based on the Fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm was constructed in order to identify the chilling injury classes of cucumber seedlings. The cucumber seedlings with different chilling injury classes were analyzed for ChlF images, rapid light curves, and malondialdehyde content. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results demonstrated that the variations in these indicators among the different chilling injury classes supported the validity of the classification model. Our findings provide a better understanding of the relationship between ChlF parameters and the impact of low-temperature treatment on cucumber seedlings. This finding offers an additional perspective that can be used to evaluate the responses and damage that plants experience under stress."

      "abstract": "Drought and cadmium (Cd) stress are both major issues that significantly affect the growth and development of wheat plants. Both drought stress and Cd toxicity disrupt physiological processes i.e., nutrient uptake, cell expansion, and enzymatic reactions resulting in poor crop growth. To overcome these issues, the use of activated carbon and gibberellic acid (GA3) are considered valuable amendments. However, the current study aimed to add value using GA3-enriched biochar (GA3-BC). That's why, a lab experiment was conducted on wheat to assess the effectiveness of GA3-BC against Cd and drought stress. For GA3 enrichment in biochar, 10 µg GA3/g biochar was mixed. There were 3 levels of GA3-BC i.e., 0, 0.6 (GA3-BC1), and 0.9% (GA3-BC). All levels were applied in 3 replicates under no stress (0Cd + no drought), drought stress (DS), and 6 mg Cd/ kg soil (6Cd). Results showed that GA3-BC2 caused a significant improvement in shoot length (44.99%), root length (99.73%), seedling length (60.13%) and shoot fresh weight (63.59%) over control at 6Cd + drought stress. A significant improvement in chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and total chlorophyll while a decrease in electrolyte leakage and regulation of antioxidants i.e., lipid peroxidation, SOD, CAT, APx, GR, GPx, GST, and DPHH also signified the effectiveness of GA3-BC2 compared to control at 6Cd + drought stress. In conclusion, GA3-BC2 is an efficacious amendment for simultaneously alleviating drought and Cd stress in wheat. More investigations are recommended at the field level on different cereal crops cultivated in different soil textures to declare GA3-BC2 as the best treatment for mitigation of drought stress and Cd toxicity.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is a worldwide epidemic and natural products may hold promise in its treatment. The chlorophyll derivative 13-2-hydroxypheophytine (hpa) was isolated in a screen with zebrafish larvae to identify lipid reducing molecules from cyanobacteria. However, the mechanisms underlying the lipid-reducing effects of hpa in zebrafish larvae remain poorly understood. Thus, investigating the mechanism of action of hpa and validation in other model organisms such as mice represents important initial steps. In this study, we identified 14 protein targets of hpa in zebrafish larvae by thermal proteome profiling, and selected two targets (malate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase) involved in cellular metabolism for further validation by enzymatic measurements. Our findings revealed a dose-dependent inhibition of pyruvate kinase by hpa exposure using protein extracts of zebrafish larvae in vitro, and in exposure experiments from 3 to 5 days post fertilization in vivo. Analysis of untargeted metabolomics of zebrafish larvae detected 940 mass peaks (66 increased, 129 decreased) and revealed that hpa induced the formation of various phospholipid species (phosphoinositol, phosphoethanolamine, phosphatidic acid). Inter-species validation showed that brown adipocytes exposed to hpa significantly reduced the size of lipid droplets, increased maximal mitochondrial respiratory capacity, and the expression of PPARy during adipocyte differentiation. In line with our data, previous work described that reduced pyruvate kinase activity lowered hepatic lipid content via reduced pyruvate and citrate, and improved mitochondrial function via phospholipids. Thus, our data provide new insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the lipid reducing activities of hpa in zebrafish larvae, and species overlapping functions in reduction of lipids.",

However, the effects of REEs on the photosynthesis of rice have not been thoroughly explored. Therefore, this study emphasizes how high levels of La(III) affect the thylakoid membrane of rice seedlings, thereby inhibiting photosynthesis and growth. Here, we reported that rice plants treated with La(III) exhibited an increase in La accumulation in the leaves, accompanied by a decrease in chlorophyll content and photosynthetic capacity. La(III) exposure decreased Mg content in leaves, but possibly increased other nutrients including Cu, Mn, and Zn through systemic endocytosis. K-band and L-band appeared in the fluorescence OJIP transients, indicating La(III) stress destroyed the donor and receptor sides of photosystem II (PSII). Numerous reaction centers (RC/CSm) were inactivated by La(III) treatment, which resulted in a reduction in electron transport capacity (decreased ETo/RC and ETo/CSm) and an increase in the dissipation of the excess excitation energy by heat (increased DIo/RC and DIo/CSm). The BN-PAGE analysis of thylakoid membrane protein complexes showed that La(III) induced the degradation of supercomplexes, PSII core, LHCII, PSI core, LHCI, and F1-ATPase binding Cyt b6f complex. Collectively, this study revealed that La(III) causes significant degradation of thylakoid membrane proteins, thereby promoting the decomposition of photosynthetic complexes, ultimately destroying the chloroplast structure and reducing the photosynthetic performance of rice seedlings.",

      "abstract": "Sargent's cherry trees (Prunus sargentiiRehder) are widely planted as an ornamental, climate change-sensing species. This study investigated changes in the soil moisture content, fresh weight, photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence properties, and the chlorophyll and proline content of four-year-old P. sargentii seedlings after 30 days of drought stress. In the trees subjected to drought stress treatment, soil moisture content decreased, and the fresh weight of the aboveground part of the plant decreased. However, there was no significant difference in the root growth of the dried plants. Among the photosynthesis parameters, Pn MAX, E and gs showed a significant (p  <  0.001) decrease after 15 days in dry-stressed seedlings, but there was no difference between treatments in WUE until 20 days, and there was a significant (p  <  0.001) difference after 24 days. Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, Fv/Fm, ΦPSII, Rfd, NPQ, and Pn MAX, also increased after 10 days in dry-stressed seedlings, but these changes did not reach statistical significance compared to the control treatment. These results may suggest that drought stress highly correlates with photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. Chlorophyll content also significantly decreased in the seedlings under drought stress compared with the control treatment. The proline content decreased until the 10th day of drought stress treatment and increased after the 15th day, showing an increase of 10.9% on the 15th day and 57.1% on the 30th day, compared to the control treatment. These results suggest that photosynthesis, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, and proline content can be used to evaluate drought stress in trees. The results of this study can contribute to the management of forests, such as the irrigation of trees when pore control ability and photosynthesis ability decrease.",

      "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic heavy metal that significantly threatens plants and the environment. Its toxicity in plants can result in various adverse effects, including reduced growth, altered metabolism, and cell damage. Cadmium can also interfere with nutrient uptake, particularly zinc (Zn), leading to Zn deficiency and further exacerbating Cd toxicity. On the other hand, foliar application of zinc might be a useful strategy to mitigate cadmium (Cd) toxicity in plants. Hence, a pot experiment was conducted with three replications. The wheat plants were treated with various concentrations of Zn as a foliar spray (control, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.5%) in Cd-spiked soil in pots. The results showed that foliar use of Zn at 0.4 or 0.5% resulted in higher plant height, grain yield, and dry matter yield than the control group. Using Zn as foliar spray enriched shoot and grain Zn content while reducing Cd content in the shoot and grain. The leaf's electrolyte leakage (EL) decreased by 15.4, 29.8, 40.7, and 45.9% in the Zn 0.1%, Zn 0.2%, Zn 0.4%, and Zn 0.5% treatments, respectively, compared to the control treatment. Regarding superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, Zn 0.5% treatment showed a decrease of 42.9% over control. Specifically, the Zn 0.1% showed a 27.2%, Zn 0.2% showed a 56.8%, Zn 0.4% showed a 91.1%, and Zn 0.5% showed a 133.7% increase in total chlorophyll content than control. Based on the results, it is recommended that 0.4% Zn solution may be used for foliar application for enhancing crop productivity and Zn concentration in plants under high Cd stress. Additionally, continued research on the mechanisms of cadmium uptake, transport, and detoxification in plants may lead to the identification of new targets for intervention."

In this study, 19 PpLhc genes were identified in the peach genome database, which were unevenly distributed on all chromosomes. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that PpLhc proteins could be divided into three major subfamilies, each of whose members had different exon-intron structures but shared similar conserved motifs. A total of 17 different kinds of cis-regulatory elements were identified in the promoter regions of all PpLhc genes, which could be classified into three categories: plant growth and development, stress response, and phytohormone response. In addition, transcriptomic data analysis and RT-qPCR results revealed that the expression profiles of some PpLhc genes changed under drought treatment, suggesting the crucial roles of Lhc genes in the regulation of plant tolerance to drought stress. Taken together, these findings will provide valuable information for future functional studies of PpLhc genes, especially in response to drought stress.",

Complete inhibition of electron transport was observed in plants treated with high Hg concentrations, and the quantum yield of primary photochemistry and the ratio of dissipated energy to absorption both decreased with increasing Hg concentrations. Performance Index (PI) was significantly affected by the Hg concentrations, reaching zero in plants treated with the highest Hg concentration.

Breeding plants for tolerance against HL is therefore highly demanded. Chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) is a sensitive indicator of stress in plants and can be evaluated using OJIP transients. In this study, we compared the ChlF features of plants exposed to HL (1200 μmol m-2 s-1) with that of control plants (300 μmol m-2 s-1). To extract the most reliable ChlF features for discrimination between HL-stressed and non-stressed plants, we applied three artificial neural network (ANN)-based algorithms, namely, Boruta, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). Feature selection algorithms identified multiple features but only two features, namely the maximal quantum yield of PSII photochemistry (FV/FM) and quantum yield of energy dissipation (ɸD0), remained consistent across all genotypes in control conditions, while exhibited variation in HL. Therefore, considered reliable features for HL stress screening. The selected features were then used for screening 14 tomato genotypes for HL. Genotypes were categorized into three groups, tolerant, semi-tolerant, and sensitive genotypes. Foliar hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were measured as independent proxies for benchmarking selected features. Tolerant genotypes were attributed with the lowest change in H2O2 and MDA contents, while the sensitive genotypes displayed the highest magnitude of increase in H2O2 and MDA by HL treatment compared to the control. Finally, a FV/FM higher than 0.77 and ɸD0 lower than 0.24 indicates a healthy electron transfer chain (ETC) when tomato plants are exposed to HL.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies found that 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and abscisic acid (ABA) can mitigate damage from adversity by enhancing photosynthesis. However, it is not clear whether they have positive effects on iron utilization and chlorophyll synthesis of tomato seedlings under low-temperature stress. To investigate the possible functional relationship between ABA and ALA and elucidate the possible mechanisms of action of ALA to alleviate low-temperature stress in tomato seedlings, this experiment analyzed the effects of ALA and ABA on chlorophyll synthesis in tomato seedling leaves sprayed with exogenous of ALA (25 mg·L-1) or ABA (100 µM) under low-temperature stress (8-18 °C/8-12 °C, day/night). The results show that exogenous ALA increased the Fv/Fm of tomato leaves by 5.31% and increased the accumulation of iron and chlorophyll by 101.15% and 15.18%, respectively, compared to the low-temperature treatment alone, and tomato resistance of low-temperature stress was enhanced. Meanwhile, exogenous application of ALA increased the ABA content by 39.43%, and subsequent application of exogenous ABA revealed that tomato seedlings showed similar effects to exogenous ALA under low-temperature stress, with increased accumulation of iron and chlorophyll in tomato seedlings, which eventually increased the maximum photochemical efficiency of PS II. Under low-temperature stress, application of exogenous ABA significantly reduced ALA content, but the expression of key enzyme genes (PPGD, HEMB1, HEME1, and HEMF1), precursors of chlorophyll synthesis by ALA, was significantly elevated, presumably because the increased activity of these enzymes after external application of ABA accelerated ALA consumption. In conclusion, ABA may crosstalk with ALA to improve the photochemical efficiency and low temperature resistance of tomatoes by regulating chlorophyll synthesis and iron accumulation.",

Chlorophyll fluorescence is one of the most important indicators of the extent to which plants are affected by their environment. There are few reports on the effects of changes in exogenous calcium levels on the chlorophyll fluorescence properties of Fraxinus malacophylla seedlings. In the present study, we investigated the growth, chlorophyll fluorescence properties and antioxidant system of Fraxinus malacophylla seedlings in response to exogenous calcium (as the concentrations of 0, 25, 50, 75 mmol L-1). The results showed that Ca2+ concentration (25-50 mmol L-1) treatment mainly promoted the growth, biomass accumulation, root activity, and chlorophyll synthesis and effect on chlorophyll fluorescence in Fraxinus malacophylla; the developed root system became a strong linking hub for calcium adaptation. In addition, the activities of the antioxidant enzymes peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) are upregulated and play an important role in preventing excessive oxidative damage. OJIP test parameters changed significantly with the addition of exogenous calcium, and parameters related to each photosystem II (PSII) reaction centre, such as ABS/RC and DIo/RC, increased significantly in the OJIP test, with enhanced function of the PSII electron donor lateral oxygen evolution complex. In conclusion, the addition of exogenous calcium (25-50 mmol L-1) had an important protective effect on the photosynthetic mechanism of Fraxinus malacophylla, promoting photosynthesis, better growth and better adaptability.",

      "abstract": "The widely conserved Receptor for Activated C Kinase1 (RACK1) protein is a WD-40 type scaffold protein that regulates diverse environmental stress signal transduction pathways. Arabidopsis RACK1A has been reported to interact with various proteins in salt stress and Light-Harvesting Complex (LHC) pathways. However, the mechanism of how RACK1 contributes to the photosystem and chlorophyll metabolism in stress conditions remains elusive. In this study, using T-DNA-mediated activation tagging transgenic rice (Oryza sativa L.) lines, we show that leaves from rice RACK1B gene (OsRACK1B) gain-of-function (RACK1B-OX) plants exhibit the stay-green phenotype under salinity stress. In contrast, leaves from down-regulated OsRACK1B (RACK1B-UX) plants display an accelerated yellowing. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that several genes which encode chlorophyll catabolic enzymes (CCEs) are differentially expressed in both RACK1B-OX and RACK1B-UX rice plants. In addition to CCEs, stay-green (SGR) is a key component that forms the SGR-CCE complex in senescing chloroplasts, and which causes LHCII complex instability. Transcript and protein profiling revealed a significant upregulation of OsSGR in RACK1B-UX plants compared to that in RACK1B-OX rice plants during salt treatment. The results imply that senescence-associated transcription factors (TFs) are altered following altered OsRACK1B expression, indicating a transcriptional reprogramming by OsRACK1B and a novel regulatory mechanism involving the OsRACK1B-OsSGR-TFs complex. Our findings suggest that the ectopic expression of OsRACK1B negatively regulates chlorophyll degradation, leads to a steady level of LHC-II isoform Lhcb1, an essential prerequisite for the state transition of photosynthesis for adaptation, and delays salinity-induced senescence. Taken together, these results provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms of salinity-induced senescence, which can be useful in circumventing the effect of salt on photosynthesis and in reducing the yield penalty of important cereal crops, such as rice, in global climate change conditions."

However, their spectrum of action varies significantly, from beneficial stimulation to toxicity, depending on the type of NPs, the concentration used and plant genotypic diversity. Photosynthetic performance can be assessed through chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChlF) measurements. These data allow to indirectly obtain detailed information about primary light reactions, thylakoid electron transport reactions, dark enzymatic stroma reactions, slow regulatory processes, processes at the pigment level. It makes possible, together with leaf reflectance performance, to evaluate photosynthesis sensitivity to stress stimuli. RESULTS: We investigated effects of different metal and metal(oid) oxide nanoparticles on photosynthesis of oakleaf lettuce seedlings by monitoring the chlorophyll a fluorescence light radiation and reflectance from the leaves. Observations of ChlF parameters and changes in leaf morphology were carried out for 9 days in two-day intervals. Spectrophotometric studies were performed at 9th day. Suspensions of NPs with the following concentrations were used: 6% TiO2, SiO2; 3% CeO2, SnO2, Fe2O3; 0.004% (40 ppm) Ag; 0.002% (20 ppm) Au. Nanoparticles were applied directly on the leaves which caused small symptoms of chlorosis, necrosis and leaf veins deformation, but the plants fully recovered to the initial morphological state at 9th day. Leaf reflectance analysis showed an increase in FRI for SiO2-NPs and CeO2-NPs treatments and ARI2 for Fe2O3, however, WBI and PRI coefficients for the latter nanoparticle were lower than in control. Chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters have changed due to NPs treatment. Fe2O3-NPs caused an increase in Fv/F0, PIABS, ET0/RC, DI0/RC, ABS/RC in different time points in comparison to control, also Ag, Au and SnO2 treatment caused an increase in Fv/F0, PIABS or ET0/RC, respectively. On the other hand, TiO2-NPs caused a decrease in Fv/Fm and Fv/F0 parameters, but an increase in DI0/RC value was observed. SnO2-NPs decreased PIABS, but increased ET0/RC than compared to control. Nanoparticles affected the shape of the O-J-I-P curve in slight manner, however, further analyses showed unfavourable changes within the PSII antenna, manifested by a slowdown in the transport of electrons between the Chl molecules of the light-harvesting complex II and the active center of PSII due to NPs application. CONCLUSION: Changes in ChlF parameters and leaf reflectance values clearly proved the significant influence of NPs on the functioning of the photosynthetic apparatus, especially right after NPs application. The nature of these changes was strictly depended on the type of nanoparticles and sometimes underwent very significant changes over time. The greatest changes in ChlF parameters were caused by Fe2O3 nanoparticles, followed by TiO2-NPs. After slight response of O-J-I-P curves to treatment of the plants with NPs the course of the light phase of photosynthesis stabilized and at 9th day were comparable to the control curve.",

      "abstract": "Cyclocarya paliurus has been traditionally used as a functional food in China. A hydroponic experiment was conducted to determine the effects of N and P additions on photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) of C. paliurus seedlings. N and P additions significantly altered photosynthesis and ChlF in the seedlings, but responses of these parameters to the N and P concentrations varied at different developmental stages. The greatest net photosynthetic rate (P N) and actual photochemical efficiency of PSII (ФPSII) occurred in the treatment of 150.0 mg(N) L-1 and 25.0 mg(P) L-1 addition, whereas the highest maximum quantum yield of PSII (Fv/Fm) and water-use efficiency (WUE) were recorded with 150.0 mg(N) L-1 and 15.0 mg(P) L-1 on the 60th day after treatment. Significantly positive correlations of P N with leaf relative chlorophyll content, transpiration rate, WUE, Fv/Fm, and ΦPSII, as well as the ФPSII with the Fv/Fm, were found. Our results indicated that an optimal addition of N and P nutrients depends on their coupling effects on the photosynthetic capacity and PSII photochemistry."

After MeJA treatment, rice plants displayed evidence of great oxidative stress regarding senescence symptoms, disruption of membrane integrity, H2O2 production, and decreased chlorophyll content and photosynthetic efficiency. After 6 h of MeJA treatment, plants greatly decreased not only their levels of chlorophyll precursors, including protoporphyrin IX (Proto IX), Mg-Proto IX, Mg-Proto IX methylester, and protochlorophyllide, but also the expression levels of the chlorophyll biosynthetic genes CHLD, CHLH, CHLI, and PORB, with the greatest decreases at 78 h. MeJA-treated plants showed a noticeable degradation of light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding proteins (LHCB) at 78 h after MeJA treatment but began to downregulate expression of LHCB at 6 h. Photoprotection, as indicated by nonphotochemical quenching, slightly increased only at 6 h after MeJA treatment. In parallel to the increased activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and peroxidase, MeJA-treated plants responded to senescence by markedly upregulating the expression of APX and CAT. Our study demonstrates that rice plants developed protective mechanisms for mitigating oxidative stress by scavenging phototoxic chlorophyll precursors and activating enzymatic antioxidant responses during MeJA-induced senescence.",

Nitric oxide (NO) is a multifunctional plant growth regulator, but the effect of preharvest application of NO on the storage quality of Chinese flowering cabbage remains unclear. Preharvest application of 50 mg L-1 sodium nitroprusside (SNP, a NO donor) to the roots obviously reduced leaf yellowing in Chinese flowering cabbage during storage. Proteomic analysis reveals 198 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in SNP-treated plants compared to the control. The main DEPs were significantly enriched in chlorophyll metabolisms, phenylpropanoid synthesis, and antioxidant pathways. SNP treatment enhanced chlorophyll biosynthesis and suppressed chlorophyll-degradation-related proteins and genes. It also modulated flavonoid-biosynthesis-related genes, and 21 significantly regulated flavonoids were identified in SNP-treated plants. The enhanced antioxidant capacity in SNP-treated plants was able to decrease chlorophyll catabolism by inhibiting peroxidase-mediated chlorophyll bleaching. Collectively, preharvest SNP treatment modulated chlorophyll metabolism and preserved chlorophyll content in leaves during storage. Moreover, SNP treatment enhanced flavonoid synthesis, suppressed reactive oxygen species accumulation, and delayed the senescence process, thereby maintaining leaf greening in Chinese flowering cabbage. These findings highlight the role of exogenous NO in alleviating yellowing of leafy vegetables.",

The presence of copper in storage or in packaging brines both contributed significantly to maintaining the green color of the olives, which was associated with a specific pattern of chlorophyll derivatives, as evidenced by principal component analysis. Notably, re-greening was rapidly achievable also for olives that had yellowed for 18 months at a copper concentration below the limit of EU legislation.

Replacing iodine with fluorine in PSs did not make any significant difference in fluorescence and singlet oxygen (a key cytotoxic agent) production. The nature of the delivery vehicle and tumor types showed a significant difference in uptake and long-term cure by photodynamic therapy (PDT), especially in the iodinated PS. An unexpected difference in the pharmacokinetic profiles of fluorinated vs. iodinated PSs was observed. At the same imaging parameters, the fluorinated PSs showed maximal tumor uptake at 2 h post injection of the PS, whereas the iodinated PS gave the highest uptake at 24 h post injection. Among all isomers, the m-fluoro PS showed the best in vivo anti-cancer activity in mice bearing U87 (brain) or bladder (UMUC3) tumors. A direct correlation between the tumor uptake and PDT efficacy was observed. The higher tumor uptake of m-fluoro PS at two hours post injection provides a solid rationale for developing the corresponding 18F-agent (half-life 110 min only) for positron imaging tomography (PET) of those cancers (e.g., bladder, prostate, kidney, pancreas, and brain) where 18F-FDG-PET shows limitations.",

      "abstract": "Seed priming is an effective and novel technique and the use of eco-friendly biological agents improves the physiological functioning in the vegetative stage of plants. This procedure ensures productivity and acquired stress resilience in plants against adverse conditions without contaminating the environment. Though the mechanisms of bio-priming-triggered alterations have been widely explained under induvial stress conditions, the interaction of combined stress conditions on the defense system and the functionality of photosynthetic apparatus in the vegetative stage after the inoculation to seeds has not been fully elucidated. After Bacillus pumilus inoculation to wheat seeds (Triticum aestivum), three-week-old plants were hydroponically exposed to the alone and combination of salt (100 mM NaCl) and 200 μM sodium arsenate (Na2HAsO4·7H2O, As) for 72 h. Salinity and As pollutant resulted in a decline in growth, water content, gas exchange parameters, fluorescence kinetics and performance of photosystem II (PSII). On the other hand, the seed inoculation against stress provided the alleviation of relative growth rate (RGR), relative water content (RWC) and chlorophyll fluorescence. Since there was no effective antioxidant capacity, As and/or salinity caused the induction of H2O2 accumulation and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances content (TBARS) in wheat . The inoculated seedlings had a high activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) under stress. B. pumilis decreased the NaCl-induced toxic H2O2 levels by increasing peroxidase (POX) and enzymes/non-enzymes related to ascorbate-glutathione (AsA-GSH) cycle. In the presence of As exposure, the inoculated plants exhibited an induction in CAT activity. On the other hand, for H2O2 scavenging, the improvement in the AsA-GSH cycle was observed in bacterium priming plants plus the combined stress treatment. Since B. pumilus inoculation reduced H2O2 levels against all stress treatments, lipid peroxidation subsequently decreased in wheat leaves. The findings obtained from our study explained that the seed inoculation with B. pumilus provided an activation in the defense system and protection in growth, water status, and gas exchange regulation in wheat plants against the combination of salt and As.",

However, the effect of auxin on the metabolism of chlorophyll, one of the most important pigments involved in the photosynthesis, was intertwined and the underlying mechanism remained to be explored. Here, we found the auxin-defective yuc2 yuc6 double mutant displayed dark-green leaf color with higher chlorophyll content than wildtype, suggesting a negative regulatory role of auxin in chlorophyll biosynthesis. The chloroplast number and structure in mesophyll cells were altered and the photosynthetic efficiency was improved in yuc2 yuc6. In addition, the chlorophyll level was significantly improved during seedling de-etiolation in yuc2 yuc6 mutant, and decreased dramatically under IAA treatment, confirming the inhibitory role of auxin in chlorophyll biosynthesis. The analyses of gene expression in mature leaves and de-etiolation seedlings suggested that auxin suppressed the expression of many chlorophyll biosynthesis genes, especially PROTOCHLOROPHYLLIDE OXIDOREDUCTASE A (PORA) and GENOMES UNCOUPLED 5 (GUN5). Yeast-one-hybrid and luciferase assays demonstrated that the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 2 (ARF2) and ARF7 bind to the promoter of PORA and GUN5 to suppress their expression with the help of INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID14 (IAA14). Collectively, our research explicitly unraveled the direct inhibitory role of auxin in chlorophyll biosynthesis, and provided new insight into the interplay between auxin signaling and chlorophyll metabolism."

      "abstract": "The Mediterranean is among the regions predicted to be most affected by climate change due to rising temperatures and increasing frequency as well as intensity of extreme weather events, such as drought. These shifts in climatic conditions might lead to changes in species community composition by enabling the increase of drought-tolerant species at the expense of less tolerant ones. This hypothesis was tested in the current study using chlorophyll fluorescence data from a 21-year precipitation exclusion experiment in a Mediterranean forest for two co-dominant Quercus ilex L. and Phillyrea latifolia L. species with contrasting low and high levels of drought tolerance, respectively. The maximum potential quantum efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) (Fv/Fm), photochemical efficiency of PSII (yield) and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) varied seasonally. The Fv/Fm and NPQ levels were positively correlated with air temperature and standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI), whereas yield, which was greater under drought treatment, was negatively associated with vapor pressure deficit and SPEI. The Fv/Fm values showed similar increase in the two species over the 21-year study period regardless of treatment and in parallel to progressive warming. By contrast, yield values were higher in Q. ilex than in P. latifolia, while NPQ values were higher in P. latifolia than in Q. ilex. Notably, high yield values were also observed in the drought-treated plots. Throughout the study, plants in the drought-treated plots exhibited decreased basal area, leaf biomass and aerial cover due to high stem mortality. In addition, a continuous increase in temperature was detected in summer and autumn, which might explain the observed increase in Fv/Fm values over the study period. Higher yield and lower NPQ detected in Q. ilex could be attributed to less competition for resources in the drought-treated plots and acclimation of Q. ilex plants over the study period. Our results indicate that reduction in stem density could improve forest resilience to climate change-induced drought conditions.",

BnMYB69 RNA interference (BnMYB69i) plants showed considerable changes in morphology, anatomy, metabolism and gene expression. Stem diameter, leaves, roots and total biomass were distinctly larger, but plant height was significantly reduced. Contents of lignin, cellulose and protopectin in stems were significantly reduced, accompanied with decrease in bending resistance and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum resistance. Anatomical detection observed perturbation in vascular and fiber differentiation in stems, but promotion in parenchyma growth, accompanied with changes in cell size and cell number. In shoots, contents of IAA, shikimates and proanthocyanidin were reduced, while contents of ABA, BL and leaf chlorophyll were increased. qRT-PCR revealed changes in multiple pathways of primary and secondary metabolisms. IAA treatment could recover many phenotypes and metabolisms of BnMYB69i plants. However, roots showed trends opposite to shoots in most cases, and BnMYB69i phenotypes were light-sensitive. Conclusively, BnMYB69s might be light-regulated positive regulators of shikimates-related metabolisms, and exert profound influences on various internal and external plant traits."

The antioxidant capabilities of both classes of lipophilic substances have been researched since disrupting antioxidant equilibrium appears to be linked to the development of several diseases. Methods This research aimed to evaluate the effect of injection with chlorophyll (30 and 60 mg/ml) on enhancing the blood parameters of rats. Twenty-one white male rats were included in this study and divided into three groups: control, 30 mg/ml, and 60 mg/ml.  Results Treatment with liquid chlorophyll significantly increased white blood cells (WBCs), red blood cells (RBCs), granulocytes, lymphocytes, hemoglobin (Hgb), hematocrit (Hct), mean corpuscular Hgb concentration (MCHC), and platelets. However, it nonsignificantly increased mean corpuscular volume (MCV). These results confirm a great increase in important hematological parameters in response to exogenous injectable chlorophyll with concentrations of 30 and 60 mg/ml and at two different time points, 14 and 28 days after injection. The platelet count was significantly (p<0.001) increased after 30 mg/ml and 60 mg/ml. Conclusion These results show a significant increase in important hematological parameters in response to exogenous injectable chlorophyll. The liquid chlorophyll is recommended to increase blood parameters and improve blood characteristics avoiding anemia."

      "abstract": "The efficiency of photosynthesis in strawberry plants is measured to maintain the quality and quantity of strawberries produced. The latest method used to measure the photosynthetic status of plants is chlorophyll fluorescence imaging (CFI), which has the advantage of obtaining plant spatiotemporal data non-destructively. This study developed a CFI system to measure the maximum quantum efficiency of photochemistry (Fv/Fm). The main components of this system include a chamber for plants to adapt to dark environments, blue LED light sources to excite the chlorophyll in plants, and a monochrome camera with a lens filter attached to capture the emission spectra. In this study, 120 pots of strawberry plants were cultivated for 15 days and divided into four treatment groups: control, drought stress, heat stress, and a combination of drought and heat stress, resulting in Fv/Fm values of 0.802 ± 0.0036, 0.780 ± 0.0026, 0.768 ± 0.0023, and 0.749 ± 0.0099, respectively. A strong correlation was found between the developed system and a chlorophyll meter (r = 0.75). These results prove that the developed CFI system can accurately capture the spatial and temporal dynamics resulting from the response of strawberry plants to abiotic stresses."

      "abstract": "Cd pollution is a global environmental problem. However, the response mechanism of the alpine plant Pelagia under Cd stress remains unclear. Therefore, in this study, a native plant(Elymus nutans Griseb.) of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was used as the material to quantify plant height, leaf number, length of leaf, crown width, root number, biomass, Dry weight malondialdehyde (MDA), free proline, superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate enzyme (APX), catalase (CAT) and chlorophyll contents under different Cd concentrations. The results showed that the growth of Elymus nutans Griseb. was a phenomenon of \"low concentration promotes growth, high concentration inhibited growth\" under Cd treatment. It meant that 10 mg·L-1 Cd promoted the growth of leaf number, plant height, crown width and tiller number, while 40 mg·L-1 Cd inhibited the growth of root number and biomass of Elymus nutans Griseb. compare with the control. The MDA content, free proline content, SOD activity, APX activity and CAT activity of Elymus nutans Griseb. was increased with the increase of Cd treatment concentration to resist the oxidative damage caused by Cd to the body. At the same time, the accumulation of chlorophyll A, chlorophyll B and chlorophyll AB was decreased with the increase of Cd stress concentration. In addition, the carotenoid content did not change much between the control group and the treatment group, indicating that Cd treatment had little effect on it. The results could provide a reference for the mechanism of heavy metal resistance and the selection and improvement of Cd -resistant varieties of Elymus nutans Griseb.",

Herein, we reported that cold treatment accelerated chlorophyll degradation of postharvest banana fruit at 30 °C, which was associated with the upregulated expression of MaCBR (Chlorophyll b reductase) and MaSGR1 (Stay-green 1). Moreover, cold treatment increased the expression of C-repeat binding factor MaCBF1. MaCBF1 bound directly to the promoters of MaCBR and MaSGR1 and activated their expressions. More importantly, transient expression of MaCBF1 in bananas enhanced chlorophyll degradation and weakened the repression of de-greening caused by high temperature. In summary, the cold treatment promotes chlorophyll catabolism by activating MaCBF1-induced transcriptional activation of MaCBR and MaSGR1, and attenuates high temperature-caused green ripening in bananas. These results study expand the understanding of the molecular events of high temperature-inhibited chlorophyll degradation and provide a feasible strategy to alleviate green ripening of banana fruit.",

      "abstract": "Melatonin is a growth regulator that improves the growth and chlorophyll (chl) content in plants. This study aims to investigate the effect of melatonin pretreatment on chl synthesis and fluorescence parameters in Malva parviflora exposed to cadmium (Cd). The 42-day-old plants were transferred to nutrient solutions containing 50 μM melatonin. After two days, some plants were exposed to 50 μM Cd. Eight days after Cd treatment, some indicators related to chl fluorescence and some biochemical parameters were measured. In this study, melatonin increased chl content and chl a/pheophytin a (pheo a) ratio, chlorophyllide a (chlide a), porphyrin compounds, and 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) in the presence of Cd. However, it decreased chl a/chlide a ratio under these conditions. Whereas Cd treatment resulted in significant reductions in photochemical activity and electron transfer rate in PSII, melatonin improved photochemical efficiency of PSII by reducing the toxic effect of Cd on the activity of the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) on the electron donor site and reducing non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). Based on the results, it appears that melatonin can maintain the chl content of plants exposed to Cd by increasing the precursors of the chl biosynthesis pathway and reducing its degradation rate. These results may, at least in our experimental conditions, partly explain the reason for the improved yield and growth of Cd-exposed plants when pretreated with melatonin."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Biocrust communities, which are important regulators of multiple ecosystem functions in drylands, are highly sensitive to climate change. There is growing evidence of the negative impacts of warming on the performance of biocrust constituents like lichens in the field. Here, we aim to understand the physiological basis behind this pattern. METHODS: Using a unique manipulative climate change experiment, we monitored every 30 minutes and for 9 months the chlorophyll a fluorescence and microclimatic conditions (lichen surface temperature, relative moisture and photosynthetically active radiation) of Psora decipiens, a key biocrust constituent in drylands worldwide. This long-term monitoring resulted in 11,847 records at the thallus-level, which allowed us to evaluate the impacts of ~2.3 °C simulated warming treatment on the physiology of Psora at an unprecedented level of detail. RESULTS: Simulated warming and the associated decrease in relative moisture promoted by this treatment negatively impacted the physiology of Psora, especially during the diurnal period of the spring, when conditions are warmer and drier. These impacts were driven by a mechanism based on the reduction of the length of the periods allowing net photosynthesis, and by declines in Yield and Fv/Fm under simulated warming. CONCLUSION: Our study reveals the physiological basis explaining observed negative impacts of ongoing global warming on biocrust-forming lichens in the field. The functional response observed could limit the growth and cover of biocrust-forming lichens in drylands in the long-term, negatively impacting in key soil attributes such as biogeochemical cycles, water balance, biological activity and ability of controlling erosion.

Herein, CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and photodynamic strategy for a synergistic anti-tumor therapeutic modality is merged. Chlorophyll (Chl) extracted from natural green vegetables is encapsulated in Pluronic F127 (F127) micelles and Histidine-tagged Cas9 can be effectively chelated onto micelles via metal coordination by simple incubation, affording Cas9-Chl@F127 micelles. Mg2+ acts as an enzyme cofactor to correlatively enhance Cas9 gene-editing activity. Upon laser irradiation, Chl as an effective photosensitizer generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill tumor cells. Meanwhile, CRISPR/Cas9, mediated by dual deliberately designed gRNAs of APE1 and NRF2, can reprogram the tumor microenvironment by increasing the intracellular oxygen accumulation and impairing the oxidative defense system of tumor cells. Cas9-Chl@F127 micelles can responsively release Cas9 in the presence of abundant ATP or low pH in tumor cells. In a murine tumor model, Cas9-Chl@F127 complexed with dual gRNAs including APE1 and NRF2 significantly inhibits the tumor growth. Taken together, Cas9-Chl@F127 micelles, representing the first Chl-based green biomaterial for the delivery of Cas9, show great promise for the synergistic anti-tumor treatment by PDT and gene editing.",

However, it is not clear how postharvest treatment with 6-BA at various concentrations affects the quality of Chinese flowering cabbage. In this study, harvested Chinese flowering cabbage was foliar sprayed with 6-BA solution at concentrations of 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg·L-1. All 6-BA treatments protected the quality of Chinese flowering cabbage during storage, and the treatment with 20 and 40 mg·L-1 6-BA showed the most obvious effect. Treatment with 6-BA reduced leaf yellowing degree and weight loss rate; maintained high chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b contents; suppressed the declines in ascorbic acid and soluble protein; enhanced antioxidant capacity; and reduced oxidative damage in cabbage leaves. Furthermore, 6-BA treatment upregulated the expression of antioxidant genes and the activities of SOD, POD, and CAT, while inhibiting the expression of senescence-related gene (BrSAG12) and chlorophyll catabolic genes (BrPAO, BrPPH, BrSGR1, BrNYC1, BrRCCR). These results suggest that postharvest 6-BA treatment enhances antioxidant capacity, delays leaf senescence, and inhibits chlorophyll degradation, thereby maintaining the quality of Chinese flowering cabbage during storage. The findings of this study provide a candidate method for preserving Chinese flowering cabbage after harvest."

In this study, the effect of the population density of O. lybicus on chlorophyll, measured by the soil plant analysis development (SPAD) chlorophyll meter, palm biomass, and the nutritional composition of date palms, were investigated. A further objective was to determine significant relationships between the population density of O. lybicus, the number of honeydew droplets, and oviposited eggs. Reductions of up to 8-11% and 29-34% in chlorophyll content and plant biomass, respectively, were caused by infestations exceeding 300 nymphs per palm seedling. Increasing the population density of O. lybicus to 600 insects per palm decreased oviposition by females, suggesting intraspecific competition for resources. There was a significant relationship between honeydew droplets produced by the pest population and chlorophyll content in the rachis, suggesting that treatment can be triggered at 3-6 nymphs/leaflet. Egg oviposition was preferentially on the rachis. Ca, Mg, K, and P were the main nutrients affected by the activity of the pest. Mg content was associated with reduced chlorophyll content under increasing pest density, suggesting that supplemental nutrition can be potentially utilized to sustain chlorophyll and increase palm tolerance to pest infestation."

Thus, plant growth, uptake and translocation of Cd mediated by soil applied ZnONPs and foliar applied MT were investigated in wheat grown in Cd polluted soil under ambient conditions. The results depicted that ZnONPs stimulated the growth, chlorophyll contents, and yield of wheat in a dose additive way and this effect was further increased with foliar application of MT. 100 mg/kg of ZnONPs alone enhanced the grain yield by 60.5 % and this increase was about 177.5 % under combined ZnONPs and 100 μM MT treatment. ZnONPs treatments decreased Cd concentration whereas increased zinc (Zn) concentrations in shoots, roots, husks and grains and the effect was further increased with exogenous MT combined with NPs in a dose-additive way. 50 and 100 mg/kg ZnONPs treatments alone decreased grain Cd by 6.5 %, and 20 % and increased the Zn concentration by 20.1 % and 24 % than control. 100 mg/kg ZnONPs +100 μM MT treatment decreased the grain Cd by 63.5 % and increased grain Zn by 51 % than control treatment. Total Cd uptake (tissues biomass × Cd concentration in respective tissues) in shoots, roots, husks and grains increased with ZnONPs alone or combined with MT than control whereas soil post-harvest bioavailable Cd concentration decreased with treatments than control. The Cd reduction in grains was due to increase in biomass and Zn concentration thereby decreasing bioavailable Cd in soil and its accumulation in plants. This study suggested that combined use of ZnONPs and MT may provide new approaches for minimizing Cd and biofortification of Zn in edible parts of plants.",

Superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA), solution protein (SP), and proline (PRO) initially increased and then decreased. The activities and contents of these parameters were higher in the 0.40% and 0.60% NaCl treatments than in the 0.20% treatment and in the 0% control. M. zumi was the most resistant to salt stress, showing the lowest content of MDA in the leaves and roots, which increased slightly under salt stress. M. baccata had the highest increase in both the content and proportion of MDA. High enzyme activity was shown to play an important role in the salt resistance of M. zumi. Moreover, it can be speculated that there are other substances that also play a major role. We found that osmotic regulation played a key role in response to salt stress for M. baccata even though it was sensitive to salt stress. For M. sieversii, both the osmotic regulation and enzymatic antioxidants were observed to play a major role in mitigating salt stress."

Ni treatment significantly reduced the plant height, dry mass, and the contents of glutamate 1-semialdehyde, δ-amino levulinic acid, prototoporphyrin IX, Mg-prototoporphyrin IX, total chlorophyll, and carotenoids; however, the application of NO and Spd alleviated the decline considerably. Supplementation of NO and Spd mitigated the Ni-induced decline in photosynthesis, gas exchange, and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. Ni caused oxidative damage, while the application of NO, Spd, and NO+Spd significantly reduced the oxidative stress parameters under normal and Ni toxicity. The application of NO and Spd enhanced the function of the antioxidant system and upregulated the activity of glyoxalase enzymes, reflecting significant reduction of the oxidative effects and methylglyoxal accumulation. Tolerance against Ni was further strengthened by the accumulation of proline and glycine betaine due to NO and Spd application. The decrease in the uptake of essential mineral elements such as N, P, K, and Mg was alleviated by NO and Spd. Hence, individual and combined supplementation of NO and Spd effectively alleviates the damaging effects of Ni on tomato."

Accordingly, we aimed to determine the molecular mechanism of BcGRP23 and its role in chlorophyll metabolism and the BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1) signaling pathway in flowering Chinese cabbage. The expression levels of BcGRP23 in the leaves and stems gradually decreased with increasing growth and development of flowering Chinese cabbage, while BcGRP23 was barely expressed after flowering. As plant growth continued, the GUS (β-glucuronidase) stain gradually became lighter in hypocotyls and was largely free of growth points. The petioles and stems of BcGRP23-silenced plants lost their green color, and the contents of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and Chl b were significantly reduced. Further research revealed that the expression levels of chlorophyll degradation-related genes were significantly increased in silenced plants compared with the control; however, the opposite was noted for the BcGRP23-overexpressing lines. The BcGRP23 promoter sequence contains numerous hormone-responsive elements. In fact, the expression of BcGRP23 was upregulated in flowering Chinese cabbage following treatment with the hormones indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), gibberellin (GA), 6-benzylaminopurine (6-BA), methyl jasmonate (MeJA), and brassinosteroid (BR). Treatment with BR led to the most significant upregulation. BES1, in response to BRs, directly activated the BcGRP23 promoter. Overall, BcGRP23 regulated the expression of chlorophyll degradation-related genes, thereby affecting the chlorophyll content. Furthermore, the expression of BcGRP23 was significantly regulated by exogenous BR application and was directly activated by BES1. These findings preliminarily suggest the molecular mechanism and regulatory pathway of BcGRP23 in the growth and development of flowering Chinese cabbage plants and their response to environmental stress."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to screen different winter wheat genotypes at the onset of metabolic changes induced by water deficit to comprehend possible adaptive features of photosynthetic apparatus function and structure to physiological drought. The drought treatment was the most influential variable affecting plant growth and relative water content, and genotype variability determined with what intensity varieties of winter wheat seedlings responded to water deficit. PEG-induced drought, as expected, changed phenomenological energy fluxes and the efficiency with which an electron is transferred to final PSI acceptors. Based on the effect size, fluorescence parameters were grouped to represent photochemical parameters, that is, the donor and acceptor side of PSII (PC1); the thermal phase of the photosynthetic process, or the electron flow around PSI, and the chain of electrons between PSII and PSI (PC2); and phenomenological energy fluxes per cross-section (PC3). Furthermore, four distinct clusters of genotypes were discerned based on their response to imposed physiological drought, and integrated analysis enabled an explanation of their reactions' specificity. The most reliable JIP-test parameters for detecting and comparing the drought impact among tested genotypes were the variable fluorescence at K, L, I step, and PITOT. To conclude, developing and improving screening methods for identifying and evaluating functional relationships of relevant characteristics that are useful for acclimation, acclimatization, and adaptation to different types of drought stress can contribute to the progress in breeding research of winter wheat drought-tolerant lines."

      "abstract": "While salinity is increasingly becoming a prominent concern in arable farms around the globe, various treatments can be used for the mitigation of salt stress. Here, the effective presence of Azotobacter sp. inoculation (A1) and absence of inoculation (A0) was evaluated on Iranian licorice plants under NaCl stress (0 and 200 mM) (S0 and S1, respectively). In this regard, 16 Iranian licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra L.) accessions were evaluated for the effects on photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence. Leaf samples were measured for photosynthetic pigments (via a spectrophotometer), stomatal and trichome-related features (via SEM), along with several other morphological and biochemical features. The results revealed an increase in the amount of carotenoids that was caused by bacterial inoculation, which was 28.3% higher than the non-inoculated treatment. Maximum initial fluorescence intensity (F0) (86.7) was observed in the 'Bardsir' accession. Meanwhile, the highest variable fluorescence (Fv), maximal fluorescence intensity (Fm), and maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) (0.3, 0.4, and 0.8, respectively) were observed in the 'Eghlid' accession. Regarding anatomical observations of the leaf structure, salinity reduced stomatal density but increased trichome density. Under the effect of bacterial inoculation, salinity stress was mitigated. With the effect of bacterial inoculation under salinity stress, stomatal length and width increased, compared to the condition of no bacterial inoculation. Minimum malondialdehyde content was observed in 'Mahabad' accession (17.8 μmol/g FW). Principle component analysis (PCA) showed that 'Kashmar', 'Sepidan', 'Bajgah', 'Kermanshah', and 'Taft' accessions were categorized in the same group while being characterized by better performance in the aerial parts of plants. Taken together, the present results generally indicated that selecting the best genotypes, along with exogenous applications of Azotobacter, can improve the outcomes of licorice cultivation for industrial purposes under harsh environments."

      "abstract": "Light stress signalling in algae and plants is partially orchestrated by singlet oxygen (1O2), a reactive oxygen species (ROS) that causes significant damage within the chloroplast, such as lipid peroxidation. In the vicinity of the photosystem II reaction centre, a major source of 1O2, are two β-carotene molecules that quench 1O2 to ground-state oxygen. 1O2 can oxidise β-carotene to release β-cyclocitral, which has emerged as a 1O2-mediated stress signal in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We investigated if β-cyclocitral can have similar retrograde signalling properties in the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Using RNA-Seq, we show that genes up-regulated in response to exogenous β-cyclocitral included CAROTENOID CLEAVAGE DIOXYGENASE 8 (CCD8), while down-regulated genes included those associated with porphyrin and chlorophyll anabolism, such as tetrapyrrole-binding protein (GUN4), magnesium chelatases (CHLI1, CHLI2, CHLD, CHLH1), light-dependent protochlorophyllide reductase (POR1), copper target 1 protein (CTH1), and coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (CPX1). Down-regulation of this pathway has also been shown in β-cyclocitral-treated A. thaliana, indicating conservation of this signalling mechanism in plants. However, in contrast to A. thaliana, a very limited overlap in differential gene expression was found in β-cyclocitral-treated and 1O2-treated C. reinhardtii. Furthermore, exogenous treatment with β-cyclocitral did not induce tolerance to 1O2. We conclude that while β-cyclocitral may down-regulate chlorophyll synthesis, it does not seem to contribute to 1O2-mediated high light stress signalling in algae."

Appropriate EDTA treatment improved the photoactivity of ChlCu/ZnO and the adsorption selectivity to Cu2+. However, excessive EDTA treatment might lead to the collapse of the ChlCu structure, resulting in a decrease in photoactivity. The E-ChlCu/ZnO sample with 8 h of ChlCu treatment and 2 h of EDTA treatment showed optimal photoactivity. The as-prepared E-ChlCu/ZnO exhibited activity as a light-activated nanozyme, which could oxidize 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to blue under illumination, but when Cu2+ was present in the solution, this colorimetric reaction was inhibited; therefore, E-ChlCu/ZnO could be used for colorimetric detection of Cu2+. Because of the existence of specific cavities, E-ChlCu/ZnO showed excellent detection selectivity, a wide linear detection range (0-1 and 1-15 μM), and a low detection limit (0.024 μM) in the colorimetric detection of Cu2+."

      "abstract": "This paper is an extension of the work published in Journal of Fluorescence (2011) 21: 785-791. In the previous work, we studied the effect of dimethoate (50, 100 and 200 ppm) on growth and photosynthetic activity of wheat seedlings after 10 days of dimethoate treatment. In the present study, new measurement conditions (dimethoate concentration: 25 ppm, treatment period: 20 days and 30 days) were used in addition to those used in the past work. Various plant growth parameters, photosynthetic pigment content, laser-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (LICF) spectra and fluorescence induction kinetics (FIK) curves were recorded after 10, 20 and 30 days of dimethoate treatments. LICF spectra were recorded in the region of 650-780 nm using violet diode laser (405 nm). FIK curves were recorded at 685 nm using red diode laser (635 nm). Fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) of two fluorescence peaks around 685 and 730 nm, and variable chlorophyll fluorescence decrease ratio (Rfd) were determined from LICF spectra and FIK curves respectively. Curve-fitted parameters of LICF spectra were used for determination of FIR (F685/F730). The effect of treatment of the insecticide dimethoate on growth and photosynthetic activity of wheat seedlings was examined by using these parameters as well as the past work. In 10-days treatment, 25 and 50 ppm dimethoate showed stimulatory effect with better stimulation being observed at 25 ppm. All studied concentrations higher than 50 ppm exhibited inhibitory effect on wheat seedlings. In case of dimethoate treatment studied for longer durations (more than 10 days), all concentrations showed inhibitory effect. Lower doses which showed some positive response for short time duration become toxic with the extension of treatment periods. Thus, this study clearly confirms the toxic effect of dimethoate on wheat plants.",

      "abstract": "The escape of bladder cancer from immunosurveillance causes monotherapy to exhibit poor efficacy; therefore, designing a multifunctional nanoparticle that boosts programmed cell death and immunoactivation has potential as a treatment strategy. Herein, we developed a facile one-pot coprecipitation reaction to fabricate cluster-structured nanoparticles (CNPs) assembled from Fe3O4 and iron chlorophyll (Chl/Fe) photosensitizers. This nanoassembled CNP, as a multifunctional theranostic agent, could perform red-NIR fluorescence and change the redox balance by the photoinduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and attenuate iron-mediated lipid peroxidation by the induction of a Fenton-like reaction. The intravesical instillation of Fe3O4@Chl/Fe CNPs modified with 4-carboxyphenylboronic acid (CPBA) may target the BC wall through glycoproteins in the BC cavity, allowing local killing of cancer cells by photodynamic therapy (PDT)-induced singlet oxygen and causing chemodynamic therapy (CDT)-mediated ferroptosis. An interesting possibility is reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment from immunosuppressive to immunostimulatory after PDT-CDT treatment, which was demonstrated by the reduction of PD-L1 (lower \"off\" signal to the effector immune cells), IDO-1, TGF-β, and M2-like macrophages and the induction of CD8+ T cells on BC sections. Moreover, the intravesical instillation of Fe3O4@Chl/Fe CNPs may enhance the large-area distribution on the BC wall, improving antitumor efficacy and increasing survival rates from 0 to 91.7%. Our theranostic CNPs not only demonstrated combined PDT-CDT-induced cytotoxicity, ROS production, and ferroptosis to facilitate treatment efficacy but also opened up new horizons for eliminating the immunosuppressive effect by simultaneous PDT-CDT.",

In this study, a two-factor split-plot-design experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of two adjuvants on the efficacy of topramezone on the grassy weed species giant foxtail (Setaria faberi Herrm.) and the broadleaved weed species velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medik.) under three different temperature conditions. The two tested adjuvants were methylated seed oil (MSO) and organosilicone. Three temperature levels, 35/30°C, 25/20°C, and 15/10°C (day/night), were used in the laboratory and greenhouse experiment. Plant chlorophyll fluorescence measurements shortly after herbicide application and classic whole-plant bioassay methods were used to evaluate the herbicide efficacy among the different treatments. Results indicated that the maximum quantum efficiency (Fv/Fm) of the top leaf of the weeds treated with topramezone mixed with MSO was significantly lower than that of the weeds treated with topramezone mixed with organosilicone and without an adjuvant at 2-3 days after treatment under all three temperature levels. The herbicide response of the plants treated with topramezone mixed with organosilicone and topramezone alone was not significantly different. These results corresponded well with the results of the classic whole-plant test. MSO has been shown to be good at enhancing the efficacy of topramezone on these weed species under all three temperature conditions. The measurement of chlorophyll fluorescence is a promising technique for evaluating the effects of adjuvants on the efficacy of herbicides shortly after herbicide treatment."

      "abstract": "Downy mildew of foxtail millet is an important oomycete disease caused by Sclerospora graminicola, affecting the yield and quality of the crop. Foxtail millet infected with S. graminicola exhibit symptoms of leaf yellowing and leaf cracking. To uncover the pathogenic mechanism of this disease, we explored the effects on chlorophyll synthesis and photosynthesis of foxtail millet leaves infected by S. graminicola. An elite foxtail millet variety, JG21, susceptible to S. graminicola, was used as for this study. S. graminicola inhibited chlorophyll synthesis and caused loose mesophyll cell arrangement. In addition, some cells were severely vacuolated in S. graminicola-infected foxtail millet leaves at the early stages of infection. S. graminicola could invade the mesophyll cells through haustoria which destroyed the chloroplast structure at the middle stages of infection causing significant accumulation of osmiophilic particles (OPs) and disintegrated chloroplast grana lamellae. Furthermore, foxtail millet leaves split longitudinally at the later stages of infection. Chlorophyll and carotenoid contents in infected leaves decreased significantly compared with those in the control. Net photosynthetic rate (Pn) of leaves and stomatal conductance showed a downward trend, and intercellular carbon dioxide concentrations increased significantly following the infection with S. graminicola. A total of 1,618 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected between the control group and the treatment groups using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) among S1-S5 stages. DEGs associated with \"photosynthesis\" and \"light reaction\" were enriched. Gene expression patterns showed that 91.3% of 23 genes related to chlorophyll synthesis and photosynthesis, were significantly down-regulated than the control during S1-S5 stages. Based on the gene expression dataset, weighed gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) with 19 gene co-expression modules related to photosynthesis revealed six hub genes related to chlorophyll synthesis, which were suppressed during infection. The results suggest that infection of S. graminicola led to weak chlorophyll synthesis and rapid chloroplasts disappearance in foxtail millet. The defense responses and resistance of foxtail millet to S. graminicola were inhibited because chloroplast structure and function were destroyed in leaves, and the sexual reproduction in S. graminicola could be completed rapidly."

Herein, we present a synergistic antibacterial polylactic acid (PLA) surface with superhydrophobic antibacterial adhesion and photodynamic bactericidal activity. Initially, the surface displayed low-adhesion superhydrophobicity and resisted most bacterial adhesion. Furthermore, completely non-toxic chlorophyll possessed excellent photodynamic bactericidal properties under non-toxic visible light, which was incorporated into micro-/nanoscale PLA surfaces. We achieved efficient antibacterial activity using completely non-toxic materials and a facile non-solvent-induced phase separation process. This non-toxic, simple, good biocompatible, and no drug-resistant strategy has great advantages in combating bacterial infections.",
