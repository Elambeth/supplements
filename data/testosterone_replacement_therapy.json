      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Low testosterone levels and low vitamin D status are associated with increased cardiometabolic risk. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether vitamin D status determines the cardiometabolic effects of testosterone replacement therapy. Methods: The study population consisted of three groups of men with late-onset hypogonadism: vitamin D-naive individuals with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels between 20 and 30 ng/mL (group I), males with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels between 30 and 60 ng/mL receiving vitamin D supplementation because of previous low vitamin D status (group II), and vitamin D-naïve subjects with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels between 30 and 60 ng/mL (group III). Circulating levels of total testosterone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, glucose, insulin, lipids, uric acid, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), homocysteine, fibrinogen, and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) were assessed before and six months after intramuscular testosterone administration (250 mg every three weeks). Results: Group I differed from the remaining groups in baseline values of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, hsCRP, homocysteine, fibrinogen, UACR, and the Framingham Risk Score. In all three groups, testosterone injections increased plasma testosterone levels and had a neutral effect on 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration. In groups II and III, the drug improved insulin sensitivity and reduced LDL cholesterol, uric acid, hsCRP, homocysteine, fibrinogen, and UACR. In group I, the impact of testosterone was limited to a small decrease in HDL cholesterol and hsCRP. Only in groups II and III did testosterone reduce the Framingham Risk Score. There were no differences in the strength of testosterone action between both groups. In groups II and III, the replacement-induced changes in insulin sensitivity, LDL cholesterol, uric acid, hsCRP, homocysteine, fibrinogen, UACR, and the Framingham Risk Score positively correlated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration. Conclusions: The study results suggest that the cardiometabolic effects of exogenous testosterone in men with testosterone deficiency may be determined by vitamin D status.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Heart failure (HF), a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, is characterized by a complex pathophysiology involving neurohormonal activation, metabolic dysregulation, and multiple hormonal deficiency syndrome (MHDS). MHDS is common in HF, affecting up to 90% of patients, and is associated with worse outcomes. This systematic review aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in the management of HF. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining TRT in HF patients up to September 15, 2024. Studies were included if they involved human subjects aged 18 or older with a confirmed diagnosis of HF and had a follow-up period of at least 4 weeks. We excluded reviews, animal studies, observational studies, and trials without randomization. RESULTS: Our search yielded 653 records, of which 12 studies met the inclusion criteria. Key findings include significant improvements in muscle strength and aerobic capacity as well as increases in lean muscle mass and decreases in fat mass in certain trials. Additionally, improvements in insulin sensitivity and shortening of the QT interval were reported. TRT did not consistently affect blood pressure, lipid profiles, or heart rate, nor did it lead to any serious adverse effects. DISCUSSION: While TRT has demonstrated potential benefits in HF patients, particularly in improving physical function and metabolic profiles, the current evidence is limited by small sample sizes and short follow-up periods. Larger event-driven RCTs evaluating hard endpoints are needed to determine whether TRT should be integrated into standard HF therapies."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) has become increasingly common, particularly for patients with symptomatic hypogonadism or individuals undergoing gender-affirming therapy. The current literature is inconclusive on the association between TRT and orthopedic surgery. This study sought to examine outcomes of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) in patients receiving TRT. Methods: A retrospective cohort of RSA patients from 2010 to 2022 was queried using the PearlDiver database. Patients were included if they underwent RSA with at least 2 years of follow-up. Patients who underwent at least 90 days of TRT prior to their surgery were matched by Charlson Comorbidity Index, age, and gender to a control cohort. Univariate analysis using chi-squared tests and Student's t-tests were used to compare demographics outcomes between groups. Results: A total of 1906 patients were identified who used TRT within 90 days of undergoing RSA, and these patients were matched to a control cohort of 1906 patients. Patients who used TRT within 90 days did not have significantly different rates of revision RSA (12.01%) compared to those without use (11.02%) (p = 0.335). Furthermore, between the TRT group and the control group, PJI rates (1.42% vs. 1.63%; p = 0.597) and periprosthetic fracture rates (0.58% vs. 1.05%, p = 0.105) were not significantly different. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that TRT use within 90 days of RSA does not increase the rates of revision, fracture, or infection. These results can assist surgeons when evaluating patients on TRT who also may be candidates for RSA."

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Hypogonadism is defined by consistently low serum testosterone levels in conjunction with clinical symptoms. Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) can be used to achieve physiologic levels of testosterone. Testosterone deficiency is associated with increased mortality and poorer health outcomes. PURPOSE: To compare rates of mortality, atrial fibrillation (AF), stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and prostate cancer in hypogonadal men who received TRT versus those who did not. METHODS: The TriNetX database was utilized to access deidentified, retrospective propensity matched EMR data from 57 participating health care organizations between 2005 to 2020. Cohorts included males 40 to 80 years old diagnosed with hypogonadism who were prescribed TRT versus no TRT. Propensity matching was performed to reduce bias and balance confounding factors between the 2 groups. The following 3-year outcomes were analyzed: mortality, AF, stroke, MI, and prostate cancer. RESULTS: There were 163,456 male patients identified with hypogonadism, and 133,584 were included after propensity matching. There was a lower mortality rate, (3.1% vs 3.6%; RR, 0.886; P < .001), decreased risk of AF (3.6% vs 4.0%; RR 0.900; P < .001), less stroke (1.6% vs 1.8%; RR, 0.898; P < .011), and fewer cases of prostate cancer (1.9% vs 2.9%; RR 0.648; P < .001) for patients on TRT. CONCLUSIONS: Using TRT is associated with moderately lower rates of mortality, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and prostate cancer in hypogonadal men versus no TRT. There is potential for missed cases of stroke, prostate cancer, and cardiovascular disease incidence not captured by the database. As prescriptions of TRT increase, understanding risks and benefits will help guide future practice.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Men with Klinefelter syndrome (KS) have hypogonadism, increased morbidity, and excess mortality. Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) has the potential to alleviate this burden. We assessed the risk of major cardiovascular events (MACE) and mortality in KS according to TRT exposure. METHODS: We performed a nationwide registry based matched cohort study. We compared incidences of MACE and mortality between TRT exposed (KS-TRT) or unexposed KS (KS-non-TRT), and a male background population comparison cohort. The study period was from 1 January 1994 to 31 December 2022. FINDINGS: We identified 557 KS-TRT, and matched these with unexposed men with KS born the same year (total KS n = 950). We similarly identified a comparison cohort of 50,150 men from the background population matched on month and year of birth. Median age at entry for KS-TRT was 31.1 years (interquartile range; 19.9-40.0) and median follow-up time was 12.9 years (interquartile range; 7.5-20.7). KS-TRT was associated with lower all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio (95% CI); 0.56 (0.37-0.85)), with mortality in KS-TRT comparable to the comparison cohort (hazard ratio (95% CI); 1.27 (0.91-1.79)). Incidence of MACE was comparable between KS-TRT and KS-non-TRT. INTERPRETATION: TRT could alleviate excess mortality in KS and appears safe regarding cardiovascular risk. Today, most men with KS go undiagnosed, missing proper medical attention. There is a dire need for a policy change to ensure timely diagnosis and treatment in all men with KS. FUNDING: The A.P.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) is pivotal in addressing male hypogonadism, yet uncertainties persist regarding its optimal use and long-term ramifications. This study aims to explore the knowledge map of TRT. METHODS: In this bibliometric study, we searched Scopus for relevant keywords from the beginning to 2023. Our inclusion criteria were original articles and reviews and our exclusion criteria were non-English and non-related articles and document types other than original articles and reviews. Excel, VOS viewer, and Science of Science (Sci2) software were used for data synthesis. RESULTS: From 6712 retrieved articles, 5325 articles were included for analysis. The most productivity belonged to the USA (n=2,570 documents), the United Kingdom (n=476), and Italy (n=339). \"Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism\" (n=168) had the highest participation in publishing. Also, \"Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism\" and the \"Journal of Sexual Medicine\" exhibited significant bibliographic coupling with other journals in the TRT field. The research topics of interest were mainly related to hypogonadism, prostate cancer, and erectile dysfunction. Bursting analysis of the title and abstract revealed the TRT research prior to the year 2000 was mainly focused on castration, gonadectomy, growth, and aplastic anemia, while the focus of recent research moved towards libido, cardiovascular events, HIV, geriatric issues, diabetes, bipolar disorder, cancer, transmasculine, and transgender individuals. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the growing trend of TRT research over time, with most focus on hypogonadism, prostate cancer, and erectile dysfunction. Insights gleaned from this analysis inform research priorities and resource allocation, facilitating enhanced patient care in androgen deficiency management."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Whether circulating testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol levels or testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) affects the risk of COVID-19 and whether COVID-19 affects response to TRT remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: The study evaluated whether baseline testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol levels or TRT are associated with risk of developing COVID-19 and whether COVID-19 affects treatment response to TRT. METHODS: Among 5204 men, aged 45 to 80 years, with hypogonadism in the TRAVERSE trial, 379 developed COVID-19. We compared baseline and on-treatment hormone levels, and safety and efficacy in participants with and without COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: Neither baseline nor on-treatment testosterone, estradiol, and dihydrotestosterone levels prior to COVID-19 differed significantly between men with and without COVID-19 diagnosis. Incidence of COVID-19 was similar in participants randomized to TRT or placebo groups (3-year Kaplan-Meier incidence 8.0% in TRT and 8.6% in placebo group, P = .823). Incidences of COVID-19-related hospitalizations (38.5% vs 32.8%, P = .222) and deaths (12.8% vs 8.9%, P = .247) were similar in the TRT and placebo groups. Changes in hypogonadal symptoms, libido, energy, and hemoglobin/hematocrit in response to TRT were attenuated in testosterone-treated men who developed COVID-19. Incidences of major adverse cardiovascular events, venous thromboembolism, and acute kidney injury were similar in those with COVID-19 diagnosis and those without. CONCLUSION: In men with hypogonadism and cardiovascular disease (CVD) or increased risk of CVD, baseline and pre-COVID-19 on-treatment testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol levels were similar in those who developed COVID-19 and those who did not. TRT did not affect the risk of COVID-19. COVID-19 attenuated the treatment response to TRT."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This narrative review aims to provide the most updated knowledge regarding the treatment of adverse effects secondary to testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), such as gynecomastia, cardiovascular and hematologic risks, prostate health risk, and liver dysfunction risks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An extensive literature review was conducted, incorporating guidelines from the American Urological Association and the Endocrine Society. The studies determined common adverse effects and their most common methods of management. RESULTS: TRT improves the quality of life, sexual function, and mood in hypogonadal men. Possible adverse effects associated with TRT include increased estrogen levels and gynecomastia, which are usually managed with aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen. Cardiovascular risks from TRT include hypertension and erythrocytosis, which mandate periodic hematocrit and blood pressure monitoring; therapeutic phlebotomy is indicated if the hematocrit exceeds 52%. No significant concern regarding prostate cancer has been observed in the closely monitored patient. However, TRT should not be administered to individuals with active evidence of untreated prostate cancer, except under rare circumstances such as active surveillance for very low-risk disease. Older oral forms of TRT can affect liver function; therefore, transdermal, newer oral forms and injectables are generally favored in men with a history of liver disease. CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring and management of adverse effects are critical to maximize benefit and minimize the risks of TRT. Ongoing research will further elucidate the safety of TRT while advancing evidence-based practices in managing its associated adverse effects. Effective patient education and counseling are also essential to improve compliance and treatment outcomes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While the use of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in men undergoing active surveillance (AS) for prostate cancer (PCa) has been historically contraindicated, recent studies have contributed to a paradigm shift to this approach. AIM: To examine the impact of testosterone on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and prostate biopsy progression in men with low testosterone on AS for PCa. METHODS: A retrospective single-center analysis was conducted on men undergoing AS for PCa who subsequently underwent TRT. Men previously treated for PCa were excluded. PSA and testosterone levels were recorded at regular intervals one year before and after the initiation of testosterone. ANOVA was used to analyze variance in PSA and testosterone levels, and paired t-tests and linear regression analysis were performed. Baseline and surveillance biopsies were documented. OUTCOMES: The primary outcomes were changes in PSA levels and biopsy progression following initiation of testosterone therapy. RESULTS: Forty-three men met the inclusion criteria. Median (IQR) testosterone level before testosterone therapy was 272 (221.5-333.5) ng/dL and 578.5 (354.5-846.5) ng/dL after therapy (P < 0.01). No significant variation in mean PSA levels was observed (P = 0.87). Baseline biopsies were available for 27 patients, showing Gleason 3 + 3 = 6 in no more than three cores. Fifteen (55.6%) patients had one or more surveillance biopsies after starting testosterone therapy. Of these, 12 (80.0%) had no disease progression in biopsies over a mean of 44.3 months on testosterone. Three patients (20.0%) had a Gleason score 7 on biopsy after a mean of 79.5 months on testosterone therapy. No patients developed metastatic disease. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Testosterone therapy did not result in statistically significant changes in PSA levels in men with low testosterone on AS. Pathology changes were inconclusive, but the available data showed no apparent increase in PCa progression or disease worsening in the cohort. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: The study's strengths include a longitudinal follow-up design and use of multiple statistical analyses. Limitations include the retrospective design, small sample size which may limit generalizability, and lack of control group. CONCLUSION: No significant change in PSA level was observed after initiating testosterone therapy, despite an increase in testosterone levels. Despite limited biopsy data, our findings suggest similar rates of disease progression compared to the general AS population.",

This study surveyed TRT donor testosterone levels in whole blood components and evaluated a possible mitigation strategy with a pathogen reduction technology using UVA light and compound adsorption device (CAD) steps. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Whole blood from male TRT donors and controls were processed into red blood cells and plasma components. Free and total testosterone were measured in 78 TRT donors and 48 controls by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Pathogen reduction (INTERCEPT Blood System) on pooled plasma components (n = 10) with supraphysiologic testosterone were sampled: before treatment, after UVA illumination, and after CAD incubation. RESULTS: TRT donors had 3.8 and 3.9 times more free testosterone in plasma and red blood cell supernatant, respectively, and 2.3 times more total testosterone in both components than controls (p < .0001). Two controls and 33 TRT donors had supraphysiologic testosterone. The CAD incubation reduced the mean free and total testosterone by 88% (571.72-73.8 pg/mL) and 84% (1498.61-240.59 ng/mL), respectively (p = .0065), but UVA light had no effect (p > .9999). DISCUSSION: TRT donors had significantly higher testosterone levels than controls. The CAD step in the pathogen reduction process abrogated supraphysiologic testosterone in plasma at or below the reference range. Studies validating testosterone removal from plasma can support the transfusion of pathogen-reduced plasma and platelets from TRT donors.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Whether testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) can mitigate the risk of vertebral fractures has not been well-studied. METHODS: PearlDiver was queried to identify patients with and without the history of TRT. Groups were matched 1:1 by demographic variables and 2-year vertebral fracture incidence rate was compared. Multivariate logistic regression was done to identify independent predictors of vertebral fractures. RESULTS: Among 77,491 matched patients, mean age was 54.7 ± 10.4 years, 74.3% were males, and mean Charlson Comorbidity Index was 0.17 ± 0.54. Testosterone replacement therapy patients had higher rates of vertebral fractures (0.31% vs 0.04%, P < 0.001), and these rates were observed to increase with age. Both men alone (0.36% vs 0.04%, P < 0.001) and women alone (0.16% vs 0.03%, P < 0.001) on TRT had higher rates of vertebral fractures. Multivariate analysis revealed that TRT (OR = 7.7, 95%CI = 5.1-11.7, P < 0.001), as well as chronic kidney disease (OR = 1.4, 95%CI = 1.1-2.0, P = 0.026), alcohol abuse (OR = 2.5, 95%CI = 1.8-3.5, P < 0.001), and diphosphonate use (OR = 2.2, 95%CI = 1.4-3.5, P < 0.001), increased vertebral fracture rates. CONCLUSIONS: Exogenous testosterone use was associated with increased 2-year incidence of vertebral fractures. Although a causal relationship could not be established, our findings highlight the need to use screening measures, such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan, to identify patients at risk of vertebral fractures.",

      "abstract": "The case report explores the effects of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) on body composition, lean muscle mass, and fat mass, based on the dosage of TRT and exercise intensity in a 40-year-old male. The purpose of this case study was to evaluate the dose-response relationship of TRT and exercise on muscle hypertrophy and fat loss over an eight-month period, using a validated wrist-worn wearable fitness tracker to measure daily physical activity and heart rate (HR)-based exercise intensity. The patient, a trained male with 25 years of consistent exercise experience, reported notable declines in strength and increases in body fat despite maintaining a regular workout routine. TRT was prescribed by a physician and self-administered by the patient three times per week, starting at 150 mg per week for the first three weeks and then increasing to 180 mg per week at week four. Daily step counts and strength and aerobic exercise data were tracked utilizing a wrist-worn device (Polar Ignite 2) and an HR chest strap (Polar H10) to monitor time accumulated in five different HR zones (HR Zone 1-5). The study was divided into three phases: pre-TRT (two months of no TRT, just exercise), Phase 1 TRT (three months of TRT and exercise), and Phase 2 TRT (three months of TRT and exercise). Lastly, body composition and basal metabolic rate were assessed via bioelectrical impedance analysis at baseline and throughout the TRT period. Results indicated a substantial increase in lean muscle mass and a reduction in body fat during the TRT phases. Lean muscle mass increased by 6% during Phase 1 TRT and continued to rise by 3.8% in Phase 2 TRT, while body fat percentage decreased by 1.7% and 1.3% in TRT Phase 1 and TRT Phase 2, respectively. The participant's basal metabolic rate also improved, with a 4.5% increase during Phase 1 TRT and a further 3.2% rise in Phase 2 TRT. The time spent in HR Zones 1-5 significantly (P ≤ 0.007) shifted throughout the study. While time in moderate-to-high-intensity zones (HR Zones 3-5) increased in Phase 1, a trend toward more time accumulated in lower-intensity exercise (HR Zones 1-2) emerged in Phase 2, suggesting a potential adaptation in cardiovascular efficiency. Despite these shifts, overall exercise duration and average and maximal HR responses remained stable across the phases, indicating consistent cardiovascular demand. Combining TRT with regular aerobic and strength exercise greater than 60 minutes, at least four to five times per week, enhances lean muscle mass and reduces body fat, while the exercise intensity varies from phase to phase. The increase in lean mass was dose-dependent, with larger gains observed early in the TRT supplementation period compared to no TRT. Additionally, the use of wearable technology provided valuable insights into the participant's HR responses to training. These findings highlight the exercise approaches and HR responses potentially required for significant body recomposition and improved metabolic health with TRT. Further research with larger samples is needed to confirm these results and explore long-term health outcomes."

      "abstract": "The relation between testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) and anterior cruciate ligament injury risk has garnered attention in recent orthopaedic research. With TRT's popularity on the rise, understanding its potential musculoskeletal risks is important for orthopaedic and sports medicine providers. Whereas some studies suggest an association, confounding variables such as activity level, number of hours of sports participation, dosing variations, physiological versus supraphysiological levels of testosterone, and individual patient characteristics may influence outcomes. In addition, the etiology may not be biological because patients undergoing TRT may experience increased motivation and energy levels, leading them to engage in higher-risk activities. Our research shows that supraphysiological testosterone supplementation (for short periods) increases lean body mass postoperatively, suggesting a potential benefit in recovery after anterior cruciate ligament surgery. Clinicians should remain vigilant, ensuring that TRT is prescribed judiciously, with a thorough assessment of each patient's unique risk profile."

This study aims to determine the direct impact of testosterone therapy on the components of MS; although excluding type 2 diabetes cases. The authors conducted a systematic literature search of PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases without date limits, using keywords such as \"testosterone therapy\", \"metabolic syndrome\" and \"men\". The studies included in our review focused on the effects of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in male patients with MS, yet rejecting individuals where type 2 diabetes constituted the only diagnosis. A meta-analysis was performed using PQStat v1.8.6 software. The overall effect size (mean difference) was calculated using a random effects model. Our meta-analysis indicates that testosterone therapy leads to improvement in the components of MS. Significant reductions were observed in waist circumference (WC) (95% CI: -0.709 to 0.094; p = 0.011), as well as in triglycerides (TG) (95% CI: -0.474 to 0.120; p = 0.039). These findings support the potential therapeutic benefits of testosterone treatment in managing MS. However, further research is vital to explore the long-term effects and the safety of this therapy in patients with metabolic syndrome.",

We hypothesized that testosterone treatment (TT) modulates progression of MASLD and performed a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy of TT on liver steatosis and fibrosis. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase from inception until November 2023. We screened 1,489 studies and identified 9 eligible studies. We assessed risk of bias for randomized trials using RoB-2 \"Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials,\" nonrandomized studies using ROBINS-I tool \"Risk of Bias In Nonrandomized Studies-of Interventions,\" and Murad's tool for single-arm studies. We pooled estimates using RevMan 5. RESULTS: Three randomized controlled trials|, 4 nonrandomized studies, and 2 single-arm studies were identified. The population of interest comprised men with MASLD. TT was administered at varying doses, routes, and frequencies, with follow-up ranging from 12 weeks to 8 years. Liver fibrosis and steatosis were assessed using liver biopsy in 3 studies, CT/MRI in 5, and serum scores in 2. All studies provided evidence of reduction in liver steatosis with TT compared with no TT. In addition, the LiFT (randomized controlled trials) trial demonstrated a resolution of MASLD/ metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis and a regression in liver fibrosis. TT led to decrease in liver enzymes. Studies were heterogenous in terms of population characteristics, treatment modalities, endpoints, and follow-up. Adverse events were comparable between the 2 groups. DISCUSSION: TT is a promising treatment option for men with MASLD and low testosterone. It may improve liver steatosis and reduce liver fibrosis. Large, double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled trials are needed.",

AIM: To validate the secondary findings of the TRAVERSE trial. METHODS: We utilized the TriNetX Research Network to identify a cohort of men ages 45-80 years old who met similar inclusion criteria to the TRAVERSE trial. We compared hypogonadal men (testosterone 100-300 ng/dL) who had a prescription for topical testosterone therapy and men who did not. Propensity score matching was used to match patient populations. Kaplan Meier survival analysis was used to determine the relative risk of new-onset AF and AKI within 3 years. OUTCOMES: New-onset AF and AKI within 3 years. RESULTS: There were 2134 men included in each cohort after propensity score matching. Men on TRT had significantly lower testosterone (T) at the time of diagnosis compared to men not prescribed TRT (207 ± 66 ng/dL vs 246 ± 140 ng/dL, P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a significantly increased risk of AKI among men on TRT (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.07-2.18). However, TRT was not associated with a significantly increased risk of new-onset AF (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.93-2.37). CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Hypogonadal men with underlying cardiovascular risk factors or pre-existing cardiovascular disease who receive TRT may be at increased risk of AKI after starting therapy. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: We evaluated a large global research database and utilized similar inclusion and exclusion to the TRAVERSE trial. However, our results are limited by the retrospective study design and reliance on documented claims data. CONCLUSION: Similar to the TRAVERSE trial, our study demonstrated an increased risk of AKI among men on TRT, but did not find increased risk of AF. However, further studies are required to validate these results.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of 186 patients (88 in the TRT group; 98 in the control group) were collected. The patients in the TRT group received intramuscular administration of testosterone enanthate (250 mg) every 4 weeks for 12 months. The patients' background information such as current medical history and lifestyle habits were collected. Waist circumference, body mass index, and body fat volume were measured at baseline and 12-month visit. Fasting blood sugar (FBS), hemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were collected at baseline and 12-month visit. The FIB-4 index was calculated according to age, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, and platelet count. RESULTS: Except for serum FBS values, most of baseline characteristics were comparable between the TRT and control groups. When comparing the changes of each variable from baseline at 12-month visit in both groups, significant differences were found in waist circumference (p=0.00248), fat volume (p=0.00812), and platelet counts (p=0.0478), whereas a FIB-4 index did not change. On the contrary, in a subanalysis including only patients with a FIB-4 index ≥1.30 at baseline, a significant difference in a FIB-4 index (-0.10±0.39 vs. 0.04±0.44; p=0.0311) was observed with significant decreases in waist circumference, body fat volume, and TG levels, and an increase in platelet counts. The FIB-4 index was significantly decreased by TRT from 1.98±0.52 to 1.87±0.60 (p=0.0277). CONCLUSIONS: TRT for 12 months improved the FIB-4 index among hypogonadal men with a higher baseline FIB-4 index."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Low levels of testosterone cause male hypogonadism, which is associated with sexual dysfunction, tiredness and reduced muscle strength and quality of life. Testosterone replacement therapy is commonly used for ameliorating symptoms of male hypogonadism, but there is uncertainty about the magnitude of its effects and its cardiovascular and cerebrovascular safety. AIMS OF THE RESEARCH: The primary aim was to evaluate the safety of testosterone replacement therapy. We also assessed the clinical and cost-effectiveness of testosterone replacement therapy for men with male hypogonadism, and the existing qualitative evidence on men's experience and acceptability of testosterone replacement therapy. DESIGN: Evidence synthesis and individual participant data meta-analysis of effectiveness and safety, qualitative evidence synthesis and model-based cost-utility analysis. DATA SOURCES: Major electronic databases were searched from 1992 to February 2021 and were restricted to English-language publications. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis of individual participant data according to current methodological standards. Evidence was considered from placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of any formulation of testosterone replacement therapy in men with male hypogonadism. Primary outcomes were mortality and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Data were extracted by one reviewer and cross-checked by a second reviewer. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. We performed one-stage meta-analyses using the acquired individual participant data and two-stage meta-analyses to integrate the individual participant data with data extracted from eligible studies that did not provide individual participant data. A decision-analytic Markov model was developed to evaluate the cost per quality-adjusted life-years of the use of testosterone replacement therapy in cohorts of patients of different starting ages. RESULTS: We identified 35 trials (5601 randomised participants). Of these, 17 trials (3431 participants) provided individual participant data. There were too few deaths to assess mortality. There was no difference between the testosterone replacement therapy group (120/1601, 7.5%) and placebo group (110/1519, 7.2%) in the incidence of cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular events (13 studies, odds ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 1.42; p = 0.62). Testosterone replacement therapy improved quality of life and sexual function in almost all patient subgroups. In the testosterone replacement therapy group, serum testosterone was higher while serum cholesterol, triglycerides, haemoglobin and haematocrit were all lower. We identified several themes from five qualitative studies showing how symptoms of low testosterone affect men's lives and their experience of treatment. The cost-effectiveness of testosterone replacement therapy was dependent on whether uncertain effects on all-cause mortality were included in the model, and on the approach used to estimate the health state utility increment associated with testosterone replacement therapy, which might have been driven by improvements in symptoms such as sexual dysfunction and low mood. LIMITATIONS: A meaningful evaluation of mortality was hampered by the limited number of defined events. Definition and reporting of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and methods for testosterone measurement varied across trials. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support a relationship between testosterone replacement therapy and cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events in the short-to-medium term. Testosterone replacement therapy improves sexual function and quality of life without adverse effects on blood pressure, serum lipids or glycaemic markers. FUTURE WORK: Rigorous long-term evidence assessing the safety of testosterone replacement therapy and subgroups most benefiting from treatment is needed.

Methods: 3 databases were searched for studies up to June 2023 per the PRISMA guidelines. The eligibility criteria comprised RCTs and observational studies involving hypogonadal males receiving exogenous testosterone, in which CIMT was assessed. CAA was the primary outcome, whereas secondary outcomes included HDL, LDL, CRP, total cholesterol and total testosterone. The statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager. Results: Statistical analysis revealed no association between TRT and assessed outcomes. There was a significant increase in total testosterone levels, depicting indirect anti-atherosclerotic effects of TRT. Conclusion: Meta-analysis shows no relation between TRT and CIMT or other markers, allowing its safe usage for hypogonadal males."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Statins and testosterone replacement therapy (TTh) have been inconsistently associated with a reduced risk of hormone-related cancers (HRCs, prostate [PCa], colorectal [CRC], and male breast cancers [BrCa]). Yet, the joint association of statins and TTh with the incidence of these cancers, and whether these associations vary by race, remains poorly understood. The objective of this retrospective cohort study is to examine the independent and joint effects of pre-diagnostic use of statins and TTh on the risk of HRCs, including PCa, CRC, and male BrCa. MATERIALS: and Methods: In 105,690 men (≥65 yrs) identified using the SEER-Medicare 2007-2015 data, we identified 82,578 White and 10,256 Black men. Pre-diagnostic prescription of statins and TTh was ascertained for this analysis and categorized into four groups (Neither users, statins alone, TTh alone and Dual users). Multivariable Time-varying Cox proportional hazards and Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) models were performed. RESULTS: We found inverse joint associations of statins and TTh with incident HRCs before (aHR: 0.39; 95 % CI: 0.35-0.44) and after 3 years of follow-up (aHR: 0.74; 95 % CI: 0.67-0.82). This included a lower risk for advanced stage HRC (only <3 years follow-up). Similar joint associations were identified with incident PCa, aggressive PCa, incident CRC, and its specific right- and left-sided CRC (only <3 years follow-up). In general, the inverse associations persisted among White (mainly <3 years follow-up) and Black men (high-grade HRC and <3 years follow-up). Findings from the AFT analysis were similar. DISCUSSION: Pre-diagnostic use of statins and TTh were, independently and jointly, associated with reduced risks of HRC and specific cancer sites at three years of follow-up overall, and among White and Black men. Greatest associations of HRCs risk reduction were observed among dual users (statins plus TTh). Further studies are needed to validate these findings, including larger samples of Black men, and male BrCa sites.",

      "abstract": "The incidence of low serum testosterone has been increasing in men of all ages across a period which also corresponds to an increasing prevalence of kidney stones. Currently, the relationship between testosterone and kidney stones is unclear. Using the TriNetX Research Network, we performed a retrospective cohort study to evaluate the risk of developing an initial kidney stone in men based on their total testosterone level. Men aged ≥18 were divided into a low testosterone (<300 ng/dL) and normal testosterone (≥ 300 ng/dL) cohort. Men were excluded if they had a history of a kidney stone encounter diagnosis before testosterone measurement and a history of testosterone therapy prescription at any point. Propensity score matching was employed with an absolute standardized mean difference of less than 0.1 used as an indicator of successful matching. Our main outcome of interest was risk of developing an initial kidney stone in men aged ≥18 and within age-based subgroups. In men 18 and older, low testosterone was associated with a higher risk of one or more kidney stone encounter diagnoses (HR 1.12, 95% CI [1.09-1.15]). When stratified by age, no significant association between low testosterone and kidney stone encounter diagnoses was seen in men aged 18-24 (HR 1.09, 95% CI [0.85-1.39]). The highest risk was observed in men with low testosterone aged 34-44 (HR 1.29, 95% CI [1.17-1.38]). In this study, low serum testosterone was associated with an increased risk of initial kidney stone diagnosis in adult men without testosterone therapy prescriptions at any point in their life. Stratifying by age, the increased risk appears to begin in men aged 25, with the highest observed risk in men aged 33-44."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Testosterone, estradiol, and dihydrotestosterone share common ligand binding sites on sex hormone binding globulin and albumin. It is unknown whether and how changes in testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol concentrations during testosterone replacement therapy affect free testosterone fraction. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of changes in testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol concentrations on free testosterone fraction during testosterone replacement therapy of men with hypogonadism. METHODS: Using data from the Testosterone Trials, we assessed the association of changes in total testosterone, estradiol, and dihydrotestosterone concentrations over 12 months of testosterone replacement therapy with changes in free testosterone fraction, measured using equilibrium dialysis. We used random forests to evaluate the associations of predicted mean changes in free testosterone fraction with changes in circulating concentrations of each hormone at low, mean, or high change in the other two hormones. RESULTS: Testosterone replacement therapy not only increased total testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, estradiol, and free testosterone concentrations, but also the percent free testosterone, even though sex hormone binding globulin levels did not change. The predicted changes in free testosterone fraction during testosterone replacement therapy exhibited a non-linear relationship with changes in each of total testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol concentrations. Greater increases in testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol levels during testosterone replacement therapy were each associated with higher model-predicted percent free testosterone. Substantially smaller changes in molar concentrations of estradiol and dihydrotestosterone had a greater effect on percent free testosterone than those in testosterone. CONCLUSION: During testosterone replacement therapy of men with hypogonadism, changes in testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol concentrations each altered percent free testosterone non-linearly. Small changes in estradiol concentrations exerted much larger effect on the free testosterone fraction than testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, suggesting complex interactions of the three hormones with the binding proteins. Assessment of changes in free testosterone during testosterone replacement therapy should include consideration of changes in all three hormones.",

However, it is generally avoided in patients with a history of prostate cancer or breast cancer as there is uncertainty about risks. This case illustrates an example of synchronous metastatic prostate cancer and male breast cancer following TRT. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 72-year-old man with previously treated intermediate-risk prostate adenocarcinoma experienced a gradual rise in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) while self-administering testosterone replacement. He was later found to have recurrent metastatic prostate cancer and prior to initiating androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), he was also diagnosed with male breast cancer. His treatment has consisted of continued ADT for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) as well as surgical resection of his breast cancer. DISCUSSION: ADT plays a role in treatment of male breast cancer and prostate cancer. TRT remains relatively contraindicated in patients with a history of these malignancies, but the evidence supporting this recommendation is somewhat limited. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the potential risk for synchronous recurrent prostate and new male breast cancer following TRT. Further studies are needed to better elucidate the increased risks of these malignancies with TRT."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to perform a network meta-analysis (NMA) to investigate the effects of different testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) administration routes on lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in aging men with late-onset hypogonadism (LOH). METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, CNKI, WanFang Data, and VIP was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting data on International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, or prostate volume. NMA was performed, and subgroup analysis was conducted to assess the impact of TRT duration on outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 21 RCTs involving 2453 participants were included. For pairwise meta-analysis, p values for TRT delivered by transdermal, intramuscular, and oral routes were as follows: IPSS: 0.93, 0.20, and 0.76; PSA level: 0.20, 0.27, and 0.98; prostate volume: 0.18, 0.04, and 0.16. There were no significant differences in IPSS, PSA level, or prostate volume between TRT routes. In subgroup analysis, long-term intramuscular TRT significantly decreased IPSS (p = 0.03), short-term transdermal TRT increased PSA levels (p < 0.001), and short-term intramuscular TRT increased the prostate volume (p = 0.04). Other forms of TRT showed no significant change in IPSS, PSA level, and prostate volume compared with the placebo. Indirect comparison of the three administration routes demonstrated no significant differences in IPSS, PSA level, and prostate volume. Nevertheless, surface under the cumulative ranking curve analysis indicated that intramuscular TRT had an 83% probability of being the best method for decreasing IPSS. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that TRT does not worsen LUTS regardless of the administration route. Intramuscular TRT may be the preferred treatment for aging men with LOH and LUTS. Intramuscular TRT may be the preferred treatment for men with LOH and LUTS. Further research is warranted to validate these findings and optimize TRT management strategies.",

As a part of that effort, red blood cells collected from therapeutic phlebotomy of donors on testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) have been conditionally approved for transfusion. However, platelets from TRT donors are not currently approved for use due to limited data on effects of supraphysiologic testosterone on recipient safety and platelet function. The objective of this study was to provide a comprehensive profile of phenotype and function in platelets from TRT and control donors. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Platelets in plasma were collected from TRT and control donors (N = 10 per group; age- and sex-matched) and stored at room temperature for 7 days. On storage Day 1 (D1) and Day 7 (D7), platelet products were analyzed for platelet count, metabolic parameters (i.e., glucose, lactate, mitochondrial function), surface receptor expression, aggregation, thrombin generation, and thrombus formation under physiological flow conditions. RESULTS: TRT donor platelets were not significantly different than control donor platelets in terms of count, surface phenotype, metabolic function, ability to aggregate, thrombin generation, or ability to form occlusive thrombus under arterial flow regimes. Both groups were similar to each other by D7, but had significantly lost hemostatic function compared to D1. DISCUSSION: Platelets derived from donors undergoing TRT have similar phenotypic and functional profiles compared to those derived from control donors. This suggests that therapeutic phlebotomy of TRT donors may provide a useful source for platelet products.",

Studies suggest that testosterone replacement therapy may improve sexual function, depressive symptoms, bone density, and lean body mass.

Although prior studies suggested that testosterone replacement therapy increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, a large, randomized trial showed that it does not increase the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke, even in patients at high risk. After a detailed discussion of the potential benefits and risks through shared decision-making, testosterone replacement therapy should be considered for men with testosterone deficiency to correct selected symptoms and induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics. Treatment method should take into consideration patient preference, pharmacokinetics, potential for medication interactions, formulation-specific adverse effects, treatment burden, and cost. Clinicians should monitor men receiving testosterone replacement therapy for symptom improvement, potential adverse effects, and adherence. Serum testosterone, hematocrit, and prostate-specific antigen levels should be measured at baseline and at least annually in men 40 years or older receiving testosterone replacement therapy.

These same patients also experience a high degree of cachexia, a loss of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. OBJECTIVE: To perform a contemporary review of the literature to assess the effectiveness of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) for managing chronic disease-associated cachexia. METHODS: We performed a PubMed literature search using MeSH terms to identify studies from 2000 to 2022 on TRT and the following cachexia-related chronic medical diseases: cancer, COPD, HIV/AIDS, and liver cirrhosis. RESULTS: From the literature, 11 primary studies and 1 meta-analysis were selected. Among these studies, 3 evaluated TRT on cancer-associated cachexia, 3 on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 4 on HIV and AIDS, and 2 on liver cirrhosis. TRT showed mixed results favoring clinical improvement on each disease. CONCLUSIONS: Cachexia is commonly observed in chronic disease states. Its occurrence with hypogonadism, alongside the shared symptoms of these 2 conditions, points toward the management of cachexia through the administration of exogenous testosterone. Robust data in the literature support the use of testosterone in increasing lean body mass, improving energy levels, and enhancing the quality of life for patients with chronic disease. However, the data are variable, and further studies are warranted on the long-term efficacy of TRT in patients with cachexia.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Men with hypogonadism have reduced risk of prostate cancer mortality; whether testosterone treatment increases the risk of prostate safety events in men with hypogonadism remains controversial. Several studies including 4 larger randomized trials-the Testosterone Trials, TEstosterone and Atherosclerosis Progression in Aging Men (TEAAM) trial, Testosterone for Diabetes Mellitus trial, and Testosterone Replacement therapy for Assessment of long-term Vascular Events and efficacy ResponSE in hypogonadal men (TRAVERSE) trial-treated men with testosterone or placebo for 1 year or longer and reported prospectively ascertained prostate safety data. The TRAVERSE Trial, because of its large size, longer duration, and adjudication of prostate events, has provided comprehensive data on the risk of adverse prostate events during testosterone replacement therapy (TRT). Among men with hypogonadism, carefully screened to exclude those at high risk of prostate cancer, the incidences of high-grade or any prostate cancer, acute urinary retention, surgical procedure for benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate biopsy, or new pharmacologic therapy for lower urinary tract symptoms were low and did not differ between the testosterone and placebo groups. Testosterone did not worsen lower urinary tract symptoms. TRT was associated with a greater increase in prostate-specific antigen than placebo in the first year of treatment. CONCLUSION: Testosterone treatment of men with hypogonadism, screened to exclude those at high risk of prostate cancer, is associated with low risk of adverse prostate events. Baseline evaluation of prostate cancer risk and a standardized monitoring plan can minimize the risk of unnecessary prostate biopsy while enabling the detection of high-grade prostate cancers in men receiving TRT.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Anabolic steroid therapy has been associated with tendon injury, but there is a paucity of evidence associating physiologic testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) with tenosynovitis of the hand, specifically trigger finger and de Quervain tenosynovitis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between TRT and tenosynovitis of the hand. METHODS: This was a one-to-one exact matched retrospective cohort study using a large nationwide claims database. Records were queried between 2010 and 2019 for adult patients who filled a prescription for TRT for 3 consecutive months. Rates of new onset trigger finger and de Quervain tenosynovitis and subsequent steroid injection or surgery were identified using ICD-9, ICD-10, and Current Procedural Terminology billing codes. Single-variable chi-square analyses and multivariable logistic regression were used to compare rates in the TRT and control cohorts while controlling for potential confounding variables. Both unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (OR) are reported for each comparison. RESULTS: In the adjusted analysis, patients undergoing TRT were more than twice as likely to develop trigger finger compared to their matched controls. TRT was also associated with an increased likelihood of experiencing de Quervain tenosynovitis. Of the patients diagnosed with either trigger finger or de Quervain tenosynovitis over the 2-year period, patients with prior TRT were roughly twice as likely to undergo steroid injections or surgical release for both trigger finger and de Quervain tenosynovitis compared to the controls. CONCLUSIONS: TRT is associated with an increased likelihood of both trigger finger and de Quervain tenosynovitis, and an increased likelihood of requiring surgical release for both conditions.

Hence, we sought to evaluate the cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes among patients receiving testosterone therapy by using all recently published randomized controlled trials. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search on PubMed, EMBASE, and Clinicaltrial.gov for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from inception until September 30th, 2023. RESULTS: A total of 30 randomized trials with 11,502 patients were included in the final analysis. The mean age was ranging from 61.61 to 61.82 years. Pooled analysis of primary and secondary outcomes showed that the incidence of any CVD events (OR, 1.12 (95%CI: 0.77-1.62), P = 0.55), stroke (OR, 1.01 (95%CI: 0.68-1.51), P = 0.94), myocardial infarction (OR, 1.05 (95%CI: 0.76-1.45), P = 0.77), all-cause mortality (OR, 0.94 (95%CI: 0.76-1.17), P = 0.57), and CVD mortality (OR, 0.87 (95%CI: 0.65-1.15), P = 0.31) was comparable between TRT and placebo groups. CONCLUSION: Our analysis indicates that for patients with hypogonadism, testosterone replacement therapy does not increase the CVD risk and all-cause mortality.",

Recent data suggested a TRT-related increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF). The aim of this study was to systematic review and meta-analyze CV risk related to TRT as derived from placebo controlled randomized trials (RCTs). AREAS COVERED: An extensive Medline, Embase, and Cochrane search was performed. All placebo-controlled RCTs reporting data on TRT-related CV safety were considered. To better analyze the role of T on AF, population-based studies investigating the relationship between endogenous circulating T levels and AF incidence were also included and analyzed. EXPERT OPINION: Out of 3.615, 106 studies were considered, including 8.126 subjects treated with TRT and 7.310 patients allocated to placebo. No difference between TRT and placebo was observed when major adverse CV events were considered. Whereas the incidence of non-fatal arrhythmias and AF was increased in the only trial considering CV safety as the primary endpoint, this was not confirmed when all other studies were considered (MH-OR 1.61[0.84;3.08] and 1.44[0.46;4.46]). Similarly, no relationship between endogenous T levels and AF incidence was observed after the adjustment for confounders Available data confirm that TRT is safe and it is not related to an increased CV risk.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: In clinical trials, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) and testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) were shown to stimulate red blood cell production. Little is known if combination therapy poses risk of erythrocytosis in real world clinical practice. METHODS: This was a retrospective nationwide cohort study of US Veterans with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and baseline hematocrit between 38 and 50% who were prescribed SGLT-2i and/or TRT between 3/2013 and 10/2022 and had adequate adherence based on the proportion of days covered > 80%. Patients were divided into 3 groups: SGLT-2i only, TRT only, or combination therapy. Odds Ratio (OR) of new erythrocytosis defined as hematocrit level > 54% within 365 days of therapy initiation was calculated by logistic regression model adjusted for baseline hematocrit, age, BMI, obstructive sleep apnea, diuretic use, and smoking status. RESULTS: Of the entire cohort of 53,971 people with T2D, total of 756 (1.4%) patients developed erythrocytosis. In unadjusted analyses, the OR of new onset erythrocytosis was higher in the combined SGLT-2i and TRT group compared with the SGLT-2i or TRT group alone (4.99, 95% CI (3.10-7.71) and 2.91, 95% CI (1.87-4.31), respectively). In the models adjusted for baseline characteristics, patients on combination therapy had significantly higher odds of erythrocytosis compared to those on SGLT-2i (OR 3.80, 95% CI (2.27-6.11)) or TRT alone (OR 2.49, 95% CI (1.51-3.59)). Testosterone delivery route (topical vs injectable) did not modify increased odds of erythrocytosis. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we demonstrated that in large cohort of patients combined therapy with SGLT-2i and TRT is associated with increased erythrocytosis risk compared with either treatment alone. Given rising prevalence of SGLT-2i use, providers should consider periodic hematocrit assessment in persons receiving both SGLT-2i and TRT.",

Here we report the first case of a patient affected with a long-COVID syndrome leading to hypogonadism and treated with testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) and its effects on clinical and quality of life (QoL) outcomes. We encountered a 62-year-old man who had been diagnosed with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism about 2 months after recovery from COVID-19 underwent a complete physical examination, general and hormonal blood tests, and self-reported questionnaires administration before and after starting TRT. Following the TRT, both serum testosterone level and hypogonadism-related symptoms were improved, but poor effects occurred on general and neuropsychiatric symptoms and QoL. Therefore, hypogonadism does not appear to be the cause of neurocognitive symptoms, but rather a part of the long-COVID syndrome; as a consequence, starting TRT can improve the hypogonadism-related symptoms without clear benefits on general clinical condition and QoL, which are probably related to the long-COVID itself. Longer follow-up might clarify whether post-COVID hypogonadism is a transient condition that can revert as the patient recovers from long-COVID syndrome. LEARNING POINTS: Hypogonadism is more prevalent in post-COVID-19 patients compared with the general population. In these patients, hypogonadism may be part of long-COVID syndrome, and it is still unclear whether it is a transient condition or a permanent impairment of gonadal function. Testosterone replacement therapy has positive effects on hypogonadism-related clinic without clear benefits on general symptomatology and quality of life, which are more likely related to the long-COVID itself."

This paper evaluates the impact of testosterone undecanoate (TU) on blood pressure (BP) in men with adult-onset TD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of 737 men with adult-onset TD in an on-going, observational, prospective, cumulative registry, we studied changes in BP using non-parametric sign-rank tests at final assessment and fixed time points. We used multiple regression analysis to establish factors (baseline BP, age, change/baseline waist circumference [WC] and hematocrit [HCT] and follow-up) potentially associated with BP change in men on TU. RESULTS: TU was associated with significant reductions in systolic, diastolic BP and pulse pressure, regardless of antihypertensive therapy (at baseline or during follow-up), larger reductions were seen with concurrent antihypertensive therapy. In men never on antihypertensive agents, median changes (interquartile range [IQR]) in systolic BP, diastolic BP and pulse pressure were -12.5 (-19.0, -8.0), -8.0 (-14.0, -3.0), and -6.0 (-10.0, -1.0) mmHg, respectively at final assessment, with only baseline BP values inversely associated with these changes (HCT and WC were not significantly associated). In men not on TU, systolic BP, diastolic BP, and pulse pressure significantly increased. In the TU treated men only 1 of the 152 men (not on antihypertensive agents at baseline) were started on antihypertensives during follow-up. In contrast 33 of the 202 men on antihypertensives (at baseline or follow-up) had the antihypertensive agent discontinued by the end of the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: TU was associated with lowering of BP during follow-up irrespective of antihypertensive therapy, with greater reductions in men with higher baseline BP. In the context of SPC warnings, our long-term data provide reassurance on the effect of TU on BP."

Some transgenders receive hormonal therapy, which may lead to specific skin conditions. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether a causal relationship exists between hormonal therapy (specifically testosterone therapy) and unsatisfying surgical scarring, including hypertrophic and keloid scars. In addition, this study may serve as a basis for future studies, which may test means that aim to reduce such undesired effects. METHODS: In this retrospective, observational cohort study, data were collected regarding 170 patients who underwent mastectomy as a gender-affirming surgery by the senior author between 2003 and 2021. The medical records were analysed to obtain personal, medical (including the duration of testosterone treatment) and surgical information from the patients' medical files. A blinded evaluator assessed the surgical scars by reviewing the postoperative clinical pictures of the patients. The scars were rated using the validated Stony Brook Scar Evaluation Scale (SBSES). The use of pictures to assess surgical scars is described in the validation study of the SBSES and is, therefore, accepted. RESULTS: In total, 63 patients were included in the testosterone group and 63 were included in the non-testosterone treated group. The averages of the SBSES score were 2.74 and 2.66, respectively. The difference between the two averages was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: In our retrospective cohort study, we did not find the effect of testosterone therapy on post-operative surgical scars to be significant. EVIDENCE BASED MEDICINE (EBM) LEVEL: 3.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The link between the pre-diagnostic use of statins and testosterone replacement therapy and their impact on hormone-related cancers, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and male breast cancer survival remains a topic of controversy. Further, there is a knowledge gap concerning the joint effects of statins and testosterone replacement therapy on hormone-related cancer survival outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To examine the independent and joint effects of pre-diagnostic use of statins and testosterone replacement therapy on the risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality among older men diagnosed with hormone-related cancers, including prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and male breast cancer. METHODS: In 41,707 men (≥65 years) of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare 2007-2015, we identified 31,097 prostate cancer, 10,315 colorectal cancer, and 295 male breast cancer cases. Pre-diagnostic prescription of statins and testosterone replacement therapy was ascertained and categorized into four groups (Neither users, statins alone, testosterone replacement therapy alone, and Dual users). Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards and competing-risks (Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard) models were conducted. RESULTS: No significant associations were found in Cox-proportional hazard models for hormone-related cancers. However, in the Fine-Gray competing risk models among high-grade hormone-related cancers, statins alone had an 11% reduced risk of hormone-related cancer-specific death (hazard ratio: 0.89; 95% confidence interval: 0.81-0.99; p 0.0451). In the prostate cancer cohort with both statistical models, the use of testosterone replacement therapy alone had a 24% lower risk of all-cause death (hazard ratio: 0.76; 95% confidence interval: 0.59-0.97; p 0.0325) and a 57% lower risk of prostate cancer-specific death (hazard ratio: 0.43; 95% confidence interval: 0.24-0.75; p 0.0029). Similar inverse associations were found among aggressive prostate cancer cases with testosterone replacement therapy alone and statins alone. No significant associations were found in the colorectal cancer and male breast cancer sub-groups. CONCLUSION: Pre-diagnostic use of statins and testosterone replacement therapy showed a survival benefit with reduced mortality in high-grade hormone-related cancer patients (only statins) and aggressive prostate cancer patients in both statistical models. Findings of testosterone replacement therapy use in aggressive prostate cancer settings could facilitate clinical trials. Further studies with extended follow-up periods are needed to substantiate these findings.",

Increasing population age, medical benefits, and public awareness of TRT have resulted in increased prevalence of its utilization. However, TRT is not without concern for adverse risks including venous thromboembolic complications, cardiovascular events, and prostate issues. In the field of orthopaedic surgery, research is beginning to delineate the complex relationship between TRT and the development of orthopaedic conditions and potential effects on surgical interventions and outcomes. In this review, we discuss current literature surrounding TRT and subsequent development of osteoarthritis, incidence of total joint arthroplasty, musculotendinous pathology, postoperative infection risk, improvements in postoperative rehabilitation metrics, enhancement of osseous healing, and increased bone-implant integration. The authors suggest future areas of investigation that may provide guidance on how surgeons can mitigate adverse risks while optimizing benefits of TRT in the orthopaedic patient.",

Therefore, optimizing testosterone levels in men is an important step to maintaining a healthy body and mind, especially as we age. However, traditional testosterone replacement therapy has been shown to lead to male infertility, caused by negative feedback in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Recent advances in research have led to the discovery of many new methods of administration, which can have more or less suppressive effects on the HPG axis. Also, the usage of ancillary medications instead of or after testosterone administration might help maintain fertility in hypogonadal patients. The goal of this narrative review is to summarize the newest methods for optimizing fertility parameters in patients undergoing treatment for hypogonadism and to provide the necessary information for healthcare providers to make the right treatment choices.",

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and predictors of endocrine and reproductive outcomes in young adult survivors. A secondary aim was to assess possible associations between testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) and other endocrine, cardiovascular and psychosocial late effects. This nationwide study comprised 1212 male childhood cancer survivors aged 19-40 years, identified through the National Quality Registry for Childhood Cancer in Sweden. Median age at diagnosis during 1981-2017 was 7 (range 0-17) and at study 29 (19-40) years. The study combined self-report survey data with cancer treatment data from the national registry. Hormone-induced puberty was self-reported by 3.8% of the survivors and ongoing TRT by 6.0%. In separate logistic regression analyses, these treatments were associated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and cranial radiotherapy. Hormone-induced puberty was additionally associated with younger age at diagnosis. Men with TRT had a higher prevalence of other endocrine deficiencies, cholesterol medication, depressive symptoms and fatigue as well as a lower probability of living with a partner, having a biological child or current occupation. In the total male cohort, 28.2% reported having a biological child. Reassuring reproductive outcomes after less intensive therapies and low frequency of TRT were observed in young adult male childhood cancer survivors treated in the most recent treatment era. However, men with TRT suffered from several other endocrine, cardiovascular and psychosocial late effects, indicating a need for long-term monitoring of this high-risk group.",

However, the efficacy and safety of TRT remain controversial. An updated systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the effectiveness and security of TRT treating for LOH. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of TRT for LOH were searched in the databases of Pubmed, Embase, Clinicaltrials.gov and Cochrane from 1990 to 2023 and an updated meta-analysis was conducted. RESULTS: The results of 28 RCTs involving 3461 patients were included and scrutinized in this analysis. Among these, 11 RCTs were of long-term duration (≥12 months), while 18 RCTs were short-term studies (<12 months) comparing TRT with a placebo. TRT modalities comprised injection, oral administration, and transdermal administration. International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) (Weighted Mean difference (WMD) 3.26; 95%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.65-4.88; P<0.0001) was obviously improved in the TRT group. International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) (WMD 0.00; 95% CI -0.45-0.45; P=1.0), Prostate Volume (PV) (WMD 0.38; 95% CI -0.64-1.41; P=0.46), Maximum Flow Rate (Qmax) (WMD 1.86; 95% CI -0.98-4.69; P=0.20), Postvoid Residual Urine Volume (PVR) (WMD 3.20; 95% CI -5.87-12.28; P=0.49) and Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) (WMD 0.08; 95% CI -0.00-0.17; P=0.06) were not significantly statistical between two groups. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis reveals that TRT could improve the IIEF score of hypogonadal men without detriment to the IPSS score, PV, Qmax, PVR and PSA regardless of the administration method or duration of treatment.The meta-analysis was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42023413434).",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: As an increasingly popular therapeutic option, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) has gained significant notoriety for its health benefits in indicated populations, such as those suffering from hypogonadism. AREAS COVERED: Benefits such as improved libido, muscle mass, cognition, and quality of life have led to widened public interest in testosterone as a health supplement. No therapy exists without side effects; testosterone replacement therapy has been associated with side effects such as an increased risk of polycythemia, benign prostate hypertrophy (BPH), prostate cancer, gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, and infertility. Testosterone replacement therapy is often accompanied by several prophylactic co-therapies aimed at reducing the prevalence of these side effects. Literature searches for sections on the clinical benefits and risks associated with TRT were performed to include clinical trials, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews from the last 10 years. EXPERT OPINION: Data from clinical studies over the last decade suggest that the benefits of this therapy outweigh the risks and result in overall increased quality of life and remission of symptoms related to hypogonadism. With this in mind, the authors of this review suggest that carefully designed clinical trials are warranted for the investigation of TRT in symptomatic age-related hypogonadism.",

OBJECTIVE: We assessed the effects of testosterone-replacement therapy (TRT) in improving depressive symptoms in hypogonadal men with and without depressive symptoms enrolled in the TRAVERSE cardiovascular safety trial. METHODS: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was conducted at 316 trial sites. Participants included men, aged 45 to 80 years, with 2 fasting testosterone levels less than 300 ng/dL, 1 or more hypogonadal symptoms, cardiovascular disease (CVD), or increased risk of CVD. We evaluated 3 subgroups of participants: (1) men with rigorously defined, late-life-onset, low-grade persistent depressive disorder (LG-PDD, previously \"dysthymia\"); (2) all men with significant depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Score >4); and (3) all randomly assigned men. Intervention included 1.62% transdermal testosterone or placebo gel. Outcome measures included the proportions of participants (1) meeting criteria for LG-PDD or (2) with significant depressive symptoms; and changes in depressive symptoms, energy, sleep quality, and cognition in testosterone-treated vs placebo-treated men in the 3 subgroups. RESULTS: Of 5204 randomly assigned participants, 2643 (50.8%) had significant depressive symptoms, but only 49 (1.5%) met rigorous criteria for LG-PDD. Among those with LG-PDD, there was no significant difference in any outcome measure between the TRT and placebo groups, possibly reflecting low statistical power. In men with significant depressive symptoms (n = 2643) and in all randomly assigned participants (n = 5204), TRT was associated with modest but significantly greater improvements in mood and energy but not cognition or sleep quality. CONCLUSION: Depressive symptoms are common in middle-aged and older men with hypogonadism but LG-PDD is uncommon. TRT is associated with small improvements in mood and energy in hypogonadal men with and without significant depressive symptoms.",

      "abstract": "We sought to understand the relationship between hypogonadism and testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in hypogonadal men on the risk of developing localized and metastatic prostate cancer. We used the Merative MarketScan database of commercial claims encounters to identify men diagnosed with hypogonadism. These men were matched to eugonadal men who served as controls. Multivariate negative binomial regression analysis of prostate cancer diagnoses, hypogonadism, and TRT in hypogonadal men adjusting for various known confounding factors was used to understand the impact of hypogonadism and TRT on prostate cancer risk. We identified 3,222,904 men who met inclusion criteria, of which 50% were diagnosed with hypogonadism (1,611,452) and each were matched to a control (1,611,452). The incidence of prostate cancer was 2.16%, 1.55%, and 1.99% in eugonadal controls, hypogonadal men on TRT, and hypogonadal men without TRT, respectively (p < 0.001). Untreated hypogonadism was independently associated with a decreased risk of localized prostate cancer (IRR 0.46, 95% CI 0.43-0.50, p < 0.001) compared to eugonadal controls. Hypogonadal men on TRT also had a significantly decreased risk of localized prostate cancer (IRR 0.49, 95% CI 0.45-0.53, p < 0.001). Furthermore, hypogonadal men on TRT (IRR 0.21, 95% CI 0.19-0.24, p < 0.001) or without TRT (IRR 0.20, 95% CI 0.18-0.22, p < 0.001) both had significantly decreased risk of metastatic prostate cancer, respectively. Our population-based analysis suggests that untreated hypogonadism in men is associated with a 50% decreased incidence of localized prostate cancer and an 80% decreased incidence of metastatic prostate cancer. TRT in hypogonadal men was also associated with a decreased risk of subsequent prostate cancer. Further research is needed to better understand the relationship between hypogonadism and TRT in hypogonadal men on the risk of subsequent prostate cancer.",

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of TRT vs placebo on the incidences of high-grade prostate cancers (Gleason score ≥4 + 3), any prostate cancer, acute urinary retention, invasive prostate procedures, and pharmacologic treatment for lower urinary tract symptoms in men with hypogonadism. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized clinical trial enrolled 5246 men (aged 45-80 years) from 316 US trial sites who had 2 testosterone concentrations less than 300 ng/dL, hypogonadal symptoms, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) or increased CVD risk. Men with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentrations greater than 3.0 ng/mL and International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) greater than 19 were excluded. Enrollment took place between May 23, 2018, and February 1, 2022, and end-of-study visits were conducted between May 31, 2022, and January 19, 2023. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized, with stratification for prior CVD, to topical 1.62% testosterone gel or placebo. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary prostate safety end point was the incidence of adjudicated high-grade prostate cancer. Secondary end points included incidence of any adjudicated prostate cancer, acute urinary retention, invasive prostate surgical procedure, prostate biopsy, and new pharmacologic treatment. Intervention effect was analyzed using a discrete-time proportional hazards model. RESULTS: A total of 5204 men (mean [SD] age, 63.3 [7.9] years) were analyzed. At baseline, the mean (SD) PSA concentration was 0.92 (0.67) ng/mL, and the mean (SD) IPSS was 7.1 (5.6). The mean (SD) treatment duration as 21.8 (14.2) months in the TRT group and 21.6 (14.0) months in the placebo group. During 14 304 person-years of follow-up, the incidence of high-grade prostate cancer (5 of 2596 [0.19%] in the TRT group vs 3 of 2602 [0.12%] in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 1.62; 95% CI, 0.39-6.77; P = .51) did not differ significantly between groups; the incidences of any prostate cancer, acute urinary retention, invasive surgical procedures, prostate biopsy, and new pharmacologic treatment also did not differ significantly. Change in IPSS did not differ between groups. The PSA concentrations increased more in testosterone-treated than placebo-treated men. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In a population of middle-aged and older men with hypogonadism, carefully evaluated to exclude those at high risk of prostate cancer, the incidences of high-grade or any prostate cancer and other prostate events were low and did not differ significantly between testosterone- and placebo-treated men. The study's findings may facilitate a more informed appraisal of the potential risks of TRT. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03518034.",

We compared associations between testosterone undecanoate (TU), cardio-metabolic risk factors and mortality using non-parametric statistics followed by separate Cox regression models to determine if any association between TU and morality was independent of age and cardio-metabolic risk factors. Finally, the association between TU and mortality was studied in men stratified by cardio-metabolic risk. RESULTS: During a median follow-up interquartile range (IQR) of 114 (84-132) months, 94 of the 737 men died. TU (ref: non-treatment) was associated with mortality; hazard ratio = 0.23, 95% confidence intervals = 0.14-0.40. Cox's regression models showed the above association to be independent of baseline age, waist circumference, hemoglobin A1c, lipids, blood pressure, smoking, and type 2 diabetes. These variables remained associated with mortality. We finally stratified the men by the high-risk baseline variables and established that the association between mortality and TU was only evident in men at higher risk. A possible explanation could lie with the \"law of initial value,\" where greater improvements are evident following treatment in patients with worse baseline values. CONCLUSIONS: This study with long follow-up confirms that TTh is associated with lower mortality in men with adult-onset TD. This association was evident only in men with greater cardio-metabolic risk factors who demonstrated greater benefit.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Concerns have been expressed over the safety of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in men with late-onset hypogonadism (LOH). Previous studies have shown controversial results regarding the association of TRT with the risk of cardiovascular events or prostate cancer (PCa) incidence, aggressiveness, and mortality. This study explores the overall risk of PCa and risk by tumor grade and stage, as well as mortality from PCa and cardiovascular disease (CVD), among men treated with TRT compared to men without LOH and TRT use. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 78,615 men of age 55-67 years at baseline from the Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (FinRSPC). Follow-up started at randomization and ended at death, emigration, or a common closing date January 1st, 2017. Cox proportional hazards regression model with time-dependent variables and adjustment for age, trial arm, use of other medications, and Charlson comorbidity index was used. Comprehensive information on TRT purchases during 1995-2015 was obtained from the Finnish National Prescription Database. PCa cases were identified from the Finnish Cancer Registry and causes of death obtained from Statistics Finland. RESULTS: Over the course of 18 years of follow-up, 2919 men were on TRT, and 285 PCa cases were diagnosed among them. TRT users did not exhibit a higher incidence or mortality rate of PCa compared to non-users. On the contrary, men using TRT had lower PCa mortality than non-users (HR = 0.52; 95% CI 0.3-0.91). Additionally, TRT users had slightly lower CVD and all-cause mortality compared to non-users (HR = 0.87; 95% CI 0.75-1.01 and HR = 0.93; 95% CI 0.87-1.0, respectively). No time- or dose-dependency of TRT use was evident in any of the analyses. CONCLUSION: Men using TRT were not associated to increased risk for PCa and did not experience increased PCa- or CVD-specific mortality compared to non-users. Further studies considering blood testosterone levels are warranted.",

TRT in KS has the potential to modify thrombotic risk, but data are scarce. AIM: To assess effects of 18 months of TRT on hemostasis in KS and identify genes associated with the prothrombotic phenotype. METHODS: Untreated and TRT-treated men with KS were included at baseline and matched to healthy controls. TRT was initiated in untreated KS and all groups were reassessed after 18 months of follow-up. Thrombin generation was evaluated with or without thrombomodulin, and fibrin clot lysis was evaluated by turbidity measurements. RNA expression was assessed in blood, fat, and muscle tissue of patients with TRT-treated KS and controls. RESULTS: Thrombin generation with thrombomodulin was slightly increased in untreated KS, but overall KS was not associated with a hypercoagulable state. KS presented with fibrinolytic impairment associated with higher body fat and higher levels of fibrinogen. Eighteen months of TRT in KS was associated with a reduction in body fat and fibrinogen, attenuating the prothrombotic profile. The expression of ENPP4 was higher in men with KS and served as a key player among a group of genes associated with impaired fibrinolysis. CONCLUSION: KS is associated with a specific expression profile contributing to fibrinolytic impairment and increased thrombotic risk in the patients. TRT in patients with KS has the potential for alleviating the prothrombotic phenotype, in particular by reducing body fat and fibrinogen.",

However, there is a poor understanding about the combined association of statins and TTh with incident CVD among HRCa survivors and a matched cancer-free cohort. METHODS: We identified 44,330 men of whom 22,165 were previously diagnosed with HRCa, and 22,165 were age-and index-matched cancer-free in SEER-Medicare 2007-2015. Pre-diagnostic prescription of statins and TTh prior to CVD development was ascertained for this analysis in the two matched cohorts. Weighted multivariable-adjusted conditional logistic regression models were used to evaluate the independent and combined associations of statins and TTh with CVD. RESULTS: We found that use of statins (OR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.46-0.55) and TTh (OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.67-0.97) were each independently inversely associated with incident CVD in the overall sample. TTh plus statins was also inversely associated with CVD. Associations were similar in the matched cancer-free cohort. Among HRCa survivors, only statins and combination of TTh plus statins (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.44-0.98) were inversely associated with CVD, but the independent use of TTh was not associated with CVD. CONCLUSION: In general, pre-diagnostic use of statins and TTh, prior to CVD development, independently or in combination, were inversely associated with CVD in the overall, cancer-free population, and among HRCa survivors (mainly combination). Independent effects and combination of statins and TTh remained to be confirmed with specific CVD outcomes among HRCa survivors."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prescription of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) has increased in the United States in recent years, and though anabolic steroids have been associated with tendon rupture, there is a paucity of literature evaluating the risk of Achilles tendon injury with TRT. This study aims to evaluate the associative relationship between consistent TRT, Achilles tendon injury, and subsequent surgery. METHODS: This is a one-to-one matched retrospective cohort study utilizing the PearlDiver database. Records were queried for patients aged 35-75 who were prescribed at least 3 consecutive months of TRT between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2019. Achilles tendon injuries and subsequent surgeries were identified using ICD-9, ICD-10, and CPT billing codes. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare odds of Achilles tendon injury, Achilles tendon surgery, and revision surgery, with a p-value < 0.05 representing statistical significance. RESULTS: A sample of 423,278 patients who filled a TRT prescription for a minimum of 3 consecutive months was analyzed. The 2-year incidence of Achilles tendon injury was 377.8 (95% CI, 364.8-391.0) per 100,000 person-years in the TRT cohort, compared to 245.8 (95% CI, 235.4-256.6) in the control (p < 0.001). The adjusted analysis demonstrated TRT to be associated with a significantly increased likelihood of being diagnosed with Achilles tendon injury (aOR = 1.24, 95% CI, 1.15-1.33, p < 0.001). Of those diagnosed with Achilles tendon injury, 287/3,198 (9.0%) of the TRT cohort subsequently underwent surgery for their injury, compared to 134/2,081 (6.4%) in the control cohort (aOR = 1.54, 95% CI, 1.19-1.99, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant association between Achilles tendon injury and prescription TRT, with a concomitantly increased rate of undergoing surgical management. These results provide insight into the risk profile of TRT and further research into the science of tendon pathology in the setting of TRT is an area of continued interest.",

Population: men with TT <12 nmol l -1 or clear mention of hypogonadism in the inclusion criteria of patients; intervention: TRT; comparison: placebo or no therapy; outcomes: arterial thrombotic events (stroke, myocardial infarction [MI], upper limbs, and lower limbs), VTE (deep vein thrombosis [DVT], portal vein thrombosis, splenic thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism), and mortality. A total of 2423 abstracts were assessed for eligibility. Twenty-four studies, including 14 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), were finally included, with a total of 4027 and 310 288 hypotestosteronemic male patients, from RCTs and from observational studies, respectively. Based on RCT-derived data, TRT did not influence the risk of arterial thrombosis (odds ratio [OR] = 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.47-3.43, P = 0.64), stroke (OR = 1.34, 95% CI: 0.09-18.97, P = 0.83), MI (OR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.11-2.31, P = 0.39), VTE (OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 0.22-9.03, P = 0.71), pulmonary embolism (OR = 1.38, 95% CI: 0.27-7.04, P = 0.70), and mortality (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.20-2.38, P = 0.56). Meanwhile, when only observational studies are considered, a significant reduction in the risk of developing arterial thrombotic events, MI, venous thromboembolism, and mortality was observed. The risk for DVT remains uncertain, due to the paucity of RCT-based data. TRT in men with TT <12 nmol l -1 is safe from the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Further studies specifically assessing the risk of DVT in men on TRT are needed.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Testosterone deficiency causes mild anemia. Whether testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) can correct anemia or prevent the development of anemia in men with hypogonadism remains incompletely understood. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of TRT in correcting anemia in men with hypogonadism and anemia, and reducing the risk of developing anemia in those without anemia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized, placebo-controlled trial included men with hypogonadism at 316 US sites enrolled between May 2018 and February 2022. This study was nested within the Testosterone Replacement Therapy for Assessment of Long-term Vascular Events and Efficacy Response in Hypogonadal Men (TRAVERSE) Study, which evaluated the effect of TRT on major adverse cardiovascular events in middle-aged and older men with hypogonadism. Eligible participants were aged 45 to 80 years, with 2 testosterone concentration results below 300 ng/dL, hypogonadal symptoms, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) or increased CVD risk. The last study visit took place in January 2023. Data were analyzed between March and August 2023. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized with stratification for preexisting CVD to 1.62% testosterone gel or placebo gel daily for the study duration. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Proportion of participants with anemia (hemoglobin below 12.7 g/dL) whose anemia remitted (hemoglobin 12.7 g/dL or above) over the study duration. Secondary end points included incidence of anemia among men who were not anemic. Binary end points were analyzed using repeated-measures log-binomial regression. RESULTS: A total of 5204 men were included, 815 with anemia (mean [SD] age, 64.8 [7.7] years; 247 Black [30.3%], 544 White [66.7%], 24 other [2.9%]) and 4379 without anemia (mean [SD] age, 63.0 [7.9] years; 629 Black [14.4%], 3603 White [82.3%], 147 other [3.4%]). Anemia corrected in a significantly greater proportion of testosterone-treated than placebo-treated men at 6 months (143 of 349 [41.0%] vs 103 of 375 [27.5%]), 12 months (152 of 338 [45.0%] vs 122 of 360 [33.9%]), 24 months (124 of 290 [42.8%] vs 95 of 307 [30.9%]), 36 months (94 of 216 [43.5%] vs 76 of 229 [33.2%]), and 48 months (41 of 92 [44.6%] vs 38 of 97 [39.2%]) (P = .002). Among participants without anemia, a significantly smaller proportion of testosterone-treated men developed anemia than placebo-treated men. Changes in hemoglobin were associated with changes in energy level. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In middle-aged and older men with hypogonadism and anemia, TRT was more efficacious than placebo in correcting anemia. Among men who were not anemic, a smaller proportion of testosterone-treated men developed anemia than placebo-treated men. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03518034.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is an under-recognized medical disease. The main risk factors for OSAS are male sex, older age, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, that are also associated with male hypogonadism (MH). Therefore, obesity has been classically identified as the most evident link between OSAS and MH. However, OSAS is per se linked to the development of MH by a combined effect of hypoxia, increased night-time awakenings, reduced sleep efficiency and fragmented sleep. Similarly, MH might represent a risk factor for OSAS, mainly related to sleep disturbances that are frequently associated with low testosterone. Data on testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in patients with OSAS are limited. Nevertheless, TRT is generally contraindicated by guidelines in the presence of untreated or severe OSAS. TRT might in fact worse OSAS symptoms in different ways. Furthermore, OSAS has been proposed to be a risk factor for secondary polycythaemia and TRT might exacerbate polycythaemia. Therefore, TRT in hypogonadal men affected by untreated OSAS or severe OSAS should be considered with caution and in a personalised way. Nevertheless, the type and dosage of TRT should be considered, as short-term high-dose TRT might worsen OSAS, whereas long-term lower doses could eventually determine a clinical improvement of symptoms of OSAS. Here we reviewed the data on the association between OSAS, MH and TRT, including the opportunity of assessment of patients who develop signs and symptoms of OSAS during TRT by polysomnography."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Late-onset hypogonadism is the clinical entity characterised by low testosterone concentrations associated with clinical symptoms in the absence of organic disease in ageing men. It has been associated with metabolic syndrome, reduced bone mineral density, and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality risk. Although testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) reverses most of these conditions in young hypogonadal men, the risk/benefit ratio of TRT in older men is debatable. AIM: To update the 2015 EMAS statement on TRT in older men with new research on late-onset hypogonadism and TRT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature review and consensus of expert opinion. SUMMARY RECOMMENDATIONS: TRT should be offered only to symptomatic older men with confirmed low testosterone concentrations after explaining the uncertainties regarding the long-term safety of this treatment. TRT may be offered to men with severe hypogonadism and erectile dysfunction to improve sexual desire, erectile, and orgasmic function. It should also be considered in hypogonadal men with severe insulin resistance or pre-diabetes mellitus. TRT may also be considered, in combination with proven treatment strategies, for osteoporosis, or for selected patients with persistent mild depressive symptoms and/or low self-perceived quality of life, combined with standard medical care for each condition. TRT is contraindicated in hypogonadal men actively seeking fertility treatment. Due to a lack of data, TRT should not be routinely used in older men to improve exercise capacity/physical function, improve cognitive function, or prevent cognitive decline. TRT must be avoided in older, frail men with known breast cancer or untreated prostate cancer and all men who have had myocardial infarction or stroke within the last four months, and those with severe or decompensated heart failure. The quality of evidence regarding patients with previous prostate cancer or cardiovascular disease is too low to draw definitive conclusions. Any limits on duration of use are arbitrary, and treatment should continue for as long as the man feels the benefits outweigh the risks for him, and decisions must be made on an individual basis. Withdrawal should be considered when hypogonadism is reversed after the resolution of underlying disorder. Short-acting transdermal preparations should be preferred for TRT initiation in older men, but injectable forms may be considered subsequently. Older men on TRT should be monitored at 3, 6, and 12 months after initiation and at least yearly thereafter, or earlier and more frequently if indicated. Evaluation should include assessment of the clinical response, and measurement of total testosterone, haematocrit, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentrations. Bone density and/or quality should also be assessed. Obese and overweight patients should be encouraged to undergo lifestyle modifications, including exercise and weight loss, to increase endogenous testosterone.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate the effect of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) on metabolic indexes in patients with hypogonadism. METHODS: We searched the databases of CNKI, CBM, Wanfang Data, VIP, PubMed, Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library from the establishment to May 2021 for clinical randomized controlled trials (RCT) on the improvement of metabolic indexes of the patients with hypogonadism treated by TRT. According to the inclusion and excretion criteria, we screened the literature, extracted the data and evaluated the quality of the included RCTs, followed by statistical analysis with the STATA15.1 software. RESULTS: Totally 19 RCTs with 1 553 cases were included. Compared with placebo, TRT effectively reduced the levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and fasting insulin (FINS), improved Homeostatic Model Assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), decreased total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), increased the body mass index (BMI), lowered the waist circumference (WC), but elevated the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of the patients. No statistically significant differences were observed in the improvement of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and triglyceride (TG) between the TRT-treated patients and placebo controls. The results of Egger's and Begg's tests showed no significant publication bias among the studies. CONCLUSION: TRT can significantly improve metabolic indexes in patients with hypogonadism, though further studies are needed to confirm its long-term efficacy and safety in patients with metabolic disorders.",

METHODS: A meta-analysis of 26 randomized controlled trials involving 10 941 participants was conducted. Various clinical outcomes, including all-cause mortality, cardiovascular-related mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary embolism, and venous thrombosis, were assessed. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were observed between the TRT group and the control group in terms of these clinical outcomes. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias assessment supported the robustness of the findings. Meta-regression analysis found no significant associations between clinical outcomes and potential covariates, including age, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and smoking. DISCUSSION: Previous research on TRT and cardiovascular events, with comparisons to studies like the Testosterone Trials and the studies conducted by Vigen et al, Finkle et al, Layton et al, and Wallis et al, is provided. The significance of the systematic review and meta-analysis approach is emphasized, particularly its exclusive focus on hypogonadal patients. CONCLUSION: This study offers reassurance that TRT does not increase mortality risk or worsen cardiovascular outcomes in hypogonadal men. However, further research, especially long-term studies involving diverse populations, is essential to strengthen the evidence base and broaden the applicability of these findings.",

RECENT FINDINGS: A few published studies suggest a link between TRT and CV events. These studies contained flaws, and many other studies reveal a reduction in CV events. Hypogonadism is associated with increased mortality in men with CVD. TRT in hypogonadal men can improve many CVD risk factors, reduce QT interval prolongation, lead to better outcomes in heart failure patients, and slow the progression of atherosclerosis. The use of TRT to achieve physiologic testosterone concentrations in men does not pose a threat to CV health and has demonstrated a cardioprotective effect.",

The Testosterone Trials (The T Trials) showed testosterone (T) treatment compared with placebo in older hypogonadal men was associated with decreases in cholesterol and insulin levels suggesting that T treatment may improve NAFLD. OBJECTIVE: Compare effects of T vs placebo treatment on NAFLD scores and liver scans in elderly hypogonadal men. METHODS: Secondary data analyses from 479 older hypogonadal men with total T < 275 ng/dL from The T Trials were performed. Three clinical liver fat scores-lipid accumulation product index, hepatic steatosis index, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease-metabolic syndrome score-and liver computed tomography (CT) Hounsfield units and liver to spleen ratio were evaluated at baseline and 12 months after treatment. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences of change in lipid accumulation product index (P = .98), hepatic steatosis index (P = .67), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease-metabolic syndrome (P = .52) in 246 men treated with T compared with 233 treated with placebo for 12 months. Liver CT showed no statistically significant difference of change in Hounsfield units (P = .24; n = 71 for T, n = 69 for placebo) and liver to spleen ratio (P = .74; n = 55 for T, n = 62 for placebo) between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our study did not show improvement of NAFLD in older hypogonadal men after 12 months of T vs placebo treatment, as assessed by 3 clinical scores and liver CT for hepatic steatosis. Future studies with longer treatment duration and additional NAFLD diagnostic modalities as primary outcome are warranted.",

Although the definition of a low testosterone level varies among guidelines, a serum total testosterone level of less than 300 to 350 ng/dL on two separate morning blood samples is considered a low level. To receive exogenous testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), patients should meet criteria for hypogonadism, which is defined as a low testosterone level and signs or symptoms of hypogonadism. Management discussions should be individualized to address patient needs and goals. Counseling before therapy should include shared decision-making regarding risks, benefits, and expectations. Numerous testosterone formulations are available, ranging from topical gels to intramuscular injections. The choice of formulation depends on factors such as cost and patient preference. Use of TRT is limited by contraindications, adverse effects, and a lack of long-term safety data. Patients receiving this therapy require close monitoring. For patients who wish to avoid use of exogenous hormones, are not candidates for TRT, or are unable to tolerate its adverse effects, several nonhormonal pharmacotherapies are available.",

OBJECTIVE: The Testosterone Replacement therapy for Assessment of long-term Vascular Events and efficacy ResponSE in hypogonadal men (TRAVERSE) study evaluated the effect of TRT on major adverse cardiovascular events in middle-aged and older men with hypogonadism. The Sexual Function Study, nested within the parent trial, determined testosterone's efficacy in improving sexual activity, hypogonadal symptoms, libido, and erectile function among men reporting low libido. METHODS: Among 5204 men, 45-80 years, with 2 testosterone concentrations <300 ng/dL, hypogonadal symptoms, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) or increased CVD risk enrolled in the TRAVERSE trial, 1161 with low libido were enrolled in the Sexual Function Study (587 randomized to receive 1.62% testosterone gel and 574 to placebo gel for the duration of their participation in the study). Primary outcome was change from baseline in sexual activity score. Secondary outcomes included hypogonadal symptoms, erectile function, and sexual desire. RESULTS: TRT was associated with significantly greater improvement in sexual activity than placebo (estimated mean [95% CI] between-group difference 0.49 [0.19,0.79] and 0.47 [0.11, 0.83] acts per day at 6 and 12 months, respectively; omnibus test P = .011); treatment effect was maintained at 24 months.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of TRT in older men with low testosterone levels. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were systematically searched for articles published between January 1990 and April 2020. We included randomized controlled studies that investigated the effect of TRT and included older men (age &gt;60 years) with relatively low testosterone levels. Studies were extracted following the PRISMA flowchart, and the included randomized controlled trials were evaluated using RoB 2.0. Our main outcome was muscle strength changes after TRT evaluated using a metaregression of confounding factors. Secondary outcomes included changes in physical performance and the risk ratio of adverse events. Random-effects meta-analyses of TRT on muscle strength and physical function were performed. RESULTS: Thirteen studies with 2,043 patients were included. The mean age of subjects in various studies ranged from 65.9 years to 76 years. Transdermal testosterone dosages ranged from 5 to 10 g/day, while intramuscular options were 125 mg/week or 200 mg every 2 weeks. Oral testosterone supplementation was given at 160 mg/day in one study. Pooled meta-analyses revealed greater muscle strength improvement after TRT compared with placebo (Hedges' g = 0.21; 95% CI: = 0.15-0.28). Intramuscular administration of TRT had greater efficacy (Hedges' g = 0.74; 95% CI: = 0.34-1.14) than transdermal and oral TRT (p &lt; 0.001). A metaregression revealed that baseline serum total testosterone was associated with muscle strength improvement (β = -0.004, p = 0.002). The risk ratios of adverse events, including elevated prostate-specific antigen, acute coronary syndrome, and prostate cancer, were not significantly different. CONCLUSION: TRT improved muscle strength in older, relatively hypogonadal men. The effect was more pronounced in populations with lower baseline testosterone levels."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vascular graft infections (VGIs) are a major source of morbidity following vascular bypass surgery. Hypogonadal men may be at increased risk for impaired wound healing and infections, but it is unclear if testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) mitigates this risk. We designed this study to evaluate the relationship between hypogonadism and the use of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) with subsequent risk for developing a VGI. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of claims in the MarketScan database identifying men greater than 18 years of age who underwent placement of a prosthetic graft in the peripheral arterial circulation from January 2009 to December 2020. Patients were stratified based on diagnosis of hypogonadism and use of TRT within 180 days before surgery. The primary outcome was VGI and the need for surgical excision. The association between hypogonadism and TRT use on risk of VGI was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier plots and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: We identified 18,312 men who underwent a prosthetic bypass graft procedure in the upper and lower extremity during the study period, of which 802 (5%) had diagnosis of hypogonadism. Among men with hypogonadism, 251 (31%) were receiving TRT. Patients on TRT were younger, more likely to be diabetic, and more likely develop a VGI during follow-up (14% vs. 8%; P < 0.001) that was in the lower extremity. At 5 years, freedom from VGI was significantly lower for hypogonadal men on TRT than patients not on TRT or without hypogonadism (Log rank P < 0.001). In Cox regression models adjusted for age, diabetes, obesity, smoking, corticosteroid use, and procedure type, hypogonadal men on TRT were at a significantly increased risk of graft infection (hazard ratio (HR):1.94, 95% confidence interval (CI):1.4-2.7; P < 0.001) compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates TRT among hypogonadal men is associated with an increased risk of prosthetic VGIs. Temporary cessation of TRT should be considered for men undergoing prosthetic graft implants, particularly those in the lower extremity.",

METHODS: A retrospective review of our CaP database was performed. Patients who received TRT while on AS were identified and were matched to a cohort of patient on AS while not on TRT (1:3) using propensity score matching. Treatment-free survival (TFS) was computed using Kaplan Meier method. Multivariable Cox regression model was used to evaluate variables associated with treatment. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients in the TRT group were matched to 72 patients without TRT. Median follow-up was 5.82 years (IQR 3.27-9.30). There was no significant difference in conversion to treatment (24% vs. 21%, P = 1.00) There was no significant difference in TFS (log rank P = 0.87). Prostate specific antigen (PSA) density was the only variable associated TFS (HR 1.08, 95%CI 1.03-1.13, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: TRT was not associated with conversion to treatment in this matched analysis among patients with localized prostate cancer on AS.",

METHODS: In 25 796 cisgender women and 1580 transgender people (≥30 years old) who were enrolled in the Optum's deidentified Clinformatics Data Mart Database (2007-2021), we identified 6288 pre- and postmenopausal cisgender women and 262 transgender people diagnosed with incident composite of CVD (coronary artery disease [CAD], congestive heart failure, stroke, and myocardial infarction). Prediagnostic prescription of TTh was ascertained for this analysis. Multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the independent association of TTh with incident CVD. RESULTS: We found a 24% increased risk of CVD (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.15-1.34), 26% risk of CAD (HR = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.14-1.39), and a 29% risk of stroke (HR = 1.29; 95% CI, 1.14-1.45) after comparing cisgender women who used TTh with nonusers. Stratification by age group showed similar effects of TTh on CVD, CAD, and stroke. Among transgender people, TTh did not increase the risk of composite CVD, including by age stratification. CONCLUSION: Use of TTh increased the risk of CVD, CAD, and stroke among cisgender women but not among transgender people. TTh is becoming more widely accepted in women, and it is the main medical treatment for transgender males. Therefore, use of TTh should be further investigated for the prevention of CVD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The cardiovascular safety of testosterone-replacement therapy in middle-aged and older men with hypogonadism has not been determined. METHODS: In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, noninferiority trial, we enrolled 5246 men 45 to 80 years of age who had preexisting or a high risk of cardiovascular disease and who reported symptoms of hypogonadism and had two fasting testosterone levels of less than 300 ng per deciliter. Patients were randomly assigned to receive daily transdermal 1.62% testosterone gel (dose adjusted to maintain testosterone levels between 350 and 750 ng per deciliter) or placebo gel. The primary cardiovascular safety end point was the first occurrence of any component of a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke, assessed in a time-to-event analysis. A secondary cardiovascular end point was the first occurrence of any component of the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or coronary revascularization, assessed in a time-to-event analysis. Noninferiority required an upper limit of less than 1.5 for the 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio among patients receiving at least one dose of testosterone or placebo. RESULTS: The mean (±SD) duration of treatment was 21.7±14.1 months, and the mean follow-up was 33.0±12.1 months. A primary cardiovascular end-point event occurred in 182 patients (7.0%) in the testosterone group and in 190 patients (7.3%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 1.17; P<0.001 for noninferiority). Similar findings were observed in sensitivity analyses in which data on events were censored at various times after discontinuation of testosterone or placebo. The incidence of secondary end-point events or of each of the events of the composite primary cardiovascular end point appeared to be similar in the two groups. A higher incidence of atrial fibrillation, of acute kidney injury, and of pulmonary embolism was observed in the testosterone group. CONCLUSIONS: In men with hypogonadism and preexisting or a high risk of cardiovascular disease, testosterone-replacement therapy was noninferior to placebo with respect to the incidence of major adverse cardiac events.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Testicular cancer survivors (TCS) are at risk of Leydig cell insufficiency, which is a condition characterized by elevated luteinising hormone (LH) in combination with low levels of testosterone. It has been suggested that this condition is associated with impaired metabolic profile and low bone mineral density (BMD). The primary aim of the randomized double-blind trial NCT02991209 was to evaluate metabolic profile after 12-months testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in TCS with mild Leydig cell insufficiency. Here we present the secondary outcomes of changes in BMD and markers of bone turnover. METHODOLOGY: In total, 69 TCS with mild Leydig cell insufficiency were randomized 1:1 to 12 months TRT (n = 35) (Tostran, gel, 2%, applied transdermally, with a maximum daily dose of 40 mg) or placebo (n = 34). BMD and markers of bone turnover were evaluated at baseline, after 6- and 12-months TRT, and 3-months post-treatment. Linear mixed effects models were used to analyse changes in BMD, N-terminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen (P1NP) and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX). RESULTS: After 12 months treatment, TRT was not associated with a statistically significant difference in BMD compared to placebo; total body BMD: 0.01 g/cm2 (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.01 - 0.02), BMD of the lumbar spine: 0.01 g/cm2, (95% CI: -0.01-0.03), BMD of the left femoral neck: 0.00, (95% CI: -0.01-0.02). TRT was associated with a small but statistically significant increase in P1NP: 11.65 µg/L (95% CI: 3.96, 19.35), while there was no difference in CTX. CONCLUSION: 12 months of TRT did not change BMD, while there was as small and clinically irrelevant increase in P1NP compared to placebo in TCS with mild Leydig cell insufficiency. The findings need validation in a larger cohort.",

This study was conducted to determine the predictors of TRT efficacy for LOH. Fifty-six patients who visited our Men's Health Clinic (Kawanishi City Medical Center, Kawanishi and Hyogo Medical University, Nishinomiya, Hyogo, Japan) between November 2003 and June 2021 with data available before and after TRT were enrolled. They were divided into responders (Group 1; n = 45, accounting for 80.4%) and nonresponders (Group 2; n = 11, accounting for 19.6%) based on the clinical response to TRT, including patient satisfaction. Factors noted before TRT included age, body mass index, aging males' symptoms score, sexual health inventory for men, luteinizing hormone, follicular-stimulating hormone, testosterone, free testosterone, prolactin (PRL), estradiol (E2), and testosterone/estradiol (T/E2) ratio in serum. For statistical analysis, a multivariable logistic regression model was used. Univariate analysis revealed PRL (odds ratio [OR]: 0.9624; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.9316-0.9943, P < 0.05), E2 (OR: 0.8692; 95% CI: 0.7745-0.9754, P < 0.05), and T/E2 ratio (OR: 1.1312; 95% CI: 1.0106-1.2661, P < 0.05) to be predictive factors. Multivariate analyses showed that T/E2 ratio was an independent predictive factor (OR: 1.1593; 95% CI: 1.0438-1.2875, P < 0.01). The present results suggest that a low value for T/E2 ratio may predict a reduced response to TRT. The T/E2 ratio threshold to predict nonresponders based on receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was shown to be 17.3. Although additional studies with larger number of patients are necessary, we propose the determination of serum E2 level and testosterone level prior to performing TRT.",

Hormonal replacement therapy, or testosterone replacement therapy, is associated with improved neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes in males with 49,XXXXY. Two forms of testosterone replacement therapy, early hormonal treatment (EHT) and hormonal booster therapy (HBT), are associated with improved neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes in these boys. This study investigates the impact of EHT and HBT on behavioral symptoms in males with 49,XXXXY. METHODS: A total of 59 individuals were divided into 4 groups: 19 no testosterone (no-T), 23 EHT, 6 HBT, and 11 EHT and HBT. An analysis of variance examined group differences on the Child Behavior Checklist and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function ranging from 5 to 18 years. RESULTS: Although no differences were identified on the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, the 3 hormonal replacement therapy groups presented with decreased complications on numerous variables on the Child Behavior Checklist; these include somatic complaints (P = .0095), somatic problems (P = .041), internalizing problems (P = .034), externalizing problems (P = .0001), and withdrawn/depression (P = .025). CONCLUSION: This study presents evidence that HBT may be a beneficial treatment for individuals with 49,XXXXY.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Rehabilitation medicine in a tertiary care hospital involves attending to many patients affected by intensive care unit (ICU)-associated weakness (ICU-AW) and hospital-associated deconditioning (HAD). These conditions contribute to poor long-term functional outcomes and increased mortality. We explored the role of short-term adjunctive androgen therapy in this group of patients in improving the rehabilitative outcomes. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of five patients with either ICU-AW or HAD who were given testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) or oxandrolone for a total of 2 weeks during the period from April to November 2020 was undertaken. During the 2-week trial period, the subjects underwent standard rehabilitation therapy. RESULTS: Grip strength was used as the primary outcome measure, and the mean improvement was 4.2 kg (+24.9%), which is encouraging in a 2-week timeframe. This was matched with good functional recovery in terms of distance ambulated and less assistance needed for ambulation. Sex hormone analysis was also done before initiation of TRT, and it showed that four out of five of the subjects were biochemically hypogonadal. None of the subjects dropped out or experienced any significant adverse events over the 2-week trial period. All the subjects except one improved to full independence at 3 months post-discharge. CONCLUSION: TRT has the potential to be used as a useful adjunct to standard rehabilitation in enhancing functional recovery in critically ill patients. A multidisciplinary approach would ensure that suitable patients benefit from optimal nutrition, optimal rehabilitation and synergistic testosterone therapy in a clinically sound and resource-efficient fashion.",

      "abstract": "Male hypogonadism affects 10-30% of the male population and is often under-recognized and under-treated. Different replacement formulations exist, each with specific benefits and limitations. These replacements include gels, patches and short- and long-acting injectables. JATENZO® (oral testosterone undecanoate; Clarus Therapeutics Inc., Northbrook, IL, US) is the first oral formulation of testosterone approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. TLANDO® (oral testosterone undecanoate; Lipocine Inc., Salt Lake City, UT, US), another oral testosterone formulation, has also recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Based on unique chemistry using a self-emulsifying drug delivery system and lymphatic absorption, JATENZO and TLANDO address some of the limitations of other dosing routes while providing a safe option without evidence of liver dysfunction. This review discusses various testosterone treatment options, focusing on the role and pharmacokinetics of the new oral formulations."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Chronic liver disease is often associated with testosterone deficiency. However, testosterone replacement does not improve hepatic function or survival with diseased liver. So far, to our knowledge, testosterone replacement therapy after successful livertransplantforfunctional sarcopenia has not been studied. We had 3 goals: (1) define postoperative functional sarcopenia afterlivertransplant with serum testosterone level; (2) examine the role of short-term testosterone replacement therapy with active in-bed exercise of upper and lower extremity joints; and (3) correlate functional sarcopenia with skeletal muscle index and skeletal muscle density in relation to ascites, pleural effusion subtracted body mass index. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 16 liver transplant recipients who had been receiving posttransplanttestosterone replacementtherapy with functional sarcopenia. Preoperative and postoperative demographics and laboratory and radiological data were retrieved; body mass index, skeletal muscle index, and skeletal muscle density were calculated. For this retrospective study, institutional review board approval was obtained before the electronic database was reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS: Mean testosterone level was 28.3 ng/dL (<5% of expected). Twelve patients received 1 dose, and the remaining 4 patients received >1 dose oftestosterone cypionate, 200 mg. Mean hospital stay was 26 days. Seven patients were discharged home, with the remaining patients to a rehabilitation facility or nursing home. One patient died from a cardiac event, and another patient died from recurrent metastatic malignancy. The 1-year and 5-year actuarial patient and graft survival rates were 93.8% and 87.5%, respectively. Overall, 5 patients were sarcopenic by skeletal muscle index, and 6 patients had poor muscle quality by skeletal muscle density. CONCLUSIONS: Testosterone deficiency after liver transplant exists with functional sarcopenia. Two- thirds of such recipients have low skeletal muscle index and/or have low skeletal muscle density. Short- term testosterone replacement therapy with in-bed active exercise provides 5-year patient and graft survival of 87.5%.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the frequency of sexual dysfunction and the effect of short-term testosterone replacement therapy on sexual functions in congenital hypogonadism patients. Furthermore, we sought to reveal the consistency of the self-report scales used for the diagnosis of sexual dysfunction and the relationship between biochemical parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted on 47 young male patients aged above 18 years who were diagnosed with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Short (IIEF-5) and long (IIEF-15) forms of the International Index of Erectile Function and Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX) were applied before treatment under the supervision of a physician. The patients' blood pressure, height, and weight were measured, and their luteinizing hormone (LH), FSH, and total testosterone levels were recorded. Patients who started their treatments were called for a follow-up checkup after 6 months. Their blood pressure, height, and weight were measured by reapplying the ASEX, IIEF-5, and IIEF-15. In addition, their LH, FSH, and total testosterone levels in the biochemical tests were rerecorded. RESULTS: In this study, the sexual dysfunction status of patients diagnosed with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism before and after treatment was evaluated using the ASEX, IIEF-15, and IIEF-5 scales. A decrease in sexual dysfunction was observed in all three scales after treatment compared with that before treatment. The IIEF-5 and IIEF-15 scales were found to be uncorrelated in terms of the pretreatment values but were correlated in terms of the post-treatment values. Although a correlation was observed between ASEX and IIEF- 5 before treatment, no correlation was detected between ASEX and IIEF-15. After the treatment, ASEX was found to be correlated with both IIEF-5 and IIEF-15. The results of the scales indicated the correlation in all categories, except the pretreatment results of the IIEF-15 scale. CONCLUSION: The results of the current study demonstrated a significant improvement in the sexual function of hypogonadism patients undergoing short-term testosterone therapy. The ASEX, IIEF-5, and IIEF-15 scales used in the diagnosis and follow-up of sexual dysfunction were useful for evaluating sexual functions in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Depression is a common disorder that affects millions globally and is linked to reduced quality of life and mortality. Its pathophysiology is complex and there are several forms of treatment proposed in the literature with differing side effect profiles. Many patients do not respond to treatment which warrants augmentation with other treatments and the investigation of novel treatments. One of these treatments includes testosterone therapy which evidence suggests might improve depressed mood in older patients with low levels of testosterone and helps restore physical impairments caused by age-related hormonal changes. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to synthesize information regarding clinical depression, its treatment options, and the efficacy and safety of testosterone treatment for the treatment of depression. METHODS: This review utilized comprehensive secondary and tertiary data analysis across many academic databases and published work pertaining to the topic of interest. RESULTS: Within some subpopulations such as men with dysthymic disorder, treatment resistant depression, or low testosterone levels, testosterone administration yielded positive results in the treatment of depression. Additionally, rodent models have shown that administering testosterone to gonadectomized male animals reduces symptoms of depression. Conversely, some studies have found no difference in depressive symptoms after treatment with testosterone when compared with placebo. It was also noted that over administration of testosterone is associated with multiple adverse effects and complications. CONCLUSION: The current evidence provides mixed conclusions on the effectiveness of testosterone therapy for treating depression. More research is needed in adult men to see if declining testosterone levels directly influence the development of depression."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Men with Klinefelter syndrome (KS) are routinely offered testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) suggested to potentially promote platelet aggregation and increase cardiovascular risk. OBJECTIVE: We investigated platelet aggregation in men with KS before and during TRT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one adult men with KS participated, of which 20 had no history of TRT at baseline, with 15 completing follow-up after 18 months TRT. Further, we included 21 adult men with KS on long-term TRT (>10 years) and a male reference population. We assessed platelet impedance aggregometry using adenosine diphosphate (6.5 μM), thrombin-receptor-activating-peptide-6 (TRAP 32 μM), and arachidonic acid (ASPI 0.5 mM) as agonists in KS compared to a male reference population and stratified by route of TRT administration. RESULTS: Platelet aggregation among men with KS at baseline or during TRT was not increased compared with the male reference population. For all three agonist, no change was seen in platelet aggregation in KS at follow-up compared with baseline (p ≥ 0.2). Platelet aggregation was not associated with total testosterone and furthermore, platelet count was not affected by treatment with testosterone. Men with KS treated with testosterone gel showed slightly increased TRAP- and ASPI-induced platelet aggregation compared with those treated with testosterone injection (p = 0.02 and p = 0.04, respectively). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: We observed normal platelet aggregation in men with KS before TRT and following both short and long term treatment. Our findings do not support an independent role of platelets in driving the cardiovascular risk in KS.",
