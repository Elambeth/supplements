      "abstract": "Background: Hormonal fluctuations across the menstrual cycle can significantly impair physical performance, neuromuscular function, and cognitive processing in female athletes, particularly during the premenstrual phase. Emerging evidence suggests that dark chocolate (DC), rich in flavonoids, polyphenols, magnesium, and theobromine, may exert anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and neuroprotective effects. This study investigated the acute effects of 85% DC supplementation on cognitive and physical performance, as well as delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), in female CrossFit® athletes across four distinct hormonal phases. Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, fifteen trained eumenorrheic female CrossFit® athletes completed three intervention conditions: dark chocolate (DC), placebo (PLA), and control (CON). Participants were evaluated during four distinct menstrual phases-menstrual, follicular, luteal, and premenstrual syndrome (PMS)-over three consecutive menstrual cycles. In each phase, participants consumed 30 g/day of either DC or PLA for three days, followed by performance testing on day four. Functional and cognitive performance were assessed via the CINDY WOD, handgrip strength (HGS), and Stroop tests (reaction time and correct answer percentage, CAP). DOMS was measured using a 100 mm visual analog scale at baseline and at 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h post-exercise. Results: DC supplementation significantly improved functional performance (CINDY WOD) across all menstrual phases, with the greatest enhancement during PMS (p < 0.01). Reaction time significantly improved during PMS (p = 0.010 vs. control; p = 0.002 vs. placebo). Additionally, DOMS was notably reduced in the luteal phase at 12 h, 24 h, and 72 h post-exercise in the DC condition compared to the control and placebo (p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in HGS across conditions or phases (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Short-term DC supplementation may selectively enhance high-intensity functional performance and cognitive accuracy in trained female athletes, particularly during hormonally sensitive phases such as PMS. Its anti-inflammatory and neuromodulatory properties make DC a promising, non-pharmacological strategy to support female-centric recovery and performance in CrossFit® and similar sports. Future research should explore chronic intake, mechanistic biomarkers, and individual variability across menstrual cycles.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dark chocolate, rich in flavanols, may support vascular health by reducing arterial stiffness and blood pressure across menstrual phases. This study examined the effects of 85% dark chocolate on nitric oxide (NO) levels and vascular function during high-intensity resistance exercise in healthy women across the early follicular and mid-luteal phases. METHODS: Thirty-one healthy women (aged 20-30 years) with regular menstrual cycles completed a randomized, crossover study (conducted at National Chung Cheng University, Sep-Dec 2023). Participants consumed either 85% dark chocolate or milk chocolate (1 g/kg body weight) before high-intensity resistance exercise during the early follicular (days 2-5) and mid-luteal (days 18-24) phases of two menstrual cycles. Finger-toe pulse wave velocity (ftPWV), arterial stiffness, blood pressure, and plasma NO levels were measured at rest, 2 h after chocolate consumption (baseline), immediately post-exercise (T0), and at 60 (T60) and 120 (T120) minutes post-exercise. RESULTS: Dark chocolate supplementation significantly increased NO levels and reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP), ftPWV, and arterial pressure volume index (API) (p < 0.05) compared to milk chocolate across both menstrual phases. During the early follicular phase, dark chocolate also attenuated exercise-induced increases in arterial stiffness and blood pressure (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: 85% dark chocolate supplementation may reduce the negative vascular effects of high-intensity resistance exercise, particularly by lowering blood pressure, arterial stiffness, and API, especially in the early follicular phase. These findings suggest that dark chocolate could be a practical, non-pharmacological intervention for improving cardiovascular health in women. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT06908941.

METHODS: From June 2021 to December 2022, patients with femoropopliteal artery lesions (Rutherford classification 2-6) who underwent DCB combined with Chocolate PTA balloon catheter treatment were included. Clinical data of the patients were collected, and follow-up was conducted at 3, 6, and 12 months. The primary patency rate and the freedom from clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (f-TLR) rate were calculated by Kaplan-Meier survival curves. RESULTS: This study included a total of 43 patients (mean age 72.84 ± 10.19 years, male proportion 67.4%) with 47 lesions. Among them, 17 lesions (36.2%) presented severe stenosis with an average lesion length of 110.41 ± 47.67 mm. Thirty lesions (63.8%) were identified as chronic total occlusions (CTO), with an average occlusion length of 104.13 ± 61.12 mm. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve estimated a primary patency rate of 87.2% at 6 months and 78.7% at 12 months. The f-TLR rate at 12 months was 85.1%, estimated by Kaplan-Meier survival curve. The mean ankle-brachial index (ABI) increased from 0.53 ± 0.12 before the surgery to 0.87 ± 0.12 at 12 months postoperatively, and this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). A total of 91.5% of patients (43/47) showed a decrease in Rutherford classification at 12 months postoperatively. The proportion of patients with Rutherford class 4-6 decreased from 70.2% (33/47) preoperatively to 4.3% (2/47) at 12 months postoperatively, and this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Among the limbs, 34 (72.3%) experienced dissection during the surgery, with 29 cases classified as type B or lower dissection and 5 cases classified as type C or higher (severe dissection) (10.6%). Two limbs (4.3%) required the use of salvage stents. There were no procedure- or device-related deaths within the 12-month period. Twelve limbs (25.5%) underwent minor amputations (toe amputations). CONCLUSION: The combination of DCB and chocolate balloon angioplasty has achieved satisfactory patency rates and f-TLR results in 1-year follow-up for the treatment of femoropopliteal artery lesions. However, further confirmation of these findings is needed through multicenter data and long-term follow-up results."

Patients and methods: This retrospective study was performed with a 12-month follow-up period. The rate of flow-limiting dissection, primary patency, rate and length of bailout stenting, and freedom from major adverse limb events (MALEs) were compared between femoropopliteal lesions treated with plain balloons (PBs) and those treated with Chocolate balloons combined with DCB angioplasty. Results: In total, 192 patients (197 de-novo lesions) were included: 137 patients (141 lesions) in the PB group and 55 patients (56 lesions) in the Chocolate balloon group. The mean total lesion lengths were 126.84±71.57 and 138.39±65.35 mm (P=0.297), more than half of patients had chronic total occlusion (53.2% and 51.8%, P=0.859), the rates of flow-limiting dissection were 15.6% and 12.5% (P=0.579). Rates of primary patency were 88.1% and 92.6%, respectively. Chocolate balloon use reduced the mean total bailout stenting length (135.17±68.85 vs. 98.24±36.78 mm, P=0.022), including in complex lesions (180±70.43 vs. 102.50±44.64 mm, P=0.011), and the absolute bailout stenting length (total bailout stenting/lesion length ratio; 0.74±0.24 vs. 0.48±0.19, P=0.017). Conclusions: Relative to PB, Chocolate balloon use combined with DCB angioplasty did not show a significant advantage. It did, however, reduce the absolute total bailout stenting length in complex lesions."

We here provide a comprehensive literature survey of both, in vitro and in vivo studies including clinical trials summarizing recent evidence on the immune-modulatory effects exerted by application of cocoa-rich dark chocolate or distinct cocoa-derived molecules. The survey revealed that dark chocolate and its derivatives could effectively dampen pro-inflammatory including oxidative stress responses in vascular diseases including atherosclerosis, hypertension, and decompression sickness, metabolic morbidities such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, celiac disease, chronic kidney diseases, and polycystic ovary syndrome, enhance gut epithelial barrier function, and modulate pain sensations. On the other hand, dark chocolate consumption intake was found to worsen acne symptoms. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with dark chocolate with high contents of biologically active polyphenols and methylxanthines might be promising adjunct immune-modulatory treatment options of distinct acute as well as chronic inflammatory morbidities that need to be evaluated in more detail in future in vivo including clinical studies."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the immediate clinical effects of the chocolate balloon and the conventional balloon in endovascular angioplasty of the lower limbs. METHODS: Clinical data were retrospectively collected from a single center, including 117 patients with lower limb arterial lesions treated from January to December 2021 and 112 patients treated from January to December 2023 at our center. The comparison focused on the incidence of vascular dissection after balloon dilatation, with secondary endpoints including the stent implantation rate. RESULTS: In both groups, the success rate was 100%. Dissection formation rates in the chocolate balloon and conventional balloon groups were 20.5% vs. 17.5%, respectively. Non-flow-limiting dissection formation rates were 14.7% vs. 4.8% (P < 0.05), while severe dissection rates were 5.8% vs. 12.7% (P < 0.05). Stent implantation rates were 9.0% in the chocolate balloon group and 18.3% in the conventional balloon group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The use of chocolate balloons resulted in a lower incidence of severe dissection and reduced the stent implantation rate compared to conventional balloons. It effectively prepares complex multiple lesions of lower limb arteries in real-world scenarios."

Dark chocolate is an excellent source of Mg2+. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of 70% cocoa chocolate intake on Mg2+ serum levels in patients with CKD on hemodialysis (HD). METHODS: These are secondary analyses from a previous controlled pilot study. The study included 59 patients undergoing HD. Patients were allocated into 2 groups: dark chocolate and the control group. The dark chocolate group received 40 g of 70% cocoa chocolate for 2 months during HD sessions (3 times a week). The control group did not receive any intervention. Mg2+ was evaluated by a colorimetric test using a commercial kit (Bioclin®). NCT04600258 on March 1, 2020, retrospectively registered. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients in the dark chocolate group (17 women, 53.4 ± 12.9 years) and 11 in the control group (4 women, 46.7 ± 10.9 years) completed the study. The median (interquartile range) overall Mg2+ serum levels were 2.4 (0.4) mg/dL, with no significant differences between the groups. After 2 months of supplementation, serum levels of Mg2+ increased significantly in the dark chocolate group from 2.5 (2.4-2.6) to 2.7 (2.6-2.8) mg/dL (P < .01). No change was observed in potassium and phosphorus plasma levels. CONCLUSIONS: Dark chocolate might be a promising nutritional strategy to improve Mg2+ levels in patients with CKD on HD. The offered dose was safe, not altering plasma phosphorus and potassium levels."

METHODS: This single-center retrospective study included 167 patients with CLTI and infrapopliteal who underwent endovascular intervention with or without chocolate balloons from September 1, 2019 to June 30, 2023. The primary endpoint was amputation-free survival (AFS). Secondary endpoints included major amputation, the absence of clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR), the incidence of flow-limiting dissection, below-the-knee (BTK) stent implantation, change in Rutherford clinical grade, procedural success, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). Patients were followed at 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months to assess symptom improvement, vascular patency as determined by dual-function ultrasound or angiography, and survival. RESULTS: At 12 months, AFS was noted in 78.1% of patients in chocolate balloon group and 70.7% of those in conventional balloon group (p = 0.37). The chocolate balloon group demonstrated a significantly higher rate of CD-TLR absence, with 84.0% compared to 69.4% in the conventional balloon group (p = 0.04). The chocolate balloon group had a major amputation-free rate of 92.8%, slightly better than the 89.5% in the conventional balloon group (p = 0.58). Notably, the chocolate balloon group significantly reduced flow-limiting dissection (p = 0.02) and BTK stent implantation (p = 0.03) compared to the conventional balloon group. CONCLUSION: Chocolate balloon reduces the incidence of flow-limiting dissection and BTK stent implantation in patients with CLTI and infrapopliteal. Compared with conventional balloons, there was less lesion revascularization at 12 months, but no significant benefit was found in improving ASF and reducing major amputation of the affected limb."

      "abstract": "Faba bean is one of the most important grown plants worldwide for human and animal. Despite its various importance, the productivity of faba bean has been constrained by several biotic and abiotic factors. Many faba bean pathogens have been reported so far, of which the most important yield limiting disease is Chocolate Spot Disease (Botrytis fabae). The dynamics of disease transmission and decision-making processes for intervention programs for disease control are now better understood through the use of mathematical modeling. In this paper a deterministic mathematical model for Chocolate Spot disease (CSD) on faba bean plant with an optimal control model was developed and analyzed to examine the best strategy in controlling CSD. The optimal control model is developed with three control interventions, namely prevention ( u 1  ), quarantine ( u 2  ) and chemical control ( u 3  ). The Pontryagin'€™s maximum principle isused to derive the Hamiltonian, the adjoint variables, the characterization of the controls and the optimality system. A cost-effective approach is chosen from a set of possible integrated strategies using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The forward-backward sweep iterative approach is used to run numerical simulations. We obtained the Hamiltonian, the adjoint variables, the characterization of the controls and the optimality system. The numerical results demonstrate that each integrated strategy can reduce the diseases within the specified period. However due to limited resources, an integrated strategy prevention and uprooting was found to be a best cost-effective strategy to combat CSD. Therefore, attention should be given for the integrated cost-effective and environmentally eco-friendly strategy by stake holders and policy makers to control CSD and disseminate the integrated intervention to the farmers in order to fight the spread of CSD in the Faba bean population and produce the expected yield from the field.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The recreational use of psilocybin or psilocin-containing products, a chemical found naturally in certain mushroom species, is on the rise across the United States. Several cases of serious clinical effects related to mushroom-containing products have recently been reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The emergence of these new products and their health consequences are not yet well understood. This case series aims to characterize exposures to mushroom-containing chocolate products, including patient characteristics, clinical effects, treatment(s), and clinical outcome severity, reported to a poison center network. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a retrospective case series conducted in patients exposed to mushroom-containing chocolate products across three poison centers between January 2023 to August 2024. Patients were identified via a database search of ToxSentry®. Patients were included if they were exposed to a mushroom-containing chocolate product. Patients were excluded if they ingested an unrelated product or if there was insufficient information documented within ToxSentry®. The primary endpoint was to describe clinical outcome severity after exposure to mushroom-containing chocolate products. RESULTS: A query of ToxSentry® identified 164 cases; 36 cases met study criteria. The median age of patients in this case series was 17 years old. For most patients (23, 64 %), the reason for the exposure was intentional, with 20 reporting intentional abuse or misuse of the product. Common clinical effects reported included mental status changes (26, 76 %), paranoia/hallucinations (10, 28 %), dysrhythmias (7, 19 %) and gastrointestinal discomfort (6, 17 %). There was one report of seizure. Most clinical effects lasted between 3 and 24 h after ingestion (29, 81 %). Intravenous fluids (18, 50 %) and benzodiazepines (7, 19 %) were the most common treatments given. No fatalities were reported. DISCUSSION: While most patients in this series experienced minor clinical effects, some developed serious effects after ingestion of a mushroom-containing chocolate product.

      "abstract": "Cold temperature (≤20 ᵒC) storage or handling is required to maintain the quality characteristics of chocolate after production throughout the supply chain. The objective of this study was to assess the retail conditions, challenges, and willingness of retailers to use cooling devices. A total of 228 chocolate retailers sampled from Kumasi and Accra were interviewed using questionnaires with both closed and open-ended questions. The purposive, snowballing, and random sampling techniques were used. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS version 26. The majority of the respondents were female (82 %), aged between 21 and 30 years (33.9 %) and had a maximum of Junior High School education (39.0 %). About 15.4 % were registered retailers of Cocoa Processing Company - Ghana, 56.1 % sold on the streets of which 71.1 % sold under no shade and 71.9 % sold all day. A proportion of 76.2 % reported having challenges in their chocolate retail business. Among these challenges softening dominated with about 78.1 % of the retailers reported experiencing it in their daily operations. Spoilage (18.9 %), damage during handling (35.1 %), oily surface (34.2 %), darker surface appearance (10.1 %), and whitish surface appearance (39.9 %) were other challenges faced by retailers. The majority (76.8 %) of the respondents affirmed elevated temperatures caused melting, oil leakage and fat bloom in chocolate leading to rejections by clients. A significant proportion (81.1 %) indicated a cooling device for retail is necessary and were willing to use it when made available. The findings show that vending conditions were generally unsuitable for the shelf-stability of chocolates. An innovative vending device with cooling system would serve as possible intervention to mitigate the challenges faced by chocolate retailers."

This study evaluated the use of dry cleaning methods for removing milk chocolate residue from a butterfly or ball valve attached to a stainless steel pipe and from pilot-scale equipment used in chocolate manufacture. Milk-free dark chocolate (40 °C) was pumped through a milk chocolate-contaminated valve/pipe assembly after no cleaning, use of a pig purging treatment, or a 40 °C cocoa butter flush. Dark chocolate samples were collected at 7-sec intervals. Treatments investigated for the removal of residual milk chocolate from a conche and a ball mill included no cleaning, a 40 °C cocoa butter rinse, and wet cleaning. After cleaning, three batches of dark chocolate (40 °C) were processed in the ball mill and conche, and each batch was collected. Milk chocolate was processed on a 3-roll refiner, followed by push-through with dark chocolate (∼9 kg) with 0.3 kg samples collected at 5-min intervals. Dark chocolate samples were analyzed for milk concentrations by ELISA. Trials and analyses were completed in triplicate. Dark chocolate push-through alone resulted in milk concentrations ≥4,500 µg/g in samples obtained from the contaminated valve/pipe combinations within the first few seconds of collection, and ≥16.2 kg of dark chocolate was needed to obtain milk concentrations below the ELISA LOQ (2.5 µg/g). A pig purging treatment of the ball valve/pipe assembly resulted in milk concentrations below the ELISA LOQ. A cocoa butter flush of the butterfly valve/pipe decreased initial milk concentrations, but milk was detected until ≥18.7 kg dark chocolate purge. Milk concentrations in first batches of dark chocolate processed in a ball mill and conche without cleaning were ≥17,000 µg/g while the use of a cocoa butter rinse reduced milk levels in dark chocolate by ≥89%. Some dry cleaning treatments were effective at reducing levels of milk in dark chocolate due to cross-contact.",

Fecal sampling was performed on the 10th and 100th days and further analyzed for gut microbiota composition, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA), and fecal pH. A significant difference was found in the diversity index, fecal pH, and several microbiotas at the phylum and genus levels. At the phylum level, Bacteroidetes was significantly higher in the probiotic group, and a higher relative abundance (RA) of Firmicutes was found in the placebo group. At the genus level, significant differences were observed in some bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium and Prevotella. Therefore, it can be concluded that the probiotic intervention in this study resulted in changes of gut microbiota diversity and fecal pH.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress and inflammation play critical roles in the pathogenesis of many chronic diseases. Dark chocolate (DC)/cocoa, as a rich source of polyphenols like flavonoids, has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that may confer health benefits, but findings in this context are inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the controlled trials (CTs) that have examined the effects of DC/cocoa on oxidative stress and inflammation biomarkers in adults. SEARCH METHODS: Databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus, were searched for relevant studies through April 2024. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies assessed C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), P-selectin, E-selectin and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in adults were included. DATA ANALYSIS: Based on the random-effects model, we calculated WMDs, SMDs and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Sensitivity, sub-group, meta-regression and dose-response analyses were also conducted. RESULTS: Thirty-three eligible CTs with 1379 participants were included. All studies reported the intervention types (cocoa powder, beverages and chocolate bars) and dosage. However, sixteen studies didn't do/report testing for purity and potency by independent groups. Also, none of the studies mentioned the risk of contamination with heavy metals. Another limitation was the lack of blinding assessment in studies. DC/cocoa significantly reduced MDA (SMD: -0.69, 95 %CI: -1.17, -0.2, p = 0.005) and increased NO levels (SMD: 2.43, 95 %CI: 1.11,3.75, p < 0.001); However, it has no significant effects on the other outcomes. Greater anti-inflammatory effects occurred at higher flavonoid doses (>450 mg/day) and for shorter durations (≤4 weeks) in the non-healthy participants. Non-linear dose-response relationships between cocoa dosage and CRP level and also between flavonoid dosage and IL-6 level were observed. Based on the GRADE evaluation, just CRP and MDA results were considered as high certainty evidence and the other outcomes results were categorized as very low to moderate certainty. CONCLUSIONS: DC/cocoa may improve systemic oxidative status and inflammation in adults. However, further studies should be performed to determine its benefits.",

      "abstract": "The most significant contributor to global mortality are cardiovascular diseases. Dietary factors significantly impact the risk, advancement, and treatment of cardiometabolic conditions. Chocolate, known for its adaptability and capacity to stimulate pleasure centers, emerges as a promising vehicle for integrating different bioactive elements. This systematic review analyzed 10 randomized controlled trials investigating the health effects of consuming enriched, fortified, or supplemented chocolate. These trials varied in chocolate intake amounts (ranging from 5 to 101 g day-1), incorporated bioactive components (co-crystalized astaxanthin, lycopene, wood-based phytosterol-phytostanol mixture, canola sterol esters, etc.), and duration (from 2 weeks to 1 year). Some enriched chocolates were found to reduce total and LDL cholesterol and influence markers of oxidative damage, inflammation, immune function, and skin parameters. However, certain trials showed a minimal impact on health outcomes. Therefore, while enriched chocolate holds promise as a carrier for beneficial bioactive compounds, rigorous scientific inquiry and methodological rigor are crucial to fully substantiate these claims. Comprehensive evaluations covering cardiovascular health, metabolic function, immune response, and other aspects are needed to understand its potential benefits and limitations. Advancing robust research initiatives could help realize the full potential of enriched chocolate in promoting human health and well-being.",

      "abstract": "Intercropping of wheat/faba bean is a common practice within the legume-cereal family. However, the benefits of nitrogen (N) fertilizer-optimized synergistic intercropping in improving faba bean productivity while controlling the prevalence of chocolate spot disease have not been established. This study conducted continuous field experiments spanning two planting seasons to investigate two key findings: (i) Optimizing N fertilizer application can enhance the productivity of intercropped faba bean. (ii) The percentage severity index (PSI) during the period of maximum prevalence rate (Rmax) of faba bean chocolate spot disease poses a substantial challenge to faba bean yield. The results indicated that the land equivalent ratio and transgressive overyielding index for each intercropping treatment increased with higher N fertilizer application, exceeding a value of 1, and the land saving proportion also exceeded 0. Intercropping primarily enhances productivity, as measured by the harvest index (HI), by amplifying the complementary effect rather than the selection effect, thus improving the net benefit of intercropping. The HI of single and intercropped faba bean increased with the N1 and N2 treatments in both planting seasons. However, the HI of single and intercropped faba bean at the N3 level decreased significantly, ranging from 17.85 to 29.62%. Furthermore, a notable negative correlation was established between the PSI during critical epidemic (initial epidemic, maximum epidemic rate, and late epidemic) periods and observed and expected faba bean yields. As the PSI increased, faba bean yields decreased, and the PSI of intercropping at different periods was lower than that observed in the single cropping. Additionally, intercropping with the optimized N fertilizer treatment (N2 treatment) exhibited an enhanced relative control effect on chocolate spot disease in faba bean, ranging from 35.21 to 52.36%. This finding confirmed the productivity advantage of intercropping faba bean. In conclusion, this study suggested that optimizing N fertilizer application can enhance the productivity of intercropped faba bean. Wheat/faba bean intercropping effectively controlled the PSI during the period of Rmax, which would otherwise threaten faba bean yield. Consequently, this practice ensured sustained advantages of wheat/faba bean intercropping.",

The aim of this study was to assess the stabilizing effect of bioemulsifiers/biosurfactants (BE/BS) from two lactobacilli strains in a cold chocolate milk drink. The strains Levilactobacillus brevis S4 and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum S5 isolated from pendidam were screened for their ability to produce BE/BS. The produced BE/BS were characterized, their antimicrobial activities were assessed, and their ability to stabilize cold chocolate milk drinks was determined. The results obtained showed BE/BS yields of 3.48 and 4.37 g/L from L. brevis S4 and L. plantarum S5, respectively. These BE/BS showed emulsifying and surface activities that remained stable after treatment at different temperatures, pH, and salinity. The emulsions formed using BE/BS were stable for 72 h at room temperature (25 ± 1°C). The BE/BS exhibited antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus S1 and Escherichia coli E1. When applied to cold chocolate milk drinks at 0.2% (w/v), the BE/BS from L. brevis S4 and L. plantarum S5 showed interesting solubility indexes and water absorption capacities, which led to the successful stabilization of the drinks. The results of this study demonstrate the stabilizer potential of BE/BS from L. brevis S4 and L. plantarum S5 and suggest their use in the dairy and food industries."

To investigate the causality between dark chocolate intake and the risk of CVDs, a Mendelian randomization (MR) study was conducted. We obtained summary-level data on dark chocolate intake and CVDs from publicly available genome-wide association studies. In this MR study, the main approach was to use a fixed-effect model with inverse variance weighted (IVW) and evaluate the robustness of the results via sensitivity analysis. We found that dark chocolate intake was significantly associated with the reduction of the risk of essential hypertension (EH) (OR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.60-0.88; p = 1.06 × 10-3), as well as with the suggestive association to the reduced risk of venous thromboembolism (OR = 0.69; 95% CI 0.50-0.96; p = 2.81 × 10-2). However, no association was found between dark chocolate intake and the other ten CVDs. Our study provides evidence for a causality between dark chocolate intake and a reduced risk of EH, which has important implications for the prevention of EH in the population.",

The application of shear led to a notable reduction in non-sedimentable proteins, resulting in an increase in the average particle size and apparent viscosity of the dispersions, particularly at high concentrations of k-carrageenan and elevated temperatures. This indicates that shear forces induced prominent protein aggregation, especially at higher κ-carrageenan concentrations. This aggregation was primarily attributed to the destabilisation of micelles and presence of loosely bound caseins within the κ-carrageenan network, which exhibited increased susceptibility to aggregation as collision frequencies increased due to shear."

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In 2020, a 6-month double-blind randomised controlled trial in 75 predementia older people was launched to prevent muscle mass loss, in respond to the 'Joint Programming Initiative A healthy diet for a healthy life'. In the run-in phase, participants will be stabilised on a protein-rich diet (0.9-1.0 g protein/kg ideal body weight/day) and physical exercise programme (high-intensity interval training specifically developed for these subjects). Subsequently, they will be randomised into three groups (1:1:1). The study arms will have a similar isocaloric diet and follow a similar physical exercise programme. Control group (n=25) will maintain the baseline diet; intervention groups will consume either 30 g/day of dark chocolate containing 500 mg total PP (corresponding to 60 mg epicatechin) and 100 mg vitamin E (as RRR-alpha-tocopherol) (n=25); or the high polyphenol chocolate without additional vitamin E (n=25). Muscle mass will be the primary endpoint. Other outcomes are neurocognitive status and previously identified biomolecular indices of frailty in predementia patients. Muscle biopsies will be collected to assess myocyte contraction and mitochondrial metabolism. Blood and plasma samples will be analysed for laboratory endpoints including nutrition metabolism and omics. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: All the ethical and regulatory approvals have been obtained by the ethical committees of the Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata of Verona with respect to scientific content and compliance with applicable research and human subjects' regulation. Given the broader interest of the society toward undernutrition in the elderly, we identify four main target audiences for our research activity: national and local health systems, both internal and external to the project; targeted population (the elderly); general public; and academia. These activities include scientific workshops, public health awareness campaigns, project dedicated website and publication is scientific peer-review journals.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim is to study the disease suppression efficiency, yield loss rate, and yield benefits of intercropped faba bean against chocolate spot under nitrogen (N) input, to clarify the effectiveness of intercropping faba beans in controlling chocolate spot and its contribution to yield increase. RESULTS: Four N input levels and disease suppression treatments were discovered when faba bean-wheat intercropped was used. Adding N enhanced the chocolate spot's area under disease progression curve (AUDPC) by 27.1-69.9%. In contrast to monoculture, intercropping reduced the AUDPC of the chocolate spot by 32.4-51.0% (P < 0.05). Interestingly, the relative control efficacy (RCE) of intercropping at the EShan site was better. With disease suppression or non-suppression, N input increased grain yield loss and its components in faba bean. The total yield advantage effect (TE) and disease-suppression effect (DSE) of faba bean intercropped at the two experimental sites were significantly increased under N input (N1 and N2 level). The proportion of recovery yield due to intercropping suppressed disease (DSE/TE ratio) in EShan (52.1%) was higher than that in Xundian (40.9%), and the DSE of intercropping played an indispensable role in the two sites. Regression analysis of AUDPC and grain yield loss amount showed that one unit increase in chocolate spot AUDPC could cause a grain yield loss of 0.38-0.86 kg ha-1 . The partial land equivalent ratio (pLER) of intercropping faba beans at the EShan site was > 0.33. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, intercropped faba bean with N treatment (45-90 kg ha-1 ) was the best choice for maximizing the intercropping disease control effect. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "Dysmenorrhea, the pain experienced by women during menstruation, affects a significant proportion of women worldwide and often leads to decreased productivity. Various pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments are available for pain relief, but information on their effectiveness, particularly regarding green coconut water, dark chocolate, and Ibuprofen, remains limited. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of green coconut water, dark chocolate bars, and Ibuprofen in reducing the intensity of primary dysmenorrhea. In this research, a randomized controlled trial with a quantitative design was conducted, involving 45 participants randomly assigned to receive 330 mL of green coconut water, 35 g of 70% dark chocolate, or 400 mg Ibuprofen. The interventions were administered on the first day of menstruation when dysmenorrhea symptoms typically occur in subjects. This study used a single-dose approach to evaluate the immediate impact of each treatment. The subjects were instructed to consume the given interventional product within 15 min. The pain intensity was measured using a Numeric Rating Scale before the intervention and 2 h after the subjects finished consuming the interventional product. The multivariate Kruskal-Wallis test revealed a significant difference in effectiveness among the three interventions (p < 0.05). The study found that Ibuprofen was the most effective intervention compared to the other interventions. These findings contribute to understanding the treatment options for primary dysmenorrhea and emphasize the efficacy of Ibuprofen (trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05971186).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Pseudochylothorax is a rare entity, with only a few hundred case reports worldwide. It presents as a pleural effusion rich in lipids, typically with a cloudy, milky appearance. The diagnosis is made based on the levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the pleural fluid. CASE REPORT This is the case report of a 55-year-old woman with a history of pleuropulmonary tuberculosis that was treated in childhood, with a new infection and treatment in adulthood that evolved to a left pleural effusion. Thirteen years after completing her last treatment for tuberculosis, the patient developed general fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. Computed tomography of the chest confirmed the presence of a pleural collection in the same location as in adolescence, suggesting a chronic evolution with encystation. The patient underwent ultrasound-guided diagnostic thoracentesis. The collected liquid was thick, chocolate-colored, with the following biochemical characteristics: pH, 7.3; glucose, 37.9 mg/dL; LDL, 2059.8 IU/L; total protein, 8.8 mg/dL; triglycerides, 90 mg/dL; adenosine deaminase, 56 U/L; and cholesterol, 300 mg/dL. The effusion was characterized as a pseudochylothorax. The cell count showed 631 000 leukocytes/µL, with 87.9% polymorphonuclear cells. Owing to the patient's respiratory symptoms, an evacuatory thoracentesis was performed. After the procedure, the patient's symptoms improved. CONCLUSIONS Although pseudochylothorax is a rare condition, its possibility must always be kept in mind to avoid the hazards of misdiagnosis. In addition to the 'classic' milky and machine oil appearance, a chocolate-colored appearance should also serve as a clue to the diagnosis of pseudochylothorax.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The randomized Chocolate Touch Study demonstrated that in patients undergoing treatment of femoropopliteal artery lesions, the Chocolate Touch drug-coated balloon (DCB) was safe and had superior efficacy at 12 months compared with the Lutonix DCB. We report the prespecified diabetes subanalysis comparing outcomes among patients with and without diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS: Patients with claudication or ischemic rest pain (Rutherford class 2-4) were randomized to Chocolate Touch or Lutonix DCB. The primary efficacy endpoint was DCB success defined as primary patency at 12 months (peak systolic velocity ratio <2.4 by duplex ultrasound without clinically driven target lesion revascularization in the absence of bailout stenting). The primary safety endpoint was freedom from major adverse events at 12 months, a composite of target limb-related death, major amputation, or reintervention. RESULTS: A total of 313 patients (38% DM [n=119]) were randomized to either Chocolate Touch (n=66/152) or Lutonix DCB (n=53/161). Among patients with DM, DCB success was 77.2% and 60.5% (p=0.08), and in non-DM patients, DCB success was 80% and 71.3% (p=0.2114) for the Chocolate Touch and Lutonix DCB, respectively. The primary safety endpoint was similar for both cohorts regardless of DM status (interaction test, p=0.96). CONCLUSIONS: This randomized trial demonstrated similar safety and efficacy for the treatment of femoropopliteal disease with the Chocolate Touch DCB compared with using the Lutonix DCB regardless of DM status at 12 months.Clinical ImpactThis substudy of the Chocolate Touch Study demonstrated similar safety and efficacy for treatment of femoropopliteal disease of the Chocolate Touch DCB compared with the Lutonix DCB regardless of diabetes (DM) status at 12 months. Endovascular therapy has become the therapy of choice for the treatment of most symptomatic femoropopliteal lesions regardless of DM status. These results give clinicians another option when treating femoropopliteal disease in this high-risk patient population.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive function is defined as performance in objective tasks that need conscious mind effort. It has been shown that consuming foods rich in flavanols causes neurobiological effects and improves learning, memory, and global cognitive function. This study aimed to investigate the impact of chronic chocolate consumption on cognitive function in healthy adults based on published trials. The PICO strategy was applied to examine the research question in this study. Researchers searched the Web of Science, Science Direct, Pubmed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases. Related articles of randomized controlled trials that evaluated the chronic effect of chocolate on cognitive function were selected (all published from their inception to February 2021). The difference in means of the last and first measurements was the main effect measure between the control and intervention groups. For quantitative data synthesis, weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were performed in the random effect model. Of the initial 340 articles identified, seven trials met the eligibility criteria. Chronic chocolate intake significantly reduced executive function time (WMD: -11.77, 95% CI: -22.49, -1.05, p = 0.03) of the participants. Further, the language and executive function (WMD: 6.38, 95% CI: 5.97, 6.80, p < 0.001) was raised by 6.38 times after the intervention with chocolate. We could not perform subgroup analysis due to insufficient trials and significant heterogeneity in some studies. It is concluded that daily consumption of cocoa may provide short and middle-term effects on young adults and make them better cognitive performance in learning, memory, and attention.",

      "abstract": "Chocolate agar (CA) is an enriched medium for the isolation and identification of fastidious bacteria. Defibrinated blood is used to manufacture CA, but this expensive product is not always affordable for companies in developing countries. Blood powder (BP) is potentially a cheaper alternative, although its pre-treatment using autoclaving can impair the quality of the media. Therefore, optimization of BP as a substitute for defibrinated blood for CA manufacture deserves further research. CA was manufactured with irradiated BP (dehydrated bovine blood powder) and its physical and microbiological characteristics were compared with those of conventional CA and CA prepared with autoclaved BP. Each medium was seeded with 20-200 CFU of target bacteria using the spiral pouring method. Finally, another medium was prepared using BP pre-treated by grinding and gamma irradiation and its performance assessed. Compared to conventional CA, the medium containing ground and irradiated BP provided a similar CFU count for both fastidious (Neisseria, Haemophilus, Campylobacter, and Streptococcus) and non-fastidious (Moraxella, Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Klebsiella, and Pseudomonas) species, unlike the medium prepared with BP subjected only to irradiation, which provided a lower growth of fastidious species. Morphology and characteristics of all bacterial colonies were very similar in conventional CA and the new medium, the number of Pseudomonas CFU being higher in the latter. The medium prepared with ground plus irradiated vs. irradiated BP more closely resembled conventional CA, having a browner background. The new CA medium prepared with ground and gamma irradiation-sterilized BP has comparable productivity properties to conventional CA. Therefore, it could be a more practical and economical methodology to facilitate large-scale CA manufacture.",

      "abstract": "Plant diseases are biotic stresses that restrict crop plants' ability to develop and produce. Numerous foliar diseases, such as chocolate spots, can cause significant production losses in Vicia faba plants. Certain chemical inducers, including salicylic acid (SA), oxalic acid (OA), nicotinic acid (NA), and benzoic acid (BA), were used in this study to assess efficacy in controlling these diseases. A foliar spray of these phenolic acids was used to manage the impacts of the biotic stress resulting from disease incidence. All tested chemical inducers resulted in a significant decrease in disease severity. They also enhanced the defense system of treated plants through increasing antioxidant enzyme activity (Peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, β-1, 3-glucanase, and chitinase) compared to the corresponding control. Healthy leaves of faba plants recorded the lowest (p < 0.05) values of all antioxidant activities compared to those plants infected by Botrytis fabae. Moreover, the separation of proteins using SDS-PAGE showed slight differences among treatments. Furthermore, foliar spray with natural organic acids reduced the adverse effects of fungal infection by expediting recovery. The SA (5 mM) treatment produced a pronounced increase in the upper, lower epidermis, palisade thickness, spongy tissues, midrib zone, length, and width of vascular bundle. The foliar application with other treatments resulted in a slight increase in the thickness of the examined layers, especially by benzoic acid. In general, all tested chemical inducers could alleviate the adverse effects of the biotic stress on faba bean plants infected by Botrytis fabae."

      "abstract": "The high incidence of aflatoxins (AFs) in chocolates suggests the necessity to create a practical and cost-effective processing strategy for eliminating mycotoxins. The present study aimed to assess the adsorption abilities of activated charcoal (A. charcoal), yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus as AFs adsorbents in three forms-sole, di- and tri-mix-in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) through an in vitro approach, simulated to mimic the conditions present in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) based on pH, time and AFs concentration. In addition, the novel fortification of chocolate with A. charcoal, probiotic, and yeast (tri-mix adsorbents) was evaluated for its effects on the sensory properties. Using HPLC, 60 samples of dark, milk, bitter, couverture, powder, and wafer chocolates were examined for the presence of AFs. Results showed that all the examined samples contained AFs, with maximum concentrations of 2.32, 1.81, and 1.66 µg/kg for powder, milk, and dark chocolates, respectively. The combined treatment demonstrated the highest adsorption efficiency (96.8%) among all tested compounds. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis revealed the tested adsorbents to be effective AF-binding agents. Moreover, the novel combination of tri-mix fortified chocolate had a minor cytotoxicity impact on the adsorptive abilities, with the highest binding at pH 6.8 for 4 h, in addition to inducing an insignificant effect on the sensory attributes of dark chocolate. Tri-mix is thus recommended in the manufacturing of dark chocolate in order to enhance the safety of the newly developed product.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inflammation and oxidative stress lead to a high risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Food rich in polyphenols such as dark chocolate may be an effective strategy to mitigate inflammation and delay CKD complications, outwith sensorial pleasure promotion. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of dark chocolate on inflammation and oxidative stress markers in patients with CKD on hemodialysis (HD). METHODS: A clinical trial was carried out with 59 patients who were allocated into the chocolate group [40g of dark chocolate (70% cocoa) offered during HD sessions, 3×/week] or the control group with any intervention for two months. Plasma levels of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 were evaluated by the ELISA method. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and LDLox levels were evaluated as lipid peroxidation markers. Routine biochemical parameters were analysed using commercial BioClin® kits. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients completed the chocolate group (18 men, 53.0 (16) years and 31.0 (39) months on HD) and 11 in the control group (7 men, 48.0 (17.5) years and 44.0 (56.5) months on HD). Regarding the differences between the groups, the patients who received dark chocolate had reduced plasma levels of TNF-α compared to the control (p = 0.008). No significant changes were observed in the oxidative stress parameters evaluated in both groups. Routine biochemical (including phosphorus and potassium levels) and anthropometric parameters and food intake were not changed after the study period. CONCLUSION: The intervention with dark chocolate (70% cocoa) for two months reduced the plasma levels of TNF-α in patients with CKD on HD. In addition, it is essential to emphasise that chocolate intake did not increase the plasma levels of phosphorus and potassium in these patients. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT04600258.",

Fifteen-day-old larvae were acclimated to different water temperatures (15, 19, 23-control group, 27, and 31 °C) for 60 days prior to the sampling for quantification of mRNA, enzyme, nitric oxide, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Acclimation to 31 °C increased the basal mRNA level of glutathione S-transferase alpha 1 (GSTa1), and activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), and GST enzymes and but downregulated the expression of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) in the whole-body homogenate. Other antioxidant genes, i.e., CAT and GPx1a, were unaffected at 31 °C, and nitric oxide (NO) concentration was significantly lower. In contrast, fish acclimated to 15 °C showed an upregulated transcript level of all the antioxidant genes and no significant difference in the CAT, GR, and GST enzymes. Activities of the metabolic enzymes, aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), were significantly lower at 15 °C. The expression of Hsp47 was upregulated at both 15 and 31 °C groups, whereas Hsp70 was elevated at 27 and 31 °C groups. Wap65-1 transcription did not show significant variation in treatment groups compared to control. Fish in the high (31 °C) and low-temperature (15 °C) acclimation groups were capable of maintaining oxidative stress by modulating their antioxidant transcripts, enzymes, and Hsps.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) describes a group of language-led dementias. PPAs are complex, diverse and difficult to diagnose, and therefore conventional models of aphasia and dementia treatment do not meet their needs. The research evidence on intervention for PPA is developing, but to date there are only a few case studies exploring the experiences of people with PPA (PwPPA) themselves. AIMS: To explore the experiences and opinions of PwPPA and their communication partners (CPs) to understand how speech and language therapy (SLT) services can better meet their needs. METHODS & PROCEDURES: A qualitative research approach was used whereby PwPPA and their friends or family members were recruited to participate in focus groups, via advertisements in the Rare Dementia Support PPA group newsletters. Consenting participants were allocated to attend one of four focus groups hosted on an online video conferencing platform. Participants were asked about their communication difficulties, and how SLT could address these needs. All meetings were transcribed, and data were examined using reflexive thematic analysis. OUTCOMES & RESULTS: Six PwPPA and 14 CPs representing all three PPA variants and mixed PPA participated in the focus groups. Four main themes were identified during the analysis of the focus group discussions: (1) CPs' burden, (2) adjusting to the diagnosis, (3) communication abilities and difficulties and (4) beyond language. A further 10 subthemes were identified. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: This study provides a greater understanding of the experiences and needs of PwPPA and their families in relation to SLT. This work underlines the importance of a person-centred approach that considers the broader needs of both the PwPPA and the people around them. This will enable service providers to deliver SLT that meets the needs of PwPPA and their families and will also inform future research in this field. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: What is already known on this subject We know that PwPPA can maintain or even make improvements in word retrieval and speech fluency with SLT exercises. There is also developing evidence of the benefits of interventions such as CP training, communication aid support and other functional interventions. What this paper adds to existing knowledge This study provides an understanding of the experiences and opinions of people living with PPA and their families in relation to SLT. Results demonstrate that PwPPA and their families have to navigate a complex journey, identifying strategies to support communication but also the influence of personality and other cognitive symptoms. SLT was useful, but not always available. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? This study will enable service providers to better plan, justify funding for and delivery of SLT that will meet the needs of PwPPA and their families. Most importantly this work underlines the importance of a person-centred approach, incorporating the broader needs of the person with PPA and those around them.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the protective effect of dark chocolate (DC) on the letrozole-induced rat model of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). METHODS: In this experimental study, 32 female Wistar rats, weighing (200 ± 20) g, were randomly categorized into 4 groups including control, letrozole (1 mg·kg·d), metformin (500 mg·kg·d) along with letrozole, and DC (500 mg·kg·d) along with letrozole for 28 d by oral gavage. Twenty-four hours after the last supplementation, direct blood sampling was taken from the heart to obtain blood serum for evaluation of sex hormones and gonadotropins, oxidative parameters, inflammatory cytokines, and ovarian tissue was examined for histology. RESULTS: The DC treatment significantly improved PCOS signs, as demonstrated by the significant restoration of ovarian morphology and physiological functions as compared with the letrozole group. DC treatment also decreased ovarian interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α levels and improved total oxidative/antioxidative status as compared with the letrozole group. CONCLUSIONS: Treating the animals with DC could alleviate the PCOS symptoms and reduced the toxic effects of letrozole in the ovary. This effect may mediate through antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To compare the impact of Chocolate and conventional balloons on vessel preparation in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center retrospective study included 111 endovascular therapy consecutive cases of femoropopliteal lesions using drug-coated balloon strategy with a 1:1 pre-dilation balloon diameter between February 2020 and August 2021, divided into the Chocolate percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (n = 48) and conventional (n = 63) groups. Before the availability of Chocolate balloons in Japan (December 2020), a standard semi-compliant or non-compliant balloon was used for vessel preparation. The primary endpoint was rate of severe dissection after pre-dilatation. Secondary endpoints were angiographic percent diameter stenosis, bailout stent rate, primary patency rate, and freedom from target-lesion-revascularization rate at six months. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in patient and lesion characteristics. The procedural characteristics comprised balloon length 90 ± 37 and 149 ± 95 mm (P = 0.004) and inflation pressure 11 ± 3 and 16 ± 7 atm (P < 0.001) in the Chocolate and conventional groups, respectively. Regarding primary endpoint, rates of severe dissection were 4.2% and 25% (P = 0.003); regarding secondary endpoints, percent diameter stenosis was 18 ± 15% and 20 ± 17% (P = 0.409), and the rate of bailout stenting was 2.1% and 15.9% (P = 0.016) in the Chocolate and conventional groups, respectively. The primary patency rates at six months were 89.1% and 85.2% (P = 0.670), and freedom from target-lesion-revascularization rate at six months was 100% and 92.8% (P = 0.691) in the Chocolate and conventional groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: Chocolate percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloons reduce the rate of severe dissection while maintaining a sufficient dilatation effect during drug-coated balloon vessel preparation."

      "abstract": "Cognitive decline is a common problem in older individuals, often exacerbated by neurocognitive conditions, such as vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease, which heavily affect people's lives and exert a substantial toll on healthcare systems. Currently, no cure is available, and commonly used treatments are aimed at limiting the progressive loss of cognitive functions. The absence of effective pharmacological treatments for the cognitive decline has led to the search for lifestyle interventions, such as diet and the use of nutraceuticals that can prevent and limit the loss of cognition. Cocoa and chocolate are foods derived from cocoa beans, commonly used in the population and with good acceptability. The purpose of this review was to collect current experimental evidence regarding the neuroprotective effect of chocolate and cocoa (or derived molecules) in the elderly. From a systematic review of the literature, 9 observational studies and 10 interventional studies were selected, suggesting that the biomolecules contained in cocoa may offer promising tools for managing cognitive decline, if provided in adequate dosages and duration of treatment. However, the molecular mechanisms of cocoa action on the central nervous system are not completely understood."

Our study aimed to show the positive effects of both milk chocolate and dark chocolate on heart failure through endothelial functions. METHODS: Twenty patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction were included in the study. In this randomized, crossover study, some of the patients consumed milk chocolate and some consumed dark chocolate. We recorded the patients' 6-minute walking tests, flow- mediated dilatation values, plasma catechin, epicatechin, and N-terminal pro-brain natri- uretic peptide values before and after chocolate consumption. After 2 weeks, their chocolate consumption was changed. The same parameters were measured again. RESULTS: A significant decrease was observed in N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide values after consumption of both milk chocolate (356 ± 54.2 and 310 ± 72.1 pg/mL; P = .007) and dark chocolate (341 ± 57 and 301 ± 60.1 pg/mL;P=.028). Flow-mediated dilation values increased after dark chocolate consumption (8.9 ± 3% and 14 ± 4.5%; P = .019). CONCLUSION: Chocolate consumption acutely decreases N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic pep- tide values in heart failure. Dark chocolate consumption also seems to improve endothelial functions by increasing flow-mediated dilation values.",

METHODS: The review examined the available literature on caffeine and Parkinson's disease. RESULTS: Caffeine can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and exerts its biological effects mainly by antagonizing adenosine receptors. Numerous studies indicate that caffeine and its derivatives theobromine and theophylline are associated with a reduced risk of Parkinson's disease. Caffeine and adenosine antagonists reduce the excitotoxicity caused by glutamate. Evidence from animal models supports the potential of A2A receptor antagonism as an innovative disease-modifying target in Parkinson's disease CONCLUSION: The present review shows that the investigation and synthesis of xanthine derivatives as well as their analysis in clinical studies could be a promising approach in the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases.",

Dark chocolate fillings were treated at different pressure levels, holding times and stored at 20 °C for 12 months. Unprocessed batches were stored at 4 °C and at -12 °C. Moisture, water activity (aw), pH, colour, G'1Hz and indigenous microflora were measured at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 months of storage. Results showed that 600 MPa/20 min processing was the most effective controlling mesophilic group, presenting 3.8 log cfu/g after 12 months of storage, and inactivating moulds and yeasts after HPP treatment. Colour was affected by storage, including a reduction in the L* parameter in all conditions to final values between 37.8 and 39.3, while the a* parameter increased during storage time at -12 °C and 4 °C to final values of around 12, and parameter b* decreased at storage temperature 20 °C to 5.3. Storage time affected the rheological behaviour of HPP-treated samples, increasing G'1Hz from the 2nd to 12th month of storage time to the final values between 1603 kPa and 2139 kPa. Moisture, aw and pH were not affected by HPP treatment nor storage time."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: First-generation drug-coated balloons (DCBs) have significantly reduced the rate of restenosis compared with balloon angioplasty alone; however, high rates of bailout stenting and dissections persist. The Chocolate Touch DCB is a nitinol constrained balloon designed to reduce acute vessel trauma and inhibit neointima formation and restenosis. METHODS: Patients with claudication or ischemic rest pain (Rutherford class 2-4) and superficial femoral or popliteal disease (≥70% stenosis) were randomized 1:1 to Chocolate Touch or Lutonix DCB at 34 sites in the United States, Europe, and New Zealand. The primary efficacy end point was DCB success, defined as primary patency at 12 months (peak systolic velocity ratio <2.4 by duplex ultrasound without clinically driven target lesion revascularization in the absence of clinically driven bailout stenting). The primary safety end point was freedom from major adverse events at 12 months, a composite of target limb-related death, major amputation, or reintervention. Both primary end points were tested for noninferiority, and if met, sequential superiority testing for efficacy followed by safety was prespecified. An independent clinical events committee, and angiographic and duplex ultrasound core laboratories blinded to treatment allocation reviewed all end points. RESULTS: A total of 313 patients were randomized to Chocolate Touch (n=152) versus Lutonix DCB (n=161). Follow-up at 1 year was available in 94% of patients. The mean age was 69.4±9.5 years, the average lesion length was 78.1±46.9 mm, and 46.2% had moderate-to-severe calcification. The primary efficacy rates of DCB success at 12 months was 78.8% (108/137) with Chocolate Touch and 67.7% (88/130) with Lutonix DCB (difference, 11.1% [95% CI, 0.6-21.7]), meeting noninferiority (Pnoninferiority<0.0001) and sequential superiority (Psuperiority=0.04). The primary safety event rate was 88.9% (128/144) with Chocolate Touch and 84.6% (126/149) with Lutonix DCB (Pnoninferiority<0.001; Psuperiority=0.27). CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective, multicenter, randomized trial, the second-generation Chocolate Touch DCB met both noninferiority end points for efficacy and safety and was more effective than Lutonix DCB at 12 months for the treatment of femoropopliteal disease.

Seven female badminton players (23 ± 1 years; height: 163.8 ± 4.1 cm; body mass: 58.7 ± 0.9 kg) were randomly assigned to 1 week of LFCM (500 mL) or placebo (water, 500 mL) consumption in a crossover design. Participants consumed LFCM or water immediately after each training session during the 1-week intervention. Performance variables (aerobic power, anaerobic power, agility, explosive power, and maximum handgrip strength) were assessed at two separate time points: pre and post-intervention (after 1 week). In addition, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to assess DOMS before, immediately after, and at 24 and 48 h after each training session. There were significant time effects for aerobic power, upper body explosive power, minimum anaerobic power, and time to exhaustion (TTE), which significantly increased after LFCM consumption (p < 0.05). Moreover, relative and maximum lower body power significantly (p < 0.05) increased, while rating of perceived exertion (RPE) as well as DOMS in lower extremity muscles immediately after exercise significantly decreased after LFCM consumption compared to placebo (p < 0.05). There were no significant changes in maximum anaerobic power, agility, and maximum handgrip strength (p > 0.05). LFCM, as a post-exercise beverage, may help speed recovery in female badminton players leading to increased aerobic, anaerobic, and strength performance indices, increased TTE, and decreased muscle soreness and RPE.",

The response variables included blood pressure, anthropometric indices, lipid profile, and inflammatory and oxidative stress indices. Statistical analyses were performed using the Pkcross procedure, and Cohen's d was estimated for all response variables. There was no significant inter-period difference between the mean changes of body weight, waist circumference, and body mass index (BMI). Furthermore, no significant change was confirmed in participants' blood pressure, triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), serum homocysteine, high-sensitive c-reactive protein (hs-CRP), malondialdehyde (MDA), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Older advanced stage cancer patients, with changes in nutritional status, represent an important demand for palliative care. The aim was to determine the effects of 4 weeks of chocolate consumption on the nutritional status of older cancer patients in palliative care. METHODS: Older cancer patients in palliative care with ambulatory (n = 46) monitoring were randomized to control (CG, n = 15), intervention with 55% cocoa chocolate (IG1, n = 16) and intervention with white chocolate (IG2, n = 15) groups and evaluated before and after 4 weeks for nutritional status (primary outcome), evaluated by the Mini Nutritional Assessment tool (MNA). Food consumption, anthropometry, body composition, laboratory parameters and quality of life (QL) with the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer instrument were also evaluated. RESULTS: IG1 progressed with increased screening (estimated difference [95% CI]: - 1.3 [- 2.2;-0.4], p < 0.01), and nutritional (estimated difference [95% CI]: - 1.3 [- 2.5;-0.1], p = 0.04) scores on the MNA, with no change in anthropometry and body composition. Regarding antioxidant capacity, reduced glutathione levels increased (estimated difference [95% CI]: - 0.8 [- 1.6;-0.02], p = 0.04) and malondealdehyde levels decreased in IG2 (estimated difference [95% CI]:+ 4.9 [+ 0.7;+ 9.1], p = 0.02). Regarding QL, functionality improved in IG1, with higher score in the functional domain (estimated difference [95% CI]:-7.0 [- 13.3;-0.7], p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The consumption of chocolate with a greater cocoa content may contribute to the improvement of the nutritional status and functionality among older cancer patients in palliative care. The consumption of white chocolate was associated with improved oxidative stress. TRIAL REGISTRATION: A randomized clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04367493 ).",

      "abstract": "The consumption of food for pleasure is mainly associated with adverse health effects. This review was carried out to verify recent reports on the impact of chocolate and wine consumption on cardiovascular health, with a particular focus on atherosclerosis. On one side, these products have proven adverse effects on the cardiovascular system, but on the other hand, if consumed in optimal amounts, they have cardiovascular benefits. The submitted data suggest that the beneficial doses are 30-50 g and 130/250 mL for chocolate and wine, respectively, for women and men. The accumulated evidence indicates that the active ingredients in the products under consideration in this review are phenolic compounds, characterized by anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiplatelet properties. However, there are also some reports of cardioprotective properties of other compounds such as esters, amines, biogenic amines, amino acids, fatty acids, mineral ingredients, and vitamins. Our narrative review has shown that in meta-analyses of intervention studies, consumption of chocolate and wine was positively associated with the beneficial outcomes associated with the cardiovascular system. In contrast, the assessment with the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) scale did not confirm this phenomenon. In addition, mechanisms of action of bioactive compounds present in chocolate and wine depend on some factors, such as age, sex, body weight, and the presence of additional medical conditions. Patients using cardiovascular drugs simultaneously with both products should be alert to the risk of pharmacologically relevant interactions during their use. Our narrative review leads to the conclusion that there is abundant evidence to prove the beneficial impact of consuming both products on cardiovascular health, however some evidence still remains controversial. Many authors of studies included in this review postulated that well-designed, longitudinal studies should be performed to determine the effects of these products and their components on atherosclerosis and other CVD (Cardiovascular Disease) disease.",

      "abstract": "Research has shown that both dark chocolate and exercise training may have favorable effects on antioxidant function in obese cohorts. However, their combined effect has not been established. We assessed the influences of six weeks of dark chocolate consumption combined with jump rope exercise on antioxidant markers in adolescent boys with obesity. Fifty adolescent boys with obesity (age = 15 ± 1 years) were randomly assigned into one of four groups; jump rope exercise + white chocolate consumption (JW; n = 13), jump rope exercise + dark chocolate consumption (JD; n = 13), dark chocolate consumption (DC; n = 12), or control (C; n = 12). Two participants dropped out of the study. Participants in JW and JD groups performed jump rope exercise three times per week for six weeks. Participants in the DC and JD groups consumed 30 g of dark chocolate containing 83% of cocoa during the same period. Serum concentrations of superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were evaluated prior to and after the interventions. All 3 intervention groups noted significant (p < 0.01) increases in serum concentrations of TAC, SOD, and GPx from baseline to post-test. In contrast, all intervention groups showed significantly reduced serum concentrations of TBARS from pre- to post-test (p ≤ 0.01). Bonferroni post hoc analysis revealed that post-test serum concentrations of TAC in the JD group were significantly greater than C (p < 0.001), DC (p = 0.010), and JW (p < 0.001) groups. In addition, post-test serum concentrations of SOD in the JD group were significantly greater than C group (p = 0.001). Post-test serum concentrations of GPx in the JD group were significantly greater than C (p < 0.001), DC (p = 0.021), and JW (p = 0.032) groups. The post-test serum concentrations of TBARS in the JD group was significantly lower than C (p < 0.001). No other significant between-group differences were observed. The current study provides evidence that dark chocolate consumption in combination with jump rope exercise is more efficient in improving antioxidant capacity than dark chocolate consumption or jump rope exercise alone among obese adolescent boys."

The present study was designed to investigate the effect of an SS-enriched extract fraction of B. falcatum roots on operant, oral self-administration of alcohol and chocolate in rats. To this end, female Sardinian alcohol-preferring and Wistar rats were trained to lever-respond for alcohol (15% v/v) and chocolate (5% w/v powdered Nesquik in water), respectively. Acute treatment with B. falcatum extract (0, 0.75, 1.5, and 3 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced, in a dose-related manner, both alcohol and chocolate self-administration. These data confirm the notion that B. falcatum extracts may be a valuable source of pharmacological agents with anti-addictive and anorectic potential. The use of experimental procedures with predictive validity for the human disease adds strength to the translational potential of these results.",

AIMS: In this study, the objective was to measure the efficacy of the ginger-honey-chocolate mixture as the remineralization effect has been shown in the literature previously and to evaluate the individual contributions of this mixture; ginger, natural honey, bitter chocolate separately on remineralization of initial enamel caries lesion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All specimens were divided into eight groups as: Ginger (Arifoglu®, Turkey) in powder form, (n = 8); Ginger-Honey-Chocolate (n = 8); Natural honey (Balparmak Plateau Blossom Honey®, Turkey) (n = 9); Bitter chocolate (Nestlé®, Switzerland) (n = 8); MI Paste (GC, Japan) (n = 8); Paradontax (Sensodyne, Glaxosmithklein, USA) (n = 9); Pronamel (Sensodyne, Glaxosmithklein, USA) (n = 9); Control (n = 9) groups. Samples were carried out five pH cycles along 7 days at 37°C for each group. During pH cycling, blocks were put in a demineralization (6 h) and a remineralization solution (18 h). The treatment consisted of 1 min. interaction of enamel surfaces with agent/deionized slurries (1:3 w/w) on a daily basis. The surface microhardness (SMH) was determined before and after pH cycling with a Digital Micro-Vickers Hardness Tester (Wilson Wolpert; Europe BV, 401 MVD, Netherlands). Mineral changes were determined by using FluoreCam® and recovery values were calculated as SMHR% and FΔ%, respectively. RESULTS: All groups showed an enhanced remineralization. There was no significant difference in terms of FΔ% (F = 1.223, P = 0.304) and SMHR% (F = 0.709, P = 0.664) between all groups. CONCLUSION: The herbals (ginger, honey, and bitter chocolate) examined in this study gave promising results with a high remineralization potential.",

METHODS: Seventy patients were randomly divided into an observation group and a control group, 35 cases in each group. The patients in the the control group were treated with oral administration of mifepristone, 10 mg each time, once a day; based on the treatment of the control group, the patients in the observation group were treated with thunder-fire moxibustion at Guanyuan (CV 4), Zigong (EX-CA 1), Xuehai (SP 10), once every other day. Both the groups were treated for 3 months. The Cox menstrual symptom scale (CMSS) score, the maximum cross-sectional area of ectopic cyst, and the serum levels of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and interleukin-17 (IL-17) were observed before and after treatment in the two groups. The clinical efficacy was evaluated. RESULTS: Compared before treatment, the severity scores and duration scores of CMSS as well as the serum levels of TGF-β1 were reduced after treatment in the two groups (P<0.05), and the serum level of IL-17 in the observation group was reduced (P<0.05); the reducing of the severity score and duration score of CMSS as well as the serum levels of TGF-β1 and IL-17 in the observation group were more significant than those in the control group (P<0.05). After treatment, the maximum cross-sectional area of ectopic cyst in the two groups was decreased (P<0.05), and the reducing in the observation group was more significant than that in the control group (P<0.05). The total effective rate was 94.3% (33/35) in the observation group, which was higher than 71.4% (25/35) in the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Thunder-fire moxibustion combined with mifepristone could significantly improve dysmenorrhea symptoms, shorten dysmenorrhea time and promote atrophy of ovarian heterotopic cyst in patients with ovarian chocolate cyst dysmenorrhea of kidney deficiency and blood stasis, and the mechanism may be related to the reduction of serum levels of TGF-β1 and IL-17.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of clinical signs, clinical pathological findings, therapy and outcome of 156 dogs after chocolate ingestion. The concentration of methylxanthines (theobromine, caffeine) was calculated based on the type of chocolate and the amount ingested. RESULTS: One hundred and twelve dogs had no clinical signs. Forty-four dogs had clinical signs of chocolate intoxication. Twenty-eight of these 44 dogs ingested dark and bitter chocolate. Reasons for presentation were agitation (33), tremor (22), vomiting (21), panting (11), polyuria/polydipsia (seven) and diarrhea (two). Common clinical findings were sinus tachycardia (28), tachypnea/panting (14), hyperthermia (10) and dehydration (seven). Clinical pathological findings in 34 of 44 dogs consisted of hyperlactataemia (23), hypokalaemia (16), mild hyperglycaemia (16) and mild alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation (14). After decontamination (apomorphine, activated carbon) and symptomatic treatment (fluid therapy, esmolol, forced diuresis, sedatives), 43 of the 44 dogs survived. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: In dogs with potential chocolate intoxication, the type and amount of chocolate and the time of ingestion are important factors. Cardiovascular, neurological and gastrointestinal signs are the most common clinical signs. In this case series, the prognosis after decontamination and symptomatic therapy was good, with a mortality rate of less than 3%.",

This context investigated the characteristics and suitability of utilizing cocoa shell (CS), an agro-industrial residual biomass waste from the chocolate industry, without any chemical and/or physical treatment. It is an abundant, low-cost, and green adsorbent that can be utilized for the effective removal of basic blue (BB41) as an example of cationic dye from aqueous solutions. The CS showed high adsorption potential (90.04%) with the mild operating condition, 45 min adsorption time, pH 6, CS dose 4 g/L, BB41 concentration 10 mg/L, stirring speed 400 rpm at 295 K. The kinetic, equilibrium, isotherms and mechanism studies revealed that the BB41 adsorption onto CS was attained mainly by electrostatic interaction, π-π stacking interaction, hydrogen bonding, covalent bond, and physical mechanisms. Besides, the organic functional groups played an important role during the adsorption process. The thermodynamic parameters suggested that the adsorption of BB41 dye was the non-spontaneous endothermic process with an activation energy 18.28 kJ/mol. From the industrial point of view, this work offers an economical push in waste management and also a green approach for the effective removal of toxic dyes from textile wastewater."

For primary analysis, subjects were divided into two groups: non-consumer (n = 3,741, 53.6%); consumer (n = 3,241, 46.4%). In order to investigate dose-response effects on MetS, chocolate consumers were divided into quartiles based on amounts consumed: Q1 (n = 789, 24.3%); Q2 (n = 837, 25.8%); Q3 (n = 863, 26.6%); Q4 (n = 752, 23.2%) in second analysis. RESULTS: Chocolate consumers; 1) were more physically active(P < 0.0001); 2) less likely to smoke(P < 0.0001); 3) paid more attention to food nutrition labels (P < 0.0001), and 4) had healthier dietary patterns, that is, they consumed vegetables, fruits, and dairy products more frequently(P < 0.0001) than non-consumers. Furthermore, chocolate consumers had a 30% lower risk of MetS (odds ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-0.86; P = 0.0005). However, dose-response effects between chocolate intake and MetS was not found by secondary analysis after excluding non-consumers. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, chocolate consumers had healthier lifestyles and dietary patterns and a lower prevalence of MetS than non-consumers, as determined by our primary analysis. Although dose-response effects were not found to be significant among chocolate consumers during secondary analysis, the patterns were partially similar. This cross-sectional finding shows chocolate consumption does not increase the risk of MetS. The prospective studies and intervention trials in Korea are needed to confirm this cross-sectional finding."

      "abstract": "In this work, an effective and simple method is proposed for the simultaneous determination of cadmium, lead and copper in chocolate samples by Square Wave Anodic Stripping Voltammetry (SWASV). An ultrasonic bath was used for the extraction of cadmium, lead and copper from fourteen chocolate samples using HNO3 solution (7 mol L-1). The electrochemical system consisted of a cell with three electrodes and HCl solution (10 mmol L-1) as the supporting electrolyte. An efficient extraction of the metals (~100%) was attained after 1 h of ultrasonic pre-treatment. Quantitative analysis was carried out by the standard addition method. Good linearity, precision and accuracy were obtained in the range of concentrations examined. The accuracy was evaluated by means of a reference sample of spiked skim milk powder (BCR 151) to prove the reliability of the method. Detection limits (LOD) of 0.089, 0.059 and 0.018 µg g-1 were found for cadmium, copper and lead, respectively, in the chocolate samples. Concentrations in chocolate samples were 4.30-138 µg g-1 for Cu and 0.83-27.9 µg g-1 for Pb, with no significant Cd. The simultaneous determination brings advantages to other methods already reported for chocolate analysis and the samples preparation proposed avoids the traditional sample mineralization step. These characteristics show this new method is especially attractive for case studies and routine analysis.",

In the single-intake experiment, the plasma concentrations of ECg (P < 0.05, at 1.5 h) and EGCg (P < 0.05, at 6 h) but not those of EC and EGC were reduced by the chocolate matrix. Regardless of the chocolate matrix, ECg and EGCg were mainly present as their aglycones in the plasma, whereas EGC and EC were found mostly as conjugated metabolites. After daily intake of GTCs mixed with chocolate for 14 days followed by overnight fasting, ECg but not EGCg was detected in the plasma. To compare the plasma profiles of ECg and EGCg, a mixture containing approximately equal amounts of ECg and EGCg was administered to nine rats for 14 days. Following treatment and overnight food deprivation, the plasma content of ECg was higher than that of EGCg. After a single injection of the same mixture in seven rats, ECg levels were higher than those of EGCg, and a greater amount of conjugated metabolites of ECg than those of EGCg was detected in the plasma 10 h after administration. In conclusion, the chocolate matrix affects the plasma profiles of GTCs, particularly ECg. ECg appears to persist in the plasma for a longer period, regardless of the chocolate matrix.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It is postulated that cocoa solids possess cardioprotective capacity by various mechanisms. In the different cocoa studies evaluating cardiovascular disease, there are no conclusive data on the role it plays in controlling the lipid profile and anthropometric variables, perhaps because the concentration of cocoa, the geographical origin of the population, and the different concentrations supplied lead to a high heterogeneity of results. This study aims to estimate the effect of consuming cocoa-rich chocolate compared to placebo on the lipid profile and anthropometric variables based on data from three clinical trials conducted in Colombia. METHODS: Meta-analysis of individual data from three randomized clinical trials conducted in Colombia. The entire population of the primary studies was included, which was reassigned into intervention groups if they consumed 50 grams of 70% concentrated cocoa or placebo, which was considered to be cocoa-free or with a concentration less than 50 grams. The variables at the beginning of the study were analyzed with medians, interquartile ranges, means, and deviations according to whether they met the normality assumption. Multiple imputations were used to manage missing data and were analyzed using the two approaches proposed for this type of study, that of one and two stages. In the two-stage approach, the data were weighted on a conventional Forrest plot, while in the one-stage approach, linear regressions with mixed models were applied. This study is governed by the regulations described in the 2013 Declaration of Helsinki and by article 11 of Resolution 8430 of 1993, which classifies it as a risk-free study. RESULTS: A total of 275 participants were included, who consumed cocoa or placebo for 81 days on average; 52.7% were female and few smoked at the time of the intervention (31/275). Physical activity performed in number of hours per week was comparable between the intervention groups. When evaluating total cholesterol, low-density cholesterol (LDL), high-density cholesterol (HDL), triglycerides, abdominal circumference, and final body mass index with both the one-stage and two-stage approaches, there were no significant differences between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: According to the results obtained in the meta-analysis, the consumption of cocoa in the Colombian population does not seem to significantly modify variables such as lipid profile, abdominal circumference, and body mass index. This conclusion according to the quality of the evidence has a weak recommendation and a low-to-moderate certainty. However, the analysis through the two proposed approaches yielded similar results."

      "abstract": "Chocolate, one of the most popular sweets in the world, is consumed by people of all ages. Available data point to significant increases in consumption and production. However, successful determination of elements in chocolate is still difficult because of the characteristics of the matrix which contains a high content of organic compounds, like hydrogenated vegetable oil, vegetable fats, solids from malt extract, salts, emulsifiers, etc., causing problems with appropriate decomposition or digestion of sample. In this study, chocolate samples were prepared according to two procedures: water bath and microwave-assisted mineralisation. The use of Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) allowed us to determine the elemental composition of dark, milk, and white chocolate bars available on the Polish market as well as a cacao sample (100% cocoa powder). The elements assessed were Al, Ba, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, P, S, Sr, and Zn. The obtained results were used to compare the effectiveness of sample pre-treatment methods and to assess the correlation between the concentrations of specific elements and type of chocolate by the application of chemometric and statistical tools. The research showed that levels of analysed macro- and microelements are directly connected with the type of chocolate, characterised by the variable contents of cocoa paste and added milk. Data for all samples after mineralisation shown that among macroelements P was the most abundant, followed by Mg, Ca, Na, K, and S. The major essential element with the highest level was Fe, followed by Zn and Cu. In the group of toxic metals the highest content was obtained for Ba, then Al and Sr, but none exceeded permissible values prepared by health benefit organisations.",

      "abstract": "Obesity remains a major public health problem due to its increasing prevalence. Natural products have become common as adjunct therapeutic agents for treating obesity and preventing metabolic diseases. Cocoa and its products are commonly consumed worldwide. Dark chocolate, a rich source of polyphenols, has received attention lately for its beneficial role in the management of obesity; however, conflicting results are still being reported. This scoping review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the existing literature on the relationship and effects of cocoa and dark chocolate intake among obese adults. We searched multiple databases for research investigating the consumption of cocoa and/or dark chocolate in managing obesity among adults. This review includes epidemiological and human studies that were published in English over the last 10 years. Our review of the current literature indicates that epidemiological and human trials with obese adults have shown inconsistent results, which may be due to the different populations of subjects, and different types of cocoa products and doses used for intervention. Studies among obese adults are mainly focusing on obese individuals with comorbidities, as such more studies are needed to elucidate the role of cocoa polyphenols in weight control and preventing the risk of chronic diseases among obese individuals without comorbidities as well as healthy individuals. Careful adjustment of confounding factors would be required. The effects of cocoa and dark chocolate intake on obese adults were discussed, and further research is warranted to identify the gaps.",

METHODS: Following a randomised controlled parallel clinical trial, a total of 140 postmenopausal women aged 50-64 were recruited. The intervention group (n = 73) consumed daily 10 g of chocolate (99% cocoa) in addition to their usual food intake for 6 months, whereas the control group (n = 67) did not receive any intervention. Attention and executive functions, verbal memory, working memory, phonological fluency, category fluency and clinical variables were assessed at baseline and 6 months. RESULTS: Trail Making Test B execution time showed a decreased of -12.08 s (95% CI: -23.99, -0.18; p = 0.047) in the intervention group compared to the control group, after adjusting for age, educational level, time elapsed from the beginning of menopause and daily energy consumption (Cohen's d = -0.343). Attention, immediate or delayed verbal memory, phonological or category fluency, and working memory remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: The consumption of cocoa-rich (99%) chocolate in addition to the habitual diet could be related to a slight improvement in cognitive performance regarding cognitive flexibility and processing speed in postmenopausal women, with no changes in the rest of the cognitive performance variables evaluated.Trial registration: This clinical trial has been registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03492983.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High blood pressure (BP) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Consumption of dark chocolate, which is high in flavonoids that may reduce CVD risk, is an attractive intervention to reduce to BP. Additionally, the use of mobile health (mHealth) technologies (eg, telehealth, smartphones, and wearable devices) can improve outcomes in patients with CVD. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of dark chocolate intake on BP, subject use of mHealth, and integration of mHealth into a clinical trial. METHODS: The COCOA-BP (ChOcolate COnsumption And Blood Pressure) study was a prospective, single-center, pre-/postintervention study that enrolled 62 healthy volunteers. The study consisted of 3 phases: smartwatch/smart BP monitor familiarization and washout from chocolate (week 1); control (week 2); and intervention (weeks 3 and 4). During the intervention phase, subjects consumed 50 g of dark chocolate per day. The primary endpoint was change in resting systolic BP between the intervention and control phases. Additional endpoints included device accuracy and correlation with physical activity. RESULTS: Mean resting systolic BP was 116.4 mm Hg before chocolate intake among 62 participants (mean age 37 years; 61% female). After chocolate intake, mean resting systolic BP was 116.0 mm Hg (difference -0.4; P = .69). These findings suggest that 2 weeks of dark chocolate intake did not reduce resting systolic BP. There was poor agreement between mHealth device and standard (nurse-performed) measurements. CONCLUSION: In this study, short-term dark chocolate intake did not seem to reduce BP. mHealth technology shows great potential for use in clinical studies, but challenges related to device accuracy and compliance need to be addressed."

Forty-eight obese adolescent boys (age  = 15.4  ±  1.1 years and body mass index  =  32.2  ±  2.4 kg/m2) were randomly assigned into one of four groups: JRE + white chocolate (JW; n = 13), JRE + dark chocolate supplementation (JD; n = 13), dark chocolate supplementation (DS; n = 12), or control (C; n = 12). Participants in JW and JD groups performed JRE for three times per week for six weeks. Participants in the DS and JD groups consumed 30 g of dark chocolate containing 83% of cocoa. Body composition, pro-inflammatory cytokines ((hs-CRP, TNF-α, IL-6), adipokines (leptin, resistin, RBP-4, chemerin, MCP-1), and anti-inflammatory adipokines (irisin, adiponectin)) were evaluated prior to and after the intervention trials. All three intervention trials significantly (p < 0.05) decreased body mass, waist-hip ratio, fat mass, hs-CRP, TNF-α, IL-6, leptin, resistin, RBP-4, and MCP-1, and increased irisin and adiponectin concentrations. The improvements in these parameters were greater in the JD group, and additionally, chemerin concentrations decreased only in the JD group. JD enhanced adiponectin concentrations and decreased IL-6 concentrations compared to C. Moreover, JD significantly reduced chemerin concentrations, an effect not observed in any of the other interventions. We demonstrated that dark chocolate supplementation potentiated JRE-induced decreases in body mass, WHR, FM, hs-CRP, TNF-α, IL-6, leptin, resistin, RBP-4, and MCP-1, chemerin as well as increases irisin and adiponectin concentrations in obese adolescent boys. Therefore, JRE combined with dark chocolate supplementation could be a beneficial in reducing obesity-induced inflammation in adolescent boys.",

The aim of the present study was to analyse the effect on QoL of adding 10 g per day of chocolate with a high concentration of cocoa (99%) to the habitual diet, for 6 months, in a sample of postmenopausal women. Postmenopausal women (n = 140) aged 50-64 years were randomised to either an addition of 10 g per day of cocoa-rich chocolate to their usual diet or no supplement addition. All variables were measured at baseline and after six months of intervention. QoL was evaluated using the 3-level version of EuroQol-5D (EuroQoL-5D-3L), the EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) and the Cervantes scale. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) analyses adjusted for the main determinants of QoL considered in this study showed no changes in the global score of QoL evaluated with the EuroQoL-5D-3L. The intervention group showed an increase of 6.0 points (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.4, 11.7) in the EQ-VAS compared to the control group (p = 0.036). No significant changes were observed between groups in the global score of QoL nor in the dimensions and subdimensions measured with the Cervantes scale. The additional daily contribution of 10 g of cocoa-rich chocolate in postmenopausal women could have a slight impact on their perception toward their health state, although without modifying the health-related QoL or the dimensions that compose it.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To investigate the separate and combined effects of a single session of high intensity interval training (HIIT) and chocolate milk on appetite and cognitive performance in youth aged 9-13 years. Blood glucose, salivary cortisol, and subjective emotions were measured to evaluate potential underlying mechanisms contributing to changes in appetite and cognitive performance. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Using a 2 × 2 repeated measures design, 20 youth (n = 12 girls and n = 8 boys; age = 11.4 ± 0.3 years) performed HIIT on a cycle ergometer (7 × 60 s bouts, interspersed by 60 s active recovery) or sitting, followed by consumption of 163 kcal chocolate milk or water. Capillary blood glucose, salivary cortisol, cognitive performance, and subjective appetite and emotions were assessed at baseline and at several time points post-treatment. RESULTS: Subjective appetite decreased from baseline following chocolate milk consumption compared water (p = 0.04), and increased from baseline after HIIT compared to sitting (p = 0.01). Participants recalled more words during a short-term memory task and had faster reaction times during an attention task following HIIT compared to sitting (Δ = 1.1 ± 0.02 words, p = 0.03; and Δ = 117.9 ± 23.1 ms, p = 0.01, respectively). Blood glucose increased from baseline following chocolate milk consumption compared to water (at 10 min: Δ = 1.0 ± 0.33 vs. Δ = 0.29 ± 0.060 mmol/L; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings that HIIT may have a positive effect on aspects of cognitive performance suggest that youth should engage in HIIT-like exercise during recesses and lunch at school to attenuate declines in cognitive performance throughout the day.

This study was designed to investigate the effect of adding 10 g of cocoa-rich chocolate to the habitual diet of postmenopausal women daily on body composition. We conducted a 6-month, two-arm randomised, controlled trial. Postmenopausal women (57·2 (sd 3·6) years, n 132) were recruited in primary care clinics. Participants in the control group (CG) did not receive any intervention. Those of the intervention group (IG) received 10 g daily of 99 % cocoa chocolate in addition to their habitual diet for 6 months. This quantity comprises 247 kJ (59 kcal) and 65·4 mg of polyphenols. The primary outcomes were the between-group differences in body composition variables, measured by impendancemetry at the end of the study. The main effect of the intervention showed a favourable reduction in the IG with respect to the CG in body fat mass (-0·63 kg (95 % CI -1·15, -0·11), P = 0·019; Cohen's d = -0·450) and body fat percentage (-0·79 % (95 % CI -1·31, -0·26), P = 0·004; Cohen's d = -0·539). A non-significant decrease was also observed in BMI (-0·20 kg/m2 (95 % CI -0·44, 0·03), P = 0·092; Cohen's d = -0·345). Both the body fat mass and the body fat percentage showed a decrease in the IG for the three body segments analysed (trunk, arms and legs). Daily addition of 10 g of cocoa-rich chocolate to the habitual diet of postmenopausal women reduces their body fat mass and body fat percentage without modifying their weight.",

Two hundred grams of cocoa cake was treated with different amounts of natron (0 g, 0.961 g; 1.082 g; 1.202 g; 1.322 g; and 1.442 g). Sensory analyzes were performed on each natron-treated cake. Three ranges of chocolates (black chocolate, milk chocolate, and spread chocolate) were formulated with three cakes (cake with 0 g, 1.202 g and 1.442 g of natron). The nutritive value of the most preferred chocolates was determined by standard Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) methods. Results showed that natron significantly reduces the bitterness of cocoa cake (p ˂ .05). The natron treatment significantly improves the taste and overall acceptability (p ˂ .05) of all chocolate ranges. The most appreciated chocolates are those containing 1.442 g; 0 g and 1.202 g of natron, respectively, for black, milk and spread chocolate. Natron significantly decreased (p < .05) the phenolic composition of milk and spread chocolate as well as the moisture, lipid, ash, and energy content. Nevertheless, it significantly increases (p < .05) the levels of carbohydrates and fiber. The treatment with 1.202 g and 1.442 g of natron significantly increases (p ˂ .05) the sodium and iron content of all ranges of chocolates. For the black chocolate range, treatment with 1.442 g of natron significantly increases (p < .05) the levels of sodium, iron, zinc, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, manganese and potassium. Natron treatments improve taste, overall acceptability, and sodium and iron contents of chocolate ranges."

      "abstract": "Two decontamination methods were evaluated for inactivating a cocktail of Salmonella or Listeria monocytogenes inoculated onto model low moisture foods (LMFs; dried strawberry, dried apple, raisins, chocolate crumb, cornflakes, shell-on or deshelled pistachio nuts). One treatment was based on a peracetic acid-ethanol (PAA-ethanol) sanitizer combination with the other being an Advanced Oxidation Process (AOP) that simultaneously applied UV-C (254 nm), ozone and hydrogen peroxide. The low moisture food was spray inoculated then dried prior to treatment. With Salmonella it was found that a pre-incubation step in 1% w/v glycerol-tryptic soy broth for 1 h prior to plating, significantly increased recovery of the pathogen compared to TSB alone. However, no increased recovery of L. monocytogenes was observed using the TSB-glycerol pre-incubation step. No Salmonella was detected on cornflakes, chocolate crumb and strawberry using 1.25 parts per thousand (‰) PAA-ethanol. The inactivation of Salmonella on deshelled pistachio was significantly higher using 2.5‰ PAA-ethanol sanitizer compared to the AOP treatments tested. Only negligible reductions of Salmonella (<1 log cfu) were obtained with shell-on pistachio treated with PAA-ethanol sanitizer or AOP. Salmonella could be reduced on dried apple slices by >4 log CFU when 5.0‰ PAA-ethanol was applied. L. monocytogenes was more sensitive to PAA-ethanol compared to Salmonella and could be eliminated on all the LMFs apart from shell-on pistachio. An AOP treatment applied 10% v/v hydrogen peroxide, ozone and 54 mJ/cm2 UV-C could significantly reduce Salmonella on dried apple slices compared to when the individual elements (hydrogen peroxide, ozone or UV-C) were applied. Salmonella was also eliminated by AOP on the other LMFs (apart from shell-on pistachio) although the same level of inactivation was achieved by spraying with 10% v/v hydrogen peroxide alone. L. monocytogenes was sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and AOP being eliminated from all the LMFs. Although this may suggest that hydrogen peroxide spray was equivalent to AOP treatment it was noted that no residual H2O2 or changes in visual appearance was evident on samples treated with the latter process. The study has demonstrated that the two decontamination methods assessed can be applied to reduce Salmonella and L. monocytogenes on LMFs although efficacy is dependent on the pathogen and product type.",

      "abstract": "Salivary proteins have the potential to alter oral sensory perception of foods. In rodents, dietary polyphenol exposure increases salivary concentrations of polyphenol-binding proteins and several cystatins, which correlate with less aversion to polyphenol-rich solutions. If similar salivary shifts occur in humans, then increasing dietary polyphenols may improve orosensory experience of polyphenol-rich foods. We hypothesized that small dietary changes, focused on polyphenols, would increase expression of salivary binding proteins for polyphenols and thus suppress unpleasant polyphenol sensations. However, analogs of salivary polyphenol-binding proteins are found in foods. Thus, we also hypothesized that food-sourced analogs of these salivary proteins would mitigate changes in saliva and sensation. Human subjects (N=55) alternated weeks of consuming a low polyphenol diet and then a regular diet plus a polyphenol-rich chocolate milk (almond, containing no polyphenol-binding proteins, or bovine, containing polyphenol-binding proteins). Statistical analyses revealed both chocolate milk interventions corresponded to changes in relative expression of 96 proteins and calculated concentration of 146 proteins (both after correction for false discovery rate), out of 1,176 proteins identified through proteomics. Of the proteins that changed, proline-rich proteins and cystatins were noticeable, which reflects prior work in animal studies. Subjects rated all chocolate milks as less flavorful after the bovine chocolate milk intervention week compared to low polyphenol weeks, but generally sensory changes were minimal. However, the results confirm that dietary changes coincide with salivary changes, and that some of those changes occur in proteins that have potential to influence oral sensations.",

A total of 140 postmenopausal women participated in this randomized and controlled parallel clinical trial. For six months, the intervention group (IG; n = 73) consumed daily 10 g of chocolate (99% cocoa) added to their usual food intake, whereas the control group (CG; n = 67) did not receive any intervention. Blood pressure, pulse pressure (PP), cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI), ankle-brachial index (ABI), brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), augmentation index, and laboratory variables were measured at baseline and six months. ANCOVA analyses adjusted for baseline values revealed no significant differences for systolic blood pressure (-1.45 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval (CI): -4.79, 1.88; p = 0.391) or baPWV (0.18 m/s; 95% CI: -0.14, 0.50; p = 0.263) between groups. A decrease in PP was observed in the IG compared to the CG (-2.05 mm Hg; 95% CI: -4.08, -0.02; p = 0.048). The rest of the vascular structure and function parameters and other measured variables remained unchanged. The daily intake of 10 g of cocoa-rich chocolate seems to provide little improvement to cardiovascular health, but neither does it cause any adverse effects on the parameters evaluated in postmenopausal women in the long term.",

The aim of this investigation was to investigate whether saikosaponins of B. falcatum other than SSA affect alcohol and chocolate self-administration in rats. METHODS: Ovariectomized female Sardinian alcohol-preferring (sP) and Wistar rats were trained to self-administer alcohol (15%, v/v) and a chocolate solution [5% (w/v) Nesquik® in water], respectively, under fixed ratio schedules of reinforcement. The following saikosaponins were compared to SSA: saikosaponin D (SSD; epimer of SSA), saikosaponin C (SSC), saikosaponin B2 (SSB2) and saikosaponin B4 (SSB4). All saikosaponins were tested acutely at the doses of 0, 0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg (i.p.). RESULTS: Treatment with SSA and SSD resulted in highly similar, marked reductions in alcohol self-administration; SSC failed to alter lever-responding for alcohol, while SSB2 and SSB4 produced intermediate reductions. Only SSA and SSD reduced chocolate self-administration, with SSC, SSB2 and SSB4 being ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: The wide spectrum of efficacy of saikosaponins in reducing alcohol and chocolate self-administration suggests that even relatively small structural differences are sufficient to produce remarkable changes in their in vivo pharmacological profile. Together, these results confirm that roots of B. falcatum may be an interesting source of compounds with anti-addictive potential.",

METHODS: Cognitively healthy older adults aged 65-75 years were recruited for an eight-week randomized, double-blind controlled trial to investigate the effectiveness of cocoa flavanols on cognitive functions. At baseline, nutrient and polyphenol intakes from diet were assessed with three-day food diaries. The intervention group received 50 g dark chocolate containing 410 mg of flavanols per day, and the control group 50 g dark chocolate containing 86 mg of flavanols per day, for eight weeks. Cognition was assessed with Verbal Fluency (VF) and the Trail Making Test (TMT) A and B as the main outcome measures. Changes in blood lipids and glucose were also measured. RESULTS: The older adults participating numbered 100 (63% women), mean 69 y (range 65 to 74). They were highly educated with a mean 14.9 years of education (SD 3.6). No differences in changes in cognition were seen between groups. The mean change (± SEs) in the time to complete the TMT A and B in the intervention group was -4.6 s (-7.1 to -2.1) and -16.1 s (-29.1 to -3.1), and in the controls -4.4 s (-7.0 to -1.9) and -12.5 s (-22.8 to -2.1)(TMT A p = 0.93; TMT B p = 0.66).

METHODS: In order to find relevant papers, PubMed and Scopus were searched up to November 2018. Mean differences of eligible trials were pooled using random-effects models (the Der Simonian-Laird estimator). Subgroup analysis was conducted to assess the potential source of heterogeneity. Fractional polynomial modeling was used to explore dose-response relationships. RESULTS: Seventeen studies involving 615 participants assessed the effect of dark chocolate and six included studies involving 179 participants investigated the effect of flavonoids on FMD. Chronic consumption of dark chocolate and flavan-3-ols both increased FMD (0.69, 95% CI 0.22-1.16, p < 0.001, 1.16, 95% CI 0.52-1.80 p = 0.001, respectively). Pooling chronic consumption of dark chocolate and flavonoids improved FMD (p < 0.001) with significant heterogeneity among studies (p < 0.001; I2 = 64.2%). Type of intervention (flavonoid or cocoa, p = 0.230-dark chocolate, p < 0.001) was a source of heterogeneity. Also, we found that acute consumption of dark chocolate (p < 0.001) and both dark chocolate and flavonoids (p < 0.001) had beneficial effects on FMD. Consumption of flavonoids more than 40 g/day increases FMD with the highest mean of FMD in doses around 40-60 g/day. A non-linear dose-response has been also found after the chronic consumption of dark chocolate on FMD with a greater reduction in doses lower than 20 g/day. CONCLUSION: Current evidence indicated the beneficial effect of acute and chronic consumption of dark chocolate and flavonoids on FMD. Non-linear associations should be considered when investigating the effects of dietary intakes on FMD.",

      "abstract": "There is good evidence that cocoa flavonoids can acutely improve cognitive function in humans, possibly via mechanisms such as increased cerebral blood flow. To date, much of the evidence is based on measures of executive function with extracts and cocoa-based interventions with a high flavonoid content. The aim of the present study was to explore whether benefits to episodic verbal memory and mood are observed two hours post consumption of a commercially available dark chocolate (DC) bar relative to a 35 g white chocolate bar (WC). Ninety-eight healthy young adults (n = 57 females) aged 18-24 years consumed either a 35 g DC bar or a calorie-matched low flavonoid WC bar. Verbal episodic memory and mood were assessed pre consumption and 2 h post consumption. An ANOVA analysis showed that the DC was associated with better verbal memory performance for several outcome measures of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test relative to the WC, however, there were no effects on mood. These findings lend support to the notion that everyday available portions of dark chocolate can confer benefits to the brain in healthy consumers.",

      "abstract": "The ability to control impulsive urges is important for maintaining healthy eating habits. Various training strategies have been developed to reduce impulsive urges for food and strengthen cognitive control over tempting food intake. One frequent strategy uses food-inhibition association to alter the associative process between food cues and impulsive urges. Another strategy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to strengthen cognitive control, has received increased attention. Findings, so far, are mixed and limited due to small effect size, interpretational ambiguity, and lack of standardized brain stimulation parameters. We examined whether tempting chocolate snack intake is modulated by food-inhibition association training combined with high-frequency rTMS. In Experiment 1, healthy young adult female volunteers [body mass index (BMI) range, 17-27] performed a food go/no-go task in which chocolate images were consistently paired with either a no-go cue (no-go group, n = 14) or a go cue (go group, n = 14), or both go and no-go cues at equal frequencies (neutral group, n = 15). In Experiment 2, we examined the effect of combined treatment with high-frequency rTMS and food go/no-go training. Sixty healthy young adult female volunteers (BMI range, 15-31) were randomly assigned to one of four groups with equal numbers of participants: rTMS/no-go, rTMS/neutral, sham/no-go, or sham/neutral. rTMS or sham stimulation was applied over the left DLPFC prior to the food go/no-go training task. After training, in both experiments, a taste test was conducted, and the amount of snack intake was measured. In Experiment 1, the no-go training group consumed fewer chocolate snacks than the go training group. No difference was found between the no-go and neutral training groups. In Experiment 2, combined rTMS and no-go training effectively reduced chocolate snack intake compared with neutral training. Although limited by the small sample size, our results suggest the therapeutic potential of combined high-frequency rTMS and food-inhibition association training in enhancing control over the intake of tempting foods in individuals with overeating."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Repeatedly pushing high-calorie food stimuli away based on joystick movements has been found to reduce approach biases toward these stimuli. Some studies also found that such avoidance training reduced consumption of high-calorie foods. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to test effects of a smartphone-based approach-avoidance intervention on chocolate craving and consumption, to make such interventions suitable for daily use. METHODS: Within a 10-day period, regular chocolate eaters (n=105, 86% female) performed five sessions during which they continuously avoided (ie, swiped upward) chocolate stimuli (experimental group, n=35), performed five sessions during which they approached and avoided chocolate stimuli equally often (placebo control group, n=35), or did not perform any training sessions (inactive control group, n=35). Training effects were measured during laboratory sessions before and after the intervention period and further continuously through daily ecological momentary assessment. RESULTS: Self-reported chocolate craving and consumption as well as body fat mass significantly decreased from pre- to postmeasurement across all groups. Ecological momentary assessment reports evidenced no differences in chocolate craving and consumption between intervention days and rest days as a function of the group. CONCLUSIONS: A smartphone-based approach-avoidance training did not affect eating-related and anthropometric measures over and above measurement-based changes in this study. Future controlled studies need to examine whether other techniques of modifying food approach tendencies show an add-on benefit over conventional, monitoring-based intervention effects.

      "abstract": "Chocolate has a complex flavor profile composed of more than 600 volatile compounds that mainly arise from the thermo-mechanical treatment during roasting and conching. The aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of ion mobility spectrometry (IMS), as a real-time method for process monitoring in chocolate manufacture. It is evident from the ion mobility (IM) fingerprint spectra that individual processing steps affect the signal intensities at particular drift time regions. The analysis of individual IM spectra by principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that it is possible to distinguish with respect to conching temperature and time. PCA also allowed identifying those parts of the IM spectra that were predominantly affected by the respective treatment. It was, on the basis of the IM flavor fingerprints and subsequent PCA, possible to distinguish between the different states of processing of bulk cocoa. The results of the study imply that, using appropriate post-data treatment, IMS could be used for process control in cocoa processing."

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: A recently reported randomized clinical trial suggested beneficial effects of vasodilating flavanols in dark chocolate on visual function without objective quantification of retinal perfusion. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of dark chocolate flavanols on subjective visual function and retinal perfusion objectively quantified on optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized, masked double-blind crossover clinical trial analyzed 22 healthy participants at the Department of Ophthalmology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Germany, in July 2018. Analysis was intention to treat. Analysis began in July 2018. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to consume 20 g of dark chocolate containing 400 mg of flavanols or 7.5 g of milk chocolate. Two hours later, visual function and retinal perfusion on OCT angiography were evaluated. Systemic blood pressure was measured to rule out artifacts on OCT angiography. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was macular retinal perfusion quantified as vessel density on OCT angiography. The secondary end point was subjective visual function (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study visual acuity, Pelli-Robson chart, and Mars chart contrast sensitivity). RESULTS: All 22 participants (13 women [59.1%]; mean [SD] age, 27.3 [11.1] years) completed the trial. No relevant differences in baseline parameters between groups were identified. No change in the primary outcome measure, retinal perfusion, could be detected after consumption of dark vs milk chocolate (superficial plexus 48.0% vs 47.5%, treatment effect: -0.59 [95% CI, -2.68 to 1.50], P = .56; deep plexus 54.1% vs 54.0%, treatment effect: -1.14 [95% CI, -4.01 to 1.73], P = .42). No differences in changes in the secondary outcome parameters Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study visual acuity, Pelli-Robson chart, or Mars chart contrast sensitivity could be detected. Potentially confounding effects of changes in blood pressure were excluded. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In contrast to a previous similarly sized randomized clinical trial reporting beneficial effects on visual function, no short-term effects of flavanol-rich dark chocolate on automatically assessed retinal blood flow on OCT angiography or subjective visual function were observed in this study. As this small trial does not rule out the possibility of benefits, further trials with larger sample sizes would be needed to rule in or out possible long-term benefits confidently.

Four UASB reactors were operated at different temperature (15, 20, 25 and 30 °C) and three OLRappl (2, 4 and 6 kg soluble chemical oxygen demand (CODs)/(m3 d)). The flowrate and the hydraulic retention time were constant (11.5 L/d and 6 h, respectively). The monitored parameters were pH, temperature, CODs, and total and volatile suspended solids. The CODs removal efficiency (RE) and biogas production rate (BPR) were calculated. The 15 °C UASB reactor had the lowest RE (39 to 78%) due to the low operating temperature. Regardless of the OLRappl, the RE of the 20, 25 and 30 °C reactors was high and similar to each other (between 88 and 94%). The BPR of the four UASB reactors had the same behaviour as the RE (BPR of 15 °C: 0.3 to 0.5 Lbiogas/(Lreactor d) (Lb/(Lr d)) and BPR of 20, 25 and 30 °C: 0.5 to 1.9 Lb/(Lr d)).",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate and explore the benefits of long-term dark chocolate intake in young, healthy adults by measuring cardiovascular function. METHODS: A randomized study was conducted with 30 healthy participants ages 18 to 27 y. Half of the participants ingested a 20-g dose of lower cocoa chocolate (LCC; ∼55%; 12.6 ± 1.4 mg equivalent of epicatechin/g) and the others ingested a daily dose of 20 g of higher cocoa chocolate (HCC; ∼90%; 18.2 ± 2.6 mg equivalent of epicatechin/g). A baseline evaluation was performed before the participants started ingesting the assigned chocolate for a 30-d period, after which a final evaluation was performed. Each evaluation included heart ultrasonography, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) and carotid pulse wave analysis, flow-mediated slowing (FMS), and an analysis of the ventricular-arterial coupling (VAC), which reflects the matching between the aorta and the left ventricle (ratio of arterial elastance to left ventricle elastance). RESULTS: The baseline evaluation presented similar values within normal range in both groups. The positive vascular effects were overall more distinct in the group eating the HCC. No structural modifications on the heart were found after the intervention, notwithstanding cardiac function was improved on certain functional parameters in the HCC group only. A statistically significant improvement was depicted over the brachial and central systolic and pulse pressures in the HCC group, and a trend for improvement in the reflected waves component (Aix) and the FMS was also observed in the HCC, but not in the LCC group. VAC parameters were similar at baseline between groups, but showed a significant improvement in the HCC group after intervention, increasing from 0.674 to 0.719 (P = 0.004), so that the post-intervention VAC was significantly higher in the HCC group than in the LCC group (P < 0.05). In addition, significant variation was observed in both groups regarding arterial and left ventricle elastances, stroke work, and potential energy, with greater mean differences identified in the HCC group. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that regular consumption of HCC has beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system in young, healthy adults, improving vascular function by reducing central brachial artery pressures and promoting vascular relaxation, and thus enhancing the matching of the arterial system with the left ventricle.",

Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) play an important physiological role for their reparative potential of vascular integrity, but are numerically reduced and functionally impaired in patients with cardiovascular risks. This study assesses the effects of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) and apple-enriched dark chocolate intake on the blood levels of EPCs. Methods: Thirty volunteers with cardiovascular risk factors, enrolled in a randomised, crossover, four-weeks trial, received a solid dark chocolate bar (40 g/day) containing 10% EVOO or 2.5% dry apples. Urine samples were analyzed for endogenous metabolites. Circulating EPCs levels, clinical data and anthropometric examinations were collected. RESULTS: 26 volunteers (M/F:14/12, 51 ± 9 years of age) completed the study. Comparison of pre-post intervention revealed a significant increase in EPCs levels associated with EVOO-dark chocolate consumption. Most biochemical parameters were not significantly modified by both chocolates. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that a daily consumption of a non fattening dose of dark chocolate enriched with EVOO improves blood levels of EPCs, a well known surrogate biologic marker for endothelial function."

However, it remains unclear whether a single session of tDCS combined with a cognitive bias modification (CBM) task may affect explicit and implicit measures of craving for chocolate. Fifty-one healthy volunteers (38 females; mean age: 22.12 ± 3.38) were randomly allocated to CBM training based on the Approach Avoidance task and either Sham, Right anodal-Left cathodal (RALC), or Left anodal-Right cathodal (LARC) tDCS. Results show that there was an increase in the explicit craving for chocolate, as assessed by the Visual Analog Scale [F(2, 46) = 3.239, p = 0.048], from the baseline to post-intervention. Participants which received LARC tDCS were explicitly self-reporting more craving for chocolate than those that received RALC tDCS (p = 0.023). Moreover, this effect was also observed on the implicit measure [F(2, 46) = 4.168, p = 0.022]. LARC tDCS significantly increased the implicit preference for chocolate when comparing to both RALC (p = 0.009) and Sham tDCS (p = 0.034). Previous studies have shown that RALC tDCS over the PFC is able to effectively decrease craving for food. Interestingly, the present data not only does not reproduce such result, but instead it suggests that LARC tDCS can actually increase the preference for chocolate. This result is compatible with recent models of brain laterality, in which cue craving seems to be more dependent on the left hemisphere. Thus, shifting the activity to the left hemisphere (while simultaneously reducing the activity over the homotopic region) may have led to this increased implicit as well as explicit preference for chocolate."

Daily oral administration of LYC in constipated rats for two weeks was shown to significantly increase (n = 14) the defecation frequency, fecal moisture content, and relative abundance of fecal Lactobacillus and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Moreover, histological analysis of the distal colon of constipated rats revealed that LYC treatment can also increase the thickness of the colonic mucosa and muscle layers, and crypt of Lieberkühn. LYC also significantly increased (n = 5) the intestinal motility and modulated (n = 9) mRNA expression levels of colonic ZO-1 and Cldn-1 in the constipated rats.

This study will aim to assess the effect of adding a daily amount of chocolate high in cocoa content and polyphenols to the normal diet on blood pressure, vascular function, cognitive performance, quality of life and body composition in postmenopausal women. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Here we plan a randomised clinical trial with two parallel groups involving a total of 140 women between 50 and 64 years in the postmenopausal period, defined by amenorrhoea of ​​at least 12 consecutive months. The main variable will be the change in blood pressure. Secondary variables will be changes in vascular function, quality of life, cognitive performance and body composition. The intervention group will be given chocolate containing 99% cocoa, with instructions to add 10 g daily to their normal diet for 6 months. The daily nutritional contribution of this amount of chocolate is 59 kcal and 65.4 mg of polyphenols. There will be no intervention in the control group. All variables will be measured at the baseline visit and 3 and 6 months after randomisation, except cognitive performance and quality of life, which will only be assessed at baseline and at 6 months. Recruitment is scheduled to begin on 1 June 2018, and the study will continue until 31 May 2019. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Health Area of Salamanca, Spain ('CREC of Health Area of Salamanca'), in February 2018. A SPIRIT checklist is available for this protocol. The clinical trial has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov provided by the US National Library of Medicine, number NCT03492983. The results will be disseminated through open access peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations, broadcast media and a presentation to stakeholders.",

METHODS: This randomized, controlled, parallel-group intervention study included 32 Japanese college students (mean age, 20.7 ± 0.3 y; men, n = 24; women, n = 8) who were assigned to either control or intervention groups (n = 16 each). The control group did not alter their habitual diet or physical activity throughout the study period. The intervention group consumed 20 g/d (508 mg of cacao polyphenol) of high-cocoa chocolate for 4 wk. Blood pressure, heart-ankle pulse wave velocity, cardio-ankle vascular index, body composition, and metabolic characteristics during exercise at 50% maximal oxygen uptake level were assessed before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Four weeks of high-cocoa chocolate ingestion significantly reduced heart-ankle pulse wave velocity and cardio-ankle vascular index (%change, intervention versus control: -2.3 ± 0.9% versus 0.9 ± 0.9%, and -4.8 ± 1.8% versus 0.7 ± 1.3%, respectively; both P < 0.05). However, blood pressure, weight, body mass index, body fat, waist circumference, and metabolic characteristics during exercise such as respiratory exchange ratio did not significantly change in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Four weeks of regular high-cocoa chocolate consumption reduced arterial stiffness after considering blood pressure in healthy young men and women. However, the habitual consumption of high-cocoa chocolate for 4 wk did not affect metabolic characteristics during light- to moderate-intensity exercise and body composition.",

Rats were administered chocolate containing 2.5 × 1010  CFU g-1 of probiotics daily for 4 weeks and treated with loperamide (5 mg kg-1 ) daily at the fourth week of treatment. RESULTS: Probiotic chocolate treatment significantly (P < 0.05) increased the intestinal motility, colon length, fecal moisture content and number of excreted fecal pellets in constipated rats. Moreover, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction data and histological images also revealed that both probiotic chocolate LYC and BB12 treatments were capable of upregulating the mRNA expression levels of colonic ZO-1, occludin and AQP8, leading to the maintenance of the defensive barrier function in the constipated rats compared with the negative controls. Interestingly, these treatments also modulated gut bacterial populations by increasing the abundance levels of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, as well as reducing the abundance level of Enterobacteriaceae. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that probiotic chocolate LYC and BB12 could potentially be used as alternative agents for prophylactic constipation. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.",

This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of dark chocolate on inflammatory markers, serum adiponectin, and certain biochemical factors in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS: This study was a randomized parallel clinical trial. Thirty grams of 84% dark chocolate, along with therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLCs) guidelines, were administrated to patients with T2D. Control group received only TLC guidelines. The intervention period was 8 weeks. Twenty-one subjects in dark chocolate and 23 subjects in control group completed the study. Fasting blood samples were collected before and after the intervention period and inflammatory markers, biochemical factors, and adiponectin levels were assessed. RESULTS: Fasting blood sugar, hemoglobin A1C, low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels declined significantly in the dark chocolate group and this decrease was significant between the intervention and control groups. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and high sensitive C-reactive protein were significantly decreased in the dark chocolate group. Adiponectin levels were not significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this study subjects who received dark chocolate along with TLC guidelines had lower levels of inflammatory markers such as hs-CRP, TNF-α, and IL-6, compared with the subjects who were devoid of dark chocolate and followed only the TLC guidelines. Other studies should be conducted to evaluate the most effective and administrative dosage of dark chocolate as a snack along with the common treatment of diabetes."

DESIGN: Randomized, blinded, four-arm, prospective study. SETTINGS: Lycotec Ltd, Cambridge, United Kingdom and Institute of Cardiology, Saratov, Russian Federation. PARTICIPANTS: 32 healthy individuals aged 60-70 years with confirmed signs of oxidative stress (increased serum levels of oxidized LDL and malonic dialdehyde) randomized into four study groups (8 volunteers each). INTERVENTION: Volunteers of first group were given orally 10 gr of dark chocolate (DC). Individuals from the second group received 7 mg of astaxanthin (ASTX). Third group of volunteers was supplemented with 10 gr of DC and 7 mg of ASTX ingested simultaneously as two separate formulations. Last group of the individuals was given 10 gr of a lycosomal formulation of DC containing 7 mg of co-crystalized ASTX (L-DC-ASTX), a newly developed highly bioavailable nutraceutical composition of DC containing 2 groups of antioxidants (cocoa flavanols and ASTX). All formulations were given orally, once daily for a month. MEASUREMENTS: Serum ASTX was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Nitric oxide, malonic dialdehyde and oxidized LDL were quantified spectrophotometrically. Oxygenation parameters were evaluated by near-infrared spectroscopy. RESULTS: One month ingestion of singular formulation of ASTX lead to a 20 fold buildup in serum ASTX level whereas the 4 week ingestion of L-DC-ASTX formulation was accompanied by more prominent accumulation of ASTX in serum (a 40 fold increase over the basal values) at the same daily dose of ASTX. Both antioxidants taken separately decreased serum levels of oxidized LDL and malonic dialdehyde. However effect of L-DC-ASTX formulation was more prominent. ASTX ingested alone caused a borderline increase (p=0.054) in serum nitric oxide (NO) levels, whereas DC ingestion lead to small but statistically significant increase in serum NO concentration. Higher values of NO level were seen after co-ingestion of DC and ASTX, especially in case of L-DC-ASTX formulation suggesting additive/synergistic effects of DC and ASTX on nitric oxide production. These changes were in agreement with the increase in plasma oxygen transport and tissue oxygen saturation seen in the volunteers supplemented with L-DC-ASTX formulation. CONCLUSION: The nutraceutical formulation of DC and ASTX with an enhanced bioavailability of ASTX can be efficiently used for the correction of oxidative status in aging individuals.",

In the present work, we evaluated the genoprotective effect of the consumption of flavonoids-rich chocolate on 84 young volunteers. Biochemical indicators related to the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular risk and metabolic syndrome were also determined. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was performed in the Autonomous University of Baja California. The treatments comprised the daily consumption of either 2 g of dark chocolate containing 70% cocoa, or 2 g of milk chocolate, for 6 months. The total amount of phenolic compounds and flavonoids was determined in both types of chocolate. Anthropometrical and Biochemical parameters were recorded prior to and after the study. The evaluation of the genotoxicity in buccal epithelial cells was performed throughout the duration of the study. Flavonoids from cocoa in dark chocolate significantly prevented DNA damage, and improved the nucleus integrity of cells. This effect could be related to the antioxidant capacity of the dark chocolate that decreased cellular stress. Biochemical parameters (total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-cholesterol level in blood) and anthropometrical parameters (waist circumference) were improved after six months of daily intake of 2 g of dark chocolate with a 70% of cocoa.",

However, a thorough evaluation of chocolate phenolic profile is still lacking. This study aimed at a comprehensive characterization of dark chocolate phenolic profile, using non-targeted mass spectrometry identification. This approach allowed a tentative identification of 158 individual phenolic compounds: 67 were newly detected in dark chocolate, among these 38 were observed for the first time in chocolate as well as in cocoa beans or products. Ellagitannins, which have never been reported in cocoa or chocolate, represented about the 10% of the phenolic profile of dark chocolate. The enrichment of dark chocolate with Sakura green tea leaves or turmeric powder influenced and modified the phenolic profile, resulting in a phenolic concentration increase. In this way, this functional chocolate might maximize the beneficial effect of chocolate consumption, combining the positive health effects of chocolate, turmeric and green tea and, at the same time, reducing the amount of sugars and calories introduced with chocolate.",

The manufacture of SMP is a multistage process involving a preliminary concentration step, heat treatment, and a drying stage. However, the methods and conditions used by the industry are not standardized, and the inherent variability in the production of SMP has consequences for the end-users, such as the confectionery industry, where the SMP is used as an ingredient during the production of milk chocolate, white chocolate, and caramel. This study investigates the effect of each stage of the manufacturing process on the concentration of reducing sugars and available amino groups (as precursors of the Maillard reaction) as well as on the volatile products of the Maillard reaction and lipid degradation. Eight types of SMP were produced using combinations of different processing conditions: concentration (by evaporation or reverse osmosis), heat treatment (low heat or high heat), and drying (spray-drying or freeze-drying). Maillard precursors were quantified after each processing stage and volatile compounds were extracted using solid-phase microextraction, and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The resulting SMP were incorporated into a model white chocolate system, produced under varying conching conditions. We demonstrate not only that changes in the SMP manufacturing conditions affect the volatile profile of SMP, but also that these differences can be carried through to a final product when the SMP is used to prepare a model white chocolate. Understanding these differences is important to the industry for controlling the flavor of the end product.",

We therefore aimed to map and grade the diverse health outcomes associated with chocolate consumption using an umbrella review of systematic reviews. METHODS: Umbrella review of systematic reviews of observational and intervention studies (randomized placebo-controlled trials, RCTs). For each association, random-effects summary effect size, 95% confidence interval, and 95% prediction interval were estimated. We also assessed heterogeneity, evidence for small-study effect and evidence for excess significance bias. For significant outcomes of the RCTs, the GRADE assessment was furtherly used. RESULTS: From 240 articles returned, 10 systematic reviews were included (8 of which included a meta-analysis), including a total of 84 studies (36 prospective observational studies and 48 interventional). Nineteen different outcomes were included. Among observational studies, including a total of 1,061,637 participants, the best available evidence suggests that chocolate consumption is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) death (n = 4 studies), acute myocardial infarction (n = 6), stroke (n = 5) and diabetes (n = 6), although this was based on a weak evidence of credibility. Across meta-analyses of intervention studies, chocolate consumption was positively associated with flow-mediated dilatation at 90-150 min (n = 3) and at 2-18 weeks (n = 3), and insulin resistance markers (n = 2). However, using the GRADE assessment, the evidence for these outcomes was low or very low. Data from two systematic reviews, reported that chocolate consumption was not associated with better depressive mood or cognitive function. CONCLUSIONS: There is weak evidence to suggest that chocolate consumption may be associated with favorable health outcomes.",

The primary endpoint of procedure success was achieved in 85.1% of cases, and freedom from stenting occurred in 93.1%. Bail out stenting by independent adjudication occurred in 1.6% of cases and there were no flow limiting dissections. There was mean improvement of 2.1 Rutherford classes (±1.5) at 12-months, with 78.5% freedom from TLR, 97.2% freedom from major amputation, and 93.3% freedom from all-cause mortality. Core Lab adjudicated patency was 64.1% at 12 months. Use of the Chocolate balloon in an \"all-comers\" population achieved excellent procedural outcomes with low dissection rates and bailout stent use.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Consumption of almonds or dark chocolate and cocoa has favorable effects on markers of coronary heart disease; however, the combined effects have not been evaluated in a well-controlled feeding study. The aim of this study was to examine the individual and combined effects of consumption of dark chocolate and cocoa and almonds on markers of coronary heart disease risk. METHODS AND RESULTS: A randomized controlled, 4-period, crossover, feeding trial was conducted in overweight and obese individuals aged 30 to 70 years. Forty-eight participants were randomized, and 31 participants completed the entire study. Each diet period was 4 weeks long, followed by a 2-week compliance break. Participants consumed each of 4 isocaloric, weight maintenance diets: (1) no treatment foods (average American diet), (2) 42.5 g/d of almonds (almond diet [ALD]), (3) 18 g/d of cocoa powder and 43 g/d of dark chocolate (chocolate diet [CHOC]), or (4) all 3 foods (CHOC+ALD). Compared with the average American diet, total cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol after the ALD were lower by 4%, 5%, and 7%, respectively (P<0.05). The CHOC+ALD decreased apolipoprotein B by 5% compared with the average American diet. For low-density lipoprotein subclasses, compared with the average American diet, the ALD showed a greater reduction in large buoyant low-density lipoprotein particles (-5.7±2.3 versus -0.3±2.3 mg/dL; P=0.04), whereas the CHOC+ALD had a greater decrease in small dense low-density lipoprotein particles (-12.0±2.8 versus -5.3±2.8 mg/dL; P=0.04). There were no significant differences between diets for measures of vascular health and oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that consumption of almonds alone or combined with dark chocolate under controlled-feeding conditions improves lipid profiles. Incorporating almonds, dark chocolate, and cocoa into a typical American diet without exceeding energy needs may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.

We assessed desire to eat, salivation, CS-US expectancies, and eating in the absence of hunger (EAH) during and after cue exposure. Participants (N = 71) were chocolate-loving female students who tried to eat less chocolate in daily life. They received two sessions of either cue exposure with Go/No Go training (EXP + GNG), cue exposure with a sham training (EXP + shamGNG), or a control procedure with sham training (CON + shamGNG). Results showed that the exposure groups had higher desire to eat and higher levels of salivation during exposure compared to the control group during the control intervention, and that within session and between session habituation occurred in all conditions. In contrast to our hypotheses, lower levels of desire and salivation in the EXP + GNG compared to the EXP + shamGNG group at the end of exposure were not found. In addition, there was an overall decrease in CS-US expectancies with no group differences, and these beliefs were unrelated to EAH. Furthermore, groups did not differ on intake of either the exposed chocolate, non-exposed chocolate or other snack food items. It is concluded that a short Go/No Go training does not have an effect on two sessions of cue exposure treatment.",

Such substances can be found in traces in simulants and in food products put in contact with plastic materials. In this context, it is important to set up analytical systems characterized by high sensitivity and to improve detection parameters to enhance signals. This work was aimed at optimizing a method based on UHPLC coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry to quantify the most common plastic additives, and able to detect the presence of polymers degradation products and coloring agents migrating from plastic re-usable containers. The optimization of mass spectrometric parameter settings for quantitative analysis of additives has been achieved by a chemometric approach, using a full factorial and d-optimal experimental designs, allowing to evaluate possible interactions between the investigated parameters. Results showed that the optimized method was characterized by improved features in terms of sensitivity respect to existing methods and was successfully applied to the analysis of a complex model food system such as chocolate put in contact with 14 polycarbonate tableware samples. A new procedure for sample pre-treatment was carried out and validated, showing high reliability. Results reported, for the first time, the presence of several molecules migrating to chocolate, in particular belonging to plastic additives, such Cyasorb UV5411, Tinuvin 234, Uvitex OB, and oligomers, whose amount was found to be correlated to age and degree of damage of the containers.",

      "abstract": "Chocolate is a product processed from cocoa rich in flavonoids, antioxidant compounds, and bioactive ingredients that have been associated with both its healthy and sensory properties. Chocolate production consists of a multistep process which, starting from cocoa beans, involves fermentation, drying, roasting, nib grinding and refining, conching, and tempering. During cocoa processing, the naturally occurring antioxidants (flavonoids) are lost, while others, such as Maillard reaction products, are formed. The final content of antioxidant compounds and the antioxidant activity of chocolate is a function of several variables, some related to the raw material and others related to processing and formulation. The aim of this mini-review is to revise the literature on the impact of full processing on the in vitro antioxidant activity of chocolate, providing a critical analysis of the implications of processing on the evaluation of the antioxidant effect of chocolate in in vivo studies in humans."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: HIV/AIDS is generally associated with dyslipidemia and oxidative imbalance, which are caused by the infection itself and by antiretroviral therapy (ART). The flavonoids, found in cocoa and yerba mate, have antioxidant and hypolipidemic properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the consumption of dark chocolate and mate tea on the lipid profiles of individuals with HIV/AIDS who are undergoing ART. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial was conducted with 92 patients receiving ART for ≥6 mo and with viral suppression. The participants were randomized to receive either 65 g of chocolate (with 2148 mg polyphenols) or placebo chocolate (without polyphenols) or 3 g of mate tea (with 107 mg total phenols and 84.24 mg chlorogenic acid) or placebo mate (without polyphenols) for 15 d each, separated by a washout period of 15 d. The lipid profile, including determination of electronegative low-density lipoprotein, was determined after each intervention. The data were analyzed by analysis of variance using the pkcross procedure of the Stata 11.0 software. RESULTS: Analysis of variance revealed a significant overall difference in mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) between all supplements (P = 0.047). Using the paired t test, the effect was attributed to the consumption of dark chocolate (P = 0.046). The other parameters investigated were not improved. CONCLUSIONS: The consumption of dark chocolate for 15 d improved HDL-C concentrations of individuals with HIV/AIDS undergoing ART, possibly due to the presence of fatty acids (stearic acid), polyphenols, and theobromine. This fact is important for the cardiovascular protection of these individuals.",

      "abstract": "Evaluative conditioning (EC) procedures can be used to form and change attitudes toward a wide variety of objects. The current study examined the effects of a negative EC procedure on attitudes toward chocolate, and whether it influenced chocolate evaluation and consumption. Participants were randomly assigned to the experimental condition in which chocolate images were paired with negative stimuli, or the control condition in which chocolate images were randomly paired with positive stimuli (50%) and negative stimuli (50%). Explicit and implicit attitudes toward chocolate images were collected. During an ostensible taste test, chocolate evaluation and consumption were assessed. Results revealed that compared to participants in the control condition, participants in the experimental condition showed more negative explicit and implicit attitudes toward chocolate images and evaluated chocolate more negatively during the taste test. However, chocolate consumption did not differ between experimental and control conditions. These findings suggest that pairing chocolate with negative stimuli can influence attitudes toward chocolate, though behavioral effects are absent. Intervention applications of EC provide avenues for future research and practices."
