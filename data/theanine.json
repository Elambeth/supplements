      "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) is an anthracycline antibiotic widely used as an antineoplastic agent. L-theanine (LTN) is a unique amino acid obtained from tea (Camellia sinensis) and a highly valuable nutraceutical additive in the food industry. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of LTN on ovarian endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in DOX-induced rats. The rats were divided into one of four groups: Control (saline), DOX (20 mg/kg DOX, i.p.), DOX + LTN200 (DOX + 200 mg/kg LTN) and DOX + LTN400 (DOX + 400 mg/kg LTN). DOX was administered on the first day, followed by three consecutive days of LTN via oral gavage. The levels of ERS (GRP78, IRE1, and CHOP), oxidative stress (TOS, OSI, and MDA), inflammation (TNF-α) and fertility (E2 and PGN) parameters were analyzed using ELISA or assay kits. In addition, morphological and apoptotic (DNA fragmentation) changes in ovarian tissues were examined histologically. The study found that both doses of LTN were effective in reversing DOX-induced ERS by lowering oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, and alleviating morphological changes. However, the 400 mg/kg LTN group exhibited more significant effects. LTN treatment thus has the potential to alleviate the adverse effects on ovarian tissue caused by DOX by modulating the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and associated conditions."

      "abstract": "L-theanine (L-Thea), a bioactive amino acid found in tea, demonstrates remarkable nutraceutical properties. Isoproterenol (ISO) has been utilized as a reliable and potent agent to induce heart failure (HF) in murine models. The aim of this study was to explore the mechanisms through which L-Thea alleviates ISO-induced cardiac damage via the examination of proteomic and metabolomic data. Herein, we first successfully developed an ISO-induced cardiac injury model in mice. Then, the intervention with L-Thea demonstrated an improvement in cardiac performance and enhanced ventricular function. The results of histological assessments suggested that L-Thea has the potential to mitigate inflammatory infiltration, cardiomyocytes loss, and myocardial fibrosis in heart tissue affected by ISO-induced cardiac injuries in mice. Moreover, the proteomic data indicated that L-Thea led to a significant reduction in apoptosis, the p53 signaling pathway, and the IL-17 signaling pathway within cardiac tissue. Significantly, there were five KEGG pathways that were shown in both the proteome and metabolome, including apoptosis, purine metabolism, cAMP signaling pathway, ABC transporters and cytochrome P450. The western blot results further confirmed that L-Thea induced the downregulation of BAX (pro-apoptotic protein) and the upregulation of BCL-2 (anti-apoptotic protein), thereby suppressing apoptosis in the cardiac tissue of mice. Collectively, L-Thea possesses the capacity to function as a dietary supplement for the prevention or management of cardiac damage induced by ISO.",

      "abstract": "The rising prevalence of heat stress (HS), because of global warming, presents a considerable challenge to both human and animal health and welfare. L-Theanine (LTA), a naturally occurring amino acid, may enhance poultry muscle yield and quality, suggesting its potential application in alleviating the negative impacts of HS. However, the molecular mechanisms through which LTA exerts its beneficial effects remain to be fully understood. This study explored the protective effects of LTA on cultured broiler skeletal muscle cells under oxidative stress induced by HS, focusing on the molecular mechanisms involved. Our findings indicate that treatment with LTA significantly improved cell survival, bolstered the activity of antioxidant enzymes, decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) contents and diminished malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in HS-treated cultured cells. Furthermore, LTA enhanced the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathways in HS-treated cultured cells, facilitating mitochondrial biogenesis and reducing cell apoptosis. The protective effects of LTA in HS-treated cultured cells were significantly reduced by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or the Nrf2 inhibitor ML385. In conclusion, our study showed that LTA protects cultured skeletal muscle cells from HS-induced oxidative damage by modulating the PI3K/AKT/Nrf2 signaling pathway, positioning LTA as a promising natural antioxidant for poultry feed additives aimed at improving muscle health."

L-theanine, also known as γ-glutamyl ethylamide, is a non-protein amino acid, naturally obtained from tea and has structural similarity with the neurotransmitter glutamate. This study was conducted to evaluate the role of L-theanine, in the prevention of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) mediated atopic dermatitis (AD) in BALB/c mice. To achieve our goal, serological, histological, immunohistochemical and behavioural analyses, biochemical assays, immunophenotyping, skin scoring, etc. were carried out. L-theanine and DNCB docking with filaggrin protein was also checked as a part of in-silico analysis. No significant changes in serological profile were found, however, a substantial rise in leukocytes and macrophages were observed in the DNCB administered animals. L-theanine treatment altered such effects. ProTox profiling of L-theanine didn't show cytotoxicity. No significant changes were observed in any other profiling assays except in the skin histology. Further, L-theanine was found to bind more effectively at the active site of filaggrin (key protein affected in AD) than DNCB. Therefore, L-theanine represents itself as a potent ameliorative agent against DNCB induced atopic dermatitis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health concern, often resulting in significant brain damage and functional impairments. A key contributing factor to TBI-induced neuronal injury is the overactivation of AMPA glutamate receptors, leading to an increased influx of calcium and zinc ions. This study investigates the neuroprotective potential of l-theanine, known for its antioxidant potential and ability to enhance glutathione synthesis, against hippocampal damage in a TBI rat model. METHODS: Rats subjected to TBIs were treated with two dosages of l-theanine (100 and 200 mg/kg) and an AMPA receptor inhibitor, NBQX (30 mg/kg). The neuronal damage assessment, conducted 24 h post-injury, involved a histological analysis, focusing on the factors of neuronal death, oxidative damage, and glial cell activation. The statistical analysis included the performance of an ANOVA followed by a Bonferroni post hoc test, with the data presented as mean ± SEM values and the significance determined at p < 0.05. RESULTS: Treatment with l-theanine was observed to significantly mitigate the zinc accumulation, neuronal death, and cognitive impairments associated with TBI. These benefits are likely attributed to the inhibition of AMPA receptor activity and reduction in neuroinflammation, possibly enhanced as a result of increased glutathione production. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that l-theanine can perform a neuroprotective role in TBI, modulating AMPA receptor activation and diminishing neuroinflammation. Its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties further enhance the material's potential use as a therapeutic agent for reducing hippocampal damage caused as a result of a TBI.",

      "abstract": "With the increasing prevalence of diabetes, the search for natural compounds with potential anti-hyperglycemic effects has become a key focus in food and nutrition research. L-theanine (THE) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) from tea are gaining attention due to their antioxidant and metabolic regulation properties. Although they have been shown to have an effect on glucose metabolism, their synergistic effect on starch digestive properties and the mechanism remain unclear. Here, we explored that THE and EGCG synergistically regulated starch digestive properties in ultrasound treatment through two different perspectives. At specific THE/EGCG ratios (THE/EGCG1:1), maize starch granules exhibited significant aggregation and densification. THE promoted the ordered arrangement of starch molecular chains through hydrogen bonding, and the polyphenolic structure of EGCG further stabilised this ordered structure, thus enhancing the crystallinity and short-range ordering of starch. It meant that THE and EGCG further reduced starch digestibility by synergistically modulating the multi-scale structure of starch. In addition, THE and EGCG exhibited significant synergistic inhibition of α-amylase activity (1.6 mM THE and 0.05 mg/mL EGCG). The multi-spectral results showed that the addition of THE and EGCG enhanced the conformational change of the enzyme, leading to the change of the secondary structure, and the synergistic effect might originate from the multiple interactions of THE and EGCG with different amino acid residues in the digestive enzyme (e.g., THR-163, GLN-63, ASP-197, etc), which strengthened the inhibition, and the molecular dynamics simulations further supported the findings. This work promotes the further development and utilisation of endogenous substances in tea and provides some references for the development of food ingredients with potential hypoglycaemic functions.",

      "abstract": "Theanine is a crucial indicator of tea quality, and its significance is closely tied to the economic value of tea. There have been many reports on the regulation mechanism of theanine synthesis and accumulation, but the mechanism by which gibberellin regulates theanine synthesis in tea plants is poorly understood. Previous studies have shown that the content of theanine experiences significant changes in the growth stages of tea shoots, displaying a strong correlation with gibberellin. This study confirmed that gibberellin significantly promoted the expression of the major gene of theanine synthesis, known as CsTSI. Additionally, the study identified CsWRKY71 as a transcription factor that mediated the regulation by gibberellin of theanine synthesis in tea plants. CsWRKY71 was localized in the nucleus and had a typical WRKY domain. It was a member of subclass IIC and its expression was significantly suppressed following exogenous GA3 treatment. Further assays, such as the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, dual luciferase and asODN (antisense oligodeoxynucleotide) interference, demonstrated that CsWRKY71 significantly interacted with the promoter of CsTSI, which inhibited theanine synthesis by binding to the cis-acting element (C/T)TGAC(T/C) of the CsTSI promoter. Overall, the addition of exogenous gibberellin alleviated the inhibition of CsTSI by down-regulating the expression of CsWRKY71, ultimately facilitating the rapid biosynthesis of theanine. This study elucidated the molecular mechanism of CsWRKY71-mediated gibberellin regulation of theanine synthesis in tea plant. The findings not only enhance our understanding of the regulatory processes involved in theanine synthesis in tea plants, but also provide important references for maintaining the characteristics of high theanine in the tea plant."

Accordingly, assessing participants' physiological and psychological factors related to tension, anxiety, and stress represents a valuable resource for enhancing performance. This study examines the impact of L-theanine administration on archers&apos; cognitive anxiety levels, salivary alpha-amylase (sAA), and salivary cortisol (sC) in archery competition. METHODS: The study included 18 athletes from women&apos;s colleges who participated in the 50-meter individual competition at the 40th president&apos;s cup national archery competition in June 2023. Athletes' anxiety levels were assessed on a Likert scale, ranging from 1 \"not at all\" to 10 \"extremely anxious.\" Saliva samples were collected 30, 20, and 10 minutes before and 20 minutes after the game. Repeated measures of the general linear model ANOVA were performed to compare the mean values of sAA and anxiety level. RESULTS: Cognitive anxiety levels were significantly reduced in the treatment compared to the placebo group at 10 minutes before the game (p&lt;.05); sAA levels were significantly reduced in the treatment group compared to the placebo group at 20 and 10 minutes before the game (pre-20 and pre-10, respectively); and sC levels were significantly reduced in the treatment compared to the placebo group at 10 minutes before the game (p&lt;.05). CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrate that L-theanine treatment is an efficacious intervention for reducing cognitive anxiety, sAA, and sC levels in sports. Therefore, it is recommended to alleviate competitive anxiety in sports requiring high concentration levels such as archery."

      "abstract": "L-theanine, a non-protein amino acid naturally occurring in tea leaves, is recognized for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties. Despite its known benefits, the mechanisms by which L-theanine influences lifespan extension remain poorly understood. This study investigated the effects of L-theanine on the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans and explored the underlying mechanisms. Our findings indicate that L-theanine significantly diminishes the accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are biomarkers closely linked to aging and age-related diseases. Through an AGE-level analysis, we observed that L-theanine, when administered during early adulthood, notably extended the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans under both normal and high-glucose-induced stress conditions. L-theanine enhanced the lifespan under typical conditions and provided protective effects against high-glucose-induced stress. A further analysis demonstrated that L-theanine extends the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans by modulating the DAF-2/DAF-16 insulin-like signaling pathway and reducing the accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). In summary, this study identified L-theanine as a potential anti-aging intervention that extends the lifespan by reducing AGE accumulation and regulating insulin-like signaling pathways. These findings provide new insights for developing anti-aging strategies and lay the groundwork for further research on the potential benefits of L-theanine in mammals. Future studies could explore the molecular mechanisms, test L-theanine in mammalian models, and assess the long-term side effects."

This study explores the pro-angiogenic effects of L-theanine and its underlying mechanisms in a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia (HLI). To evaluate L-theanine's pro-angiogenic effects, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were subjected to tube formation, migration, sprouting, and proliferation assays. In vivo, C57BL/6 mice with induced HLI were treated with L-theanine. Blood flow recovery was measured via Doppler ultrasound, and vascular density was analyzed using immunofluorescence staining. RNA sequencing identified neuropilin-1 (NRP1) as a key regulator, and the expression levels of NRP1 and VEGFR2 were examined through qPCR and Western blotting. L-theanine significantly enhanced angiogenesis in HUVECs, as demonstrated by improved tube formation, migration, sprouting, and proliferation. In mice, L-theanine treatment resulted in increased vessel density and improved blood flow recovery. Furthermore, L-theanine was found to activate the NRP1/VEGFR2 signaling pathway in both HUVECs and the HLI mouse model. These findings indicate that L-theanine can promote angiogenesis and activate key pathways involved in vascular repair, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for treating vascular defects associated with PAD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Drug-induced kidney damage (DIKD) is a significant medical concern linked to many drugs, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and chemotherapy agents, due to its complex pathophysiology. L-theanine, a tea leaf amino acid, is explored for its protective effects against DIKD, considering its cognitive and calming benefits. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the theoretical part of the article, the role of L-theanine in combating DIKD is reviewed, highlighting its ability to mitigate oxidative stress and inflammation by neutralizing reactive oxygen species, enhancing antioxidant defenses, and modulating anti-inflammatory pathways. L-theanine's influence on cell signaling and its synergy with other nephroprotective agents are discussed. The practical part describes an experimental study using a murine model, where 60 male C57BL/6 mice were divided into four groups: a control group, a nephrotoxic group treated with cisplatin, and two treatment groups that received L-theanine either before or after cisplatin administration. Serum biomarkers (creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)), histopathological kidney damage scores, and oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)) were measured. RESULTS: Evidence from the murine study indicates that L-theanine protects against DIKD through antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic mechanisms, potentially enhancing its synergy with other nephroprotective agents. In the nephrotoxic group (N), serum creatinine and BUN levels were significantly elevated, while pre-treatment with L-theanine (LTP) reduced these levels to 1.2 ± 0.3 mg/dL and 34 ± 4 mg/dL, respectively. Histopathological analysis revealed severe tubular necrosis in the N group (score: 3.8 ± 0.3), which was significantly reduced in the LTP group (1.6 ± 0.4). Oxidative stress markers, such as MDA, were markedly lowered in the LTP group compared to the N group, with corresponding increases in SOD activity, indicating enhanced antioxidant defense. These findings underscore L-theanine's potential in preserving renal health amidst pharmacotherapy-induced toxicity. CONCLUSION: L-theanine emerges as a promising nephroprotective agent, particularly in the context of increasing incidence of DIKD and the associated challenges in clinical management. The practical findings from this study in a murine model provide compelling evidence that L-theanine significantly reduces serum biomarkers of renal injury, attenuates tubular necrosis, and mitigates oxidative stress, with pronounced effects observed when administered as a pre-treatment. While these results are promising, the predominance of preclinical data underscores the need for rigorous human studies to validate L-theanine's efficacy and safety in the prevention of drug-related renal injuries. Such research is crucial for advancing renal protection strategies in pharmacotherapy.",

      "abstract": "This study examines the impact of the combination of sitagliptin and L-theanine on the testis tissue of rats with experimental diabetes. Diabetes mellitus, a chronic metabolic illness, significantly reduces quality of life and can cause male infertility by decreasing sperm count, motility, and testosterone levels. Rats were allocated to five separate groups: control, diabetes, L-theanine, sitagliptin, and combination therapy. The measurements encompassed blood glucose levels, body weight, serum insulin levels, and the Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). The histological examination of testicular tissue was conducted using H&E, PASH, caspase-12, and PCNA staining techniques, in addition to a TUNEL assay to detect apoptosis. Levels of oxidative stress indicators, including glutathione peroxidase (GPX), malondialdehyde (MDA), and catalase, were also evaluated. The results showed that the group of individuals with diabetes had significantly higher levels of blood glucose, apoptotic indices, GPX, catalase, and MDA levels and activities in comparison with the control group. Although both the L-theanine and sitagliptin groups exhibited some improvement, the combination therapy demonstrated the most significant decrease in histopathological damage and apoptotic markers. These results indicate that the combination of sitagliptin and L-theanine may significantly decrease testicular damage caused by diabetes, making it a promising therapeutic strategy.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is a major public health concern globally. Plant-based ingredients have been proposed as alternative treatments for obesity. L-Theanine (THE), a unique nutraceutical component of tea, is known for its neuroprotective and cognitive benefits. However, there are few reports on THE's effects and mechanisms in improving obesity and its complications. In this study, the alleviating effects and potential mechanisms of THE on obesity-related complications (ORCs) induced by a high-fat diet(HFD) in mice were explored by performing biochemical, hepatic transcriptomics, and plasma metabolomics analyses. The results indicated THE (900 mg/kg of body weight) was effective in mitigating ORCs by decreasing body weight gain and fat deposition, improving glycolipid metabolism disorders, inflammation dysregulation, and alleviating fatty liver formation due to long-term HFD. The hepatic transcriptomics data suggested that THE intervention suppresses the lipid metabolism and inflammation pathways in HFD-fed mice, thereby inhibiting hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Moreover, plasma metabolomics analysis revealed that THE exhibited positive effects on the homeostasis of plasma metabolite balance, such as phosphatidylcholine (PC(14:0/18:1)), phosphatidylethanolamine (Lyso-PE(14:0)), phosphatidic acid (PA(16:0e/18:0)), stigmasterol, and deoxycholic acid glycine conjugate. These metabolites were strongly correlated with ORC-related indicators. Our results indicated that THE, as a functional food additive, possesses potential for ORC alleviation. However, the exact molecular mechanism of how THE alleviates ORCs needs to be investigated in the future."

Gray mold caused by Botrytis cinerea is a major disease in strawberries. Effects of theanine on the development of gray mold, cell-wall and phenylpropanoid metabolisms in strawberries were investigated in this study. Results showed that 5 mmol L-1 theanine treatment reduced disease incidence and severity of gray mold in strawberries with antifungal activity in vitro. Meanwhile, theanine treatment enhanced the accumulation of phenolic compounds and lignin, especially ellagic acid, cyanidin, and quercetin, which was associated with increased phenylpropanoid pathway related enzyme activities. Moreover, theanine induced callose deposition and suppressed cell- wall disassembling enzymes, accompanied by higher levels of water insoluble pectin, hemicellulose and cellulose. Therefore, theanine treatment could alleviate decay of B. cinerea-inoculated strawberries by regulating phenylpropanoid and cell-wall metabolisms, maintaining higher levels of phenolic compounds and cell-wall components, thereby contributing to disease resistance and cell-wall structure integrity."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: L-theanine is a non-protein-forming amino acid found in tea. Limited evidence suggests that it improves selective attention. Sleep deprivation impairs attention and psychomotor reactions, affecting automobile driving. We aimed to determine whether L-theanine improves neurobehavioral measures of visual attention in acutely sleep-deprived healthy adults in a traffic-scene-based attention task. METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced, two-way crossover study, we compared the effects of a 200-mg dose of L-theanine with a placebo (150 ml of distilled water) on a computerised, traffic-scene-based visual recognition reaction task in 24 healthy volunteers (age 20-25 years; 13 males) sleep-deprived overnight. The participants made speeded button-presses to imminent accident scenes (i.e. hits), while ignoring safe scenes. They were tested pre-dose and 45 min post-dose, each treatment administered one week apart. RESULTS: Hit rates were more than 90% in all sessions, and were similar in two treatments, pre- vs post-dose. L-theanine significantly reduced false alarms (i.e. responses to safe scenes) (p = 0.014) and increased A' (i.e. target-distractor discriminability) (p = 0.009), whereas placebo did not (p > 0.05). L-theanine reduced hit reaction time by 38.65 ms (p = 0.007), and placebo by 19.08 ms (p = 0.016), however reaction time changes from baseline were not significantly different between treatments (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: L-theanine in high doses appears to improve selective visual attention by concurrently improving information processing speed and target-distractor discriminability in acutely sleep-deprived individuals. This is consistent with previous functional neuroimaging findings, where L-theanine suppressed distractor-processing and default-mode-network activity in visual selective attention tasks.",

However, there have been no studies to concurrently examine the impact of both L-theanine and L-tyrosine ingestion during a mental stress challenge (MSC) involving a brief cognitive challenge and a virtual reality based active shooter training drill. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the impact of ingestion of L-theanine and L-tyrosine on markers of stress and cognitive performance in response to a virtual reality active shooter drill and cognitive challenge. The cognitive challenge involved a Stroop challenge and mental arithmetic. Eighty subjects (age = 21 ± 2.6 yrs; male = 46; female = 34) were randomly assigned L-tyrosine (n = 28; 2000 mg), L-theanine (n = 25; 200 mg), or placebo (n = 27) prior to MSC exposure. Saliva samples, state-anxiety inventory (SAI) scales, and heart rate (HR) were collected before and after exposure to the MSC. Saliva was analyzed for stress markers α-amylase (sAA) and secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA). The MSC resulted in significant increases in sAA, SIgA, HR, and SAI. Ingestion of L-theanine and L-tyrosine did not impact markers of stress. However, the L-tyrosine treatment demonstrated significantly lower missed responses compared to the placebo treatment group during the Stroop challenge. These data demonstrate that ingestion of L-theanine or L-tyrosine does not impact markers of stress in response to a MSC but may impact cognitive performance.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The use of natural products for the treatment of sleep disturbances is increasing owing to the side effects and limitations of traditional sleep therapy. Moreover, recent studies have shown a significant correlation between sleep quality and gut microbiota composition. This study aimed to assess the impact of LTC-022, a commercially available dietary supplement containing Lactium and L-theanine, on enhancing sleep quality. METHODS: Forty participants experiencing sleep discomfort were enrolled in a double-blind randomized controlled trial, wherein they received LTC-022 or a placebo orally for 8 weeks. The effects of treatment on sleep quality were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Insomnia Severity Index. To comprehensively evaluate changes in sleep patterns, various parameters were evaluated, including the time in bed (TIB), total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency (SOL), sleep efficiency (SE), wake after sleep onset (WASO) counts, and bedtime. These parameters were derived from daily sleep logs recorded over the 8-week study period, categorized into weekdays and weekends. Stool samples were analyzed for microbiome composition. The V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes was amplified using specific primers (515F and 806R) and targeted for analysis. Microbial diversity, including operational taxonomic units, the Shannon and Chao indices, the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio, and the variety of bacterial taxa, was assessed. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in sleep quality and insomnia scale characteristics between the two groups. In-depth analysis using sleep diaries showed that WASO counts after 8 weeks and bedtime after 4 weeks showed significant differences between the LTC-022 and control groups. In the LTC-022 group, significant differences were observed in the increase in TST, decrease in SOL, increase in SE, decrease in WASO counts, and earlier bedtime. Microbiome analysis revealed that the abundance of the genera Blautia and Ruminococcus increased in fecal samples from the LTC-022 group. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that continuous LTC-022 intake has a beneficial effect on maintaining sleep duration and an appropriate bedtime. Additionally, changes in the gut microbiota may be linked to changes in sleep patterns resulting from the consumption of Lactium and L-theanine.

Previous studies have shown that L-theanine has many potent health benefits, such as anti-anxiety effects, regulation of the immune response, relaxing neural tension, and reducing oxidative damage. However, little is known concerning whether L-theanine can improve the clearance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage in organisms. Here, we reported that L-theanine treatment increased ATP production and improved mitochondrial morphology to extend the lifespan of UVC-exposed nematodes. Mechanistic investigations showed that L-theanine treatment enhanced the removal of mtDNA damage and extended lifespan by activating autophagy, mitophagy, mitochondrial dynamics, and mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) in UVC-exposed nematodes. In addition, L-theanine treatment also upregulated the expression of genes related to mitochondrial energy metabolism in UVC-exposed nematodes. Our study provides a theoretical basis for the possibility that tea drinking may prevent mitochondrial-related diseases.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic excessive alcohol consumption can lead to alcoholic fatty liver, posing substantial health risks. l-Theanine (LTA) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) in tea exert antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects. However, the combined effects of LTA and EGCG on rats with alcoholic fatty liver, and the underlying mechanisms of such effects, remain unclear. In this study, Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were fed with alcohol for 6 weeks to induce alcoholic fatty liver. Subsequently, for another 6 weeks, the rats were administered LTA (200 mg kg-1 day-1), EGCG (200 mg kg-1 day-1), or a combination of LTA with EGCG (40 mg kg-1 day-1 l-Thea +160 mg kg-1 day-1 EGCG), respectively. RESULTS: The combined use of LTA and EGCG for alcoholic fatty liver disease had more significant effects than their individual administration. This combination reduced the activity of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) as well as the levels of hepatic triglyceride (TG), malondialdehyde (MDA), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the rats. The combined intervention also increased hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase activity. Reductions in hepatic fat accumulation and inflammatory responses were observed. The mechanism underlying these effects primarily involved the inhibition of fatty acid synthesis and the alleviation of lipid peroxidation through the downregulation of the mRNA and protein expression of TNF-α, SREBP1c, and CYP2E1 and the upregulation of the mRNA and protein expression of ADH1, ALDH2, Lipin-1, PPARαPPARα, AMPK, and PGC-1α, thereby promoting the oxidative decomposition of fatty acids and reducing the synthesis of cholesterol and glucose. CONCLUSION: l-Theanine and EGCG appear to be able to alleviate alcoholic fatty liver by modulating lipid metabolism and ameliorating oxidative stress, indicating their potential as natural active ingredients in anti-alcoholic fatty liver food products. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

L-Theanine and dihydromyricetin have biological activities against heat stress; however, their effects on reproductive function in heat-stressed males are unclear. In this study, male mice were given L-theanine, dihydromyricetin, or a combination of both for 28 days, followed by 2 h of heat stress daily for 7 days. All interventions alleviated heat stress-induced testicular damage, improving the testicular organ index, sperm density, acrosome integrity, sperm deformity rate, and hormone levels. Treatment increased the antioxidant enzyme activity and decreased the markers of oxidative and inflammatory stress in the testes. A combination dose of 200 + 200 mg kg-1 d-1 showed the best protective effect. The potential mechanism involves the regulation of HSP27 and HSP70, which regulate the levels of reproductive hormones through the StAR/Cyp11a1/Hsd3b1/Cyp17a1/Hsd17b3 pathway, alleviate inflammation and oxidative stress through the P38/NF-κB/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, and regulate the Bcl-2/Fas/Caspase3 apoptotic pathway.

The secondary objective was to know the prevalence of insomnia in patients with cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study was conducted after obtaining Institutional Ethics Committee approval. One hundred and twenty patients were randomly assigned to either Group A (melatonin), Group B (L-theanine), or Group C (placebo). They were instructed to take the tablets for 14 consecutive days, two h (hours) before bedtime, and evaluated with AIS on the 1st day, 7th day, and 14th day. RESULTS: There were seven dropouts: Two in Group A, two in Group B, and three in Group C. Significant differences in favour of melatonin treatment were found. There were statistically significant improvements in insomnia in cancer patients on melatonin intake compared to L-theanine. L-theanine had statistically significant improvements in insomnia in comparison to placebo. The mean ± standard deviation AIS on day one in Group A was 14.82 ± 1.29; on day seven was 10.92 ± 1.12; and on day 14 was 5.00 ± 0.70. Similarly, in Group B, the mean ± standard deviation AIS was 15.39 ± 1.03, 13.05 ± 1.06, and 9.55 ± 1.01, and in Group C, the mean AIS was 14.92 ± 1.40, 14.54 ± 1.35 and 13.05 ± 1.61 on the 1st, 7th and 10th day, respectively. There was an improvement in sleep from 1 to 7 days, 7 days to 14 days, and 1 day to 14 days in all the groups (P < 0.005). CONCLUSION: The hypnotic efficacy of oral melatonin 3 mg was better than oral L-theanine 200 mg in cancer patients having insomnia. Furthermore, L-theanine had a better hypnotic efficacy when compared to a placebo."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Although several potential radioprotectants have been explored, radiation esophagitis is still difficult to control. Further development of supportive therapies is required. Our purpose was to investigate the efficacy and safety of cystine and theanine for esophagitis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy (CRT). METHODS: This study is a prospective observational study. The participants were recruited from unresectable locally advanced NSCLC who had scheduled to receive weekly paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel/carboplatin plus radiation therapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions) for 6 weeks. They took an oral amino acid supplement containing 700 mg cystine and 280 mg theanine once daily regardless of CRT timing from the start of CRT until completion. The primary endpoint was the incidence of any grade esophagitis. The secondary endpoints were quality of life (QoL) and adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: A total of 26 patients were evaluated. All participants completed 60 Gy of RT in 30 fractions. The overall incidence of esophagitis was 73%; however, no ≥ grade 3 was reported. There were no AEs likely to be related to cystine and theanine. The mean EuroQoL 5-Dimension 5-Level health index score before and after chemoradiotherapy was 0.952 ± 0.0591 and 0.952 ± 0.0515 (P = 0.89), and the mean Visual Analogue Scale scores before and after treatment were 67.9 ± 15.4 and 79.4 ± 13.2 (P = 0.0047), respectively. CONCLUSION: Our study showed no severe esophagitis, any AEs, nor QoL decrease in NSCLC patients receiving CRT. Cystine and theanine are potentially effective to reduce severe CRT-induced esophagitis.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Overactivation of receptors that respond to excitatory neurotransmitters can result in various harmful outcomes, such as the inability to properly modulate calcium levels, generation of free radicals, initiation of the mitochondrial permeability transition, and subsequent secondary damage caused by excitotoxicity. A non-proteinogenic amino acid of tea, L-theanine, is structurally related to glutamate, the major stimulatory neurotransmitter in the brain. Previous reports have emphasised its ability to bind with glutamate receptors. OBJECTIVE: An in-depth understanding of the binding compatibility between ionotropic glutamate receptors and L-theanine is a compelling necessity. METHODS: In this molecular docking study, the antagonistic effect of L-theanine and its possible therapeutic benefit in GluR5 kainate receptor inhibition has been evaluated and compared to the familiar AMPA and kainite receptor antagonists, cyanoquinoxaline (CNQX) and dinitroquinoxaline (DNQX), using Molegro Virtual Docker 7.0.0. RESULTS: The capacity of L-theanine to cohere with the GluR5 receptor was revealed to be higher than that of glutamate, although it could not surpass the high binding tendency of competitive antagonists CNQX and DNQX. Nonetheless, the drug-likeness score and the blood-brain barrier traversing potential of L-theanine were higher than CNQX and DNQX. CONCLUSION: The study provides an inference to the advantage of L-theanine, which can be a safe and effective alternative natural therapy for rescuing neuronal death due to excitotoxicity.",

      "abstract": "Tea grey blight disease is one of the most destructive diseases that infects tea and is caused by the pathogen Pestalotiopsis theae (Sawada) Steyaert. L-theanine is a unique non-protein amino acid of the tea plant. Different concentrations of L-theanine exhibit significant inhibitory effects on the growth and sporulation ability of the pathogen causing tea grey blight disease. To understand the effect mechanism of L-theanine on P. theae, transcriptome profiling was performed on the pathogenic mycelium treated with three different concentrations of L-theanine: no L-theanine treatment (TH0), 20 mg/mL theanine treatment (TH2), and 40 mg/mL theanine treatment (TH4). The colony growths were significantly lower in the treatment with L-theanine than those without L-theanine. The strain cultured with a high concentration of L-theanine produced no spores or only a few spores. In total, 2344, 3263, and 1158 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected by RNA-sequencing in the three comparisons, Th2 vs. Th0, Th4 vs. Th0, and Th4 vs. Th2, respectively. All DEGs were categorized into 24 distinct clusters. According to GO analysis, low concentrations of L-theanine primarily affected molecular functions, while high concentrations of L-theanine predominantly affected biological processes including external encapsulating structure organization, cell wall organization or biogenesis, and cellular amino acid metabolic process. Based on KEGG, the DEGs of Th2 vs. Th0 were primarily involved in pentose and glucuronate interconversions, histidine metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism. The DEGs of Th4 vs. Th0 were mainly involved in starch and sucrose metabolism, amino sugar, and nucleotide sugar metabolism. This study indicated that L-theanine has a significant impact on the growth and sporulation of the pathogen of tea grey blight disease and mainly affects amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and cellular structure-related biosynthesis processes of pathogenic fungi. This work provides insights into the direct control effect of L-theanine on pathogenic growth and also reveals the molecular mechanisms of inhibition of L-theanine to P. theae.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is experienced by many women who suffer from either its psychological or physical symptoms. Current treatment is limited to symptomatic therapy or oral contraceptives. On the other hand, l-theanine, which has a relaxant effect, has been reported to be useful for PMS, but its short half-life when administered orally makes it less effective. Permeability and properties of transdermal gel containing l-theanine were evaluated as a preclinical study of PMS symptoms relief formulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lyogel composed of stearic acid, stearyl alcohol, and propylene glycol was selected. The ratio of these components and the preparation method were investigated. Permeation of Strat-M membranes was evaluated by using Franz cells (in vitro). Moreover, lyogel was applied to institute of cancer research mice's backs for 10 days to examine the permeability of l-theanine. RESULTS: l-Theanine solution did not permeate the Strat-M membrane at all in the permeation study, but lyogel allowed l-theanine to permeate. When the composition of lyogel was 4.4:11.1:296 (mmol) for stearic acid, stearyl alcohol, and propylene glycol, l-theanine absorption through Strat-M membrane was better. In skin permeation study using mice, l-theanine was detected in the serum, that is, it was proven that l-theanine penetrated the skin. CONCLUSION: The preparation of transdermal gels contained l-theanine was investigated as a preclinical study. The skin permeability of semisolid formulations of hydrophobic ointments, hydrophilic ointments, oily creams, creams, and lyogel containing theanine was compared and found that lyogel was the best. The composition of lyogel was also studied to obtain a formulation with good application comfort. Although it is suggested that this lyogel could be tested in clinical studies to determine whether it is effective for relief of PMS symptoms, lyogel may be suitable as an easy-to-use l-theanine-containing formulation for women that can relieve PMS symptoms."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intestinal senescence is associated with several aging-related diseases. l-Theanine (LTA) has demonstrated strong potential as an antioxidant and antisenescence agent. This study investigated the regulatory effect of LTA on cellular senescence using an in vitro model of d-galactose (D-Gal)-induced senescence in the rat epithelial cell line, intestinal epithelioid cell-6 (IEC-6). RESULTS: Treatment of IEC-6 cells with 40 mg/mL D-Gal for 48 h resulted in the successful development of the senescent cell model. Compared with D-Gal alone, both LTA preventive and delayed intervention increased cell viability and the ratio of JC-1 monomers to aggregates, increased the antioxidant capacity, and decreased the advanced glycation end product (AGE) levels and the overall number of senescent cells. Preventive and delayed intervention with 1000 μM LTA alleviated the D-Gal-induced cell cycle arrest by regulating p38, p53, CDK4, and CDK6 expression at the mRNA and protein levels, and further induced CycD1 proteins. Moreover, LTA preventive intervention reduced apoptosis to a greater degree than delayed intervention by upregulating the expression of the receptors of AGEs, Bax, Bcl-2, and NF-κB at the mRNA and protein levels. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that LTA intervention could attenuate senescence in IEC-6 cells by regulating the cell cycle and inhibiting apoptosis. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",

To investigate this, we administered LTA doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg·kg-1 ·d-1 to C57BL/6J mice. On day 44, the model group and LTA intervention group were subjected to continuous 7-day HS treatment for 2 h per day. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that LTA intervention improved food intake, body weight, and intestinal epithelium, and reduced the water intake of heat-stressed mice. It increased the abundance of Turicibacter, Faecalibaculum, Bifidobacterium, and norank_f_Muribaculaceae, while reducing that of Lachnoclostridium and Desulfovibrio. LTA intervention also increased the concentrations of amino acid and lipid metabolites, regulated macrophage differentiation stimulated by gut microbiota and metabolites, reduced the antigen presentation by macrophages to the specific immune system, promoted B-cell differentiation and sIgA secretion, inhibited pro-inflammatory factors, and enhanced intestinal defense. Mechanistically, LTA downregulated heat shock protein 70 expression and the TLR4/NF-κB/p38 MAPK signaling pathway, restoring gut microbiota and immune balance. CONCLUSION: We suggest that LTA can alleviate HS by modulating gut microbiota, metabolites, and immunity, indicating its potential as a natural active ingredient for anti-HS food products. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Inadequate responses to current schizophrenia treatments have accelerated research into novel therapeutic approaches. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the efficacy and tolerability of adjunctive L-theanine, an ingredient with neuroimmunomodulatory and neuroprotective properties, for chronic schizophrenia. METHODS: Eighty chronic schizophrenia inpatients were equally assigned to receive risperidone (6 mg/day) plus either L-theanine (400 mg/day) or matched placebo in this 8-week, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The participants were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) by recording the results of subscales at baseline and weeks 4 and 8 to measure treatment efficacy. Additionally, the participants were assessed for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and adverse events, including the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS). RESULTS: Sixty patients, 30 in each group, were included in the analyses. All baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were comparable between the groups (p-values > 0.05). The reduction rates from baseline to endpoint in negative, general psychopathology, and total scores of PANSS were greater in the L-theanine group (p-values = 0.03, 0.01, and 0.04, respectively). Regarding general psychopathology scores, the reduction in the L-theanine group was also greater until week 4 (p-value < 0.01). The time × treatment interaction effect was significant on negative (p-value = 0.03), general psychopathology (p-value < 0.01), and total (p-value = 0.04) scores of PANSS, indicating additional improvements in the L-theanine group. The HDRS and side effects were comparable between the groups (p-values > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: L-Theanine adjunct to risperidone safely and tolerably outperformed adjunctive placebo for schizophrenia, and promising evidence indicated its effects on primary negative symptoms, which need to be scrutinized in further studies.

L-theanine can regulate the neurotransmitter content and show great potential in liver and brain protection. However, it remains unclear whether l-theanine effectively regulates neurotransmitter content under high-protein diet. A 40-day feeding experiment was performed in Sprague Dawley rats to investigate the regulatory effects and mechanisms of l-theanine on neurotransmitters via liver-brain axis in high-protein diets. The results showed that a 30% protein diet increased the liver and brain neurotransmitter content while maintaining the normal structure of liver and the hippocampal CA1 of brain and improving the autonomous behavior of rats. In contrast, 40% and 50% protein diets decreased the content of neurotransmitters, affected autonomous behavior, destroyed the hippocampal CA1 of brain structure, increased hepatic inflammatory infiltration, lipid degeneration, and hepatocyte eosinophilic change in liver, increased liver AST, ALT, MDA, CRP, and blood ammonia level, and decreased liver SOD and CAT level. However, l-theanine improved liver and brain neurotransmitter content, autonomous behavior, liver and hippocampal brain structure, and liver biochemical indicators in 40% and 50% protein diets. To explore how LTA can eliminate the adverse effects of a high-protein diet, we analyzed different metabolites and proteomes and using western blotting for validate quantitatively. We found that l-theanine regulates the activity of PF4 and G protein subunit alpha i2, increases the content of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and dopamine under a 20% protein diet. In addition, l-theanine can activate the adenylate cyclase-protein kinase A pathway through the protein alpha/beta-hydrolase domain protein 12 to regulate the content of neurotransmitters under a 40% protein diet, thereby exerting a neuroprotective effect.",

The caffeine group showed a significant increase in the WASO time compared with the placebo group; no difference was observed between the theanine or TC group and the placebo group. There were no differences in the sleep-onset latency or number of WASOs between the theanine, caffeine, or TC groups and the placebo group.

We previously reported that CT pre-treatment significantly improved the acute survival rate and reduced acute radiation injury of the small intestine and bone marrow of rats after 5 Gy of total body X-ray irradiation. To examine the long-term effects of CT administration after irradiation, we investigated the effects of CT pre-treatment and pre- and post-treatment on the chronic survival rate and solid tumor (spleen, skin and subcutis, and thyroid) incidence after irradiation using 7-week-old male Wistar rats. CT pre-treatment of 280 mg/kg was administered orally for 5 days before 5 Gy irradiation, and CT pre- and post-treatment was administered 5 days before and 5 days after irradiation. A 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose solution was administered as a control. The chronic survival rate of the pre-treated rats was higher than that of the control rats at 441 days after irradiation (40 vs 8.1%, P = 0.011). However, the survival rate did not significantly differ between the pre- and post-treatment and control rats at 467 days after irradiation (33.8 vs 30.2%, P = 0.792). In addition, more solid tumors, especially subcutis sarcomas, were observed in the pre-treatment rats (26.1%, 6/23) than in the control rats (4.5%, 1/22) after irradiation. Therefore, pre-administration of CT improves the chronic survival rate after irradiation; however, the occurrence of solid tumors was not suppressed.",

In group 3, mice were fed a regular diet and administered p.o. with L-theanine (50mg/kg). In group 4, mice received a diet containing CPZ and were administered p.o. with L-theanine (50mg/kg). Finally, reflexive motor behavior and serum antioxidant levels were determined. Based on findings, CPZ significantly decreased ambulation score, hind-limb suspension, front limb suspension, and grip strength (P<0.05). The CPZ + L-theanine reduced the adverse effect of the CPZ on ambulation score, hind-limb foot angle, surface righting, and negative geotaxis (P<0.05). The CPZ + L-theanine increased front and hind-limb suspension, grip strength, number of the cross, and duration of a stay on the rotarod compared to the control animal (P<0.05). CPZ administration significantly elevated serum malondialdehyde (MDA) while superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and total antioxidant status (TAS) levels decreased compared to control mice (P<0.05). The CPZ + L-theanine leads to the cessation of MDA production while increasing SOD, GPx, and TAS levels (P<0.05). These results suggested L-theanine has a protective effect against CPZ-induced MS in mice.",

Model thermal reactions of total amino acids and sugars with different roasting conditions (low-fire, middle-fire, and high-fire) showed theanine competitively inhibited the formation of indole, skatole, 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone, and Strecker aldehydes, while greatly stimulated the production of roasty pyrazines. In addition, highest amounts of pyrazines were obtained under high-fire degree. Quantification of these reaction products in Wuyi rock tea (WRT) was realized in different roasted Dahongpao teas by means of sensomics approach. The quantitative data revealed the biggest influence of roasting temperatures on the formation of reaction products among indole, lipid oxidation products, and pyrazines, while other reaction products were only slightly affected. The findings of this study provide a fresh perspective on the impact of theanine on aroma formation during the roasting process, which will help to explore the formation of key odorants during tea production.",

In the present study, the aim was to identify the effects LTN on the levels of BDNF, insulin and adipocytokines (TNF-α, leptin, adiponectin and resistin) in both HP and serum of diabetic rats. METHODS: 32 male Wistar rats were divided into four groups (n = 8/group): Control, LTN, DM and DM + LTN. Diabetes was induced by by nicotinamide/streptozotocin. 200 mg/kg/day LTN treatment was applied for 28 days. The serum and hippocampal levels of the parameters were determined by using commercial ELISA kits. Additionally, HP tissues examined histopathologically. RESULTS: LTN treatment significantly decreased leptin and adiponectin levels in HP tissues in diabetic rats (p < 0.05). Although it decreased the insulin level in both serum and HP, this was not statistically significant. No significant effect on other parameters was observed (p > 0.05). In histopathological analysis, although the damage was reduced by LTN in all sections of HP, this change was significant mainly in CA3 region (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: It was concluded that LTN has the ability to reduce hippocampal degeneration and modulates adipocytokines in diabetic rats.",

Several tea components have been studied for their impact on male fertility, but little is known about the effects of l-theanine. Cyclophosphamide (CP) is an antineoplastic and immunosuppressive agent that reduces fertility in males. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of l-theanine on CP-induced testicular toxicity in male mice. A single dosage of 50 mg/kg saline or CP was administered intraperitoneally over the course of 5 days. Mice were administered l-theanine (80 mg/kg) or saline by gavage for 30 days. Animals were euthanized 24 h after the last l-theanine administration, and the testes were removed for histopathological and transmission electron microscopy analysis. Histological evaluation and transmission electron microscopy showed that administration of l-theanine alleviated CP-induced damage to the testicles, including spermatogonial cells, epithelial cells, seminiferous tubules, and basement membrane. An integrated proteomics and metabolomics investigation of testes revealed that l-theanine therapy substantially affected the quantity of 719 proteins (395 upregulated and 324 downregulated) and 196 metabolites (75 upregulated and 111 downregulated). The top three enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways for these proteins and metabolites were purine metabolism, choline metabolism in cancer, and arachidonic acid metabolism. This is the first study to reveal the protective effect of l-theanine on CP-induced testicular toxicity. l-Theanine could be a potential natural active substance for resistance to the testis toxicity induced by CP.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons. The pathogenesis of PD includes oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neurotransmitter dysregulation. L-theanine is found in green tea and has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects with a high blood brain barrier permeability. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the possible neuroprotective effect of L-theanine in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced motor deficits and striatal neurotoxicity in a rat model of PD. METHODS: LPS was infused at a dose of 5 μg/5 μl PBS stereotaxically into SNpc of rats. Treatment with L-theanine (50 and 100 mg/kg; po) and Sinemet (36 mg/kg; po) was given from day 7 to 21 in of LPS injected rat. On a weekly basis all behavioral parameters were assessed, and animals were sacrificed on day 22. The striatum tissue of brain was isolated for biochemicals (Nitrite, GSH, catalase, SOD, mitochondrial complexes I and IV), neuroinflammatory markers, and neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, GABA, and glutamate) estimations. RESULTS: Results revealed that L-theanine dose-dependently and significantly reversed motor deficits, assessed through locomotor and rotarod activity. Moreover, L-theanine attenuated biochemical markers, reduced oxidative stress, and neurotransmitters dysbalance in the brain. L-theanine treatment at 100 mg/kg; po substantially reduced these pathogenic events by increasing mitochondrial activity, restoring neurotransmitter levels, and inhibiting neuroinflammation. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the positive effects of L-theanine on motor coordination may be mediated by the suppression of NF-κB induced by LPS. Therefore, L-theanine would have a new therapeutic potential for PD.",

METHODS: Patients from either sex aged between 18 and 60 years diagnosed with OCD, based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), who had a Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) score of more than 21 were enrolled in a double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of 10 weeks to receive either L-theanine (100 mg twice daily) and fluvoxamine (100 mg daily initially followed by 200 mg daily after week 5) or placebo and fluvoxamine. The primary outcome of interest in this study was the Y-BOCS total score decrease from baseline. RESULTS: From a total of 95 evaluated patients, 50 completed our study; 30 were randomly assigned to each group. Multivariate analysis (ANOVA) showed a significant effect of time  × $$ \\times $$  treatment for L-theanine in obsession subscale (F = 5.51, P = 0.008) of the Y-BOCS score but not in the total and compulsion scores. Our results showed significantly more improvement in obsession subscale scores in L-theanine compared to placebo group (P = 0.007, Cohen's d = 0.82). Also, total Y-BOCS scores were lower in L-theanine compared to placebo group at week 5 (P = 0.039, Cohen's d = 0.60) and 10 (P = 0.008, Cohen's d = 0.80). However, there was no significant between-group differences in compulsion subscale scores. Complete response was also more frequent in the L-theanine group (P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Findings in this study suggest L-theanine as a relatively safe and effective adjuvant therapy for moderate to severe OCD.",

To induce peripheral neuropathy, rats were administered VCR at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally on days 1-5 and 8-12, while control rats received LT at doses of 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally for 21 days or saline solution. Electrophysiological measurements were taken to evaluate the nerve functional loss and recovery through motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities. The sciatic nerve was examined for several biomarkers, including nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), total calcium, IL-6, IL-10, MPO, and caspase-3. The results showed that VCR caused significant hyperalgesia and allodynia in rats; decreased nerve conduction velocity; increased NO and MDA levels; and decreased GSH, SOD, CAT, and IL-10 levels. LT was found to significantly reduce VCR-induced nociceptive pain thresholds, decrease oxidative stress levels (NO, MDA), increase antioxidative strength (GSH, SOD, CAT), and reduce neuroinflammatory activity and apoptosis markers (caspase-3). LT's antioxidant, calcium homeostasis, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and neuroprotective properties make it a potential adjuvant to conventional treatment in VCR-induced neuropathy in rats."

Furthermore, L-theanine induces anxiolytic effects in humans. Recently, L-theanine was reported to reduce morphine physical dependence in primates, suggesting the potential usefulness of L-theanine for drug dependence intervention. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine whether L-theanine attenuates nicotine-withdrawal (somatic and affective signs) and nicotine reward in mice. We also investigated the effects of L-theanine on nicotinic receptors binding and function. METHODS: ICR male mice rendered dependent to nicotine through implanted subcutaneous osmotic minipumps for 14 days undertook precipitated nicotine withdrawal by mecamylamine on day 15. Anxiety-like behaviors using LDB, somatic signs observation and hot plate latency were assessed consecutively after treatment with L-theanine. Furthermore, we examined the effect of L-theanine on acute nicotine responses and nicotine conditioned reward in mice and on expressed nicotinic receptors in oocytes. KEY FINDINGS: L-theanine reduced in a dose-dependent manner anxiety-like behavior, hyperalgesia and somatic signs during nicotine withdrawal. Also, L-theanine decreased the nicotine CPP, but it did not affect the acute responses of nicotine. Finally, L-theanine did not alter the binding or the function of expressed α4β2 and α7 nAChRs. CONCLUSION: Our results support the potential of L-theanine as a promising candidate for treating nicotine dependence.",

This study sought to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of adjunctive l-theanine, a green tea constituent with neuropsychotropic effects, for MDD. METHODS: Sixty MDD (DSM-5) patients were equally assigned to receive sertraline (100 mg/d) plus either l-theanine (200 mg/d) or matched placebo in a six-week randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The participants were assessed using the Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS) at baseline and weeks 2, 4, and 6. Changes in scores, early improvement, response and remission rates, and adverse events were compared between the groups. RESULTS: Twenty-five participants in each group, a total of 50 patients, completed the study. All baseline characteristics were similar between the groups. The general linear model repeated-measures analysis demonstrated a significant time-treatment interaction effect for HDRS during the trial (p-value = 0.014), indicating more remarkable symptom improvement in the l-theanine group. A greater reduction in HDRS scores was observed in the l-theanine group from baseline to weeks 2, 4, and 6 (p-values = 0.02, 0.03, and 0.01, respectively). All patients responded to sertraline plus l-theanine until week 6. l-theanine was superior to placebo regarding response to treatment and remission rates at week 6 (p-values = 0.05 and 0.02, respectively). The frequency of side effects was comparable between the groups. LIMITATIONS: The small sample size and short study period were the limitations. CONCLUSIONS: l-theanine adjunct to sertraline outperforms placebo in treating MDD in a safe manner. Further long-term, large-scale studies are recommended to confirm this evidence.",

However, whether l-theanine has an excellent preventive effect on depression in children and adolescents and what its mechanism is have not been well explained. Given the complexity of the pathogenesis of depression, this study investigated the preventive effect and mechanism of l-theanine on depression in juvenile rats by combining serum and hippocampal metabolomic strategies. Behavioral tests, hippocampal tissue sections, and serum and hippocampal biochemical indexes were studied, and the results confirmed the preventive effect of l-theanine. Untargeted reversed-phase liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and targeted hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry were developed to analyze the metabolism changes in the serum and hippocampus to screen for potential biomarkers related to l-theanine treatment. The results suggested that 28 abnormal metabolites in the serum and hippocampus that were considered as potential biomarkers returned to near-normal levels after l-theanine administration. These biomarkers were involved in various metabolic pathways, mainly including amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism. The levels of amino acids and neurotransmitters in the phenylalanine, tryptophan, and glutamic acid pathways were significantly reduced after l-theanine administration compared with chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced rats. In summary, l-theanine had a significant preventive effect on depression and achieved its preventive results on depression by regulating various aspects of the body, such as amino acids, lipids, and inflammation. This research systematically analyzed the mechanism of l-theanine in preventing depression and laid the foundation for applying l-theanine to prevent depression in children and adolescents."

MLEO LTA + EGCG (20 mg kg-1 d-1 LTA + 80 mg kg-1 d-1 EGCG) and HLEO (30 mg kg-1 d-1 LTA + 120 mg kg-1 d-1 EGCG) exerted more beneficial effects on alleviating OVA-A (weight gain, allergy score, jejunum structure, mast cell [MC] degranulation, thymus and spleen indices) than LTA or EGCG alone (p < 0.01). Based on the alleviation of OVA-A by LTA + EGCG, we selected MLEO mice for 16S rDNA, flow cytometry, and western blot analyses. The 16S rDNA results showed that MLEO increased the abundance of Lactobacillaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae, and decreased that of Helicobacteraceae (p < 0.01). The flow cytometry and western blotting results indicated that MLEO reduced the number of dendritic cells available to capture OVA, thereby lowering the Th2 immune response and decreasing the IL-4 and IL-13 levels. Meanwhile, the attenuation of the Th2 immune response inhibits the cross-linking of OVA and FcεRI, thus reducing MC degranulation and decreasing the serum HIS and mMCPT-1 levels through the FcεRI/Btk/PLCγ signaling pathway. LTA + EGCG also inhibits the Th2 immune response through the FcεRI/Lyn/Syk/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and decreases the serum IL-4 and IL-13 levels. Notably, LTA + EGCG promotes the Treg and Th1 immune responses and inhibits the Th17 immune response, altering the levels of the corresponding cytokines. Therefore, LTA + EGCG can synergistically alleviate OVA-A by regulating intestinal immunity through MC degranulation inhibition.",

      "abstract": "With the current trend of global warming, heat stress-induced impairment could seriously endanger human health. L-Theanine is a non-protein amino acid in tea with various biological activities, including immunoregulatory, anti-anxiety, and anti-oxidation. However, its effect on immune function under heat stress and the underlying mechanism are currently unclear. In this study, male BALB/c mice were used as experimental objects to explore the effect of L-theanine on heat stress-induced changes in immune function and its mechanism. Three doses of L-theanine were used: low (100 mg kg-1 d-1), medium (200 mg kg-1 d-1), and high (400 mg kg-1 d-1). Treatment with L-theanine could attenuate the heat stress-induced reductions in body weight and feed intake in mice, alleviate damage in the liver and jejunum, and inhibit the inflammatory factors IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α. Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine transaminase activity levels and the malondialdehyde content decreased, while the IgA, IgM, and IgG contents increased in response to L-theanine. It is possible that L-theanine affects the P38 signalling pathway and inhibits the increase in p-P65/P65 caused by the overexpression of HSP27 and regulation of PPAR-γ and Foxp3 proteins, thereby alleviating immune dysfunction caused by heat stress.",

We treated MPTP-induced SH-SY5Y cells with various concentrations of L-theanine (50, 100, 200, and 500 μg/mL), and we also treated Parkinson's model mice with L-theanine. L-theanine treatment effectively reduced the immunohistochemical hallmarks of Parkinson's disease, particularly Lewy bodies and α-synuclein, and increased the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells. L-theanine also improved the motor dysfunction in MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease model mice as measured by the rotarod test. The levels of several pro-inflammatory mediators that are overexpressed in Parkinson's disease, namely TNF-α, IL-6, COX-2, and MAC-1, were reduced following L-theanine treatment, and the levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, caspase-3, p53, and PARP-1 were significantly reduced. L-theanine regulated the oxidative stress-related factors SOD-1, GST, and NOX-4 by targeting several proteins related to WNT/β-catenin signaling, i.e., β-catenin, WNT-3a, WNT-5a, TCF1/TCF7, and LEF1, via the MAPK pathway (p-JNK, p-ERK, and p-p38). Our results indicate that L-theanine is neuroprotective and has anti-inflammatory effects that could be beneficial for treating Parkinson's disease.",

However, it is unknown whether it regulates protein metabolism in individuals on high-protein diets (HPDs). METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, Sprague-Dawley rats are fed HPDs with different protein supply ratios and administered a diverse dose of LTA for 40 days. Results show that HPDs with an energy supply ratio from protein >40% impair the liver and kidneys, elevate serum ammonia and urea nitrogen, induce amino acid (AA) catabolism, and promote fatty acid (FA) synthesis via FA-binding protein 5 (Fabp5) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1). LTA intervention alleviates HPD-induced hepatic and renal injury and improves serum biochemical indices. It increases hepatic free AA content and inhibits FA synthesis by downregulating Fabp5 and ACC1. It promotes protein synthesis by acting on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, thereby alleviating HPD-induced metabolic disorders. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that LTA mitigates kidney and liver damage induced by long-term excess HPDs by regulating protein metabolism.",

      "abstract": "Ovalbumin (OVA), a common food protein, can cause deadly allergies with intestine-specific immune reactions. L-Theanine (LTA) shows great potential for regulating intestinal immunity. To investigate the regulatory effect of LTA intervention on intestine-specific immunity, a 41 day experiment was performed on BALB/c OVA-sensitized mice. The results show that injecting female mice intraperitoneally with 50 μg of OVA and administering 30 mg of OVA 4 times can successfully establish an OVA-sensitized mouse model. LTA intervention significantly increased weight gain and thymus index (p < 0.05), decreased allergy and diarrhea scores (p < 0.05), and improved jejunum structure. Meanwhile, the histological score and degranulation of mast cells decreased. LTA intervention increased Clostridiales, Lachnospiraceae, Lactobacillus, Prevotella, and Ruminococcus abundance while decreasing Helicobacter abundance. Flow cytometry and Western blotting results indicated that 200 and 400 mg/kg of LTA upregulated the expression of T-bet and Foxp3 proteins (p < 0.05), thus promoting the differentiation of jejunum CD4+ T cells to Th1 and Tregs and increasing the cytokines IFN-γ, IL-10, and TGF-β (p < 0.05). We found that 200 and 400 mg/kg of LTA downregulated the expression of RORγt and GATA3, thus inhibiting the differentiation of Th2 and Th17 cells and decreasing cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-17A (p < 0.05). LTA inhibited the degranulation of mast cells and significantly decreased the serum levels of OVA-IgE, HIS, and mouse MCPT-1 (p < 0.05). Therefore, LTA intervention alleviated OVA allergy by improving intestine-specific immunity.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary L-theanine supplementation on apparent nutrient digestibility, milk yield, milk composition, and blood biochemical indices of dairy cows under heat stress. Thirty Chinese Holstein cows (19.84 ± 2.42 kg milk/d, 192.36 ± 40.77 d in milk and 2 ± 0.93 parities) were divided into 3 groups of 10 animals each. The control group was fed a basal total mixed ration (TMR) diet, while treatment 1 (LTA16) and treatment 2 (LTA32) groups were fed a basal TMR diet supplemented with L-theanine at 16 and 32 g/cow per day, respectively. The results showed that feeding the dairy cows with LTA16 treatment decreased (P < 0.05) their rectal temperature, whereas feeding with LTA32 treatment decreased (P < 0.05) their rumen fluid ammonia nitrogen content. In comparison to the control group, the supplementation of L-theanine had no significant effect (P > 0.05) on the dry matter intake, nutrient digestibility, total volatile fatty acid (TVFA) concentration and molar proportion of volatile fatty acid, milk yield, milk composition, feed efficiency and antioxidant capacity of the dairy cows. The triglyceride (TG) content of the LTA32 group was significantly greater (P = 0.014) than that of the control group. With the increase in L-theanine dosage, the serum cholesterol (CHOL) content significantly increased (P = 0.013). The serum albumin (ALB; P = 0.067), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; P = 0.053), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C; P = 0.067) contents showed an upward trend as L-theanine dosage increased. Ultimately, the results of this study show that supplementing dairy cow diet with L-theanine could decrease dairy cow rectal temperature, affect lipid metabolism, and potentially relieve the heat stress of dairy cows to some extent."

Theanine is a unique amino acid found in green tea and could confer beneficial effects on cell protection. This study investigates if protective effect on the liver by stem cells preincubated with theanine is better than that from stem cells without preincubated theanine. METHODS: We transplanted theanine preincubated adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC) to male Wistar rats with liver dysfunction induced by N-nitrosodiethylamine. The viability, migration and antioxidant capabilities were performed in the ADSC pre-incubated with theanine. Hepatic functional, structural and molecular assays were determined in the animals with or without theanine preincubated ADSC. KEY FINDINGS: Cell model revealed that ADSC preincubated with green tea theanine (T-ADSC) increased cell capabilities including viability, migration and paracrine secretion. In vivo results indicated that several pathological conditions were observed in rats with liver injury induced by DEN including structural changes and expression of pyroptosis as well as autophagy markers. The above pathological conditions were improved when the rats received both ADSC and T-ADSC treatment. Furthermore, T-ADSC showed better therapeutic effect on rats with liver injury than ADSC due to significant suppression of pyroptosis markers caspase-1 and IL-1β as well as autophagy marker LC3-II accompanied with intensive paracrine VEGF from T-ADSC. SIGNIFICANCE: Increased paracrine VEGF secretion from T-ADSC plays a crucial role in liver regeneration. A future clinical study may be designed for further verification of these experimental in vivo findings.",

Bile acids (BA), an important end-product of cholesterol catabolism, participate in the regulation of lipid metabolism and gut microbiota. Here, we investigated the effect of LTA on lipid metabolism and the mechanism by which it regulates BA metabolism and gut microbiota. Male BALB/c mice were treated with LTA for 28 days. RESULTS: Daily LTA doses of 100 and 300 mg kg-1  d-1 altered the gut microbiota in mice, predominantly by decreasing Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Bacteroides, Clostridium and Enterorhabdus microbes associated with bile-salt hydrolase (BSH) activity, thereby decreasing the activity of BSH and increasing the levels of ileum conjugated BA (such as glycocholic acid (GCA) and lithocholic acid), thereby inhibiting the intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) signaling pathway. Inhibition of FXR-FGF15 signaling was accompanied by upregulation of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) mRNA and protein expression and increased hepatic production of cholic acid, deoxycholic acid, GCA, glycine cholic acid and glycine ursodeoxycholic acid. Meanwhile, increasing hepatic unconjugated BA upregulated the mRNA and protein expression of liver 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and downregulated the mRNA and protein expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1, liver low-density lipoprotein receptor and type B scavenger receptor. Therefore, the serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides decreased. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that LTA regulates lipid metabolism by modulating the gut microbiota and BA metabolism via the FXR-FGF15-CYP7A1 pathway. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Cell therapy topics are receiving increasingly more attention. The therapeutic applications of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have become one of the most discussed issues. While other stem cells have therapeutic effects, they have only one or two clinical applications. MSCs are responsible for repairing a variety of tissue injuries. Moreover, MSCs could be derived from several sources, including adipose tissue. MSCs are usually more abundant and easier to obtain compared to other stem cells. METHODS: To prove the concept that MSCs have homing ability to the injured tissue and assist in tissue repair, we examined the effects of intravenous injected adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) in a N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN)-induced liver injury rat model. RESULTS: The significant repairing ability of ADSCs was observed. The levels of fibrosis, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis in the DEN-injured liver tissues all decreased after ADSC treatment. Furthermore, to enhance the therapeutic effects of ADSCs, we pretreated them with L-theanine, which promotes the hepatocyte growth factor secretion of ADSC, and therefore improved the healing effects on injured liver tissue. CONCLUSION: ADSCs, especially L-theanine-pretreated ADSCs, have anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, and anti-tumorigenesis effects on the N-nitrosodiethylamine-induced liver injury rat model.",

For treating depression, antidepressants are used with minimal clinical evidence data and uncertain efficacy in children. L-theanine has anti-depression and other physiological functions. However, few reports are available on the pharmacokinetics of L-theanine, especially in children and adolescents. In this study, a rapid and sensitive hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was established and validated for the quantification of L-theanine in juvenile rat plasma and tissues. Chromatographic separation was conducted via an Agilent ZORBAX HILIC plus column in gradient elution mode. L-theanine and [2H5]-L-glutamic acid (internal standard) were determined under the multi-reaction monitoring mode transitions of m/z 175.0 → 157.9 and m/z 153.0 → 88.2 in positive ionisation mode, respectively, and completed methodology verification. In addition, 10 and 35 mg kg-1 of L-theanine were given by intragastric administration to determine the brain and plasma pharmacokinetic characteristics in healthy and chronic unpredictable mild stress rats, respectively. The distribution of tissues and the limbic system were measured at the same time. The results showed that juvenile and diseased rats have higher absorption than adult rats, and age, dosage and health status could affect the process of L-theanine in vivo. L-theanine also has a high degree of tissue distribution. This study lays a foundation for the clinical treatment of depression in children and adolescents.",

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of supplementation of both L-Theanine and Vitamin B6 in reducing tics and co-occurring disorders in a sample of youth with chronic tic disorder (CTD) or Tourette syndrome with anxiety symptoms. DESIGN: A open-label trial. Patients affected by Tourette syndrome were randomized to receive nutritional supplements based on L-Theanine and vitamin B6, or psychoeducation (PE). PARTICIPANTS: 34 children (30 boys and 4 girls) aged between 4 and 17 years affected by Tourette syndrome or chronic tic disorder, associated with anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: Patients in both groups showed a reduction in the severity of tic and anxiety symptoms. Supplementation with L-Theanine and vitamin B6 was significantly more effective than psychoeducation in reducing tics and co-occurring disorders, as measured by neuropsychological findings. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation of both L-Theanine and Vitamin B6 may help in the treatment of tic disorders associated with anxious symptoms. Between-group differences in clinician-rated severity did reach statistical significance only for tics. Despite this finding, further placebo-controlled trials are needed.",

In this study, a heat stress mouse model was used to evaluate the anti-heat stress effect of L-theanine and its possible mechanism of action. Mice subjected to heat stress (40 °C) that were administered L-theanine at various doses (100, 200, and 400 mg kg-1 d-1) had reduced oxidative stress and inflammatory factors when L-theanine was administered both long-term and as a preventative treatment. Our L-theanine intervention countered the reduction in growth and feed intake of mice under heat stress and reversed liver and jejunum tissue damage. Moreover, L-theanine countered the increase in inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β and antioxidant enzymes SOD and CAT; it also counteracted GSH-Px inactivation, the upregulation of AST and ALT enzyme activity, and MDA production. The mechanism of action may involve mediation of the P38 signaling pathway, inhibition of MK2 overexpression, and downregulation of p-P65/P65 caused by the overexpression of downstream HSP27. This would inhibit the heat stress-induced imbalance in oxidative stress and inflammatory responses.",

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer is considered as a major cancer among all types of cancers, especially in developed countries. The colorectal cancer has few to no symptoms and mostly the tumor is often diagnosed in the later stage of cancer. Oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction play an important role in the expansion and the progression of colorectal cancer. Theanine exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential against various diseases. As a result of its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory nature, in this study, we estimated the protective effect of theanine against 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colorectal cancer and explored the possible mechanism. Subcutaneous injection (35 mg/kg) of DMH was used to induce colorectal cancer in rats. Rats were divided into different groups and were orally administrated with theanine (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) for 16 weeks. Body weight, tumor size, and average tumor weight were determined at the end of the experimental study. Biochemical tests, antioxidant properties, phase I and phase II enzymes, and inflammatory mediators were estimated. The mRNA expression of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK), p53, and apoptosis was also estimated at the end of the experimental study. Theanine significantly (p < .001) increases the body weight and suppressed the average tumor size in DMH-induced colorectal cancer. Similarly, it significantly (p < .001) reduces the level of prostaglandin (PGE2 ), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and myeloperoxidase (MPO). It also decreases the oxidative stress by suppressing the level of malonaldehyde (MDA) and enhancing the level of SOD, GPx, CAT, and GR. Theanine considerably reduced tumor markers, such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and phase I and phase II enzymes in a dose-dependent manner. It also significantly (p < .001) suppressed the expression of p38-MAPK, p-53, caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, we can say that theanine exhibited the chemoprotective effect against the colorectal cancer by inhibiting the oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Theanine is the major amino acid phytoconstituent of green tea. It has a potent antioxidant activity and is also able to protect against various oxidative damage. In this experimental study, theanine exhibits a protective effect against colorectal cancer by suppressing the oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction. The results suggest that theanine may be used for colorectal cancer prevention and treatment.",

      "abstract": "Perioperative nutritional therapy requires the consideration of metabolic changes, and it is desirable to reduce stress aiming at early metabolic normalization. Glutathione (GSH) is a tripeptide composed of glutamic acid, cysteine, and glycine. It is one of the strongest antioxidants in the body and important for adjusting immune function. Cystine and theanine (γ-glutamylethylamide) provide substrates of GSH, cysteine and glutamic acid, promoting the synthesis of GSH. It has been reported that the ingestion of cystine (700 mg) and theanine (280 mg) exhibits inhibitory effects against excess inflammation after strong exercise loads in athletes, based on which its application for invasive surgery has been tried. In patients undergoing gastrectomy, ingestion of cystine (700 mg) and theanine (280 mg) for 10 days from 5 days before surgery inhibited a postoperative increase in resting energy expenditure, promoted recovery from changes in interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, lymphocyte ratio, and granulocyte ratio and inhibited an increase in body temperature. In a mouse small intestine manipulation model, preoperative 5-day administration of cystine/theanine inhibited a postoperative decrease in GSH in the small intestine and promoted recovery from a decrease in behavior quantity. Based on the above, cystine/theanine reduces surgical stress, being useful for perioperative management as stress-reducing amino acids.",

L-Theanine (LT), a major amino acid component of green tea, exhibits potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and protects against various neural injuries. We investigated the potential therapeutic effects of LT on RO-induced behavioral and neurochemical dysfunction in rats and the neuroprotective mechanisms underlying these effects. Unilateral stereotaxic intranigral infusion of RO into the SNpc to induce PD-like manifestations induced significant behavioral impairment as evaluated using an open field test, rotarod test, grip strength measurement, and beam-crossing task in rats. LT treatment (300 mg/kg i.p., 21 days) ameliorated most RO-induced behavioral impairments. In addition, LT treatment reduced nitric oxide level and lipid peroxidation production, increased mitochondrial function and integrity, as well as the activities of mitochondrial complexes I, II, IV, and V, and reduced the levels of neuroinflammatory and apoptotic markers in the SNpc and ameliorated the levels of catecholamines, GABA and glutamate in the ST induced by RO. These results demonstrate the possible therapeutic effects of LT against RO-induced behavioral impairments, including antioxidative effects, prevention of mitochondrial dysfunction, prevention of neurochemical deficiency, anti-neuroinflammatory effects, and anti-apoptotic effects. This is the first report on the neuroprotective effect of LT against RO-induced behavioral impairments, and the above evidence provides a potential clinically relevant role for LT in the management of human PD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy is frequently used in cancer treatment; however, it may cause adverse events, which must be managed. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been reported to be involved in the induction of intestinal mucositis and diarrhea, which are common side effects of treatment with fluoropyrimidine 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Our previous studies have shown that oral administration of cystine and theanine (CT) increases glutathione (GSH) production in vivo. In the present study, we hypothesized that CT might inhibit oxidative stress, including the overproduction of ROS, and attenuate 5-FU-induced mucositis and diarrhea. METHODS: We investigated the inhibitory effect of CT administration on mucositis and diarrhea, as well as its mechanism, using a mouse model of 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis. RESULTS: CT administration suppressed 5-FU-induced diarrhea and weight loss in the studied mice. After 5-FU administration, the GSH level and the GSH/GSSG ratio in the small intestine mucosal tissue decreased compared to normal control group; but CT administration improved the GSH/GSSG ratio to normal control levels. 5-FU induced ROS production in the basal region of the crypt of the small intestine mucosal tissue, which was inhibited by CT. CT did not affect the antitumor effect of 5-FU. CONCLUSIONS: CT administration suppressed intestinal mucositis and diarrhea in a mouse model. This finding might be associated with the antioxidant characteristics of CT, including the improved rate of GSH redox and the reduced rate of ROS production in the small intestine mucosal tissue. CT might be a suitable candidate for the treatment of gastrointestinal mucositis associated with chemotherapy.",

Results showed that 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) treatment inhibited the cell proliferation of IPEC-J2 and blocked the normal operation of the cell cycle, while L-theanine pretreatment significantly preserved these trends to exert protective effects.

Thirty lactating Chinese Holstein dairy cattle (189 ± 47 days in milk, and 2 ± 1 parities) were allocated in a completely randomized design to each of 3 dietary treatments: the control (CON, 0 g/d per cow L-theanine), the low L-theanine dosage treatment (LL, 16 g/d per cow L-theanine), and the high L-theanine dosage treatment (HL, 32 g/d per cow L-theanine). This trial consisted of 38 d (7 d for adaption and 31 d for data and sample collection), and sample collection for rumen liquid, blood plasma or serum, and milk were conducted on the d 27 and 38, respectively. Dairy cattle were constantly exposed to environmental heat stress during this experiment according to the recorded temperature-humidity index (THI). In the LL treatment, LPS concentration in rumen liquid was higher (P < 0.05), whilst LPS densities in plasma and milk were lower (P < 0.05) than those of the CON. Supplementing L-theanine at 2 dosages both significantly lowered (P < 0.05) the level of interleukin (IL)-1β in the serum. Results of the present study suggested that L-theanine could be a promising additive in reducing the detrimental effects of heat stress on dairy cows, and L-theanine supplementation at 16 g/d per cow is preferred because it reduced the LPS translocation into the peripheral blood and LPS accumulation in the milk, as well as mitigated LPS-induced inflammatory reactions in dairy cows during heat stress. Further studies are necessitated to investigate the underlying mechanisms of L-theanine in LPS alteration and inflammation alleviation."

The results showed that 3% DSS treatment significantly induced intestinal damage as reflected by DAI, histopathological feature, and colon length, while l-theanine pretreatment markedly prevented these trends to exert protective effects. Meanwhile, l-theanine pretreatment decreased the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, and COX2 on DSS-induced colitis. Notably, DSS inhibited the proliferation and promoted the apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells, thereby damaging the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier, whereas l-theanine also played a protective role by attenuating these deteriorated effects. It was also observed that l-theanine treatment downregulated the levels of p-p65, p65, p-p53, p53, and p-AKT protein expression in acute DSS-induced colitis, which showed the protective function of l-theanine, mainly via the NF-κB signaling pathway. Furthermore, the results of lipid analysis and transcriptome analysis show that l-theanine reversed transcriptional profiles and lipid profiles of colitis models, mainly via the inflammatory reactivity-related pathway. Interestingly, the correlation analysis between transcriptional profiles and lipid profiles showed that inflammatory response-related genes were almost significantly correlated with differential lipid metabolites. In summary, l-theanine plays a protective role in DSS-induced colitis via downregulating the NF-κB signaling pathway and regulating lipid metabolism disorders.",

The two groups of patients were examined by MRI within 48 hours, and the relative apparent diffusion coefficient (rADC) of the cerebral ischemic part of the patients was determined. The partial differential mathematical model was used for data processing to obtain the function of cerebral ischemia time and infarct area, and the data of patients in the cerebral ischemia group and L-theanine treatment group were compared and analyzed. The results showed that the partial differential mathematical model could effectively analyze the linear relationship between the rADC value and time in the treatment of CIRI using L-theanine. The rADC values of the four points of interest in the L-theanine treatment group all increased with time, and there was a positive correlation between the variables X and Y. In observing the efficacy indicators of L-theanine, the L-theanine treatment group showed a significant advantage in the neurospecific enolase (NSE) content compared with the cerebral ischemia group (P < 0.01), and the neurological function score of the L-theanine treatment group gradually decreased and showed a statistically obvious difference on the 7th day of treatment (P < 0.05). In summary, it was verified in this study that the role of L-theanine in the treatment of CIRI was of a great and positive significance for the subsequent treatment of patients with cerebral ischemia, providing reliable theoretical basis and data basis for clinical treatment of CIRI.",

RESULTS: CCI produced a significant increase in hyperalgesia and allodynia, an increase in SFI, a decrease in nerve conduction velocity, increases in NO, MDA, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, MPO, and caspase-3 levels, as well as reduction of GSH, SOD, and CAT in the rat sciatic nerve. LT treatment significantly and dose-dependently alleviated CCI-induced nociceptive pain thresholds and ameliorated abnormal nerve conduction and functional loss in rats with CCI. Moreover, LT treatment reduced NO and MDA levels, increased antioxidative strength, and markedly suppressed the levels of neuroinflammatory and apoptotic markers in injured sciatic nerves. CONCLUSION: This is the first report on the ameliorative effect of LT in CCI-induced NP in rats. This effect might be attributed to its anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and neuroprotective, thus making it potentially useful as an adjuvant to conventional treatment.",

      "abstract": "Psoriasis, the most common skin inflammatory disease, is characterized by massive keratinocyte proliferation and immune cell infiltration into epidermis. L-Theanine (L-THE), a nonproteinogenic amino acid derived from green tea (Camellia sinensis), has been proved to possess the properties of anti-inflammatory, antidepressants and neuroprotective. However, whether L-THE has a therapeutic effect on psoriasis is still unknown. In this study, we found that the epidermal thickness and inflammatory response were significantly reduced in Imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis mice by applying with L-THE on mice skin. The expression of proliferation and inflammation associated genes such as keratin 17, IL-23 and CXCL1-3 was also downregulated by L-THE. Furthermore, L-THE inhibited the production of IL-23 in dendritic cells (DCs) after IMQ treatment, and decreased the levels of chemokines in keratinocytes treated with IL-17A by downregulating the expression of IL-17RA. RNA-seq and KEGG analysis revealed that L-THE significantly regulated the expression of IL-17A and NF-κB signaling pathway-associated genes. Metabolomics analysis displayed that L-THE promoted propanoate metabolism which has been reported to inhibit the activity of TH17 cells. Therefore, our results demonstrated that L-THE significantly decreases the levels of IL-23 and chemokines, and attenuates IMQ-induced psoriasis like skin inflammation by inhibiting the activation of NF-κB and IL-17A signaling pathways, and promoting the propanoate metabolism. Our findings suggest that topical applied L-THE can be used as a topical drug candidate for the treatment of psoriasis or as an adjuvant treatment of ustekinumab or secukinumab to prevent the relapse of psoriasis."

Tramadol is safe analgesic but long-term use confirmed to elevate oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, in brain leads to motor deficits. l-Theanine is an active constituent of green tea which prevents neuronal loss, mitochondrial failure and improves dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), serotonin levels and in the central nervous system (CNS) via antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuromodulatory properties. In the present study, tramadol was injected intraperitoneally to Wister rats for 28 days at a dose of 50 mg/kg. l-Theanine (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg) was administered orally 3 h before tramadol administration from day 14 to day 28. Behavioral analyses including rotarod, narrow beam walk, open field, and grip strength were used to evaluate motor coordination on a weekly basis. On the day 29, all Wistar rats were sacrificed and striatum homogenates were used for biochemical (lipid peroxidation, nitrite, glutathione, glutathione peroxidase activity, superoxide dismutase, catalase, mitochondrial complex I, IV, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate), neuroinflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-17), and neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, GABA, and glutamate) analysis. Chronic tramadol treatment caused motor deficits reduced antioxidant enzymes level, increased striatal proinflammatory cytokines release, dysbalanced neurotransmitters, and reduced mitochondrial complex activity I, IV, and cAMP activity. However, l-theanine administration attenuated behavioral, biochemical, neuroinflammatory, neurotransmitters, and mitochondrial activity indicated it as a promising neuroprotective potential against degenerative changes in experimental model of PD.",

Theanine, as an important amino acid component in tea, is a key quality index for excellent tea quality and high economic value. People increase theanine accumulation in tea mainly through the application of nitrogen fertilizer, shading and pruning. However, these methods are not effective. In this study, we treated tea buds with a 100 μM solution of GA3 containing 1‰ tween-20, investigated the effects of GA3 on theanine accumulation, bud yield, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and expression level of theanine biosynthesis pathway genes in tea plant by qPCR, LC-MS/MS etc. Results showed that change trends of theanine and GA3 was extremely positively correlated with each other. Exogenous GA3 upregulated the expression level of theanine biosynthesis pathway genes, caused an increase of theanine content (mg·g-1) by 27% in tea leaves compared with Mock, and accelerated the germination of buds and elongation of shoots, which lead to a significant increase of tea yield by 56% (w/w). Moreover, the decrease of chlorophyll contents, photochemical quenching coefficient (qP) and relative electron transport rate (rETR) under GA3 treatment suggested that GA3 reduced photosynthesis in the tender tea leaves, indicating that the decline of carbon assimilation in tea plants was conducive to the nitrogen metabolism, and it was beneficial to the accumulation of theanine. This study provided a new technical and theoretical support for the precise control of tea quality components and phenophase.",

We found that intraperitoneal treatment of the mice with l-theanine (100 mg/kg/day) enhanced adaptive thermogenesis and induced the browning of inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) with elevated expression of Prdm16, Ucp1, and other thermogenic genes. Meanwhile, administration of the mice with l-theanine increased energy expenditure. In vitro studies indicated that l-theanine induced the development of brown-like features in adipocytes. The shRNA-mediated depletion of Prdm16 blunted the role of l-theanine in promoting the brown-like phenotypes in adipocytes and in the iWAT of mice. l-theanine treatment enhanced AMPKα phosphorylation both in adipocytes and iWAT. Knockdown of AMPKα abolished l-theanine-induced upregulation of Prdm16 and adipocyte browning. l-Theanine increased the α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) level in adipocytes, which may increase the transcription of Prdm16 by inducing active DNA demethylation on its promoter. AMPK activation was required for l-theanine-induced increase of α-KG and DNA demethylation on the Prdm16 promoter. Moreover, intraperitoneal administration with l-theanine ameliorated obesity, improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, and reduced plasma triglyceride, total cholesterol, and free fatty acids in the high-fat diet-fed mice. Our results suggest a potential role of l-theanine in combating diet-induced obesity in mice, which may involve l-theanine-induced browning of WAT.",

This study was performed to assess the chemopreventive effects of these phytochemicals, alone or together, on dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colon cancer. Thirty male Wistar rats were divided into five groups and subcutaneously injected with saline (negative control group) or 30 mg/kg DMH (the other groups) two times/week for 12 weeks. The negative and positive control animals were orally treated with drinking water, and the other groups were gavaged with theanine (400 mg/kg), theobromine (100 mg/kg), or their mixture for two weeks before and throughout the injection period. At the end of the study, the morphological and histopathological features, Ki-67 proliferation marker, and the expression of Akt/mTOR, JAK2/STAT3, MAPK/ERK, and TGF-β/Smad pathways were investigated. Theanine and theobromine, alone or together, reduced the number of cancerous and precancerous lesions, the volume of tumors, the Ki-67 immunostaining, and the expression of Akt/mTOR and JAK2/STAT3 oncogenic pathways. The simultaneous treatment was more effective in the down-regulation of Akt and mTOR compared to either theanine or theobromine alone. Theobromine administration also caused more inhibitory effects on the Ki-67 and Akt/mTOR expression than theanine. Besides, all dietary interventions increased the mRNA and protein expression of Smad2. In conclusion, theanine and theobromine, alone and in combination, inhibited tumorigenesis through down-regulation of the Akt/mTOR and JAK2/STAT3 pathways and an increment of the Smad2 tumor suppressor. The inhibition of the Akt/mTOR pathway was more pronounced by simultaneous treatment.",

      "abstract": "Chronic adolescent exposure to Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is linked to elevated neuropsychiatric risk and induces neuronal, molecular and behavioral abnormalities resembling neuropsychiatric endophenotypes. Previous evidence has revealed that the mesocorticolimbic circuitry, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and mesolimbic dopamine (DA) pathway are particularly susceptible to THC-induced pathologic alterations, including dysregulation of DAergic activity states, loss of PFC GABAergic inhibitory control and affective and cognitive abnormalities. There are currently limited pharmacological intervention strategies capable of preventing THC-induced neuropathological adaptations. l-Theanine is an amino acid analog of l-glutamate and l-glutamine derived from various plant sources, including green tea leaves. l-Theanine has previously been shown to modulate levels of GABA, DA, and glutamate in various neural regions and to possess neuroprotective properties. Using a preclinical model of adolescent THC exposure in male rats, we report that l-theanine pretreatment before adolescent THC exposure is capable of preventing long-term, THC-induced dysregulation of both PFC and VTA DAergic activity states, a neuroprotective effect that persists into adulthood. In addition, pretreatment with l-theanine blocked THC-induced downregulation of local GSK-3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3) and Akt signaling pathways directly in the PFC, two biomarkers previously associated with cannabis-related psychiatric risk and subcortical DAergic dysregulation. Finally, l-theanine powerfully blocked the development of both affective and cognitive abnormalities commonly associated with adolescent THC exposure, further demonstrating functional and long-term neuroprotective effects of l-theanine in the mesocorticolimbic system.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT With the increasing trend of cannabis legalization and consumption during adolescence, it is essential to expand knowledge on the potential effects of adolescent cannabis exposure on brain development and identify potential pharmacological strategies to minimize Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-induced neuropathology. Previous evidence demonstrates that adolescent THC exposure induces long-lasting affective and cognitive abnormalities, mesocorticolimbic dysregulation, and schizophrenia-like molecular biomarkers that persist into adulthood. We demonstrate for the first time that l-theanine, an amino acid analog of l-glutamate and l-glutamine, is capable of preventing long-term THC side effects. l-Theanine prevented the development of THC-induced behavioral aberrations, blocked cortical downregulation of local GSK-3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3) and Akt signaling pathways, and normalized dysregulation of both PFC and VTA DAergic activity, demonstrating powerful and functional neuroprotective effects against THC-induced developmental neuropathology.",

L-theanine (C7H14N2O3), a nonprotein amino acid derivative from green tea leaves, has been demonstrated to act as an anticarcinogen through proapoptotic and antiproliferative effects. However, the antimetastatic effect of L-theanine in tumor cells and its underlying mechanism are still unclear. Here, we found that L-theanine could suppress invasion, migration, and increase cell-cell adhesion of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. We also found that L-theanine could inhibit the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process in PCa. Our study revealed that L-theanine could downregulate MMP9, N-cadherin, Vimentin, Snail, and upregulate E-cadherin. Furthermore, L-theanine suppressed the transcription of MMP9 and Snail by significantly inhibiting the ERK/NF-κB signaling pathway and the binding activity of p65 to the promoter regions of MMP9 and Snail.

Treatment with L-theanine significantly decreased the disease activity index and ameliorated the inflammation-associated pathological damage in colon length, as well as the histopathological features of DSS-induced colitis. L-Theanine administration also inhibited DSS-induced changes in the colonic tissue that included myeloperoxidase by 4.5-fold and malondialdehyde by 2.3-fold in comparison to the DSS group. In addition, GSH was increased by 85% and lipopolysaccharides level was decreased by 55% in comparison to the DSS group. Proinflammatory cytokines expression, including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α, at the both protein and mRNA levels were also decreased significantly. Notably, the increase in serum content of lipopolysaccharides and colonic expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, toll like receptor (TLR)-2, TLR-4, TLR-6, and TLR-9 induced by DSS were also significantly inhibited by L-theanine administration. In addition, L-theanine also attenuated the reduction of serum contents of diamine oxidase and the production of short-chain fatty acids in the colonic tissue, and gene expression of mucosal barrier zonula occludens-1 and claudin-1 in DSS-induced colitis. Furthermore, 16S rRNA phylogenetic sequencing revealed a shift in microbial community composition induced by DSS, but no significant difference was observed following L-theanine supplementation. Overall, our findings demonstrated that L-theanine inhibits intestinal inflammation and protects against intestinal barrier disruption in mice with DSS-induced colitis. Further clinical trials should be considered to assess the effects of L-theanine supplementation on oxidative and inflammatory responses in humans.",

      "abstract": "L-theanine (γ-Glutamylethylamide) is a nonprotein water soluble amino acid (AA) mostly found in leaves of Camellia sinensis (green tea). This is a key component of green tea and is considered as the most abundant form of total AAs in green tea (i.e., about 50%). L-theanine is an exclusive taste ingredient of tea producing an attractive flavor and aroma in tea. It has biological effects such as antioxidant, growth promoter, immune booster, anti-stresser, hepatoprotective, antitumor, antiaging, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antianxiety activities that are worth noticing. It could reduce the oxidative impairment by reducing the synthesis of reactive oxygen species, oxidative parameters, and lipid damage as well as increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes. The oral ingestion of L-theanine enhanced γδ T-cell proliferation. Therefore, it is being considered an essential compound of green tea that has the ability to improve immune function. The L-theanine can be used as a potential treatment for hepatic injury and immune-related liver diseases via the downregulation of the inflammatory response through the initiation of nitric oxide synthesis and glutathione production which are likely to be critical for the control of hepatic diseases as well as for the improvement of immune function. In addition, it could be used as a best natural feed additive with a potent antistressor by decreasing the levels of corticosterone, dopamine, and noradrenaline. After systematically reviewing the literature, it is noticed that most studies were carried out on mice, pig, human, and butterfly; while dietary supplementation studies of L-theanine in animal and poultry especially among broilers are very limited because of less awareness of this AA. So, the aim of this review is to encourage the veterinarian and poultry researchers to conduct more research at the molecular level about this AA to expose its more beneficial effects and its mechanism of absorption for potential use of this unique green tea AA in poultry nutrition.",

      "abstract": "Theanine (thea) is a unique non-protein amino acid in tea plant (Camellia sinensis) and one of the most important small molecular compounds for tea quality and health effects. The molecular mechanism that maintains thea biosynthesis is not clear but may be reflected in complicated biological networks as other secondary metabolites in plants. We performed an integrative transcriptomic analysis of tea seedlings bud and leave over the time-course of ethylamine (EA) treatment that activated thea pathway. We identified 54 consistent differentially expressed genes (cDEGs, 25 upregulated and 29 downregulated) during thea activation. Gene Ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis of upregulated genes and downregulated genes showed that they may function as a cascade of biological events during their cooperative contribution to thea biosynthesis. Among the total cDEGs, a diversity of functional genes (e.g., enzymes, transcription factors, transport and binding proteins) were identified, indicating a hierarchy of gene control network underlying thea biosynthesis. A gene network associated with thea biosynthesis was modeled and three interconnected gene functional modules were identified. Among the gene modules, several topologically important genes (e.g., CsBCS-1, CsRP, CsABC2) were experimentally validated using a combined thea content and gene expression analysis. Collectively, we presented here for the first time a comprehensive landscape of the biosynthetic mechanism of thea controlled by a underling gene network, which might provide a theoretical basis for the identification of key genes that contribute to thea biosynthesis.",

L-Theanine (2.5 mg/kg), caffeine (2.0 mg/kg), their combination and a placebo were administered in a randomized four-way repeated-measures crossover with washout, to five boys (8-15 years) with ADHD. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed during a Go/NoGo task and a Stop-signal task ~ 1 h post-dose. NIH Cognition Toolbox was administered ~ 2 h post-dose. Treatment vs. placebo effects were examined in multi-level mixed-effects models. L-Theanine improved total cognition composite in NIH Cognition Toolbox (p = 0.040) vs. placebo. Caffeine worsened and L-theanine had a trend of worsening inhibitory control (i.e. increased Stop-signal reaction time; p = 0.031 and p = 0.053 respectively). L-Theanine-caffeine combination improved total cognition composite (p = 0.041), d-prime in the Go/NoGo task (p = 0.033) and showed a trend of improvement of inhibitory control (p = 0.080). L-Theanine-caffeine combination was associated with decreased task-related reactivity of a brain network associated with mind wandering (i.e. default mode network). L-Theanine-caffeine combination may be a potential therapeutic option for ADHD-associated impairments in sustained attention, inhibitory control and overall cognitive performance.",

Rats were pre-treated with L-theanine at 0, 50, 200, or 800 mg/kg/day. IBD was induced in rats using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Histopathological analysis suggests that L-theanine can suppress DSS-induced IBD with significant inhibition of inflammation in large and small intestinal tissues. Moreover, the 200 mg/kg/day L-theanine-treated DSS group had higher body and small intestine weights, a lower disease activity index and expression of inflammatory factors than the DSS group without pre-treatment. In RNA sequencing and tandem mass tag labeling analyses, large number of mRNAs and proteins expression level differed when compared with the DSS-induced rats with and without 200 mg/kg/day L-theanine pre-treatment. Moreover, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis indicates the anti-inflammatory activities of L-theanine in DSS-induced IBD, with a high representation of genes in \"Cholesterol metabolism\" and \"Retinol metabolism\" pathways. Analysis of protein-protein interaction networks further indicates the involvement of these two pathways. These studies suggest that medium-dose L-theanine pre-treatment could ameliorate DSS-induced IBD through molecular mechanisms involving cholesterol and retinol metabolism.",

L-theanine has been reported to inhibit inflammatory responses in some diseases and this study aimed to investigate the effect of L-theanine on Interleukin-1(IL-1)β-stimulated chondrocytes, and in an injury-induced OA rat model. Primary chondrocytes were stimulated by IL-1β (10 ng/mL) for 24 h and then co-cultured with L-theanine for 24 h. The effects of L-theanine on IL-1β-stimulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and hydrolytic enzyme were analyzed using Western blotting, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. An immunofluorescence assay was used to detect nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) phosphorylation. OA was induced by anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) surgery in rats and celecoxib was used as a positive control. OA severity was measured using the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) grading system to describe histological changes. The results showed that L-theanine decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and nitric oxide (NO), both in vivo and in vitro. L-theanine treatment inhibited IL-1β-induced upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-3 and MMP-13, as well as inhibited NF-κB p65 activation. In vivo animal model showed that L-theanine administration (200 mg/kg) significantly alleviated OA lesions and decreased OARSI score. Our data indicated that L-theanine decreased inflammatory cytokines and protected extracellular matrix degradation through inhibition of the NF-κB pathway, and L-theanine may be considered a promising therapeutic strategy in OA prevention.",

However, prophylactic or therapeutic measures have not yet been established. Orally administered amino acids, cystine and theanine, promoted the synthesis of glutathione which was one of the potential candidates for preventing the neuropathy. The aim of this study was to determine whether daily oral administration of cystine and theanine attenuated oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OXLIPN). METHODS: Twenty-eight colorectal cancer patients who received infusional 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) therapy were randomly and evenly assigned to the cystine and theanine group and the control group. OXLIPN was assessed up to the sixth course using original 7-item questionnaire as well as Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grading scale. RESULTS: Neuropathy scores according to our original questionnaire were significantly smaller in the cystine and theanine group at the fourth (p = 0.026), fifth (p = 0.029), and sixth course (p = 0.038). Furthermore, significant differences were also observed in CTCAE neuropathy grades at the fourth (p = 0.037) and the sixth course (p = 0.017). There was one patient in each group who required dose reduction due to OXLIPN. Except for neurotoxicity, no significant differences were noted in the incidence of adverse events, and the total amount of administered oxaliplatin. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated the daily oral administration of cystine and theanine attenuated OXLIPN.",

Extracellular D-Ser concentration is modulated by ASCT neutral amino acid transporters. L-Theanine (L-Tea), a neutral amino acid component of green tea was reported to improve cognitive functions. We thus intended to investigate the possible inhibitory effect of L-Tea on the D-Ser uptake of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, which was previously found as a good model of D-Ser transport into astrocytes. Cells were incubated with D-Ser and various concentrations of L-Tea or the reference compound S-ketamine (S-Ket). The effect on the uptake was assessed by measuring the intracellular D-Ser concentration using a capillary electrophoresis - laser induced fluorescence detection method. L-Tea competitively inhibited D-Ser uptake into SH-SY5Y cells with an IC50 value of 9.68 mM. Having previously described as an inhibitor of ASCT-2 transporter, S-Ket was intended to be used as a positive control. However, no acute inhibition of D-Ser transport by S-Ket was observed. Its long-term effect on the transport was also examined. No significant difference in D-Ser uptake in control and S-Ket-treated cells was found after 72 h treatment, although the intracellular D-Ser content of the 50 μM S-Ket pre-treated cells was significantly higher. L-Tea was found to be a weak competitive inhibitor of the ASCT transporters, while S-Ket did not directly affect D-Ser uptake or modify the uptake kinetics after a long-term incubation period.",

Through microbial transglutaminase-catalysed transamidation of gluten proteins using ethylamine as amine nucleophile, substantial amounts of glutamine residues were converted in theanine residues. Furthermore, using T-cell lines generated from intestinal biopsy specimens of celiac disease patients, this treatment showed the potential to strongly reduce the ability of gluten proteins to stimulate a T-cell-mediated immune response. From a rheological point of view, the functionality of gluten was retained.

However, these physiological responses have yet to be elucidated in humans where L-THE is compared alongside food or as a functional ingredient within the food matrix. The aim of this study was to determine the physiological responses of a single intake of a potential functional food product (mango sorbet) containing L-THE (ms-L-THE; 200 mgw/w) in comparison to a flavour and colour-matched placebo (ms). Eighteen healthy male participants were recruited in this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The participants were required to consume ms-L-THE or placebo and their blood pressure (BP) (systolic and diastolic), heart rate (HR), and heart rate variability (HRV) were monitored continuously over 90 minutes. Eleven males (age 27.7 ± 10.8 years) completed the study. Changes in area under the curve for systolic and diastolic blood pressure and HRV over the 90 minute observation period indicated no differences between the three conditions (all p > 0.05) or within individual groups (all p > 0.05). The values for heart rate were also not different in the placebo group (p = 0.996) and treatment group (p = 0.066), while there was a difference seen at the baseline (p = 0.003). Based on the findings of this study, L-THE incorporated in a food matrix (mango sorbet) demonstrated no reduction in BP or HR and showed no significant parasympathetic interaction as determined by HRV high-frequency band and low-frequency/high-frequency ratio. Further studies should be focussed towards the comparison of pure L-THE and incorporation within the food matrix to warrant recommendations of L-THE alongside food consumption."

We investigated the effects on AGE content, oxidative stress, and inflammatory factors in d-galactose-induced aging rats for prevention and treatment of age-related liver dysfunction. l-Theanine increased activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, thus enhancing total antioxidant capacity, and decreasing malondialdehyde and nitric oxide synthase levels in serum and liver. Levels of the pro-inflammatory factors, interleukin (IL)-1β, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, and IL-6 were decreased in serum and liver, whereas those of anti-inflammatory factors, IL-4 and IL-10, were increased in the serum. Further, l-theanine inhibited AGE production and decreased the levels of the liver function markers, alanine aminotransaminase and aspartate aminotransferase. It also significantly increased the mRNA expression levels of FoxO1 and downregulated NF-κB(p65) but suppressed the phosphorylation of both FOXO1 and NF-κB (p65). Moreover, l-theanine effectively attenuated d-galactose-induced oedema and vacuole formation, thus protecting the liver. Overall, l-theanine reversed the d-galactose-induced imbalance in oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, reduced AGEs content in aging rats, maintained homeostasis in the body, and ameliorated liver aging.",

However, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying theanine's protective actions against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury still remains largely unknown. MAIN METHODS: In this study, rat cerebral IR injury model was established and were randomly divided into the following five groups: Sham (SH), IR, IR + Theanine (TH), IR + TH+ heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) inducer cobalt protoporphyrin (Copp), and IR + Copp groups. KEY FINDINGS: We found that theanine significantly inhibited neuron damage and apoptosis in the hippocampus during the 48 h detection period, as detected by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Meanwhile, reduced levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and elevated activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) were observed in the theanine-treated group. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay also revealed that theanine markedly decreased the levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α, in IR rats. The anti-apoptotic effect of theanine on IR injury was further verified by flow cytometry assay. Besides, theanine dramatically inhibited HO-1 expression and activity but increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activity in hippocampal tissue from rats with cerebral IR injury. However, co-treatment with Copp remarkably abolished the protective effects of theanine on cerebral IR injury. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrated that the neuroprotective role of theanine was associated with its anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties, which might be through regulation of HO-1 activation in rats with cerebral IR injury.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating medical condition for which no effective pharmacological interventions exist. l-Theanine (LT), a major amino acid component of green tea, exhibits potent antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activities and protects against various neural injuries. Here, we evaluated the potential therapeutic effects of LT on the recovery of behavioral motor functions after SCI in rats and the underlying neuroprotective mechanisms. METHODS: SCI was induced by applying vascular clips to the dura through a four-level T5-T8 laminectomy, and saline or LT (10/30 mg/kg) was intrathecally administered at 1-, 6-, and 24-h post-SCI. At 72-h post-SCI, half of the rats from each group for each parameter were sacrificed, and their spinal cord was excised for measurement of malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase, catalase, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β/-6, myeloperoxidase, and caspase-3. The remaining rats from each group were subjected to Bresnahan locomotor-rating scale (BBB), inclined-plane, toe-spread, and hindfoot bar-grab tests at 1-, 4-, 7-, 10-, and 14-days post-SCI. RESULTS: LT treatment reduced NO and MDA levels, increased antioxidative strength, and markedly suppressed the levels of neuroinflammatory and apoptotic markers in the spinal cord after SCI. Moreover, LT treatment drastically promoted the recovery of behavioral motor functions post-SCI. CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed that LT can enhance the recovery of behavioral motor functions after SCI in rats, which related to the suppression of post-traumatic oxidative response, neural inflammation, and apoptosis. This evidence indicates that LT holds considerable potential for use in the clinical treatment/prevention of SCI-induced motor dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Capecitabine-based adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer patients often causes adverse events (AEs), such as diarrhea, stomatitis, anorexia, and hand-foot syndrome (HFS). Cystine and theanine were reported to attenuate some chemotherapy-associated AEs, and hence are also expected to attenuate capecitabine-induced AEs. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of cystine/theanine treatment in colorectal cancer patients undergoing capecitabine-based adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery. METHODS: A total of 100 colorectal cancer patients treated with capecitabine as an adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery were randomly allocated into the cystine/theanine group (n = 52) or the placebo group (n = 48). The primary endpoint was incidence rate of diarrhea of grade 1 or higher in accordance with the Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE) v.4.0, Japanese Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) version. The secondary endpoints included incidence rates of other AEs (CTCAE v.4.0-JCOG), as well as the incidence rate of HFS according to the HFS grading scale. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in capecitabine-induced AEs between the two groups. However, the incidence rate of diarrhea of grade 1 or higher tended to be lower in the cystine/theanine group than the placebo group (18.4% vs. 28.9%, p = 0.169) as well as the incidence rate of HFS of grade 1 or higher (CTCAE v.4.0-JCOG or HFS grading scale) (67.4% vs. 77.8%, p = 0.185, 67.3% vs. 80.0%, p = 0.124, respectively). CONCLUSION: This trial demonstrated that cystine/theanine treatment of colorectal cancer patients undergoing capecitabine-based adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery is safe and has the tendency to reduce the incidence rate of diarrhea or HFS.

      "abstract": "Chemotherapy is one of the most effective methods of treating tumors in clinical study currently, but drug side effects usually are unbearable to the patient, which also makes it difficult to continue chemotherapy. Enhanced drug efficacy and reduced drug side effects are the main strategies for tumor therapy. Herein, based on biochemical regulation, theanine liposomes were designed to adjuvant doxorubicin (DOX) therapy, which can reduce the adverse reactions and enhance the effect of DOX. Stigmasterol was applied instead of traditional cholesterol for reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. The as-prepared theanine liposomes by two methods had optimal sizes (154.8 and 169.0 nm), which can effectively accumulate in tumor tissues. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the theanine liposomes had a good effect of sustaining drug release. Cell uptake indicated that the presence of theanine can effectively inhibit glutathione (GSH) levels in cells and increase the uptake of DOX. In tumor bearing mice experiments, the combination of the theanine liposomes and DOX showed a better tumor inhibitory effect with a smaller tumor volume (2.7 fold) compared with that of the free DOX group. Meanwhile, under the mediation of theanine, the amount of doxorubicin was greatly reduced to achieve the same therapeutic effect, and the side effects of the drug were largely inhibited. Therefore, theanine liposomes have great application potential in tumor chemotherapy."

      "abstract": "Meta-analyses of tea consumption and reduced risk of Parkinson's disease have thrown light in the pathway of exploring beneficial properties of tea components. On the basis of dry mass, a typical black or green tea beverage contains approximately 6% of free amino acids, which impart high quality, taste and distinctive aroma to the tea infusion. L-theanine (chemically known as γ-glutamylethylamide) is a non-proteinogenic amino acid of tea that takes part in the biosynthesis of its polyphenols. Recently discovered neuroprotective effects of L-theanine can be attributed to its structural analogy with glutamate, the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in brain. This unique amino acid also bears a potential to ameliorate the pathophysiological changes associated with Parkinson's disease as it displays antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, improves motor behavioral abnormalities, increases dopamine availability and may cause a favorable downshift in neurodegeneration due to glutamate excitotoxicity. To gain an explicit understanding of the role of L-theanine, this review article is the first one to focus on its mechanism of neuromodulatory action and to critically evaluate the possibilities of employing this bioactive amide in the forage of anti-Parkinsonian medication. We also hypothesize the idea of L-theanine being a potent natural agent against L-DOPA induced dyskinesia, since long-term reliance on dopamine replacement therapy is linked with elevation in glutamate receptor activity.",

A total of 180 one-day-old male Ross 308 broilers were randomly allotted to 2 treatment groups including a THE-free group with 12 replicates of 10 birds each and a THE group with 6 replicates of 10 birds each. On the morning of day 42, after a 9-h fast, the birds of THE-free group were divided into 2 equal groups, and then all birds in the 3 groups were placed into 18 crates and were transported according to the following protocols: 0-h transport of birds in the THE-free group (control group), 3-h transport of birds in the THE-free group (T group), and 3-h transport of birds in the THE group (T + THE group). Results showed that dietary THE supplementation improved feed conversion ratio and birds' final body weight (P < 0.05), while transport and dietary THE supplementation did not affect carcass traits of broilers (P > 0.05). Transport increased bird live weight loss, drip loss, L*24 h, muscle malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl (PC) and lactate contents, while it decreased thymus, spleen, and bursa of Fabricius indexes, pH24h, a*, and muscle total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) activities and glycogen content (P < 0.05). Nevertheless, compared with birds in the T group, birds in the T + THE group exhibited increased thymus, spleen, and bursa of Fabricius indexes, pH24h, a*24 h, and muscle T-AOC, CAT, and GSH-PX activities and glycogen content, and decreased drip loss, L*24 h, and muscle MDA, PC, and lactate contents (P < 0.05). This study provided the first evidence that dietary THE supplementation prevented transport-stress-impaired immune organ indexes and meat quality of broilers, and the reason for maintenance of meat quality by supplementation of THE may be partly ascribed to the changed muscle glycolysis metabolism and antioxidant status.",

In this study, we examined the potential protective effects of LT on haloperidol (HAL)-induced orofacial dyskinesia (OD) in rats. HAL treatment (1 mg/kg intraperitoneally for 21 days) induced OD; significant increases (P < 0.001) in the frequency of vacuous chewing movement and tongue protrusion as well as the duration of facial twitching. LT treatment (100 mg/kg orally for 35 days, starting 14 days before HAL injection) was able to prevent most of the HAL-induced OD. LT treatment was also able to reduce the lipid peroxidation production and nitric oxide (NO) level, and enhance the antioxidation power in striatum from rats with HAL treatment. In order to examine the implication of NO pathway activity in HAL treatment, either NO precursor (L-arginine) or NO synthase inhibitor (L-NAME) was co-pretreated with LT; NO precursor treatment eliminated the protective effect of LT, in contrast to that NO synthase inhibitor treatment significantly potentiated the LT effects on behavioral and biochemical protection in HAL-treated rats. These results suggested that the NO pathway was implicated, at least in part, in the HAL-induced OD, as well as in the protective effect of LT in treating HAL-induced OD. The above evidence provides a clinically relevant value for LT in delaying or treating tardive dyskinesia.",

A number of studies showed neuroprotective effects of theanine after an ischemic cerebral injury or the exposure to toxic chemicals. It also improved cognitive function including attention, memory and learning. Recent studies demonstrated a promising role of theanine in augmentation therapy for major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. Theoretical grounds for using theanine in treatment of bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder and some neurodegenerative disorders are discussed.",

Adjunctive herbal and nutraceutical treatments are a novel and promising treatment option. L-theanine is a non-protein amino acid derived most-commonly from tea (Camellia sinensis) leaves, which may be beneficial in the treatment of anxiety and sleep disturbance as suggested by preliminary evidence. We conducted a 10-week study (consisting of an 8-week double-blind placebo-controlled period, and 1-week pre-study and 2-week post-study single-blinded observational periods) involving 46 participants with a DSM-5 diagnosis of GAD. Participants received adjunctive L-theanine (450-900 mg) or matching placebo with their current stable antidepressant treatment, and were assessed on anxiety, sleep quality, and cognition outcomes. Results revealed that adjunctive L-theanine did not outperform placebo for anxiety reduction on the HAMA (p = 0.73) nor insomnia severity on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI; p = 0.35). However, LT treated participants reported greater self-reported sleep satisfaction than placebo (ISI item 4; p = 0.015). Further, a separation in favour of L-theanine was noted on the ISI in those with non-clinical levels of insomnia symptoms (ISI ≤ 14; p = 0.007). No significant cognitive effects (trail making time and the modified emotional Stroop) were revealed. While this preliminary study did not support the efficacy of L-theanine in the treatment of anxiety symptoms in GAD, further studies to explore the application of L-theanine in sleep disturbance are warranted.",

NEP1-40 competitively inhibits Nogo-66 receptor (NgR1) promotes axonal regeneration. Forty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned into four groups to establish an animal model of brachial plexus root avulsion. Inflammation and oxidative damage were evaluated by spectrophotometry and motor function of the upper limbs was assessed via Terzis grooming test after modeling. Immunofluorescence and hematoxylin and eosin staining were utilized to determine the content of reactive oxygen species, activation of microglial cells, neuroprotection, and nerve regeneration. Compared with the control group, the L-Theanine + NEP1-40 group had significantly decreased myeloperoxidase, malondialdehyde, interleukin-6, reactive oxygen species, and microglial cells, significantly increased score on the Terzis grooming test, increased motor neuron content, and thickened muscle fibers, increased area, and appearance of large and clear motor endplate structures. The results of this study suggest that l-Theanine combined with NEP1-40significantly promoted nerve regeneration after brachial plexus root avulsion, and may be a potential treatment for promoting nerve regeneration. Possible mechanisms underlying these results are alleviation of oxidative damage and inflammatory responses in the injured area and antagonism of myelin inhibition.",

This study aims to investigate the effects of L-theanine (2 mg/kg) on monoamine levels in an animal model of depression. The effect of l-theanine on the symptoms of depression was examined through the open-field test, sucrose preference test, and forced swim test. The monoamine neurotransmitters that involve serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (DA) were measured in the limbic-cortical-striatal-pallidal-thalamic (LCSPT)-circuit related brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens (NAC), striatum (ST), amygdala, and hippocampus (HIP). L-theanine ameliorated the depressive-like behaviors in the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rat model. In the PFC, NAC, and HIP, L-theanine administration significantly increased the levels of 5-HT, NE, and DA. In the ST, the levels of 5-HT and DA were increased after the administration of L-theanine. However, in the HIP, only the level of DA significantly changed after the treatment of L-theanine. Taken together, these results indicated that L-theanine has possibly antidepressant-like effects in the CUMS rat model, which could be mediated by the monoamine neurotransmitters in the LCSPT-circuit related brain regions.",

However, there is no available research report on the use of l-theanine as a feed additive in ducks. This study was conducted to investigate the potential benefits and appropriate dosages of l-theanine on the growth performance, immune function, serum biochemical parameters, and jejunum morphology and antioxidant capacity of ducks. A total of 600 1-day-old Chaohu ducks were randomly allocated into five dietary treatment groups supplemented with 0 (control group), 300, 600, 900 and 1500 mg/kg of l-theanine. Each group included five replicates of 24 birds each. Body weight at day 28 was increased (P&lt;0.05) by l-theanine. From days 15 to 28, l-theanine elevated cumulative BW gain (BWG) and cumulative feed intake (FI), and decreased feed to gain ratio. From days 1 to 28, l-theanine elevated (P&lt;0.05) cumulative BWG and cumulative FI. l-theanine elevated (P&lt;0.05) the relative weight of bursa of Fabricus (day 14), thymus (day 14), spleen (day 28) and liver (day 28). On day 28, l-theanine decreased (P&lt;0.05) serum glucose, uric acid, triacylglycerol, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, insulin, interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-6 contents, and elevated (P&lt;0.05) serum total protein, globulin (GLB), immune globulin A (IgA) and IgG contents, but only serum insulin, interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-6 contents was decreased (P&lt;0.05) and serum GLB and IgM content was elevated (P&lt;0.05) by l-theanine on day 14. On day 14, l-theanine decreased (P&lt;0.05) jejunum crypt depth, and elevated (P&lt;0.05) jejunum villus height, villus height to crypt depth ratio (V/C), goblet cell number and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity. On day 28, l-theanine decreased (P&lt;0.05) jejunum malondialdehyde content, and elevated (P&lt;0.05) jejunum villus height, V/C, goblet cell number, and T-SOD, catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities. l-theanine levels caused quadratic effect on the growth performance, relative organ weight, serum parameters, jejunum morphology and antioxidant capacity. In conclusion, l-theanine can be used as a promising feed additive for ducks, and its optimal supplementation level was 600 to 900 mg/kg based on the current experimental condition.",

So, this study was conducted to explore the effects of L-theanine on the intestinal microbiome and immune response in a broiler. A total of 400-d-old chicks were randomly divided into four treatment groups (A, B, C, and D) using a complete randomized design. Treatments were as follows: A, control (basal diet); B, basal diet + 100 mg L-theanine/kg diet; C, basal diet + 200 mg L-theanine/kg diet; and D, basal diet + 300 mg L-theanine/kg diet. Mucosal samples from ileum and jejunum of broiler chicken were extracted at 21 and 42 d of age. Extraction of genomic DNA was followed by amplification of V3 and V4 hypervariable regions of 16S ribosomal RNA. After Illumina sequencing, results revealed that treatment with L-theanine significantly increased the population of Lactobacillus in ileum and jejunum as compared to a control group, but the higher population was observed in jejunum at both 21 and 42 d of age. The overall diversity of the jejunum microbiome in the treatment group was significantly lower than that of the ileum and control group (P < 0.05). Results of this study revealed that mRNA expression of TLRs (TLR-2 and TLR-4) and cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-2) was decreased in response to treatment with L-theanine. Moreover, the negative correlation of abundance of Lactobacillus was observed with expression of IL-2 and IFN-γ in the intestine and these effects were highly significant (P < 0.01). In summary, our finding revealed that dietary supplementation of L-theanine exhibited a positive influence on intestinal bacteria by supporting beneficial microbes like Lactobacillus while decreasing harmful microbes like Clostridium.",

      "abstract": "Temperature is a major environmental signal that governs plant growth and development. A moderately high ambient temperature alters plant metabolism without significant induction of heat-stress responses. Despite ancillary reports on the negative effect of warmer climate on tea quality, information on specific effect of sub high temperature (SHT) on theanine accumulation is scanty. L-Theanine is the most abundant free amino acid in tea (Camellia sinensis L.) leaves that contributes to the unique umami flavor of green tea infusion. Tea harvested in warmer months lacks distinctive umami taste due to low theanine content. In this study, we showed that SHT (35°C) gradually decreased theanine concentration over time, which was closely associated with the SHT-induced suppression in theanine biosynthetic genes. 24-epibrassinolide (BR), a bioactive brassinosteroids, attenuated the SHT-induced reduction in theanine concentration by upregulating the transcript levels of theanine biosynthetic genes, such as ARGININE DECARBOXYLASE (CsADC), GLUTAMINE SYNTHETASE (CsGS), GLUTAMATE SYNTHASE (CsGOGAT) and THEANINE SYNTHASE (CsTS). Furthermore, time-course analysis of the activity of theanine biosynthetic enzyme reveals that BR-induced regulation of GS and GOGAT activity plays essential role in maintaining theanine content in tea leaves under SHT, which is consistent with the central position of GOGAT in theanine biosynthetic pathway. Therefore, it is convincing to propose that exogenous BR treatment can be advocated to improve summer tea quality by enhancing in vivo accumulation of theanine. However, a future challenge is to use this information on the role of BR in theanine biosynthesis and thermotolerance to further understand how BR may be tuned to benefit plant fitness for enhancing tea quality."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Although adjuvant capecitabine therapy for patients with colorectal cancer after surgery often causes adverse events (AEs), such as diarrhoea, stomatitis, anorexia and hand-foot syndrome (HFS), there are no standard prevention therapies. Cystine and theanine were reported to attenuate some chemotherapy-associated AEs, and are also expected to attenuate the AEs caused by capecitabine treatment. Therefore, our present study aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of cystine/theanine therapy in patients with colorectal cancer undergoing capecitabine-based adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multi-institutional, prospective, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase II trial is being planned. Patients with colorectal cancer treated with capecitabine as an adjuvant chemotherapy will be randomised into either the cystine/theanine group (n=50) or placebo group (n=50). Data will be collected during four courses of capecitabine therapy. The primary endpoint will be incidence rate of diarrhoea of grade 1 or higher in accordance with the Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE) v.4.0, Japanese Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) version. The secondary endpoints are incidence rates of other AEs (CTCAE v.4.0-JCOG), scores of the Japanese version of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire module for all patients with cancer (QLQ-C30) and for patients with colorectal cancer (QLQ-CR29), incidence rate of HFS according to the HFS grading scale, protocol adherence, completion rate of four courses of capecitabine therapy and the proportion of completion without delay or dose reduction, time to completion of four courses of capecitabine and total dose of capecitabine. A sample size of 100 patients will be analysed between November 2016 and April 2018. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained at all participating institutions. The results of this study will be submitted for publication in international peer-reviewed journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: UMIN000024784; Pre-results.",

      "abstract": "Theanine, a unique bioactive constituent from tea ( Camellia sinensis) leaves, is widely used as a functional ingredient and dietary supplement. To evaluate the anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective effects of theanine and its molecular mechanism, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation mouse model was employed in this study. The survival rate of mice in the theanine-treated group increased significantly compared with that of LPS-only group mice. Furthermore, ICR male mice were randomly divided into three or four groups: control, LPS (LPS treatment only), LPS + theanine (20 mg/kg/day), and theanine (theanine treatment only). The results showed that compared with the LPS group, the liver damage and oxidative stress of the theanine-treated group decreased significantly, based on plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentrations, hepatic total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and histological scores and apoptosis [terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining and caspase-3 activity] in the liver tissues. Furthermore, compared with no treatment, pretreatment with theanine significantly decreased the release of interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, inhibited the expression of several inflammatory factors (including IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6), and increased the IL-10/interferon (IFN)-γ ratio in the hepatic tissues. In the LPS-induced inflammation model, theanine inhibited the expression of proinflammatory mediators involved in the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), and attenuated the phosphorylation of NF-κB in the hepatic tissues. Moreover, theanine suppressed the acute-phase response (elevated nitric oxide and C-reactive protein levels). Furthermore, theanine suppressed the LPS-induced inflammatory state by normalizing hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity. Taken together, the results suggest that theanine potentially ameliorates LPS-induced inflammation and acute liver injury; molecular mechanism of action may involve normalization of HPA axis hyperactivity and inactivation of the NF-κB signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "Synaptic refinement improves synaptic efficiency, which provides a possibility to improve memory in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the current study, we aimed to investigate the role of L-theanine, a natural constituent in green tea, in hippocampal synaptic transmission and to assess its potential to improve memory in transgenic AD mice. Initially, we found that L-theanine bath application facilitated hippocampal synaptic transmission and reduced paired-pulse facilitation (PPF). These effects were blocked by antagonists of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors and the dopamine D1/5 receptor, and a selective protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor. Moreover, L-theanine enhanced PKA phosphorylation via dopamine D1/5 receptor activation. L-theanine did not influence hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in the slices obtained from wild-type mice, but rescued the impairment of hippocampal LTP in AD mice. Importantly, systemic application of L-theanine also improved memory and hippocampal LTP in AD mice. Our results demonstrate that L-theanine administration promotes hippocampal dopamine and noradrenaline release, and stimulates PKA phosphorylation. Moreover, the rescued hippocampal LTP in AD mice could be impaired by a PKA inhibitor. Our data reveal that L-theanine ameliorates the impairment of memory and hippocampal LTP in AD mice, likely through dopamine D1/5 receptor-PKA pathway activation. These data warrant the consideration of L-theanine as a candidate for the treatment of AD.",
