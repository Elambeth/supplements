      "abstract": "Age is a primary risk factor for chronic conditions, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Impairments in autophagy processes are implicated in AMD progression, but the extent of autophagy's contribution and its therapeutic potential remain ambiguous. This study investigated age-associated transcriptomic changes in autophagy pathways in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and evaluated the protective effects of topical trehalose, an autophagy-enhancing small molecule, against light-induced outer retinal degeneration in mice. Transcriptomic analysis of human RPE/choroid and mouse RPE revealed consistent downregulation of autophagy pathways with age, alongside variable changes as AMD severity progressed. Given the age- and AMD-associated perturbation of autophagy pathways, we examined trehalose treatment in vitro, which enhanced autophagic flux and restored mitochondrial respiratory function in primary murine RPE cells exposed to oxidative stress. In vivo, topical trehalose improved autophagy-lysosome activity in mouse RPE, as demonstrated by elevated LC3B turnover and SQSTM1/p62 degradation. Furthermore, trehalose eyedrops protected mice from light-induced damage to the RPE and photoreceptors, preserving outer nuclear layer thickness, RPE morphology, and junctional F-actin organization. Taken together, the data support that age-related decline and severe dysregulation in autophagy contributed to AMD progression. By restoring autophagic flux, topical trehalose demonstrates therapeutic potential to address early autophagy-related pathological changes in AMD."

      "abstract": "The emergence of novel carrier systems for dry powder inhalers is an attractive research subject. Additionally, the site-specific pulmonary delivery of theophylline (THN) remains challenging. Therefore, the present research aims to assess the potential enhancement of THN local delivery to the deep lung via powder inhalation for asthma treatment by developing appropriate fine carriers utilizing the well-established spray-drying technique. The preliminary study aimed to develop novel trehalose-based carrier systems combined with amino acids leucine, glycine, and arginine. Aqueous feedstock solutions were spray-dried, and the obtained microparticulate carriers were assessed. Subsequently, therapeutic powders were produced by spray drying ethanol 10 % solutions of THN combined with candidate-developed carriers. Following each sample preparation, it was subjected to structural, thermal, morphological, rheological, aerodynamic, and particle size distribution characterization. Furthermore, THN solubility was determined. In vitro drug release and diffusion, in vitro and in silico simulated lung deposition, and aerodynamic particle count were analyzed by applying samples equivalent to 10 mg of THN. To summarize the outcomes, carriers composed of trehalose with either leucine or a leucine-glycine combination demonstrated superior respirable properties and were considered candidates for further development. THN co-spray-dried samples showed less crystalline structure and particle size of 4-5 µm, leading to profound solubility enhancement (⁓20 fold) and rapid drug release compared to the pure THN (⁓100 % in 5 min). The in vitro and in silico aerodynamic measurements demonstrated that the THN-trehalose-leucine combination had a significantly enhanced fine particle fraction (43 %), leading to higher deep lung deposition (36 %), and the aerodynamic counter confirmed the development of fine particles (mean=3.61 µm). Moreover, the in vitro experiments on the A549 cells demonstrated that the optimized formulation has a low cytotoxicity profile. In conclusion, the acquired characteristics suggest that inhalable co-spray-dried THN with the trehalose-leucine fine carrier may be a practical approach for local asthma therapy."

      "abstract": "Trehalose promotes polysaccharide synthesis in edible mushrooms, yet its effect on the antioxidant activity and structure of Lentinula edodes mycelium polysaccharides is still unknown. We investigated the effect of trehalose on the antioxidant activity of L. edodes polysaccharides and expression of genes related to L. edodes polysaccharide metabolism. Five g/L trehalose increased the biomass and polysaccharide content of L. edodes mycelium by over 50 % compared to the control. Trehalose increased the superoxide anion radical scavenging rate of L. edodes polysaccharides up to 80.9 %. Compared to the control, the molecular weight of polysaccharides was lower, and their glucuronic acid content was higher in the trehalose treatment. RNA-seq analysis revealed 1045 differentially expressed genes in the trehalose treatment compared to the control. Genes related to glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway, starch and sucrose metabolic pathway, and the pentose and glucuronate interconversions pathway were differentially expressed, possibly accounting for the increased polysaccharide synthesis. In summary, exogenous trehalose has potential to increase the biosynthesis and biological activity of L. edodes polysaccharides."

      "abstract": "Autophagy, a conserved catabolic process, is critical for cellular homeostasis and its dysregulation has been implicated in a number of conditions including hypertension, obesity and bladder dysfunctions. The autophagy inducer trehalose has shown promise in treating diseases; however, some studies have reported detrimental effects in vascular tissue under health conditions. In the bladder, the effects of trehalose remain unclear. Therefore, in the present study, male C57BL6/JUnib mice (8 weeks old) were divided into control and trehalose-treated groups (120 mg/mouse/day via gavage) for 4 weeks. After treatment, bladders were harvested for functional, biochemical, and molecular analyses. The trehalose treatment increased the bladder smooth muscle (BSM) contractility to carbachol (CCh), without altering relaxation response to isoproterenol. The CCh-induced BSM hypercontractility was completely abolished by the in vitro incubation of apocynin and diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), implicating NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) on this process. Accordingly, increased levels of superoxide anion (O2-) were found in the urothelial layer, but not in BSM, of trehalose-treated mice. Trehalose also increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity in the bladder but failed to upregulate autophagy-related proteins LAMP1 and Beclin-1 in the bladder. Collectively, we show for the first time that trehalose induces BSM hypercontractility in mice, linked to increased levels of O2- and senescent cell, independently of autophagy activation. Therefore, trehalose administration is an effective model for studying BSM hypercontractility in mice, particularly associated with oxidative stress and cellular senescence."

      "abstract": "Trehalose has been proposed as a possible therapeutic option for attenuating the neuropathological changes associated with neurodegeneration, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The administration of trehalose in human and murine models was linked to restoring antioxidant status, decreasing lipoperoxidation, and alleviating neuroinflammation. This latter biochemical mechanism was associated with the upregulation of specific brain-enriched microRNAs (miRNA). Herein, using a direct hybridization approach, we evaluate trehalose intravenous treatment in AD patients, conducting a phase two clinical trial (IRCT20130829014521N15) examining the alteration of microRNA profiles before and after the treatment. Twenty patients were recruited and randomly assigned to two groups: the intervention group received 15 g/week of intravenous trehalose. The control group received placebo in the form of normal saline. The period chosen was 12 weeks. Blood samples were obtained at the beginning and end of the study. Circulating microRNAs expression data between the placebo and treatment groups were assessed using microarray analysis. Subsequently, differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs specific to the trehalose-treated group were identified, and their gene targets were determined by bioinformatics-based approaches. The analysis of DE miRNAs pointed out modulation in unique miRNAs between treatment and placebo groups. Specifically, hsa-miR-1268a, -3605-3p, -555, and -6511a-3p were significantly downregulated, while hsa-miR-324-3p and -539-5p showed significant upregulation. Of the 147 overlapped validated genes identified in the bioinformatics analysis, several are related to autophagy, protein aggregation, oxidative stress, and inflammation. KEGG enrichment pathways reveal regulation of actin cytoskeleton, axon guidance, and neurotrophin signaling pathways. The results identify significant modulation in unique miRNAs in AD patients under trehalose. These findings suggest the potential utility of these microRNAs as biomarkers for trehalose pharmacological monitoring in AD."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to undertake a more comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy and comparative advantage of hyaluronic acid (HA) combined preparations in an experimental alkali model. METHOD: In the present study, experimental chemical burns were induced in the right eyes of 22 New Zealand rabbits. The eyes were then divided into four groups for subsequent analysis: Trehalose + HA (Group T, n = 6); dexpanthenol + HA (Group P, n = 6); coenzyme Q10+vitamin E + HA (Group V, n = 6); and one control group (CG, n = 4). RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in the size of the epithelial defect area between the groups on days 1, 3, and 5. However, a marked difference in the healing of epithelial defects was observed. Histologic analysis revealed optimal healing in terms of stromal edema, epithelial disruption, and lymphatic infiltration in group P. Alpha SMA (alpha smooth actin)-positive areas was higher in groups P and V. Electron microscopic examination revealed enhanced anterior surface epithelial formation and collagen arrangement in the treatment groups compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study are consistent with those of other studies in the literature, which have shown the superiority of trehalose, dexpanthenol, and coenzyme Q10 to the control group. Furthermore, histologic and immunohistochemical evaluations revealed that the P and V groups exhibited superior healing signs in comparison to the T group. Notably, our study is the first to comparatively analyze artificial tears with trehalose, dexpanthenol, and coenzyme Q10 in terms of epithelial defect healing, incorporating electron microscopic examination."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus remains a pervasive global health concern, urging a deeper exploration of islet transplantation as a potential enduring solution. The efficacy of this therapeutic approach pivots on the precision of cryopreservation techniques, ensuring both the viability and accessibility of pancreatic islets. This study delves into the merits of cryopreserving these islets using the disaccharide trehalose, accompanied by an inventive strategy involving poly L proline (PLP) as a cell-penetrating peptide to overcome the cryoprotectant limitations inherent to trehalose. METHODS: In our experiments with rat islets, we conducted meticulous viability assessments for fresh and frozen samples. We employed a spectrum of methods, including live/dead staining, insulin/glucagon staining, and measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. To gauge functional integrity, we executed glucose-stimulated insulin secretion tests. Subsequently, we transplanted thawed islets into diabetic mice to scrutinize their performance in clinically relevant conditions. RESULTS: Our study yielded compelling results, affirming the successful cryopreservation of pancreatic islets using trehalose and PLP. Viability, as corroborated through live/dead and insulin/glucagon staining, underscored the sustained preservation of frozen islets. Moreover, these preserved islets exhibited functional integrity by releasing insulin responsively to glucose stimulation. Significantly, upon transplantation into diabetic mice, the thawed islets proficiently restored euglycemia, evidenced by a substantial reduction in fasting blood glucose and an enhanced glucose tolerance. CONCLUSION: Our findings accentuate the potential of trehalose and PLP as sophisticated cryoprotectants for preserving pancreatic islets. Beyond highlighting viability and functionality, the preserved islets demonstrated a remarkable capacity to restore euglycemia post-transplantation. This research holds promise in addressing the inherent limitations of islet transplantation, particularly in the realm of Type 1 diabetes treatment.",

All patients were treated with a combination of 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose, glycerin 0.9%, and trehalose 3% with a dosing regimen of one drop four times a day for 1 month with a final evaluation of the same parameters. Results: We included 67 eyes (80.6% females) with a mean age of 48.3 ± 16.2 years (standard deviation [SD]). In total, 37% of the subjects had comorbidities such as hypothyroidism (9%), ocular rosacea (4%), Sjogren's syndrome (4%), and arterial hypertension (4%). Of these, 34% were taking systemic medications and 56.7% had previous ocular surgery. The mean ocular surface disease index score before treatment was 57.6 ± 17.2 (SD) and 22.2 ± 12.9 points (SD) after treatment (P < 0.05). Other parameters such as noninvasive break-up time, meniscus height, and meibography improved without a statistically significant difference. Conclusion: Cristal Tears Plus is a novel, combined, and multipurpose treatment for dry eye disease."

      "abstract": "Rationale: Cisplatin is a potent chemotherapeutic agent limited by significant nephrotoxicity. Multiple cycles of cisplatin administration are necessary to confer chronic disease. Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway that enables the clearance and reuse of cytoplasmic components and is essential for maintaining the integrity and normal physiological function of tissues and organs. However, the precise role of autophagy in renal fibrosis has been controversial. Trehalose, a well-known autophagy inducer, plays a cytoprotective role under various stress conditions, such as oxidative damage, dehydration, and temperature changes. In this study, we established a model of cisplatin-induced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and human renal tubular epithelial cells (HK2) injury to investigate the nephroprotective effects of trehalose on cisplatin-induced CKD and the underlying mechanisms involved. Methods: Firstly, we measured the role of autophagy in cisplatin-induced injury models both in vivo and in vitro by western blot and immunofluorescence staining, combined with transcriptomics. Then, biomedical, cellular, and molecular approaches were utilized to evaluate the potential protective effect of trehalose intervention in regulating autophagy. Mechanistically, we performed this study using proximal tubular epithelial cells-specific transcription factor EB (TFEB) knockout mice and TFEB small-interfering RNA technology to determine whether TFEB deficiency affects the pharmacological effected of trehalose in cisplatin-induced injury models. Results: Due to the activation of autophagy, trehalose inhibited mitochondrial dysfunction (mitochondrial fragmentation, depolarization, reactive oxygen species) and cellular senescence induced by cisplatin both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, renal dysfunction, pathological changes and fibrosis were alleviated in CKD mice after trehalose treatment. Mechanistic investigations revealed that trehalose accumulated in lysosomes and inhibited mTORC1 activity, which triggered TFEB and TFEB-mediated autophagy. In addition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of TFEB in HK2 cells or renal proximal tubular epithelial cells-specific (TECs-specific) TFEB deficiency in mice markedly abolished the beneficial effects of trehalose. Conclusion: Our findings suggested that trehalose induced autophagy to alleviate cisplatin-induced chronic kidney injury by targeting the mTOR-dependent TFEB signaling pathway.",

We assessed symptom relief, tolerability, and patient experience of a novel carboxymethyl-cellulose-based artificial tear formulation with trehalose and sodium hyaluronate (ABBV-444) in patients with DED. METHODS: This open-label, single-arm, single center study enrolled adult patients with baseline Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) scores of ≥18 and ≤65. Patients were instructed to use ABBV-444 as often as needed but at least twice a day for 30 days. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in OSDI score at Day 30. Secondary endpoints were onset of action (change from baseline in current symptom survey [CSS] visual analog scale [VAS] scores over 5 minutes post administration on Day 1) and patients' experience (change from baseline in Patient Eye Drop Experience [PEDE] survey VAS scores at Day 30). Outcomes were assessed in the per-protocol (PP) population using descriptive statistics. A paired t-test was performed to calculate P-values. RESULTS: A total of 34 patients were included in the PP population. DED severity, measured by OSDI, significantly decreased by a mean (standard deviation; SD) score of 6.8 (15.0) points from baseline to Day 30 (P=0.006). Patients showed significant symptom improvement as early as 30 seconds after application, with mean (SD) CSS changes from baseline of -3.3 (10.3) points at 30 seconds (P=0.03) and -10.1 (10.6) points at 5 minutes post-dose (P<0.001). No adverse events were reported. PEDE scores averaged between 76.4 (36.7) and 85.7 (21.0) at Day 30. CONCLUSION: Continuous daily treatment with ABBV-444 reduced DED symptom severity over 30 days and demonstrated rapid onset of action within 30 seconds post administration. These results suggest that ABBV-444 is a viable therapy for DED symptoms and support further investigation of longer-term treatment in multicenter trials."

Ids insufficiency results in the accumulation of GAG in various organs, ultimately resulting in multisystemic disease. Trehalose, a non-reducing disaccharide, has shown protective effects against various diseases. However, its potential utility through oral administration in MPS II has not yet been explored. In the present study, to investigate the efficacy of oral trehalose in Ids-knock-out (KO) mice, Ids-KO and wild type (WT) mice were treated with 2% trehalose dissolved in distilled water ad libitum for 24 weeks. Histological analysis revealed that almost all tissues from Ids-KO mice exhibited abnormal changes, including large vacuolization, inflammatory cell infiltration, and GAG deposition. However, oral administration of trehalose significantly suppressed GAG levels, vacuolization, inflammation and apoptosis in the spleen and brain. Additionally, oral trehalose considerably improved cognitive functions, such as short-term spatial learning and working memory, alongside limited improvements in walking capacity in Ids-KO mice. These results suggest that oral trehalose can reduce GAG accumulation, vacuolization and the number of apoptotic and inflammatory cells in pathological tissues including the brain, ultimately considerably improving spontaneous alteration behavior and could be a promising treatment option for MPS II.",

      "abstract": "Plants have developed complex regulatory networks to adapt to various stresses, including cold stress. Trehalose (Tre), known as the \"sugar of life,\" plays a crucial role in enhancing cold tolerance by triggering antioxidation. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. This study examines the transcription factor gene CmTGA8, which is induced by Tre under normal and cold conditions in melon seedlings (Cucumis melo L.), through transcriptome analysis and RT-qPCR. Reverse genetic analyses showed that silencing CmTGA8 reduced ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities, suppressed CmAPX1 and CmGSTU25 expression, and increased cold susceptibility in melon seedlings. Our previous reports illustrated that Tre treatment significantly induced the expression of respiratory burst oxidase homologues (CmRBOHD) gene, encoding NADPH oxidases responsible for generating apoplastic H2O2. Silencing CmRBOHD markedly inhibited CmTGA8, CmAPX1, and CmGSTU25 expression and reduced cold tolerance. Moreover, H2O2 treatment upregulated CmTGA8 expression, while the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) treatment downregulated it. Additionally, CmTGA8 physically interacted with CmAPX1 and CmGSTU25 to promote their expression. Silencing CmGSTU25 decreased GST activity and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), further increasing cold sensitivity. These findings identify a novel regulatory hierarchy of the H2O2-CmTGA8-CmAPX1/CmGSTU25 cascade in the Tre-mediated cold response pathway in melon seedlings.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myelin-laden foamy macrophages accumulate extensively in the lesion epicenter, exhibiting characteristics of autophagolysosomal dysfunction, which leads to prolonged inflammatory responses after spinal cord injury (SCI). Trehalose, known for its neuroprotective properties as an autophagy inducer, has yet to be fully explored for its potential to mitigate foamy macrophage formation and exert therapeutic effects in the context of SCI. RESULTS: We observed that trehalose significantly enhances macrophage phagocytosis and clearance of myelin in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. In vivo, trehalose administration markedly reduced myelin debris accumulation, inhibited foamy macrophage formation, suppressed inflammatory responses, decreased fibrotic scarring, and promoted axonal growth and motor function recovery after SCI. These beneficial effects of trehalose may be related to the overexpression of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a key regulator of the autophagy-lysosomal system, which can rescue autophagic dysfunction in foamy macrophages and inhibit inflammatory responses. Additionally, the effects of trehalose on macrophages were abolished by chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, suggesting trehalose's potential as a therapeutic candidate for enhancing myelin debris clearance post-SCI. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the pivotal role of trehalose in modulating myelin debris clearance within macrophages, providing new perspectives for the treatment of spinal cord injury."

      "abstract": "The incidence of non-albicans Candida infections has witnessed a substantial rise in recent decades. Candida glabrata (Nakaseomyces glabratus), an opportunistic human fungal pathogen, is accountable for both superficial mucosal and life-threatening bloodstream infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Distinguished by its remarkable resilience to environmental stressors, C. glabrata exhibits intrinsic tolerance to azoles and a high propensity to swiftly develop azole resistance during treatment. The molecular mechanism for the high tolerance is not fully understood. In this work, we investigated the possible role of trehalose in this tolerance. We generated mutants in the C. glabrata TPS1, TPS2, and NTH1 genes, encoding trehalose 6-phosphate synthase (Tps1), trehalose 6-phosphate phosphatase (Tps2), and neutral trehalase (Nth1), respectively. As expected, the tps1∆ strain cannot grow on glucose. The tps2∆ strain demonstrated diminished trehalose accumulation and very high levels of trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P), the biosynthetic intermediate, in comparison to the wild-type (WT) strain. Whereas these higher T6P levels did not affect growth, the lower trehalose levels clearly resulted in lower environmental stress tolerance and a lower susceptibility to fluconazole. More interestingly, the tps2∆ strain completely lost tolerance to fluconazole, characterized by the absence of slow growth at supra-MIC concentrations of this drug. All these phenotypes are reversed in the nth1∆ strain, which accumulates high levels of trehalose. Our findings underscore the role of trehalose in enabling tolerance toward fluconazole in C. glabrata. We further show that the change in tolerance is a result of the effect that trehalose has on the sterol pattern in the cell.",

      "abstract": "Trehalose has neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative diseases. This study aimed to explore the impact of trehalose on traumatic brain injury (TBI) by investigating its role in neuroprotection. The TBI mice model was established utilizing the cortical impact technique followed by trehalose treatment. Traumatic neuronal injury induced by scratch followed by trehalose treatment was performed to mimic TBI in vitro. Memory function was assessed using the Water maze test. Brain damage was evaluated through various methods including brain water content analysis, Nissl staining, Evans blue exudation, and TUNEL staining. Biochemical and morphological changes related to ferroptosis post-TBI were also examined. The results showed that trehalose was found to enhance spatial memory, reduce brain injury, and inhibit ferroptosis in TBI mice, similar to ferroptosis inhibitors. The influence of trehalose on TBI was reversed by the SIRT3 inhibitor. Trehalose upregulated SIRT3 to increase SOD activity in TBI, which could also be counteracted by the SIRT3 inhibitor. Combining trehalose with a ferroptosis inhibitor had a more significant effect on reducing brain injury and inhibiting ferroptosis. Furthermore, in TBI mice treated with trehalose and SIRT3 inhibitors, the effect of trehalose was reversed by SIRT3 inhibitors, but the addition of ferroptosis inhibitors reversed the effect of SIRT3 inhibitors, as shown by decreased ferroptosis and neuronal apoptosis in damaged brain tissue. In summary, this study provides initial evidence that trehalose plays a crucial role in neuroprotection post-TBI through the SIRT3/SOD2 pathway-mediated ferroptosis.",

Using a cln8-/- zebrafish model, we identified significant impairments in locomotion, anxiety, and aggression, along with subtle deficits in social interactions, positioning zebrafish as a useful model for therapeutic studies in NCL. Our findings show that trehalose, an autophagy enhancer, ameliorates anxiety, and modestly improves social behavior and predator avoidance in mutant zebrafish. This finding aligns animal models with clinical reports suggestive of behavioral improvements in NCL patients.

Given the promising results of treatment with trehalose, an autophagy inducer, in cell and animal models of NCL, we conducted an open-label, non-placebo-controlled, non-randomized 12-month prospective study in NCL patients receiving oral trehalose (4 g/day). All were treated with a commercially available formulation for 6 months, followed by a 6-month washout. The primary endpoint was the presence of severe adverse reactions during treatment; secondary endpoints were clinical changes documented using the validated Unified Batten Disease Rating Scale and the Hamburg scale. Leveraging on our recent multiomic studies identifying convergent biomarkers in NCLs, fluid biomarker changes were taken as additional secondary endpoints. Of the 17 patients enrolled, 11 completed the study. Oral intake of trehalose in NCL patients with different genetic forms and at different disease stages was found to be well tolerated over 6 months. Oral trehalose is associated with subjective benefits reported by caregivers, but not with improvement or worsening on clinical scales. Analysis of potential biomarkers demonstrated significant differences between patients and controls at baseline, but we observed no modifications over time, or correlations with clinical scales and treatment. In our pilot experience in a heterogeneous disease group of NCL, oral trehalose seemed safe for patients. While subjective improvements were reported by caregivers, larger multicenter randomized placebo-controlled studies, and perhaps additional clinical tools covering multiple functions affected by the disease, will be needed to identify possible improvements in clinical scale scores and biomarkers.",

As a C4 plant with high efficiency in utilizing light and carbon dioxide, maize (Zea mays L.) is one of the most important crops worldwide. This study aims to investigate the pathways and mechanisms by which trehalose mediates the improvement of salt tolerance in maize through a combined analysis of physiology and transcriptomics. The results indicate that foliar application of trehalose treatment significantly increased maize biomass and antioxidant enzyme activity while reducing the H2O2 and Na+/K+ ratios in both the aerial and underground parts of the plant. Additionally, trehalose enhanced the total secretion of organic acids from maize roots, improving the soil microenvironment for maize growth under salt stress and alleviating Na+ toxicity. Transcriptomic data revealed that under salt stress, most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched in pathways related to photosynthesis, abscisic acid signaling, and sugar metabolism, and trehalose application increased the expression levels of these pathways, thereby mitigating the growth inhibition caused by salinity. This study elucidates mechanisms for enhancing salt tolerance in maize, providing theoretical support for improving its resilience and offering innovative strategies for utilizing a wide range of saline-alkali land."

The control trehalose concentration was 0 mM, while TRE50 (50 mM), TRE100 (100 mM), and TRE200 (200 mM) were used as experimental trehalose concentrations. The kinematic and functional parameters of frozen/thawed spermatozoa were evaluated in vitro using mobile computer-assisted sperm analysis and a flow cytometer. The addition of 100 mM trehalose demonstrated the most favorable results for total (34.17%) and progressive (3.57%) motility after thawing. A statistically significant difference was found for these kinetic parameters compared to the other monitored concentrations. This experimental group was also found to have a significantly higher percentage of spermatozoa without plasma membrane or acrosome damage (33.37%) compared to the TRE50 group (30.74%; p < 0.05) and the TRE200 group (29.05%; p < 0.05). In vivo, artificial insemination was performed to verify fertilization ability. Hens (n = 40) were artificially inseminated twice (10 hens/treatment) with a 3-day interval between inseminations. In conclusion, the addition of 100 mM trehalose significantly improved total and progressive motility after thawing and preserved plasma membrane and acrosome integrity (p < 0.05). The fertilization rate of eggs fertilized with semen frozen with the addition of 100 mM trehalose was not significantly different from the other concentrations tested or the control group but was numerically higher (23.21% vs. 15.20% of fertilized eggs in this group)."

      "abstract": "Granulomas, dense clusters of immune cells and bacteria, are critical barriers in tuberculosis (TB) treatment. Recent advancements in TB management have highlighted granuloma control as a potential host-directed therapy (HDT) strategy. Although isoniazid (INH) is the first-line drug for TB therapy, its efficacy is limited to non-replicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) under granulomatous conditions, necessitating the development of more effective derivatives. In this study, hybrid compounds of isoniazid, designated as INH-D1 and INH-D2, were synthesized and evaluated for their effects on controlling inflammatory responses and pulmonary granuloma lesions induced by trehalose-6,6'-dimycolate (TDM), a glycolipid of Mtb. Both INH-D1 and INH-D2 demonstrated stronger inhibitory effects on inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, interleukin-6, co-stimulatory molecules, and MHC class I) in TDM-stimulated macrophages compared to original INH. These anti-inflammatory effects were mediated by the inhibition of Syk, p38, PI3K, and NF-κB transcription. INH-D1 and INH-D2 exhibited stronger binding energies to Syk and PI3Kα/β than INH, which are known as proximal kinases and key mediator in TDM-mediated inflammatory responses. Oral administration of INH-D2 successfully relieved TDM-induced pulmonary granuloma pathology by reducing innate immune cell infiltration, hypoxic conditions in the lungs, and systemic inflammation by decreasing serum cytokines and chemokines. In contrast, original INH and INH-D1 did not effectively alleviate pulmonary granuloma pathology. These findings demonstrate that the novel molecule INH-D2 is effective in treating pulmonary granulomas owing to its strong anti-inflammatory effects, highlighting it as a promising HDT candidate for the management of pulmonary tuberculosis, thereby providing a strategic alternative to standard anti-TB antibiotics.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Appropriate management of fractures is crucial for restoring natural bone function and preventing long-term complications. Previous research on animal models indicates that trehalose can improve bone fracture healing by inhibiting the inflammatory cascade. We hope that trehalose can accelerate bone fracture healing in humans, alleviate pain, and ultimately enhance the individual's quality of life. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind clinical trial will be conducted at Taleghani Hospital in Tehran, Iran. Sixty-four patients admitted to the orthopedic ward will be enrolled based on eligibility criteria. The participants will be randomly allocated based on the permuted block randomization into two groups: those receiving trehalose (32 patients) or placebo (32 patients). The patients in the trehalose and placebo groups will receive 3.3 g of trehalose or placebo for 12 weeks, respectively. A consent form, general questionnaire, as well as the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Harris Hip Score (HHS), and radiological analyses will be used to assess fracture healing quality. The intention-to-treat principle will form the basis of the statistical analysis. DISCUSSION: The trial results may provide a convenient and safe adjuvant treatment option for the Pertrochanteric Fractures population. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials.

Recent studies have shown that trehalose (Tre) can activate autophagy and have antioxidant effects. However, whether Tre can be used to attenuate ovarian aging remains unclear. Therefore, the anti-aging effects of Tre on the ovary were explored both in vivo and in vitro. D-galactose (D-gal) was administered i.p. daily (200 mg/kg body weight) for 8 weeks to establish the mouse ovarian aging model (n = 10). We found that Tre significantly reversed ovarian weight loss and reduced the number of TUNEL-positive granulosa cells caused by D-gal in mouse ovaries. Tre elevated the protein expression levels of LC3-II, Parkin, PINK1, Beclin1, and LAMP2 in ovaries. Mitochondrial-related proteins TOM20 and COX IV expression levels were increased by Tre administration. In vitro studies further supported these findings, showing that Tre treatment significantly reduced the number of SA-β-gal and PI-positive cells, and decreased ROS levels in cultured granulosa cells. Thus, Tre alleviates ovarian aging by activating mitophagy and reducing oxidative stress, suggesting its potential as an anti-aging agent for ovarian health.",

Antibiotic treatment failure of K. pneumoniae infections has been largely attributed to acquisition of antibiotic resistance and bacterial biofilm caused by the presence of antibiotic persisters. There is an urgent need for novel antimicrobial agents or therapy strategies to manage infections caused by these notorious pathogens. In this study, we screened a collection of compounds that can dissipate bacterial proton motive force (PMF) and intermediate metabolites that can suppress antibiotic tolerance, and identified an antifungal drug sulconazole which can act in combination with glucose or trehalose to exert strong antibacterial effect against starvation-induced CR-hvKP persisters. Investigation of underlying mechanisms showed that sulconazole alone caused dissipation of transmembrane PMF, and sulconazole used in combination with glucose or trehalose could significantly inhibit the efflux activity, reduce NADH and ATP levels, and cause intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in CR-hvKP persisters, eventually resulting in bacterial cell death. These findings suggest that the sulconazole and glucose/trehalose combination is highly effective in eradicating multidrug-resistant and hypervirulent K. pneumoniae persisters, and may be used in development of a feasible strategy for treatment of chronic and recurrent K. pneumoniae infections.",

The purpose was to evaluate the protective effect and its potential mechanism of trehalose (Tre, autophagy inducer) on reproductive damage during spermiogenesis induced by BDE-209. We used 2% w/v Tre and 75 mg/kg/d BDE-209 cotreated mice for 42 days. GC-2 spd cells were cotreated with Tre, chloroquine (CQ, inhibition of autophagic flux), compound C (CC, AMPK inhibitor), and BDE-209. Tre intake significantly recovered decrease in sexual organ ratio and poor sperm quality in BDE-209-exposed mice. Supplementation with Tre rescued sperm head malformation by improving aberrant histone-protamine exchange in BDE-209-exposed mice. However, Tre intake couldn't restore the acrosome biogenesis. In addition, Tre supplementation improved testicular damage induced by BDE-209. BDE-209 blocked autophagic flux with increased P62 and LC3BⅡ/Ⅰ levels. Mechanistically, CQ treatment aggravated elevation of P62 and LC3BⅡ/Ⅰ levels induced by BDE-209, otherwise, CC and Tre treatments inhibited the rise in p-AMPK, p-ULK1, P62 and LC3BⅡ/Ⅰ levels induced by BDE-209. Tre supplementation improved reproductive injury in BDE-209-exposed mice by regulating autophagic flow via AMPK-ULK1 signaling pathways, which providing a new theoretical basis and possible therapeutic targets for male reproductive toxicity.",

In this work, the mechanism of drying temperature on the morphology and caking behavior of trehalose was investigated. When the drying temperature was too high (≥393.15 K), a large number of pores, cracks and burrs appeared on the surface of crystals. These lead to crystal fragmentation during agitated drying process. The dehydration kinetics showed that the rearrangement of the new structure after dehydration and the change of the dehydration mechanism were the reasons for the morphological changes of trehalose crystals. Caking experiments showed that the dried product exhibited higher hygroscopicity and tendency to caking. Compared with trehalose dihydrate, the product flowability decreased by 30.0 %, critical caking period decreased by 82.1 %, and caking strength increased by 13 times after high-temperature drying (413.15 K).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs) represents a powerful tool for elucidating the underlying disease mechanisms. Macular corneal dystrophy (MCD) is an intractable and progressive bilateral corneal disease affecting the corneal stroma due to mutation/s in carbohydrate sulfotransferase 6 (CHST6) gene. The underlying molecular mechanisms leading to MCD are unclear due to a lack of human contextual model and limited access to affected corneal stromal keratocytes (CSKs) from MCD patients. This has restricted the current treatment option for MCD to restorative corneal transplantation thereby lending itself to the use of iPSCs. METHODS: induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were generated from two MCD patients and a healthy participant by senai virus based reprogramming of the peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMCs). The iPSCs were characterized based on the expression of pluripotent markers and formation of embryoid bodies possessing tri-lineage potential. Directed differentiation of the iPSCs to corneal stromal keratocytes (CSKs) was done via intermediate induction of neural crest cells. The iCSKs were characterized by immunocytochemistry and qPCR. Proteostat staining of the iCSKs was done to validate the disease phenotype invitro. Expression of autophagy markers in the iCSKs and JC staining were visualized by immunochemistry and live-cell imaging in trehalose treated iCSKs. RESULTS: We show that the MCD iPSC-derived CSKs (MCDiCSKs) exhibits impaired autophagy assessed by the profiles of autophagy-associated proteins (LAMP1, LC3II/I, p62 and Beclin-1) and mitochondrial membrane potential. Significantly higher protein aggregates in MCDiCSKs was seen compared with the control, which could be rescued upon autophagy modulation. Hence, we treated MCD-iCSKs with trehalose (autophagy inducer) and showed that it protects MCD-iCSKs from mitochondrial dysfunction and maintains autophagic degradation. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the possible pathological mechanisms involved in MCD. We found trehalose ameliorate the impaired mitochondrial and autophagy dysregulation in patient iPSC-derived macular corneal dystrophy disease model, which could be a potential alternative for MCD management.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Peri-trochanteric fractures, common among the elderly with osteoporosis, pose significant morbidity and mortality risks. These fractures are increasing due to the ageing population, with Nordic countries seeing a high incidence. They present challenges for orthopaedic surgeons and can lead to functional decline and high medical costs. Hip fractures have severe consequences, including pain, immobility and increased mortality. Managing wound care is complex, involving various healing phases. Trehalose, a disaccharide with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, has shown promise in wound healing and other health conditions. Studies suggest its potential benefits in reducing inflammation and aiding wound healing in peri-trochanteric fracture patients, but more research is needed to confirm its clinical effectiveness in humans. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised clinical trial aiming to evaluate the effect of trehalose consumption on patients with peri-trochanteric fractures. The study will include 64 patients meeting specific inclusion criteria and will assess inflammatory markers and wound healing at different time points. Patients will be divided into two groups, one receiving trehalose and the other receiving a placebo for 12 weeks. Various measurements and assessments will be conducted, including biochemical assays, wound assessments, anthropometric measurements and dietary intake evaluations. Data analysis will be performed using SPSS software, and statistical tests will be used to compare outcomes between the intervention and control groups.

      "abstract": "This comprehensive review explores the pivotal roles of glycation and oxidative stress in the aging process of the skin, emphasizing their targeted therapeutic applications in aesthetic and regenerative medicine, as well as anti-aging interventions. Glycation, a biochemical process involving the non-enzymatic attachment of sugars to proteins, lipids, or nucleic acids, culminates in the formation of Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs). These AGEs are significant contributors to aging and various chronic ailments, triggering oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways, thereby manifesting as wrinkles, diminished skin elasticity, and other age-related dermal alterations. A central focus of this review is the synergistic interplay between Hyaluronic Acid (HA) and Trehalose in combating these aging mechanisms. HA, renowned for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties, assumes a pivotal role in modulating Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) levels and safeguarding against oxidative damage. Concurrently, trehalose targets glycation and oxidative stress, exhibiting promising outcomes in augmenting skin health, providing Ultraviolet B (UVB) photoprotection, and manifesting notable anti-photoaging effects. The combined administration of HA and trehalose not only addresses existing skin damage but also confers preventive and reparative benefits, particularly in stabilizing HA and mitigating glycation-induced stress. Their synergistic action significantly enhances skin quality and mitigates inflammation. The implications of these findings are profound for the future of anti-aging therapeutics in aesthetic medicine, suggesting that the integration of HA and trehalose holds promise for revolutionary advancements in preserving skin vitality and health. Moreover this paper underscores the imperative for continued research into the combined efficacy of these compounds, advocating for innovative therapeutic modalities in aesthetic medicine and enhanced strategies for combating aging, glycation, and oxidative stress."

Surimi-based products typically necessitate cold storage and a refrigerated distribution system, affecting their physical properties and flavor while escalating costs. By incorporating Transglutaminase (TGase), trehalose, and herbal oils, and optimizing the heating process using the response surface methodology, this research addresses challenges related to changes in physical properties, color, and off-flavors during high-temperature and high-pressure treatment. The addition of 0.37% ACTIVA-K TGase significantly enhanced gel strength by promoting protein cross-linking, while 0.75% trehalose improved color stability by suppressing browning, thus enhancing visual appeal. A 0.1% concentration of bay oil effectively enhanced the flavor profile by masking undesirable odors without compromising the sensory quality. Optimized processing conditions maximized DPPH radical scavenging activity, whiteness, and gel strength, ensuring superior product quality and safety. Nutritional analysis confirmed a balanced composition of moisture, protein, essential amino acids, and minerals, in accordance with Korean national standards for acid values. Microstructural examination revealed a uniform network structure, contributing to excellent texture and sensory evaluations. Shelf-life predictions indicated a storage duration of approximately 19 months, surpassing commercially available products and offering a competitive edge. This novel approach allows surimi-based products to be stored and distributed at room temperature, while also providing the potential for increased profitability."

      "abstract": "Binary mixtures of sucrose and trehalose in water were investigated using classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and free energy calculations. By classical MD simulations, the behavior of sugars was studied across the entire range of concentrations, from 0 to 100 wt % of water. Sugar-sugar and sugar-water affinities in diluted systems were in focus when using umbrella sampling and well-tempered metadynamics calculations. Moreover, in classical MD simulations, two approaches for system equilibration were applied: in the first, mixtures were preheated (using simulated annealing) before simulations under desired conditions, while in the second, no preliminary heating was used. It was discovered that sucrose has a stronger tendency to aggregate than trehalose, while the latter forms more hydrogen bonds with water. Below the concentration of 10 wt % of water, the number of hydrogen bonds between sugars is higher than the number of hydrogen bonds between sugars and water. The free energy calculations and hydrogen bonding analysis reveal certain dissimilarities in the hydration of oxygen-containing molecular groups. While there are noticeable differences in the hydration of various hydroxyl groups in sucrose and trehalose, all hydroxyl groups are clearly more hydrated than the ether oxygens in both sugars. Three factors contribute to the lower hydration of ether oxygens: they do not donate hydrogen bonds, they are slightly less polar than the oxygen atoms in hydroxyl groups, and they are less accessible to the solvent. Moreover, hydroxyl groups play the main role in binding water, and the geometry of trehalose is energetically preferable compared to the geometry of sucrose. Effects of preheating were demonstrated at water concentrations below 70 wt %, with more significant differences between mixtures observed at water concentrations below 40 wt %. Disaccharides bind stronger to each other and weaker with water molecules in preheated systems than in mixtures that were not preheated. The hydroxyl groups of sucrose and trehalose in preheated mixtures rotate slower than in systems that did not undergo thermal treatment. Therefore, while preheating is not necessary for liquid solutions, it is vital for the equilibration of samples in their amorphous solid state. In the experimental community, these findings are relevant for decision-making when choosing one of the disaccharides as a preservative."

However, the efficiency of transformation by particle bombardment has been low in wheat, and only a limited number of varieties have been transformed. In this study, replacement of maltose with trehalose as an osmolyte for high osmotic treatment for the protection of tissues from physical impacts improved callus formation in immature wheat embryos and efficiency of transformation and genome editing in varieties that are relatively poor in tissue culture response. The range of varieties amenable to biolistic transformation and genome editing may be expanded by this modification."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis, a prevalent bone metabolic disease, often requires long-term drug treatments that may lead to serious side effects. Trehalose, a natural disaccharide found in various organisms, has been shown to have a promoting effect on autophagy. However, whether trehalose can improve bone mass recovery in ovariectomized rats and its underlying mechanisms remains unclear. In this study, trehalose was administered to ovariectomized rats to evaluate its therapeutic potential for osteoporosis following ovariectomy. METHODS: Micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT), hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and immunohistochemical staining techniques were utilized to evaluate the impact of trehalose on osteoporosis induced by ovariectomy (OVX) in mice, both in imaging and histological dimensions. Furthermore, the influence of trehalose on osteoblastogenesis and functional activity was quantified through Alizarin Red S (ARS) staining and immunoblotting assays. RESULTS: Trehalose effectively mitigated bone loss, elevated autophagy and suppressed pyroptosis in ovariectomized rats. Furthermore, 3-methyladenine diminished the protective effects of trehalose, particularly in promoting autophagy and inhibiting pyroptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Trehalose demonstrates significant potential in treating osteoporosis by suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome-driven pyroptosis, primarily through autophagy promotion. This suggests that trehalose could be a promising, safer alternative treatment for osteoporosis."

Trehalose alleviates damage to the body by endowing it with stress resistance. In this study, we used trehalose combined with Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium longum, Bacillus subtilis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae to explore whether dietary intervention can alleviate oxidative stress and inflammatory damage in early lactation and to evaluate the growth ability, acid production ability, antioxidant ability, non-specific adhesion ability, antibacterial ability, and other parameters to determine the optimal combinations and proportions. The results showed that the synbiotics composed of 2.5% trehalose and 1 × 107 cfu/g of Bifidobacterium longum could regulate the gut microbiota, and promote mammary gland development in dams by reducing progesterone (PROG) content in the blood, increasing prolactin (PRL) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) content, enhancing their antioxidant and immune abilities, and effectively increasing the weight and lactation of early lactating dams. In addition, it can also affect the growth of offspring and the development of the intestinal barrier. These results indicate that trehalose synbiotics have great potential in alleviating oxidative stress and inflammatory damage in early lactation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Temperature is an important determinant of developmental and reproductive rates in insects. Here, we investigated the physiological responses of adult beet webworm, Loxostege sticticalis L. (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), to three temperatures (16, 23 and 30 °C) focusing on trehalose metabolism. RESULTS: Exposure of moths to 30 °C accelerated eclosion and ovarian development, but shortened the oviposition period and adult longevity, whereas exposure to 16 °C had opposite effects. Transcriptome analysis revealed that vitellogenin (VG) and vitellogenin receptor (VR) genes were up-regulated at 30 °C, as were numerous genes related to energy metabolism, including those involved in the insulin signaling pathway, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and glycolysis. Expression of the trehalose transporter gene TRET1 was also induced at high temperature, primarily in the ovaries, where trehalose content increased, accompanied by lipid degradation in the fat body. Treatment with the trehalase inhibitor validamycin A reduced female fecundity and longevity at 23 °C, but enhanced the expression of genes related to stress resistance and reproduction, mimicking the effect of high temperature. CONCLUSION: Besides their practical utility for predicting the oviposition behavior and geographic distribution of L. sticticalis in the field, these results elucidate the various physiological roles of trehalose in L. sticticalis during exposure of moths to high temperature and may provide insights into the relationship between stress resistance and reproduction in insects more generally. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

This study examined the neuroprotective effects of trehalose. This sugar is confined in the gut due to the absence of transporters, so we hypothesized that trehalose might exert neuroprotective effects on PD through its action on the gut microbiota. We used a transgenic mouse model of PD (PrP-A53T G2-3) overexpressing human α-synuclein and developing GI dysfunctions. Mice were given water with trehalose, maltose, or sucrose (2% w/v) for 6.5 m. Trehalose administration prevented a reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra (-25%), striatum (-38%), and gut (-18%) in PrP-A53T mice. It also modulated the gut microbiota, reducing the loss of diversity seen in PrP-A53T mice and promoting bacteria negatively correlated with PD in patients. Additionally, trehalose treatment increased the intestinal secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) by 29%. Maltose and sucrose, which break down into glucose, did not show neuroprotective effects, suggesting glucose is not involved in trehalose-mediated neuroprotection. Since trehalose is unlikely to cross the intestinal barrier at the given dose, the results suggest its effects are mediated indirectly through the gut microbiota and GLP-1.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This Systematic review aims to assess the efficacy of trehalose and hyaluronic acid in enhancing ocular recovery post-cataract surgery, focusing on their impact on tear film stability, ocular surface integrity, and patient-reported outcomes. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted across MEDLINE, PubMed, and Cochrane Library databases to identify randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of trehalose, hyaluronic acid, or their combination in post-cataract surgery care. The inclusion criteria focused on peer-reviewed studies in English, detailing outcomes relevant to ocular recovery such as tear film stability, ocular surface integrity, patient-reported discomfort, or visual acuity (VA). The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and synthesized the data qualitatively. RESULTS: Four qualitative investigations met the inclusion criteria. The studies collectively assessed the efficacy of a 3% trehalose and 0.15% hyaluronic acid eye drop solution in reducing postoperative eye symptoms compared to various control solutions. Parameters measured included tear break-up time (TBUT), Fluorescein staining, tear production (Schirmer test), and Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) scores. The results indicated significant improvements in tear film stability and ocular surface health for the treatment groups compared to controls, with a notable decrease in patient-reported discomfort. The study showed an improvement of - 18 (± 14.6) in the treatment group compared to - 7 (± 8.0) in the control group for OSDI. For TBUT, the treatment group improved by 3 (± 1.2) s, whereas the control group improved by 0.3 (± 0.71) s. VA, measured on a scale of 0-100, increased to 17 (± 0.7) in the treatment group compared to 15 (± 1.1) in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Trehalose and hyaluronic acid may be beneficial in the postoperative period by enhancing tear film stability and ocular surface health. While the results are promising, further research is needed to confirm these findings, understand the mechanisms of action, and explore broader applications.",

The ex vivo study highlights the persistence and distribution of the product at 5 and 60 min on a monolayer of conjunctival epithelial cells and an increase in microvilli density at the 60 min evaluation. In vivo examination was conducted on three subjects with different grades of ocular surface inflammation, treated with one drop of the product twice daily for thirty days. At the baseline (T0) and twelve hours after the last administration of the tear drop (T30), impression cytology of the upper bulbar conjunctiva for SEM evaluation of conjunctival epithelial cells was carried out. Slit lamp examination (SLE), corneal and conjunctival Fluotest, tear film break-up time (TBUT), and ocular surface disease index (OSDI) questionnaires were also performed to correlate the ultrastructural results with the clinical findings. After 30 days of treatment, a significant improvement in all clinical and symptomatic parameters and in the condition of the ocular surface was detected, with microvillar regeneration and strengthening in all the patients, and a complete restoration in 2/3 of them. The persistence and distribution of the product on the epithelial cells was also noted 12 h after the last administration. The results, therefore, suggest a marked epitheliotropic effect along with a high residence time of the tear substitute."

      "abstract": "Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) has conventionally been used for cell cryopreservation both in research and in clinical applications, but has long-term cytotoxic effects. Trehalose, a natural disaccharide, has been proposed as a non-toxic cryoprotectant. However, the lack of specific cell membrane transporter receptors inhibits transmembrane transport and severely limits its cryoprotective capability. This research presents a method to successfully deliver trehalose into mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) using ultrasound in the presence of microbubbles. The optimised trehalose concentration was shown to be able to not only preserve membrane integrity and cell viability but also the multipotency of MSCs, which are essential for stem cell therapy. Confocal imaging revealed that rhodamine-labelled trehalose was transported into cells rather than simply attached to the membrane. Additionally, the membranes were successfully preserved in lyophilised cells. This study demonstrates that ultrasonication with microbubbles facilitated trehalose delivery, offering promising cryoprotective capability without the cytotoxicity associated with DMSO-based methods."

      "abstract": "Cold stress severely restricts the growth and development of cold-sensitive crops. Trehalose (Tre), known as the \"sugar of life\", plays key roles in regulating plant cold tolerance by triggering antioxidation. However, the relevant regulatory mechanism remains unclear. Here, we confirmed that Tre triggers apoplastic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production and thus plays key roles in improving the cold tolerance of melon (Cucumis melo var. makuwa Makino) seedlings. Moreover, Tre treatment can promote the transport of apoplastic H2O2 to the cytoplasm. This physiological process may depend on aquaporins. Further studies showed that a Tre-responsive plasma membrane intrinsic protein 2;3 (CmPIP2;3) had strong H2O2 transport function and that silencing CmPIP2;3 significantly weakened apoplastic H2O2 transport and reduced the cold tolerance of melon seedlings. Yeast library and protein-DNA interaction technology were then used to screen 2 Tre-responsive transcription factors, abscisic acid-responsive element (ABRE)-binding factor 2 (CmABF2) and ABRE-binding factor 3 (CmABF3), which can bind to the ABRE motif of the CmPIP2;3 promoter and activate its expression. Silencing of CmABF2 and CmABF3 further dramatically increased the ratio of apoplastic H2O2/cytoplasm H2O2 and reduced the cold tolerance of melon seedlings. This study uncovered that Tre treatment induces CmABF2/3 to positively regulate CmPIP2;3 expression. CmPIP2;3 subsequently enhances the cold tolerance of melon seedlings by promoting the transport of apoplastic H2O2 into the cytoplasm for conducting redox signals and stimulating downstream antioxidation.",

Little attention has been paid to whether tumor cells themselves can undergo fibrotic transformation and whether they can inhibit parenchymal cells similar to pulmonary fibrosis, thus achieving the goal of inhibiting the malignant progression of tumors. To explore the significance of inducing tumor fibrosis for cancer treatment. This study utilizes mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) loaded with Trehalose dimycolate (TDM) to induce tumor cell fibrosis through the dual effects of TDM-induced inflammatory granuloma and MSN-induced foreign body granuloma. The results show that TDM/MSN (TM) can effectively induce tumor fibrosis, manifested specifically by collagen internalization, and suppression of proliferation and invasion capabilities, suggesting the potential role of tumor fibrosis therapy. However, further investigation reveals that extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) mediates resistance to fibrosis induction. To comprehensively enhance the efficacy, WRN exonuclease is conjugated to TM to form new nanoparticles (TMW) capable of effectively eliminating ecDNA, globally promoting tumor cell fibroblast-like transformation, and validated in a PDX model to inhibit cancer progression. Therefore, TMW, through inducing tumor cell fibrosis to inhibit its malignant progression, holds great potential as a clinical treatment strategy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Reproductive aging can adversely affect male fertility and the health of offspring. The aging process is accompanied by impaired autophagy. Recent studies have shown that Trehalose plays an important role in the prevention of various diseases by regulating autophagy. However, the roles of Trehalose in testicular aging and reproductive decline remain to be clarified. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of Trehalose on testes in an aging mouse model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, an in vivo aging model in mice by administering D-galactose was established to explore the protective effect of Trehalose on testicular aging. We examined histological changes and related indicators of apoptosis, autophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis, and sperm quality. RESULTS: D-galactose treatment induced oxidative stress, apoptosis, and impairment of autophagy of testicular cells in mouse testes. Trehalose administration significantly reduced germ cell apoptosis and DNA damage caused by D-galactose-induced oxidative stress. Notably, Trehalose activated autophagy activity and improved mitochondrial function in testicular cells. Furthermore, Trehalose treatment increased the expression level of the tight junction protein ZO-1, and accelerated clearance of damaged mitochondria in Sertoli cells, indicating that Trehalose ameliorated Sertoli cell function in D-galactose-induced aging testes. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that Trehalose administration activated the autophagy activity in testicular cells and improved mitochondrial function, thereby effectively preventing testicular aging. Trehalose and its activated autophagy are crucial for preventing testicular aging, thus restoring autophagy activity by administering Trehalose could be a promising means to delay aging.",

Neuroprotective drugs that target abnormal αSyn aggregation have not been developed for the treatment of multiple system atrophy. In addition, treating diseases at an early stage is crucial to halting the progress of neuronal damage in neurodegeneration. In this study, using early-stage multiple system atrophy mouse model and in vitro kinetic analysis, we investigated how intranasal and oral administration of trehalose can improve multiple system atrophy pathology and clinical symptoms. The multiple system atrophy model showed memory impairment at least four weeks after αSyn induction. Behavioural and physiological analyses showed that intranasal and oral administration of trehalose reversed memory impairments to near-normal levels. Notably, trehalose treatment reduced the amount of toxic αSyn and increased the aggregated form of αSyn in the multiple system atrophy model brain. In vitro kinetic analysis confirmed that trehalose accelerated the aggregate formation of αSyn. Based on our findings, we propose a novel strategy whereby accelerated αSyn aggregate formation leads to reduced exposure to toxic αSyn oligomers, particularly during the early phase of disease progression."

For that, photodynamic inactivation (PDI) is a promising approach. In this study, a tricarbocyanine (TCC) is used for the first time as a near-infrared (740 nm) activatable PDI photosensitizer to kill mycobacteria with deep light penetration. For better targeting, a novel tricarbocyanine dye functionalized with two trehalose units (TCC2Tre) is developed. The photodynamic effect of the conjugates against mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is evaluated. Under irradiation, TCC2Tre causes more effective killing of mycobacteria compared to the photosensitizer without trehalose conjugation, with 99.99% dead vegetative cells of M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis. In addition, effective photoinactivation of dormant forms of M. smegmatis is observed after incubation with TCC2Tre. Mycobacteria treated with TCC2Tre are more sensitive to 740 nm light than the Gram-positive Micrococcus luteus and the Gram-negative Escherichia coli. For the first time, this study demonstrates the proof of principle of in vitro PDI of mycobacteria including the fast-growing M. smegmatis and the slow-growing M. tuberculosis using near-infrared activatable photosensitizers conjugated with trehalose. These findings are useful for the development of new efficient alternatives to antibiotic therapy.",

In this paper, the effect of trehalose on the thermostability of β-glucosidase from low-moisture Hevea brasiliensis seeds was investigated. The results showed that the residual enzyme activities of β-glucosidase supplemented with trehalose after high-temperature treatment were significantly higher than that of the control group. The improvement of thermostability could be explained by low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at the molecular level. Moreover, adding trehalose increased the water activity and water content of β-glucosidase, leading to a more stable conformation. Trehalose replaced some water and formed a stable network of hydrogen bonds with protein and surrounding water. The glass formed by trehalose also reduced molecular movement, thus providing good protection for enzymes.",

Humanized yeast cells in which native Sod1 was replaced by wild-type human Sod1 or an ALS mutant (WT-A4V Sod1 heterodimer) were used as the experimental model. Cells were treated with 10% trehalose (p/v) before or after the appearance of hSod1 proteinopathy induced by oxidative stress. In both conditions, trehalose reduced the number of cells with Sod1 inclusions, increased Sod1 activity, and decreased the levels of intracellular oxidation, demonstrating that trehalose avoids Sod1 misfolding and loss of function in response to oxidative stress. The survival rates of ALS Sod1 cells stressed in the presence of trehalose were 60% higher than in their absence. Treatment with trehalose after the appearance of Sod1 inclusions in cells expressing WT Sod1 doubled longevity; after 5 days, non-treated cells did not survive, but 15% of cells treated with sugar were still alive. Altogether, our results emphasize the potential of trehalose as a novel therapy, which might be applied preventively in ALS patients with a family history of the disease or after diagnosis in ALS patients who discover the disease following the first symptoms."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Improvement in organ failure in intensive care unit (ICU) patients is accompanied by lower mortality rate. A disaccharide, trehalose is a candidate to improve organ failure and survival by autophagy induction and enhancing oxidative stress defense. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of trehalose in improving clinical outcome and reducing mortality in ICU patients. METHODS: a triple-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two arm, parallel-group, superiority clinical trial will enroll 200 ICU-admitted patients at Imam Reza hospital, Mashhad, Iran. The patients will be randomly allocated to receive either a 100 ml solution of 15 % trehalose or normal saline intravenously. Primary outcomes include ICU mortality and 60-day mortality, while secondary outcomes focus on blood parameters on day 5 and length of hospital/ICU stay. CONCLUSION: Trehalose has demonstrated beneficial effects in diverse patients; however, no study has evaluated its effect in all ICU-admitted patients. Consequently, this study provides an opportunity to investigate whether trehalose's anti-inflammatory effects, mediated by inducing autophagy and enhancing oxidative stress defense, can play a role in reducing mortality and improving clinical outcomes in the critically ill patients. If successful, trehalose could offer a potential therapeutic approach in the ICU setting."

      "abstract": "Pterygium is a frequent eye surface condition that is characterized by a high rate of proliferation, fibrovascular development, cellular migration, corneal infiltration, and angiogenesis. We investigated that ex vivo primary pterygium and conjunctival cell cultures were generated to analyze the effect of trehalose on cellular proliferation. After trehalose treatment, we performed microarray analysis to evaluate changes in the mRNA profile. We analyzed gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathways to identify hub genes that changed expression levels after treatment and were associated with pterygium development. We selected three genes to verify their expression levels using qRT-PCR. The study also evaluated the impact of trehalose treatment on cell migration through a wound-healing assay. Our results suggested that pterygium cell proliferation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by trehalose. 2354 DEG were identified in pterygium and conjunctiva cells treated with trehalose compared to untreated groups. Functional enrichment analysis showed that differentially expressed mRNAs are involved in proliferation, vasculature development, and cell migration. We identified ten hub genes including upregulated (RANBP3L, SLC5A3, RERG, ANKRD1, DHCR7, RAB27B, GPRC5B, MSMO1, ASPN, DRAM1) and downregulated (TNC, PTGS2, GREM2, NPTX1, NR4A1, HMOX1, CXCL12, IL6, MYH2, TXNIP). Microarray analysis and functional investigations suggest that trehalose affects the pathogenesis of pterygium by modifying the expression of genes involved in crucial pathways related to cell function.",

      "abstract": "Mangroves grow in tropical/subtropical intertidal habitats with extremely high salt tolerance. Trehalose and trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) have an alleviating function against abiotic stress. However, the roles of trehalose in the salt tolerance of salt-secreting mangrove Avicennia marina is not documented. Here, we found that trehalose was significantly accumulated in A. marina under salt treatment. Furthermore, exogenous trehalose can enhance salt tolerance by promoting the Na+ efflux from leaf salt gland and root to reduce the Na+ content in root and leaf. Subsequently, eighteen trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (AmTPS) and 11 trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (AmTPP) genes were identified from A. marina genome. Abscisic acid (ABA) responsive elements were predicted in AmTPS and AmTPP promoters by cis-acting elements analysis. We further identified AmTPS9A, as an important positive regulator, that increased the salt tolerance of AmTPS9A-overexpressing Arabidopsis thaliana by altering the expressions of ion transport genes and mediating Na+ efflux from the roots of transgenic A. thaliana under NaCl treatments. In addition, we also found that ABA could promote the accumulation of trehalose, and the application of exogenous trehalose significantly promoted the biosynthesis of ABA in both roots and leaves of A. marina. Ultimately, we confirmed that AmABF2 directly binds to the AmTPS9A promoter in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, we speculated that there was a positive feedback loop between trehalose and ABA in regulating the salt tolerance of A. marina. These findings provide new understanding to the salt tolerance of A. marina in adapting to high saline environment at trehalose and ABA aspects.",

      "abstract": "Sweet potato [Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam], the crop with the seventh highest annual production globally, is susceptible to various adverse environmental influences, and the study of stress-resistant genes is important for improving its tolerance to abiotic stress. The enzyme trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) is indispensable in the one pathway for synthesizing trehalose in plants. TPS is known to participate in stress response in plants, but information on TPS in sweet potato is limited. This study produced the N-terminal truncated IbTPS1 gene (△NIbTPS1) overexpression lines of Arabidopsis thaliana and sweet potato. Following salt and mannitol-induced drought treatment, the germination rate, root elongation, and fresh weight of the transgenic A. thaliana were significantly higher than that in the wild type. Overexpression of △NIbTPS1 elevated the photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm) and the activity of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase in sweet potato during drought and salt treatments, while reducing malondialdehyde and O2∙- contents, although expression of the trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase gene IbTPP and trehalose concentrations were not affected. Thus, overexpressing the △NIbTPS1 gene can improve the stress tolerance of sweet potato to drought and salt by enhancing the photosynthetic efficiency and antioxidative enzyme system. These results will contribute to understand the functions of the △NIbTPS1 gene and trehalose in the response mechanism of higher plants to abiotic stress.",

There are no suitable therapeutic options for this disease. Autophagy, a defense mechanism against the toxic effects of aggregation-prone misfolded proteins, has been shown to have beneficial effects on neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, trehalose, which is an autophagy inducer, may have beneficial effects on SCA3. In the present study, we examined the effects of trehalose on an SCA3 cell model. After trehalose treatment, aggregate formation, soluble ataxin-3 protein levels and cell viability were evaluated in HEK293T cells overexpressing ataxin-3-15Q or ataxin-3-77Q. We also explored the mechanism by which trehalose affects autophagy and stress pathways. A filter trap assay showed that trehalose decreased the number of aggregates formed by mutant ataxin-3 containing an expanded polyQ tract. Western blot and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) results demonstrated that trehalose also reduced the ataxin-3 protein levels and was safe for ataxin-3-expressing cells, respectively. Western blot and total antioxidant capacity assays suggested that trehalose had great therapeutic potential for treating SCA3, likely through its antioxidant activity. Our data indicate that trehalose plays a neuroprotective role in SCA3 by inhibiting the aggregation and reducing the protein level of ataxin-3, which is also known to protect against oxidative stress. These findings provide a new insight into the possibility of treating SCA3 with trehalose and highlight the importance of inducing autophagy in SCA3.",

We studied the effects of different regimens of dietary trehalose treatment in an amyloid-β (Aβ) 25-35-induced murine model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ-treated mice received 2% trehalose solution daily, 4% trehalose solution daily (continuous mode) or every other day (intermittent mode), to drink for two weeks. We revealed the dose-dependent effects on autophagy activation in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, and the restoration of behavioral disturbances. A continuous intake of 4% trehalose solution caused the greatest activation of autophagy and the complete recovery of step-through latency in the passive avoidance test that corresponds to associative long-term memory and learning. This regimen also produced an anxiolytic effect in the open field. The effects of all the regimens studied were similar in Aβ load, neuroinflammatory response, and neuronal density in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. Trehalose successfully restored these parameters to the levels of the control group. Thus, high doses of trehalose had increased efficacy towards cognitive impairment in a model of early AD-like pathology. These findings could be taken into account for translational studies and the development of clinical approaches for AD therapy using trehalose."

The sulfakinin family, an insect analogue of the mammalian satiety factor cholecystokinin (CCK), has been shown to suppress food intake in various insects. Nevertheless, the mechanisms through which sulfakinin regulates feeding behavior remain a biological question. This study aimed to elucidate the signaling pathway mediated by the anorexigenic peptide sulfakinin in Bombyx mori. We identified the Bombyx mori neuropeptide G protein-coupled receptor A9 (BNGR-A9) as the receptor for sulfakinin through functional assays. Stimulation with sulfakinin triggered a swift increase in intracellular IP3, Ca2+, and a notable enhancement of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, in a manner sensitive to a Gαq-specific inhibitor. Treatment with synthetic sulfakinin resulted in decreased food consumption and average body weight. Additionally, administering synthetic sulfakinin to silkworms significantly elevated hemolymph trehalose levels, an effect markedly reduced by pre-treatment with BNGR-A9 dsRNA. Consequently, our findings establish the sulfakinin/BNGR-A9 signaling pathway as a critical regulator of feeding behavior and hemolymph trehalose homeostasis in Bombyx mori, highlighting its roles in the negative control of food intake and the positive regulation of energy balance.",

This study was designed to test formally evaluate whether oral trehalose was effective in SCA3 patients. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, SCA3 patients received either 100 g oral trehalose or 30 g maltose to improve ataxia severity over six months. We also measured other clinical (non-ataxia), patient-reported (quality of life, motivations), and safety endpoints. An unscheduled interim analysis was conducted using two-way ANOVAs to analyze the interaction between time (baseline, 3-months, 6-months) and intervention (Trehalose vs. Placebo). RESULTS: Fifteen participants (Trehalose = 7 vs. Placebo = 8) completed the study at the time of interim analysis. There was no interaction effect on the ataxia severity, and available data suggested an estimated sample size of 132 (66 per arm) SCA3 patients required to demonstrate changes in a 6-month trial. There were significant interaction effects for executive function (ƞ2 = 0.28-0.43). Safety data indicated that 100 g oral trehalose was well-tolerated. CONCLUSION: We performed an unplanned interim analysis due to a slow recruitment rate. The new estimated sample size was deemed unfeasible, leading to premature termination of the clinical trial. In this small, current sample of SCA3 patients, 100 g oral trehalose did not differentially impact on ataxia severity compared to placebo. Interestingly, our findings may suggest an improvement in executive function. Future efforts will require a large multi-country, multi-center study to investigate the potential effect of trehalose.",

Therefore, this study aimed to explore the effectiveness of trehalose and mannitol induce salt resistance in wheat seedlings. Wheat grains of the commercial variety Sakha 94 were divided into three groups : a group that was pre-soaked in 10 mM trehalose, another group was soaked in 10 mM mannitol, and the last was soaked in distilled water for 1 hour, then the pre soaked grains cultivated in sandy soil, each treatment was divided into two groups, one of which was irrigated with 150 mM NaCl and the other was irrigated with tap water. The results showed that phenols content in wheat seedlings increased and flavonoids reduced due to salt stress. Trehalose and mannitol cause slight increase in total phenols content while total flavonoids were elevated highy in salt-stressed seedlings. Furthermore, Trehalose or mannitol reduced salt-induced lipid peroxidation. Salt stress increases antioxidant enzyme activities of guaiacol peroxidase (G-POX), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and catalase (CAT) in wheat seedlings, while polyphenol oxidase (PPO) unchanged. Trehalose and mannitol treatments caused an increase in APX, and CAT activities, whereas G-POX not altered but PPO activity were decreased under salt stress conditions. Molecular docking confirmed the interaction of Trehalose or mannitol with peroxidase and ascorbic peroxidase enzymes. Phenyl alanine ammonia layase (PAL) activity was increased in salt-stressed seedlings. We can conclude that pre-soaking of wheat grains in 10 mM trehalose or mannitol improves salinity stress tolerance by enhancing antioxidant defense enzyme and/or phenol biosynthesis, with docking identifying interactions with G-POX, CAT, APX, and PPO.",

      "abstract": "Trehalose is known to protect enzymes from denaturation. In the present study, we observed promotion of apple polyphenol oxidase (PPO) inactivation in a trehalose solution with thermal treatment. Crude PPO from Fuji apple was mixed with either sucrose or trehalose solutions, then the samples treated at 25 or 65 °C. In the presence of trehalose, PPO activities were markedly decreased upon treatment at 65 °C with increasing trehalose concentration. Furthermore, the reduction in PPO activity in the presence of trehalose was proportional to storage time after thermal treatment and thermal treatment time. Comparing PPO activities between treatment time 0 and 90 min at 65 °C, activities decreased 89 % for trehalose concentration of 0.2 M. These results indicates that trehalose acts not only as inhibitor but as promoter of inactivation of PPO. The Lineweaver-Burk plot indicated that trehalose acts on PPO as a non-competitive inhibitor during the 65 °C treatment. Two mechanisms of PPO inactivation in the presence of trehalose were suggested; one is the suppression of PPO activation cause by a thermal treatment, and another is the conformational change to inactivation form of PPO in conjunction with trehalose and a thermal treatment. Additionally, apple juice including 0.2 or 0.5 M trehalose with 65 °C treatment indicated slow browning than the juice with 0.2 or 0.5 M sucrose or without sugars. This result demonstrates that the preventing of browning with trehalose is a viable industrial food process."

      "abstract": "The burgeoning issue of landfill leachate, exacerbated by urbanization, necessitates evaluating its biological impact, traditionally overshadowed by physical and chemical assessments. This study harnesses Caenorhabditis elegans, a model organism, to elucidate the physiological toxicity of landfill leachate subjected to different treatment processes: nanofiltration reverse osmosis tail water (NFRO), membrane bioreactor (MBR), and raw leachate (RAW). Our investigation focuses on the modulation of sugar metabolism, particularly trehalose-a disaccharide serving dual functions as an energy source and an anti-adversity molecule in invertebrates. Upon exposure, C. elegans showcased a 60-70% reduction in glucose and glycogen levels alongside a significant trehalose increase, highlighting an adaptive response to environmental stress by augmenting trehalose synthesis. Notably, trehalose-related genes in the NFRO group were up-regulated, contrasting with the MBR and RAW groups, where trehalose synthesis genes outpaced decomposition genes by 20-30 times. These findings suggest that C. elegans predominantly counters landfill leachate-induced stress through trehalose accumulation. This research not only provides insights into the differential impact of leachate treatment methods on C. elegans but also proposes a molecular framework for assessing the environmental repercussions of landfill leachate, contributing to the development of novel strategies for pollution mitigation and environmental preservation.",

      "abstract": "It is well known that application of exogenous trehalose can enhance the heat resistance of plants. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms by which exogenous trehalose induces heat resistance in C. sinensis, a combination of physiological and transcriptome analyses was conducted. The findings revealed a significant increase in the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) upon treatment with 5.0 mM trehalose at different time points. Moreover, the contents of proline (PRO), endogenous trehalose, and soluble sugar exhibited a significant increase, while malondialdehyde (MDA) content decreased following treatment with 5.0 mM trehalose under 24 h high-temperature stress (38 °C/29 °C, 12 h/12 h). RNA-seq analysis demonstrated that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in the MAPK pathway, plant hormone signal transduction, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, flavone and flavonol biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, and the galactose metabolism pathway. The capability to scavenge free radicals was enhanced, and the expression of a heat shock factor gene (HSFB2B) and two heat shock protein genes (HSP18.1 and HSP26.5) were upregulated in the tea plant. Consequently, it was concluded that exogenous trehalose contributes to alleviating heat stress in C. sinensis. Furthermore, it regulates the expression of genes involved in diverse pathways crucial for C. sinensis under heat-stress conditions. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the alleviation of heat stress in C. sinensis with trehalose."

      "abstract": "Peach fruit is prone to chilling injury (CI) during low-temperature storage, resulting in quality deterioration and economic losses. Our previous studies have found that exogenous trehalose treatment can alleviate the CI symptoms of peach by increasing sucrose accumulation. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential molecular mechanism of trehalose treatment in alleviating CI in postharvest peach fruit. Transcriptome analysis showed that trehalose induced gene expression in pathways of plant MAPK signaling, calcium signaling, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis indicated that PpCDPK24 may activate the ROS signaling pathway by phosphorylating PpRBOHE. Besides, PpWRKY40 mediates the activation of PpMAPKKK2-induced ROS signaling pathway by interacting with the PpRBOHE promoter. Accordingly, trehalose treatment significantly enhanced the activities of antioxidant-related enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and gluathione reductase (GR), as well as the transcription levels AsA-GSH cycle related gene, which led to the reduction of H2O2 and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in peach during cold storage. In summary, our results suggest that the potential molecular mechanism of trehalose treatment is to enhance antioxidant capacity by activating CDPK-mediated Ca2 + -ROS signaling pathway and WRKY-mediated MAPK-WRKY-ROS signaling pathway, thereby reducing the CI in peach fruit.",

CAP uses ionized gas to induce lethal oxidative stress on cancer cells; however, the efficacy of CAP therapy continues to be improved. Here, we report an injectable hydrogel-mediated approach to enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of CAP by regulating the phosphorylation of eIF2α. We discovered that reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), two main anti-tumor components in CAP, can lead to lethal oxidative stress on tumor cells. Elevated oxidative stress subsequently induces eIF2α phosphorylation, a pathognomonic marker of immunogenic cell death (ICD). Trehalose, a natural disaccharide sugar, can further enhance CAP-induced ICD by elevating the phosphorylation of eIF2α. Moreover, injectable hydrogel-mediated delivery of CAP/trehalose treatment promoted dendritic cell (DC) maturation, initiating tumor-specific T-cell mediated anti-tumor immune responses. The combination therapy also supported the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages to an M1-like phenotype, reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and promoting tumor antigen presentation to T cells. In combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (i.e., anti-programmed cell death protein 1 antibody, aPD1), CAP/trehalose therapy further inhibited tumor growth. Importantly, our findings also indicated that this hydrogel-mediated local combination therapy engaged the host systemic innate and adaptive immune systems to impair the growth of distant tumors.",

Trehalose, an autophagy inducer, has been shown to be cardioprotective in an ischemia-reperfusion (IR) model; however, its role in IR injury in DCD remains unknown. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of trehalose on cardiomyocyte viability and autophagy activation in a DCD model. In the DCD model, cardiomyocytes (H9C2) were exposed to 1 h warm ischemia, 1 h cold ischemia, and 1 h reperfusion. Trehalose was administered before cold ischemia (preconditioning), during cold ischemia, or during reperfusion. Cell viability was measured using the Cell Counting Kit-8 after treatment with trehalose. Autophagy activation was evaluated by measuring autophagy flux using an autophagy inhibitor, chloroquine, and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3 B (LC3)-II by western blotting. Trehalose administered before the ischemic period (trehalose preconditioning) increased cell viability. The protective effects of trehalose preconditioning on cell viability were negated by chloroquine treatment. Furthermore, trehalose preconditioning increased autophagy flux. Trehalose preconditioning increased cardiomyocyte viability through the activation of autophagy in a DCD model, which could be a promising strategy for the prevention of cardiomyocyte damage in DCD transplantation."

However, drug development for Aβ42 toxicity has been progressed slowly. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to introduce the effect and related mechanism of trehalose on an Aβarc (arctic mutant Aβ42) Drosophila AD model. METHODS: The human Aβarc was expressed in Drosophila to construct the AD model. Trehalose was added to the culture vial. The movement ability was determined by detecting climbing ability and flight ability. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect the levels of Aβarc, ATP, and lactate. Electron microscopy assay, mitochondrial membrane potential assay, and mitochondrial respiration assay were used to assess the mitochondrial structure and function. RESULTS: Trehalose strongly improved the movement ability of Aβarc Drosophila in a concentration gradient-dependent manner. Furthermore, trehalose increased the content of ATP and decreased the content of Aβarc and lactate both in the brain and thorax of Aβarc Drosophila. More importantly, the mitochondrial structure and function were greatly improved by trehalose treatment in Aβarc Drosophila. CONCLUSION: Trehalose improves movement ability at least partly by reducing the Aβarc level and restoring the mitochondrial structure and function in Aβarc Drosophila."

      "abstract": "Swainsonine (SW) is the main toxic component of locoweed. Previous studies have shown that kidney damage is an early pathologic change in locoweed poisoning in animals. Trehalose induces autophagy and alleviates lysosomal damage, while its protective effect and mechanism against the toxic injury induced by SW is not clear. Based on the published literature, we hypothesize that transcription factor EB(TFEB) -regulated is targeted by SW and activating TFEB by trehalose would reverse the toxic effects. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of protective effects of trehalose using renal tubular epithelial cells. The results showed that SW induced an increase in the expression level of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II and p62 proteins and a decrease in the expression level of ATPase H+ transporting V1 Subunit A, Cathepsin B, Cathepsin D, lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 and TFEB proteins in renal tubular epithelial cells in a time and dose-dependent manner suggesting TFEB-regulated lysosomal pathway is adversely affected by SW. Conversely, treatment with trehalose, a known activator of TFEB promote TFEB nuclear translocation suggesting that TFEB plays an important role in protection against SW toxicity. We demonstrated in lysosome staining that SW reduced the number of lysosomes and increased the luminal pH, while trehalose could counteract these SW-induced effects. In summary, our results demonstrated for the first time that trehalose could alleviate the autophagy degradation disorder and lysosomal damage induced by SW. Our results provide an interesting method for reversion of SW-induced toxicity in farm animals and furthermore, activation of TFEB by trehalose suggesting novel mechanism of treating lysosomal storage diseases.",

      "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is the leading cause of death worldwide by infectious disease. Treatment of Mtb infection requires a six-month course of multiple antibiotics, an extremely challenging regimen necessitated by Mtb's ability to form drug-tolerant persister cells. Mtb persister formation is dependent on the trehalose catalytic shift, a stress-responsive metabolic remodeling mechanism in which the disaccharide trehalose is liberated from cell surface glycolipids and repurposed as an internal carbon source to meet energy and redox demands. Here, using a biofilm-persister model, metabolomics, and cryo-electron microscopy (EM), we found that azidodeoxy- and aminodeoxy-d-trehalose analogues block the Mtb trehalose catalytic shift through inhibition of trehalose synthase TreS (Rv0126), which catalyzes the isomerization of trehalose to maltose. Out of a focused eight-member compound panel constructed by chemoenzymatic synthesis, the natural product 2-trehalosamine exhibited the highest potency and significantly potentiated first- and second-line TB drugs in broth culture and macrophage infection assays. We also report the first structure of TreS bound to a substrate analogue inhibitor, obtained via cryo-EM, which revealed conformational changes likely essential for catalysis and inhibitor binding that can potentially be exploited for future therapeutic development. Our results demonstrate that inhibition of the trehalose catalytic shift is a viable strategy to target Mtb persisters and advance trehalose analogues as tools and potential adjunctive therapeutics for investigating and targeting mycobacterial persistence.",

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of oleic acid and trehalose added to ram semen extender on sperm parameters, lipid peroxidation (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme levels of spermatozoa following the freeze/thawing processes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ejaculates were collected from four rams and pooled at 35 degree C. Pooled ejaculates were diluted with oleic acid at 0 mM and trehalose at 0 mM (O0 T0) as the control. The Tris-based extender was supplemented with either 0.5 (O0.5) or 1 (O1) mM of oleic acid or 25 (T25) or 50 (T50) mM of trehalose alone, and in combination [0.5 mM oleic acid + 25 mM trehalose (O0.5 T25), 0.5 mM oleic acid + 50 mM trehalose (O0.5 T50), 1 mM oleic acid + 25 mM trehalose (O1 T25) and 1 mM oleic acid + 50 mM trehalose (O1 T50)]. The semen was frozen by the traditional liquid nitrogen vapour method and stored at -196C in the liquid nitrogen tank. RESULTS: Semen extender containing O1T25 significantly improved the total motility, when compared with other treatment groups (P<0.05), except for O1 T50. O1 T50 had a higher viability rate than any other treatment. The addition of O1 T25 and O1 T50 increased DNA and membrane integrity of spermatozoa post-thawing compared to other treatments (P<0.05). The level of MDA was significantly (P<0.05) lower in extenders supplemented with O1, O0.5 T25, O0.5 T50, O1 T25 and O1T50 compared to the other treatment groups. In addition, SOD levels were higher in groups treated with O1 T25 and O1 T50 than the other treatment groups (P<0.05).

Objectives: To examine the presence of TDM in clinical isolates obtained from patients with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) pulmonary disease (PD) and its impact on disease severity and treatment outcomes. Methods: We analyzed clinical isolates from patients with diagnoses of MAC PD at Seoul National University Hospital between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2021. The lipids were extracted from clinical isolates obtained at the time of diagnosis using mass spectrometry. Mass peaks between 300 and 3,500 m/z were obtained, and the peak patterns of the total lipids were analyzed. Results: TDM was identified in clinical isolates from 176 of 343 patients. Cavities were more prevalent in patients with TDM-negative isolates (19.8%) than in those with TDM-positive isolates (10.2%) (P = 0.015). The time to antibiotic treatment was shorter in patients with TDM-negative isolates (4 mo [interquartile range, 2-10 mo]) than in those with TDM-positive isolates (7 mo [interquartile range, 3-16 mo]) (P = 0.032). Patients with TDM-negative isolates had a significantly lower proportion of culture conversions (P = 0.012). TDM was associated with higher likelihood of culture conversion (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.29; P = 0.035). Conclusions: TDM-negative isolates were linked to a higher occurrence of cavities, earlier initiation of treatment, and worse treatment outcome in patients with MAC PD.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) could establish symbiosis with plant roots, which enhances plant resistance to various stresses, including drought stress and salt stress. Besides AMF, chemical stimulants such as trehalose (Tre) can also play an important role in helping plants alleviate damage of adversity. However, the mechanism of the effect of AMF combined with chemicals on plant stress resistance is unclear. The objective of this study was to explore the synergistic effects of Claroideoglomus etunicatum AMF and exogenous Tre on the antioxidant system, osmoregulation, and resistance-protective substance in plants in response to salt stress. Tomato seedlings were inoculated with Claroideoglomus etunicatum and combined with exogenous Tre in a greenhouse aseptic soil cultivation experiment. We measured the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiont development, organic matter content, and antioxidant enzyme activity in tomato seedlings. Both AMF and Tre improved the synthesis of chlorophyll content in tomato seedlings; regulated the osmotic substance including soluble sugars, soluble protein, and proline of plants; and increased the activity of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase. The combination of AMF and Tre also reduced the accumulation of malondialdehyde and alleviated the damage of harmful substances to plant cells in tomato seedlings. We studied the effects of AMF combined with extraneous Tre on salt tolerance in tomato seedlings, and the results showed that the synergistic treatment of AMF and Tre was more efficient than the effects of AMF inoculation or Tre spraying separately by regulating host substance synthesis, osmosis, and antioxidant enzymes. Our results indicated that the synergistic effects of AMF and Tre increased the plant adaptability against salt damage by enhancing cell osmotic protection and cell antioxidant capacity. IMPORTANCE: AMF improve the plant adaptability to salt resistance by increasing mineral absorption and reducing the damage of saline soil. Trehalose plays an important role in plant response to salt damage by regulating osmotic pressure. Together, the use of AMF and trehalose in tomato seedlings proved efficient in regulating host substance synthesis, osmosis, and antioxidant enzymes. These synergistic effects significantly improved seedling adaptability to salt stress by enhancing cell osmotic protection and cell antioxidant capacity, ultimately reducing losses to crops grown on land where salinization has occurred.",

In the current study, two rice cultivars differing in drought tolerance were used to analyse the role of trehalose in modulating photosynthesis and ROS-antioxidant balance leading to improvement in drought tolerance. Accumulation of trehalose in leaves of Vaisakh (drought-tolerant) and Aiswarya (drought-sensitive) rice cultivars was observed by spraying 50 mM trehalose and 100 µM validamycin A (trehalase inhibitor) followed by vacuum infiltration. Compared to stress sensitive Aiswarya cultivar, higher trehalose levels were observed in leaves of Vaisakh not only under control conditions but also under drought conditions corresponding with increased root length. The increase in leaf trehalose by treatment with trehalose or validamycin A corresponded well with a decrease in electrolyte leakage in sensitive and tolerant plants. Decreased ROS levels were reflected as increase in antioxidant enzyme activity and their gene expression in leaves of both the cultivars treated with trehalose or Validamycin A under control and drought conditions signifying the importance of trehalose in modulating the ROS-antioxidant balance for cellular protection. Further, higher chlorophyll, higher photosynthetic activity and modulation in other gas exchange parameters upon treatment with trehalose or validamycin A strongly suggested the beneficial role of trehalose for stress tolerance. Trehalose accumulation helped the tolerant cultivar adjust towards drought by maintaining higher water status and alleviating the ROS toxicity by effective activation and increment in antioxidant enzyme activity along with enhanced photosynthesis.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP) is an essential enzyme catalyzing trehalose synthesis, an important regulatory factor for plant development and stress response in higher plants. However, the TPP gene family in soybean has not been reported. RESULTS: A comprehensive analysis of the TPP gene family identified 18 GmTPPs classified into eight groups based on the phylogenetic relationships and the conservation of protein in six monocot and eudicot plants. The closely linked subfamilies had similar motifs and intron/exon numbers. Segmental duplication was the main driving force of soybean GmTPPs expansion. In addition, analysis of the cis-regulatory elements and promoter regions of GmTPPs revealed that GmTPPs regulated the response to several abiotic stresses. Moreover, RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analysis of the tissue-specific GmTPPs under different abiotic stresses revealed that most GmTPPs were associated with response to different stresses, including cold, drought, saline-alkali, and exogenous trehalose. Notably, exogenous trehalose treatment up-regulated the expression of most TPP genes under saline-alkali conditions while increasing the carbohydrate and trehalose levels and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in soybean sprouts, especially in the saline-alkali tolerant genotype. Furthermore, the interaction network and miRNA target prediction revealed that GmTPPs interacted with abiotic stress response-related transcription factors. CONCLUSIONS: The findings in this study lay a foundation for further functional studies on TPP-based breeding to improve soybean development and stress tolerance.",

A systematic review that included only full-length randomized controlled studies (RCTs) reporting the effects of trehalose tear-substitute treatment in three databases, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science, was performed according to the PRISMA statement. The search period included papers published before 8 August 2023. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to analyze the quality of the studies selected. A total of 10 RCTs were included in this systematic review. Trehalose tear-substitute treatments achieved a higher improvement than did control group interventions in all reported variables. The mean differences between both groups were in favor of trehalose, and were as follows: ocular surface disease index (OSDI) questionnaire score of -8.5 ± 7 points, tear film breakup time (TBUT) of 1.9 ± 1 s, tear film thickness (TFT) of 0.25 ± 0.1 μm, tear meniscus height (TMH) of 0.02 ± 0.02 mm, Schirmer test (ST) of 0.8 ± 1.4 mm, corneal fluorescein staining (CFS) of -0.7 ± 0.1 points and visual acuity (VA) of 0.3 ± 2.1 letters. No adverse events after trehalose tear-substitute treatments were reported. Trehalose tear substitutes are a safe and effective treatment for DED. Therefore, trehalose tear substitutes should be recommended for patients with dry eye disease. In addition, there is specific evidence to support its use in the preoperative cataract surgery period."

      "abstract": "Atherosclerosis, cholesterol-driven plaque formation in arteries, is a complex multicellular disease which is a leading cause of vascular diseases. During the progression of atherosclerosis, the autophagic function is impaired, resulting in lipid accumulation-mediated foam cell formation. The stimulation of autophagy is crucial for the recovery of cellular recycling process. One of the potential autophagy inducers is trehalose, a naturally occurring non-reducing disaccharide. However, trehalose has poor bioavailability due to its hydrophilic nature which results in poor penetration through cell membranes. To enhance its bioavailability, we developed trehalose-releasing nanogels (TNG) for the treatment of atherosclerosis. The nanogels were fabricated through copolymerization of 6-O-acryloyl-trehalose with the selected acrylamide-type monomers affording a high trehalose conjugation (~ 58%, w/w). TNG showed a relatively small hydrodynamic diameter (dH, 67 nm) and a uniform spherical shape and were characterized by negative ζ potential (-18 mV). Thanks to the trehalose-rich content, TNG demonstrated excellent colloidal stability in biological media containing serum and were non-hemolytic to red blood cells. In vitro study confirmed that TNG could stimulate autophagy in foam cells and enhance lipid efflux and in vivo study in ApoE-/- mice indicated a significant reduction in atherosclerotic plaques, while increasing autophagic markers. In conclusion, TNG hold great promise as a trehalose delivery system to restore impaired autophagy-mediated lipid efflux in atherosclerosis and subsequently reduce atherosclerotic plaques.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Trehalose is a naturally occurring disaccharide of 2 glucose molecules, which has been suggested as a potential therapeutic agent to reduce blood glucose and ameliorate diabetes-related complications in type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study aimed to determine the efficacy of medium-term trehalose treatment in patients with T2D. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 40 patients with T2D was undertaken; 20 ingested trehalose 3.3 g/day and 20 placebo (sucrose), for 3 months. Parameters of glycaemic indices, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), mood status, and quality of life were measured. RESULTS: CRP was significantly lower with trehalose treatment (-0.62 ±0.3 mg/l, p = 0.02); however, no differences in glycaemic indices of fasting blood glucose (FBG) (-7.1 ±10.7 mg/dl, p = 0.15), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (-0.1 ±0.4%, p = 0.73), insulin (0.73 ±0.8 μU/ml, p = 0.39), or insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (0.19 ±0.33, p = 0.56) were seen between groups after 12 weeks. Depression and stress scores were lower with trehalose compared to the placebo group (p = 0.02 and p = 0.05, respectively), whilst the quality-of-life score was higher with trehalose compared to placebo (p = 0.03) at the end of study. Between-group differences in these indices did not reach statistical significance (-2.36 ±1.20, -2.21 ±1.39 and 3.00 ±1.76 for depression, stress, and quality-of-life score, respectively) (p > 0.05). The pro-oxidant antioxidant balance (PAB) did not differ between groups (-4.6 ±12.8, p = 0.72). CONCLUSIONS: 12 weeks of treatment with 3.3 g/day of oral trehalose significantly improves CRP as a marker of inflammation, with potential favourable effects on quality of life, depression, and stress levels, but overall glycaemic control and pro-oxidant-antioxidant balance were unaltered during this time frame."

      "abstract": "Accumulation of misfolded proteins compromises overall cellular health and fitness. The failure to remove misfolded proteins is a critical reason for their unwanted aggregation in dense cellular protein pools. The accumulation of various inclusions serves as a clinical feature for neurodegenerative diseases. Previous findings suggest that different cellular compartments can store these abnormal inclusions. Studies of transgenic mice and cellular models of neurodegenerative diseases indicate that depleted chaperone capacity contributes to the aggregation of damaged or aberrant proteins, which consequently disturb proteostasis and cell viability. However, improving these abnormal proteins' selective elimination is yet to be well understood. Still, molecular strategies that can promote the effective degradation of abnormal proteins without compromising cellular viability are unclear. Here, we reported that the trehalose treatment elevates endogenous proteasome levels and enhances the activities of the proteasome. Trehalose-mediated proteasomal activation elevates the removal of both bona fide misfolded and various neurodegenerative disease-associated proteins. Our current study suggests that trehalose may retain a proteasome activation potential, which seems helpful in the solubilization of different mutant misfolded proteins, improving cell viability. These results reveal a possible molecular approach to reduce the overload of intracellular misfolded proteins, and such cytoprotective functions may play a critical role against protein conformational diseases.",

      "abstract": "Lysosomes play important roles in catabolism, nutrient sensing, metabolic signaling, and homeostasis. NPC1 deficiency disrupts lysosomal function by inducing cholesterol accumulation that leads to early neurodegeneration in Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease. Mitochondria pathology and deficits in NPC1 deficient cells are associated with impaired lysosomal proteolysis and metabolic signaling. It is thought that activation of the transcription factor TFEB, an inducer of lysosome biogenesis, restores lysosomal-autophagy activity in lysosomal storage disorders. Here, we investigated the effect of trehalose, a TFEB activator, in the mitochondria pathology of NPC1 mutant fibroblasts in vitro and in mouse developmental Purkinje cells ex vivo. We found that in NPC1 mutant fibroblasts, serum starvation or/and trehalose treatment, both activators of TFEB, reversed mitochondria fragmentation to a more tubular mitochondrion. Trehalose treatment also decreased the accumulation of Filipin+ cholesterol in NPC1 mutant fibroblasts. However, trehalose treatment in cerebellar organotypic slices (COSCs) from wild-type and Npc1nmf164 mice caused mitochondria fragmentation and lack of dendritic growth and degeneration in developmental Purkinje cells. Our data suggest, that although trehalose successfully restores mitochondria length and decreases cholesterol accumulation in NPC1 mutant fibroblasts, in COSCs, Purkinje cells mitochondria and dendritic growth are negatively affected possibly through the overactivation of the TFEB-lysosomal-autophagy pathway.",

Trehalose has also been demonstrated to preserve the protein's structural integrity and to limit the aggregation of pathologically misfolded proteins. Both of these properties have made trehalose a promising therapeutic candidate to target autophagy-related disorders and protein aggregation diseases. Unfortunately, trehalose has poor bioavailability due to its hydrophilic nature and susceptibility to enzymatic degradation. Recently, trehalose-bearing carriers, in which trehalose is incorporated either by chemical conjugation or physical entrapment, have emerged as an alternative option to free trehalose to improve its efficacy, particularly for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, atherosclerosis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and cancers.

This study realized the simultaneous fractionation, desalination, and dye removal/recovery treatment of textile wastewater by using trehalose (Tre) as an aqueous monomer to prepare polyester loose nanofiltration (LNF) membrane with fine control microstructure via interfacial polymerization. Outperforming the NF270 commercial membrane, the Tre-1.05/TMC optimized membrane achieves zero-discharge textile wastewater treatment, cutting energy consumption by 295% and reducing water consumption by 42.8%. This efficiency surge results from remarkable water permeability (130.83 L m-2 h-1 bar-1) and impressive dye desalination (NaCl/ Direct Red 23 separation factor of 275) of the Tre-1.05/TMC membrane. For a deeper comprehension of filtration performance, the sieving mechanism of polyester LNF membranes was systematically elucidated. This strategic approach offers significant prospects for energy conservation, carbon emission mitigation, and enhanced feasibility of membrane-based wastewater treatment systems."

During the filling period, we analyzed the effects of exogenous trehalose (10, 15 and 20 mmol·L-1) on the filling characteristics and sugar fraction under high temperature, with no spraying at ordinary temperature as control (CK). The results showed that treating without spraying exogenous trehalose at high temperature (H) significantly reduced wheat grain yield and grain weight during the filling period, and spraying exogenous trehalose alleviated the reduction of grain yield and grain weight at the filling stage under high temperature stress. Compared with the H treatment, grain yield and grain weight of HM33 and FM5 wheat varie-ties increased by 3.5%, 6.7% and 4.2%, 5.4%, respectively. High temperature stress significantly increased the trehalose content and trehalase (THL) activity in flag leaves of both wheat varieties, and decreased the fructose and glucose contents. Spraying exogenous trehalose increased the contents of trehalose, fructose, and glucose in flag leaves, and decreased the trehalase activity in flag leaves compared with H treatment, which could improve the glucose metabolism capacity of wheat at filling stage. The increasing effect of FM5 was higher than that of HM33. High temperature stress significantly reduced starch content of flag leaves and grains, while spraying exogenous trehalose alleviated the decrease of starch content of flag leaves and grains under high temperature stress, which was profit able for the substance accumulation of wheat grains under high temperature stress. Under the conditions of this experiment, spraying 15 mmol·L-1 trehalose at flowering stage was the best treatment for the two wheat varieties.",

Here, this study explores the mechanism of re-regulated drought tolerance during cucumber adventitious root formation. Our results indicate that 2 mM Tre displays remarkable drought alleviation in the aspect of root number, root length, fresh weight, and dry weight. Under drought stress, Tre could inhibit greatly the MDA, H2O2, and O2- accumulation, enhance obviously the activities of SOD, POD, and CAT enzymes and up-regulate significantly the transcript levels of SOD, POD, and CAT genes. Furthermore, Tre treatment also promotes Tre metabolism during drought stress: significantly increases starch and Tre contents and decreases glucose content, the biosynthesis enzymatic activity of the Tre metabolic pathway including TPS and TPP are enhanced and the activity of degradation enzyme THL is decreased, and corresponding genes TPS1, TPS2, TPPA, and TPPB are up-regulated. Tre significantly reversed the decrease caused by PEG in IAA, ethylene, ABA, and BR contents and the increase caused by PEG in GA3 and KT contents. Collectively, Tre appears to be the effective treatment in counteracting the negative effects of drought stress during adventitious root formation by regulating ROS, Tre metabolisms and plant hormones.",

OBJECTIVES: Here, we explored the effectiveness of nutritional trehalose supplementation in ameliorating symptoms in a mouse model of Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), an incurable late onset manifestation of moderately expanded trinucleotide CGG repeat expansion mutations in the 5' untranslated region of the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 gene (FMR1). METHODS: An inducible mouse model of FXTAS expressing 90 CGG repeats in the brain had been previously developed, which faithfully captures hallmarks of the disorder, the formation of intracellular inclusions, and the disturbance of motor function. Taking advantage of the inducible nature of the model, we investigated the therapeutic potential of orally administered trehalose under two regimens, modelling disease prevention and disease treatment. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Trehalose's effectiveness in combating protein aggregation is frequently attributed to its ability to induce autophagy. Accordingly, trehalose supplementation under the prevention regimen ameliorated the formation of intranuclear inclusions and improved the motor deficiencies resulting from the induced expression of 90 CGG repeats, but it failed to reverse the existing nuclear pathology as a treatment strategy. Given the favorable safety profile of trehalose, it is promising to further explore the potential of this agent for early stage FXTAS.",

Over the past 60 years, DENV has spread throughout tropical regions and currently affects more than 50% of the world's population; however, there are as of yet no effective anti-DENV drugs for clinical treatment. A number of research teams have investigated derivatives of glycolipids as possible agents for the inhibition of DENV. Our objective in this research was to study the antiviral effects of trehalose 6-caprate (TMC), trehalose 6-monolaurate (TML), and trehalose 6-monooleate (TMO), based on reports that the corresponding glycosyl, trehalose, reduces the transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV). We also sought to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying inhibition using the RNA isolation and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blot analysis, median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50 ) assay, and immunofluorescence assay and immunochemistry staining, in vitro. This is the first study to demonstrate the TML-induced inhibition of DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory effects of TML in the pretreated, cotreated, and full-treated groups were confirmed using time of addition assays. We determined that TML restricted viral binding, entry, replication, and release. We also confirmed the efficacy of TML against three clinical isolates of DENV serotypes 1, 3, and 4 (DENV-1, DENV-3, and DENV-4). The findings obtained in this study identify TML as a promising candidate for the development of drugs to treat DENV infection.",

In this study, our aim was to elucidate the metabolic mechanisms underlying the protective effects of trehalose against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress in C2C12 myoblasts. Our results show that both trehalose treatment and pretreatment effectively alleviate the H2O2-induced decrease in cell viability, reduce intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and attenuate lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, using NMR-based metabolomics analysis, we observed that trehalose treatment and pretreatment modulate the metabolic profile of myoblasts, specifically regulating oxidant metabolism and amino acid metabolism, contributing to their protective effects against oxidative stress. Importantly, our results reveal that trehalose treatment and pretreatment upregulate the expression levels of P62 and Nrf2 proteins, thereby activating the Nrf2-NQO1 axis and effectively reducing oxidative stress. These significant findings highlight the potential of trehalose supplementation as a promising and effective strategy for alleviating oxidative stress in skeletal muscle and provide valuable insights into its potential therapeutic applications.",

Trehalase is a key enzyme in insect trehalose metabolism and plays an important role in the growth and development of insects. However, the specific function of trehalase in parasitoid and host associations has been less reported. In this study, we obtained two trehalase genes (SlTre1 and SlTre2) from our previously constructed S. litura transcriptome database; they were highly expressed in 3rd instar larvae. SlTre1 was mainly expressed in the midgut, and SlTre2 was expressed highest in the head. SlTre1 and SlTre2 were highly expressed 5 days after parasitization by M. pulchricornis. Treatment with the trehalase inhibitor validamycin A significantly inhibited the expression levels of SlTre1 and SlTre2, and the trehalase activity. Besides, the content of trehalose was increased but the content of glucose was decreased 24 h after validamycin A treatment in parasitized S. litura larvae. In addition, the immune-related genes in phenoloxidase (PO) pathway and fatty acid synthesis-related genes in lipid metabolism were upregulated in parasitized host larvae after validamycin A treatment. Importantly, the emergence rate, proportion of normal adults, and body size of parasitoid offspring was decreased in parasitized S. litura larvae after validamycin A treatment, indicating that validamycin A disrupts the trehalose metabolism of parasitized host and thus reduces the fitness of parasitoid offspring. The present study provides a novel perspective for coordinating the application of biocontrol and antibiotics in agroecosystem.",

METHODS: Arthritis was induced via subcutaneous injection of CFA (0.1) into the right footpad of each rat. Trehalose (10 mg/kg per day) and indomethacin (5 mg/kg) as a reference drug were intraperitoneally injected into CFA-induced arthritic rats from days 0 to 21. Changes in paw volume, pain responses, arthritic score, and oxidative/antioxidative parameters were determined. RESULTS: Trehalose administration could significantly decrease arthritis scores (p <0.01) and paw edema (p <0.001), and significantly increase the nociceptive threshold (p <0.05) in CFA-induced arthritic rats. Trehalose also significantly reduced the pro-oxidant-antioxidant balance values when compared to CFA treatment alone. In addition, no significant difference was found between the trehalose group and indomethacin as a positive control group. CONCLUSION: The current study suggests that trehalose has a protective effect against arthritis, which may be mediated by antioxidative effects of this disaccharide.",

Trehalose, a natural disaccharide, has been identified to reduce dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and glucose intolerance. However, the roles of trehalose on lipid metabolism in aged liver are unclear which was investigated in this study. Thirty-two male Wistar rats were randomly allocated into four groups (n = 8). Two groups of aged (24 months) and young (4 months) rats were administered 2% trehalose solution orally for 30 days. Control groups of aged and young rats did not receive any treatment. At the end of the treatment period, blood samples and liver tissues were collected. Then the expression of SIRT1, AMPK, SREBP-1c, and PPAR-α and the level of AMPK phosphorylation (p-AMPK) were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Moreover, biochemical parameters and the histopathology of livers were evaluated. Trehalose supplementation increased the level of SIRT1, p-AMPK, and PPAR-α, whereas the level of SREBP-1c was diminished in the liver of old animals. In addition, treatment with trehalose improved histopathological features of senescent livers. Taken together, our results show that old rats developed lipogenesis in the liver which was alleviated with trehalose. Therefore, trehalose may be an effective intervention to reduce the progression of aging-induced liver diseases.",

Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) is a crucial cellular survival protein, which its gene has been identified as a direct target of microRNA 132 (miR-132). Trehalose contributes to preventing neuronal damage through several mechanisms. However, little is known about the interactive effects of aging and trehalose on the expression pattern of miR-132 and SIRT1 in the hippocampus. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups. Two groups of aged (24 months) and young (4 months) rats were administered 2% trehalose solution for 30 days. Two other groups of aged and young rats received regular tap water. At the end of treatment, the levels of Sirt1 mRNA and its protein, malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl content, total antioxidant capacity, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), as well as the expression of miR-132 were measured in the hippocampus. We found that trehalose treatment upregulated the expression of SIRT1 and miR-132. Moreover, administration of trehalose enhanced the level of total antioxidant activity whereas reduced the levels of lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyl content, and TNF-α. In conclusion, our data indicated that trehalose restored antioxidant status and alleviated inflammation in the hippocampus which was probably associated with the upregulation of SIRT1 and miR-132.",

In this backdrop, experiments were conducted to evaluate the influence of exogenous supplementation of trehalose (500 µM Treh) and spermidine (500 µM Spd) in alleviating the damaging effects of zinc toxicity (100 µM ZnSO4) in Vigna radiata. Growth, chlorophyll and photosynthesis were reduced due to Zn toxicity; however, exogenous supplementation of trehalose and spermidine not only increased the parameters but also alleviated the decline to considerable levels. Toxicity of zinc increased H2O2, lipid peroxidation and electrolyte leakage by 100.43%, 84.53% and 134.64%, respectively, and application of trehalose and spermidine a reduction of 29.32%, 39.09% and 44.91%, respectively, over the zinc-treated plants. Application of trehalose and spermidine increased the activity of nitrate reductase and the content of nitrogen concomitant with alleviation of the decline caused due to zinc toxicity. The activity of antioxidant system enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase and the enzymes of ascorbate-glutathione cycle was significantly enhanced due to trehalose and spermidine application. Proline, glycine betaine and activity of γ-glutamyl kinase increased maximally by 281.84%, 126.21% and 181.08%, respectively, in plants treated with zinc + trehalose + spermidine over control. Significant enhancement in the content of total phenols and flavonoids was observed due to the treatment of trehalose and spermidine individually as well as combinedly. Application of trehalose and spermidine reduced the content of methylglyoxal by up-regulating the activity of glyoxylase cycle enzymes. In addition under zinc toxicity conditions, the content of zinc declined in trehalose- and spermidine-treated plants."

      "abstract": "High-temperature stress limits plant growth and reproduction. Exposure to high temperature, however, also elicits a physiological response, which protects plants from the damage evoked by heat. This response involves a partial reconfiguration of the metabolome including the accumulation of the trisaccharide raffinose. In this study, we explored the intraspecific variation of warm temperature-induced raffinose accumulation as a metabolic marker for temperature responsiveness with the aim to identify genes that contribute to thermotolerance. By combining raffinose measurements in 250 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions following a mild heat treatment with genome-wide association studies, we identified five genomic regions that were associated with the observed trait variation. Subsequent functional analyses confirmed a causal relationship between TREHALOSE-6-PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE 1 (TPS1) and warm temperature-dependent raffinose synthesis. Moreover, complementation of the tps1-1 null mutant with functionally distinct TPS1 isoforms differentially affected carbohydrate metabolism under more severe heat stress. While higher TPS1 activity was associated with reduced endogenous sucrose levels and thermotolerance, disruption of trehalose 6-phosphate signalling resulted in higher accumulation of transitory starch and sucrose and was associated with enhanced heat resistance. Taken together, our findings suggest a role of trehalose 6-phosphate in thermotolerance, most likely through its regulatory function in carbon partitioning and sucrose homoeostasis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Trehalose is a non-reducing disaccharide synthesized by lower organisms. It has recently received special attention because of its neuroprotective properties by stimulating autophagy in Parkinson's disease (PD) models. Therefore, evaluating whether trehalose affects metabolic organs is vital to determine its neurotherapeutic safety. METHODS: We validated the trehalose neuroprotective dosage in a PD model induced with intraperitoneal paraquat administration twice weekly for 7 weeks. One week before paraquat administration, mice were treated with trehalose in the drinking water and continued along with paraquat treatment. Histological and morphometrical analyses were conducted on the organs involved in trehalose metabolism, including the liver, pancreas, and kidney. RESULTS: Paraquat-induced dopaminergic neuronal loss was significantly decreased by trehalose. After trehalose treatment, the liver morphology, the mononucleated/binucleated hepatocytes percentage, and sinusoidal diameter remained unchanged in each liver lobes. Endocrine and exocrine pancreas's histology was not affected, nor was any fibrotic process observed. The islet of Langerhans's structure was preserved when analyzing the area, the largest and smallest diameter, and circularity. Renal morphology remained undamaged, and no changes were identified within the glomerular basement membrane. The renal corpuscle structure did not suffer alterations in the Bowman's space, area, diameter, circularity, perimeter, and cellularity. Besides, the renal tubular structures's luminal area and internal and external diameter were preserved. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that systemic trehalose administration preserved the typical histological architecture of the organs involved in its metabolism, supporting its safety as a potential neuroprotective agent.",

      "abstract": "Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a pathological damage secondary to myocardial ischemia that can further aggravate tissue and organ injuries. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop an effective approach for alleviating myocardial I/R injury. Trehalose (TRE) is a natural bioactive substance that has been shown to have extensive physiological effects in various animals and plants. However, TRE's protective effects against myocardial I/R injury remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of TRE pre-treatment in mice with acute myocardial I/R injury and to explore the role of pyroptosis in this process. Mice were pre-treated with trehalose (1 mg/g) or an equivalent amount of saline solution for 7 days. The left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated in mice from the I/R and I/R + TRE groups, followed by 2-h or 24-h reperfusion after 30 min. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed to assess cardiac function in mice. Serum and cardiac tissue samples were obtained to examine the relevant indicators. We established an oxygen-glucose deprivation and re-oxygenation model in neonatal mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes and validated the mechanism by which trehalose affects myocardial necrosis via overexpression or silencing of NLRP3. TRE pre-treatment significantly improved cardiac dysfunction and reduced the infarct size in mice after I/R, accompanied by a decrease in the I/R-induced levels of CK-MB, cTnT, LDH, reactive oxygen species, pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18, and TUNEL-positive cells. Furthermore, TRE intervention suppressed the expression of pyroptosis-related proteins following I/R. TRE attenuates myocardial I/R injury in mice by inhibiting NLRP3-mediated caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis in cardiomyocytes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pharmaceutical excipients are an important part of biological products. However, few attempts have been made to distinguish between the risk of inflammation associated with the biological products themselves and that associated with excipients. The analysis of early immune response risk associated with excipients added to biological products is an important step in exploring the complex mechanism of side effects in susceptible patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, nanoparticle impurities (NPIs) were extracted from trehalose and characterized. A mouse popliteal lymph node cell (PLNA) model, a mouse spleen lymphocyte model, a human peripheral blood mononuclear cell cytokine release model, and a macrophage complement activation model were established to comprehensively evaluate the early immune risk related to impurities in the trehalose excipient. Although popliteal lymph node cell counts in mice did not show significant differences, all other models indicated possible immune risk. In the PLNA model, NPIs caused significant toe thickening in mice, whereby the content of IgE and MCP-1 increased significantly. NPIs significantly increased the proliferation and differentiation of spleen lymphocytes according to the CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry. After treatment with NPIs, the release of IgE and a variety of cytokines (MIP-1α, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-8, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1α) in human peripheral blood cells was significantly increased according to ELISA, while a concomitant increase of C3a/C5a as well as C4a/Bb proved that NPIs activated the complement system. CONCLUSION: NPIs from trehalose elicited an immune response in vitro, and the immune response to trehalose may be related to NPIs and not the excipient itself. Different batches of trehalose showed different immune response effects. The currents research suggests that when trehalose is applied in high-risk administration routes, NPIs should be assessed and reasonably controlled.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To probe the effect of trehalose on myocardial hypertrophy and its specific molecular mechanism. METHODS: C57BL/6J male mice were divided into four subgroups: Sham operation subgroup (Sham), negative sham subgroup (Sham+Trehalose), transverse aortic constriction (TAC), and trehalose treatment subgroup (TAC+Trehalose). Immediately after the TAC operation, trehalose at a dose of 10 mg/kg was given daily via gavage. After four weeks, changes in cardiac function were evaluated using ultrasound to measure EF (ejection fraction), FS (fractional shortening), IVRT (isovolumic relaxation time), MPI (myocardial performance index), Tau (isovolumic relaxation time constant), LVESP (left ventricular end-systolic pressure), and EDPVR (end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship). The profiles of autophagy-associated proteins (p62, LC3II/I, and Beclin-1) and GATA4 protein in mice myocardial tissues were assessed by Western blotting (WB). Myocardial cells were classified from TAC mice into five groups: Control, Trehalose, Phenylephrine (PE), PE+Trehalose, and PE+Trehalose+autophagy inhibitor chloroquine groups. In the PE group, cardiomyocytes were treated with 50 μmol/L PE. Then, the cells were treated with trehalose (100 μmol/L), trehalose (100 μmol/L)+autophagy (20 μmol/L) for 24 hours respectively. The Control group was treated with the same amount of normal saline. Flow cytometry was utilized to detect myocardial cell apoptosis in each subgroup. The alterations in apoptosis and autophagy-correlated proteins (p62, LC3II/I, and Beclin-1) were assessed by WB. Additionally, the level of GATA4 protein upstream of autophagy was estimated. Furthermore, the expression levels of pro-apoptotic proteins Bad, BAX, Cleaved-caspase-3, and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 were examined by WB. RESULTS: The TAC operation significantly augmented myocardial hypertrophy, heart weight-to-body weight ratio, and myocardial cell apoptosis in mice (p < 0.05). Trehalose significantly improved cardiac hypertrophy, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and cardiac function decline in mice. Additionally, it also significantly enhanced autophagy in mouse cardiac tissues (p < 0.05). At the cellular level, trehalose significantly decreased PE-elicited apoptosis and promoted the protein expressions of Beclin-1 and LC3 II/I in cardiomyocytes while significantly dampening the profiles of p62 and GATA4 in cells. The effect of trehalose and chloroquine treatment was significantly greater than that of the trehalose group. CONCLUSIONS: Trehalose significantly abates myocardial hypertrophy and pressure overload-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis in mice. The cardioprotective effect of trehalose on enhanced autophagy is attributed, at least in part, to the promotion of autophagic degradation of GATA4.",

      "abstract": "An improved vaccine is urgently needed to replace the now more than 100-year-old Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine against tuberculosis (TB) disease, which represents a significant burden on global public health. Mycolic acid, or cord factor trehalose 6,6' dimycolate (TDM), a lipid component abundant in the cell wall of the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), has been shown to have strong immunostimulatory activity but remains underexplored due to its high toxicity and poor solubility. Herein, we employed a novel strategy to encapsulate TDM within a cubosome lipid nanocarrier as a potential subunit nanovaccine candidate against TB. This strategy not only increased the solubility and reduced the toxicity of TDM but also elicited a protective immune response to control MTB growth in macrophages. Both pre-treatment and concurrent treatment of the TDM encapsulated in lipid monoolein (MO) cubosomes (MO-TDM) (1 mol %) induced a strong proinflammatory cytokine response in MTB-infected macrophages, due to epigenetic changes at the promoters of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in comparison to the untreated control. Furthermore, treatment with MO-TDM (1 mol %) cubosomes significantly improved antigen processing and presentation capabilities of MTB-infected macrophages to CD4 T cells. The ability of MO-TDM (1 mol %) cubosomes to induce a robust innate and adaptive response in vitro was further supported by a mathematical modeling study predicting the vaccine efficacy in vivo. Overall, these results indicate a strong immunostimulatory effect of TDM when delivered through the lipid nanocarrier, suggesting its potential as a novel TB vaccine.",

To determine the mechanism of Serendipita indica and Tre-mediated cold stress tolerance, a comparative experiment was designed to study the impact of S. indica, Tre and their combination on tomato plants grown under cold stress. The results showed that cold stress significantly decreased biomass, relative water content, photosynthetic pigments and elements concomitantly with increasing antioxidant activities, malondialdehyde (MDA), electrolyte leakage, hydrogen peroxide and proline content. Meanwhile, S. indica and Tre treatments promoted biomass and enhanced carbohydrate, protein, proline, potassium, phosphorous, antioxidant enzymes and photosynthetic pigments content under cold stress. Furthermore, single or dual application of endophyte and Tre mitigated physiological disorders induced by cold stress and increased the integrity of cell membranes by decreasing hydrogen peroxide, MDA, and electrolyte leakage (EL). Our findings suggest that S. indica and Tre combination could significantly promote cold stress tolerance compared with single treatment. This study is novel in showing the cold adaptation of tomato plants by combination use of S. indica and Tre, which can be a promising strategy for improving cold tolerance. The underlying molecular mechanisms of sugar-fungus interaction must be further investigated.",

METHODS: Prior to RCT, the effect of trehalose (5-20%) on the epithelial growth of fetal mouse salivary gland (SG) explants was evaluated to confirm if 10% trehalose exerted the best epithelial outcomes. Participants who completed radiotherapy for head and neck cancer (HNC) treatment were enrolled in a double-blind RCT, according to inclusion and exclusion criteria as per the CONSORT statement. The experimental group (n = 35) received 10% trehalose spray, while the control group (n = 35) received carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) spray to apply intra-orally 4 times/day for 14 days. Salivary pH and unstimulated salivary flow rate were recorded pre- and post-interventions. The Xerostomia-related Quality of Life scale (XeQoLs) was filled, and scores assessed post-interventions. RESULTS: In the SG explant model, pro-acinar epithelial growth and mitosis was supported by 10% topical trehalose. As for RCT outcomes, salivary pH and unstimulated salivary flow rate were significantly improved after use of 10% trehalose spray when compared to CMC (p < 0.05). Participants reported an improvement of XeQoLs dimension scores after using trehalose or CMC oral sprays in terms of physical, pain/discomfort, and psychological dimensions (p < 0.05), but not social (p > 0.05). When comparing between CMC and trehalose sprays, XeQoLs total scores were not statistically different (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The 10% trehalose spray improved salivary pH, unstimulated salivary flow rate, and the quality-of-life dimensions linked with physical, pain/discomfort, and psychological signs. The clinical efficacy of 10% trehalose spray was equivalent with CMC-based saliva substitutes for relieving radiation-induced xerostomia; therefore, trehalose may be suggested in alternative to CMC-based oral spray.(Thai Clinical Trials Registry; https://www.thaiclinicaltrials.org/ TCTR20190817004).",

      "abstract": "α,α'-Trehalose 6,6'-glycolipids have long been known for their immunostimulatory properties. The adjuvanticity of α,α'-trehalose 6,6'-glycolipids is mediated by signalling through the macrophage inducible C-type lectin (Mincle) and the induction of an inflammatory response. Herein, we present an aryl-functionalised trehalose glycolipid, AF-2, that leads to the release of cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, MIP-2 and TNF-α, in a Mincle-dependent manner. Furthermore, plate-coated AF-2 also leads to the Mincle-independent production of IL-1β, which is unprecedented for this class of glycolipid. Upon investigation into the mode of action of plate-coated AF-2, it was observed that the treatment of WT and Mincle-/- bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM), murine RAW264.7 cells, and human monocytes with AF-2 led to lytic cell death, as evidenced using Sytox Green and lactate dehydrogenase assays, and confocal and scanning electron microscopy. The requirement for functional Gasdermin D and Caspase-1 for IL-1β production and cell death by AF-2 confirmed pyroptosis as the mode of action of AF-2. The inhibition of NLRP3 and K+ efflux reduced AF-2 mediated IL-1β production and cell death, and allowed us to conclude that AF-2 leads to Capase-1 dependent NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated cell death. The unique mode of action of plate-coated AF-2 was surprising and highlights how the physical presentation of Mincle ligands can lead to dramatically different immunological outcomes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Dry eye disease (DED) is common in postmenopausal women. This study evaluated efficacy of a 3-month daily treatment with artificial tears containing trehalose and hyaluronic acid (HA) in women aged 42-54 years (mixed-hormonal status) versus ≥ 55 years (postmenopausal) and with moderate and severe DED. METHODS: This was a post-hoc analysis of three clinical trials assessing the efficacy of artificial tears containing trehalose (3%) and HA (0.15%) in women with an Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) ≥ 18. Patients instilled one drop of the artificial tears in each eye 3 to 6 times daily and were evaluated at baseline and after 84 ± 7 days for DED symptom severity (OSDI), hyperemia (McMonnies scale), tear break-up time (TBUT), corneal and conjunctival staining (Oxford and Van Bjisterveld scales), tear production (Schirmer I test), and ocular symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 273 women were evaluated, 61 of age 42-54 years; 212 of ≥ 55 years. DED symptoms, as measured by the OSDI, decreased significantly with the treatment in both age groups (p < 0.0001). Conjunctival hyperemia decreased significantly and TBUT increased significantly in both groups, especially in women of age 42-54 (both p < 0.0001). The global (corneal and conjunctival) staining score decreased significantly in both groups, but also more in women of age 42-54 years. No differences were observed between age groups for any of the variables measured, except for visual acuity. DED symptoms were consistently reported more frequently by the mixed hormonal status women, but also the effect of the treatment was more pronounced in this group. CONCLUSIONS: Artificial tears with trehalose and HA significantly improved the symptoms of DED in women aged 42-54 and ≥ 55 years. The decrease in symptoms was more pronounced in women of age 42-54 years, suggesting better mechanisms of recovery from inflammation and loss of ocular surface homeostasis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Trehalose is a naturally occurring disaccharide, which has been identified as an autophagy inducer and exhibits protective effect in cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infraction and atherosclerosis. However, the functional role of trehalose in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) remains undefined. METHODS: To study the effect of trehalose in AAA, trehalose (1 g/kg per day) were given for 14 continuous days in a mouse model of elastase-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm. On day 14, ultrasound was performed to measure aortic diameter before the abdominal aortas were harvested and processed for further analysis. Verhoeff-Van Gieson staining and TUNEL staining were performed on paraffin sections to evaluate vascular histology and apoptosis, immunofluorescence staining and Western-blot were performed to evaluate expression of autophagy markers. RESULTS: Echocardiography and in situ pictures demonstrated that trehalose attenuated infrarenal aorta dilation. Verhoeff-Van Gieson staining showed elastin degradation was improved in trehalose-treated group. Compared with vehicle-treated mice, trehalose treatment restored smooth muscle cell contractile phenotype with increased α-SMA, Calponin and Myh11 expression. Furthermore, trehalose also attenuated cell apoptosis and leukocytes infiltration. Importantly, trehalose induced autophagy with decrease SQSTM1/p62 accumulation, increased lamp2 expression and LC3B conversion. CONCLUSION: Trehalose attenuated AAA progression with decreased inflammation and restored SMC contractile phenotype by inducing autophagy. These results demonstrated the therapeutic potential of trehalose in AAA."
