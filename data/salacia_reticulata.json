      "abstract": "Background Traditional physicians in Sri Lanka and India use extracts from the plant Salacia reticulata,or Kothala Himbutu (KH) to treat diabetes. The effect of a KH biscuit, taken as a snack, on glycemic control was investigated in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methodology This triple-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-period, two-sequence, crossover study was conducted in the Internal Medical Clinic, Teaching Hospital Anuradhapura. A research assistant opened computer-generated random numbers enclosed in a sealed envelope and performed treatment allocation. The group outcome was masked from the researchers, patients, and analysts. Both the placebo and the KH biscuit were identical. The primary outcome measure was HbA1c. Intention to treat analyses was used. Glycemic stability was assured in the run-in period, and patients with severe renal, liver, or heart disease were excluded. If patients needed insulin, they were withdrawn from the trial. Results From January 2014 to May 2016, 230 patients were screened, and 136 were randomized. Of them, 62 were allocated, 58 completed the placebo biscuit, 71 were allocated, and 69 completed the KH biscuit. After the washout period and crossover, 57 completed the KH and 65 completed the placebo biscuit. The baseline mean HbA1c level was 8.45% (68.9 mmol/mol) and 8.65% (71.0 mmol/mol) for the placebo-KH biscuit and KH-placebo biscuit groups. At the end of the trial, the HbA1c levels in the placebo-KH biscuit group and the KH-placebo biscuit group were 8.23% (66.4 mmol/mol) and 8.53% (69.3 mmol/mol), respectively. The unadjusted mean HbA1c reduced from the baseline with 0.10% (95% CI = -0.12, 0.32) after the placebo biscuit and 0.35% (95% CI = 0.10, 0.60) after the KH biscuit. After the placebo and KH biscuits, the HbA1c values were 8.46% (95% CI = 8.19, 8.73) (69 mmol/mol with 95% CI = 66, 72) and 8.19% (95% CI = 7.90, 8.48) (66 mmol/mol with 95% CI = 63, 69), respectively. The paired sample t-test shows that the reduction was not significant for placebo biscuits (p = 0.324), while it is significant for KH biscuits (p = 0.003). Analysis with multiple imputations confirmed a significant difference between the placebo and KH biscuit in reducing the HbA1c level. Conclusions KH biscuit taken as a snack reduces HbA1c by 0.25% compared to placebo without serious renal or liver adverse effects. The biscuit can be safely recommended as a snack to patients with type 2 diabetes."

      "abstract": "The excessive storage of triglycerides in adipose tissue is a characteristic feature of obesity, which arises from an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure. In this study, we aimed to explore the potential anti-obesity effects of Salacia reticulata extracts (SC) in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced in obese mice and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, with a specific focus on understanding the underlying lipid mechanisms. Mice were fed with a normal diet (NC; normal control), HFD (60% high-fat diet), Met (HFD containing metformin 250 mg/kg b.w.), SC25 (HFD containing SC 25 mg/kg b.w.), SC50 (HFD containing SC 50 mg/kg b.w.), or SC 100 (HFD containing SC 100 mg/kg b.w.) for 12 weeks. Notably, SC supplementation led to significant reductions in body weight gain, adipose tissue weight, adipose tissue mass, and adipocyte size in HFD-fed mice. Furthermore, SC supplementation exerted inhibitory effects on the adipogenesis and lipogenesis pathways while promoting lipolysis and thermogenesis pathways in the adipose tissues of HFD-fed mice. In vitro experiments using 3T3-L1 cells demonstrated that SC treatment during the differentiation phase suppressed adipogenesis and lipogenesis, whereas SC treatment after differentiation, activated lipolysis and thermogenesis. Collectively, these findings indicate that SC exhibits a direct influence on the lipid metabolism of adipocytes, making it an effective candidate for weight loss interventions."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The present study investigated the effects of Salacia reticulata and simvastatin on oxidative stress and insulin resistance in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. We compared the protective effect of a methanolic extract of Salacia reticulata (SR) with simvastatin (SVS) in rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD). METHODS AND RESULTS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into the following five different groups: control (C), C+SR, HFD, HFD+SR, and HFD+SVS. High-fat diet fed rats showed hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, hyperleptinemia, dyslipidemia, and hypoadiponectinemia after 90 days. Treatment of high-fat diet fed rats with SR/SVS significantly (p < 0.05) reduced high-fat diet induced increases in plasma triglycerides, total cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and decreased high- density lipoprotein (HDL) accompanied by an increase in lipid peroxidation (LPO) and protein oxidation. In addition, a significant decrease in the activities of antioxidant enzymes and enzymes of the polyol pathway was observed in rats fed high-fat diet. SR was found to be more effective than SVS. Moreover, infiltration of inflammatory cells and fibrosis in the liver of high-fat diet fed rats by SR/SVS were also prevented. CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirms that SR/SVS may be a new and promising remedial approach because of its beneficial effects on the pathophysiological processes of obesity and related metabolic disorders.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) of juvenile onset affects both the peripheral and central nervous systems (CNS). However, central effects are less documented and studied than peripheral deficits. Currently, the only feasible treatment available for type 1 DM (T1DM) is insulin which has its own limitations. Hence, an alternative therapy, especially a newer herbal formulation is very much the need of the time. The present study aimed to determine the effects of the alcoholic extracts of roots of the Salacia reticulata W. (SR) and Clitoria ternatea L. (CT) on cognitive and behavioral changes in juvenile diabetic rats. METHODS: Diabetes was induced in 25-day-old Wistar rats by streptozotocin (50 mg/kg bw, IP). Animals were divided into seven groups (n=6). Rats were treated with root extracts of SR and CT (100 mg/kg BW each) for 30 days, from day 1 and day 20 of diabetes confirmation. Then, rats were tested in elevated plus maze (EPM) and Morris water maze (MWM). RESULTS: A statistically significant (p<0.05) difference was observed between the SRCT group and diabetic groups of rats. Apart from decreasing FBS, the combined therapy also proved beneficial as nootropic agent in rats with early-onset diabetes. However, significant improvement is observed only in the learning and memory among preventive group, but not in the curative group. CONCLUSIONS: SRCT, a herbal formula, when used in combination, has a more potent effect in preventing the deleterious effects of juvenile diabetes on cognitive and behavioral changes.",

      "abstract": "Extracts of Salacia reticulata Wight (Hypocrataceae) roots, stems, and leaves have been used in Asia for hundreds of years for the folkloric treatment of diabetes and other health problems. Constituents that have been identified as exhibiting anti-diabetic effects include salacinol, kotalanol, ponkorinol, salaprinol, and their corresponding de-0-sulfonated compounds. Mangiferin, kotalagenin 16-acetate and various proanthocyanidin oligomers have also been isolated. Studies indicate that Salacia extracts modulate multiple targets that influence carbohydrate and lipid metabolism including α-glucosidase, aldose reductase, pancreatic lipase, peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-α, glucose transporter-4 mediated glucose uptake, and angiotensin II type 1 receptor. Furthermore, Salacia extracts exhibit free radical scavenging, antioxidant and hepatoprotectant activities. In human studies, Salacia extracts have been shown to decrease plasma glucose and insulin levels, decrease HbA1c, and modulate serum lipid levels with no adverse effects being reported. Similar results have been demonstrated in rat and mouse models as well as in vitro systems. Safety of S. reticulata and other Salacia species as S. oblonga and S. chinensis in rats and mice indicate that extracts are exceedingly safe. No clinical studies have examined the effects of Salacia extracts on human weight loss, although weight loss and decreases in weight gain have been demonstrated in animal models. Because of the large number of pharmacologically active compounds, it is difficult to establish standards for extracts.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nearly 50% of diabetic patients worldwide use complementary medicines to treat or supplement their conventional diabetes treatment. Salacia reticulata (Kothala himbutu) is a woody climber used widely in the Ayurvedic system to treat diabetes and obesity. OBJECTIVE: In this review I critically analyze the evidence for using Salacia reticulata for treating type 2 diabetes and obesity. The available evidence is described in terms of in-vitro studies, animal studies and clinical trials. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: In vitro studies demonstrate the ability of Salacia to inhibit intestinal alpha glucosidase. In mouse mesenteric fat it enhances the mRNA expression for hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) and adiponectin; thus increasing lipolysis and reducing insulin resistance respectively. In 3 T3-L-1 adipocytes lipogenesis factors are down regulated and lipolysis factors are up regulated with Salacia reticulata treatment. Animal studies and clinical trials are consistent in demonstrating improvement of glucose concentrations in the fasted and sucrose and maltose loaded states. Clinically significant reductions of HbA1C and plasma Insulin are reported with treatment of 6 weeks to 3 months. One clinical trial reported significant reduction of weight and BMI when Salacia is used in combination with vitamin D. Salacia reticulata effectively improves insulin resistance, glucose metabolism and reduces obesity. A larger evidence base is required from well-planned studies to confirm its efficacy and safety.",

Cells treated with non-toxic doses of S. reticulata root extract were investigated for their effects on melanogenesis, cellular tyrosinase activity and cellular oxidant scavenging activity. The results indicated that S. reticulata extract inhibited melanin synthesis and tyrosinase activity in alpha-MSH-induced or UV-irradiated B16 melanoma cells in a dose dependent manner. Additionally, the extract also exhibited anti-cellular oxidants in UV-induced radical melanoma cells. Altogether, these results suggested that S. reticulata root extract has roles in suppression of melanogenesis and oxidant inhibition.

      "abstract": "Salacia reticulata Wight (S. reticulata) is a herbal medicine used for treatment of early diabetes in Ayurvedic medicine. In previous reports, the extract of S. reticulata showed preventive effects on obesity and various metabolic disorders and a suppressive effect on differentiation in premature adipocytes. The aim of this research was to elucidate the therapeutic efficacy of the extract of S. reticulata on obesity and various metabolic disorders in 12-week-old TSOD mice with obesity and metabolic disorders and in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In TSOD mice, S. reticulata therapy produced a reduction in body weight and mesenteric fat accumulation, an improvement in abnormal glucose metabolism, and an increase in adiponectin level in plasma. In addition, the mRNA expressions of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and adiponectin were increased in mesenteric fat. In in vitro experiments, S. reticulata therapy produced suppression of intracellular triacylglycerol accumulation and enhancement of glycerol release into the medium in mature 3T3-L1 cells. The mRNA expressions of lipogenesis factor (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, lipoprotein lipase, CD36, and fatty acid binding protein 4) were down-regulated, while the expressions of lipolysis factor (adipose tissue triacylglycerol lipase and HSL) and adiponectin were up-regulated. Moreover, the extract of S. reticulata enhanced the expression of total AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα) and phosphorylated AMPKα in mature adipocytes. These findings demonstrate that the extract of S. reticulata has therapeutic effects on obesity and metabolic disorders by enhancing lipogenesis genes and suppressing lipolysis genes through the activation of AMPKα in adipocytes.",

MATERIAL: In a randomized open-label study, we investigated 40 healthy participants aged 30 - 60 years, physically active, with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 - 45. The participants were randomly allocated into two groups. Body weight, BMI, and body composition were measured. Both groups (A and B) received a guideline for lifestyle and fitness training for 4 weeks. Group B additionally took one capsule containing 200 mg of Salacia reticulata and 1.6 µg (i. e. 64 IU) Vitamin D₃ (SRD) 3 times/day with the meals. RESULTS: Significant weight and body-fat reduction within 4 weeks was observed. Group A lost 1.8 kg or 2.1 %, group B lost 5.3 kg or 6.1 % (p = 0.03), therefore BMI reduction was achieved. While Group A lost 1.4 % of body fat, group B reduced it by 4.5 % (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: These promising results suggest that the combination of Salacia reticulata and Vitamin D₃ might be highly valuable and potent to treat overweight and obesity, especially in addition to a modifying lifestyle program. Further research is needed in addition to this study to clarify pathways and effect mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Salacia reticulata (SR) is a plant native to Sri Lanka. In ayurvedic medicine, SR bark preparations, taken orally, are considered effective in the treatment of rheumatism and diabetes. We investigated the ability of SR leaves (SRL) to inhibit in vitro the interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-activated proliferation of synoviocyte-like cells derived from rheumatoid arthritis model mice. FINDINGS: Inflammatory synovial tissues were harvested from type II collagen antibody-induced arthritic mice. From these tissues, a synoviocyte-like cell line was established and named MTS-C H7. To determine whether SRL can suppress cell proliferation and gene expression in MTS-C H7 cells, fractionation of the SRL hot-water extract was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), liquid-liquid extraction, sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and protease digestion.The 50% inhibitory concentration of the SRL hot-water extract against MTS-C H7 cells proliferation was ~850 μg/mL. Treatment with a low dose (25 μg dry matter per millilitre) of the extract inhibited IL-1β-induced cell proliferation and suppressed the expression of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) genes in MTS-C H7 cells. Various polyphenolic fractions obtained from HPLC and the fractions from liquid-liquid extraction did not affect cell proliferation. Only the residual water sample from liquid-liquid extraction significantly affected cell proliferation and the expression of MMP genes. The results of SDS-PAGE and protease digestion experiment showed that low molecular weight proteins present in SRL inhibited the IL-1β-activated cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: We surmised that the residual water fraction of the SRL extract was involved in the inhibition of IL-1β-activated cell proliferation and regulation of mRNA expression in MTS-C H7 cells. In addition, we believe that the active ingredients in the extract are low molecular weight proteins.",

AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was performed to elucidate the mechanism of action of Salacia reticulata with special attention to the adipocytes as the tissue primarily involved in the pathology of metabolic diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mouse-derived adipocyte precursor 3T3-L1 cells were treated with differentiation inducers in the presence or absence of Salacia reticulata (SRCD). We determined triacylglycerol accumulations, differentiation makers, released glycerol and adiponectin. Mangiferin, the primary component of SRCD, was also treated to 3T3-L1 cells. RESULT: Concurrent administration of the extract of SRCD and differentiation inducers resulted in a significant inhibition of differentiation into mature adipocytes. SRCD also exhibited significant inhibitory action on the expression of genes and proteins of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ and CCAAT-enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)α, as well as on the activity of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH), a differentiation marker, and caused a reduction in the concentration of released adiponectin. However, SRCD had no influence on lipolysis as indicated by the release of glycerol into the culture medium. The primary component of SRCD, mangiferin, was investigated for its effect on adipocytes; mangiferin caused no suppression of fat accumulation, suggesting that a component of SRCD other than mangiferin may be involved in the inhibition of adipocyte differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: The above results suggest that the inhibitory action of SRCD on adipocyte differentiation, and not the promotion of lipolysis, is involved in the suppression of fat accumulation.",

The method sufficiently resolved four different compounds with confirmed glucosidase inhibitory activity, namely, salacinol, ponkoranol, kotalanol and de-O-sulfonated kotalanol. Separation could be achieved in less than 9 min, and calibration curves showed good linearity. Detection limits were determined to be in the low mug/mL range. This method was used to demonstrate that de-O-sulfonated kotalanol isolated from natural sources has identical ionic mobility to a synthetic standard. Furthermore, new extraction conditions were developed by which the zwitterionic compounds (salacinol, ponkoranol, and kotalanol) could be separated from de-O-sulfonated kotalanol in a single solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure. The extraction gave reproducibly high recoveries and was used to process four commercial Salacia extracts for CZE analysis to reduce the complexity of resulting electropherograms and to facilitate the detection of the four inhibitors in question. De-O-sulfonated kotalanol was detected in two of four Salacia samples while ponkoranol was present in all four. A comparison of all samples tested demonstrated that they had remarkably similar patterns of peaks, suggesting that this CZE method may be useful in the chemical fingerprinting of Salacia-containing products.",

      "abstract": "An approach to controlling blood glucose levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes is to target alpha-amylases and intestinal glucosidases using alpha-glucosidase inhibitors acarbose and miglitol. One of the intestinal glucosidases targeted is the N-terminal catalytic domain of maltase-glucoamylase (ntMGAM), one of the four intestinal glycoside hydrolase 31 enzyme activities responsible for the hydrolysis of terminal starch products into glucose. Here we present the X-ray crystallographic studies of ntMGAM in complex with a new class of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors derived from natural extracts of Salacia reticulata, a plant used traditionally in Ayuverdic medicine for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Included in these extracts are the active compounds salacinol, kotalanol, and de-O-sulfonated kotalanol. This study reveals that de-O-sulfonated kotalanol is the most potent ntMGAM inhibitor reported to date (K(i) = 0.03 microM), some 2000-fold better than the compounds currently used in the clinic, and highlights the potential of the salacinol class of inhibitors as future drug candidates.",

We have investigated, both in vivo and in vitro, whether the leaf of Salacia reticulata (SRL) can ameliorate collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) in mice as the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) model. The mice were fed a lard containing chow diet (AIN-93G) or the same diet containing 1% (w/w) SRL powder. All mice were bred for 23 days. On day 7 or 14 after LPS injection, mice were killed, and tissue and blood samples were collected. Histological analysis was performed, and serum levels of inflammatory mediators and the mRNA levels of inflammation-related genes and osteoclast-related genes were measured. SRL treatment ameliorated the rapid initial paw swelling, inflammatory cells infiltration, skeletal tissues damage, osteoclast activation and the mRNA levels for osteoclast-related genes compared with the CAIA mice. However, the serum and mRNA levels of inflammatory mediators did not differ between the CAIA mice and the SRL-treated mice. SRL might reduce the inflammatory cells induction and skeletal tissue degradation by CAIA by the regulating osteoclastogenesis."

Body weight, food intake, plasma biochemistry, visceral and subcutaneous fat (X-ray and CT), glucose tolerance, blood pressure and pain tolerance were measured, and histopathological examination of the liver was carried out. A significant dose-dependent decline in the gain in body weight, accumulation of visceral and subcutaneous fat and an improvement of abnormal glucose tolerance, hypertension and peripheral neuropathy were noticed in TSOD mice. In addition, hepatocellular swelling, fatty degeneration of hepatocytes, inflammatory cell infiltration and single-cell necrosis were observed on histopathological examination of the liver in TSOD mice. Salacia extract markedly improved these symptoms upon treatment. Based on the above results, it is concluded that Salacia extract has remarkable potential to prevent obesity and associated metabolic disorders including the development of metabolic syndrome."

Fifty-one patients with type II diabetes mellitus for longer than 6 months and with evidence of stable glycaemic control over the preceding 6 months (as assessed by HbA1C) participated in the study. They were randomised to receive a standard preparation of Kothala Himbutu tea for 3 months followed by placebo in similar tea bags for a further 3 months (n = 28) or in reverse order (n = 23). All patients received detailed advice on diet, exercise and lifestyle modification. HbA1C was measured at recruitment, at 3 months and on completion of the study at 6 months. Liver and renal functions were assessed biochemically at baseline, at 3 and 6 months and adverse events were recorded. There were no significant differences between the two groups in age, body mass index, male/female ratio, glycaemic control and baseline laboratory tests. All patients completed both arms of the trial. The HbA1C at the end of drug treatment was significantly lower than after treatment with placebo (6.29 +/- S.D. 1.02 versus 6.65 +/- S.D. 1.04; P = 0.008). A statistically significant fall in HBA1c was seen with the active drug compared to a rise in HbA1C with the placebo group (0. 54 +/- S.D. 0.93) versus -0.3 +/-S.D. 1.05; P < 0.001. The daily mean dose of Glibenclamide fell by 1.89 (S.D. 6.2) mg in the drug treated group but rose by 2.25 mg in the placebo treated group (P = 0.07). The differences in the metformin dose were not significantly significant in the two groups. We conclude that Kothala Himbutu tea is an effective and safe treatment for type 2 diabetes.",

It is recognized that some clinically used antidiabetic drugs have harmful effects on pregnancy but the effects of the S. reticulata root extract on reproductive outcome is unknown and deserves examination. We determined the effects of the S. reticulata root extract on the reproductive outcome of Wistar rats (250-260 g) when administered orally (10 g/kg) during early (days 1-7) and mid- (days 7-14) pregnancy. The root extract significantly (P<0.05) enhanced post-implantation losses (control vs treatment: early pregnancy, 4.7 2.4 vs 49.3 13%; mid-pregnancy, 4.7 2.4 vs 41.7 16.1%).
