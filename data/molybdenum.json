      "abstract": "Carbon-based electrodes are the most commonly used electrode materials for vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs). Due to the use of aqueous electrolytes in VRFBs, the first challenge is the hydrophobicity properties of carbon-based electrodes, and the second challenge is that the desired redox reaction on the positive side, VO2+/VO2 +, competes with the oxygen evolution reaction. Therefore, a proper surface treatment is needed. In the present work, three different brands of carbon papers (Sigracet 28AA, Toray 060, and Freudenberg H23) were treated with heat treatment and an MXene coating. For the latter, a two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum titanium carbide (Mo2TiC2T x ) was chosen and the drop-casting method was used for coating on carbon papers. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed MXene distribution and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed the presence of Mo and Ti on the electrode surface. Cyclic voltammetry tests revealed that the vanadium reaction rate, 7.76 × 10-4 cm s-1, and diffusion coefficient, 5.51 × 10-5 cm2 s-1, using Mo2TiC2T x MXene-coated carbon papers are comparable with when heat-treated carbon paper, 1.41 × 10-3 cm s-1 and 1.32 × 10-4 cm2 s-1, is used. VRFB tests were conducted over 150 cycles. Although a higher resistance of 1.2 Ω cm2 was observed for VRFB using Mo2TiC2T x MXene-coated carbon papers versus heat-treated, 0.8 Ω cm2, the energy efficiency of 71% was reasonably comparable to 79% for the system using heat-treated electrodes. More importantly, the same discharge capacity retention of 75% was achieved for both systems. The chemical stability of the Mo2TiC2T x MXene coating was confirmed by XPS post-analysis of electrodes where similar peaks for the freshly coated electrodes were observed. This work further broadens the potential applications of MXene coating as a treatment for carbon electrodes."

      "abstract": "Molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂) nanomaterials have attracted significant interest in cancer diagnosis and therapy due to their unique physicochemical properties. Due to its extensive surface area and adaptable structure, MoS₂ may engage with pharmaceuticals and biomolecules via covalent and non-covalent interactions. This versatility enhances the sensitivity of identifying specific biomarkers, colloidal stability, and tumor-targeting capabilities. In the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum, MoS₂ exhibits strong optical absorption and efficient photothermal conversion, making it suitable for NIR-driven phototherapy and regulated medication release. Functionalized MoS₂ nanocomposites react differently to the tumor microenvironment, which improves treatment effectiveness by increasing drug accumulation at cancer sites and decreasing off-target effects on healthy tissues. Recent developments in MoS₂-based nanocomposites for cancer detection and treatment are reviewed in this study, with particular attention paid to their uses in photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, biosensing, and bioimaging. Additionally, it looks at the difficulties and potential applications of MoS₂ nanocomposites in cancer."

      "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) is widely used in maize (Zea mays L.) production. The supply of molybdenum (Mo) can increase the recovery of N by the plant due to the role of this micronutrient in the assimilation of nitrate through nitrate reductase (NR). We aimed to evaluate N metabolism and auxiliary measurements in maize as affected by combined N and Mo omission or supply under controlled conditions. Plants were grown for 28 d in a nutrient solution without Mo and N, with Mo and N, and under the omission of Mo or N. The treatments with omission received nutrients with foliar application or via nutrient solution after 28 d. Gas exchange, chlorophyll and anthocyanins indexes, and N accumulation were evaluated at 28, 35, and 44 d after transplanting (DAT). The amino acid profile was altered due to Mo and N supply to the plants, as well as the uptake and accumulation of nitrate. The highest biomass production was quantified in the positive control, supplied by the nutrient solution and later by the absence of Mo, being the foliar application inferior to this treatment. Maize biomass, with the omission of N and Mo, was 31 % lower than the supply of both nutrients. Molybdenum favors nitrate uptake by maize, mainly when supplied through the nutrient solution."

      "abstract": "Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) are detrimental to the brain that can result in neurological impairment and inhibiting neurological functionals recovery after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, there is still a lack of effective treatment for ICH, either with medicine or neurosurgery. Nanozymes with excellent superoxide dismutase and catalase properties can scavenge ROS and may provide therapeutic opportunities for ICH patients. However, the ability of nanozymes to non-invasively target cerebral hemorrhage lesions and further antioxidation effect are still unknown. Herein, neutrophile membrane-disguised molybdenum-based polyoxometalate nanozymes (POM@Mem) were developed to alleviate oxidative stress after ICH. Coating with neutrophil membrane allowed POM to target the hemorrhage sites and further inhibit ROS generation. POM@Mem can improve neuroinflammatory microenvironment and promote behavioral improvement of ICH mouse. Combining neutrophile membrane and nanozymes for targeting brain hemorrhage sites provides an effective strategy for the treatment of ICH. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) are detrimental to the brain and can lead to neurological impairment, hindering the recovery of neurological functions after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Despite this, effective treatments for ICH, whether pharmaceuticals or neurosurgery, remain scarce. In this study, we developed neutrophil membrane-disguised molybdenum-based polyoxometalate nanozymes (POM@Mem) as a novel approach to alleviate oxidative stress following ICH. The neutrophil membrane coating enabled the POM nanozymes to specifically target hemorrhagic sites, thereby inhibiting ROS production. Additionally, POM@Mem improved the neuroinflammatory microenvironment and facilitated behavioral recovery in ICH mice. The combination of neutrophil membranes and nanozymes for targeted delivery to brain hemorrhage sites offers a promising strategy for the treatment of ICH."

      "abstract": "Large quantities of soil excavated from civil engineering projects are found to contain leachable contaminants, including metallic oxyanions like molybdate. This study presents a novel treatment approach by identifying a mixture of magnesium oxide (MgO) and hydraulic binders for the stabilization and solidification (S/S) of molybdenum-contaminated limestone tunnel sludge. XRD analysis and geochemical modeling revealed the presence of brucite in all samples, suggesting that the immobilization mechanism was likely molybdate sorption onto brucite. The addition of cement enhanced the geotechnical properties and improved sulfate retention through the formation of ettringite. Considering efficiency and a low CO2 footprint, the S/S formulation consisting of 1 wt% MgO and 3 wt% limestone calcined clay cement (LC3) was selected for this study. Environmental assessments were conducted using leaching test standards, including US EPA 1313 to assess pH sensitivity, US EPA 1311 (TCLP) and EN 12457-2 to evaluate the effects of curing time, at intervals from 6 hours to 90 days. Results showed that molybdenum release remained below 0.05 mg/L (the European inert waste threshold) after just 24 hours of curing, with further improvements over time under alkaline conditions. However, the treatment was ineffective at neutral or acidic pH due to brucite dissolution. The S/S of molybdenum-contaminated sludge using MgO and LC3 proved highly efficient for Mo immobilization and is suitable for industrial applications."

      "abstract": "Molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD) Type A is an ultrarare disorder causing neurodegeneration and early death. Cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP), a molybdenum cofactor precursor, is a therapeutic option for patients with MoCD Type A. In this study, efficacy in patients with MoCD Type A treated with recombinant cPMP (rcPMP) and/or fosdenopterin, a synthetic form of cPMP, from one retrospective and two prospective open-label studies (N = 14), was compared with a retrospective/prospective natural history study (untreated; N = 37). Safety was evaluated in treated patients. Patients treated with fosdenopterin/rcPMP had significantly reduced risk of premature/early death versus untreated patients (Cox proportional hazards 5.1; 95% CI 1.32-19.36; p = 0.01). MoCD disease biomarkers of urinary S-sulfocysteine and xanthine returned to near-normal from baseline to last visit in treated patients but remained abnormal in untreated patients. At 12 months, in treated patients, 43% could sit unassisted, 44% were ambulatory, and 57% could feed orally. Initiating fosdenopterin/rcPMP treatment ≤ 14 days after birth appeared to result in better clinical outcomes than initiating > 14 days after birth. Most patients (13/14) had a treatment-emergent adverse event; most were unrelated to fosdenopterin/rcPMP, were mild to moderate in severity, and none led to treatment discontinuation. These results demonstrate that patients with MoCD Type A who received fosdenopterin/rcPMP versus untreated patients were more likely to survive. Some treated patients were able to feed orally and achieve developmental milestones including walking. Fosdenopterin/rcPMP was generally well-tolerated. Improved outcomes in patients treated early support the importance of identifying MoCD in neonates and initiating treatment as soon as possible.",

      "abstract": "Sepsis, an inflammatory disease caused by bacterial infection, has become a global public health crisis. Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) in sepsis patients act as the primary trigger for activating intracellular immune pathways, ultimately leading to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The overexpression of acidic metabolites and ROS, characteristic of the infected microenvironment, significantly impedes sepsis treatment. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), a cytosolic DNA sensor, plays a key role in inflammatory diseases. The detrimental effects of STING in sepsis have been well documented. Here, we developed a pH-responsive nanotherapy platform (DMSNM@C-178/PAA) that combines ROS scavenging with cGAS-STING pathway inhibition for anti-inflammatory therapy. This nanoparticle is selectively released in the infected microenvironment, where reduced molybdenum-based polyoxometalates (Mo-POM) efficiently neutralize toxic ROS in vivo, while C-178 selectively inhibits the cGAS-STING pathway, thereby attenuating the inflammatory response and preventing organ deterioration. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that DMSNM@C-178/PAA treats sepsis by eliminating excess ROS and modulating autoimmune dysfunction via the cGAS-STING pathway, providing a novel therapeutic strategy for sepsis management.",

This novel approach achieves efficient separation and recovery of molybdenum, with a molybdenum-aluminum separation coefficient of 19,258.26 and a molybdenum recovery rate of 98.95%. The purity of the molybdenum product attained through single-stage extraction is 93.83%, which increases to 99.7% with three-stage extraction. Life cycle assessment indicates that this process reduces CO2 emissions by 42.4% and SO2 emissions by 73.7% compared to traditional methods.

      "abstract": "Molybdenum cofactor deficiencies (MoCD) are a group of inborn errors of metabolism that result in impaired synthesis of molybdenum cofactor, crucial for the function of three oxidases (sulfite oxidase, xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase). Most patients present with severe neonatal-onset epileptic encephalopathy, hypotonia, poor feeding and apnoea, with death typically occurring within the first three years of life. Whilst there is now an emerging therapy for MoCD Type A (cPMP/fosdenopterin), this treatment is not effective for MoCD Type B and there is no treatment for isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency (ISOD). Liver directed gene delivery is a potential alternative therapy for sulfite intoxication disorders. We report an attempt to use hepatocyte transplantation as a treatment option for MoCD Type B, in an infant with a strong family history of neonatal-onset disease and early mortality. Six transfusions of hepatocytes were given between Day 1 and Day 18 of life, totalling around 1 × 109 cells with immunosuppressive cover. Concomitantly dietary protein restriction was maintained at 2 g/kg, including 0.7 g/kg of methionine- and cyst(e)ine-free amino acid mixture. The aim was to utilize hepatocyte transplantation as a bridge to liver transplantation. Whilst there was evidence of biochemical stabilization with reduction in concentrations of sulfite and S-sulfocysteine and a moderate increase in urate levels compared to the sibling, the treatment was not able to prevent acute brain injury from sulfite toxicity which was evident in neuroimaging at 35 h of age. This correlated clinically with ongoing seizures as well as minimal developmental progress.",

However, little is known about the transformations and toxicity evolution of MoS2 during chlorination. This study discovered that MoS2 is unstable to NaClO exposure, and more soluble ions are released under UV/NaClO co-treatment due to the generation of •OH and chlorine radicals. Compared to NaClO alone, UV/NaClO treatment caused significant structural disorder and compositional alterations in MoS2 (oxidation and chlorine incorporation), reducing its colloidal stability and hydrophilicity. Relative to pristine MoS2, chlorinated MoS2 showed stronger toxic effects against algae, including strengthened envelopment, morphological shrinkage and inner membrane collapse. Chlorination clearly intensified the abiotic and biotic ROS-dependent oxidative stress of MoS2, leading to exacerbated cell growth (34.6 % at 10 μg/mL) and photosynthesis inhibition, and membrane damage. Metabolomics confirmed the aggravated toxicity of chlorinated MoS2 in terms of the down-regulation of carbohydrates, amino acids, unsaturated fatty acids, and TCA cycle. This study underlines the significant role of chlorination processes in modifying MoS2 ecotoxicity and proposes the necessity to systematically assess the risks of MoS2-based nanomaterials while developing water treatment processes accordingly."

      "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common clinical kidney dysfunction associated with high morbidity, elevated mortality, and poor prognosis. It results from redox imbalance caused by abnormal excess production of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the renal tubules, which in turn initiates a series of pathological processes, such as cellular apoptosis, necrosis, and ferroptosis, eventually leading to structural and functional impairment of the kidney. Thereinto, ferroptosis induced by the lethal accumulation of lipid peroxidation is extensively involved in renal damage. Nanotechnology-mediated therapeutic strategies to scavenge excessive ROS and thereby inhibit ferroptosis represents a promising strategy for AKI management. Herein, we report two engineered ultrathin molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets (NSs) modified with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and bovine serum albumin (BSA), respectively, with excellent biocompatibility and antioxidative defense capability for AKI treatment. The engineered NSs, with a readily variable valence state of molybdenum ions, rescued cell viability by consuming various forms of cellular ROS and significantly facilitated glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) expression to mitigate ferroptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells. In a glycerol-induced AKI mouse model, the PVP-MoS2 NSs were largely accumulated in the injured kidneys, where they provided robust antioxidative protection against ROS attack and suppressed the oxidative stress-induced inflammatory response, thereby maintaining normal kidney function. Of the two engineered NSs, PVP-MoS2 displayed superior biological stability and therapeutic effects and could thus serve as a powerful antioxidant platform for use in the treatment of AKI and other ROS-associated diseases. This study underscores the potential of two-dimensional nanomaterials in precisely treating AKI and other ferroptosis-related diseases.",

      "abstract": "Molybdenum has gained attention as a promising biomedical material due to its excellent mechanical properties and inherent antimicrobial activity. However, challenges remain in developing facile fabrication methods and further enhancing its antimicrobial efficacy. This study pioneers the investigation of biofilm inhibition by laser-treated molybdenum sheets against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27853) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC25923). The experimental results demonstrate that nanosecond-pulsed laser processing significantly suppresses biofilm formation, reducing the minimum optical density (OD) values by 25.3% and 64.9% for the two bacterial strains, respectively. The laser treatment modifies the surface morphology of molybdenum by eliminating defects, reducing the effective contact area, and lowering hydrophobicity. Additionally, localized laser heating induces the formation of MoO3 on the surface, which reacts with water to generate molybdic acid-a key contributor to antibacterial activity. These findings highlight nanosecond-pulsed laser processing as a cost-effective, scalable surface-modification strategy for medical-grade molybdenum. This approach holds significant potential for broadening the antimicrobial applications of molybdenum-based biomedical devices and implants."

      "abstract": "Metallic molybdenum (Mo) has been increasingly recognized as a potential biodegradable metal for biomedical implants. However, the macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses to Mo-based implants remain underexplored. This study examined the in vitro inflammatory reactions of macrophages to the degradation products of biodegradable Mo implants. The short-term and long-term biodegradation behavior and the subsequent impact on cytotoxicity, metabolism, and macrophage polarization were assessed. Both Mo and its degradation products were shown to be non-toxic within macrophage tolerance limits. Nevertheless, morphological changes and pro-inflammatory polarization were observed in cells around Mo-based specimen. Notably, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (Mmp9) was identified as a key gene influencing macrophage polarization in proximity to Mo. Additionally, pre-treating the Mo specimens in culture medium for 24 h significantly mitigated its stimulatory effects on cells. These results demonstrated the significance of optimizing Mo pre-treatment methods to prevent localized inflammation associated with its degradation. Specifically, pre-treatment of Mo can effectively mitigate the adverse impacts of its early degradation on macrophages and the surrounding immune environment. Our research into these early degradation phases introduces new avenues for studying molybdenum's immunomodulatory properties, potentially through precise control of its release and the targeted expression of pivotal genes."

However, piezocatalytic therapy encounters obstacles such as suboptimal piezoelectric responses, rapid electron-hole recombination, inefficient energy harvesting, and the complexities of the tumor microenvironment. In this study, sulfur vacancy-engineered cobalt (Co) single-atom doped molybdenum disulfide (SA-Co@MoS2) nanoflowers are strategically designed, which exhibit enhanced piezoelectric effects. Specifically, the introduction of Co single atom not only induces lattice distortion and out-of-plane polarization but also leads to the formation of numerous sulfur vacancies. These changes collectively narrow the intrinsic bandgap of the material, facilitating effective separation and migration of charge carriers, and enabling efficient production of reactive oxygen species under ultrasound stimulation. Additionally, the SA-Co@MoS2 nanoflowers demonstrate improved enzymatic activity and exhibit glutathione depletion capabilities attributed to the mixed valence states of Co, intensifying oxidative stress in tumor cells, and leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, while the inactivation of glutathione peroxidase 4 induces ferroptosis. Both in vitro and in vivo results indicate that SA-Co@MoS2 nanoflowers can significantly eliminate tumor cells. This study offers valuable insights into the exploration of single-atom doping-enhanced piezoelectric sonosensitizers for cancer treatment, potentially paving the way for advancements in the field of piezocatalytic synergistic enzyodynamic therapy.",

Although NIMO is used to treat stroke, migraine, Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular spasms, and hypertension, this drug is poorly water-soluble, with low bioavailability and lack of selectivity. Thus, there is an urgent need for a novel approach to creating NIMO formulations that are safe, effective, and have better solubility and bioavailability. To overcome these problems, we develop a cationic biopolymer functionalized MoS2 nanosheets as a photothermal drug carrier system to facilitate the NIR light-induced release of NIMO drugs. MoS2 nanosheets (<150 nm) as NIMO drug carriers are prepared through simple exfoliation of their bulk phase and then functionalized with CHIT-SH biopolymer to increase their physiological stability and biocompatibility. According to the results, MoS2-NIMO-CHIT-SH nanocomposites show strong NIR absorbance, which makes them a promising candidate for photothermal therapy.",

To address this, we carried out a field study with two treatments, i.e., Mo applied (+Mo) and without Mo (-Mo) treatment to explore the effects of Mo application on crop growth and development, microbial diversity, and metabolite variations in maize and soybean cropping systems. Our results indicated that the nutrient availability (N, P, K) was higher under Mo supply leading to improved biological yield and nutrient uptake efficiency in both crops. Microbial community analysis revealed that Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria were the dominant phyla in Mo treated (+Mo) soils for both maize and soybean. Both these phyla accounted together 39.43% and 57.74% in -Mo and +Mo, respectively, in soybean rhizosphere soil, while they accounted for 44.51% and 46.64% in maize rhizosphere soil. This indicates more variations among the treatments in soybean soil compared to maize soil. At a lower taxonomic level, the diverse responses of the genera indicated the specific bacterial community adaptations to fertilization. Candidatus Koribacter and Kaistobacter were commonly significantly higher in both crops under Mo-applied conditions in both cropping systems. These taxa, sharing similar functions, could serve as potential markers for nutrient availability and soil fertility. Metabolite profiling revealed 8 and 10 significantly differential metabolites in maize and soybean, respectively, under +Mo treatment, highlighting the critical role of Mo in metabolite variation. Overall, these findings emphasize the importance of Mo in shaping soil microbial diversity by altering metabolite composition, which in turn may enhance the nutrient availability, nutrient uptake, and plant performance."

      "abstract": "With the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant bacterial infections, wound bacterial infections have evolved into an escalating medical problem that poses a threat to the individual health as well as global public health. Traditional drug therapy not only suffers from a single treatment method, low drug utilisation and limited therapeutic effect, but long-term antibiotic abuse has significantly increased bacterial resistance. It is imperative to develop an antibiotic-free biomaterial with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. The current use of photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) relies on the generation of massive reactive oxygen species (ROS), which inevitably aggravates the inflammatory response. Herein, we developed AuAg bimetallic nanoparticles based on PDA modification and prepared a novel MoS2-based composite nanomaterials (AuAg@PDA-MoS2 NPs) with multiple mechanisms of antibacterial and anti-inflammatory potentials through the adhesion of PDA. In the early phase, PDT and PTT generated a large amount of ROS for rapid sterilisation. While in the later stage, MoS2 mimicked the peroxidase activity to leverage the ROS, balancing the generation of ROS in the infected environment to achieve the long-term anti-inflammatory. In vitro experiments showed that the killing efficiency of AuAg@PDA-MoS2 NPs was nearly 99 % under the irradiation of 808 nm near-infrared light for 10 min, which demonstrated excellent antibacterial activity. In vivo experiments showed that 808 nm NIR-assisted AuAg@PDA-MoS2 NPs to effectively inhibit infection, alleviated the inflammation, and accelerated the wound healing process. Therefore, AuAg@PDA-MoS2 NPs as a novel biomaterial could achieve programmed antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects, which has a promising potential for future application in the treatment of infected wounds."

In order to investigate the effect mechanism of nitrogen fertilizer combined with foliar molybdenum fertilizer on millet yield and antioxidant enzyme activity, two nitrogen application gradients (N0 (0 kg/hm2) and N1 (75 kg/hm2) were set with millet variety Changnong 47 as material. Leaf molybdenum fertilizer Mo0 (0 %), Mo1 (0.1 %), Mo2 (0.2 %), Mo3 (0.3 %) and Mo4 (0.4 %) were sprayed at the joining stage. Photosynthetic parameters, chlorophyll content, antioxidant enzyme activity, dry matter accumulation and yield at the complete ripening stage were measured. After the analysis of significant difference, the results showed that the combined application of molybdenum nitrogen significantly increased the yield of millet, and the maximum yield under the Mo3 treatment was 5869.04 kg/hm2 under the N1 condition, which was 13% higher than that under the no fertilization treatment. The total dry matter accumulation was 36.96 g/ plant, which was 31% higher than that without fertilization. The net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and stomatal conductivity (gs) increased first and then decreased with the increase of molybdenum fertilizer concentration gradient, and reached the maximum values under N1Mo3 condition, which were 24.77 μmol•m-2•s-1 and 391.33 mol•m-2•s-1, respectively. Application of molybdenum fertilizer can improve the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) in the test samples. In conclusion, under N1 condition, Mo3 (0.3%) treatment can effectively improve millet yield, photosynthetic characteristics and antioxidant enzyme activity. The results of this study provided theoretical basis and data support for the application of nitrogen and molybdenum fertilizer in millet production."

However, the interactions between cell wall biosynthesis and molybdenum have not been explored sufficiently. This study thoroughly investigated the regulatory effects of different concentrations of Mo on tobacco cell wall biosynthesis from physiological and metabolomic aspects. The results indicate that Mo treatment increased the Mo content of tobacco variety K326. Moreover, it significantly up-regulated the gene expression levels of molybdases (NR, AO, SO, XDH) and molybdate transporters in tobacco, whereby the gene expression levels of NR were upregulated by 28.48%, 52.51%, 173.05%, and 246.21%, respectively; and MOT1 and MOT2 were upregulated by 21.49/8.67%, 66.05/30.44%, 93.05/93.26%, and 166.11/114.29%, respectively. Additionally, Mo treatment regulated the synthesis of related enzymes, effectively promoted plant growth, and significantly increased biomass and dry matter accumulation, with the biomass in the leaves increasing significantly by 30.73%, 40.72%, 46.34%, and 12.88%, respectively. The FT-NIR spectroscopy results indicate that after Mo was applied to the soil, the quantity of C-O-C, -COOH, C-H, and N-H functional groups increased. Concurrently, the contents of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, protopectin, and soluble pectin in the leaves significantly increased, wherein the content of soluble pectin and hemicellulose increased significantly by 31.01/288.82%, 40.69/343.43%, 69.93/241.73%, and 196.88/223.26%, respectively. Furthermore, the cell walls thickened, increasing the ability of the plant to withstand disturbances. The metabolic network diagrams indicate that Mo regulated galactose metabolism, and arginine and proline acid biosynthesis. The contents of carbohydrates, spermidine, proline, quinic acid, IAA, flavonoids, and other substances were increased, increasing the levels of polysaccharides and pectin within the cell wall, controlling lignin production, and successfully enhancing resistance to abiotic stress. These results offer important perspectives for further investigations into the role of trace elements."

SUMMARY ANSWER: Elevated plasma molybdenum level is associated with an increased risk of idiopathic POI through vascular endothelial injury and inhibition of granulosa cell proliferation. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Excessive molybdenum exposure has been associated with ovarian oxidative stress in animals but its role in the development of POI remains unknown. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Case-control study of 30 women with idiopathic POI and 31 controls enrolled from August 2018 to May 2019. In vitro experimentation. Animal studies using distilled water containing sodium molybdate. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Logistic regression analysis of the association between plasma concentrations of molybdenum and calcium and POI odds ratio. Plasma samples were from 30 patients with idiopathic POI and 31 controls. Both groups were comparable in terms of age and body mass index. Proliferation assay, flow cytometry analyses for cell cycle, nitric oxide and calcium, gene expression, and protein analysis using human umbilical vein endothelial cells and KGN (human ovarian granulosa-like tumor cell line) cells. Sexual hormones, ovarian function, vascular injury, and platelet activation were evaluated in mice exposed to excessive molybdenum. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Case-control study showed that the elevation of plasma concentrations of molybdenum and calcium was positively associated with the POI odds ratio. In vitro study showed that molybdenum treatment increased the permeability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells through enhancing nitric oxide generation and cytosolic calcium influx. In vivo study showed that increased vascular permeability induced by molybdenum resulted in platelet activation and serotonin release within mouse ovaries. Serotonin decreased granulosa cell proliferation by inducing cellular quiescence. Molybdenum also directly inhibited granulosa cell proliferation by downregulating isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1). Inhibition of granulosa cell proliferation ultimately led to ovarian dysfunction in mice, including altered estrus cycles, serum sex hormone concentrations, ovarian morphology, and ovarian reserve. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: There are two limitations in the current study. First, it remains unclear whether the elevation of plasma molybdenum content is due to environmental exposure or altered metabolism. Second, rigorous and multicenter studies, with a larger sample size, should be carried out to confirm the elevation of plasma molybdenum and calcium concentrations in patients with idiopathic POI. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our findings highlight an association between elevated plasma concentrations of molybdenum and calcium and increased risk of idiopathic POI. This discovery offers crucial insights into the pathogenesis of idiopathic POI and the search for effective preventive measures.

      "abstract": "Humic substances, such as Fulvic acid (FA) and humic acid (HA), are widely used for the remediation of heavy metal-contaminated soils due to their ability to enhance metal mobility and facilitate plant uptake. In this study, we conducted a pot experiment with alfalfa to investigate the effects of FA and HA amendments on the mobility of molybdenum (Mo) in the soil, its uptake by alfalfa plants, and subsequent changes in the microbial community. The results demonstrated that both FA and HA influence Mo accumulation in the soil and plants. Specifically, HA treatment increased Mo concentrations in alfalfa shoots and roots by 1.08-1.19 times and 1.19-2.43 times, respectively, compared to the control. In contrast, FA enhanced Mo concentrations in alfalfa roots (1.05-1.58 times) but reduced Mo levels in the shoots (0.78-0.85 times). Furthermore, the addition of FA and HA altered the chemical speciation of Mo in the soil, promoting the conversion of reducible and oxidizable fraction to more exchangeable and residual fraction. As a result, the proportion of non-residual Mo fractions (exchangeable, reducible, and oxidizable) decreased from 87.48% to 80.30-87.35%, while residual fractions increased from 12.52% to 12.65-19.70%. Additionally, the structure of the soil bacterial community was primarily influenced by changes in soil properties such as cation exchange capacity, available phosphorus, and ammonium nitrogen levels. This finding highlight the potential of FA and HA to enhance Mo availability, uptake, and translocation in alfalfa, suggesting that their application could be an effective strategy for phytoremediation of Mo-contaminated soils, particularly when alfalfa is used as a hyperaccumulator.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD) is a rare metabolic disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the highly conserved biosynthetic pathway of molybdenum cofactor (MoCo), resulting in sulfite intoxication. MoCD may present in a clinically severe, fatal form marked by intractable seizures after birth, hyperekplexia, microcephaly and cerebral atrophy, or a later onset form with a more varied clinical course. Three types of MoCD have been described based on the effected gene along the MoCo synthesis pathway: type A (MOCS1); type B (MOCS2 or MOCS3) and type C (GPHN). The MOCS2 gene is bicistronic, encoding the small (MOCS2A) and large (MOCS2B) subunits with an overlapping coding region. This case report describes a patient with the first known variant causative of mild disease in the overlapping bicistronic region (c.263 G > C) and the first ever described in the highly conserved C-terminal glycine-glycine motif of MOCS2A. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient developed normally until age 12 months when she presented in the setting of acute illness with developmental regression, low serum uric acid, and MRI with bilateral globus pallidus (GP) injury. Exome sequencing identified a homozygous variant of unknown significance in the MOCS2 gene and the diagnosis of MoCD type B was confirmed by the patient's low serum uric acid coupled with elevated urine sulfocysteine and associated metabolites, resulting in gene reclassification. Nearly four years after her initial presentation she has demonstrated progress in language and motor domains, consistent with a mild phenotype of MoCD. CONCLUSIONS: The case emphasizes challenges in identifying atypical forms of rare diseases, the importance of exome sequencing to identify mild cases of MoCD, and the ongoing challenges with understanding the MOCS2 gene. While one FDA approved treatment exists for MoCD type A, further research into the mechanisms of phenotype-genotype differences among this patient population may aid in additional therapeutic options for MoCD.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD) classically presents shortly after birth, with neurological symptoms ascribed to postnatal toxicity of accumulating sulphite. Case reports suggest that cerebral damage associated with MoCD may have a prenatal onset. METHODS: A meta-analysis of case reports was performed on individuals with genetically proven MoCD retrieved through a systematic review and in-house search. Cases were categorized as classical or late-onset, based on the time of onset of symptoms. Available cerebral images were scored for the presence of restricted diffusion, pathological signal, subcortical cysts, and atrophy. Estimated onset of each event and the minimal number of events needed to explain the observed imaging abnormalities were deduced by combining age at imaging, type of imaging abnormality, and known natural evolution of the imaging abnormalities. RESULTS: Of a total of 30 retrieved cases, 21 were classical. Prenatal origin of damage was possible in all classical cases and certain in 11 of 21 (52%). Multiple events were deduced in 5/21 classical cases based on imaging data alone and in 11 of 21 cases when presuming that a postnatal onset of symptoms signifies a recent event. Multiple, but postnatal, events were also described in 3 of 9 late-onset cases. CONCLUSION: Prenatal onset of cerebral damage in patients with classical MoCD is more frequently encountered than anticipated. It may have been overlooked by the overwhelming postnatal symptoms erroneously pointing to a single culprit. This insight is important when counseling for prognosis, particularly in the context of considering the timing and anticipated prospects of therapeutic intervention."

Various scaffolding materials have been used for the construction of bone tissue, including metals, ceramics, and polymers. This study investigates an innovative liquid exfoliation approach for the production of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets using riboflavin (RF-MoS2) as an exfoliation agent and subsequently analytically characterized for the development of bone scaffolding system. UV analysis of RF-MoS2 shows the absorbance spectra at 610 and 668 nm and the particle size was 123 ± 4 nm and a surface charge of -16.1 ± 2 mV. Further, alginate-chitosan (Alg-Chi) and alginate-chitosan-riboflavin-MoS2 (Alg-Chi-RF-MoS2) nanocomposite scaffolds were developed. The morphology of the Alg-Chi-RF-MoS2 scaffold was studied using scanning electron microscopy and pore size was found to be 210 ± 10 μm. Alg-Chi-RF-MoS2 scaffolds generate calcium phosphate biominerals when immersed in a simulated body fluid. Alg-Chi and Alg-Chi-RF-MoS2 scaffolds were biocompatible with C3H10T1/2 cells, and scaffolds showed a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase and mineralization. Thus, the developed Alg-Chi-RF-MoS2 scaffold proved to be an appropriate artificial graft for bone graft substitution."

Herein, the formation of 3.4 and 4.1 nm nanorings, {Mo154} and {Mo176}, is monitored using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) with systematically varied synthetic conditions. Results suggest that {Mo154} forms quickly in solution and then undergoes slow transformation into {Mo176} when reducing agents are used, while {Mo176} can form directly with MoCl5 supplied as reduced MoV. These are attributed to {Mo154} being the kinetic product catalyzed by the template-effect while {Mo176} is the thermodynamic product due to its low ring tension. Our findings unravel one of the long-standing mysteries in MB and point out effective routes for the precise synthesis of nanorings."

The recycling of waste textiles, especially expensive silk fabrics, is of great significance for resource conservation and green, low-carbon cycle development. In addition, the development of precious metal-free electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains a major challenge. In this study, molybdenum carbide nanoparticle-decorated carbonized silk fabrics (Mo2C@CSF) were fabricated using a simple process, which can be directly employed as an HER electrode. The obtained materials exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic HER performance in acidic media with low overpotential (60 mV at 10 mA/cm2) and long-term stability (more than 24 h). This work will provide a fresh perspective on the treatment of waste silk fabrics and the fabrication of high-performance electrocatalysts."

      "abstract": "Heavy metal contamination of agricultural land due to sewage irrigation, over-application of fertilizers and pesticides, and industrial activities. Biochar, due to its rich functional groups and excellent electrochemical performance, is used for the remediation of heavy metal-contaminated farmland. However, the remediation mechanism remains uncertain due to the influence of minerals and multi-element composite pollution on soil. Therefore, introducing transition metal oxide MoO2 to prepare biochar composite remediation materials enhances the adsorption and reduction of soil Cr (Ⅵ). This study compared the differences in Cr (Ⅵ) improvement under different pollution systems and pH conditions and explored the potential mechanism of Fe (Ⅲ)/Fe (Ⅱ) redox cycling in Cr (Ⅵ) remediation. The results showed that both biochar MoO2 ball-milling composite (BC + M) and biochar-loaded MoO2 (BC/M) retained the original biochar (BC) remediation method for Cr (Ⅵ). Among them, the remediation of BC/M was the most stable, with the maximum remediation value ranging from approximately 6.52 to 58.58 mg/kg. In different pollution systems, Cd and Pb exhibited competitive adsorption toward Cr (Ⅵ), but they enhanced Cr (Ⅵ) remediation by promoting adsorption and self-complexation. In acidic conditions (pH = 4), BC/M showed the best remediation effect, with a reduction kinetic constant of 34.61 × 10-3 S-1 and a maximum adsorption capacity of 61.64 mg/g. Fe (Ⅲ)/Fe (Ⅱ) redox cycling accelerated the reduction of Cr (Ⅵ) (R2 = 0.81), and MoO2 promoted the Fe (Ⅲ)/Fe (Ⅱ) redox cycle. BC/M enhanced the Fe (Ⅱ) formation efficiency by 66.39% and 71.81% compared to BC + M and BC at pH = 4. The introduction of MoO2 and biochar composite materials enhanced the reduction process of Cr (Ⅵ), with BC/M achieving the optimal remediation level. This study reveals the potential mechanisms of MoO2 and biochar composite materials in soil Cr (Ⅵ) remediation, providing a reference and insight for the preparation of Cr (Ⅵ) remediation materials and the treatment of contaminated farmland.",

The child presented with hypoglycemia at the age of 10 h and was diagnosed because of the incidental finding of severely decreased L-cystine in plasma. Due to a high level of awareness and excellent co-operation between metabolic laboratory and clinical services, cPMP substitution could be initiated before severe encephalopathy set in, and the child subsequently had a normal motor development. The child has been continued on daily substitution with cPMP until today (age 7 years) and has shown a satisfying long-term developmental outcome. Long-term follow-up, however, revealed significant communication difficulties and cognitive abilities in the range of mild to moderate learning disability. The severity of the metabolic disease was confirmed by the extent of biochemical abnormalities and further functional characterisation of the underlying genetic variants. This case provides further evidence that cPMP substitution does significantly alter the disease course when applied early enough. Postnatal treatment in this case was not sufficient to enable an entirely normal cognitive development, despite sustained complete normalization of the biochemical abnormalities.",

The results showed that Mo disrupted the morphology and ultrastructure of PEECs, triggered blurred cell edges, cell swelling, cell cycle arrest, and increased apoptosis. At the molecular level, Mo treatment activated the TGF-β1/SMAD2 and PI3K/AKT1 pathways, causing a significant increase in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and MMP-2 protein expression. Accompanied by markedly increased tissue inhibitors matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2 and decreased TIMP-1, the balance of MMP2/TIMP-2 and MMP-9/TIMP-1 were disrupted. Ultimately, the receptivity of PEECs was destroyed by excessive Mo, which is revealed by the significant decrease of receptive marker molecules, including leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), integrins β3 (ITGβ3), heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). To sum up, the current study demonstrated the potential toxicity of Mo to PEECs, indicating reproductive toxicity at high Mo concentrations and suggesting that the content of Mo should be evaluated as a potential risk factor.",

In this study, we demonstrate a highly sensitive recombinant human caspase-3 (rhC3) detection technique in biological fluids. This technique uses a copper nanocluster stabilized with bovine serum albumin (BSA-CuNCs) as a metal-based fluorescent biosensor, conjugated with anti-human caspase-3 (ahC3). To turn its fluorescence off, molybdenum disulfide nanosheets (MoS2 NSs) are added; this partnership is termed ahC3@BSA-CuNCs/MoS2 nanocouple. In the presence of rhC3, the energy transfer process is affected by strong ahC3/rhC3 interactions. When in close proximity, the rhC3 molecules cause detachment of the nanocluster from the MoS2 NS surface by attracting the ahC3 component of the nanocluster. This increases the distance between the nanocluster and quencher with a consequent restoration of intensity. As the concentration of rhC3 increases, the fluorescence intensity of the system also increases. A proportional response is seen in the concentration between 0.1 and 1.3 ng/mL with a very low limit of detection of 2.75 pg/mL and a quantification limit of 8.60 pg/mL. A simple filter paper strip was made to visually identify the presence of rhC3 under UV light.",

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) manifests as the degradation of cartilage and remodeling of subchondral bone. Restoring homeostasis within the joint is imperative for alleviating OA symptoms. Current interventions primarily target singular aspects, such as anti-aging, inflammation inhibition, free radical scavenging, and regeneration of cartilage and subchondral bone. Herein, we developed molybdenum nanodots (MNDs) as bionic photothermal nanomaterials to mimic the antioxidant synthase to concurrently protected cartilage and facilitate subchondral bone regeneration. With near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, MNDs effectively eliminate reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) from OA chondrocytes, thereby reversed mitochondrial dysfunction, mitigating chondrocyte senescence, and simultaneously suppresses inflammation, hence preserving the inherent homeostasis between cartilage matrix synthesis and degradation while circumventing safety concerns. RNA sequencing of OA chondrocytes treated with MNDs-NIR revealed the reinstatement of chondrocyte functionality, activation of antioxidant enzymes, anti-aging properties, and regulation of inflammation. NIR irradiation induces thermogenesis and synergistically promotes subchondral bone regeneration via MNDs, as validated through histological assessments and microcomputed tomography (Micro-CT) scans. MNDs-NIR effectively attenuate cellular senescence and inhibit inflammation in vivo, while also remodeling mitochondrial dynamics by upregulating fusion proteins and inhibiting fission proteins, thereby regulating the oxidative stress microenvironment. Additionally, MNDs-NIR exhibited remarkable therapeutic effects in alleviating articular cartilage degeneration in an OA mouse model, evidenced by a 1.67-fold reduction in subchondral bone plate thickness, an 88.57 % decrease in OARSI score, a 5.52-fold reduction in MMP13 expression, and a 6.80-fold increase in Col II expression. This novel disease-modifying approach for OA utilizing MNDs-NIR offers insight and a paradigm for improving mitochondrial dysfunction by regulating the accumulation of mitochondrial ROS and ultimately alleviating cellular senescence. Moreover, the dual-pronged therapeutic approach of MNDs-NIR, which addresses both cartilage erosion and subchondral bone lesions in OA, represents a highly promising strategy for managing OA.",

Thus, the efficient recovery of Np from HLLW via the TRPO (trialkylphosphine oxide) process is not only beneficial for radioactive contamination remediation but also boosts the recycling of precious nuclear resources. However, this process including Np(V)-Np(IV) conversion is highly dependent on the components coexisting in HLLW, and its underlying mechanism is still not clear, restricting the recovery of Np in multiple scenarios. Herein, the effect of coexisting metal ions on the reduction and extraction of Np(V) was studied, and molybdenum (Mo) was identified to play a vital role in this course. Additionally, in combination with absorption spectral analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and solvent extraction, the promotion of the extraction of Np by Mo was elucidated to be due to the catalytic reduction effect both in the aqueous phase and organic phase. This study can help researchers better understand the redox chemistry of Np in the treatment of HLLW."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Molybdenum (Mo) plays a crucial role in regulating normal physiological function. However, its potential effect on female infertility has received little attention. METHODS: In this study, we explored the potential molecular mechanisms of Mo's action on mouse ovaries and oocytes by establishing a busulfan-induced infertility model. Adult female Kunming mice were randomly divided into three groups: control, +busulfan, and +busulfan+Mo. After 30 days of busulfan treatment [Myleran, 20 mg/kg body weight ip], mice in the busulfan+Mo group were provided with 7.5 mg/L Mo per day in drinking water for an additional 42 days. On day 72, we examined the morphology of the oocytes and ovarian tissue after H&E staining, measured the concentrations of serum hormones by ELISA, and detected Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-3 and caspase-9 by immunohistochemical staining and western immunoblotting. We also assessed the oxidative stress in cells by measuring the activity of the antioxidant enzyme, SOD, the concentrations of MDA and LDH, and the percentage of apoptotic cells using kits. The number of litters born was counted after mating with male mice, and the organ coefficients were calculated after weighing on an analytic balance. RESULTS: Results showed that Mo treatment restored female reproductive hormone levels to near normal. Mo also significantly inhibited the mitochondrial stress-induced expression of apoptotic proteins. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that Mo treatment at a dose of 7.5 mg/L can ameliorate busulfan-induced infertility in female mice. These data may provide a reference for the development of treatments for female infertility.",

      "abstract": "The effect and regulatory mechanisms of molybdenum compounds (MoO2, MoS2, MoSe2 and MoSi2) on denitrification were investigated by structure-activity relationships, electrochemical characteristics, microbial metabolism analysis and bacterial community distribution. All the assessed molybdenum compounds exhibited the enhancement effect on denitrification, in the order of MoS2 > MoSi2 > MoSe2 > MoO2, with MoS2 increasing 7.08-fold in 12 h. Analysis of structure-activity relationships suggested that the molybdenum compounds with lower negative redox potential and higher redox reversibility were favorable for promoting denitrification. According to the morphology observation, the interactions between Mo compounds and denitrifying bacteria may be beneficial to extracellular electron transfer. Molybdenum compounds with electron transfer capability facilitated an increase in electron capacitance from 835.1 to 1011.3 μF, promoting the electron exchange rate during denitrification. In the denitrification electron transport chain, the molybdenum compounds upregulated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and denitrifying enzyme activity, as well as facilitated the abundance of quinone pools, ATP translocation, and cytochrome c related proteins. Moreover, Mo compounds enriched functional bacteria such as electroactive bacteria and denitrifying functional bacteria. Notably, Mo ions in molybdenum compounds may provide active sites for nitrate reductase, optimizing the electron distribution of the denitrification process and thus improved the partial denitrification efficiency. This work aimed to further understand the regulatory mechanisms of molybdenum on denitrification electron transfer in the compound state and to anticipate the catalytic role of Mo compounds for sustainable water treatment.",

      "abstract": "ConspectusTwo-dimensional (2D) semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), in particular molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), have recently attracted huge interest due to their proper bandgap, high mobility at 2D limit, and easy-to-integrate planar structure, which are very promising for extending Moore's law in postsilicon electronics technology. Great effort has been devoted toward such a goal since the demonstration of protype MoS2 devices with high room-temperature on/off current ratios, ultralow standby power consumption, and atomic level scaling capacity down to sub-1-nm technology node. However, there are still several key challenges that need to be addressed prior to the real application of MoS2-based electronics technology. The controllable growth of wafer-scale single-crystal MoS2 on industry-compatible insulating substrates is the prerequisite of application while the currently synthesized MoS2 films mostly are polycrystalline with limited sizes of single-crystal domains and may involve metal substrates. The precise layer-control is also very important for MoS2 growth since its electronic properties are layer-dependent, whereas the layer-by-layer growth of multilayer MoS2 dominated by the van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy leads to poor thickness uniformity and noncontinuously distributed domains. High density up to 1013 cm-2 of sulfur vacancies (SVs) in grown MoS2 can cause unfavorable carrier scatting and electronic properties variations and will inevitably disturb the device performance. The dangling-bond-free surface of MoS2 gives rise to an inherent vdW gap at metal-semiconductor (M-S) contact, which leads to high electrical resistance and poor current-delivery capability at the contact interface and thereby substantially limits the performances of MoS2 devices.In this Account, we briefly review recent experimental and theoretical attempts for addressing the aforementioned challenges and present our own insights from atomistic simulations. We theoretically revealed the vital role of substrate steps for guiding unidirectional nucleation of monolayer MoS2 and uniform nucleation and edge-aligned growth of bilayer MoS2 by advanced simulations. The established thermodynamic mechanisms have successfully directed the experimental works on the controllable growth of 2 in. single-crystal monolayer and centimeter-scale uniform bilayer MoS2. The postgrowth repair mechanism of SV defect in MoS2 via thiol chemistry treatment has been theoretically explored with the consideration of side reaction of surface functionalization to help experimentally reduce SV defect density by 75%. Beyond the atomic level understanding, theoretical simulations proposed the electronic states hybridization mechanism across the semimetal-MoS2 vdW interface, thereby guiding experimental effort for realizing Ohmic contact at the MoS2-Sb(0112) vdW interface with record-low contact resistance.These advances provide a sound basis with an atomic-level understanding for addressing the related issues. However, there are still notable gaps in terms of system size and time scale of dynamics between atomistic simulations and experimental observations for the studies of MoS2 growth and interfaces. The combination of multiscale simulations and artificial intelligence technology is expected to narrow these gaps and provide a more insightful understanding of the controllable growth and interfacial properties modulation of MoS2. We conclude the Account with the standing challenges and outlook on future research directions from the theoretical perspective."

Herein, we present a mild oxidation valence-engineering strategy to modulate the valence states of Mo in Pluronic F127-coated MoO3-x nanozymes (denoted as MF-x, x: oxidation time) in a controlled manner aiming to improve their specificity of H2O2-associated catalytic reactions for specific therapy and monitoring of ROS-related diseases. Experimentally, MF-0 (Mo average valence 4.64) and MF-10 (Mo average valence 5.68) exhibit exclusively optimal catalase (CAT)- or peroxidase (POD)-like activity, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify the most favorable reaction path for both MF-0- and MF-10-catalyzed reaction processes based on free energy diagram and electronic structure analysis, disclosing the mechanism of the H2O2 activation pathway on the Mo-based nanozymes. Furthermore, MF-0 poses a strong potential in acute kidney injury (AKI) treatment, achieving excellent therapeutic outcomes in vitro and in vivo. Notably, the ROS-responsive photoacoustic imaging (PAI) signal of MF-0 during treatment guarantees real-time monitoring of the therapeutic effect and post-cure assessment in vivo, providing a highly desirable non-invasive diagnostic approach for ROS-related diseases.",

Recently, the appropriate design of materials with intrinsic therapeutic functionalities has garnered enormous interest in the development of various intelligent therapeutic nanoplatforms. In this study, we demonstrate the fabrication of transition metal (molybdenum, Mo)-doped manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoarchitectures, exhibiting diagnostic (magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) and therapeutic (chemodynamic therapy, CDT) functionalities. The facile hydrothermal approach-assisted Mo-doped MnO2 flower-like nanostructures offered tailorable morphologies in altered dimensions, precise therapeutic effects, exceptional biocompatibility, and biodegradability in the tumor microenvironment. The resultant defects due to doped Mo species exhibited peroxidase and oxidase activities, improving glutathione (GSH) oxidation. The two sets of variable valence metal ion pairs (Mn2+/Mn4+ and Mo5+/Mo6+) and their interplay could substantially improve the Fenton-like reaction and generate toxic hydroxyl radicals (•OH), thus achieving CDT-assisted antitumor effects. As inherent T1-MRI agents, these MnO2 nanoparticles displayed excellent MRI efficacy in vitro. Together, we believe that these conformational Mo-doped MnO2 nanoarchitectures with two pairs of variable valence states could potentiate drugless therapy in pharmaceutics.",

      "abstract": "Point defects are thermodynamically stabilized in all crystalline materials, with increased densities negatively impacting the properties and performance of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). While recent point defect reduction methods have led to considerable improvements in the optoelectronic properties of TMDs, there is a clear need for theoretical work to establish the lower limit of defect densities, as represented by thermal equilibrium. To that end, an ab initio and thermodynamic analysis of the equilibrium densities of intrinsic point defects in MoSe2 and WSe2 is presented. The intrinsic defect formation energies at the limits of the selenium and metal-rich regimes are determined by density functional theory (DFT) and then augmented with elemental chemical potential functions to determine temperature- and pressure-dependent formation energies. Equilibrium defect densities are determined for MSe, SeM, vM, and vSe, where M and v, respectively, represent the metal and the vacancy, as a function of synthesis temperature and pressure. The effects of vibrational free energy contributions and treatment of the DFT exchange-correlation potential are found to be non-negligible. Calculated equilibrium densities are several orders of magnitude below reported defect densities in TMDs made by chemical vapor deposition, chemical vapor transport, and flux methods, thereby establishing that current synthesis methods are either kinetically limited or impurity dominated."

The gold standard of treatment is the implantation of a permanent stent implant that is often associated with complications such as thrombus formation, vascular neointimal response, and stent fracture, which altogether decrease the long-term safety and efficacy of the stent. Biodegradable metallic materials have become an attractive alternative because of the ability to facilitate a more physiological healing response while the metal degrades. Recently, Molybdenum (Mo) has been considered as a potential candidate due to its excellent mechanical and medical imaging properties. Moreover, the biomedical research studies performed to date have shown minimal adverse effects in vitro and in vivo. However, there are still concerns of toxicity at high doses, and the impact of the biochemical mechanisms of Mo on material performance especially in pathophysiological environments are yet to be explored. Mo is an essential co factor for enzymes such as xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) that plays a critical role in vascular homeostasis and ACD progression. Herein, this review will focus on the biochemistry of Mo, its physiological and pathological effects with an emphasis on cardiovascular disease as well as the recent studies on Mo for cardiovascular applications and its advantages over other biodegradable metals. The limitations of Mo research studies will also be discussed and concluded with an outlook to move this revolutionary metallic biomaterial from the bench to the bedside."

      "abstract": "MoS2/Ti3C2 MXene composite has emerged as a promising anode material for lithium storage due to the synergistic combination of high specific capacity offered by MoS2 and conductive skeleton provided by Ti3C2 MXene. However, its two-dimensional/two-dimensional (2D/2D) structure is susceptible to collapse after long cycles, while the inherent low conductivity of MoS2 limits its rate performance. In this study, we developed a novel approach combining plasma-induced phase engineering with dual skeleton structure design to fabricate a unique P-MoS2/Ti3C2/CNTs anode material featuring highly conductive 1T phase MoS2 and a stable one-dimensional/two-dimensional (1D/2D) architecture. Within this architecture, growth of MoS2 nanosheets on the surface of Ti3C2 cross-linked by carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was achieved. The resulting Ti3C2/CNTs dual skeleton not only provides robust mechanical support to prevent structural collapse during long cycles but also offers increased specific surface area and additional Li+ storage space, thereby enhancing the lithium storage capacity of the composite. Subsequent N2 plasma treatment induced a phase transition in MoS2 from 2H to 1T configuration. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that the induced 1T-MoS2 exhibits higher conductivity and lower Li+ diffusion barrier compared to 2H-MoS2. Benefiting from these synergistic effects, our P-MoS2/Ti3C2/CNTs anode demonstrated remarkable electrochemical performance including a high reversible specific capacity of 1120 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, excellent cycling stability with a specific capacity retention of 670 mAh g-1 after 600 cycles at 1 A/g, and superior rate performance with a specific capacity of 614 mAh g-1 at 2 A g-1. This combined modification strategy will serve as guidance for designing other energy storage materials."

Furthermore, the optimised Mo0.8W0.2Se2 nanoflakes surface was modified with chitosan (CHI) for improved biocompatibility and nanocatalytic efficacy, then the obtained CHI-Mo0.8W0.2Se2 subsequently loaded the chemotherapeutic drug mitoxantrone (MTO) for enhanced 4 T1 cells killing ability, shortly denoted as CHI-Mo0.8W0.2Se2-MTO for PTT-augmented CDT and chemotherapy (CT). A series of performance validations successfully showed that electrons tend to transfer from W to Mo in CHI-Mo0.8W0.2Se2, which resulted in superior POD-like activity (Km = 0.038 mM) of CHI-Mo0.8W0.2Se2 compared with that of horseradish peroxidase. Furthermore, CHI-Mo0.8W0.2Se2-MTO with excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE=63.2 %) in the near-infrared (NIR) region could further promote endogenous •OH generation and MTO controlled release within solid tumours. In vivo studies confirmed the successful achievement of synergistic therapeutic effects (tumour inhibition rate of over 90 %) with minimised side effects.

Thus, boosting mitochondrial biogenesis has been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach for these diseases; however, currently we have a limited arsenal of compounds that can stimulate mitochondrial function. In this study, we designed molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanoflowers with predefined atomic vacancies that are fabricated by self-assembly of individual two-dimensional MoS2 nanosheets. Treatment of mammalian cells with MoS2 nanoflowers increased mitochondrial biogenesis by induction of PGC-1α and TFAM, which resulted in increased mitochondrial DNA copy number, enhanced expression of nuclear and mitochondrial-DNA encoded genes, and increased levels of mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins. Consistent with increased mitochondrial biogenesis, treatment with MoS2 nanoflowers enhanced mitochondrial respiratory capacity and adenosine triphosphate production in multiple mammalian cell types. Taken together, this study reveals that predefined atomic vacancies in MoS2 nanoflowers stimulate mitochondrial function by upregulating the expression of genes required for mitochondrial biogenesis.",

MoS2-CS NPs exhibited significant antibacterial efficacy against RM1021, and the closest relatives to Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), Erwinia carotovora, and Xanthomonas citri achieved survival rates of 7.40 % ± 1.74 %, 8.94 % ± 1.40 %, and 6.41 % ± 0.56 %, respectively. In vivo results showed, CLas survival rate of 10.42 % ± 3.51 %. Furthermore, treatment with MoS2-CS NPs resulted in an increase in chlorophyll and carotenoid content. Concomitantly, a significant reduction in malondialdehyde (MDA), soluble sugar, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and starch contents was also observed. Mechanistically, MoS2-CS NPs enhanced the activity of antioxidant-related enzymes by upregulating the expression of antioxidant genes, thereby galvanizing the antioxidant system to alleviate oxidative stress.

      "abstract": "In order to improve the dispersion of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and enhance the performance of MoS2, two alginate-derived biomass carbon-MoS2 (BC-MoS2) composites: CMB/CMS, were prepared by introducing BC during the synthesis of MoS2 by hydrothermal. The effects of different gels, times and temperatures of the synthesized BC-MoS2 were investigated, and the adsorption capacity for methylene blue (MB), basic fuchsin (BF) and copper ions (Cu2+) was tested. The results indicated that the vertical growth of MoS2 on the BC surface could be realized when using xero-gel, while the BC and MoS2 were mixed uniformly when using wet-gel. Compared with MoS2, the hydrophilicity and water dispersibility of BC-MoS2 were greatly improved, and BC-MoS2 had better adsorption capacity for MB/BF/Cu2+ (99.61/86.83/60 mg/g). The adsorption mechanism exhibits that the adsorption force of BC-MoS2 on MB/BF is mainly based on the electrostatic force, and the adsorption on Cu2+ comes from the electrostatic force and the Lewis soft-soft interaction. This study dramatically enriches the application of transition metal chalcogenides and provides a meaningful reference for wastewater treatment.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to develop a nanocomposite formulation comprising umbelliferone (UMB) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets as a carrier, termed as the UMB-MoS2 nanocomposite in gel for topical delivery. MoS2 nanosheets were successfully synthesized via a green-hydrothermal reaction of 10 mg of ammonium molybdate and 10 mg of thiourea in 80 mL of deionized water under predetermined conditions. The UMB-MoS2 nanocomposite was prepared by sonicating UMB and MoS2 nanosheets (each of 1 mg/mL) in dimethylformamide. Scanning electron microscopy revealed crumpled nanosheets with an open-ended structure and a nanocomposite as a layered structure. The X-ray diffraction pattern revealed the amorphous nature of UMB in the UMB-MoS2 nanocomposite. Fourier-transform infrared spectra of the UMB-MoS2 nanocomposite had modified bands of the functional group, which confirmed the formation of the nanocomposite. The size and polydispersity-index (435 nm and 0.415, respectively) of the nanocomposite were within the limit for an efficient topical application. Carbopol 934 (2%) was used to prepare the UMB-MoS2 nanocomposite gel (F1) and UMB-Carbopol gel (F2, for comparative evaluation). The pH, spreadability, and viscosity of F1 were found to be 5.56, 5.89 g·cm/s, and 32.5 Pa-sec, respectively, which were optimal for the topical application of gel-based formulations. In vitro release characteristics of both formulations were deemed to be suitable for topical application, where F1 exhibited a biphasic drug release profile and a superior release rate of 94.8% compared to 43.5% for F2 at 24 h. In the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema model, the animal group treated with F1 demonstrated the lowest increase in paw thickness of 26.6%, which was significantly lower as compared to the F2-treated group (52.9%) and the diclofenac sodium-treated group (32.2%). Similarly, in the tail immersion method, F1 exhibited the highest peak tail withdrawal latency of 10.9 s, significantly greater than F2 (8.9 s) and standard treatment (10 s), indicating the superior analgesic activity of F1. This pioneering work introduces a novel UMB-MoS2 nanocomposite with promising anti-inflammatory and analgesic potentials, paving the way for further research into the biomedical applications of MoS2-based nanocarriers."

      "abstract": "The severity of soil molybdenum (Mo) pollution is increasing, and effective management of contaminated soil is essential for the sustainable development of soil. To investigate this, a pot experiment was carried out to assess the impact of different rates of humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA) on the mobility of Mo in soil solution and its uptake by alfalfa, wheat and green bristlegrass. The concentration of Mo in Plants and soil was determined using an Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. The findings revealed that the application of HA led to an increase in Mo accumulation in the shoot and root of green bristlegrass and wheat, ranging from 10.56 % to 28.73 % and 62.15-115.79 % (shoot), and 17.52-46.53 % and 6.29-81.25 % (root), respectively. Nonetheless, the use of HA resulted in a slight inhibition of plant Mo uptake, leading to reduced Mo accumulation in alfalfa roots compared to the control treatment (from 3284.49 mg/kg to 2140.78-2813.54 mg/kg). On the other hand, the application of FA decreased Mo accumulation in the wheat shoot (from 909.92 mg/kg to 338.54-837.45 mg/kg). Furthermore, the bioavailability of green bristlegrass (with HA) and wheat (with FA) decreased, and the percentage of residual fraction of Mo increased (from 0.39 % to 0.78-0.96 %, from 3.95 % to 3.97∼ 4.34 %). This study aims to elucidate the ternary interaction among Mo, humic substances, and plants (alfalfa, wheat, and green bristlegrass), to enhance both the activation and hyperaccumulation of Mo simultaneously.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that can affect individuals of all ages. Recent research has shown that oxidative stress plays a crucial role in the development of AD. Therefore, inhibiting oxidative stress may be an effective therapeutic approach for AD. Nano-molybdenum is a promising material for use as an antioxidant. We aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effects and preliminary mechanisms of molybdenum nanoparticles (Mo NPs) by using a murine model of chemically induced AD-like disease. METHODS: HaCaT cells, a spontaneously immortalized human keratinocyte cell line, were stimulated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha /interferon-gamma after pre-treatment with Mo NPs. Reactive oxygen species levels, production of inflammatory factors, and activation of the nuclear factor kappa-B and the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor pathways were then evaluated. Mo NPs was topically applied to treat a murine model of AD-like disease induced by MC903, a vitamin D3 analog. Dermatitis scores, pruritus scores, transepidermal water loss and body weight were evaluated. AD-related inflammatory factors and chemokines were evaluated. Activation of the nuclear factor kappa-B and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor / heme oxygenase-1 pathways was assessed. RESULTS: Our data showed that the topical application of Mo NPs dispersion could significantly alleviate AD skin lesions and itching and promote skin barrier repair. Further mechanistic experiments revealed that Mo NPs could inhibit the excessive activation of the nuclear factor kappa-B pathway, promote the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor and heme oxygenase-1 proteins, and suppress oxidative stress reactions. Additionally, they inhibited the expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin, inflammatory factors, and chemokines, thereby alleviating skin inflammation. CONCLUSION: Mo NPs present a promising alternative treatment option for patients with AD as they could address three pivotal mechanisms in the pathogenesis of AD concurrently.",

      "abstract": "Oral mucosal ulcer is the most prevalent oral mucosal lesion, affecting over 25 % of general population. The current treatment regimens lack efficacy in addressing challenges such as wound bleeding, bacterial infection and inflammation on a continuous basis. Hence, a multi-functional oral gel (termed MPCST) with a long-acting duration is designed. It is based on a tannic acid-thioctic acid (TATA) supramolecular hydrogel which absorbs tissue exudate while exhibiting robust tissue adhesion properties. To form MPCST, TATA is loaded with MPCS, which are composed of polydopamine (PDA)-coated molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanoflakes (MoS2@PDA) with high photothermal conversion efficiency, nitric oxide (NO) precursor nitroprusside (SNP) and cerium oxide (CeO2) with high reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging rate. Upon exposure to 808 nm near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, MPCS rapidly heats up and releases NO to promote angiogenesis, while exhibiting strong ROS scavenging, antibacterial (including oral common Streptococcus mutans), and anti-inflammatory properties. Animal experiments show that the MPCST oral gel, composed of MPCS and TATA hydrogel, exhibits superior therapeutic efficacy compared to the commonly used dexamethasone patch.",

This review aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of the latest developments in 2D MoS2 cancer theranostics and emerging strategies in this field. This review highlights the potential applications of 2D MoS2 in single-model imaging and therapy, including fluorescence imaging, photoacoustic imaging, photothermal therapy, and catalytic therapy. This review further classifies the potential of 2D MoS2 in multimodal imaging for diagnostic and synergistic theranostic platforms. In particular, this review underscores the progress of 2D MoS2 as an integrated drug delivery system, covering a broad spectrum of therapeutic strategies from chemotherapy and gene therapy to immunotherapy and photodynamic therapy. Finally, this review discusses the current challenges and future perspectives in meeting the diverse demands of advanced cancer diagnostic and theranostic applications.",

Its altered level in the serum has been implicated in human health and diseases such as colorectal cancer, chronic kidney diseases, cardiovascular diseases, etc. Early detection of TMAO in body fluids has been presumed to be significant in understanding the pathogenesis and treatment of many diseases. Hence, developing reliable and rapid technologies for its detection may augment our understanding of pathogenesis and diagnosis of diseases. Hence, in the present work, polypyrrole (Ppy)@molybdenum(III)sulfide (Mo2S3) nanosheets (NS) composite molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) (Ppy@Mo2S3-MIP) based electrochemical sensor has been fabricated for the detection of TMAO. Polypyrrole (Ppy) and Mo2S3 NS have been synthesized by chemical oxidative polymerization and hydrothermal techniques, respectively. The synthesized nanocomposite has been validated using different techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The fabricated Ppy@Mo2S3-MIP sensor showed a linear detection range from 30 µM to 210 µM, a sensitivity of 1.21 μA μM-1 cm-2 and a limit of detection as 1.4 μM for the detection of TMAO and found more robust and improved when compared with Ppy-MIP using identical parameters. The fabricated sensor is also highly selective towards TMAO. It can be further used to detect TMAO in human samples such as urine quickly.",

To improve the activity at a low loading density, two molybdenum sulfide clusters, [Mo3S4]4+ and [Mo3S13]2-, were investigated. The Mo3S x molecular catalysts were heterogenized on Sb2Se3 with a simple soaking treatment, resulting in a thin catalyst layer of only a few nanometers that gave up to 20 mA cm-2 under one sun illumination. Both [Mo3S4]4+ and [Mo3S13]2- exhibit catalytic activities on Sb2Se3, with [Mo3S13]2- emerging as the superior catalyst, demonstrating enhanced photovoltage and an average faradaic efficiency of 100% for hydrogen evolution. This superiority is attributed to the effective loading and higher catalytic activity of [Mo3S13]2- on the Sb2Se3 surface, validated by X-ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopy."

Electrical stimulation represents an effective and non-pharmacological treatment to promote nerve regeneration. Yet, the postoperative application of electrical stimulation remains a challenge. Here, we propose a fully biodegradable, self-powered nerve guidance conduit (NGC) based on dissolvable zinc-molybdenum batteries. The conduit can offer topographic guidance for nerve regeneration and deliver sustained electrical cues between both ends of a transected nerve stump, extending beyond the surgical window. Schwann cell proliferation and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production are enhanced by the introduction of the zinc-molybdenum batteries. In rodent models with 10-mm sciatic nerve damage, the device effectively enhances nerve regeneration and motor function recovery.

Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each imaging technique, and their combined diagnosis was evaluated using the four-table method. Consistency between the imaging techniques and pathological examination was assessed using the consistency checking method. Additionally, changes in imaging indicators were compared among patients with different prognostic indicators. RESULTS: Among the 128 patients, 86 were diagnosed with TNBC through pathological examination. The sensitivity and specificity of 3.0T MRI for TNBC were 82.56% and 76.19%, respectively. Molybdenum target X-ray exhibited a sensitivity of 77.91% and specificity of 78.57%. The combined diagnosis of the two techniques showed a sensitivity of 90.70% and specificity of 86.36%. There was good agreement between both imaging techniques and pathological examination results. Significant differences were observed in imaging indicators based on tumor diameter, histological grade, and lymph node metastasis. CONCLUSION: Both 3.0T MRI and molybdenum target X-ray are valuable in diagnosing TNBC. Additionally, these imaging techniques provide prognostic information and can aid in treatment decision-making. The findings highlight the importance of 3.0T MRI and molybdenum target X-ray in improving the outcomes of patients with TNBC."

      "abstract": "Molybdenum (Mo) is a crucial microelement for both, humans and plants. The use of agronomic biofortification techniques can be an alternative method to enhance Mo content in vegetables. Concomitantly, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) application is a valuable strategy to enhance plant performances and overcome plant abiotic distresses such as microelement overdose. The aim of this research was to estimate the direct and/or indirect effects of Mo supply at four doses [0.0, 0.5 (standard dose), 2.0 or 4.0 μmol L-1], alone or combined with AMF inoculation, on plant performances. In particular, plant height and first flower truss emission, productive features (total yield, marketable yield and average marketable fruit weight) and fruit qualitative characteristics (fruit dry matter, soluble solids content, titratable acidity, ascorbic acid, lycopene, polyphenol, nitrogen, copper, iron and molybdenum) of an established cherry tomato genotype cultivated in soilless conditions were investigated. Moreover, proline and malondialdehyde concentrations, as well as Mo hazard quotient (HQ) in response to experimental treatments were determined. A split-plot randomized experimental block design with Mo dosages as plots and +AMF or -AMF as sub-plots was adopted. Data revealed that AMF inoculation enhanced marketable yield (+50.0 %), as well as some qualitative traits, such as fruit soluble solids content (SSC) (+9.9 %), ascorbic acid (+7.3 %), polyphenols (+2.3 %), and lycopene (+2.5 %). Molybdenum application significantly increased SSC, polyphenols, fruit Mo concentration (+29.0 % and +100.0 % in plants biofortified with 2.0 and 4.0 μmol Mo L-1 compared to those fertigated with the standard dose, respectively) and proline, whereas it decreased N (-25.0 % and -41.6 % in plants biofortified with 2.0 and 4.0 μmol Mo L-1 compared to those fertigated with the standard dose, respectively). Interestingly, the application of AMF mitigated the detrimental effect of high Mo dosages (2.0 or 4.0 μmol L-1). A pronounced advance in terms of plant height 45 DAT, fruit lycopene concentration and fruit Fe, Cu and Mo concentrations was observed when AMF treatment and Mo dosages (2.0 or 4.0 μmol Mo L-1) were combined. Plants inoculated or not with AMF showed an improvement in the hazard quotient (HQ) in reaction to Mo application. However, the HQ - for a consumption of 200 g day-1 of biofortified cherry tomato - remained within the safety level for human consumption. This study suggests that Mo-implementation (at 2.0 or 4.0 μmol L-1) combined with AMF inoculation could represent a viable cultivation protocol to enhance yield, produce premium quality tomato fruits and, concomitantly, improve Mo dose in human diet. In the light of our findings, further studies on the interaction between AMF and microelements in other vegetable crops are recommended."

However, the acidic environment of the stomach and H. pylori resistance severely impair the antimicrobial efficacy of oral drugs. Here, a biocompatible chitosan-modified molybdenum selenide (MoSe2@CS) was designed for the simultaneous photothermal treatment of H. pylori infection and gastric cancer. MoSe2@CS showed a photothermal conversion efficiency was as high as 45.7 %. In the H. pylori-infected mice model, MoSe2@CS displayed a high bacteriostasis ratio of 99.9 % upon near-infrared irradiation. The antimicrobial functionality was also proved by transcriptomic sequencing study, which showed that MoSe2@CS combined with NIR laser irradiation modulated the gene expression of a variety of H. pylori bioprocesses, including cell proliferation and inflammation-related pathways. Further gut flora analysis results indicated that MoSe2@CS mediated PTT of H. pylori did not affect the homeostasis of gut flora, which highlights its advantages over traditional antibiotic therapy. In addition, MoSe2@CS exhibited a good photothermal ablation effect and significantly inhibited gastric tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. The comprehensive application of MoSe2@CS in the PTT of H. pylori infection and gastric cancer provides a new avenue for the clinical treatment of H. pylori infection and related diseases.",

Taking eleven tailing samples collected at the main molybdenum tailings ponds in Shaanxi Province as the research object, the physical, chemical, and mineralogical characteristics were studied through scanning electron microscope, X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer, and others. The ecological risk and utilization potential of molybdenum tailings were investigated through leaching test, geo-accumulation index, potential ecological risk assessment, and other methods. The results demonstrated that the main chemical and mineralogical composition of various molybdenum tailings in Shaanxi Province is similar, and the predominant mineral composition is muscovite, quartz, microcline, and calcite. The potential ecological risk of heavy metals in six molybdenum tailings is high, while Pb and Cd are the main pollution risk elements. Molybdenum tailings contain considerable amounts of critical minerals with huge potential economic value, and molybdenum tailings with high environmental hazards could be converted into a possible source for critical minerals by recovering the critical minerals and repurposing the secondary tailings as an additive or cement substitute. This study provides an innovative idea for the pollution treatment of molybdenum tailings and indicates the prospect of molybdenum tailings as a secondary source for critical minerals.",

      "abstract": "The issue of bacterial infectious diseases remains a significant concern worldwide, particularly due to the misuse of antibiotics, which has caused the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains. Fortunately, the rapid development of nanomaterials has propelled significant progress in antimicrobial therapy, offering promising solutions. Among them, the utilization of nanoenzyme-based chemodynamic therapy (CDT) has become a highly hopeful approach to combating bacterial infectious diseases. Nevertheless, the application of CDT appears to be facing certain constraints for its low efficiency in the Fenton reaction at the infected site. In this study, we have successfully synthesized a versatile nanozyme, which was a composite of molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) and iron sulfide (FeS2), through the hydrothermal method. The results showed that iron/molybdenum sulfide nanozymes (Fe/Mo SNZs) with desirable peroxidase (POD) mimic activity can generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) by successfully triggering the Fenton reaction. The presence of MoS2 significantly accelerates the conversion of Fe2+/Fe3+ through a cocatalytic reaction that involves the participation of redox pairs of Mo4+/Mo6+, thereby enhancing the efficiency of CDT. Additionally, based on the excellent photothermal performance of Fe/Mo SNZs, a near-infrared (NIR) laser was used to induce localized temperature elevation for photothermal therapy (PTT) and enhance the POD-like nanoenzymatic activity. Notably, both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated that Fe/Mo SNZs with good broad-spectrum antibacterial properties can help eradicate Gram-negative bacteria like Escherichia coli and Gram-positive bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus. The most exciting thing is that the synergistic PTT/CDT exhibited astonishing antibacterial ability and can achieve complete elimination of bacteria, which promoted wound healing after infection. Overall, this study presents a synergistic PTT/CDT strategy to address antibiotic resistance, providing avenues and directions for enhancing the efficacy of wound healing treatments and offering promising prospects for further clinical use in the near future.",

Non-traditional carbon materials like graphene nanoplatelets and graphite oxide used as the carbonaceous component of the composite can contribute to its affordability and/or functionality. Ti(1-x)MoxO2-C composites involving these carbon materials were prepared through a sol-gel route; the effect of the extension of the procedure through a solvothermal treatment step was assessed. Both supports and supported Pt catalysts were characterized by physicochemical methods. Electrochemical behavior of the catalysts in terms of stability, activity, and CO tolerance was studied. Solvothermal treatment decreased the fracture of graphite oxide plates and enhanced the formation of a reduced graphene oxide-like structure, resulting in an electrically more conductive and more stable catalyst. In parallel, solvothermal treatment enhanced the growth of mixed oxide crystallites, decreasing the chance of formation of Pt-oxide-carbon triple junctions, resulting in somewhat less CO tolerance. The electrocatalyst containing graphene nanoplatelets, along with good stability, has the highest activity in oxygen reduction reaction compared to the other composite-supported catalysts."

      "abstract": "Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) quantum dots (QDs) based therapeutic approaches hold great promise for biomedical applications, necessitating a thorough evaluation of their potential effects on biological systems. In this study, we systematically investigated the impact of MoS2 QDs coated with 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[amino(polyethyleneglycol)-2000](DPSE-PEG) linked with (3-carboxypropyl)triphenyl-phosphonium-bromide (TPP) on molecular structures of hepatic tissue lipids and proteins through a multifaceted analysis. The DSPE-PEG-TPP-MoS2 QDs were prepared and administered to the mice daily for 7 weeks. Liver tissues were subjected to a comprehensive examination using various techniques, including Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy, and liver function tests. FTIR revealed subtle changes in the lipid composition of liver tissues, indicating potential modifications in the cell membrane structure. Also, the (CH stretching and amides I and II regions) analysis unveiled tiny alterations in lipid chain length and fluidity without changes in the protein structures, suggesting a minor influence of DSPE-PEG-TPP-MoS2 QDs on the liver's cellular membrane and no effect on the protein structures. Further scrutiny using UV-vis spectroscopy demonstrated that DSPE-PEG-TPP-MoS2 QDs had no discernible impact on the absorbance intensities of aromatic amino acids and the Soret band. This observation implies that the treatment with SPE-PEG-TPP-MoS2 QDs did not induce significant alterations in helical conformation or the microenvironment surrounding prosthetic groups in liver tissues. The liver function tests, including ALP, ALT, AST, and BIL levels, revealed no statistically significant changes in these key biomarkers despite minor fluctuations in their values, indicating a lack of significant liver dysfunction. This study provides a detailed understanding of the effects of DSPE-PEG-TPP-MoS2 QDs on hepatic lipids and proteins, offering valuable insights into the biocompatibility and limited impact on the molecular and functional aspects of the liver tissue. These findings could be essential for the application of MoS2 QDs-based therapies.",

      "abstract": "Chronic refractory wounds caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial and biofilm infections are a substantial threat to human health, which presents a persistent challenge in managing clinical wound care. We here synthesized a composite nanosheet AIPH/AMP/MoS2, which can potentially be used for combined therapy because of the photothermal effect induced by MoS2, its ability to deliver antimicrobial peptides, and its ability to generate alkyl free radicals independent of oxygen. The synthesized nanosheets exhibited 61 % near-infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion efficiency, marked photothermal stability and free radical generating ability. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the composite nanosheets against MDR Escherichia coli (MDR E. coli) and MDR Staphylococcus aureus (MDR S. aureus) were approximately 38 μg/mL and 30 μg/mL, respectively. The composite nanosheets (150 μg/mL) effectively ablated >85 % of the bacterial biofilm under 808-nm NIR irradiation for 6 min. In the wound model experiment, approximately 90 % of the wound healed after the 4-day treatment with the composite nanosheets. The hemolysis experiment, mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEFs) cytotoxicity experiment, and mouse wound healing experiment all unveiled the excellent biocompatibility of the composite nanosheets. According to the transcriptome analysis, the composite nanosheets primarily exerted a synergistic therapeutic effect by disrupting the cellular membrane function of S. aureus and inhibiting quorum sensing mediated by the two-component system. Thus, the synthesized composite nanosheets exhibit remarkable antibacterial and biofilm ablation properties and therefore can be used to improve wound healing in chronic biofilm infections.",

Animals were fed a 50:50 hay:grain diet ad libitum twice daily. Daily feed refusals were monitored, and intake was adjusted weekly. Body weights were recorded every 14 days and blood samples were collected on the second week of every month to determine Cu, Mo, Fe, Zn, and other blood metabolites. After 85 days, animals were humanely euthanized and carcass traits were measured. Liver, longissimus muscle area, and kidney samples were collected postmortem. Liver Cu (p < 0.003), blood triacylglycerides (p < 0.03), and serum total protein (p < 0.03) levels were reduced; the liver (p = 0.07) and kidney (p < 0.001) Mo concentrations were increased; and the immune response was decreased linearly (p < 0.01) with additional Mo. Low levels of Cu with increasing Mo levels in the diet did not negatively impact animal performance or blood metabolites, in the duration of this study (85 days); however, it lowered the liver Cu, Fe, and immune responses in goats."

      "abstract": "This study employs plasma-liquid interaction technique to synthesize different phases of molybdenum oxide using air and argon as plasma-forming gases. In situ plasma-generated nitrogen species primarily NO3-/NO2- and hydrogen species (H+) facilitate the reduction of the molybdenum precursor anion (Mo7O24-). The reduced Mo species subsequently reacts with reactive oxygen species, forming MoO6 octahedra, which is the building block of a molybdenum oxide crystal. Varied concentrations of NO3-/NO2- and H+ species in air and argon plasma treatment significantly influence the growth process. Air plasma synthesis yields hexagonal molybdenum oxide microrods, which upon calcination changes its phase to orthorhombic 2D layered structure. Moreover, the argon plasma synthesized sample exhibits a mixed phase of hexagonal and orthorhombic molybdenum oxide due to the heavy argon ion bombardment, inducing material porosity and surface oxygen vacancies. The mixed-phase material exhibits superior adsorption and photo-degradation towards cationic dye compared to the other two phases. The higher photocatalytic performance may be responsible for the extended lifetime of the photo-generated charge carriers possessed by the mixed-phase material. Radical scavenging tests have identified holes and hydroxyl radicals as the key reactive species that take part in the photo-degradation process."

      "abstract": "Plasmonic metal oxides are promising photocatalysts for the artificial photosynthesis of green ammonia due to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) enhanced photoconversion and rich surface oxygen vacancies improved chemisorption and activation of dinitrogen molecules. However, these oxygen vacancies are unstable during the photocatalytic process and could be oxidized by photogenerated holes, leading to the vanishing of the LSPR. Here, we fabricated antimony-doped molybdenum trioxide nanosheets with stable plasmonic absorption extending into the near-infrared (NIR) range, even after harsh treatment in oxidative atmospheric conditions at high temperatures. For undoped plasmonic MoO3-x nanosheets, the LSPR originates from the abundant oxygen vacancies that vanish after heat treatment at high temperatures in air, leading to the disappearance of the LSPR absorption. Sb doping does not significantly increase the concentration of oxygen vacancies while donating more free electrons because Sb can keep a lower oxidation state. Heat treatment diminished the oxygen vacancies while not affecting the low oxidation state of Sb. As a result, heat-treated Sb-doped MoO3-x nanosheets still show strong LSPR absorption in the NIR range. Both experimental results and theoretical calculations demonstrated that add-on states close to the Fermi level are formed due to the Sb doping and high concentration of oxygen vacancies. The prepared samples were used for photocatalytic nitrogen reduction and showed an LSPR-dependent photocatalytic performance. The present work has provided an effective strategy to stabilize the LSPR of plasmonic semiconductor photocatalysts."

      "abstract": "Drug-resistant bacterial infections pose a serious threat to human health; thus, there is an increasingly growing demand for nonantibiotic strategies to overcome drug resistance in bacterial infections. Mild photothermal therapy (PTT), as an attractive antibacterial strategy, shows great potential application due to its good biocompatibility and ability to circumvent drug resistance. However, its efficiency is limited by the heat resistance of bacteria. Herein, Cu2O@MoS2, a nanocomposite, was constructed by the in situ growth of Cu2O nanoparticles (NPs) on the surface of MoS2 nanosheets, which provided a controllable photothermal therapeutic effect of MoS2 and the intrinsic catalytic properties of Cu2O NPs, achieving a synergistic effect to eradicate multidrug-resistant bacteria. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) results revealed that the antibacterial process was related to disrupting the membrane transport system, phosphorelay signal transduction system, oxidative stress response system, as well as the heat response system. Animal experiments indicated that Cu2O@MoS2 could effectively treat wounds infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, satisfactory biocompatibility made Cu2O@MoS2 a promising antibacterial agent. Overall, our results highlight the Cu2O@MoS2 nanocomposite as a promising solution to combating resistant bacteria without inducing the evolution of antimicrobial resistance.",

Herein, ultrathin Mo metallene nanosheets with a thickness of <5 nm prepared by liquid phase exfoliation were explored as functional hyperthermia agents for non-inflammatory ablation of tumors. The obtained Mo metallene nanosheets exhibited good photothermal conversion properties and significant reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging ability, thus achieving superior cancer cell ablation and anti-inflammatory effects in vitro. For in vivo experiments, 4T1 tumors were ablated while the inflammation-related cytokine levels did not obviously increase, demonstrating that the inflammatory response induced by PTT was inhibited by the anti-inflammatory properties of Mo metallene nanosheets. Moreover, Mo metallene nanosheets depicted good dispersibility and biocompatibility, beneficial for biomedical applications.

      "abstract": "There are many heavy metal stresses in agricultural biological systems, especially cadmium (Cd) stress, which prevent the full growth of plants, lead to a serious decline in crop yield, and endanger human health. Molybdenum (Mo), an essential nutrient element for plants, regulates plant growth mainly by reducing the absorption of heavy metals and protecting plants from oxidative damage. The aim of this study was to determine the protective effect of Mo (1 μM) application on wheat plants under conditions of Cd (10 μM) toxicity. The biomass, Cd and Mo contents, photosynthesis, leaf and root ultrastructure, antioxidant system, and active oxygen content of the wheat plants were determined. Mo increased the total chlorophyll content of wheat leaves by 43.02% and the net photosynthetic rate by 38.67%, and ameliorated the inhibitory effect of cadmium on photosynthesis by up-regulating photosynthesis-related genes and light-trapping genes. In addition, Mo reduced the content of superoxide anion (O2•-) by 16.55% and 31.12%, malondialdehyde (MDA) by 20.75% and 7.17%, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by 24.69% and 8.17%, and electrolyte leakage (EL) by 27.59% and 16.82% in wheat leaves and roots, respectively, and enhanced the antioxidant system to reduce the burst of reactive oxygen species and alleviate the damage of Cd stress on wheat. According to the above results, Mo is considered a plant essential nutrient that enhances Cd tolerance in wheat by limiting the absorption, accumulation and transport of Cd and by regulating antioxidant defence mechanisms. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATION: Cadmium (Cd)，is one of the most toxic heavy metals in the environment, and Cd pollution is a global environmental problem that threatens food security and human health. Molybdenum (Mo), as an essential plant nutrient, is often used to resist environmental stress. However, the mechanism of Mo treatment on wheat subjected to Cd stress has not been reported. In this study, we systematically analysed the effects of Mo on the phenotype, physiology, biochemistry, ultrastructure and Cd content of wheat subjected to Cd stress, and comprehensively analysed the transcriptomics. It not only reveals the mechanism of Mo tolerance to Cd stress in wheat, but also provides new insights into phytoremediation and plant growth in Cd-contaminated soil.",

The addition of CGHCL significantly enhances the adsorption performance of MoS2. Furthermore, C-MoS2 exhibits exceedingly high removal efficiency and excellent regenerative capability for Cr (VI)-containing electroplating wastewater. The core-shell structure effectively minimizes molybdenum leaching to the greatest extent, while the oleophobic interface is unaffected by oily substances in water, and the expanded interlayer structure ensures the long-term stability of C-MoS2 in air (90 days).

There is significant variation in survival and in the quality of symptomatic management of affected children. One of the four disorders, molybdenum cofactor deficiency type A (MoCD-A) has recently become amenable to causal treatment with synthetic cPMP (fosdenopterin). The evidence base for the rational use of cPMP is very limited. This prompted the formulation of these clinical guidelines to facilitate diagnosis and support the management of patients. The guidelines were developed by experts in diagnosis and treatment of sulfite intoxication disorders. It reflects expert consensus opinion and evidence from a systematic literature search.",

However, creating secure wound dressings with these therapies faces challenges. The primary focus of this study is to prepare an antibacterial nanofiber dressing that effectively incorporates stable loads of functional nanoparticles and demonstrates an efficient synergistic effect between PTT and PDT. Herein, a composite nanofiber mat was fabricated, integrating spherical molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanoparticles. MoS2 was deposited onto polylactic acid (PLA) nanofiber mats using vacuum filtration, which was further stabilized by sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) adhesion and glutaraldehyde (GA) cross-linking. The composite nanofibers demonstrated synergistic antibacterial effects under NIR light irradiation, and the underlying mechanism was explored. They induce bacterial membrane permeability, protein leakage, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) elevation, ultimately leading to >95 % antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli), which is higher than that of single thermotherapy (almost no antibacterial activity) or ROS therapy (about 80 %). In addition, the composite nanofiber mats exhibited promotion effects on infected wound healing in vivo. This study demonstrates the great prospects of composite nanofiber dressings in clinical treatment of bacterial-infected wounds.",

Anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) has many beneficial properties leading to its wide use across industries as a surface treatment for many aluminum components, but the wear properties of the coating could be improved significantly. Here, we used an electrochemical method to incorporate molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), a nanomaterial used as a dry lubricant, to modify alloys of aluminum during AAO preparation. Using Raman spectroscopy and tribological scratch measurements, we thoroughly characterized the structure and wear behavior of the films. The MoS2 deposition procedure was optimal on aluminum 5052 anodized in higher acid concentrations, with friction coefficients at around 0.05 (~10× better than unmodified AAO). Changing anodization conditions to produce harder films with smaller pores led to worsened wear properties, likely because of lower MoS2 content. Studying a commercial MoS2/AAO film of a different Al alloy (7075) showed that a heat treatment step intended to fully convert all deposited MoSx species to MoS2 can adversely affect wear in some alloys. While Al 6061 and 1100 produced films with worse wear performance compared to Al 5052 or 7075, our results show evidence that acid cleaning after initial anodization likely removes residual alloying elements, affecting MoS2 incorporation. This study demonstrates a nanomaterial modified AAO film with superior wear characteristics to unmodified AAO and relates fabrication procedure, film structure, and practical performance."

It presents with seizures, psychomotor delay, and breastfeeding difficulties. Seizures are especially prominent in patients with MoCD. CASE PRESENTATION: A 3-month-old girl presented with refractory generalized tonic-clonic seizures since the third day of life. Her parents were third-degree relatives. On physical examination, she demonstrated psychomotor delay, breastfeeding difficulties, seizures, doll-like facial features, and other neurological abnormalities. Her brain MRI scan revealed cortical and white matter atrophy of the cerebral hemispheres. Metabolic workup revealed elevated levels of liver enzymes, lactic acid, and ammonia. These results were inconclusive. She received anticonvulsants and vitamin therapy to manage her seizures. Based on a suspicion of mitochondrial disease, genetic analysis was performed, revealing a homozygous variant of uncertain significance in the MOCS1 gene associated with autosomal recessive molybdenum cofactor deficiency type A. CONCLUSION: MoCD is a rare disease. Early diagnosis should be considered based on the patient's medical history and MRI findings, after excluding other possible diagnoses. The definitive diagnosis relies on genetic testing results."

      "abstract": "Cardiac pacing with temporary epicardial pacing wires (TEPW) is used to treat rhythm disturbances after cardiac surgery. Occasionally, TEPW cannot be mechanically extracted and remain in the thorax, where they may rarely cause serious complications like migration and infection. We aim to develop bioresorbable TEPW that will dissolve over time even if postoperative removal is unsuccessful. In the present study, we demonstrate a completely bioresorbable design using molybdenum (Mo) as electric conductor and the resorbable polymers poly(D, L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and polycaprolactone (PCL) for electrically insulating double-coating. We compared the pacing properties of these Mo TEPW demonstrators to conventional steel TEPW in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts and observed similar functionality. In vitro, static immersion tests in simulated body fluid for up to 28 days elucidated the degradation behaviour of uncoated Mo strands and the influence of polymer coating thereon. Degradation was considerably reduced in double-coated Mo TEPW compared to the uncoated and the PLGA-coated condition. Furthermore, we confirmed good biocompatibility of Mo degradation products in the form of low cytotoxicity in cell cultures of human cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Temporary pacing wires are routinely implanted on the heart surface to treat rhythm disturbances in the days following cardiac surgery. Subsequently, these wires are to be removed. When removal attempts are unsuccessful, wires are cut at skin level and the remainders are left inside the chest. Retained fragments may migrate within the body or become a centre of infection. These complications may be prevented using resorbable pacing wires. We manufactured completely resorbable temporary pacing wires using molybdenum as electrical conductor and assessed their function, degradation and biological compatibility. Our study represents an important step in the development of a safer approach to the treatment of rhythm disturbances after cardiac surgery.",

In this context, we prepared a radiosensitizing system using copper-free click chemistry between a Mo6 cluster bearing azido ligands and the homo-bifunctional linker bis-dPEG11-DBCO. The resulting compound formed nanoparticles, which featured production of O2(1Δg) and efficient cellular uptake, leading to remarkable photo- and radiotoxic effects against the prostatic adenocarcinoma TRAMP-C2 cell line. Spheroids of TRAMP-C2 cells were also used for evaluation of toxicity and phototoxicity. In vivo experiments on a mouse model demonstrated that subcutaneous injection of the nanoparticles is a safe administration mode at a dose of up to 0.08 g kg-1.

With the growing utilization of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets in water treatment and purification processes, it is crucial to evaluate the stability of MoS2 nanosheets in aquatic environments. Nonetheless, the effects of anionic species on MoS2 remain largely unexplored. Herein, the stability of chemically exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets (ceMoS2) was assessed in the presence of inorganic anions. The results showed that the chemical stability of ceMoS2 was regulated by the nucleophilicities and the resultant charging effects of the anions in aquatic systems. The anions promote the dissolution of ceMoS2 by triggering a shift in the chemical potential of the ceMoS2 surface as a function of the anion nucleophilicity (i.e., charging effect). Fast charging with HCO3- and HPO42-/H2PO4- was validated by a phase transition from 1T to 2H and the emergence of MoV, and it promoted oxidative dissolution of the ceMoS2. Additionally, under sunlight, ceMoS2 dissolution was accelerated by NO3-. These findings provide insight into the ion-induced fate of ceMoS2 and the durability and risks of MoS2 nanosheets in environmental applications.",

However, this interaction was first observed in ruminants, and they convert molybdate (MoO4 2- ) into tetrathiomolybdate (MoS4 2- ; TTM), reacting with cellular Cu to yield biological unavailable Mo/S/Cu cluster, then developing Cu-deficiency diseases. These findings inspire the use of TTM as a Cu-sequester drug, especially for treating Cu-dependent human diseases such as Wilson diseases (WD) and cancer. It is well known that a balanced Cu homeostasis is essential for a wide range of biological processes, but negative consequence leads to cell toxicity. Therefore, this review aims to connect the Mo-Cu antagonism in metalloproteins and anti-copper therapy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hair loss is a common dermatological condition including various types such as alopecia areata, androgenetic alopecia, etc. Minoxidil is a topical medication used for treating hair loss, which is effective for various types of alopecia. However, minoxidil has limitations in treating hair loss, such as slow onset of action and low efficacy, and it cannot effectively inhibit one of the major pathogenic factors of hair loss - excessive oxidative stress. METHODS: Transition metal elements with rapid electron transfer, such as molybdenum, have been extensively studied and applied for inhibiting oxidative stress. We established a mouse model for hair growth and intervened with nano-sized molybdenum, minoxidil, and a combination of both. The physicochemical properties of nano-sized molybdenum enabled it to mediate oxidative stress more quickly. RESULTS: The results showed that nano-sized molybdenum can accelerate hair growth, increase the number of local hair follicles, and reduce the expression of oxidative stress-related molecules such as iNOS, COX2, and androgen receptors. The combination of nano-sized molybdenum and minoxidil showed an additive effect in promoting hair growth. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that nano-sized molybdenum might be a potential topical medication for treating hair loss by inhibiting the oxidative stress pathway. Nano-sized molybdenum, alone or in combination with minoxidil, could be a promising therapeutic approach for patients with hair loss, particularly those who do not respond well to current treatments. Further clinical studies are warranted to confirm the efficacy and safety of this novel treatment.",

Cancer is a prevalent disease that severely threatens human life and health. Thus, innovative and effective therapeutic approaches are urgently required for cancer. Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a promising approach to killing cancer cells. In this investigation, we developed a low-cost, simple, green technique to fabricate molybdenum trioxide nanostructures (MNs) using Opuntia ficus-indica mucilage as a template. Moreover, the MNs were functionalized with folic acid (FA) for cancer PTT. The X-ray diffractometer results revealed that the prepared MNs have an orthorhombic crystal phase. The transmission electron microscope image of MNs shows a flake shape with 20-150 nm diameter. The cytotoxicity of MNs and FA-conjugated MNs was studied in vitro. These cell viability assay results suggested that fabricated MoO3 nanostructures reduced 25% of cell viability in MCF-7 cells, even at high doses. However, even with high-dose treatment, FA/MNs do not cause significant cell death. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining revealed DNA and chromatin condensation in MCF-7 cells exposed to MNs. Overall, the in vitro study results suggested that FA/MNs have excellent biocompatibility, which applies to biomedical applications. MNs dispersion temperature gradually increases from 26 to 58°C under 808 nm laser irradiation. We found significant mortality rates after NIR irradiation in MNs- or FA/MNs-treated MCF-7 cells. These findings suggest that FA/MNs can be used as an effective photothermal agent to treat breast cancer.",

The prepared PB/Fe3O4/MoS2 nanocomposites adsorbent displayed excellent fast magnetic separation and adsorption capacity of Cs+ (Qm = 80.51 mg/g) from water. The adsorption behavior of Cs+ by PB/Fe3O4/MoS2 conformed to Langmuir isothermal and second-order kinetic model, which belonged to chemical adsorption and endothermic reaction. The equilibrium adsorption capacity of PB/Fe3O4/MoS2 to Cs+ has reached 90 % in less than 110 min. Moreover, the adsorption properties of PB/Fe3O4/MoS2 remained good in the pH range of 2-7. Based on this, PB/Fe3O4/MoS2 complex was a fast and high selectivity adsorption material for Cs+, which was expected to be used in the practical treatment of cesium-containing radioactive wastewater."

Herein, we developed molybdenum nanodots (MNDs) as a functional nanomaterial with ultrasmall size, good biocompatibility, and excellent ROS scavenging ability for the treatment of acute lung injury (ALI). MNDs, which were administered intratracheally, significantly ameliorated lung oxidative stress, inflammatory response, protein permeability, and histological severity in ALI mice without inducing any safety issues. Importantly, transcriptomics analysis indicated that MNDs protected lung tissues by inhibiting the activation of the Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)-dependent pyroptotic pathway.

However, their practical in vivo application is hindered by the near-neutral pH and insufficient H2O2 levels present in physiological systems. This study was aimed at developing a SAzyme-based nanoreactor and investigating its in vivo antibacterial activity. METHODS: We developed a hollow mesoporous molybdenum single-atom nanozyme (HMMo-SAzyme) using a controlled chemical etching approach and pyrolysis strategy. The HMMo-SAzyme not only exhibited excellent catalytic activity but also served as an effective nanocarrier. By loading glucose oxidase (GOx) with HMMo-SAzyme and encapsulating it with hyaluronic acid (HA), a nanoreactor (HMMo/GOx@HA) was constructed as glucose-triggered cascade catalyst for combating bacterial infection in vivo. RESULTS: Hyaluronidase (HAase) at the site of infection degraded HA, allowing GOx to convert glucose into gluconic acid and H2O2. An acid environment significantly enhanced the catalytic activity of HMMo-SAzyme to promote the further catalytic conversion of H2O2 to •OH for bacterial elimination. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the nanoreactor had excellent antibacterial activity and negligible biological toxicity. CONCLUSION: This study represents a significant advancement in developing a cascade catalytic system with high efficiency based on hollow mesoporous SAzyme, promising the advancement of biological applications of SAzyme.",

The protein adsorption for fabricated scaffolds was increased at 24 h. The water adsorption and retention studies showed significant results on the PLGA-MBG-MoS2-Sim composite scaffold. The biodegradation studies of the PLGA-MBG-MoS2-Sim composite scaffold have shown 54% after 28 days. In vitro, bioactivity evaluation utilizing simulated body fluid studies confirmed the development of bone mineral hydroxyapatite on the scaffolds, which was characterized using x-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, and SEM analysis. Furthermore, the PLGA-MBG-MoS2-Sim composite scaffold is biocompatible with C3H10T1/2 cells and expresses more alkaline phosphatase and mineralization activity. Additionally, in vivo research showed that PLGA-MBG-MoS2-Sim stimulates a higher rate of bone regeneration.

This paper proposes a composition design of high-molybdenum-vanadium high-speed steel for rolls, and its specific chemical composition is as follows (wt.%): C2%, Mo7.0%, V7.0%, Si0.3%, Mn0.3%, Ni0.4%, Cr3.0%, and the rest of the iron. This design is characterized by the increase in molybdenum and vanadium in high-speed steel to replace traditional high-speed steel rolls with the tungsten element in order to reduce the heavy elements' tungsten-specific gravity segregation caused by centrifugal casting so that the roll performance is uniform and the stability of use is improved. JMatPro (version 7.0) simulation software is used for the composition design of high-molybdenum-vanadium high-speed steel. The phase composition diagram is analyzed under different temperatures. The content of different phases of the organization in different temperatures is also studied. The martensitic transformation temperature and different tempering temperatures with the different types of compounds and grain sizes are calculated. The process parameters of heat treatment of high-molybdenum-vanadium high-speed steel are optimized. The selection of carbon content and the temperature of M50 are calculated and optimized, and the results show that the range of pouring temperatures, quenching temperatures, annealing temperatures, and tempering temperatures are 1360~1410 °C, 1190~1200 °C, 818~838 °C, and 550~600 °C, respectively. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis of the samples obtained by using the above heat treatment parameters is consistent with the simulation results, which indicates that the simulation has important reference significance for guiding the actual production."

Herein, molybdenum (Mo) powder and sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) were selected to overcome these challenges. Sulfamethoxazole (SMX), as a model contaminant, was almost completely degraded in 60 min with higher removal rate (0.1367 min-1) than the Mo or STPP-absent system. In addition, Mo/STPP-Fe(Ⅲ)/SPC system was cost-effective in terms of oxidant consumption, requiring only 0.2 mM SPC. About activation mechanism, the main active species for SMX degradation was pH-dependent, with hydroxyl radical (·OH) as the dominant active species at pHi = 7 and ·OH, carbonate radical (CO3·-), and superoxide radical (O2·-) derived from a series of chain reaction at pHi = 10, respectively. Due to the generation of various electrophilic free radical, the system exhibited excellent performance towards electron-rich pollutants under a wide pH range. Furthermore, Mo exhibited excellent stability and reusability. SMX was degraded through hydroxylation, N-S cleavage, amino and sulfanilamide oxidation into intermediates whose toxicities were evaluated by Toxicity Estimation Software Tool (T.E.S.T.) software.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Bone defects in diabetes mellitus (DM) remain a major challenge for clinical treatment. Fluctuating glucose levels in DM patients lead to excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which disrupt bone repair homeostasis. Bone filler materials have been widely used in the clinical treatment of DM-related bone defects, but overall they lack efficacy in improving the bone microenvironment and inducing osteogenesis. We utilized a gelatine methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel with excellent biological properties in combination with molybdenum (Mo)-based polyoxometalate nanoclusters (POM) to scavenge ROS and promote osteoblast proliferation and osteogenic differentiation through the slow-release effect of POM, providing a feasible strategy for the application of biologically useful bone fillers in bone regeneration. METHODS: We synthesized an injectable hydrogel by gelatine methacrylate (GelMA) and POM. The antioxidant capacity and biological properties of the synthesized GelMA/POM hydrogel were tested. RESULTS: In vitro, studies showed that hydrogels can inhibit excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduce oxidative stress in cells through the beneficial effects of pH-sensitive POM. Osteogenic differentiation assays showed that GelMA/POM had good osteogenic properties with upregulated expression of osteogenic genes (BMP2, RUNX2, Osterix, ALP). Furthermore, RNA-sequencing revealed that activation of the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway in MC3T3-E1 cells with GelMA/POM may be a potential mechanism to promote osteogenesis. In an in vivo study, radiological and histological analyses showed enhanced bone regeneration in diabetic mice, after the application of GelMA/POM. CONCLUSION: In summary, GelMA/POM hydrogels can enhance bone regeneration by directly scavenging ROS and activating the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway.",

PURPOSE: This research mainly aims to compare and analyze the value of molybdenum target X-ray and high-frequency color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) in the early diagnosis of BC. METHODS: First, 102 patients with suspected early-stage BC (ESBC) admitted to Henan Provincial People's Hospital were examined by molybdenum target X-ray and CDFI. Based on the pathological findings, the diagnostic efficiency data of the two diagnostic modalities such as positive detection rate (PDR), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), and accuracy (ACC), as well as imaging information like masses, microcalcifications (MCs), axillary lymph node (LN) metastases, and blood flow signal or vascular sign abnormalities were analyzed. RESULTS: CDFI contributed to higher PDR, PRV, NPV, SEN, and ACC than molybdenum target X-ray in ESBC diagnosis, but similar SPE. The combined diagnosis of molybdenum target X-ray plus CDFI contributed to even higher PDR, PRV, NPV, SEN, and ACC than molybdenum target X-ray alone and higher ACC than CDFI. Imaging inspection revealed that the number of cases of masses, axillary LN metastases, and abnormalities in blood flow signals or vascular signs detected by CDFI was significantly higher than that by molybdenum target X-ray, while the number of MCs was significantly lower. CONCLUSION: Molybdenum target X-ray plus CDFI is more effective in the diagnosis of ESBC and plays a complementary role in imaging examination, which can synergistically improve the diagnostic ACC of ESBC and is worthy of clinical promotion."

      "abstract": "Soybean is a leguminous crop known for its efficient nitrogen utilization and ease of cultivation. However, its intercropping with maize may lead to severe reduction in its growth and yield due to shading effect of maize. This issue can be resolved by the appropriate application of essential plant nutrient such as molybdenum (Mo). Aim of this study was to assess the effect of Mo application on the morphological and physiological characteristics of soybean intercropped with maize. A two-year field experiment was conducted for this purpose, and Mo was applied in the form of sodium molybdate (Na2MoO4), and four different levels were maintained i.e., 0, 60, 120 and 180 g ha-1. Soybean exhibited varying responses to different levels of molybdenum (Mo) application. Notably, in both sole and intercropped cropping systems, the application of Mo at a rate of 120 g ha-1 demonstrated the highest level of promise compared to other application levels. However, most significant outcomes were pragmatic in soybean-maize intercropping, as application of Mo @ 120 g ha-1 significantly improved soybean growth and yield attributes, including leaf area index (LAI; 434 and 441%), total plant biomass (430 and 461%), transpiration rate (15 and 18%), stomatal conductance (9 and 11%), and yield (15 and 20%) during year 2020 and 2021 respectively, as compared to control treatment. Similarly, Mo @ 120 g ha-1 application resulted in highest total grain yield (626.0 and 725.3 kg ha-1) during 2020 and 2021 respectively, which exceeded the grain yields of other Mo levels under intercropping. Moreover, under Mo application level (120 g ha-1), grain NPK and Mo contents during years 2020 and 2021 were found to be 1.15, 0.22, 0.83 and 68.94 mg kg-1, and 1.27, 0.25, 0.90 and 72.18 mg kg-1 under intercropping system increased the value as compared to control treatment. Findings of current study highlighted the significance of Mo in enhancing soybean growth, yield, and nutrient uptake efficiency in maize-soybean intercropping systems."

      "abstract": "Given its abundant physiological functions, nitric oxide (NO) has attracted much attention as a cancer therapy. The sensitive release and great supply capacity are significant indicators of NO donors and their performance. Here, a transition metal nitride (TMN) MoN@PEG is adopted as an efficient NO donor. The release process starts with H+-triggered denitrogen owing to the high electronegativity of the N atom and weak Mo-N bond. Then, these active NHx are oxidized by O2 and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) to form NO, endowing specific release to the tumor microenvironment (TME). With a porous nanosphere structure (80 nm), MoN@PEG does not require an extra carrier for NO delivery, contributing to ultrahigh atomic utilization for outstanding release ability (94.1 ± 5.6 μM). In addition, it can also serve as a peroxidase and sonosensitizer for anticancer treatment. To further improve the charge separation, MoN-Pt@PEG was prepared to enhance the sonodynamic therapy (SDT) effect. Accordingly, ultrasound (US) further promotes NO generation due to more ROS generation, facilitating in situ peroxynitrite (·ONOO-) generation with great cytotoxicity. At the same time, the nanostructure also degrades gradually, leading to high elimination (94.6%) via feces and urine within 14-day. The synergistic NO and chemo-/sono-dynamic therapy brings prominent antitumor efficiency and further activates the immune response to inhibit metastasis and recurrence. This work develops a family of NO donors that would further widen the application of NO therapy in other fields.",

      "abstract": "Chromium (Cr) is a hazardous heavy metal that negatively affects animals and plants. The micronutrients selenium (Se) and molybdenum (Mo) have been widely shown to alleviate heavy metal toxicity in plants. However, the molecular mechanism of Cr chelation on the cell wall by combined treatment with Se and Mo has not been reported. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the effects of Se-Mo interactions on the subcellular distribution of Cr (50 µM) and on cell wall composition, structure, functional groups and Cr content, in addition to performing a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome. Our results showed that the cell walls of shoots and roots accumulated 51.0% and 65.0% of the Cr, respectively. Furthermore, pectin in the cell wall bound 69.5%/90.2% of the Cr in the shoots/roots. Se-Mo interactions upregulated the expression levels of related genes encoding galacturonosyltransferase (GAUT), UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (UGP), and UDP-glucose-4-epimerase (GALE), involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis, thereby increasing pectin and cellulose levels. Moreover, combined treatment with Se and Mo increased the lignin content and cell wall thickness by upregulating the expression levels of genes encoding cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), peroxidase (POX) and phenylalanine amino-lyase (PAL), involved in lignin biosynthesis. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy results showed that Se + Mo treatment (in combination) increased the number of carboxylic acid groups (-COOH) groups, thereby enhancing the Cr chelation ability. The results not only elucidate the molecular mechanism of action of Se-Mo interactions in mitigating Cr toxicity but also provide new insights for phytoremediation and food safety.",

Herein, we propose a novel MoS2/SnO2 (MS) S-scheme heterojunction by a facile hydrothermal process, which is cheap, easily available, highly visible-light response, and good stability. The MS nano-heterojunction suggested superior performance with the photocatalytic degradation of 97.6% within 100 min for ciprofloxacin (CIP) removal, which was 5.74 and 4.88 folds higher than that of pristine MoS2 and SnO2, respectively. The fabricated MS photocatalysts displayed outstanding photocatalytic efficiency toward Cr (VI) reduction. The removal capability of Cr (VI) reached up to 92.5% within 60 min. The photodegradation efficiency was 5.2 folds that of pristine MoS2. In addition, the antibacterial performance approximately approached 100% for E. coli within 10 min, which was more apparent than the others. A series of excellent results implied that MS nano-heterojunction had a high ultraviolet and visible light absorbance, larger specific surface area, outstanding electron-hole pairs migration and higher capability of photo-response electrons and holes separation rate. This system offers a novel window into the evolution of nano-heterojunction for wastewater treatment and solar energy harvesting applications.",

Forty male non-castrated crossbred Dorper x Santa Inês lambs (20 ± 1.2 kg of body weight and 90 ± 2 d of age) were randomly allocated into one of the ten following treatments: (T0) control, basal diet; (T1) Mo; (T2) inorganic Cu and inorganic S; (T3) inorganic Cu and organic S; (T4) organic Cu and inorganic S; (T5) organic Cu and organic S; (T6) Mo plus inorganic Cu and inorganic S; (T7) Mo plus inorganic Cu and organic S; (T8) Mo plus organic Cu and inorganic S; and (T9) Mo plus organic Cu and organic S. Regardless of the source, Mo, Cu, and S were added at levels of 10 mg, 10 mg, and 2000mg/kg DM, respectively. The mineral supplements (Mo, Cu, and S) were added into the total mixed ration (TMR) by mixing them apart with the mineral and vitamin premix and then put into the TMR. The animals were kept in individual pens and received a total mixed ration for 84 days. Body weight and blood sampling was performed every 28 days. All animals were slaughtered after 84 days, and carcass traits were evaluated. Although organic sources of Cu and S added to Mo supplementation had increased the ADG throughout the study, this effect did not reflect in the heavier final BW outcomes for this treatment. In addition, no effect of these treatments was observed on the carcass traits. The serum Cu concentration was higher for the T0 group compared to the other groups; otherwise, Mo reduced the serum Cu concentration compared to the other groups. Considering the interaction among the minerals and their sources at 84 d of study, organic sources of Cu and S treatment and Mo associated with inorganic sources of Cu plus organic S treatment had an increased serum Cu concentration compared to other groups. Regardless of time, organic sources of Cu and S increased serum S concentration. At 84 days after enrollment, serum Mo concentration was lower for the control group compared to the other groups. Further, Mo supplementation increased its blood concentration compared to the control group throughout the study. The control group had the highest ceruloplasmin activity compared to the other groups; otherwise, at 84 d of the study, either Mo or inorganic S supplementation reduced ceruloplasmin activity. Serum ceruloplasmin activity was higher when Cu supplementation, regardless of source, was associated with organic S. However, at d 84 of the study, inorganic Cu associated to organic S supplements increased serum ceruloplasmin activity. In this current study, it was not possible to identify a pattern in the variables studied, however, further studies are needed to confirm that organic sources of Cu and S interacted alone without a defined pattern."

The experiment was last for 50 d. The results showed that Mo and Cd co-exposure induced histopathological changes and ultrastructural damage, decreased the mRNA and protein expression levels of BTB (blood-testis barrier)-related factors (CX-43, ZO-1, OCLN) (P < 0.05) and the T-SOD and CAT activity (P < 0.05), increased the MDA content (P < 0.05) and the proinflammatory factors levels (P < 0.05) in sheep testes. Moreover, the results showed that a sharp decline in BTB-related factors and antioxidase activity, and a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels (P < 0.05) and the expression levels of NLRP3 inflammasome-related factors (P < 0.05) in primary Sertoli cells (SCs) under Mo and Cd co-exposure. However, treatment with a ROS scavenger or NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors could relieve BTB damage and oxidative injury, reduce the production of ROS (P < 0.05) and decrease the level of inflammatory factors (P < 0.05). Overall, these results indicated that Mo and Cd co-exposure reduced BTB-related protein levels and promoted ROS production and inflammatory reactions by activating the ROS/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in sheep testes, which eventually induced reproductive toxicity.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Nano fertilizers can provide efficient solutions to the increasing problem of nutrient deficiency caused by low availability. However, the most important prerequisite is to fully understand whether nanomaterials induce phytotoxicity in plants under a variety of different conditions. The mechanisms underlying interactions between molybdenum nanoparticles (Mo NPs) and plants with respect to their uptake and biological effects on crops are still not fully understood. METHODS: In this study, the impacts of Mo NPs over a range of concentrations (0, 25, and 100 μg/mL) on tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) seedling growth were comparatively evaluated under foliar applications and root irrigation. RESULTS: The results indicated that more significant active biological effects were observed with root irrigation application of Mo NPs than with foliar spraying. The agronomic attributes, water content and sugar content of Mo NPs-exposed seedlings were positively affected, and morphologically, Mo NPs induced root cell lignification and more vascular bundles and vessels in tobacco tissues, especially when applied by means of root irrigation. Moreover, the photosynthetic rate was improved by 131.4% for root exposure to 100 μg/mL Mo NPs, mainly due to the increased chlorophyll content and stomatal conductance. A significant concentration-dependent increase in malonaldehyde (MDA) and defensive enzyme activity for the Mo NPs-treated tobacco seedlings were detected compared to the controls. Significantly improved absorption of Mo by exposed tobacco seedlings was confirmed with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in tobacco tissues, regardless of application method. However, the accumulation of Mo in roots increased by 13.94 times, when roots were exposed to 100 mg/L Mo NPs, higher than that under treatment with foliar spray. Additionally, Mo NPs activated the expression of several genes related to photosynthesis and aquaporin processes. DISCUSSION: The present investigations offer a better understanding of Mo NPs-plant interactions in terrestrial ecosystems and provide a new strategy for the application of Mo NPs as nano fertilizers in crop production."

      "abstract": "Enhancing interfacial charge transfer is a promising approach to improve the efficiency of photocatalysts. This research effectively exploited an Ag-modified Z-scheme TiO2/Bi2MoO6 heterojunction for photocatalytic degradation and disinfection under visible light. The catalyst was fabricated using simple hydrothermal and photo-deposition methods, and the characterization outcomes revealed that a built-in electric field (BIEF) was generated in the TiO2/Bi2MoO6 heterojunctions, which significantly promotes the separation of photogenerated carriers and increases light absorption efficiency. Besides, the theoretical calculation demonstrated that electron migration between TiO2 and Ag resulted in a strong coupling on the surface, which serves as the foundation for driving photoelectric charge transfer. Furthermore, the TiO2/Bi2MoO6/Ag-45 displayed 459% and 512% higher degradation efficiency of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC-HCl) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) after 100 min compared to pristine TiO2. Moreover, the complexes wholly inactivated gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) and significantly inhibited the growth of gram-positive Staphylococcus albus (S. albus) after 200 min. Additionally, we have deduced the potential degradation pathways of TC-HCl and CIP and photocatalytic mechanisms. The research results provide an idea to solve the problems of limited light absorption range and rapid carrier combination speed of traditional photocatalytic materials, which is expected to be applied in the field of actual wastewater treatment."

Electron transfer is the intrinsic essence for a nanozyme-catalyzed redox reaction. Here, we developed a nanohole-array-induced metallic molybdenum selenide (n-MoSe2) that is enriched with Se vacancies and can serve as an electronic transfer station for cycling electrons between H2O2 decomposition and glutathione (GSH) depletion. In a MoSe2 nanohole array, the metallic phase reaches up to 84.5%, which has been experimentally and theoretically demonstrated to exhibit ultrasensitive H2O2 responses and enhanced peroxidase (POD)-like activities for H2O2 thermodynamic heterolysis. More intriguingly, plenty of delocalized electrons appear due to phase- and vacancy-facilitated band structure reconstruction. Combined with the limited characteristic sizes of nanoholes, the surface plasmon resonance effect can be excited, leading to the broad absorption spectrum spanning of n-MoSe2 from the visible to near-infrared region (NIR) for photothermal conversion. Under NIR laser irradiation, metallic MoSe2 is able to induce out-of-balance redox and metabolism homeostasis in the tumor region, thus significantly improving therapeutic effects. This study that takes advantage of phase and defect engineering offers inspiring insights into the development of high-efficiency photothermal nanozymes.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the HMs content and pollution sources within the basin. In this context, a total of 205 samples were collected from 21 surface water sampling stations. Heavy metal concentrations were measured using the Perkin Elmer NexION 350 ICP-MS with inductively coupled plasma. Findings demonstrate that high levels of HMs, such as Al, Mn, Mo, As, V, Fe, and Ba were exhibited with the value of 1257 μg/L, 626.8 μg/L, 116.7 μg/L, 61.2 μg/L, 100.5 μg/L, 1082.7 μg/L, and 211.7 μg/L, respectively. Among 20 HMs analyzed, 20% of the parameters within the study area were above the WHO limit for drinking water; Al (157 μg/L), V (100.5 μg/L), Fe (1082.7 μg/L), Mn (626.8 μg/L), and Mo (103.8 μg/L) were exhibited at sites along the river system. Likewise, 57% of water samples showed high values of As at many stations down the river systems. In particular, high HM concentrations seen in the upper Awash are primarily controlled by anthropogenic activities such as untreated industrial, agricultural, and domestic discharges, while the high HM concentrations in the middle Awash samples were likely due to the influence from the Lake Beseka that has high HM concentrations due to geological process. In conclusion, securing potable water for the rapidly increasing population in Addis Ababa and in the watersheds of Awash is unsafe to sustain the environment and the human health.",

This work investigated the impact of various combinations of Mo and P treatments on root morphology, P and Mo uptake, and root transcriptome and metabolome. Mo application significantly increased soybean biomass and the number of lateral roots at both low (5 μmol) or normal (500 μmol) P levels and significantly improved P concentration and accumulation in Normal P treatment. Compared with the Normal P treatment, Low P significantly increased the number of roots, root surface area, and root acid phosphatase secretion. A total of 6811 Mo-responsive differentially expressed genes and 135 differential metabolites were identified at two P levels. At Low P, transcriptional changes significantly increased root synthesis and secretion of succinic acid, methylmalonic acid, and other organic acids as well as acid phosphatase, thereby increasing the conversion of soil aluminum-bound P and organic P into available P. At Normal P, Mo application increased P uptake mainly by increasing the number of lateral roots. Thus, Mo helps crops adapt to different P levels by regulating root anatomy and transcriptional and metabolic profiles of their roots.",

Disk-shaped Co-Cr-Mo alloy prepared by casting were subjected to different UV treatment times (0, 15, and 30 min). To determine the effect of UV treatment on surface properties of the alloy, surface roughness, wettability, and chemical compositions were analyzed. To evaluate the SBS, cylindrical PMMA was bonded to the UV-treated alloy, and subsequently subjected to the SBS test after 24 h of storage at room temperature or following 10,000 thermal cycles (n=10/group). After the UV treatment, the surface roughness remained unchanged, but oxidation resulted in the surface exhibiting greater hydrophilic characteristics. The UV-treated group showed significantly higher SBS values than those of the non-treated group (p<0.001). These results suggested that UV treatment-mediated oxidation improved the bond strength between PMMA and Co-Cr-Mo alloy."
