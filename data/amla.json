      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) pose a significant risk for cardiovascular diseases and associated complications in individuals with hyperlipidemia. Statin therapy, effective in reducing cholesterol and cardiovascular risks, paradoxically increases incident T2DM risk due to its adverse impact on glucose homeostasis. Therefore, there is a pressing need for safe, and effective adjunctive or alternative therapies to manage hyperglycemia in hyperlipidemic individuals. There is growing body of pharmacological evidence suggesting that Amla and Olive extract supplementation can be beneficial in managing hyperglycemia in individuals with hyperlipidemia. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to assess for the first time the potential synergistic antihyperglycemic effects of a daily co-supplementation of 1,000 mg Amla fruit and 50 mg Olive fruit standardized extracts (Cholesfytol NG®) over a 2-months period in hyperlipidemic adults with T2DM or prediabetes. METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional observational study analyzed treatment outcomes in 191 hyperlipidemic adults under the care of their physicians at 57 General Practitioner clinics in Belgium during real-life clinical practice between March 19, 2020, and January 31, 2022. These participants received Cholesfytol NG® as supplementary therapy to improve their metabolic health. The supplement was prescribed in an open-label, non-randomized manner, tailored to each participant's need. RESULTS: After 2-months of Cholesfytol NG® supplementation, participants showed significant reductions in glycemia levels: in the T2DM group, levels decreased by 42.7 ± 17.9 mg/dL (27.9%, p < 0.0001), and in the prediabetic group, by 2.26 ± 11.5 mg/dL (4.7%, p = 0.0020). Conversely, no significant change was observed in participants with normal baseline glycemia (1.55 ± 10.3 mg/dL, p = 0.088). Overall, glycemia levels decreased from 96.4 ± 18.2 mg/dL to 94.0 ± 13.5 mg/dL (mean decrease of 2.4 ± 14.5 mg/dL, p < 0.0001). The supplement was well tolerated and no side-effects, serious adverse events, or treatment-emergent effects were reported. CONCLUSION: The findings of this real-life clinical study highlight the potential synergistic antihyperglycemic effects of co-supplementation with Amla and Olive fruit extracts in managing hyperglycemia, particularly in individuals with hyperlipidemia. These results suggest that this botanical combination may help mitigate risks associated with hyperglycemia and cardiovascular disease in hyperlipidemic population.

      "abstract": "Background: Hyperlipidemia is associated with a higher rate of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular disease. Conventional drugs such as statins are effective in controlling hyperlipidemia; however, they are associated with various side effects, especially myalgia. Nutraceutical lipid-lowering interventions are becoming increasingly popular, particularly among patients who are intolerant or refractory to statins. Substantial preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that extracts of amla, walnut, and olive, and red yeast rice (RYR) powder possess significant antihyperlipidemic effects. Aims: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and patient satisfaction of a combined supplementation of standardized dry extracts of amla fruit (500 mg), walnut leaves (50 mg), olive fruit (25 mg), and RYR powder (33.6 mg) (Cholesfytol NG®) in hypercholesterolemic patients. Methods: This was a real-life setting, retrospective, observational, single-arm, non-randomized study in hypercholesterolemic patients (total cholesterol (TC) ≥ 200 mg/dL or low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 130 mg/dL), enrolled at 57 general practitioner (GP) surgeries in Belgium from March 2020 to January 2022. These patients received a GP-prescribed daily single dosage of two oral tablets of Cholesfytol NG® supplementation for 2 months to overcome their hypercholesterolemia in the absence of a conventional lipid-lowering drug (n = 208) or with a lipid-lowering drug (n = 13). At 2-month follow-up, the lipid profile was re-evaluated, alongside a patient's questionnaire on treatment general satisfaction and willingness to pursue supplementation. Results: After supplementation, TC decreased by 15%, LDL-C by 19%, non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C) by 20% (all p < 0.0001), triglycerides (TG) by 9% (p = 0.0028) (-18.4%, p = 0.0042, in patients with baseline TG > 180 mg/dL, n = 58), and remnant cholesterol (RC) by 12% (p = 0.0001). These changes were unaffected by statin intolerance status in patients who received Cholesfytol NG® alongside statin. The supplement was well tolerated by all patients, and no serious adverse events or supplement-emergent effects were reported. Most patients were satisfied with the supplementation and wanted to pursue the nutraceutical. Conclusion: According to the results of this study, a combined supplementation of amla, walnut, and olive extracts, and RYR powder exerts a significant antihyperlipidemic effect, leading to a decrease in circulatory LDL-C and RC levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia. The supplementation bears excellent safety and tolerability, and is rated as satisfactory and pursuable, even among patients with statin intolerance.

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a deteriorating neural disorder, and currently, available drugs are ineffective in its treatment. Emblica officinalis (Amla) is widely recognised in the Indian medicinal system for ameliorative effects in managing diabetes, hyperlipidaemia and neurological diseases. Thus, we aimed to identify the active phytoconstituents of E. officinalis and their role in inhibiting the potential targets for the possible treatment of AD. The network pharmacology approach, gene ontology, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) studies were performed. A total of 36 bioactive components in E. officinalis, 95 predicted anti-AD targets, and 3398 AD-related targets were identified from different databases. The network analysis showed that BACE1, ABCB1 and AChE, CA2 are the most potential AD targets. Based on gene ontology and topology analysis results, BACE1 was a significant target related to AD pathways, and quercetin, kaempferol and myricetin showed the highest interaction with target genes. The molecular docking results found that rutin and quercetin displayed better binding affinities -7.5, -5.67 kcal/mol than the BACE1 bound internal ligand. Furthermore, MDS results suggested that quercetin and rutin could be potential inhibitors against BACE-1 protein and may have therapeutic effects in treating AD. Such promising results could be further helpful in new drug discovery against AD.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Amla (Phyllanthus emblica) fruit has been emphasized as a hair tonic in Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM) and recommended for hair loss orally and topically. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the effect of an oral product containing Amla fruit on Female Androgenetic Alopecia (FAGA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a triple-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial. Sixty women with FAGA were randomly assigned into two groups of thirty. The intervention group received ten cc Amla syrup thrice a day for 12 weeks. The second group received a placebo with the same dose and duration. Hair growth parameters were analyzed using TrichoScan before and after 12 weeks of intervention. Physician and patient satisfaction were assessed using the CGI-I and PGI-I questionnaires, respectively. RESULTS: Twenty-seven participants in the intervention group and 25 in the placebo group completed the trial. Based on our findings, the anagen-to-telogen ratio increased significantly in the intervention group compared with the group who received placebo (F = 10.4, P = 0.002). Physician and patient satisfaction increased in the amla group compared with placebo at 12th weeks of intervention (P<0.001), (P<0.001). The formula had no remarkable side effects. Only one case of mild constipation was reported in one of the participants after one month of consuming Amla syrup. CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrated that Amla syrup could help treat androgenic hair loss in women and increase the anagen phase. Further studies are needed to evaluate this potential treatment for FAGA.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Emblica Officinalis (Amla) is a plant often utilized in traditional medicine due to its purported anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, hypoglycemic, and hypolipidemic properties. However, current evidence regarding its potential for preventing and treating metabolic abnormalities associated with chronic diseases remains unclear. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the effects of Amla supplementation on lipid profile, glucose, and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations in adults. We completed a systematic search (current as of December 2022) of all available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the database including ISI Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Embase. Any effect's mean difference (MD) was calculated using a random-effects model. Weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated also calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Five RTCs were included in the meta-analysis. Following Amla supplementation, pooled results showed a significant reduction in CRP (p = 0.002), fasting blood glucose (FBG) (p < 0.001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) (p < 0.001), total cholesterol (TC) (p < 0.001), and serum triglyceride (TG) (p < 0.001) concentrations as well as an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) (p < 0.001). The baseline concentration of biochemical indicators was used for subgroup analysis. CONCLUSION: Amla supplementation shows promise for improving metabolic parameters in adults. In general, the populations included in the analysis were generally 40-58 years with an average BMI of 25.5 and a length of intervention ranging from 3 to 12 weeks. Thus additional investigations are warranted to confirm and expand the findings presented herein.",

      "abstract": "Disease is the main reason for the use of antimicrobials in calf rearing, and antibiotics are commonly used to treat calves, including for unknown diseases. This leads to antimicrobial resistance, which is a challenge to the livestock industry and public health. Plant products containing high levels of phytochemicals may improve the immunity and resistance of calves against infections, thereby reducing the use of antimicrobials. This study aimed to investigate the effect of Phyllanthus emblica (Amla) fruit powder (PE) supplementation on antioxidant capacity and immune response of preweaning dairy calves. One hundred, 2-day-old, male Holstein calves were randomly assigned into five treatment groups receiving 0, 5, 10, 20, and 40 g/d PE supplementation. Antioxidant and immune indices and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were analyzed from serum samples, whereas 16S rRNA was analyzed from rumen fluid and fecal samples. PE supplementation, at 5 g/d, protected calves against oxidative stress and improved antioxidant enzymes and immune and anti-inflammatory responses, showing its immunity-enhancing and protective roles against infections. However, the antioxidant capacity and immune response decreased with increasing PE levels, illustrating the adverse effects of PE supplementation at higher doses. The analysis of ruminal and fecal bacterial community abundance detected higher proportions of Firmicutes at an early age, and a higher Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratio at weaning, in calves supplemented with 5 g/d PE. This contributed to the development of the immune system in early life, and improved immune and anti-inflammatory responses at a later age. The overall results suggest that PE could be supplemented at 5 g/d for preweaning dairy calves to protect against oxidative stress and infections while maintaining normal gut microbial hemostasis."

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of a diet supplemented with fresh amla fruit as a natural feed additive on blood metabolic parameters, milk antioxidant capacity, and milk fatty acid (FA) proportions in lactating dairy cows. Eight ruminally cannulated mid-lactation dairy cows were used in a repeated crossover design. The first group of four cows received total mixed ration (TMR) feed without fresh amla fruit (control group). The remaining four cows sequentially supplemented fresh amla fruit (FAF) at three levels (200, 400, then 600 g/d) (treatment group) at 14-day intervals. In second period, control and treatment groups were exchanged. The first ten days were adjusted to diet adaptation for each sub-period, and the last four days for sampling milk and blood. A total of 514 metabolites were detected from FAF using UPLC-ESI-MS/MS. The five main metabolites in FAF were phenolic acids (22%), flavonoids (20%), lipids (20%), amino acids and derivatives (9%), and tannins (7%). Amla fruit supplementation reduced total saturated fatty acid and the omega-6/omega-3 ratio at 200 or 400 g/d FAF dose compared to controls. In addition, amla fruit increased unsaturated FA, such as C20:5 (Eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA) and C22:6 (docosahexaenoic acid, DHA), and branched-chain FA in a dose-dependent manner at 200 or 400 g/d compared to controls. In addition, amla fruit increased the antioxidant capacity biomarkers in the blood, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and albumin; this confirms that amla fruit is an excellent antioxidant, inhibiting reactive oxygen species' (ROS) metabolism, and can thereby protect cells from oxidative stress. Moreover, the most remarkable improvement of ferric reducing-antioxidant power (FRAP) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in milk was recorded at 400 g/d FAF doses compared to controls. Therefore, fresh amla fruit doses for lactating cows at 400 g/d on an as-fed basis can be used as an alternative additive feed in dairy cow diets to improve antioxidant capacity, protein efficiency, butter quality, and to produce more desirable milk fatty acid profiles for human consumption."

METHODS: In this RCT, sixty-one patients were randomly assigned into two arms [the intervention (n=31) and control arms (n=30)]. The effect of Amla on diagnostic Reverse-transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test results between the first and the last days of the study, the length of stay (LOS) in hospital, the percentage of lung involvement on CT scans, changes in the clinical symptoms, and the laboratory markers were assessed. RESULTS: The two study groups had similar baseline demographics and characteristics in terms of medical history. The mean of LOS in the intervention arm (4.44 days) was significantly shorter than in the control arm (7.18 days, P < 0.001); RT-PCR results were not significantly different between the two arms (P = 0.07). All clinical variables decreased over time in the two groups (P < 0.001). However, the difference between the two groups in terms of fever (P = 0.004), severity of cough (P = 0.001), shortness of breath (P = 0.004), and myalgia (P = 0.005) were significant, but this intergroup comparison was not significant with regard to respiratory rate (P = 0.29), severity of chills (P = 0.06), sore throat (P = 0.22), and weakness (P = 0.12). Out of the eight evaluated para-clinical variables, three variables showed significant improvement in the intervention arm, including the mean increase in oxygen saturation (SpO2) level (P < 0.001), the reduction in the mean percentage of lung involvement on CT (P < 0.001), and the improvement in C-reactive protein test results (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Organic herbal Amla tea cannot significantly affect the RT-PCR results and or degree of lung involvement. Nevertheless, it showed an ameliorative effect on the severity of clinical signs and CRP levels. Also, Amla tea may shorten the recovery times of symptoms and LOS in COVID-19 patients.",

Earlier, we reported that arsenic induced enhanced oxidative stress, inflammation, dislipidemia and hepatotoxicity in mice have been protected by treatment with Emblica officinalis (amla). The present study has therefore been focused to investigate the efficacy of amla in mitigation of arsenic induced hyperglycemia in mice. Arsenic exposure (3 mg/kg b.w./day for 30 days) in mice altered glucose homeostasis and significantly decreases hepatic glucose regulatory enzyme, glucokinase (43%), glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase (38%), malic enzyme (60%) and significantly increases the level of glucose-6 phosphates (65%), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (43%), lactate, (59%) Na+ (6.8%) Cl- (10.4%), anion gap (13.9%) and pancreatic (IL-1β, TNF-α) inflammation markers (52%, 53%) as compared to controls. Arsenic exposure also significantly decreased serum insulin (44%) and c-peptide protein (38%) in mice as compared to controls. Co-administration of arsenic and amla (500 mg/kg b.w./day for 30 days) balanced blood sugar level, hepatic glucose regulatory enzyme (glucokinase, glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme (68%, 37%, 45%) and significantly decreases glucose-6 phosphatase (25%), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (22%), blood ion concentration and also lactate, Na+, Cl- and anion gap (20%, 4.6%, 6.7%, 5.2%), pancreatic (IL-1β, TNF-α) inflammation marker (21%, 24%) and significantly increased the serum insulin (57%) and c-peptide protein (31%) as compared to those treated with arsenic alone. Results of the present study suggests that the hypoglycemic and antioxidant property of amla could be responsible for its protective efficacy in arsenic induced hyperglycemia."

      "abstract": "Background: Ovarian cancer (OC), the most lethal gynecologic malignancy, is highly resistant to current treatment strategies. High-grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer (HGSOC) cells with increased somatic mutations and genomic instability and the resulting heterogeneous mutant phenotypes are highly resistant to therapy. Plant-derived natural products, including Amla (Emblica officinalis) extract (AE), have demonstrated potent anti-neoplastic properties. Recently we demonstrated that AE inhibits cell growth and the expression of angiogenic factors in OVCAR3 and SKOV3 OC cells in vitro as well as in xenografts in vivo. The goal of this study was to determine the anti-proliferative, anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic effects of AE on carboplatinum- and taxol-resistant HGSOC cells carrying p53, BRCA1/2 mutations. Methods: Anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects of AE on recently characterized carboplatinum- and taxol-resistant HGSOC cells (TOV3041G, OV866(2), OV4453 and, OV4485) was determined using the MTT, migration, invasion and spheroid assays in vitro. To understand the mechanism of AE-induced changes in angiogenesis-related hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and insulin growth factor receptor 1 (IGF1R), and EMT-associated SNAIL1 and E-cadherin proteins were studied using immunostaining and Western blotting. In vivo effects of AE were determined using mouse xenograft tumor model of OC developed by subcutaneous injection of OV4485 cells that carry mutant p53 and BRCA1, most aggressive and resistant among HGSOC cell lines used in this study. Tumor growth was measured using morphometry. Immunostaining and Western blotting were used to determine changes in Ki67 (proliferation marker), CD31 (angiogenesis marker) as well as changes in HIF-1α, IGF1R, SNAIL1 and E-cadherin proteins. Results: AE significantly attenuated migration and invasiveness properties of all tested HGSOC cell phenotypes (P≤0.001), significantly reduced the expression of HIF-1α, IGF1R, and SNAIL1 and increased the expression of E-cadherin in all tested HGSOC cell lines (P=<0.05). Oral administration of AE for 4 weeks caused a significant regression of mouse xenograft tumor (>60%) that derived from OV4855 cells and decreased the expression of endothelial cell antigen-CD31, HIF-1α, IGF1R and SNAIL1 and increased the expression of E-cadherin in tumor tissues. Conclusions: AE sensitizes platinum- and taxol-resistant heterogenous HGSOC cells carrying mutations in p53, BRCA1/2 genes, and attenuates their malignant characteristics through targeting key signaling mechanisms of angiogenesis and metastasis. AE is a potential adjunct therapeutic agent for treating resistant, mutant, heterogenous OC."

Amla preparations have been used for centuries in traditional Indian medicine systems such as Ayurveda, with various parts of the plant used to treat a variety of diseases. Here we review many animal-based studies, and some clinical trials, which have shown that Amla, and its extracts, exert many positive effects on dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and autophagy, that contribute to AD risk. Collectively, this evidence suggests that Amla may be of value as part of an effective disease-delaying treatment for AD.",

Emblica officinalis (amla), a traditional medicine, is one such medicament which has never been evaluated for its healing potential in pulp therapy. AIMS: The aim of the study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity of E. officinalis (amla) against human primary dental pulp fibroblasts. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was in vitro study. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Human dental pulp fibroblasts were obtained from dental pulp tissue of extracted over-retained primary incisors. The primary cells were cultured using the Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium and used for the study after the fourth passage. The test medicament was E. officinalis with mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) (100%) and untreated cells as positive and negative controls, respectively. Methyl-thiazol-diphenyl-tetrazolium (MTT) cytotoxicity assay was performed, and the cell survival was observed and analyzed at intervals of 24, 48, and 72 h. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Cell survival within groups was compared with Wilcoxon matched-paired t-test and in between groups at each point interval was analyzed with the Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA test. The level of significance was set at 0.05. RESULTS: Within the groups, across the time periods of evaluation, there was a decline in cell survival in both the groups but was statistically significant in the MTA group. On interval-wise comparison, the decline in cell survival was statistically significant between the three groups at 72 h (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: E. officinalis preserved the vitality of the human primary dental pulp fibroblasts and has the potential to be developed into vital pulp therapy medicament.",

Herbal drugs, which have been used in traditional medicine for centuries, are also being explored and scientifically evaluated for the treatment of these neurological disorders. While substantial evidence exists for the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-hyperlipidemic, and anti-hyperglycemic effects of Emblica officinalis, in vivo and in vitro studies, have also revealed its beneficial therapeutic activities in numerous neurological disorders. These diverse neuroprotective pharmacodynamic actions of E. officinalis corroborated by accumulating evidence in pre-clinical research studies deserve the attention of the scientific community to develop viable pharmacotherapeutic strategies.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Whitening of teeth is a popular choice among dental clinicians and patients. However, the changes in enamel structure and composition induced by the bleaching agents cause a decrease in the shear bond strength of brackets leading to premature bracket debonding. Among several methods to overcome this, the most common is delaying bonding by 2-4 weeks. This waiting period can be eliminated by applying an antioxidant (sodium ascorbate) which causes a reversal in the reduction of bond strength. AIM: This study aims to compare the efficacy of a naturally occurring antioxidant (gooseberry) and sodium ascorbate in normalizing the bond strength of enamel to prebleached levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-two extracted premolars were divided into 4 equal groups; 1st group - control group - unbleached teeth, bonded directly, 2nd group - bleached with 16% carbamide peroxide (8 h for 1 week), then bonded. 3rd and 4th group - similarly bleached, followed by application of 10% sodium ascorbate and gooseberry extract (3 h respectively), then bonded. Bond strength was checked using Instron Universal Testing Machine. RESULTS: The bond strength of the control group was the highest and that of the carbamide group was drastically reduced. Considerable increase in the bond strength was seen after treatment with sodium ascorbate with negligible difference between sodium ascorbate and control group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Treatment with gooseberry extract did improve the bond strength but was not as effective as sodium ascorbate postbleaching.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the most common gastrointestinal complaints. GERD, caused by the reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus, leads to troublesome symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation. It is classified into two types: erosive esophagitis, characterized by visible esophageal mucosa erosion in endoscopy, and non-erosive reflux disease (NERD). GERD is a chronic and recurrent disease that impairs the quality of life and imposes socioeconomic and therapeutic burdens to both patients and society. OBJECTIVE: Due to the failure of the conventional treatments for GERD and to the traditional use of Amla (Phyllanthus emblica L.), in addition to beneficial effects shown in recent studies, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of Amla tablet for improvement of symptoms of patients with NERD. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: We designed a double-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Sixty-eight patients who had classic symptoms of GERD (heartburn, regurgitation and epigastralgia) for at least three months before the start of the trial were randomized in two parallel groups. Patients in the Amla group received two 500 mg Amla tablets twice a day, after meals, for 4 weeks. In the control group, patients received placebo tablets similar to the Amla prescription. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The patients were visited at baseline, and at the end of the 2nd and 4th weeks of intervention; their symptoms were measured on a frequency and severity scale for the symptoms of NERD, according to the quality of life in reflux-associated disease questionnaire. RESULTS: Frequencies of heartburn and regurgitation in both groups of the study were significantly reduced after intervention (P < 0.001). Repeated measures logistic regression analysis showed that, in the Amla group, there was a more significant reduction in regurgitation frequency, heartburn frequency, regurgitation severity and heartburn severity during the study period, compared with the placebo group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial demonstrated that Amla could reduce frequencies of heartburn and regurgitation and improve heartburn and regurgitation severity in patients with NERD.

METHODS: A total of 80 female wistar rats (5-months-old) were divided into eight different groups. Propylthiouracil (PTU) and HFD were used to induce the experimental HT and obesity, respectively. The euthyroid and hypothyroid rats were fed either normal chow or HFD with and without amla extract (AE, 100 mg/kg bw/day) for 6 weeks. The blood and tissues, liver and kidney OS and inflammatory parameters were studied using appropriate biochemical and molecular techniques. RESULTS: PTU and HFD per se caused OS and inflammatory response as evidenced by increased plasma MDA, TNF-α, CRP and GPx in association with decreased levels of TAS and reduced glutathione (GSH). The proteomic analysis revealed that the expressions of pERK, pP38, TNF-α, IL6, COX2 and NOX-4 were up-regulated in the liver and kidney of these rats. In addition, all these metabolic derangements were further augmented when HT was followed by the addition of HFD. This suggested that there was a synergism between HT and the intake of HFD on the development of OS and inflammatory response. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment with amla fruit extract significantly restored the redox imbalance and inflammatory signaling and ameliorated OS and inflammatory response, suggesting the use of this natural compound as an alternative remedy or adjuvant for the management of metabolic complications concomitant with HT.",

The percentage cure rate of sub-clinically mastitic quarters in group A, B and C were 80.95%, 64.7% and 22.22% at day 14 respectively. The quarter based bacteriological cure rate was highest in group A (80.95%) followed by group B (64.7%) and group C (22.22%). The pH was significant (P > .05) in group A, B and C at day 0, 7 and 14.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is a proposed cause of aging through elevated oxidative stress. In this study, we investigated the effects of Amla on mitochondrial function in C2C12 myotubes, a murine skeletal muscle cell model with abundant mitochondria. Based on cell flux analysis, treatment with an extract of Amla fruit enhanced mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity, which enables cells to overcome various stresses. To further explore the mechanisms underlying these effects on mitochondrial function, we analyzed mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant systems, both proposed regulators of mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity. We found that Amla treatment stimulated both systems accompanied by AMPK and Nrf2 activation. Furthermore, we found that Amla treatment exhibited cytoprotective effects and lowered reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in cells subjected to t-BHP-induced oxidative stress. These effects were accompanied by increased oxygen consumption, suggesting that Amla protected cells against oxidative stress by using enhanced spare respiratory capacity to produce more energy. Thus we identified protective effects of Amla, involving activation of mitochondrial function, which potentially explain its various effects on age-related disorders.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Increased fructose consumption causes dyslipidemia and fatty liver in postmenopausal women, both independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease. This study explored the potential mechanisms by which amla (Emblica officinalis) reduced hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia and prevented fatty liver in a fructose-fed, ovariectomized rat model of menopause. METHODS: Sham-operated and ovariectomized rats were put on a chow or high fructose diet. They were further divided into groups with or without amla. After 18 weeks of treatment, livers were harvested and subjected to Western blot and histological analyses. RESULTS: In all groups, amla increased the protein expression of liver farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and liver X receptor (LXR), key proteins involved in lipid metabolism. Fructose-fed rats developed fatty liver and amla prevented this. Here amla produced an exceptional rise in LXR and insulin-induced gene-2 (Insig-2) which prevented the maturation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 and steroyl CoA desaturase-1, responsible for triglyceride synthesis. Amla also increased the protein expression of ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), involved in high density lipoprotein (HDL) synthesis as well as low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) responsible for uptake of LDL cholesterol. Besides this, amla increased the protein expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα) involved in β oxidation of fatty acids. CONCLUSIONS: Amla increased the protein expression of liver FXR, LXRα, PPARα and their downstream proteins Insig-2, ABCA1 and LDLR. This property of amla to modulate some of the key proteins involved in lipid metabolism promises its usefulness as a preventive agent for dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis.",

OBJECTIVE: In view of increasing risk of arsenic exposure due to occupational and non-occupational settings, the present study has been focused to investigate the protective efficacy of amla against arsenic-induced spleenomegaly in mice. RESULTS: Arsenic exposures (3 mg/kg body weight p.o for 30 days) in mice caused an increase production of ROS (76%), lipid peroxidation (84%) and decrease in the levels of superoxide dismutase (53%) and catalase (54%) in spleen as compared to controls. Arsenic exposure to mice also caused a significant increase in caspases-3 activity (2.8 fold) and decreases cell viability (44%), mitochondrial membrane potential (47%) linked with apoptosis assessed by the cell cycle analysis (subG1-28.72%) and annexin V/PI binding in spleen as compared to controls. Simultaneous treatment of arsenic and amla (500 mg/kg body weight p.o for 30 days) in mice decreased the levels of lipid peroxidation (33%), ROS production (24%), activity of caspase-3 (1.4 fold), apoptosis (subG1 12.72%) and increased cell viability (63%), levels superoxide dismutase (80%), catalase (77%) and mitochondrial membrane potential (66%) as compared to mice treated with arsenic alone. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the present study indicate that the effect of arsenic is mainly due to the depletion of glutathione in liver associated with enhanced oxidative stress that has been found to be protected following simultaneous treatment of arsenic and amla."

The present study evaluated the anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant properties of amla fruit extract. The amla fruit extract potentially and significantly reduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tissue factor expression and von Willebrand factor release in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations (1-100 μg/ml). In a leucocyte adhesion model of inflammation, it also significantly decreased LPS-induced adhesion of human monocytic cells (THP-1) to the HUVEC, as well as reduced the expression of endothelial-leucocyte adhesion molecule-1 (E-selectin) in the target cells. In addition, the in vivo anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated in a LPS-induced endotoxaemia rat model. Oral administration of the amla fruit extract (50 mg/kg body weight) significantly decreased the concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6 in serum. These results suggest that amla fruit extract may be an effective anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory agent.",

      "abstract": "Emblica officinalis, commonly known as amla, is an important medicinal plant of India. Its fruits have potent antioxidant activity due to the presence of tannoids, tannins, vitamin C and flavonoids. The aim of this study was to investigate the beneficial effect of the hydroalcoholic extract of the fruits of Emblica officinalis (EO) on memory impairment in Swiss albino mice. Scopolamine (1 mg kg(-1), i.p)was administered to induce amnesia and the memory was evaluated by using elevated plus-maze and passive avoidance tests. Piracetam (200 mg kg(-1), i.p.) was used as a standard nootropic agent. The EO extract was administered intraperitoneally in four graded doses (150, 300, 450 and 600 mg kg(-1)) for 7 consecutive days to different groups of mice. The mice were sacrificed on the 8th day following assessment of memory. The brain malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) as well as acetylcholinesterase (AchE)) activity was determined. It was observed that EO extract reversed the amnesia induced by scopolamine. The mean transfer latency and retention latency in the EO extract 600 mg kg(-1) group vs the vehicle treated scopolamine group was 13.46 sec (p<0.001) and 134.4 sec (p<0.001) vs 23.99 sec and 44.55 sec, respectively. EO extract treatment also significantly (p<0.001) ameliorated the oxidative stress induced by scopolamine administration. The mice brain MDA and GSH levels in the EO extract 600 mg kg(-1) group vs the scopolamine group were 29.95 nmol g(-1) of wet tissue and 51.87 microg g(-1) tissue vs 55.22 nmol g(-1) of wet tissue and 28.33 microg g(-1) tissue, respectively. Further, EO extract (300, 450 and 600 mg kg(-1), i.p) significantly (p<0.001) reversed the rise in brain acetyl cholinesterase (AchE) level induced by scopolamine. The mice brain Ach E levels in the EO extract 600 mg kg(-1) group as compared to the scopolamine group was 70.23 vs 151.49 U mg(-1) protein(-1), respectively. These results suggestthat EO possesses memory enhancing, antioxidant and anti-cholinesterase activity. It may be useful for the treament of cognitive impairments induced by cholinergic dysfunction. Its potential in the management of dementia and Azheimer disease needs to be further explored.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of Amla in patients with type II hyperlipidemia and compare its hypolipidemic effects with those of simvastatin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty type II hyperlipidemic patients of both sexes with plasma total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein level more than 240 mg% and 130 mg%, respectively, were selected for the trial. Out of total 60 selected patients, 40 were treated with Amla capsule (500 mg) daily for 42 days and 20 patients were given simvastatin capsule (20 mg) daily for 42 days. After the day of enrolment, all patients were followed up twice during the 42-day period. Blood samples were analyzed for various biochemical parameters and the values of Total Cholesterol (TC), Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL), High Density Lipoprotein (HDL), and Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) were measured before and after completion of the treatment with Amla and simvastatin. Cardiovascular parameters were recorded before and after completion of treatment. RESULTS: Treatment with Amla produced significant reduction of TC (P<0.0001), LDL (P<0.0001), triglyceride (TG) and VLDL (P<0.0002), and a significant increase in HDL levels (P<0.0002). Similarly, treatment with simvastatin produced significant reduction of TC (P<0.0001), LDL (P<0.0009), TG and VLDL (P<0.017), and a significant increase in HDL levels (P<0.0001). Both treatments produced significant reduction in blood pressure; however, this beneficial effect was more marked in patients receiving Amla. CONCLUSION: In view of the above findings, it is suggested that Amla produced significant hypolipidemic effect along with a reduction in blood pressure. Addition of Amla to the currently available hypolipidemic therapy would offer significant protection against atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease, with reduction in the dose and adverse effects of the hypolipidemic agents."

Drug resistant strains of TB are becoming a global public health risk. These strains commonly appear due to faulty therapies. Patients frequently stop treatment due to the toxicity of anti-tubercular treatment (ATT) drugs. Amla (Emblica officinalis) is a well-known Unani single drug. Jawarish amla is a Unani compound formulation which is commonly used to administer amla. This study tested the efficacy of Jawarish amla as an adjuvant to ATT drugs in reducing their side effects. METHODOLOGY: Half of forty eligible pulmonary tuberculosis patients were randomly assigned to Test (Group B) and the other half to Control (Group A). Six grams of Jawarish amla twice daily was administered to the test group, and the same dosage of placebo was administered to control group along with directly observed treatment, short course chemotherapy (DOTS) for 60 days. Fisher exact test and paired t-test were applied for efficacy evaluation. Grading of symptoms was done to assess the toxicity of ATT and outcome of the adjuvant. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Significant improvements were observed in almost all subjective and objective parameters. The exceptions were serum creatine and serum uric acid, which showed non-significant slight elevations within normal limits. CONCLUSION: Jawarish amla was ascertained to be safe and effective adjuvant of DOTS in combating the adverse effects of ATT drugs."

Various parts of the plant are used to treat a range of diseases, but the most important is the fruit. The fruit is used either alone or in combination with other plants to treat many ailments such as common cold and fever; as a diuretic, laxative, liver tonic, refrigerant, stomachic, restorative, alterative, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, hair tonic; to prevent peptic ulcer and dyspepsia, and as a digestive. Preclinical studies have shown that amla possesses antipyretic, analgesic, antitussive, antiatherogenic, adaptogenic, cardioprotective, gastroprotective, antianemia, antihypercholesterolemia, wound healing, antidiarrheal, antiatherosclerotic, hepatoprotective, nephroprotective, and neuroprotective properties. In addition, experimental studies have shown that amla and some of its phytochemicals such as gallic acid, ellagic acid, pyrogallol, some norsesquiterpenoids, corilagin, geraniin, elaeocarpusin, and prodelphinidins B1 and B2 also possess antineoplastic effects. Amla is also reported to possess radiomodulatory, chemomodulatory, chemopreventive effects, free radical scavenging, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic and immunomodulatory activities, properties that are efficacious in the treatment and prevention of cancer. This review for the first time summarizes the results related to these properties and also emphasizes the aspects that warrant future research to establish its activity and utility as a cancer preventive and therapeutic drug in humans.",

      "abstract": "Amla (Emblica officinalis Gaertn.) is widely used in Indian medicine for the treatment of various diseases. We have investigated the effects of amla on the lipid metabolism and protein expression involved in oxidative stress during the ageing process. SunAmla or ethyl acetate extract of amla, a polyphenol-rich fraction, was administered at a dose of 40 or 10 mg/kg body weight per d for 100 d to young rats aged 2 months and aged rats aged 10 months. The lipid levels, such as cholesterol and TAG, in serum and liver were markedly elevated in aged control rats, while they were significantly decreased by the administration of amla. The PPARalpha is known to regulate the transcription of genes involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism. The PPARalpha protein level in liver was reduced in aged control rats. However, the oral administration of amla significantly increased the hepatic PPARalpha protein level. In addition, oral administration of amla significantly inhibited the serum and hepatic mitochondrial thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance levels in aged rats. Moreover, the elevated expression level of bax was significantly decreased after the oral administration of amla, while the level of bcl-2 led to a significant increase. Furthermore, the expressions of hepatic NF-kappaB, inducible NO synthase (iNOS), and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein levels were also increased with ageing. However, amla extract reduced the iNOS and COX-2 expression levels by inhibiting NF-kappaB activation in aged rats. These results indicate that amla may prevent age-related hyperlipidaemia through attenuating oxidative stress in the ageing process.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Previously, deletion 6p23 was generally reported in therapy-related secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as part of complex karyotypes. In this report, we present two young adult patients with de novo AML-M2 and a terminal deletion 6p23 as a sole primary abnormality, confirmed by chromosome 6 specific subtelomeric probes. METHODS: Two female patients 35 and 20 yr of age presented with anemia, but no bleeding, infections, lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. Morphological, immunophenotyping, chromosome and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed on bone marrow aspirate cells. RESULTS: A diagnosis of AML-M2 was confirmed in both patients by morphological and immunophenotyping studies. Chromosome analysis in case no. 1 showed deletion 6p23 in 20% of metaphases whereas in case no. 2 the deletion 6p23 was present in 100% metaphases. FISH analysis confirmed the deletion as terminal in both cases. The DEK oncogene at 6p23 in both cases was found not to be deleted. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, deletion 6p23 as a sole primary abnormality was reported in only one case. The common morphological, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic features in our two patients strongly support a separate new entity of de novo AML with deletion 6p23.",

The presence of Amla resulted in an enhanced cell survival, decreased free radical production and higher antioxidant levels similar to that of control cells. Further, chromium (VI) treatment resulted in decreased phagocytosis and gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN) production while Amla inhibited chromium induced immunosuppression and restored both phagocytosis and gamma-IFN production by macrophages significantly.",

      "abstract": "The fruits extracts of Emblica officinalis (Amla) has been reported to have strong anti-oxidant properties. There is a paucity of studies on the immunomodulatory properties of fruit extracts of Amla in immuno-compromised states, with the emphasis on lymphocytes. Therefore, the aim of the study was to determine the anti-oxidant and immunomodulatory properties of Amla using chromium (VI) as an immunosuppressive agent. Chromium (Cr) treatment results in enhanced cytotoxicity, free radical production, lipid peroxidation and decreased glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and diminished glutathione (GSH) levels. There was a significant inhibition of both lipopolysaccharide and concanavalin-A-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation. Chromium also inhibited Con A stimulated interleukin-2 and gamma-interferon production significantly. Further, there was enhanced apoptosis and DNA fragmentation in the presence of Cr. Amla significantly inhibited Cr-induced free radical production and restored the anti-oxidant status back to control level. Amla also inhibited apoptosis and DNA fragmentation induced by Cr. Interestingly, Amla relieved the immunosuppressive effects of Cr on lymphocyte proliferation and even restored the IL-2 and gamma-IFN production considerably.",

      "abstract": "Twelve trials of adjuvant immunotherapy in patients suffering from AML have been analyzed and compared to results from experimental studies. The analysis presents evidence suggesting that the immune response to leukemia cells exists in a state of balance; this appears to be regulated by the dose of antigen and the state of the cells used to immunize the patients. The injection of high doses of live allogeneic leukemia cells produced a significantly prolonged duration of the first remission in in AML patients. Immunization with high doses of irradiated and dead cells induced some prolongation of the remission phase and survival time, although the percentage of survivors after 3 years was not increased in these groups as compared to non-immunized patients. Immunization by the same route using a 100-fold lower amount of leukemia cells afforded no protection against relapse of the disease during the maintenance phase. A few patients even developed the relapse earlier than did patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Our understanding of the immune responses to malignant cells has increased considerably during the past 2 decades due to various observations. The results obtained with active immunotherapy of the AML patients during the same period agree well with experience from laboratory studies. Thus the results confirm the potential of an immunological interaction between the leukemia cells and the patient. Consequently, it seems likely that the addition of immunotherapy to the treatment of patients with AML might be effective and the tool for maintaining the phase of remission by up-to-date immunological engineering.",
