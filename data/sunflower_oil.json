      "abstract": "This study examined the effect of dietary Vachellia tortilis leaf meal and sunflower oil inclusion in supplementary diets on in vitro short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) and gas production and the in vivo growth performance of lambs. Four concentrate dietary treatments comprising control (CL), Vachellia tortilis leaf meal (VT), sunflower oil (SFO), and Vachellia tortilis leaf meal sunflower oil (VSFO) were formulated. Eight Merino lambs were blocked into two live weight blocks where animals within each block were randomly assigned to dietary treatments, making two animals per treatment. Lambs were offered a concentrate diet of 480 g/day per head, with urea-treated hay fed as a basal diet. Dietary effects were evaluated for in vitro short-chain fatty acid and gas production and 28-day growth performance of lambs over three study periods. The inclusion of VT and SFO showed no statistically significant effect on total SCFAs, acetate to propionate (A:P) ratio, methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2) production (p > 0.05), which might be attributable to low experimental units. The hourly A:P ratio and CH4 yield were the highest (p < 0.05) at 16 h of incubation. The inclusion of VT showed no statistically significant effect on growth performance and gas production due to the small sample size. Therefore, VT can be explored as a supplementary protein source in lamb diets given the impression of not showing any causative adverse effects on growth performance and in vitro gas production, although further research with larger sample sizes is needed to confirm these findings."

      "abstract": "The incidence of cognitive disorders is increasing globally, with a reported prevalence of over 50 million individuals affected, and current interventions offer limited efficacy. This study investigates the effects of sunflower oil fortified with sunflower lecithin, vitamin D, and vitamin A on scopolamine-induced cognitive dysfunction in mice and explores the underlying mechanisms. The incidence of cognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, is increasing yearly, and current interventions offer limited efficacy. Therefore, this research aims to evaluate the cognitive improvement effects of the three added functional factors on mice with learning and memory impairments, along with the associated molecular mechanisms. Behavioral tests, biochemical assays, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were utilized to examine the intervention effects of these functional factors on scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment in mice. The results revealed that the groups treated with sunflower lecithin and vitamin D significantly enhanced the mice's exploratory behavior, working memory, and spatial memory, with increases of 1.6 times and 4.5 times, respectively, in the open field and novel object recognition tests (VD group). Additionally, these treatments reduced levels of inflammatory markers and IL-6, increased antioxidant GSH levels, and decreased oxidative stress marker MDA levels, with all effects showing significant differences (p < 0.01). The effects were further enhanced when vitamin A was combined with these treatments. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that the intervention groups had markedly improved learning and memory abilities through upregulation of key gene expression levels in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, cholinergic pathway, and folate biosynthesis pathway. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the development of nutritionally fortified edible oils with added sunflower lecithin, vitamin D, and vitamin A, which may help prevent and ameliorate cognitive disorders.",

      "abstract": "Different oxidation states of oil affect the emulsion stablility and gel properties of emulsified meat products. Emulsified chicken gels were prepared using sunflower oil (SFO) with different oxidation levels (0, 20, 40, and 60 min, 120 °C). The pre-oxidation treatment of oils was investigated for emulsification and gelation of myofibrillar protein (MP). The results showed that MP emulsion gels with mildly oxidized (20 min) SFO had higher elastic modulus (G') and more homogeneous water distribution, which were due to increased hydrophobic interactions between MP and lipids, and improved emulsification stability. However, the addition of highly oxidized (60 min) SFO resulted in aggregation of proteins, increased emulsion particle size, significantly reduced hardness and chewiness (P > 0.05), and exhibited large pores in the network microstructure. The results suggested that mildly oxidized SFO has an ameliorating effect on MP emulsion gelation, which facilitates better comprehension of the protein oxidation process in oil-loaded meat systems.",

      "abstract": "In this study, the effect of high-power bath and horn ultrasound at different powers on specific surface area (S BET), total pore volume (V total), and average pore volume (D ave) of bleaching clay was examined. After subjecting the bleaching clay to ultrasonication treatment, the SBET values demonstrated an escalation from 31.4 ± 2.7 m2 g-1 to 59.8 ± 3.1 m2 g-1 for HU200BC, 143.8 ± 3.9 m2 g-1 for HU400BC, 54.4 ± 3.6 m2 g-1 for BU400BC, and 137.5 ± 2.8 m2 g-1 for BU800BC. The mean pore diameter (D ave) declined from 29.7 ± 0.14 nm in bleaching clay to 11.3 ± 0.13 nm in HU200BC, 8.3 ± 0.12 nm in HU400BC, 16.7 ± 0.14 nm in BU400BC, and 9.6 ± 0.12 nm in BU800BC. Therefore, horn ultrasound-treated bleaching clay significantly increased S BET and V total, indicating improved adsorption capacity. Moreover, to establish the relationship between bleaching parameters, seven multi-output ML regression models of Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multi-Task Lasso, Ridge regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Gradient Boosting are used, and compared with response surface methodology (RSM). ML has revolutionized the understanding of complex relationships between ultrasonic parameters, oil color, and pigment degradation, providing insights into how various factors such as temperature, ultrasonic power, and time can influence the bleaching process, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and precision of the treatment. The XGBoost model showed outstanding performance in predicting the target variables with a high R 2-train up to 1, R 2-test up to .983, and a minimum mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.498. The lower error between the predicted and experimental values implies the superiority of the XGBoost model to predict outcomes rather than RSM. It represents the suitability of bath ultrasound as a mild condition for low-pigmented oil bleaching. Finally, the Bayesian optimization method in conjunction with XGBoost was used to optimize the amount of bleaching clay and energy consumption, and its performance was compared with RSM. It was observed that the consumption of bleaching clay was reduced by approximately 60% for sunflower oil and 30%-35% for soybean oil."

This study investigated the effects of the heating rate (20-110 °C/min) and feedstock composition on phase repartition of the HTL products. HTL tests were carried out using as feedstocks cellulose, egg albumin, and sunflower oil as model compounds for carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids, alone and in binary mixtures. The biocrude, solid residue, and aqueous phase were characterized in terms of composition and elemental percentage. The effects of binary interactions were studied in terms of product yields and compositions. It was observed that higher heating rates resulted in lower solid yields from all the cellulose-containing feedstocks and, in most cases, in higher biocrude yields and higher energy recovery. The results showed that the heating rate influences also the oil composition. Biocrude and solid yields were compared with their prediction based on the combination of the yields of single model compounds, showing a general increase in biocrude yields and a decrease in solid yields. The most significant deviation is observed with the mixture cellulose-albumin both for the biocrude and solid yields. In fact, the main interactions were recognized for carbohydrate-protein mixtures followed by carbohydrate-lipid and protein-lipid mixtures."

      "abstract": "This study evaluated the effects of electrocoagulation integrated in a laboratory-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR), namely EC-MBR, on the treatment performance, activated sludge morphological characterization, and membrane fouling of MBR treating actual sunflower oil refinery wastewater. The EC-MBR system exhibited significantly higher chemical oxygen demand (COD) and oil and grease (O&G) removal efficiency compared to the MBR system. Additionally, both systems achieved excellent turbidity removal, with a percentage above 99%. The membrane fouling rate was higher in the EC-MBR system compared to the MBR system. Despite the decrease in the soluble microbial product (SMP) and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) concentration in the EC-MBR system, especially their protein fraction, the significant increase in MLSS and carbohydrates/protein ratio, and the decrease in the mixed liquor and the cake layer particles size were the main membrane fouling factors. The membrane fouling resistance distribution showed that the EC-MBR system had a higher percentage of pore blocking resistance compared to the MBR. FTIR analysis identified a greater proportion of carbohydrate compounds in the cake layer of the EC-MBR system. SEM images revealed dense microbial clusters, mainly rod- and oval-shaped bacteria, in the EC-MBR system. Furthermore, EDX analysis detected elements such as Ca, K, O, Al, and P in both systems, with the EC-MBR system showing a higher Al content. The EC-MBR system showed low energy consumption (0.431 kWh m-3) and total operating costs ($0.90 m-3), showcasing its effectiveness and affordability for sustainable wastewater management.",

Ozone is an option to enhance the standard treatment due to the wound-healing activity reported in the literature. In this study, we evaluated the efficiency of ozonated sunflower oil as an adjuvant in treating cutaneous lesions caused by Leishmania amazonensis. BALB/c mice were infected with L. amazonensis, and after the lesions appeared, they were treated in four different schedules using the drug treatment with meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime®), with or without ozonated oil. After thirty days of treatment, the lesions' thickness and their parasitic burden, blood leukocytes, production of NO and cytokines from peritoneal macrophages and lymph node cells were analyzed. The group treated with ozonated oil plus meglumine antimoniate showed the best performance, improving the lesion significantly. The parasitic burden showed that ozonated oil enhanced the leishmanicidal activity of the treatment, eliminating the parasites in the lesion. Besides, a decrease in the TNF levels from peritoneal macrophages and blood leukocytes demonstrated an immunomodulatory action of ozone in the ozonated oil-treated animals compared to the untreated group. Thus, ozonated sunflower oil therapy has been shown as an adjuvant in treating Leishmania lesions since this treatment enhanced the leishmanicidal and wound healing effects of meglumine antimoniate.",

However, there is limited research on the effectiveness of ozone for atopic dermatitis (AD). Ozonated sunflower oil (OSO) is an active ingredient obtained from partially ozonated sunflower oil (SO). OSO markedly reduced the LPS-induced increase in IL-1β and nitric oxide (NO) levels in RAW 264.7 mouse macrophage cells. Oxazolone (OXZ) was applied to hairless mice to induce AD-like skin symptoms and immune response. OSO significantly alleviated the OXZ-induced increases in the number of infiltrating mast cells, epidermal thickness, AD symptoms, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), and filaggrin, as well as the serum levels of NO, IgE, IL-1β, and TNF-α. Furthermore, OSO inhibited the IL-4/STAT3/MAPK pathway and the expression of NF-κB. Our results suggest that OSO treatment could relieve AD-mediated skin damage through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Therefore, it can be used as a therapeutic agent against AD-related skin diseases.",

Susceptibility assays were performed according to the broth microdilution protocol M38-A2/CLSI, and the minimal inhibitory (MIC) and minimal oomicidal (MOC) concentrations were also determined. Non-ozonated sunflower oil (SO) was used as the oil control. Additionally, kunkers from equine pythiosis were exposed to OSO. Damages caused by OSO and SO on P. insidiosum hyphae ultrastructure were verified using scanning electron microscopy. The MIC range for OSO was 7000 to 437.5 mg/mL, and the values for SO were higher, ranging from 56000 to 14000 mg/mL. The MOC was equal to MIC for both oil formulations. The OSO fully inhibited the oomycete growth from kunkers, although there was P. insidiosum growth in the kunker control in 24 h of incubation. The SEM analyses showed that both OSO and SO caused morphological alterations in P. insidiosum hyphae, highlighting the presence of cavitation along the hyphae with loss of continuity of the cell wall, which was more evident in the OSO-treated hyphae. The OSO had the best oomicidal activity, leading us to believe that our findings may support future research containing this formulation to be applied in integrative medicine protocols to control pythiosis in animals and humans.",

Conversely, the medicinal aspects of OSO for wound healing, tissue regeneration, and treatment of inflammation in dyslipidemia have yet to be fully elucidated. Herein, a comparative effect of OSO and sunflower oil (SO) was investigated to heal cutaneous wound and tissue regeneration of zebrafish impediment by carboxymethyllysine (CML) toxicity, following impact on hepatic inflammation and blood lipid profile. After OSO (final 2%, 1 μL) and SO's (final 2%, 1 μL) treatment, substantial healing was elicited by OSO in the cutaneous wound of zebrafish impaired by CML (final 25 μg). As an important event of wound healing, OSO scavenges the reactive oxygen species (ROS), rescues the wound from oxidative injury, and triggers the essential molecular events for the wound closer. Furthermore, the intraperitoneal injection of OSO was noted to counter the CML-induced adversity and prompt tissue regeneration in the amputated tail fin of zebrafish. Additionally, OSO counters the CML-induced neurotoxicity and rescues the zebrafish from acute mortality and paralysis, along with meticulous recovery of hepatic inflammation, fatty liver changes, and diminished ROS and proinflammatory interleukin (IL)-6 production. Moreover, OSO efficiently ameliorated CML-induced dyslipidemia by alleviating the total blood cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and increasing high-density lipoproteins cholesterol (HDL-C). The outcome of multivariate assessment employing principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis supports a superior therapeutic potential of OSO over SO against the clinical manifestation of CML. Conclusively, OSO owing to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential, counters CML-induced toxicity and promotes wound healing, tissue regeneration, hepatoprotection, improved blood lipid profile, and survivability of zebrafish."

However, studies on the effects of OSO on high-cholesterol diet (HCD)-induced metabolic disorders have been scarce. In the current study, we aimed to determine the anti-inflammatory effects of OSO on lipid metabolism in adult hypercholesterolemic zebrafish and its embryos. Microinjection of OSO (final 2%, 10 nL) into zebrafish embryos under the presence of carboxymethyllysine (CML, 500 ng) protected acute embryo death up to 61% survival, while sunflower oil (final 2%) showed much less protection at around 42% survival. The microinjection of OSO was more effective than SO to inhibit reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and apoptosis in the CML induced embryo toxicity. Intraperitoneal injection of OSO under the presence of CML protected acute death from CML-induced neurotoxicity with improved hepatic inflammation, less detection of ROS and interleukin (IL)-6, and lowering blood total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG), while the SO-injected group did not protect the CML-toxicity. Long-term supplementation of OSO (final 20%, wt/wt) with HCD for 6 months resulted in higher survivability than the HCD alone group or HCD + SO group (final 20%, wt/wt) with significant lowering of plasma TC and TG levels. The HCD + OSO group showed the least hepatic inflammation, fatty liver change, ROS, and IL-6 production. In conclusion, short-term treatment of OSO by injection exhibited potent anti-inflammatory activity against acute neurotoxicity of CML in zebrafish and their embryo. Long-term supplementation of OSO in the diet also revealed the highest survivability and blood lipid-lowering effect through potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity."

      "abstract": "Shrimp fried in vegetable oil is a very popular food, so it is important to study the changes in the quality of the oil during frying. In order to more precisely study the nature of frying oil during the cooking process, this study investigated the quality changes of high-oleic sunflower oil during the frying of South American white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). The oxidation and hydrolysis products of frying oils were investigated by integrating the proton nuclear magnetic resonance technique with traditional oil evaluation indexes in an integrated manner. The results showed that the color difference as measured using the ΔE* value increased gradually during the process. Moreover, the acid value, carbonyl value, and total oxidation significantly increased with prolonged frying time. The major oxidation products formed during frying were (E,E)-2-alkenals, (E,E)-2,4-alkadienals, and E,E-conjugated hydroperoxides. This indicated that longer treatment times corresponded with an increased accumulation of aldehydes and ketones, and an increased degree of oxidative deterioration of the oil. However, the proportion of oleic acid in the frying oil increased with the frying of shrimp, reaching 80.05% after 24 h. These results contribute to our understanding of the oxidative deterioration of high-oleic oils during frying, and provide an important reference for the application properties of high-oleic oils."

The aim of the present study was to clinically and immunologically evaluate the effect of ozonated oil on the healing of palatal wounds. METHODS: This is a prospective, longitudinal, triple-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The groups were divided as follows: Test group (n = 14): after removal of the free gingival graft (FGG), the palatal wound was treated with ozonized seed sunflower oil with a peroxide index between 510 and 625 meq O2 /kg; Control group (n = 14): after removal of the FGG, the palatal wound was treated with non-ozonated sunflower oil (placebo). The treatments were applied three times a day, for 7 days. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the measurements of wound area (mm2 ) between the test and control groups in the different periods evaluated (0, 3, 7, and 14 days; p > 0.05). The intra-group analysis showed a significant decrease in wound size over the course of days (0, 3, 7, and 14 days; p < 0.05). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; pg/mL) presented a significant reduction at 7 days (p < 0.05) compared to day 3 in the test group (p < 0.05). There was a statistical difference for malondialdehyde (MDA; pg/mL) in the test group between 3 and 7 days post-treatment (p < 0.05) and between test and control groups on the 7th day (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The application of highly ozonated sunflower oil did not improve the remaining scar area of the palate, decreasing the VEGF and increasing the oxidative stress marker MDA.",

To date, two long-term intervention studies have evaluated OPO’s health effects in comparison with high oleic sunflower oil (HOSO, study-1) and sunflower oil (SO, study-2) in healthy and cardiovascular risk subjects. The present study integrates the health effects observed with the three oils. Two randomized, blinded, cross-over controlled clinical trials were carried out in 65 normocholesterolemic and 67 moderately hypercholesterolemic subjects. Each study lasted fourteen weeks, with two four-week intervention phases (OPO versus HOSO or SO), each preceded by a three-week run-in or washout period. Regular OPO consumption reduced total cholesterol (p = 0.017) and LDL cholesterol (p = 0.018) levels as well as waist circumference (p = 0.026), and only within the healthy group did malondialdehyde (p = 0.004) levels decrease after OPO intake versus HOSO. Contrarily, after the SO intervention, apolipoprotein (Apo) B (p < 0.001) and Apo B/Apo A ratio (p < 0.001) increased, and to a lower extent Apo B increased with OPO. There were no differences between the study groups. OPO intake may improve cardiometabolic risk, particularly through reducing cholesterol-related parameters and waist circumference in healthy and hypercholesterolemic subjects."

Ultrasound-assisted extraction parameters were optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). Antioxidant and anticancer properties of total phenols were assessed. An SCF-CO2 co-solvent extract was nano-encapsulated and applied to sunflower oil without the addition of an antioxidant. The results indicated that the best treatment for retaining TPC and total flavonoids content (TFC) was SCF-CO2 co-solvent followed by the ultrasound and ethanolic extraction procedures. Additionally, the best antioxidant activity by β-carotene/linoleic acid and DPPH free radical-scavenging test systems was observed by SCF-CO2 co-solvent then ultrasound and ethanolic extraction methods. SCF-CO2 co-solvent recorded the highest inhibition % for PC3 (76.20%) and MCF7 (98.70%) and the lowest IC50 value for PC3 (145 µ/mL) and MCF7 (96 µ/mL). It was discovered that fortifying sunflower oil with SCF-CO2 co-solvent nanoparticles had a beneficial effect on free fatty acids and peroxide levels. The SCF-CO2 method was finally found to be superior and could be used in large-scale processing.",

There is strong evidence that dyslipidemia and other cardio-metabolic disorders are highly prevalent in patients with NAFLD. This trial aimed at examining the effect of sesame oil (SO) in the context of a weight loss program on lipid profile, blood pressure, and anthropometric indices in women with NAFLD. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was carried out on 60 women with NAFLD. Subjects were randomly assigned to the SO group (n = 30) and sunflower oil (SFO) group (n = 30), each person consuming 30 g of oil per day for 12 weeks. All the participants received a hypocaloric diet (- 500 kcal/day) during the study. Lipid profile, blood pressure, and anthropometric indices were assessed at pre- and post-intervention phases. RESULTS: In total, 53 participants completed the study. Following 12 weeks of intervention, anthropometric indices (p < 0.001) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) (p < 0.05) were significantly decreased in both groups and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was significantly decreased in So group (p = 0.03). There was no significant change in lipid profile in both groups (p > 0.05). After adjusting for confounders, DBP (p = 0.031) and total cholesterol (TC) divided by high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (p = 0.039) in the SO group were significantly reduced compared to the SFO group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The present clinical trial revealed that SO and SFO may not differently affect anthropometric indices, SBP, and lipid profile except for TC/HDL-C. In addition, SO may be effective in improvement of DBP and TC/HDL-C compared to the SFO group. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Ethical approval of this trial was obtained at Isfahan University of Medical Sciences with the reference number of IR.MUI. RESEARCH: REC.1399.548 ( https://ethics.

Nine Danish Landrace goats with 42 ± 5 days in milk were allocated to three treatment groups for 42 days. Animals received a basal diet, formulated with 85:15 forage:concentrate ratio, and the basal diet was supplemented with either rapeseed oil or sunflower oil at 4% of dry matter. Goat milk was sampled on days 14, 21, and 42. Milk composition was similar between treatments. From day 14 to day 42, milk yield increased (1.03 vs. 1.34 kg/d), while milk fat (2.72 vs. 1.82 g/d) and total solids (11.2 vs. 9.14 %) were reduced. Compared to control and rapeseed oil, sunflower decreased (P < 0.05) C4:0 (1.56, and 1.67 vs. 1.36 g/100 g) and both oils decreased (P < 0.05) C18:3n3 (0.60 vs. 0.20 and 0.10 g/100g). Rapeseed oil increased (P < 0.05) C18:2 cis9, trans11 compared to control and sunflower oil (0.37 vs. 0.13 and 0.19 g/100 g). Untargeted milk foodomics revealed slightly elevated (P < 0.05) gluconic acid and decreased hippuric acid (P < 0.05) in the milk of oil-fed goats compared to control. In vitro dry matter degradation (63.2 ± 0.02 %) was not affected by dietary treatments, while individual volatile fatty acid proportions, total volatile fatty acids (35.7 ± 2.44 mmol/l), CO2 (18.6 ± 1.15 mol), and CH4 (11.6 ± 1.16 mol) were not affected by dietary treatments. Sunflower oil and rapeseed oil decreased (P < 0.05) total gas production at 24 and 48 h compared with control. Overall, the use of sunflower oil or rapeseed oil at 4% DM inclusion did not compromise animal performance and milk composition."

This study investigated the effect of two different sources of unsaturated fatty acids, rapeseed oil and sunflower oil, as a feeding supplement on the milk foodome from dairy goats. Nine Danish Landrace goats at 42 ± 5 days in milk were allocated to three treatment groups for 42 days with three animals per group. A control group received a basal diet made of forage and concentrate at an 85:15 ratio. On top of the basal diet, the second and third groups received rapeseed oil or sunflower oil supplements at 4% of dry matter, respectively. Goat milk was sampled on days 14, 21, and 42. The milk foodome was measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The milk levels of 2-hydroxyisovaleric acid, oxaloacetic acid, and taurine were higher in the milk from goats fed with sunflower oil compared to the control group. More glucose-1-phosphate was found in the milk from goats fed with rapeseed oil compared to the control group. Amino acids, valine and tyrosine, and 2-hydroxyisovaleric acid and oxaloacetic acid were higher in the sunflower group compared to the rapeseed group, while the milk from the rapeseed-fed goats had greater levels of ethanol and 2-oxoglutaric acid compared to the sunflower group. Thus, results show that foodomics is suitable for studying how milk chemistry changes as a function of feeding regime."

      "abstract": "Vegetable oils (VOs), being our major dietary fat source, play a vital role in nourishment. Different VOs have highly contrasting fatty acid (FA) profiles and hence possess varying levels of health protectiveness. Consumption of a single VO cannot meet the recommended allowances of various FA either from saturated FA (SFA), monounsaturated FA (MUFA), polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), Ω-3 PUFAs, and medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs). Coconut oil (CO), flaxseed oil (FO), olive oil (OO), and sunflower oil (SFO) are among the top listed contrast VOs that are highly appreciated based on their rich contents of SFAs, Ω-3 PUFAs, MUFAs, and Ω-6 PUFA, respectively. Besides being protective against various disease biomarkers, these contrasting VOs are still inappropriate when consumed alone in 100% of daily fat recommendations. This review compiles the available data on blending of such contrasting VOs into single tailored blended oil (BO) with suitable FA composition to meet the recommended levels of SFA, MUFA, PUFA, MCTs, and Ω-3 to Ω-6 PUFA ratios which could ultimately serve as a cost-effective dietary intervention towards the health protectiveness and improvement of the whole population in general. The blending of any two or more VOs from CO, FO, OO, and SFO in the form of binary, ternary, or another type of blending was found to be very conclusive towards balancing FA composition; enhancing physiochemical and stability properties; and promising the therapeutic protectiveness of the resultant BOs.",

      "abstract": "Ozonated sunflower oil (OSO) has potent antimicrobial effects, making it useful for topical applications to treat various skin diseases. On the other hand, regarding mechanistic insight, the antioxidant activity and cytoprotective effects of OSO are relatively less known. The current study compared the antioxidant ability and protective ability of OSO on cells and embryos against oxidative stress, such as H2O2 and oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL), to investigate its potential applications for wound-healing and anti-infection. OSO showed potent radical scavenging activity and ferric ion reduction ability that was up to 35% and 42% stronger than sunflower oil (SO) as a control in a dose-dependent manner. Measurement of the wavelength-maximum fluorescence (WMF) of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) revealed different behavior between OSO and SO treatment (final 1-16%). The OSO treatment caused a 12 nm red shift of Trp movement from 345 nm (at 0%) to 357 nm (at 16%), while SO caused a 12 nm blue shift of Trp movement from 345 nm (at 0%) to 333 nm (at 16%). The fluorescence intensity of HDL3 was diminished remarkably by the OSO treatment by up to 80% from the initial level, while SO-treated HDL did not. OSO-treated HDL3 showed slower electromobility with stronger band intensity and bigger HDL particle sizes than those of SO-treated HDL3. The paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) activity of HDL3 was enhanced by a co-treatment of OSO that was up to 2.3 times higher than HDL3 alone in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the co-treatment of SO even inhibited the PON activity. The cell viability of RAW264.7 by the OSO treatment was 3.3 times higher than the SO treatment at a high dose range (from 10% to 50%, final). The OSO also exhibited more cytoprotective effects than SO in brain microglial cells in the presence of H2O2 (final 0.03%); treatment with OSO impeded apoptosis and reduced ROS production more than an SO treatment did. In the presence of H2O2 alone, 86 ± 5% of the embryos were killed by cell explosion after 24 h, but a co-treatment of OSO (final 4%) resulted in almost no embryo death (98% survivability). Injection of oxLDL (15 ng of protein) into zebrafish embryos caused acute death, while the co-injection of OSO (final 2%) resulted in 2.8 times higher survivability than oxLDL alone. These results suggest new effects of ozonated oil, such as enhanced antioxidant activity, more cytoprotective ability, and higher embryo protection against oxidative stress. These results may be useful in developing new methods for the quality control of ozonated oil and an assessment of its efficacy."

Acid-water-based degumming, bleaching, cooling, and heat treatment were performed to mimic the current refining process practices. Various oil extraction and refining scenarios were tested. MCPDE and total monochloropropane-diol (MCPD) content of the heat-treated samples were determined by liquid chromatography-HRMS and by an AOCS Official method. The results show that the oil produced from crop hulls and the bleaching clay used are the strongest chlorine sources boosting the MCPDE formation.

      "abstract": "The behaviour of high oleic sunflower oil in deep frying process of purple potato Purple Majesty has been evaluated simulating a fast food cooking process. This oil was used for 8h/day for 6 days, filling up from the 2nd day. A discontinuous and prolonged procedure was tested. Free Fatty Acidity (FFA), Peroxide Value (PV), Total Polar Compounds (TPC), Fatty Acid (FA) composition, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) have been determined at different times in thermo-oxidized (T-OX) oil, and in frying oil. The FFA in T-OX oil samples showed values in the range 0.09%-0.24%, whereas in the frying oil values varied in a range between 0.09% and 0.16%. TPCs values varied from 1.76% to 38.24% in T-OX oils, whereas in frying oil used for frying purple potatoes (FOPP) showed values in the range from 1.76 to 29.13%. The peroxides values did not follow a regular pattern, both during thermo-oxidation and during frying. Among the Long Chain Fatty Acids (LCFAs), oleic acid was the most represented (84.13%). Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) amount was 0.34% (octanoic acid). Medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) amount was 4.45% (palmitic acid). During the thermo-oxidation, the poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) amount decreased during the 48 h of heat treatment, reaching an amount of 6.21%. This determined the increase in short chain fatty acids (SCFA). Trans fatty acids increased with the frying time. Unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) reached the value of 90.19%; SFA was 9.79%, and octanoic acid was 0.20%. A correlation between TPC vs UFA/SFA and TPC vs C18:2/C16:0 was observed in the frying oil. The most abundant volatile compounds in frying oil (from 0 to 48 h) were the aldehydes produced by decomposition of hydroperoxides of oleic and linoleic acids."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Natural products are valuable sources of nutraceuticals for the prevention or treatment of ischemic stroke, a major cause of death and severe disability worldwide. Among the mechanisms implicated in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion damage, oxidative stress exerts a pivotal role in disease progression. Given the high antioxidant potential of most components of sunflower oil, we have explored its effects on ischemic brain injury produced in the mouse by transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAo). KEY FINDINGS: Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of sunflower oil at doses of 3 ml/kg (48 h, 24 h and 1 h before MCAo) significantly reduced brain infarct volume and oedema assessed 24 h after the insult. This neuroprotective treatment schedule also prevented the elevation of brain lipid peroxidation produced by MCAo-reperfusion injury. By contrast, doses of 0.03 ml/kg of sunflower oil resulted ineffective on both cerebral damage and lipid peroxidation. Although sunflower oil did not affect serum levels of Diacron-reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs), both 0.03 and 3 ml/kg dosing regimens resulted in the preservation of serum biological antioxidant potential (BAP) that was otherwise dramatically reduced 24 h after MCAo. CONCLUSIONS: Sunflower oil represents a promising source of neuroprotective extracts/compounds that can be exploited for the prevention and/or treatment of cerebral ischemia.",

It is often associated with dyslipidemia and other risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). This study was aimed to evaluate dietary intervention effects with canola and olive oils compared to sunflower oil on lipid profile and fatty liver severity among women with PCOS. METHOD: This study was a 10-week intervention including 72 women with PCOS. Patients were randomly assigned to three groups for receiving 25 g/day canola, olive, or sunflower oils for 10 weeks. The primary and secondary outcomes were to assess changes in lipid profile and in fatty liver severity, respectively. RESULT: At the end of the study, 72 patients with a mean age of 29.31 were analysed. Canola oil consumption resulted in a significant reduction in serum levels of TG (P = 0.002) and TC/HDL (P = 0.021), LDL/HDL (P = 0.047), and TG/HDL (P = 0.001) ratios, however, there was no significant reduction in lipid profile following olive oil consumption. Canola (P < 0.001) and olive oils (P = 0.005) could significantly reduce the fatty liver grade. Moreover, HOMA-IR in both canola (P < 0.001) and olive (P = 0.004) groups was significantly decreased. CONCLUSION: In total, compared to olive and sunflower oils, significant improvements in lipid profile, liver function, and HOMA-IR were observed following canola oil consumption in women with PCOS.

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of biodegradable packages made with chickpea flour on the oxidation of sunflower oil. Chickpea flour films were prepared using the casting technique. To study the influence of storage time on films properties, the chickpea flour films were stored during 60 days at 25 °C and 52% relative humidity. In addition, sunflower oil samples were packaged in chickpea flour packages (CPs) and stored for 60 days at 25 °C. Lipid oxidation indicators were evaluated. The results showed that puncture force and redness values (a*) of chickpea films did not change significantly during storage. Tensile strength, Young's modulus (YM), and yellowness (b*) increased and moisture content (MC), elongation (%E), solubility (%S), water vapor permeability (WVP), and luminosity (L*) decreased. Microscopic images showed the presence of a few cracks in the film network at storage day 60. Conjugated dienes and peroxide value increased less for sunflower oil stored in high-barrier plastic pouches and CPs during storage than the control treatment. CPs helped to preserve the chemical quality of sunflower oil samples, proving to be a promising alternative to develop biodegradable packaging to be used in oily food preservation. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Discarded chickpea grains are those split and different color grains that are separated from marketable grains, and represent an industrial byproduct. These grains are currently used for feed, constituting a nutritive biomass of low commercial value. Chickpea flour is a potential material for making biodegradable films. This strategy allows adding value to the chickpea industry, transforming a byproduct into a raw material with the potential to develop economical food packaging material. The use of chickpea packages to preserve sunflower oil may be an alternative to pack vegetable oil or high lipid content food, allowing the use reduction of nonbiodegradable pouches.",

      "abstract": "Deep-fat frying is an important process used worldwide for the preparation of foods. Due to oxidation, hydrolysis, decomposition and oligomerization, numerous polar compounds are formed. These compounds change the physical, nutritional and sensory properties of the oil or fat. The standard methods of the German Society for Fat Science for the assessment of the quality of frying fats are time consuming and cost intensive. Therefore, alternative cost-effective and sensitive rapid methods, which ideally allow the quantitative determination of the quality of frying fats \"in-line\" in the deep-frying pan are needed. Sunflower oil and palm fat were thermally and oxidatively degraded in a beaker at atmospheric pressure under intensive stirring for 76 h at 175 °C. To evaluate the development of the physical properties during heat treatment, the viscosity and dielectric constant of these oils were measured. The temperature in a deep-frying pan can vary within a wide range (160-190 °C), and the viscosity and dielectric constant show a strong temperature dependence. Therefore, it was necessary to measure the temperature dependence of the viscosity and dielectric constant of the different degraded oils. Additionally, their chemical properties were characterized by high-performance gel permeation chromatography and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The determination of the dielectric constant, which is directly correlated with the concentration of polar compounds, seems to be the best method for the assessment of the quality of used frying oils."

The effect of applied current density, pH/H2O2 dosage, and operation time in the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD), soluble COD, total organic carbon, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were studied using Box Behnken Design. In EC process, decrease in organic concentration was observed as the time and current density increased. The optimized conditions for EC process were achieved at pH 6.07 when a current density of 5.69 mA cm-2 was applied for 18 min. The EO removed about 90% of DOC at an optimized pH of 5.27 and current density of 11.56 mA cm-2 when operated for 400 min. The combined EC + EO process was successful compare to ECP process in removing between 90 and 95% of organic pollutant from the sunflower oil refinery wastewater. The energy consumption was calculated to compare between the process efficiency of EC + EO and ECP and found that EC + EO was more efficient process.

The current study aimed to compare the effects of flaxseed oil and sunflower oil consumption on the coagulation score and selected oxidative and inflammatory parameters in patients with MetS. In this randomized controlled clinical trial, 60 patients with MetS were allocated into 2 groups. One group received 25 mL/day flaxseed oil and the other group received 25 mL/day sunflower oil for 7 weeks. Maintenance diet including 15% protein, 55% carbohydrate, and 30% fat from daily total energy intake was designed for each participant. Serum levels of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), as well as coagulation score were measured before and after the intervention. Three 24-hour food records were taken during the study. Fifty-two of participants (27 in sunflower oil and 25 in flaxseed oil groups) completed the study. The baseline characteristics and dietary intakes were similar between patients. After 7 weeks, no significant difference was observed between the 2 groups regarding the serum TAC level and coagulation score (p > 0.05). However, serum IL-6 levels significantly decreased in the flaxseed oil group compared to the sunflower oil group (p = 0.017). No side effect was observed during the study due to the use of sunflower and flaxseed oils. We observed that consumption of flaxseed oil improved serum IL-6 levels but had no effect on oxidative stress and coagulation score in patients with MetS. Further studies are needed to confirm the veracity of our results. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials Identifier: IRCT2015012020737N1."

      "abstract": "In 2011, Tanzania mandated the fortification of edible oil with vitamin A to help address its vitamin A deficiency (VAD) public health problem. By 2015, only 16% of edible oil met the standards for adequate fortification. There is no evidence on the cost-effectiveness of the fortification of edible oil by small- and medium-scale (SMS) producers in preventing VAD. The MASAVA project initiated the production of sunflower oil fortified with vitamin A by SMS producers in the Manyara and Shinyanga regions of Tanzania. A quasi-experimental nonequivalent control-group research trial and an economic evaluation were conducted. The household survey included mother and child pairs from a sample of 568 households before the intervention and 18 months later. From the social perspective, the incremental cost of fortification of sunflower oil could be as low as $0.13, $0.06, and $0.02 per litre for small-, medium-, and large-scale producers, respectively, compared with unfortified sunflower oil. The SMS intervention increased access to fortified oil for some vulnerable groups but did not have a significant effect on the prevention of VAD due to insufficient coverage. Fortification of vegetable oil by large-scale producers was associated with a significant reduction of VAD in children from Shinyanga. The estimated cost per disability-adjusted life year averted for fortified sunflower oil was $281 for large-scale and could be as low as $626 for medium-scale and $1,507 for small-scale producers under ideal conditions. According to the World Health Organization thresholds, this intervention is very cost-effective for large- and medium-scale producers and cost-effective for small-scale producers.",

Evidence suggests that longevity is inversely related to unsaturation of membrane phospholipids. This study investigated how different unsaturated dietary fats affect life span and cause of death in male Wistar rats fed diets based on virgin olive oil (V), sunflower oil (S), or fish oil (F), which were supplemented or not with Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). Previous results suggest that individual longevity and survival probability at different ages may be modulated by an appropriate dietary fat treatment. Lifelong feeding with V or F diets would reduce death probability compared to feeding with S diet at certain ages, although the effects of V diet would be maintained for most of life. Furthermore, the addition of lower amounts of CoQ10 reduced mortality associated with S diet, but CoQ10 had no effect on survival when combined with virgin olive oil or fish oil. Supplementation with low doses of CoQ10 failed to increase the maximum life span potential of rats fed a V or F diet. No clear evidence showing that monounsaturated fatty acids, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, or CoQ10 exerted the observed effects by modulating the rate of aging has been found.",

      "abstract": "Milk and its derivatives are important foods that contribute to daily nutrient requirements and improve consumers' health. This study evaluated the effects of supplementing the diet of lactating dairy cows with sunflower oil (SFO), selenium, and vitamin E on the milk's fatty acid profile and fat oxidative stability as well as the acceptability of the milk by consumers. For this purpose, 32 Jersey dairy cows were allocated to four treatment groups for 60 days, as follows: C (control diet); A (3.5 mg/kg DM (dry matter) organic selenium + 2000 IU vitamin E/cow per day); O (4% SFO DM); OA (equal doses of A and O treatments). The inclusion of SFO decreased the contents of 10:0, 10:1, 11:0, 12:0, 12:1, 14:0, and 9c-14:1 fatty acids as well as odd- and branched-chain fatty acids (13:0, iso 13:0, anteiso 13:0, 15:0, iso 15:0, and 17:0). There was also a tendency for 8:0 and 16:0 fatty acid concentrations to decrease when SFO was included in the cows´ diet. SFO decreased the concentration of 10:0 to 15:0 fatty acids in milk. The sum of the conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs), conjugated alpha-linolenic acid intermediates (CLnAs; 18:3 ω6 + 18:3 ω3), and 22:0 fatty acids in milk tended to increase, and there were significant increases in 18:0 and 9c11t-18:2 with SFO. In terms of the effects of SFO on the health-related lipid indices, the atherogenicity index tended to decrease and h/H tended to increase. When cows were supplemented with antioxidants, the concentration of 20:2 fatty acids decreased, the 6 + 7 + 8 + 9t-18:1, 16t-18:1, 20:0, 22:2, and 24:0 fatty acid concentrations increased, and there was a trend for the 22:1 ω9 fatty acid concentration to increase with antioxidants plus oil. There was a tendency for ω6 fatty acids and ω6/ω3 to increase with milk treated with antioxidants plus oil. The oxidative stability of milk was not influenced by the presence of SFO or antioxidants in the diet of dairy cows. Consumers desired the color and mouthfeel of the milk that was treated with SFO. Cows fed with 4% sunflower oil produced milk with an improved fatty acid profile for human nutrition, containing a higher CLA content and an improved ratio of hypocholesterolemic and hypercholesterolemic fatty acids, without increasing the milk's susceptibility to oxidation. The milk was also rated as being more acceptable by consumers.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effect of the inclusion of sunflower oil (SF) and quebracho tannin (QT) in a sheep diet was evaluated. Nutrient digestibility and nitrogen (N) utilization, as well as in vitro ruminal degradation kinetics, were evaluated at three levels [0, 20 and 40 g kg-1 of diet dry matter] of SF and QT in a 32 arrangement. The treatments were 0 (control); 20 and 40 g of QT and/or SF kg-1 of the diet. Four intact male sheep (45 ± 1.3 kg) for each treatment were used in the digestibility trial and kept individually in metabolic cages. RESULTS: Nutrient digestibility and N balance were not affected by SF. However, QT at 40 g kg-1 of dry matter decreased (P < 0.05) nutrient digestibility and also increased the proportion of absorbed N. Both SF and QT reduced (P < 0.05) the slowly degraded fraction and rate for organic matter and N. Even though the QT had a negative (P < 0.05) effect on nutrient digestibility, this effect was mild (P > 0.05) when SF was included in the QT-added diets. Moreover, an interaction (P < 0.05) of SF × QT was observed on the synchronization index as an indicator of the efficiency of rumen microbial protein synthesis. CONCLUSION: Supplementation of either SF or QT to sheep diets reduced ruminal organic matter and N degradability, reflecting the compensatory digestion in the post-ruminal track for organic matter feed utilization. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.",

The massage was performed three times per day, each session including three consecutive five-minute stages, for five days. The primary outcome was to evaluate the efficacy of a short course of moderate pressure sunflower oil massage on the weight gain velocity. The secondary outcome was to compare the length of NICU stay between the two groups. RESULTS: During the study period, the increase in the average daily and fifth-day weight gain was significant in the intervention group. The length of NICU stay was shorter in the intervention group significantly. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that even a short course of body massage with sunflower oil for only five days increases preterm infants' weight gain and decreases their duration of NICU stay significantly.",

STUDY DESIGN: In this double-blind pilot study, thirty-eight patients with defined RA were allocated to consume foods enriched with microalgae oil from Schizochytrium sp. (2.1 g DHA/d) or sunflower oil (placebo) for 10 weeks (cross-over), maintaining the regular RA medication during the study. RESULTS: In contrast to placebo, the daily consumption of DHA led to a decline in the sum of tender and swollen joints (68/66) from 13.9 ± 7.4 to 9.9 ± 7.0 (p = 0.010), total DAS28 from 4.3 ± 1.0 to 3.9 ± 1.2 (p = 0.072), and ultrasound score (US-7) from 15.1 ± 9.5 to 12.4 ± 7.0 (p = 0.160). The consumption of placebo products caused an increase of the n-6 PUFA linoleic acid and arachidonic acid (AA) in erythrocyte lipids (EL, p < 0.05). The amount of DHA was doubled in EL of DHA-supplemented patients and the ratios of AA/EPA and AA/DHA dropped significantly. We speculate that the production of pro-inflammatory/non-resolving AA-derived eicosanoids might decrease in relation to anti-inflammatory/pro-resolving DHA- and EPA-derived lipid mediators. In fact, plasma concentrations of AA-derived thromboxane B2 and the capacity of blood to convert AA to the pro-inflammatory 5-lipoxygenase product 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid were significantly reduced, while levels of the DHA-derived maresin/resolvin precursors 14-/17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid significantly increased due to DHA supplementation. CONCLUSION: The study shows for the first time that supplemented microalgae DHA ameliorates disease activity in patients with RA along with a shift in the balance of AA- and DHA-derived lipid mediators towards an anti-inflammatory/pro-resolving state.",

We aimed to compare the effects of CO and RBO consumption on blood lipids in women with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Seventy-five postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes participated in this single-center, randomized, controlled, parallel-group trial in Shiraz, Iran. Participants were randomly allocated to three groups including a control group (balance diet + 30 g/d sunflower oil) and two intervention groups (balance diet + 30 g/day CO or RBO). At baseline and after 8 weeks, serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were measured. RESULTS: At 8 weeks, mean of serum levels of TG (mg/dL), TC (mg/dL), and LDL-C (mg/dL) significantly decreased in the CO group (-23.66, P < .001; -11.92, P < .001; and -6.33, P = .013, respectively) and RBO group (-38.62, P < .001; -17.25, P < .001; and -8.90, P = .002, respectively) compared with the controls (7.01, 4.06, and 2.90, respectively). Also, in comparison with CO group, the changes of TG, LDL-C, and non-HDL-C levels were significantly more in the RBO group (P = .007, P = .012, and P = .011, respectively). Levels of serum HDL-C remained unchanged in all groups at the end of study. CONCLUSIONS: Substitution of RBO or CO for sunflower oil could attenuate lipid disorders in type 2 diabetes women. Moreover, RBO could improve lipid profile more efficiently than CO.",

Nowadays, these types of procedures have been abandoned by health professionals due to late onset of serious complications. However, it is still misused by some subcultures such as bodybuilders, passive homosexuals, transsexuals, and patients with mental illness. This article discusses a male patient who injected himself with a large amount of sunflower oil, which became complicated by an inflammatory response-abscess formation and sclerosing lipogranuloma of breasts. The radiologic and pathologic signs of this entity are discussed with a review of the relevant literature. Lack of suspicion of this entity may cause a great delay in establishment of definitive diagnosis, giving rise to prominent morbidity and mortality. It is necessary to know the diagnosis and treatment of this phenomenon because illegal substances that cause factitial panniculitis are widely available on websites and threaten thousands of people, which is anecdotally referred in medical literature. Chronic or recurrent lesions of a bizarre or atypical morphology should alert the physician to this artificial phenomenon. Radiologic findings are most important criteria for diagnosis because self-injection is denied by the patient."

In addition, to evaluate the effect of water washing process on the quality of used frying oil and the treated oil. The metal patterns of sugar cane bagasse ash and Magnesol XL were determined. Some physical and chemical properties of unused, used frying and used-treated sunflower oil were determined. Sunflower oil sample was heated at 180 °C + 5 °C, then frozen French fries potato were fried every 30 min. during a continuous period of 20 h. Oil samples were taken every 4 h. The filter aids were added individually to the used frying oil at levels 1, 2 and 3 % (w / v), then mechanically stirred for 60 min at 105 °C. The results indicate that all the filter aids under study were characterized by high levels of Si and variable levels of other minerals. The highest level of Si was recorded for sugar cane bagasse ash (SCBA) was 76.79 wt. %. Frying process caused significant (P ≤ 0.05) increases in physico-chemical properties of sunflower oil. The treatments of used frying sunflower oil with different levels of sugar cane bagasse ash and Magnesol XL caused significant (P ≤ 0.05) increase in the quality of treated oil, however the soap content of treated oil was increased, therefore, the effect of water washing process on the quality of used frying and used-treated sunflower oil was evaluated. The values of soap and Total polar compounds after water treatment were about 4.62 and 7.27 times as low as that for sunflower oil treated with 3 % sugar cane bagasse ash (SCBA). The results of the present study indicate that filtration treatment with different levels of sugar cane bagasse ash( SCBA) regenerated the quality of used sunflower oil and possess higher adsorbing effects than the synthetic filter aid ( Magnesol XL ) in removing oil oxidation products. The current study also recommends using hot water treatment for improving the quality of used frying oil."

      "abstract": "High-performance barrier films preventing permeation of moisture, aggressive chloride ions, and corrosive acids are important for many industries ranging from food to aviation. In the current study, pristine sunflower oil was used to form uniform adherent films on iron (Fe) via a simple single-step thermal treatment (without involving any initiator/mediator/catalyst). Oxidation of oil on heating results in a highly conjugated (oxidized) crystalline lamellar network with interlayer separation of 0.445 nm on Fe. The electrochemical corrosion tests proved that the coating exhibits superior anticorrosion performance with high coating resistance (>10(9) ohm cm2) and low capacitance values (<10(-10) F cm(-2)) as compared to bare Fe, graphene, and conducting polymer based coatings in 1 M hydrochloric acid solutions. The electrochemical analyses reveal that the oil coatings developed in this study provided a two-fold protection of passivation from the oxide layer and barrier from polymeric films. It is clearly observed that there is no change in structure, morphology, or electrochemical properties even after a prolonged exposure time of 80 days. This work indicates the prospect of developing highly inert, environmentally green, nontoxic, and micrometer level passivating barrier coatings from more sustainable and renewable sources, which can be of interest for numerous applications."

Two groups of samples were used. One group was analyzed at room temperature (25°C) and the other group was thermally treated in a thermostatic water bath at 75°C for 8h, in contact with air and with light exposure, to favor oxidation. All samples were then measured with synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy. Fluorescence spectra were acquired by varying the excitation wavelength in the region from 250 to 720nm. In order to optimize the differences between excitation and emission wavelengths, four constant differential wavelengths, i.e., 20nm, 40nm, 60nm and 80nm, were tried. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used to discriminate between pure and adulterated oils. It was found that the 20nm difference was the optimal, at which the discrimination models showed the best results. The best PLS-DA models were those built with the difference spectra (75-25°C), which were able to discriminate pure from adulterated oils at a 2% level of adulteration. Furthermore, PLS regression models were built to quantify the level of adulteration. Again, the best model was the one built with the difference spectra, with a prediction error of 1.75% of adulteration.",

The objective of this work was to assess the oxidation susceptibility of equal amounts of cholesterol and stigmasterol within a sunflower oil lipid matrix (ratio 1:1:200) during heating (180°C, 0-180min). Remaining percentage of sterols was determined and seven sterol oxidation products (SOPs) were analysed for each type of sterol along the heating treatment. Evolution of the fatty acid profile and vitamin E content of the oil was also studied. Overall oxidation status of the model system was assessed by means of Peroxides Value (PV) and TBARS. PV remained constant from 30min onwards and TBARS continued increasing along the whole heating treatment. Degradation of both cholesterol and stigmasterol fitted a first order curve (R(2)=0.937 and 0.883, respectively), with very similar degradation constants (0.004min(-1) and 0.005min(-1), respectively). However, higher concentrations of oxidation products were found from cholesterol (79μg/mg) than from stigmasterol (53μg/mg) at the end of the heating treatment. Profile of individual oxidation products was similar for both sterols, except for the fact that no 25-hydroxystigmasterol was detected. 7α-Hydroxy and 7-keto-derivatives were the most abundant SOPs at the end of the treatment. PUFA and vitamin E suffered a significant degradation along the process, which was correlated to sterols oxidation.",

However, it is not clear which type of oil has the most pronounced effect, especially not in paediatric patients. The aim was to compare two low-fat diet regimes enriched with either monounsaturated fatty acids by rapeseed oil (RO) or polyunsaturated fatty acids by sunflower oil (SO) in children affected with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). SUBJECTS/METHODS: Twenty-one children aged 6-18 years affected with FH were enrolled in this randomized and double-blind pilot trial. The subjects and their families were trained to adhere to a low-fat/low-cholesterol diet. All visible fats were to be replaced by either RO or SO (14-27 g/day) for 13 weeks. Dietary adherence was controlled by repeated 4-day dietary records; plasma lipids, lipoproteins and risk markers were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Out of 21 subjects, 16 could be followed-up after 6 months. RESULTS: Both fat-modified diets resulted in significant reduction in total cholesterol concentrations of 9.4% (RO P<0.005 vs SO P<0.05) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations of 12.7% (P<0.005) for RO and 11.3% (P<0.05) for SO. The reduction of the LDL/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio (RO 9% vs SO 3.5%) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (RO 16.8% vs SO 1.7%) were not statistically significant, respectively. In most participating families, a change in eating habits could be observed. CONCLUSIONS: A fat-modified diet enriched with RO seems to have very similar effects on cholesterol levels as with SO. However, our study suggests that RO has possibly more favourable effects concerning cardiovascular risk profile. Both diets appear to be feasible and were well accepted among our subjects. Although these results are promising, larger trials will be required to validate our findings.",

      "abstract": "An innovative ex situ soil washing technology was developed to remediate polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and heavy metals in an electronic waste site. Elevated temperature (50 °C) in combination with ultrasonication (40 kHz, 20 min) at 5.0 mL L(-1) sunflower oil and 2.5 g L(-1) carboxymethyl chitosan were found to be effective in extracting mixed pollutants from soil. After two successive washing cycles, the removal efficiency rates for total PBDEs, BDE28, BDE47, BDE209, Pb, and Cd were approximately 94.1, 93.4, 94.3, 99.1, 89.3, and 92.7 %, respectively. Treating the second washed soil with PBDE-degrading bacteria (Rhodococcus sp. strain RHA1) inoculation and nutrient addition for 3 months led to maximum biodegradation rates of 37.3, 52.6, 23.9, and 1.3 % of the remaining total PBDEs, BDE28, BDE47, BDE209, respectively. After the combined treatment, the microbiological functions of washed soil was partially restored, as indicated by a significant increase in the counts, biomass C, N, and functioning diversity of soil microorganisms (p < 0.05), and the residual PBDEs and heavy metals mainly existed as very slow desorbing fractions and residual fractions, as evaluated by Tenax extraction combined with a first-three-compartment model and sequential extraction with metal stability indices (I R and U ts). Additionally, the secondary environmental risk of mixed contaminants in the remediated soil was limited. Therefore, the proposed combined cleanup strategy is an environment-friendly technology that is important for risk assessment and management in mixed-contaminated sites.",

The thermal treatment produces small particles of CaCO3 and CaO that are responsible for the catalytic activity. The conversion from triglycerides to methyl ester was not observed in transesterification carried out using natural crab shell and eggshell. Under optimized reaction conditions, the conversions to YFAME using the calcined catalysts were: crab shell (83.10±0.27 wt.%) and eggshell (97.75±0.02 wt.%).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Aging enhances frequency of chronic diseases like cardiovascular diseases or periodontitis. Here we reproduced an age-dependent model of the periodontium, a fully physiological approach to periodontal conditions, to evaluate the impact of dietary fat type on gingival tissue of young (6 months old) and old (24 months old) rats. METHODS/FINDINGS: Animals were fed life-long on diets based on monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) as virgin olive oil, n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6PUFA), as sunflower oil, or n-3PUFA, as fish oil. Age-related alveolar bone loss was higher in n-6PUFA fed rats, probably as a consequence of the ablation of the cell capacity to adapt to aging. Gene expression analysis suggests that MUFA or n-3PUFA allowed mitochondria to maintain an adequate turnover through induction of biogenesis, autophagy and the antioxidant systems, and avoiding mitochondrial electron transport system alterations. CONCLUSIONS: The main finding is that the enhanced alveolar bone loss associated to age may be targeted by an appropriate dietary treatment. The mechanisms involved in this phenomenon are related with an ablation of the cell capacity to adapt to aging. Thus, MUFA or n-3PUFA might allow mitochondrial maintaining turnover through biogenesis or autophagy. They might also be able to induce the corresponding antioxidant systems to counteract age-related oxidative stress, and do not inhibit mitochondrial electron transport chain. From the nutritional and clinical point of view, it is noteworthy that the potential treatments to attenuate alveolar bone loss (a feature of periodontal disease) associated to age could be similar to some of the proposed for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, a group of pathologies recently associated with age-related periodontitis.",

Dietary n-6 is known to weaken the efficacy of n-3 fatty acids due to competition for the same enzymes. Still unclear is whether a similar competition exists between n-3 and n-9 fatty acids. Thus, a 12-week intervention study was conducted to investigate the effect of different combinations of fish oil and high-oleic sunflower oil (OSO) on healthy subjects. Included were five groups (98 subjects): three groups received a fixed amount of n-9 (8 g/day) with varying amounts of n-3 (1, 2 or 4 g/day), one group was given n-3 fatty acids only (2 g/day) and another was given n-9 only (8 g/day). We found that fish oil supplement (2 g/day) was able to decrease TAG by about 13 %, this effect was diminished with the co-ingestion of n-9 (OSO). Intake of OSO (8 g/day) reduced both total and LDL cholesterol by about 10 %, this effect was reduced by the addition of fish oil. Both fish oil and OSO failed to have any significant effect on both glycemic and blood pressure parameters. In conclusion; the impact of oleic acid (n-9) on total and LDL cholesterol was altered by the addition fish oil (n-3). These effects may have been the result of enzymatic competition between the two types of fatty acids.",

AIMS: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of body massage with and without sunflower oil on the growth of LBW preterm neonates in Iran. STUDY DESIGN: A single-blinded randomized clinical trial SUBJECTS: This study examined neonates admitted to NICU with gestational age of 33-37 weeks and birth weight of 1500-1999 g, without birth asphyxia and medically stable OUTCOME MEASURES: Neonates were randomly assigned to two groups to receive moderate pressure massage alone or the same massage with sunflower oil by their mothers, three times a day for 14 consecutive days. The primary variables were increases in mean of growth parameters (weight, height and head circumference) that were evaluated 14 days after intervention, at ages 1 and 2 months. Secondary variables were clinical side effects. RESULTS: Fifty-four neonates including 25 girls and 29 boys with mean gestational age of 35.3 ± 1.26 weeks were evaluated. Means of gestational age, birth weight and length of NICU stay were not different in both groups. In the oil massage group, mean weight at ages 1 month (mean ± SD: 2339 ± 135 vs. 2201 ± 93 g, P = 0.04) and 2 months (mean ± SD: 3301 ± 237 vs. 3005 ± 305 g, P = 0.005) was significantly greater than that of the body massage group. No adverse events were seen in the two groups. CONCLUSION: Sunflower oil massage might be used as an effective and safe intervention for weight gain in LBW preterm neonates.",

Eighteen pigs (17-19 kg body weight) received one of three experimental diets for 60 days (six animals per group): (i) Control diet; (ii) a diet with sunflower oil (SO) or (iii) a diet with coconut oil (CO). In diets SO and CO, 10% of the feed energy was replaced by the respective oils. The experimental treatment did not influence the performance of the pigs. In blood serum, an increased content of total cholesterol was observed for SO and CO fed animals, whereas no significant changes for total triglycerides and different lipoprotein fractions were detected. The fatty acid composition of adipose tissue was significantly modified, with an increased content of MCFA and n-6 PUFA in CO and SO fed pigs, respectively. The gene expression for fatty acid synthase was decreased for SO and CO fed pigs; for stearoyl CoA desaturase and sterol regulatory element binding protein, a depression was observed in SO but not in CO fed pigs. The results of present study suggest that the type of dietary fat can modulate the adipose tissue gene expression and fatty acid composition differentially, with minimal effect on serum lipid profile.",

For the anaerobic digestion of SuOC three different industrial reactors were compared as inoculum sources. This was done using a biochemical methane production (BMP) test. Inoculum I was a granular biomass from an industrial reactor treating soft-drink wastewaters. Inoculum II was a flocculent biomass from a full-scale reactor treating biosolids generated in an urban wastewater treatment plant. Inoculum III was a granular biomass from an industrial reactor treating brewery wastes. The highest kinetic constant for methane production was achieved using inoculum II. The inoculum sources were analyzed through PCR amplification of 16S rRNA genes and fingerprinting before (t = 0) and after the BMP test (t = 12 days). No significant differences were found in the bacterial community fingerprints between the beginning and the end of the experiments. The bacterial and archaeal communities of inoculum II were further analyzed. The main bacteria found in this inoculum belong to Alphaproteobacteria and Chloroflexi. Of the Archaea detected, Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales made up practically the whole archaeal community. The results showed the importance of selecting an appropriate inoculum in short term processes due to the fact that the major microbial constituents in the initial consortia remained stable throughout anaerobic digestion.",

Evidence of an effect on adipose tissue mass in humans is limited, and no studies have specifically aimed to elucidate this in infancy. To explore whether n-3 LCPUFA intake affects adipose tissue growth, we randomly allocated 154 healthy infants to daily supplementation with FO or sunflower oil (SO) from 9 to 18 mo of age and measured z-score changes in various anthropometric assessments of body size and skinfold thicknesses and plasma adipokine concentrations. Among the 133 completing infants, erythrocyte n-3 PUFA increased more in those receiving FO than in infants receiving SO [12.2 ± 0.7 (mean ± SE) versus 2.0 ± 0.4 fatty acid percentage (FA%), p < 0.001] with a concomitant larger decrease in n-6 PUFA (-8.9 ± 0.7 versus -0.9 ± 0.6 FA%, p < 0.001). We found no association between FO consumption relative to SO consumption and any of the anthropometric measures related to the size of the fat mass, but infants in the FO group had a lower skinfold ratio (triceps/subscapular) at 18 mo than those in SO group (p = 0.02). Our findings do not support the hypothesis that dietary n-3 LCPUFA is important for infant fat mass, but future studies testing this specifically are warranted.",

The aim of the present study was to determine whether the consumption of hydroxytyrosol-enriched sunflower oil (HSO) improves certain CVD biomarker values. A total of twenty-two healthy volunteers participated in a cross-over study involving two 3-week periods, separated by a 2-week washout period, in which volunteers consumed 800-1275 μg/d [corrected] of either HSO (45-50 mg/d of hydroxytyrosol) or non-enriched (control) sunflower oil. Total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, arylesterase activity, oxidised LDL and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM-1) levels were measured in the plasma obtained at the beginning and at the end of each treatment period. The HSO group displayed a significantly higher level (P < 0·01) of arylesterase activity and significantly lower levels of oxidised LDL and sVCAM-1 (both P < 0·05) than the control group. These results suggest that HSO may help prevent CVD.",

      "abstract": "The relationship between chronic alcohol consumption and various hepatic lesions are grouped under the term alcoholic liver disease. This is an extremely common disease with a high mortality. Alcoholics, along with alcohol, consume high fat diet and are susceptible to permanent liver damage. The current treatment modalities are inadequate and the need for effective treatment without side-effects is increasing. The present work tested the protective role of Phyllanthus niruri aqueous leaf extract on alcohol and heated sunflower oil-induced hyperlipidemia. Male albino rats of Wistar strain were used for this study. This study analyzed the variation in lipid profiles; cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, and free fatty acids in liver, histopathological changes, and the activities of liver marker enzymes in the plasma. The liver damage was apparent with the increase in the activities of AST and ALT in the rats treated with alcohol + heated sunflower oil (ΔPUFA). Treatment with P.niruri protected the liver from damage, and prevented the release of the liver markers enzymes. The levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acids were increased significantly in the alcohol + ΔPUFA group. Administration of P.niruri extract effectively reduced their levels. The phospholipid levels, which were decreased in the liver of the alcohol + ΔPUFA group, were positively modulated by treatment with P.niruri. The histopathological observations were also in correlation with the biochemical parameters. From the results obtained, one could conclude that the P.niruri leaf extract effectively protects the system against alcohol and ΔPUFA-induced hyperlipidemia and has a definite anti-hyperlipidemic potential.",

The disease has been reported to occur in most countries, with a prevalence of up to 28% in some countries in some breeds. The only truly effective therapy currently available is to prevent horses from coming into contact with Culicoides midges, which can be achieved by stabling horses during certain times of the day or by covering them with insect blankets. The effect of a new dietary supplement containing vitamins, polypeptides, and amino acids on IBH severity was tested at the start of the Culicoides season (April 2009). Fifty horses participated in this placebo-controlled, double-blinded study: 25 horses received the supplement and 25 received placebo for 30 days; thereafter all horses received the supplement for a further 30 days. The investigators scored the severity of IBH in all horses, based on clinical evaluation and digital photographs taken before and after the first 30 days of the trial. The owners were asked to assess the severity of the signs prior to the investigation and after the first and second 30-day periods. For each period, IBH clinical symptoms were classified as increased, decreased, or the same. Results showed that investigator-assessed symptoms became worse in more horses receiving placebo than in horses receiving supplement, indicating a positive effect of the supplement. However, there were no treatment-group differences when symptom severity was scored by the horse owners. No side-effects were observed.",

      "abstract": "Rumen microbial biohydrogenation of dietary unsaturated fatty acids has a major effect on the process of developing healthier dairy products. This study aimed to investigate in vivo the effect of diet supplementation with sunflower (SO) and fish (FO) oils on the rumen bacterial community in dairy sheep. First, 32 lactating ewes, divided in 8 lots of 4 animals each (2 lots per treatment), were fed a high-concentrate total mixed ration supplemented with 0, 2% SO, 1% FO, or 2% SO plus 1% FO. After 21 d, rumen fluid samples were taken from each lot for DNA extraction and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. In a second experiment, 5 cannulated ewes were first fed the same TMR, with the exception of a higher forage level, and then changed to the same diet supplemented with 2% SO plus 1% FO. After 0, 3, and 10 d, rumen content samples were taken for DNA extraction and FISH analysis (fluid). Total bacteria and the Butyrivibrio group were studied in microbial DNA by terminal RFLP analysis (T-RFLP), and real-time PCR was used to quantify Butyrivibrio bacteria that produce vaccenic acid or stearic acid. In rumen fluid samples, total bacteria and clostridial clusters IX and XIV were analyzed by FISH. Dietary supplementation with SO plus FO seemed to induce important changes in the total bacteria and Butyrivibrio populations, and a high interindividual variation was observed, and the speed of the effect of the lipid supplementation depended on the individual microbial composition. Analysis by T-RFLP and FISH showed increases in cluster IX bacteria with SO plus FO supplementation, presumably Quinella-like microorganisms. The abundances of vaccenic acid- and stearic acid-producing Butyrivibrio relative to total bacteria, estimated by real time PCR, were low (0.28 and 0.18%, respectively, in rumen fluid, and 0.86 and 0.81% in rumen contents) and only that of SA-producing bacteria seemed to be reduced by diets containing FO, although differences were only significant in lactating ewes. The T-RFLP analysis showed a variable effect of lipid supplementation on different bacteria of the family Lachnospiraceae, which includes the cultured bacteria known to be actively involved in rumen biohydrogenation. These results suggest that the latter bacteria do not play a dominant role in this process, and therefore other as-yet-uncultivated microorganisms might be more relevant.",

Fifty Assaf ewes in mid lactation were distributed in 10 lots of 5 animals each and allocated to 5 treatments (2 lots per treatment): no lipid supplementation (control) or supplementation with 25 g of sunflower oil/kg of DM plus 0 (SO), 8 (SOMA(1)), 16 (SOMA(2)), or 24 (SOMA(3)) g of MA (56.7% ether extract)/kg of DM. Milk production and composition, including FA profile, were analyzed on d 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 of treatment. Neither intake nor milk yield were significantly affected by lipid addition, but all MA supplements decreased milk fat content from d 14 onward, reaching a 30% reduction after 28 d on SOMA(3). This milk fat depression might be related not only to the joint action of some putative fat synthesis inhibitors, such as trans-9,cis-11 C18:2 and probably trans-10 C18:1, but also to the limited ability of the mammary gland to maintain a desirable milk fat fluidity, that would have been caused by the noticeable increase in trans-C18:1 together with the lowered availability of stearic acid for oleic acid synthesis through Delta(9)-desaturase. Furthermore, all lipid supplements, and mainly MA, reduced the secretion of de novo FA (C6:0-C14:0) without increasing the yield of preformed FA (>C16). Supplementation with sunflower oil plus MA resulted in larger increases in cis-9,trans-11 C18:2 than those observed with sunflower oil alone, achieving a mean content as high as 3.22% of total FA and representing a more than 7-fold increase compared with the control. Vaccenic acid (trans-11 C18:1) was also significantly enhanced (on average +794% in SOMA treatments), as was C22:6 n-3 (DHA) content, although the transfer efficiency of the latter, from the diets to the milk, was very low (5%). However, the highest levels of MA inclusion (SOMA(2) and SOMA(3)) reduced the milk n-6:n-3 ratio, but MA supplements caused an important increase in trans-10 C18:1, which would rule out the possibility that this milk has a healthier fat profile before determining the specific role of each individual FA and ensuring that this trans-FA is at least innocuous in relation to cardiovascular disease risk.",

In this work, ewe diet was supplemented with FO, alone or in combination with SO, with the aim of improving milk nutritional value and evaluating its effect on animal performance. Sixty-four Assaf ewes in mid lactation, fed a high-concentrate diet, were distributed in 8 lots of 8 animals each and assigned to 4 treatments (2 lots/treatment): no lipid supplementation (control) or supplementation with 20 g of SO/kg (SO), 10 g of FO/kg (FO), or 20 g of SO plus 10 g of FO/kg (SOFO). Milk production and composition, including a complete fatty acid profile, were analyzed on d 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 of treatments. Supplementation with FO tended to reduce dry matter intake compared with the control treatment (-15%), and its use in combination with SO (SOFO) resulted in a significant decrease in milk yield as well (-13%). All lipid supplements reduced milk protein content, and FO also reduced milk fat content by up to 21% alone (FO) and 27% in combination with SO (SOFO). Although the mechanisms involved in FO-induced milk fat depression are not yet well established, the observed increase in some milk trans-FA that are putative inhibitors of milk fat synthesis, such as trans-9,cis-11 CLA, and the 63% decrease in C18:0 (consistent with the theory of reduced milk fat fluidity) may be involved. When compared with the control, lipid supplementation remarkably improved the milk content of rumenic acid (cis-9,trans-11 CLA; up to 4-fold increases with SO and SOFO diets), whereas FO-containing diets also increased milk n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, mainly docosahexaenoic acid (with mean contents of 0.29 and 0.38% of total fatty acids for SOFO and FO, respectively), and reduced the n-6:n-3 FA ratio to approximately half the control value. All lipid supplements resulted in high levels of some trans-FA, mainly trans-11 C18:1 (vaccenic acid) but also trans-10 C18:1.",

Sixteen midlactation multiparous goats received diets differing in forage-to-concentrate ratio [high forage (HF) 64:36, and low forage (LF) 43:57] supplemented or not with lipids [HF with 130 g/d of oil from whole intact rapeseeds (RS) and LF with 130 g/d of sunflower oil (SO)] in a 4 x 4 Latin square design. Milk yield, milk composition, FA profile, and FA secretion were measured, as well as the expression profiles of key genes in mammary metabolism and of 8,382 genes, using a bovine oligonucleotide microarray. After 3 wk of treatment, milk, lactose, and protein yields were lower with HF-RS than with the other diets, whereas treatment had no effect on milk protein content. Milk fat content was higher with the HF-RS and LF-SO diets than with the HF and LF diets, and SO supplementation increased milk fat yield compared with the LF diet. Decreasing the forage-to-concentrate ratio from 64:36 to 43:57 had a limited effect on goat milk FA concentrations and secretions. Supplementing the LF diet with SO changed almost all the FA concentrations, including decreases in medium-chain saturated FA and large increases in trans C18:1 and C18:2 isomers (particularly trans-11 C18:1 and cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid), without significant changes in C18:0 and cis-9 C18:1, whereas supplementing the HF diet with RS led to a strong decrease in short- and medium-chain saturated FA and a very strong increase in C18:0 and cis-9 C18:1, without significant changes in trans C18:1 and conjugated linoleic acid. Despite the decreases in milk lactose and protein yields observed with HF-RS, and despite the decrease in milk medium-chain FA and the increase in C18 FA secretion with RS or SO supplementation, none of the dietary treatments had any effect on mammary mRNA expression of the key genes involved in lactose (e.g., alpha-lactalbumin), protein (e.g., beta-casein), and lipid metabolism (e.g., lipoprotein lipase) after 3 wk of treatment. In addition, transcriptome analysis did not provide evidence of treatments inducing significant changes in the expression of specific genes in the mammary gland. However, 2-way hierarchical clustering analysis highlighted different global mammary expression profiles between diets, showing that the gene expression profiles corresponding to the same diet were gathered by common groups of genes. This experiment suggests that after 3 wk of dietary treatment, other factors, such as substrate availability for mammary metabolism, could play an important role in contributing to milk FA responses to changes in diet composition in the goat.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome is associated with subsequent development of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. It is characterized by reduced response to insulin, central obesity, and dyslipidemia. Intake of plant sterols (PS) has been shown to confer a healthier lipid profile and ameliorate cardiovascular disease risk factors in experimental animals and humans. In this study we used an animal model of type 2 diabetes to assess the effects of a preparation of PS esterified to high oleic sunflower oil fatty acids mixed with dietary diacylglycerol (PS-HOSO) on diabetic related metabolic parameters. Psammomys obesus (P. obesus) were fed high energy (HE) diet supplemented by either PS-HOSO or control oil. Following 4.5 weeks of intervention, animals were divided into fasting and non-fasting modes prior to outcome measurements. Glucose and insulin levels as well as blood lipid profile, body weight, and fat accumulation were evaluated in fasting and non-fasting modes. RESULTS: P. obesus fed with a HE diet displayed a characteristic heterogeneity in their blood glucose and insulin levels with a subset group displaying type 2 diabetes symptoms. PS-HOSO treatment significantly reduced total cholesterol (24%, P < 0.001) and non-HDL cholesterol (34%, P < 0.01) compared to the control diet. Among fasting animals, body weight at end point and epididymal fat-to-liver weight ratio were significantly (P < 0.05 each) reduced (7% and 16%, respectively) compared to controls. Interestingly, fasting blood glucose levels were similar between groups, whereas plasma insulin level at end point was 44% lower in the PS-HOSO group compared to control group (P < 0.0001) CONCLUSION: PS-HOSO supplementation to diabetes-prone gerbils counteracts the increase in body weight and epididymal fat accumulation, and also results in a drop in circulating insulin levels. These effects are pointing out that PS-HOSO may serve as a functional ingredient for metabolic syndrome or diabetic sufferers, which not only influences body weight, but also prevents or reverses insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia.",

SUBJECT AND METHODS: Twenty-five men with severe hypercholesterolemia and high estimate cardiovascular risk (> 20% according to the Adult Treatment Panel III of USA National Institutes of Health, ATP-III) were enrolled in an observational follow-up study to test lipoprotein profile changes after ix month 20-mg/d Simvastatin treatment. Thirteen volunteers using sunflower oil as the habitual culinary fat, and 12 using olive oil, were selected by non-probabilistic incidental sampling. Volunteers consent in follow their habitual diets and to maintain diet characteristics throughout the study. Diet was evaluated through the study by three 24-h recalls and a food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: The energy contribution of fat (P = 0.019) and MUFA (P < 0.001) was higher in the olive oil-group while that of PUFA (P = 0.001) and alcohol (P = 0.005) was higher in the sunflower oil-group. TC/HDL-cholesterol and the ATP-III 10-year risk percent decreased more (P < 0.05) in the olive oil group. TC and the TC/HDL-cholesterol and the LDL-cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratios and the ATP-III 10-year risk percent decreased significantly more (P < 0.05) in the olive oil-group after BMI, energy and alcohol intakes were adjusted. CONCLUSION: Data suggest that although Simvastatin is a very effective hypolipemic drug, olive oil-diets in preference to sunflower oil-diets must be consumed in patients with high cardiovascular risk.",

Feed consumption and live weight gain were responsive to dietary sunflower oil inclusion during the starter period, but not during the grower period. Increasing sunflower oil level linearly increased crude protein and fat digestibilities. Except for abdominal fat, weights of inedible parts and edible organs remained unchanged by the diets. The treatments linearly decreased weight and efficiency of carcass and weights of wings and breast and did not alter weights of thighs and neck. Breast meat saturated fatty acids decreased linearly by 17.9% and unsaturated fatty acids increased linearly by 10.6%, as sunflower oil level increased in the diets. Monounsaturated fatty acids decreased linearly by 27.3%, whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids increased linearly by 51%. Overall, n-3 (0.78% vs. 0.59%) and n-6 (42.6% vs. 29.8%) were greater in breast meat in treatment groups than in control group. In conclusion, sunflower addition into diets has minimal effects on performance of growing partridges, but significantly alters meat fatty acid composition.",

Four hundreds 36-week-old Nick Brown layer hens were allocated into five groups. Treatment groups were supplemented with 1.5% of sunflower crude oil, hazelnut crude oil, acidulated sunflower soapstock, acidulated hazelnut soapstock and acidulated hazelnut crude oil. The daily feed consumption for groups that were fed with crude oils were numerically improved as compared for those nourished with acidulated soapstocks. Although the percentages of cracked and broken eggs in acidulated hazelnut soapstock group was significantly higher than the other groups, daily feed consumption and egg production values were not different. The usage of acidulated hazelnut soapstock reduced the percentage of intact egg ratio. Egg's specific gravity and yolk color index were the highest level throughout the experiment from start to end in hazelnut crude oil group (p < 0.05). In group that was nourished by hazelnut oil, Omega 3/Omega-6 fatty acid ratios in egg yolk were higher than the groups that were fed with sunflower oil. The oleic acid content of the egg yolk was increased in the groups which were supplemented with hazelnut crude oil and acidulated hazelnut crude oil. Consequently, hazelnut crude oil and acidulated hazelnut crude oil improved the egg shell quality, yolk color index and yolk oleic acid value which would increase egg's shelf life. On the other hand acidulated hazelnut soapstock supplementation adversely affects the quality of egg shell.",

Oleozon produced inactivation of Giardia trophozoites in a dose- and cell density-dependent manner. Thirty microliter of Oleozon with peroxide index value of 500 equivalent-mmol of activated oxygen per kilogram were used to achieve a 100% inhibition (<-4.00 log unit) of trophozoites from an initial inoculum of 15x10(4) cells. This potent effect was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy where morphological deterioration of superficial structures mainly in the ventral disc, and formation of a great number of micro vesicles in the cytoplasm were found. We concluded that a direct chemical-oxidation attack by the active substances from Oleozon is one of the causes of the parasitocidal effect of this product. We suggest that the dose and cell density-dependent effect must be taken into account when prescription of this product for giardiasis treatment in humans.",

      "abstract": "The sunflower is one of the four most important oilseed crops in the world, and the nutritional quality of its edible oil ranks among the best vegetable oils in cultivation. Typically up to 90% of the fatty acids in conventional sunflower oil are unsaturated, namely oleic (C 18:1, 16%-19%) and linoleic (C 18:2, 68%-72%) fatty acids. Palmitic (C 16:0, 6%), stearic (C 18:0, 5%), and minor amounts of myristic (C 14:0), myristoleic (C 14:1), palmitoleic (C 16:1), arachidic (C 20:0), behenic (C 22:0), and other fatty acids account for the remaining 10%. Advances in modern genetics, most importantly induced mutations, have altered the fatty acid composition of sunflower oil to a significant extent. Treating sunflower seeds with gamma- and X-rays has produced mutants with 25%-30% palmitic acid. Sunflower seed treatment with X-rays has also resulted in mutants having 30% palmitoleic acid, while treatments with mutagenic sodium azide have produced seeds containing 35% stearic acid. The most important mutations have been obtained by treatment with dimethyl sulfate, which produced genotypes with more than 90% oleic acid. Mutants have also been obtained that have a high linoleic acid content (>80%) by treating seeds with X-rays and ethyl methanesulfonate. Of the vitamin E family of compounds, sunflower oil is known to predominantly contain alpha-tocopherol (>90%). Spontaneous mutations controlled by recessive genes have been discovered that significantly alter tocopherol forms and levels. The genes in question are tph(1) (50% alpha- and 50% beta-tocopherol), tph(2) (0%-5% alpha- and 95%-100% gamma-tocopherol), and tph(1)tph(2) (8%-40% alpha-, 0%-25% beta-, 25%-84% gamma-, and 8%-50% delta-tocopherol). The existence of (mutant) genes for increased levels of individual fatty acids and for different forms and levels of tocopherol enables the development of sunflower hybrids with different oil quality. The greatest progress has been made in developing high-oleic hybrids (>90% oleic acid). There has been considerable work done recently on the development of high-oleic hybrids with altered tocopherol levels, the oil of which will have 10-20 times greater oxidative stability than that of conventional sunflower oil. While sunflower breeders work on developing hybrids with altered oil quality, medical scientists in general and nutritionists in particular will determine the parameters for the use of these novel types of oil that can improve human nutrition and be used in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The gastric damage was induced by indomethacin (20 mg/kg) as solution in 0.5% sodium bicarbonate and given intragastrically. Three hours later OSO (4, 12 and 24 mg/kg) and cimetidine 25 mg/kg were administered also by oral route. Four hours thereafter the rats were killed and the stomachs were removed for biochemical analysis and histological study. RESULTS: The gastric ulcer index was reduced by OSO and cimetidine. OSO also reduced TBARS concentration, but it increased SOD activity in gastric mucosa homogenates. In contrast, CAT activity was not significantly modified the treatment. Histological study confirmed the cytoprotective effects of OSO in rat gastric mucosa damaged by indomethacin. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that cytoprotective effects of OSO in rat gastric mucosa are mediated at least partially by upregulation of the antioxidant system and mainly SOD.",

The objective of this study was to compare the effect of FO and sunflower oil (SFO) supplementation on milk cis-9, trans-11 CLA when dairy cows managed on pasture or in confinement. Fourteen Holstein cows were assigned into 2 treatment groups: cows grazed on alfalfa-grass pasture (PAS) or were fed corn silage-alfalfa hay mix ad libitum (LOT). Both groups were supplemented with a 8.2 kg/d grain supplement containing 640 g of FO and SFO (1:3 wt/ wt). Grain supplement was fed in 2 equal portions after each milking, for a period of 3 wk. Milk samples were collected during the last 3 d of the experimental period. Milk yield was greater with the LOT diet (23.1 kg/ d) compared with the PAS diet (19.4 kg/d). Milk fat percentages (2.51 and 2.95 for the LOT and PAS, respectively) and yields (0.57 and 0.51 kg/d) were similar for the 2 diets. Milk protein percentages were not affected by diets (3.34 and 3.35 for the LOT and PAS diets, respectively), but protein yields were lower for the PAS diet (0.61 kg/d) compared with the LOT diet (0.75 kg/ d). Treatment diets had no effect on milk trans C18:1 concentrations [10.64 and 9.82 g/100 g of total fatty acids (FA) for the LOT and PAS, respectively] or yields (60.65 and 64.01 g/d), but did affect isomers distributions. Concentration (g/100 g of total FA) of vaccenic acid was lower with the LOT diet (2.15) compared with the PAS diet (4.52), whereas concentration of trans-10 C18:1 was greater with the LOT diet (4.99) compared with the PAS diet (1.69). Milk cis-9, trans-11 CLA concentration was greater with the PAS diet (1.52) compared with the LOT diet (0.84). In conclusion, the increase in milk cis-9, trans-11 CLA content was greater when pasture-based diets were supplemented with FO and SFO. The lower cis-9, trans-11 CLA concentration in milk from the confinement-fed cows resulted from trans-10 C18:1 replacing vaccenic acid as the predominant trans C18:1 isomer.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of forage level in diets containing FO and sunflower oil (SFO) on the production of trans C18:1 and CLA by mixed ruminal microbes. A dual-flow continuous culture system consisting of three fermenters was used in a 3 × 3 Latin-square design. Treatments consisted of (1) 75:25 forage:concentrate (HF); (2) 50:50 forage:concentrate (MF); and (3) 25:75 forage:concentrate (LF). FO and SFO were added to each diet at 1 and 2 g/100 g dry matter (DM), respectively. The forage source was alfalfa pellets. During 10-day incubations, fermenters were fed treatment diets three times daily (140 g/day, divided equally between three feedings) as TMR diet. Effluents from the last 3 days of incubation were collected and composited for analysis. The concentration of trans C18:1 (17.20, 26.60, and 36.08 mg/g DM overflow for HF, MF, and LF treatments, respectively) increased while CLA (2.53, 2.35, and 0.81 mg/g DM overflow) decreased in a linear manner ( P < 0.05) as dietary forage level decreased. As dietary forage levels decreased, the concentrations of t10 C18:1 (0.0, 10.5, 33.5 mg/g DM) in effluent increased ( P < 0.05) and t10c12 CLA (0.08, 0.12, 0.35 mg/g DM) tended to increases ( P < 0.09) linearly.

Fourteen Holstein cows were divided into 2 groups (7 cows/treatment) and fed either a control or oil-supplemented diet for 8 wk while partially grazing pasture. Cows in group 1 were fed a grain mix diet (8.0 kg/d, DM basis) containing 400 g of saturated animal fat (control). Cows in the second group were fed the same grain mix diet except the saturated animal fat was replaced with 100 g of FO and 300 g of SFO. Cows were milked twice a day and milk samples were collected weekly throughout the trial. Both groups grazed together on alfalfa-based pasture ad libitum and were fed their treatment diets after the morning and afternoon milking. Milk production (30.0 and 31.2 kg/d), milk fat percentages (3.64 and 3.50), milk fat yield (1.08 and 1.09 kg/d), milk protein percentages (2.97 and 2.88), and milk protein yield (0.99 and 0.91 kg/d) for diets 1 and 2, respectively, were not affected by the treatment diets. The concentrations of cis-9, trans-11 CLA (1.64 vs. 0.84 g/100 g of fatty acids) and vaccenic acid (5.11 vs. 2.20 g/100 g of fatty acids) in milk fat were higher for cows fed the oil-supplemented diet over the 8 wk of oil supplementation. The concentration of cis-9, trans-11 CLA in milk fat reached a maximum (1.0 and 1.64 g/100 g of fatty acids for diets 1 and 2, respectively) in wk 1 for both diets and remained relatively constant thereafter. The concentration of vaccenic acid in milk fat followed the same temporal pattern as cis-9, trans-11 CLA. In conclusion, supplementing the diet of partially grazing cows with FO and SFO increased the milk cis-9, trans-11 CLA content, and that increase remained relatively constant after 1 wk of oil supplementation.",

OSO was administered to rats intragastrically by a cannula and it was applied during four days to animals. The doses of OSO administered daily to each group of rats were 4, 12, and 24 mg/kg, respectively, and one hour after the last treatment, absolute ethanol (1 mL/200 mg body weight) was administered. Our results showed that gastric ulcer index was significantly reduced in rats pretreated with OSO as compared with ethanol-treated controls. However, in rats pretreated with OSO, no significant reduction of TBARS content in gastric mucosa was found as compared to those rats treated with ethanol alone. In contrast, SOD and GSH-Px activities were significantly increased in gastric mucosa of OSO-pretreated rats with respect to those treated with ethanol alone. In summary, our results demonstrate that OSO pretreatment exerts protective effects in ethanol-induced gastric ulcers in rats. Furthermore, these results provide evidence that these protective effects of OSO are mediated at least partially by stimulation of some important antioxidant enzymes such as SOD and GSH-Px, which are scavengers of ROS and therefore prevent gastric injury induced by them.",

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the hypolipidemic effects of FO-PS supplementation in healthy hypercholesterolemic persons fed an olive oil (OO)-based diet. DESIGN: Twenty-one moderately overweight, hyperlipidemic subjects participated in a semi-randomized, single-blind, 4-period crossover study including 4 experimental isoenergetic diets of 4 wk each and 4-wk intervening washout periods. Diets contained 30% of energy as fat, of which 70% was from extra-virgin OO, and differed only in the supplement oil: OO, fish oil, FO-PS, or sunflower oil esters of plant sterols (SU-PS). Both fish oil and FO-PS provided 5.4 g total eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids/d. FO-PS, SU-PS, and OO provided the equivalent of 1.7, 1.7, and 0.02 g free plant sterols/d, respectively. RESULTS: Fish oil and FO-PS resulted in fasting and postprandial plasma triacylglycerol concentrations that were markedly lower than those observed with OO and SU-PS (P = 0.0001), but to a different extent. LDL cholesterol was significantly lower after supplementation with FO-PS and SU-PS than at the end of the control OO diet (P = 0.0031 and 0.0407, respectively). HDL cholesterol was not affected. FO-PS and SU-PS resulted in a lower ratio of total to HDL cholesterol and lower apolipoprotein (apo) B concentrations than did OO and fish oil. The ratio of apoB to apoA was significantly lower after SU-PS consumption than after consumption of OO (P = 0.0126) and fish oil (P = 0.0292). FO-PS and SU-PS resulted in similar ratios of apoB to apoA. HDL2 and the ratio of HDL2 to HDL3 were significantly higher at the end of the FO-PS treatment than at the end of the OO (P = 0.0006), fish oil (P = 0.0036), and SU-PS (P = 0.0016) treatments. CONCLUSION: Supplementation of an OO-based diet with FO-PS may reduce cardiovascular disease risk more than does supplementation with fish oil or SU-PS.",

      "abstract": "Based on the potential benefits of cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) for human health, there is a need to develop effective strategies for enhancing milk fat CLA concentrations. Levels of cis-9, trans-11 CLA in milk can be increased by supplements of fish oil (FO) and sunflower oil (SO), but there is considerable variation in the response. Part of this variance may reflect time-dependent ruminal adaptations to high levels of lipid in the diet, which lead to alterations in the formation of specific biohydrogenation intermediates. To test this hypothesis, 16 late lactation Holstein-British Friesian cows were used in a repeated measures randomized block design to examine milk fatty acid composition responses to FO and SO in the diet over a 28-d period. Cows were allocated at random to corn silage-based rations (8 per treatment) containing 0 (control) or 45 g of oil supplement/kg of dry matter consisting (1:2; wt/wt) of FO and SO (FSO), and milk composition was determined on alternate days from d 1. Compared with the control, the FSO diet decreased mean dry matter intake (21.1 vs. 17.9 kg/d), milk fat (47.7 vs. 32.6 g/kg), and protein content (36.1 vs. 33.3 g/kg), but had no effect on milk yield (27.1 vs. 26.4 kg/d). Reductions in milk fat content relative to the FSO diet were associated with increases in milk trans-10 18:1, trans-10, cis-12 CLA, and trans-9, cis-11 CLA concentrations (r(2) = 0.74, 0.57, and 0.80, respectively). Compared with the control, the FSO diet reduced milk 4:0 to 18:0 and cis 18:1 content and increased trans 18:1, trans 18:2, cis-9, trans-11 CLA, 20:5 n-3, and 22:6 n-3 concentrations. The FSO diet caused a rapid elevation in milk cis-9, trans-11 CLA content, reaching a maximum of 5.37 g/100 g of fatty acids on d 5, but these increases were transient, declining to 2.35 g/100 g of fatty acids by d 15. They remained relatively constant thereafter. Even though concentrations of trans-11 18:1 followed the same pattern of temporal changes as cis-9, trans-11 CLA, the total trans 18:1 content of FSO milk was unchanged because of the concomitant increases in the concentration of other isomers (Delta(4-10) and Delta(12-15)), predominantely trans-10 18:1. In conclusion, supplementing diets with FSO enhances milk fat cis-9, trans-11 CLA content, but the high level of enrichment declines because of changes in ruminal biohydrogenation that result in trans-10 replacing trans-11 as the major 18:1 biohydrogenation intermediate formed in the rumen.",

      "abstract": "Liver fibrosis is the result of imbalance between extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and breakdown. Ethanol-induced increase in redox state is a sign of major change in hepatic metabolism and this inhibits tricarboxylic acid cycle activity and, fatty acid oxidation and increases fatty acid uptake, thus predisposing fatty liver. Fibrotic changes induced by alcohol are provoked by diets rich in PUFA. Heating of oils rich in PUFA produces toxic volatile and nonvolatile compounds, which aggravate liver damage. Hepatotoxicity was induced in male Wistar rats by administering alcohol (20%) and thermally oxidized sunflower oil (Delta PUFA) (15%). When N-acetyl cyteine (NAC) (150 mg/kg body weight), an ROS scavenger, was administered, there was a reversal of liver damage, which was demonstrated biochemically. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), being potential biochemical indicators of fibroproliferation, were estimated in the present study, which were found to be altered in alcohol, Delta PUFA, and alcohol + Delta PUFA. The altered activities of MMPs in these groups were effectively modulated by treatment with NAC. Thus, in this study, NAC was found to modulate the effect of alcohol and Delta PUFA-induced liver damage."

Decreasing LDL and apolipoprotein (apo) AII-lipoproteins is also appropriate for CHD protection and treatment. AIM: To study the effects of an 8%En dietary exchange of linoleic acid for oleic acid on serum and lipoprotein levels and serum and LDL-TBARS in postmenopausal women consuming a diet rich in fat (46%En; saturated/monounsaturated/polyunsaturated profile: 1.1/1.9/1). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: 14 postmenopausal women (63 +/- 11 years) were assigned to exchange during 28-day dietary period the culinary oil used for years consisting in a blend of olive oil plus sunflower oil (SO) for extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). SO and EVOO represented 62% of the total lipid intake. DETERMINATIONS: Dietary intakes, serum Lp(a), and cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, protein, apolipoproteins AI, AII, B were determined in serum and lipoproteins. RESULTS: The dietary intervention decreased serum total cholesterol (TC), phospholipids, apo AII (all, p < 0.001) and apo B (p < 0.01). Except for triglycerides, all components of the LDL fraction decreased (at least, p < 0.05). HDL-cholesterol was not affected but HDL-phospholipids and HDL-lipids decreased (at least, p < 0.01). VLDL-apo B and VLDL-proteins decreased (all, p < 0.001). Serum Lp(a), TBARS and LDL-TBARS were not affected by the dietary exchange. The estimate of 10-year cardiovascular risk decreased (p < 0.05). Apo AII (p = 0.061) and LDL-cholesterol (p < 0.05) underwent greater modifications in normocholesterolemics, while LDL-phospholipids (p = 0.094), experienced greater alterations in hypercholesterolemics. No significant interaction was observed between dietary exchange and age (> or <65 yrs). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the dietary exchange of an olive oil and sunflower oil blend for extra virgin olive decreases LDL and apo AII levels, and the estimate of 10-year cardiovascular risk.",

Heating of oil rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) produces various lipid peroxidative end products that can aggravate the pathological changes produced by ethanol. In the present communication, the effect of Cuminum cyminum was investigated on alcohol and thermally oxidized oil induced hyperlipidaemia. The results showed increased activity of aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) and increased levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipids in the plasma of rats given alcohol, thermally oxidized oil and alcohol+thermally oxidized oil when compared with the normal control group. The levels of tissue (liver and kidney) cholesterol and triglycerides were increased significantly in rats groups given alcohol, thermally oxidized oil and alcohol+thermally oxidized oil when compared with the normal control rats. The levels were decreased when cumin was given along with alcohol and thermally oxidized oil. The level of phospholipids decreased significantly in the liver and kidney of groups given alcohol, thermally oxidized oil and alcohol+thermally oridized oil when compared with the normal control rats. The level increased when cumin was administered along with alcohol and thermally oxidized oil. The activity of phospholipase A and C increased significantly in the liver of groups given alcohol, thermally oxidized oil and alcohol+thermally oxidized oil when compared with the normal control rats, whereas the activity was decreased with the cumin treatment. The results obtained indicate that cumin can decrease the lipid levels in alcohol and thermally oxidized oil induced hepatotoxicity.",

DESIGN: A double-blinded, randomized, three period crossover, controlled feeding study. SUBJECTS/SETTING: Thirty-one men (n=12) and women (n=19) with moderate hypercholesterolemia who were 25 to 64 years of age. INTERVENTION: Experimental diets provided 30% fat (olive oil or NuSun sunflower oil contributed one half of the total fat), 8.3% vs 7.9% saturated fatty acid, 17.2% vs 14.2% monounsaturated fatty acid, and 4.3% vs. 7.7% PUFA (olive oil and NuSun sunflower oil, respectively), and 294 mg cholesterol. The control diet was an average American diet (34% fat, 11.2% saturated fatty acid, 14.9% monounsaturated fatty acid, 7.8% PUFA). Subjects consumed each diet for 4 weeks with a 2-week compliance break before crossing over to another diet. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lipid and lipoprotein levels were measured, and measures of oxidative stress, including lag time, rate of oxidation, total dienes, and lipid hydroperoxides, were assessed. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The mixed model procedure was used to test for main effects of diet, feeding period, and order of diets. Tukey-Kramer adjusted P values were used to determine diet effects. RESULTS: The NuSun sunflower oil diet decreased both total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels compared with the average American diet and the olive oil diet. There was no effect of the olive oil diet compared with the average American diet. Total cholesterol decreased 4.7% and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased 5.8% on the NuSun sunflower oil diet vs the average American diet. There was no effect of the experimental diets on triglyceride levels, rate of oxidation, total dienes, lipid hydroperoxides, or alpha-tocopherol. Lag time was the longest following the olive oil diet and shortest following the NuSun sunflower oil diet. CONCLUSIONS: The higher PUFA content appeared to account for the greater total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering and reduction in lag time of the NuSun sunflower oil diet. However, the fact that there were no differences in the resulting oxidation products suggests there were no adverse effects on low-density lipoprotein oxidation. Since PUFAs are important for cholesterol lowering, foods that replace saturated fatty acids should include a balance of unsaturated fatty acids.",

INTERVENTION: Blood was sampled at the beginning and end point of each 5-week diet period for analysis of coagulation and fibrinolysis factors and blood lipids. Subjects kept 3-day food diaries twice during each of the three diet periods and were weighed on each visit for blood collection. Analysis of plasma fatty acids was used to indicate dietary compliance. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Differences in fasting factor VIIc, fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, insulin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoproteins A-1 and B, and plasma oleic acid levels while receiving the SFA diet vs MUFA diet. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: A general linear model allowing for the ABB/BAA extra-period crossover, was used for each of the outcome measures. RESULTS: Factor VIIc was lower on the MUFA diet ( P <.05) but fibrinogen and insulin concentrations and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity did not differ between diets. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( P <.001) and triglyceride ( P <.01) levels were lower on the MUFA diet compared with the SFA diet. A significant increase in both plasma phospholipid and neutral lipid oleic acid (P <.0001) occurred on the MUFA diet. CONCLUSIONS: Substitution of foods rich in saturated fat with foods rich in high-oleic-acid sunflower oil and margarine has favorable outcomes on blood lipids and factor VIIc. This oil presents another useful source of MUFA for diets aimed at prevention of heart disease.",

Further chemical reduction of protein disulfide bridges greatly reduced the melt viscosity of the moistened composite that it could be injection-molded. The molded specimens were tested and their tensile and flexural properties and water absorption calculated. Their water resistance appeared to be particularly high, and could be enhanced further after a thermal treatment (N2, 200 degrees C). The proteic matrix seemed to behave like a natural thermoset resin. Sunflower oil cake could be used without any additives to make biodegradable, water resistant and exceptionally cheap materials.",

      "abstract": "Dietary inclusion of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-rich plant oils is one approach to improving the fatty acid profile of ruminant meat and meat products from a human health perspective. Whole crop wheat silages represent a possible alternative forage to grass silage for beef production, however, they may adversely impact the fatty acid profile of ruminant muscle since grass silage is rich in C18:3n-3. The first objective of this experiment was to investigate the relationship between an increase in the dietary supply of C18:2n-6 from sunflower oil (SFO) and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) concentration in the muscle tissue of beef cattle. The second objective was to investigate the effect of the basal forage type on the muscle fatty acid composition and its response to increasing inclusion of SFO. One hundred and five heifers were blocked according to initial bodyweight and assigned to one of seven silage treatments. The silage treatments were: (1) grass silage (GS), (2) whole crop wheat silage with 38% dry matter (DM) (W1), (3) GS and W1 at a ratio of 1:2 (DM basis) (W1GS) (4) GS and W1 at a ratio of 2:1 (DM basis) (GSW1), (5) whole crop wheat silage with 52% DM (W2), (6) GS and W2 at a ratio of 1:2 (DM basis) (W2GS), (7) GS and W2 at a ratio of 2:1 (DM basis) (GSW2). Within each silage treatment, 5 animals were assigned to one of three concentrate rations, differing in the content of SFO. The levels of inclusion of SFO in the concentrate were 0, 55, 110 g/kg concentrate. Inclusion of SFO in the diet led to an increase in the n-6:n-3 fatty acid ratio in muscle. In animals fed grass silage or mixed silages the n-6:n-3 ratio was lower in muscle compared with those fed whole crop wheat silages, with the exception of animals fed 55 g SFO/kg, for which feeding W1GS led to a higher ratio than W1. Other than the n-6:n-3 ratio there were no significant interactions between the effect of type of silage and the level of SFO on the concentration of fatty acids in intramuscular fat. Increasing the inclusion of SFO led to a linear increase in the CLAcis-9,trans-11 and PUFA concentration in intramuscular fat (P<0.001). This study confirmed the potential for modification, and improvement from a human health perspective, of the fatty acid composition of beef muscle by dietary manipulation."

In this study, we have investigated the effect of dendrodoine analogue (DA), DA-[4-amino-5-benzoyl-2-(4-methoxyphenylamino)-thiazole], on alcohol- and thermally oxidized sunflower oil-induced hyperlipidemia. Ethanol was given to animals at a dose of 5 ml of 20% solution and thermally oxidized sunflower oil at a level of 15% (15 g oil/100 g feed). Our results showed increased activity of aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and increased levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipids in the plasma of groups given alcohol, thermally oxidized oil and alcohol + thermally oxidized oil when compared with normal control group. The levels of tissue (liver and kidney) cholesterol and triglycerides were increased significantly in groups treated with alcohol, thermally oxidized oil and alcohol + thermally oxidized oil when compared with normal control rats. The levels were decreased when DA was given along with alcohol and thermally oxidized oil. The level of phospholipids decreased significantly in the liver and kidney of rats administered alcohol, thermally oxidized oil and alcohol + thermally oxidized oil when compared with normal control rats. The level increased when DA was administered along with alcohol and thermally oxidized oil. The activity of phospholipase A and C increased significantly in the liver of groups given alcohol, thermally oxidized oil and alcohol + thermally oxidized oil when compared with normal control rats, whereas the activity was decreased upon DA treatment. The obtained results indicate that DA can decrease the lipid levels in alcohol- and thermally oxidized oil-treated rats.",

Steers were fed one of six treatment diets in a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments (grass hay level: 12, 24, or 36% of DM; and sunflower oil level: 2 or 4% of DM) in a 6 x 6 Latin square design. The remainder of the diet was made up of steam rolled corn and protein/mineral supplement. Duodenal samples were collected for 4 d following 10-d diet adaptation periods. Data were analyzed with animal, period, forage level, sunflower oil level, and two-way interaction between forage and sunflower oil level in the model. Dry matter intake showed a quadratic response (P < 0.04), with an increase in DMI as forage level increased from 12 to 24% followed by a decrease in DMI when 36% forage was fed. Flow of fatty acids at the duodenum was higher (P < 0.03) for 4 vs. 2% sunflower oil diets, and similar among forage levels. Apparent ruminal digestibility of NDF increased in a linear manner (P < 0.04) as dietary forage level increased. Ruminal BH of dietary unsaturated 18-C fatty acids, oleic acid, and linoleic acid increased linearly (P < 0.05) as dietary forage level increased. Linoleic acid BH tended (P < 0.07) to be greater for 4 than 2% sunflower oil level. Duodenal flow of pentadecyclic, stearic, linolenic, and arachidic acids increased linearly (P < 0.05) as dietary forage level increased from 12 to 36%. Duodenal flow of linoleic acid decreased in a linear manner (P < 0.03) with increasing dietary forage level. Flow of trans-10 octadecenoate decreased linearly (P < 0.03) as dietary forage level increased, whereas trans-11 vaccenic acid flow to the duodenum increased (P < 0.01) linearly with increased dietary forage. Dietary forage or sunflower oil levels did not alter the outflow of cis-9, trans-11 CLA. Flows of cis-11, trans-13, and cis-9, cis-11 CLA increased linearly (P < 0.05) with increased dietary forage. Flows of cis-11, cis-13, and trans-11, trans-13 CLA decreased linearly (P < 0.05) with increased dietary forage. Increasing dietary forage levels from 12 to 36% in beef cattle finishing diets increased BH of unsaturated 18-C fatty acid and outflow of trans-11 vaccenic acid to duodenum without altering cis-9, trans-11 CLA outflow.",

AIM: To investigate the effect of a dietary exchange between palmitic acid and oleic acid on both platelet aggregation and thromboxane B2 (TXB(2)) production, and on urine TXB(2), prostacyclin I2 (PGI(2) as 6-keto-protaglandin F(1)alpha), and the thrombogenic ratio (TXB(2)/6-keto-protaglandin F(1)alpha) in fourteen postmenopausal women. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Women were assigned to two consecutive 28-d dietary periods that were high in cholesterol (~400 mg/d) and fat (~46%en). In the first period all subjects followed an oleic acid-rich diet prepared with high oleic acidsunflower oil. This was followed by a second period rich in palmitic acid in the form of palmolein. DETERMINATIONS: Nutrient intakes, ADP-platelet aggregation, platelet TXB(2) production, urine TXB(2) and 6-keto-protaglandin F(1)alpha were measured during two dietary periods and the results obtained correlated to serum cholesterol, lipoproteincholesterol and peroxides, apolipoproteins and plasma tocopherol. RESULTS: The palmolein diet led to an increase in the platelet aggregation rate (p < 0.05) and in the time for the maximal aggregation rate (p < 0.02). No significant differences were observed in platelet TXB(2) production. Palmolein increased urine TXB(2) in pg/mL (p < 0.05) and pg/min (p < 0.01), whereas the thrombogenic ratio (TXB(2)/6-keto-protaglandin F(1)alpha) did not change. Most changes were related to oil change, few to serum cholesterol level (< or > or = 6.2 mmol/L) or age (< or > or = 65 yr). CONCLUSIONS: Palmolein diet activates platelet aggregation more in normocholesterolemics. Though palmolein increased thromboxane and tended to increase prostacyclin in urine in normo- and hypercholesterolemic women, the thrombogenic ratio did not change. These effects were related to the LDL and HDL concentration increases and to the absence of change in the total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio found following the dietary intervention.",

AIM OF THIS STUDY: To evaluate the effects of a plant oil-mixture (olive/sunflower oil; saturated/monounsaturated/polyunsaturated (S/M/P) = 14:69:17) high in oleic acid but also showing a moderate content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in comparison with a single, PUFA rich corn oil (S/M/P = 13:33:54) used in a normal, balanced diet on human plasma and lipoprotein metabolism. METHODS: The double-blind designed study comprised 28 healthy, non-smoking young men aged between 19 and 31 years. After two weeks of adjustment (mixed, balanced diet: 11.6 MJ average, average fat intake approximately 105 g/d), the design included a two week test period in which a diet with 80 g corn oil/d vs a mixture of 68 g olive- and 12 g sunflower oil/d (total 80 g) as the main fat source was given, followed by a crossover after two weeks. Compliance and ingestion of diets were monitored by assessing the fatty acid pattern in LDL and by determination of alpha- and gamma-tocopherol in plasma and LDL. Results Diets were well incorporated due to the significant changes in plasma- and LDL-tocopherol levels and the significant different average ratio of oleic acid to linoleic acid in LDL. The PUFA-rich corn oil diet was able to reduce low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol from adjustment to T2 significantly (p < 0.01), which was also confirmed by a trend after cross over (p=0.15). Total cholesterol (only after cross over at T3), total triglycerides (TG) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG were significantly lower at T2 after the corn oil diet than after the mixed oil diet. Total high density lipoproteins (HDL) and HDL cholesterol remained unchanged by both diets. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that during the intervention of two weeks for each diet and the following cross over the corn oil diet had more influence on lipoprotein metabolism than the MUFA-rich diet. The hypocholesteremic effect of the PUFA-rich diet must also be connected with the high amount of unsaponifiable substances, mainly phytosterols in the corn oil.",

DESIGN: Ninety rural, pregnant Tanzanian women from 3 randomly selected villages were recruited during their third trimester to participate in 3 dietary intervention groups: a control group, who were encouraged to maintain the traditional practice of eating staples with dark-green leafy vegetables, and 2 study groups, who were given either sunflower or red palm oil for use in household food preparations. The intervention lasted 6 mo. Plasma samples were collected at the third trimester and 1 and 3 mo postpartum, and breast-milk samples were collected 1 and 3 mo postpartum. RESULTS: Supplementation with red palm oil, which is rich in provitamin A, increased alpha- and beta-carotene concentrations significantly (P < 0.001) in both plasma and breast milk. Plasma retinol concentrations were similar in all dietary groups. Breast-milk retinol concentrations tended to decrease from 1 to 3 mo postpartum in the control group, but were maintained in both oil groups. The difference in change in breast-milk retinol concentration between the red palm oil group and the control group was significant (P = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of red palm oil increases concentrations of alpha- and beta-carotene in both breast milk and serum and maintains breast-milk retinol concentrations. Sunflower oil consumption seems to conserve breast-milk retinol similarly to consumption of red palm oil. Breast-milk retinol might be maintained through increased dietary intake of these vegetable oils and use of mild cooking preparation methods (such as the addition of oil at the end of cooking and avoidance of frying).",

DESIGN: A randomized crossover dietary intervention. SETTING: Free living individuals. SUBJECTS: Fourteen healthy males 35 to 55 years of age and 14 healthy postmenopausal women 50 to 60 years of age completed the dietary intervention. Two subjects did not complete the study, and their data were not included. INTERVENTIONS: A low fat, high carbohydrate diet (22% to 25% of energy from total fat, 7% to 8% of energy from monounsaturated fat and 55% to 60% of energy from carbohydrate) was compared to a monounsatutated enriched sunflower oil (MO) diet (40% to 42% of energy from fat, with 26% to 28% from monounsaturated fat and 40% to 45% of energy from carbohydrate) in an isocaloric substitution. Each dietary period was one month. RESULTS: Total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose were not significantly different between the two diets. HDL cholesterol, HDL3 cholesterol and insulin were significantly higher on the MO diet, mean 7%, 7% and 17% higher respectively. Copper-induced LDL oxidation lag phase was significantly longer (mean 18%) after the MO diet compared to the low fat, high carbohydrate diet. LDL particle size was not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: The significant increase in LDL oxidation lag phase and the significantly higher HDL cholesterol on the MO diet would be expected to be associated with a decrease in CHD risk.",

Plasma cholesterol, triacylglycerol, apolipoprotein B, and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations were 10;-20% higher after consumption of the olive oil diet compared with the rapeseed oil and sunflower oil diets [analysis of variance (ANOVA), P < 0.05].

In order to investigate further the prevalence of subclinical breast inflammation and to assess the impact of dietary intervention, we studied rural Tanzanian women taking part in a study of dietary sunflower or red palm oil supplementation during late pregnancy and lactation. We measured breastmilk concentrations of IL-8, the anti-inflammatory cytokine, transforming growth factor-beta2 (TGF-beta) and the ratio of sodium to potassium. We also estimated systemic inflammation by plasma concentrations of the acute phase proteins, alpha1-acid glycoprotein and C-reactive protein. There were highly significant intercorrelations among milk Na/K ratio and concentrations of IL-8 and TGF-beta, the last only after treatment with bile salts which also improved TGF-beta recovery in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Plasma acute phase protein concentrations tended to correlate with milk Na/K ratio and IL-8, suggesting that subclinical breast inflammation was related to systemic inflammation. Dietary supplementation with vitamin E-rich sunflower oil but not provitamin A-containing red palm oil decreased milk Na/K, IL-8 and TGF-beta at 3 months postpartum; however, the effect was significant only for Na/K ratio. The results suggest that milk Na/K ratio, IL-8, and TGF-beta all measure the same phenomenon of subclinical breast inflammation but that Na/K ratio, having the lowest assay variability, is the most useful. Subclinical breast inflammation may result in part from systemic inflammation and may be improved by increased dietary intake of vitamin E-rich sunflower oil.",

Sixteen gilts were divided into two groups: eight fed a control diet containing 10 g/100 g beef tallow, and eight fed a diet containing 10 g/100 g HOSO. Plasma samples were obtained before feeding began and at 4 weeks and 8 weeks of dietary treatment. Samples were obtained from longissimus dorsi muscle, liver, adipose and duodenal mucosa for the measurement of fatty acid composition and stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity. The HOSO diet increased (P < 0.05) the concentrations (mumol/g wet weight of tissue) of 18:1 and 18:2 (n-6) in adipose tissue. In muscle from pigs fed the HOSO diet, concentrations of 14:0, 16:0, 16:1, 18:0, 18:1, and 18:2 (n-6) decreased (P < 0.05) relative to muscle from pigs fed the beef tallow diet; only 14:0 and 16:1 were reduced in liver by the HOSO diet. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase specific activity [(pmol 7 min-1 mg-1 microsomal protein)] was 40 percent lower, and activity expressed as pmol 7 min-1 g-1 tissue) was 20 percent lower, in adipose tissue of pigs fed HOSO (P < 0.05). No differences due to dietary treatment were observed for desaturase activity from muscle, liver or intestinal mucosa. Plasma triglycerides declined steadily in the tallow-fed pigs, possibly reflecting the lower percentages of liver 18:0 and 18:1 acids, relative to the HOSO-fed pigs. The animals responded similarly to the addition of fat (beef tallow or HOSO) to their diets with increased (P < 0.05) plasma total, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol by 4 weeks of treatment. Total cholesterol, LDL-, VLDL- or HDL-cholesterol were not different between pigs fed beef tallow or HOSO. Thus, differences in fatty acid composition of the diets were sufficient to alter tissue fatty acid composition and adipose tissue desaturase activity, but insufficient to alter plasma lipoprotein cholesterol.",

      "abstract": "A double-blind cross-over study was conducted during two 3-week periods to compare the effects of rapeseed oil and sunflower oil, enriching a normal diet, on the lipoprotein and fatty acid composition in healthy subjects. It was carried out in randomized order at residential schools, comprising 101 persons (mean age 29.2 years). The dietary fats used for cooking and as table margarine were prepared from rapeseed oil during one period and from sunflower oil during the other. No changes were made in the total fat content or other dietary nutrients. During both treatment periods the serum cholesterol (-4%, P < 0.001), LDL cholesterol (-5% to -7%, P < 0.01 and 0.001) and apolipoprotein B (-5%, P < 0.001) concentrations decreased significantly and to the same extent, while serum triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-1 and lipoprotein (a) remained virtually unchanged. The content of 18:2 n-6 serum phospholipids was increased after the sunflower oil-enriched diet, and the contents of oleic acid (18:1 n-9), alpha-linolenic acid (18:3 n-3), and eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 n-3) were increased after the rapeseed oil-enriched diet. The concentration of alpha-tocopherol increased and gamma-tocopherol decreased after the sunflower oil-enriched diet, less so after the rapeseed oil-enriched diet. It is concluded that substitution of mono- and polyunsaturated fats for saturated fats without any other dietary changes causes a significant improvement of the lipoprotein profile in healthy subjects. The rapeseed oil and sunflower oil fats were equally effective in this respect. The results also indicate that humans have a certain capacity to elongate and desaturate alpha-linolenic acid to 20:5 n-3 in vivo. Dietary fats based on rapeseed oil seem to be attractive alternatives to the more commonly used oils and fats rich in linoleic acid.

It has been shown that with increase in the degree of esterification of the polyuronide the efficiency of demetalization decreases. The second and third treatment of the hydrogenated oil with pectinic acid resulted in a high degree of heavy metal removal. The possibility of efficient demetalization of hydrogenated oils by treatment with water solutions of pectinic acids has also been demonstrated. The degree of metal ion removal increases with decreasing concentration of pectinic acids in the water solution.",
