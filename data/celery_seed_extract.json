      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anxiety and depression are crucial public health issues, affecting the rising in hospitalizations and death. Anxiety and depression can worsen hypertension and vice versa. OBJECTIVE: The current study has investigated the effects of celery seed extract, as a drug supplement, with the active ingredient of 3-n-butylphthalide, on mental problems primarily anxiety and secondary depression in hypertensive patients. DESIGN: The current study was a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over, 4-week clinical trial with a 4-week washout period. Fifty hypertensive patients received 4 placebo or celery seed extract capsules (1.34 g per day) for 4 weeks as a supplement to their usual medication regimen. The blood pressure parameters were assessed using 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring device. Anxiety and depression and their wide range of symptoms were evaluated using Beck anxiety and depression inventories (BAI and BDI). RESULTS: In the celery treatment step, the mean reduction in BAI and BDI scores were 6.78 (P < 0.001) and 3.63 (P < 0.01), respectively. Some symptoms of anxiety including unable to relax, nervousness, numbness, dizziness, flushed face, sweating, and breathing difficulty were significantly improved by celery consumption (P < 0.001). Celery could decrease symptoms of depression such as sadness, crying, loss of energy, insomnia, irritability, fatigue, loss of interest in sex, and punishment feeling (P < 0.01). The mean reduction in blood pressure parameters was also significant during celery therapy (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The psychometric properties of anxiety and depression were investigated and the results were promising. The results indicated the anti-anxiety and anti-depressive properties of celery seed extract as a supplement in hypertensive patients.

      "abstract": "Celery seeds are medicinal herbs used for the prevention and treatment of gout as these have the ability to inhibit the activity of xanthine oxidase and reduce the concentration of serum uric acid. In this study, the relationship between xanthine oxidase inhibitory effects and high-performance thin-layer chromatography data of celery seed extracts was established using multilayer neural network (MNN) in combination with principal component analysis (PCA). The constructed MNN-PCA model was stable and had accurate prediction ability with coefficient of determination = 0.9998, leave-one-out coefficient = 0.7371, root mean square error = 0.0025, and mean absolute deviation = 0.0019 for the training set and coefficient of determination = 0.8124, root mean square error = 0.0784, and mean absolute deviation = 0.0645 for the test set. This model can be used to identify the main compounds related to the xanthine oxidase inhibitory effect of celery seed extract. These results can be applied not only to celery extract but also to other herbal medicines.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mechanisms of apoptosis in tumor cells is an important field of tumor therapy and cancer molecular biology. Loss of cell cycle control, leading to uncontrolled proliferation, is common in cancer. Therefore, the identification of potent and selective cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors is a priority for anti-cancer drug discovery. There are at least two major apoptotic pathways, initiated by caspase-8 and caspase-9, respectively, which can activate caspase cascades. Apoptosis triggered by activation of the mitochondrial-dependent caspase pathway represents the main programmed cell death mechanism. This is activated by various intracellular stresses that induce permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane. Anti-tumor effects of celery seed extract (CSE) and related mechanisms regarding apoptosis were here investigated in human gastric cancer BGC-823 cells. METHODS: CSE was produced by supercritical fluid extraction. Cell viability was analyzed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)- 2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and apoptosis by flow cytometry using Annexin/PI staining and DAPI staining and a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM). Cell cycling was evaluated using PI staining with flow cytometry and expression of cell cycle and apoptosis-related proteins cyclin A, CDK2, bcl-2 and bax was assessed by immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: CSE had an anti-proliferation effect on human gastric cancer BGC-823 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. After treatment, the apoptotic rate significantly increased, with morphological changes typical of apoptosis observed with LSCM by DAPI staining. Cell cycle and apoptosis related proteins, such as cyclin A, CDK2 and bcl-2 were all down-regulated, whereas bax was up-regulated. CONCLUSIONS: The molecular determinants of inhibition of cell proliferation as well as apoptosis of CSE may be associated with cycle arrest in the S phase.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: An extract of the seed from celery (Apium graviolens) (CSE), and fractions thereof, have been found to possess anti-inflammatory activity, gastro-protective activity, and anti-Helicobacter pylori activity. In view of the potential for employing these extracts for therapeutic use, toxicological investigations were undertaken with an alcoholic extract (A-CSE) which has previously been shown to have the above pharmacological activities. METHODS: A 28-day toxicity study was performed in rats according to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) conditions. Eighteen adult male and 18 adult female rats were randomly assigned to 3 treatment groups of 6 rats/sex/group and were dosed orally with A-CSE of 0, 150 or 5,000 mg/kg per day. Daily observations of vital signs and body weights were recorded and ophthalmological investigations were performed. At autopsy, the principal organs were weighed and sections collected for histological analysis. Serum and urine samples were collected at termination for routine clinical chemistry. Under non-GLP conditions alpha-2-μ-globulin immunohistochemistry was performed on kidney tissues and hepatic cytochrome P450 protein was determined, as well as, the enzymatic activities of the principal isoforms. RESULTS: All animals survived treatments with no visible or behavioral signs of toxicity being observed during the study. There were no statistically significant differences in body weight gains, body weight gains per day or cumulative absolute body weight gains, for either sex, in any treatment groups when compared with controls. Slightly increased liver weight and liver to body and brain weight ratios were observed in female rats and in liver to body weight ratios in male rats given high dose A-CSE which was a test article effect, but the absence of any microscopic correlates for the liver weight increases suggests that these were not toxicologically significant. Treatment related macroscopic changes were not observed at necropsy and microscopic findings were limited to minimal increases in gastric eosinophils in several male and female rats in the 5,000 mg/kg per day treatment groups. Minimal focal degeneration of renal tubules was observed sporadically in both sexes assigned to all treatment groups including control and was consistent with early spontaneous nephropathy of laboratory rats and thus was not considered to represent a pathologic change associated with the test article. Increased serum globulin and phosphorus levels were observed in male rats given 5,000 mg/kg per day A-CSE and decreased serum triglycerides levels in female animals given 150 or 5,000 mg/kg per day A-CSE. The increase in serum globulin and phosphorus in male animals was small in magnitude and not considered toxicologically significant. The mechanism for the decrease in serum triglycerides in female rats was not apparent. Changes in urinalysis parameters were limited to small decreases in urine pH in female animals in the 150 and 5,000 mg/kg per day groups and were not deemed toxicologically significant. Alpha-2-μ-globulin immunohistochemistry was performed on kidney tissues from all animals and found to be within normal physiologic limits. Minor corneal mineralization occurred in some animals from all treatment groups. Cataracts were observed in one in the control and one in an animal that had 5,000 mg/kg per day but since the cataracts occurred in the metabolically inactive region of the lens, these were not considered indicative of test article related lesions. There were no changes in total hepatic microsomal protein or in total cytochrome P450 protein. Although male rats appeared to have to higher levels of total microsomal protein than female rats, there appeared to be no treatment effect in either male or female animals. As regards the activity of the various isoforms tested (CYP2B1/2, CYP1A1/2, CYP3A1/2), with the large range of activities detected for each P450 isoform, no clear change in activity or protein were observed, however, these data were not statistically analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that there are no toxicologically significant sub-chronic effects of oral A-CSE in rats. The no adverse effect level for systemic toxicity would appear to be 5,000 mg/kg per day.",
