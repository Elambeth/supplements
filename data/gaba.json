      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Approximately 30 % of patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) respond to ketamine; however, no replicable predictors of response have been reported. The imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmissions may be implicated in the mechanism of action of ketamine. This study aimed to evaluate whether the ratio of glutamate and glutamine (Glx) to GABA levels at baseline in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) could predict ketamine response in patients with TRD. METHOD: This exploratory study analyzed data from a double-blind randomized clinical trial with an open-label extension study (jRCTs031210124). Fifteen participants in the ketamine group and 15 of 16 participants in the placebo group received repeated intravenous ketamine during the double-blind and open-label extension periods, respectively. We measured Glx and GABA levels in the dACC before and after treatment during the double-blind period using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) was measured for depressive symptomatology. General linear models were used to examine the relationship between baseline Glx/GABA ratio and HDRS-17 score changes. RESULT: Changes in HDRS-17 scores (mean (±SD)) following ketamine treatment were -4.9 (6.5) and -4.9 (5.2) in the double-blind and open-label periods, respectively. A higher baseline dACC Glx/GABA ratio was correlated with greater improvement in HDRS-17 (β = -0.42, p = 0.040). In the ketamine group, a reduction in the dACC Glx/GABA ratio was correlated with greater HDRS-17 improvement (β = 0.74, p = 0.009) with no such association in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in the dACC may predict the efficacy of ketamine in TRD."

      "abstract": "Alprazolam, a commonly prescribed benzodiazepine (BDZ), poses a risk for abuse and has been linked to conditioned place preference (CPP). Research indicates that effective long-term treatments for alprazolam misuse are lacking. The mechanisms of tolerance and dependence for benzodiazepines are similar to those seen with alcohol, involving gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate neurotransmitter systems. Additionally, managing withdrawal symptoms and reducing relapse rates may be identical for both substances. Acamprosate's ability to reduce alcohol cravings and relapse has led this study to explore its potential as a treatment for the extinction and reinstatement of alprazolam-induced CPP. Accordingly, we evaluated the effects of different doses of acamprosate on the extinction period and reinstatement of alprazolam-induced CPP in male rats. We also assessed hippocampal gene expression of GABAA receptor (α1, α5, γ2) subunits and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NR1, NR2A, NR2B) subunits after reinstatement, given alprazolam's action on these receptors. Alprazolam (1.5 mg/kg) could induce CPP in a 14-day paradigm. Acamprosate (20, 50, and 100 mg/kg) attenuated alprazolam-induced extinction period and reinstatement (P < 0.01). At the molecular level, acamprosate reduced the gene expression of α1 (P < 0.05) while increased α5 and γ2 subunits of GABAA receptors (p < 0.01). Besides, the gene expression of NR1, NR2A, and NR2B subunits of NMDA receptors were significantly enhanced by acamprosate (P<0.001). These findings suggest that acamprosate is able to reduce the duration of extinction and reinstatement of alprazolam-induced CPP in male rats."

      "abstract": "Accumulating evidence has identified disrupted oxytocin signaling in both autistic patients and animal models of autism. Nevertheless, the specific timing of the impact of oxytocin on social behavior has remained unclear. Using mouse strains from oxytocin-Cre mice crossed with Cre-dependent chemogenetic mice, oxytocinergic neuronal activity is selectivity manipulated during the early or late postnatal stages and revealed, for the first time, that the suppression of oxytocinergic neurons in the early rather than late postnatal stage led to the emergence of autistic-like behaviors. Notably, significantly reduced oxytocin levels are identified specifically during the early postnatal stage in both valproic acid (VPA)-exposed and Fmr1-KO mouse brains, along with an impairment of the GABA reversal potential and downregulation of the Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter (NKCC1) post-birth. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of oxytocinergic neurons during the early rather than late postnatal stage effectively restored the aberrant NKCC1 expression and GABAA receptor reversal potential and consequently alleviated autistic-like behaviors in VPA-exposed mice. Overall, the results demonstrate that the early postnatal stage may be the unique critical period for oxytocin signaling to regulate GABA reversal potential and promote brain development for prosocial behaviors. These findings suggest an earlier intervention window and strategy for the clinical oxytocin treatment of autism."

      "abstract": "Gastric dysfunction is very common in depressed patients, and the coupling mechanism between the brain and the stomach is a key point in its occurrence. Electroacupuncture (EA) can act on both 'form' (i.e., the physical level) and 'spirit' (i.e., the mental-emotional level) in the treatment of negative emotions and gastrointestinal co-morbidities, realising the therapeutic effect of'form-spirit co-medication'. The neurological mechanism is not clear.We developed a chronic unpredictable stress (CUMS) model, and gastric electrophysiological and behavioural results suggest that EA can alleviate depressive symptoms and improve gastric dysfunction accompanying depression. We found that the CUMS model inhibits GABAergic neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), whereas BNSTGABA neurons are de-suppressed after EA intervention. Chemical activation of BNSTGABA neurons eliminated CUMS-induced depressive symptoms and gastric dysfunction with effects similar to EA treatment. In addition, transcriptomics data showed that excessive autophagy was present in the gastric tissues of CUMS model mice, which was alleviated by EA, and it was verified by Western Blot that EA may ameliorate depression-induced gastric dysfunction by modulating BNSTGABA neurons, which effectively inhibited excessive autophagy in the cells of gastric tissues. Thus, our study describes a neural mechanism that regulates autophagy in gastric cells via BNSTGABA neurons, thereby alleviating gastric dysfunction in depression, and provides a theoretical basis for electroacupuncture in the treatment of mood disorders with comorbid somatic symptoms."

      "abstract": "This study investigates the effects of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and proline, both individually and in combination, on the growth of oilseed rape under drought stress and following the resumption of irrigation. The goal was to determine whether the exogenous application of these compounds enhances the plants response to prolonged water deficit and, if so, to identify the biochemical processes involved in the plant tissue. The experiment was conducted under controlled laboratory conditions. After 21 days of plant cultivation, at the 3-4 leaf stage, seedlings were sprayed with aqueous solutions of GABA (0.1 mM) and proline (0.1 mM). The plants were then subjected to 8 days of severe drought stress, after which irrigation was resumed, and recovery was assessed over 4 days. The results showed that both amino acids alleviated the drought-induced stress as indicated by higher relative water content (RWC), increased levels of endogenous proline and photosynthetic pigments in leaves, and enhanced survival and growth recovery after drought. GABA-treated plants maintained membrane integrity and preserved plasma membrane (PM) ATPase activity during prolonged drought stress while reducing ethylene, H2O2, and MDA levels. Proline also influenced these biochemical responses, though to a lesser extent. The combination of GABA and proline facilitated better recovery of oilseed rape compared to the drought control group following rewatering. Notably, GABA treatment resulted in a significant increase in gene expression compared to the untreated control. Molecular analysis of drought-responsive genes revealed that the gene expression in plants treated with both proline and GABA was typically intermediate between those treated with proline alone and those treated with GABA alone. Based on these findings, we propose that GABA application could serve as an alternative to proline for improving oilseed rape's drought tolerance, potentially increasing both crop yield and quality."

      "abstract": "High-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) at subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an effective therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we find an important role of asynchronous release (AR) of GABA induced by high-frequency stimulation (HFS) in alleviating motor functions of dopamine-depleted male mice. Electrophysiological recordings reveal that 130-Hz HFS causes an initial inhibition followed by desynchronization of STN neurons, largely attributable to presynaptic GABA release. Low-frequency stimulation at 20 Hz, however, produces much weaker AR and negligible effects on neuronal firing. Further optogenetic and cell-ablation experiments demonstrate that activation of parvalbumin axons, but not non-parvalbumin axons, from external globus pallidus (GPe) is both necessary and sufficient for DBS effects. Reducing AR diminishes the high-frequency DBS effect, while increasing AR allows low-frequency DBS to achieve a therapeutic benefit. Therefore, asynchronous GABA release from GPe PV neurons may contribute significantly to the therapeutic effects of high-frequency DBS.",

      "abstract": "Sex differences in pain perception and response to analgesics are well documented, yet the underlying causes remain poorly understood. Here we investigate the sexual dimorphism in the function of α6GABAA receptors in neuropathic pain, focusing on activational and organizational actions of gonadal hormones. Using the nerve ligation model in rats, we found that the positive allosteric modulator, PZ-ll-029 (30 nmol, it), produced a robust antiallodynic effect in females but not in males. Ovariectomy abolished this effect, while a single dose of estradiol (20 μg/kg sc, -24 h), that returned to physiological serum levels, partially restored it, indicating that the activational effect of estradiol is crucial for α6GABAA receptor-mediated antiallodynia in females. Interestingly, adult or neonatal (at postnatal day 3) orchidectomy did not alter the male's insensitivity to PZ-ll-029, even after estradiol treatment. However, neonatal female's virilization (with testosterone propionate 120 μg/rat at postnatal day 3) induced a male-like insensitivity to PZ-ll-029, that was partial when the ovaries were present and complete after adult ovariectomy. These findings reveal that the neonatal organizational effects of testosterone determine the sex-specific insensitivity of α6GABAA receptors to modulate neuropathic pain, while the activational effects of estradiol can partly maintain the female-typical response, despite early androgen exposure. Our results provide new insights into hormonal regulation of pain modulation and suggest that both developmental exposure and adult status should be considered in basic research and preclinical studies investigating sex-based dimorphisms."

      "abstract": "Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a developmental abnormality of cortex commonly linked with drug-resistant seizures. Altered GABAergic activity is a key contributor to interictal discharges in FCD. In FCD, GABAA receptor associated epileptogenicity is dependent upon the age at seizure onset, as differential epileptogenic networks are observed in early and late onset FCD patients. But the contribution of GABAA receptor alteration to epileptogenic networks during development is unclear. We hypothesize that GABAergic signaling in FCD undergoes age-dependent molecular alterations, contributing to the development of distinct epileptogenic networks. In this study, we investigated age-dependent changes in GABA neurotransmitter levels, GABAA receptor α subunit expression, and GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic activity using the BCNU-rat model of FCD. GABA levels, mRNA, and protein expression of GABAA receptor α subunits were determined by HPLC, qPCR and western blot and spontaneous GABAergic activity from pyramidal neurons was recorded using whole cell patch-clamp technique. At postnatal days (P) 12 and 21, reduced expression of α1, 2 and 4 subunits were observed in FCD rats compared to control. Consistent with this, decreased amplitude and frequency of GABAergic events were observed in FCD rats. In contrast, at P30 and P65, decreased GABA levels, without changes in receptor expression, were observed in FCD rats. Consistently, reduction in the frequency of GABAergic events was observed in FCD rats compared to the control. Furthermore, treatment with tetrodotoxin (TTX) revealed that the observed alterations in GABAergic activity were predominantly action potential (AP)-dependent. Our findings indicate that distinct epileptogenic networks exist in FCD during early and late developmental stages. These networks are driven primarily by altered GABAergic activity, with early age changes linked to aberrant GABAA receptor configurations and late age changes associated with abnormal GABA levels.",

Using a combination of behavioral methods, computational modeling, fMRI, MR spectroscopy, and pharmacological intervention, we investigated the role of aging and GABA in neural variability during visual processing. We replicated previous findings that participants expressed higher variability when viewing more complex visual stimuli. Additionally, we found that such variability modulation was associated with higher baseline visual GABA levels and was reduced in older adults. When pharmacologically increasing GABA activity, we found that participants with lower baseline GABA levels showed a drug-related increase in variability modulation while participants with higher baseline GABA showed no change or even a reduction, consistent with an inverted-U account. Finally, higher baseline GABA and variability modulation were jointly associated with better visual-discrimination performance. These results suggest that GABA plays an important role in how humans utilize neural variability to adapt to the complexity of the visual world.",

Additional study advances have implied the crucial roles of GABABRs in regulating feeding-related behaviors, yet their therapeutic potential in addressing the neuropsychiatric disorders, binge eating, and feeding-related disorders remains underutilized. This general review summarized the physiological structure and functions of GABABR, explored the regulation in various psychiatric disorders, feeding behaviors, binge eating, and metabolism disorders, and fully discussed the potential of targeting GABABRs and its regulator-binding sites for the treatment of different psychiatric disorders, binge eating and even obesity. While agonists that directly bind to GABABR1 have some negative side effects, positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) that bind to GABABR2 demonstrate excellent therapeutic efficacy and tolerability and have better safety and therapeutic indexes. Moreover, phosphorylation sites of downstream GABABRs regulators may be novel therapeutic targets for psychiatric disorders, binge eating, and obesity. Further studies, clinical trials in particular, will be essential for confirming the therapeutic value of PAMs and other agents targeting the GABABR pathways in a clinical setting."

      "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental syndrome typically diagnosed in childhood that may persist into adulthood. Its etiology encompasses both genetic and environmental factors, with genetic studies indicating catecholamine dysfunction and epidemiological evidence emphasizing neuroinflammation as a potential trigger. To investigate the roles of inflammation and development processes in ADHD, we conducted a longitudinal behavioral study using female Swiss mice with a dopamine deficit model. We explored the impact of neonatal dopaminergic lesions, treatment with abscisic acid (ABA)-an anti-inflammatory hormone-and developmental changes by comparing behavioral patterns in juvenile and adult mice. Postmortem analyses assessed neuroinflammation through microglial morphology, NLRP3, cytokine expression, and the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) ratio in specific brain regions. Neonatal dopaminergic lesions induced hyperactivity and hypersensitivity in juvenile mice that persisted into adulthood. In adults, increased social interaction and memory impairment were observed in lesioned mice. Brain development mitigated impulsivity, while ABA treatment reduced locomotor activity, downregulated pain sensitivity, and influenced social interaction, although it did not completely resolve cognitive deficits in lesioned adult mice. In brain regions such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), posterior insular cortex (pIC), and hippocampus, lesions significantly altered microglial morphology. In the ACC, lesions increased IL-1β and TNFα levels, decreased Arg1 mRNA levels, and disrupted the E/I balance. Importantly, ABA treatment restored microglial morphology, normalized IL-1β and Arg1 expression and upregulated vGAT levels. This study demonstrates that dopamine deficits lead to microglia alterations and E/I imbalance, contributing to ADHD symptoms. While some symptoms improve with brain development, targeting microglial health in specific brain regions emerges as a promising therapeutic approach for managing ADHD.",

Daidzin (DZN), a naturally occurring isoflavone, has shown various pharmacological effects, including neuroprotective activities in animals. This study investigated the anticonvulsant effects of DZN with possible mechanisms of action using behavioral studies using experimental animals and in silico approaches. For this, a pentylenetetrazole (PTZ, 80 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced seizure model was applied in young broiler chicks. Treatment groups included DZN (5, 10, 20 mg/kg, p.o.), carbamazepine (CAR: 80 mg/kg, p.o.), and diazepam (DZP: 5 mg/kg, p.o.) alone and in combinations. After PTZ administration, convulsion onset, frequency, duration, and mortality rates were recorded. We also performed an in vitro study to check GABAergic activity of DZN and DZP. Additionally, molecular docking studies were performed against the GABAA receptor and voltage-gated sodium channel, along with pharmacokinetics and toxicity assessments of the test compound and the reference drugs. Results showed that DZN dose-dependently increased convulsion onset and significantly reduced convulsion frequency and duration compared to the control group (p < 0.05). The combination of DZN- 20 with CAR- 80 and DZP- 5 significantly enhanced convulsion onset and protection rates while reducing convulsion frequency and durations compared to their individual treatment groups. Both DZP and DZN also showed a concentration-dependent GABA activity inhibition capacity. DZN showed the highest binding affinities with GABAA receptor (- 7.8 kcal/mol) and voltage-gated sodium channel (- 9.1 kcal/mol) than the standard drugs. It also supported acceptable pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles in in silico studies. Taken together, DZN exerted and enhanced the anticonvulsant effects of CAR and DZP, possibly through GABAA receptor and voltage-gated sodium channel interaction pathways."

This study aims to investigate the effects of combined freeze-thaw and Cu stress on the physiological characteristics of rye seedlings and to assess the potential of exogenous GABA in mitigating these effects. The results indicated that root length, shoot length, fresh weight, and dry weight of rye seedlings were significantly reduced under combined stress, indicating synergistic inhibition. Combined stress impaired photosynthesis, increased MDA and H2O2 levels, and reduced endogenous GABA, thereby exacerbating physiological damage in rye seedlings. Treatment with exogenous GABA effectively alleviated growth inhibition and enhanced photosynthesis. Furthermore, exogenous GABA underscores its role in adaptation to combined stress by increasing soluble protein content, activating the antioxidant system, regulating GABA metabolism, and enhancing metal detoxification capacity, thereby improving stress tolerance. This finding not only contributes to enhancing the stability of grassland ecosystems but also provides a theoretical foundation for the future application of GABA in agricultural production, particularly in crop protection under environmental pollution and extreme climatic conditions.",

AIM: This study investigates HYF's impact on enhancing ovarian follicles development via GABA/GnRH neuron regulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chemical components of water extract of HYF were analyzed by combining the ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with Q-Exactive mass spectrum analysis (UHPLC-QE-MS). Female SD rats received HYF for 90 days to assess changes in the ovarian function. In addition, female SD rats underwent ovariectomy to evaluated the impact of HYF or GABA treatments on LH release induced by E2 to address age-related neuroendocrine damage. Reproductive neuroendocrine markers were analyzed through immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: HYF treatment improved the disrupted estrous cycle in aged female rats, breaking the continuous keratinized epithelial cell state and alternating between estrous periods. Aging reduces ovarian volume and follicle numbers, but after 3 months of HYF treatment, ovarian follicle development increased, and mature follicle and luteum numbers changed significantly. HYF improved sex hormone levels, advancing and enhancing the LH peak in older rats, thus boosting total 24-hour LH release. GABA injection into the lateral ventricle increased GnRH release in aging rats, highlighting GABA's excitatory role. HYF also increased GnRH secretion by reducing GAT-1, leading to more GABA release, which activates GABAAR2 receptors in GnRH neurons, enhancing their function in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus of elderly rats. CONCLUSION: HYF shows promise as a treatment for improving ovarian and reproductive neuroendocrine function in early reproductive aging, providing insights into its effects on hypothalamic GnRH/LH pulse release via the GAT-1/GABA/GABAAR2/GnRH pathway.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Tourette syndrome (TS) is a common chronic neuropsychiatric disorder with a prevalence of approximately 1% in children and adolescents. TS is characterized by sudden involuntary motor tics along with vocal tics. A pathological study on postmortem patients has reported a 50-60% reduction in striatal gamma-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) interneurons, suggesting a role for GABAergic system imbalances in tic disorder development. However, the effect of exogenous GABA administration on tic alleviation remains unreported. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim to investigate the therapeutic effects of exogenous GABA on TS-like behaviors in Sprague-Dawley rats and explore its potential mechanisms, including gut microbiota regulation, oxidative stress mitigation, and restoration of GABA-glutamate balance, to provide insights into TS pathogenesis and alternative treatment strategies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TS model rat was established through intraperitoneal administration of 3,3-Iminodipropionitrile (150 mg/kg/day), followed by GABA (20 mg/kg/day) administration by gavage. 15 minutes of behavioral testing (stereotypical behavior and head twitching behavior) was then conducted. 16S rRNA sequencing identified microbiome changes, and LC-MS assessed striatal metabolite changes. RESULTS: The results showed that a 4-week GABA treatment alleviated TS-like behavior in rats. GABA treatment led to an increase in Acinetobacter and other beneficial bacteria. GABA also significantly upregulated 15 striatal metabolites compared with TS group. By correlation analysis of striatal metabolites and intestinal bacteria, statistical analysis showed that Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 was negatively correlated with metabolites on the top 20 differential gut microbiota and metabolites. Moreover, changes in gut microbiota correlated with alterations in striatal metabolites, suggesting a gut-brain axis involvement. CONCLUSION: Exogenous GABA alleviated TS-like behavior in rats by reducing harmful gut flora and modulating striatal GABA-glutamate metabolism. Despite challenges like low blood-brain barrier permeability and dose safety in humans, GABA's therapeutic potential may be realized through prodrug development and optimized dosing. These findings are preliminary and require further clinical validation."

However, the effects of PTE on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated (GABAergic) nervous system are poorly understood. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of PTE on the GABAergic neurons. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Male Long-Evans rats were orally administered PTE (200 mg/kg, 5 % Tween 80 in saline) for 10 days using a plastic sonde. The control group was treated with 5 % Tween 80 in saline in a similar manner. Approximately 24 h after the last treatment, we fixed and removed the brains and examined GABA, GAD67, and GAD65 expression in the hippocampal layers using immunohistochemical analysis. In addition, changed GAD expression was compared between the two main GABAergic subtypes, PV+ and SOM+ cells. KEY RESULTS: We demonstrated that PTE treatment increased GABA expression in the hippocampus. These effects can be attributed to GAD67-mediated GABA synthesis in the PV+ cells. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results uncovered that PTE increased GABA synthesis, suggesting that PTE has potential as a prophylactic drug for patients at risk of developing epilepsy.",

Thirty-five male subjects with T1D (≥ 5 years) were randomized into three arms receiving the study drug(s) once daily for 6 months: GABA 200 mg (Arm 1), GABA 600 mg (Arm 2) and GABA 600 mg + alprazolam 0.5 mg for 3 months followed by GABA 600 mg alone for 3 months (Arm 3). Safety measures, hormonal counter-regulation during hypoglycemic clamps, fasting- and stimulated C-peptide levels, were assessed at multiple timepoints. Safety concerns included elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in nine subjects, leading to the withdrawal of two subjects. Most elevations were, however, transient with no dose-differences. No effects were observed on fasting- or stimulated C-peptide levels, CGM metrics or HbA1c. Hypoglycemic hormonal counter-regulation was unaltered. To conclude, we found no clinical evidence of a beta-cell regenerative effect of GABA, but side effects were commonly observed.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cadmium (Cd) pollution lead to ecological problems and cause severe damages to plants. Investigating the signal response to Cd is crucial for improving Cd resistance during phytoremediation. While γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is known to accumulate rapidly under environmental stress, the real-time dynamics of GABA signaling and its mechanistic link to stress adaptation remain poorly understood. METHODS: In this study, a sensitive GABA biosensor, iGABASnFR, was introduced into plants for the first time to monitor GABA signaling. Additionally, glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), a key enzyme catalyzing the conversion of glutamate (Glu) to GABA, was overexpressed in duckweed. The responses of GABA in extracellular vesicles (EVs) under Cd stress were analyzed using iGABASnFR transgenic duckweed. Cd accumulation, photosynthesis, and antioxidant activity were evaluated in GAD-overexpressing duckweed. RESULTS: (1) GABA in extracellular vesicles of duckweed exhibited a dynamic response to Cd stress, as visualized by iGABASnFR transgenic duckweed. GABA content in EVs was significantly enhanced under Cd treatment. (2) GAD-overexpressing duckweed demonstrated improved photosynthetic efficiency and enhanced antioxidant capacity during Cd stress. (3) Cd accumulation was significantly increased in GAD transgenic duckweed, as evidenced by Cd2+ flux measurements, total Cd content, and Cd staining in protoplasts using FlowSight imaging. DISCUSSION: This study provides novel insights into the role of GABA in extracellular vesicles during Cd stress and establishes a direct link between GABA signal and Cd stress adaptation. The findings demonstrate that GAD overexpression enhances Cd resistance and accumulation in duckweed, offering a potential strategy for improving phytoremediation efficiency. This work advances our understanding of GABA signaling dynamics and its application in Cd stress."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with excitatory-inhibitory imbalance and oxidative stress. GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, and related nutritional therapies are promising in restoring these imbalances. GABAergic deficits and glutamate excitotoxicity are two essential signaling pathways that could be addressed to treat autism, thus medications targeting these pathways are critical for treating behavioral symptoms. In a rat model of autism produced by propionic acid (PPA), this study assessed the effects of GABA supplementation and combined nutritional therapy (probiotics, vitamin D3) and β-lactam as an activator of glutamate transporter. METHODS: Sixty rats were randomly assigned into six groups: Group I (Control), Group II (PPA-treated), Group III (Control-GABA), Group IV (Control-Combination), Group V (PPA-GABA), and Group VI (PPA-Combination). Social behavior was evaluated using the three-chamber test. Selected biochemical variables related to oxidative stress (GST, Catalase, Lipid peroxides, GSH and Vitamin C), GABA and glutamate signaling (EAAT2, KCC2, NKCC1, GABA, VD3, Glutamate and GABRA5) were measured in the brain homogenates of the six groups. The hippocampus was examined histopathologically to assess cellular integrity. RESULTS: The obtained data revealed that PPA treatment caused significant oxidative stress and neurotransmitter imbalances, characterized by reduced GABA and elevated glutamate levels. GABA supplementation alone produced moderate benefits in biochemical and behavioral markers, but combined therapy considerably restored GABA levels, reduced oxidative stress, and enhanced social interaction behaviors. Histopathology revealed that combination therapy mitigated neurodegenerative changes induced by PPA, preserving hippocampal cellular structure. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that combined therapy (GABA, probiotics, vitamin D3, and β-lactam) were more effective than GABA alone in enhancing neurochemical balance and lowering oxidative stress in a PPA-induced mouse model of autism, indicating promise for treating symptoms."

      "abstract": "Apigenin is a flavonoid compound found in many fruits, vegetables, and medicinal herbs. It possesses a wide range of biological activities including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and neuroprotective effects. Some initial evidence also suggests that apigenin may have antiseizure properties. In this study, we aimed at providing more insight into the potential influence of apigenin on seizure susceptibility in mice and its influence on parvalbumin and GABAA receptor immunoreactivity (PV-IR and GABAAR-IR) in the hippocampus. We also assessed the pharmacokinetic profile of apigenin after intraperitoneal route of administration and its possible side effects. Acute administration of apigenin, at doses of 100 and 150 mg/kg, significantly increased the threshold for various types of seizures, i.e., the myoclonic twitch in the ivPTZ test, the 6 Hz-induced seizure, and hindlimb tonus in the maximal electroshock seizure test. A 14-day treatment with apigenin at a lower dose of 50 mg/kg also increased the threshold for maximal electroshock-induced seizures. Pharmacokinetic profiling revealed a very slow elimination of apigenin from serum, and even slower from the brain, after intraperitoneal administration. In consequence, a relatively high accumulation of this compound in the brain can be expected. In addition, apigenin given repeatedly increased the mean number of GABAAR-IR and PV-IR neurons in hippocampal fields suggesting its potential influence on neuronal Ca2+ metabolism. This study indicates that apigenin has a relatively minor effect on acute seizures in mice. However, modifying the quantity of GABAAR-IR and PV-IR hippocampal neurons provides further support for the neuroprotective effects of apigenin.",

      "abstract": "GABA (γ-Aminobutyric Acid), a well-established inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, has garnered considerable interest for its potential role in diabetes management, particularly due to its presence in pancreatic islets. This review aims to explore the therapeutic role of GABA in diabetes management and its potential mechanisms for antidiabetic effects. Relevant studies were searched across databases such as PubMed and ScienceDirect, applying strict eligibility criteria focused on GABA administration methods and diabetic models. The collective results showed that the administration of GABA in diabetic models resulted in remarkable enhancements in glucose and insulin homeostasis, favorable modifications in lipid profiles, and amelioration of dysfunctions across neural, hepatic, renal, and cardiac systems. The findings from the literature demonstrated that GABAergic signaling within pancreatic tissues can significantly contribute to the stimulation of β cell proliferation through the facilitation of a sustained trans-differentiation process, wherein glucagon-secreting α cells are converted into insulin-secreting β-like cells. In addition, activated GABAergic signaling can trigger the initiation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway within pancreatic tissues, leading to improved insulin signaling and maintained glucose homeostasis. GABAergic signaling can further function within hepatic tissues, promoting inhibitory effects on the expression of genes related to gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis. Moreover, GABA may enhance gut microbiota diversity by attenuating gut inflammation, attributable to its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Furthermore, the neuroprotective effects of GABA play a significant role in ameliorating neural disorders associated with diabetes by facilitating a substantial reduction in neuronal apoptosis. In conclusion, GABA emerges as a promising candidate for an antidiabetic agent; however, further research is highly encouraged to develop a rigorously designed framework that comprehensively identifies and optimizes the appropriate dosages and intervention methods for effectively managing and combating diabetes.",

      "abstract": "GABA serves as the major metabolite and signaling molecule for plant growth and development under fluctuating environmental conditions. In the present study, the effect of different concentrations of GABA (0, 0.25, 0.5, or 0.75 mM) as foliar spray or seed soaking treatment on K-21 and S-22 varieties of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) under normal and NaCl stress (150 mM) was studied. At 40 days after transplantation (DAT), NaCl stress impaired the photosynthetic apparatus, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and reduced photosynthetic traits and related enzymes, and consequently compromised plant growth and development. However, among the different concentrations of GABA tested 0.5 mM of GABA applied through foliar mode proved best in improving growth, photosynthetic traits (like PN of K-21 and S-22 varieties by 39.17% and 30.35%, gs by 40.11% and 32.37%; Ci by 39.48% and 33.67%; E by 37.98% and 30.08% respectively, compared to control group) and enzyme activities (Rubisco, succinate dehydrogenase, and fumarase activity) maintained organization of chloroplast in the leaves and also improved lycopene and β-carotene contents in fruits of tomato plants. Moreover, treatment of GABA (0.5 mM) reduced levels of ROS (such as decreased the contents of O2·- by 38.10% and 34.05%; and H2O2 by 35.95% and 30.36% respectively, in K-21 and S-22 varieties, as compared to their control) and cell death compared to non-treated tomato plants. Foliar application of GABA (0.5 mM) also was more effective than seed soaking to overcome the adverse effects of salt stress specifically in K-21 than S-22 variety. This study addresses this gap and uniquely investigates role of GABA in regulating photosynthetic (Rubisco), GABA shunt, and respiratory (fumarase, succinate dehydrogenase) enzyme activities under salt stress, offering new insights into its multifaceted stress-mitigating potential.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Epilepsy is a common chronic and recurrent neurological disorder that poses a threat to human health, and Acorus tatarinowii Schott (ATS), a traditional Chinese medicine, is used to treat it. This study aimed to determine its effects on plasma metabolites. Moreover, the possible mechanism of its intervention in epilepsy was preliminarily explored, combined with network pharmacology. METHODS: An epileptic model of rats was established using pentylenetetrazol. The potential targets and pathways of ATS were predicted by network pharmacology. Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Quadrupole-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometrynce Liquid Chromatography-Quadrupole-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometryance Liquid Chromatography-Quadrupole-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry and statistical analyses were used to profile plasma metabolites and identify ATS's effects on epilepsy. RESULTS: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis revealed that ATS was involved in regulating multiple signaling pathways, mainly including the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and GABAerGamma-aminobutyrate transaminaseAminobutyrate Transaminaseapse signaling pathway. ATS treatment restored 19 metabolites in epiGamma-aminobutyrate transaminaseminobutyrate Transaminase rats, affecting lysine, histidine, and purine metabolism. GABA-T was found as a new key target for treating epilepsy with ATS. The IC50 of ATS for inhibiting GABA-T activity was 57.9 μg/mL. Through metabolomic analysis, we detected changes in the levels of certain metabolites related to the GABAergic system. These metabolite changes can be correlated with the targets and pathways predicted by network pharmacology. One of the limitations of this study is that the correlation analysis between altered metabolites and seizure severity remains unfinished, which restricts a more in-depth exploration of the underlying biological mechanisms. In the future, our research will focus on conducting a more in-depth exploration of the correlation analysis between altered metabolites and seizure severity. CONCLUSIONS: These results improved our understanding of epilepsy and ATS treatment, potentially leading to better therapies. The identification of key metabolites and their associated pathways in this study offers potential novel therapeutic targets for epilepsy. By modulating these metabolites, future therapies could be designed to better manage the disorder. Moreover, the insights from network pharmacology can guide the development of more effective antiepileptic drugs, paving the way for improved clinical outcomes for patients."

The study objective was to examine developmental outcomes at 10 months and 2-3 yr of age after general anaesthesia planned for >2 h in the first 2 months of life. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of the General Anaesthesia & Brain Activity (GABA) study-a prospective, single-centre, longitudinal observational study. The final dataset included 59 children who were unexposed and 31 children who were exposed to early prolonged general anaesthesia who completed the primary outcome measure, Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-III (BSID) assessments at 10 months, at 2-3 yr old, or both. Analyses used adjusted Welch's t-tests, linear regression, and linear mixed effects models. RESULTS: BSID composite scores for cognition were similar between general anaesthesia and unexposed cohorts at 10 months (P adj=0.566, standardised mean difference [SMD]=0.27) and at 2-3 yr (P adj=0.651, SMD=0.25). Motor and language scores were similar between cohorts at 10 months (motor: P adj=1, SMD=0.13; language: P adj=0.806, SMD=0.19) and fell within typical reference ranges. Linear regression analysis found no association between BSID cognition scores and cumulative hours of general anaesthesia at 10 months (R=0.06, P=0.635) or at 2-3 yr (R=-0.13, P=0.293). CONCLUSIONS: Children with early prolonged general anaesthesia showed BSID scores comparable to age-matched controls. This analysis provides additional preliminary support for the safety of general anaesthesia on the developing brain even when general anaesthesia is prolonged, repeated, or administered very early in life."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: γ-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) that lack α-subunit selectivity, including benzodiazepines such as diazepam, exhibit antiseizure actions in animal models and in humans. ENX-101 is a deuterated analog of the ⍺2,3,5-selective GABAA receptor PAM L-838,417. The purpose of this study was to characterize the α-subunit selectivity of ENX-101 and evaluate its antiseizure potential in preclinical seizure and epilepsy models. METHODS: ENX-101 potentiation of GABA chloride current responses in cells expressing recombinant GABAA receptors were evaluated using an automated patch clamp assay. Antiseizure effects of ENX-101 were examined in the mouse 6 Hz test at 32 and 44 mA, amygdala kindled rats, and Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rat from Strasbourg (GAERS). RESULTS: ENX-101 displayed partial PAM activity with respect to diazepam at GABAA receptors containing α2, α3, or α5 subunits but did not enhance GABA responses of GABAA receptors containing α1 subunits. ENX-101 (30, 100, and 300 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam protected most animals in the 6 Hz model at 32 mA but was less effective at 44 mA. In amygdala kindled rats, ENX-101 (1-100 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced behavioral seizure severity and afterdischarge duration in a dose-dependent manner. ENX-101 (0.075-100 mg/kg, p.o.) caused dose-dependent, persistent (>130 min) inhibition of spontaneous spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) in GAERS, whereas diazepam transiently inhibited discharges. ENX-101 did not cause motor impairment, as measured by performance in the rotarod assay. SIGNIFICANCE: ENX-101 is an α2,α3,α5-selective GABAA receptor PAM that has high potency and partial efficacy. The drug is highly effective in rodent seizure and epilepsy models. ENX-101 is most potent in the GAERS model of absence epilepsy, and active in the 6 Hz model and amygdala kindled rats. These results demonstrate that a partial, subtype-selective GABAA receptor PAM has activity in translationally validated preclinical epilepsy screening models. Clinical evaluation of ENX-101 as a treatment for focal and generalized epilepsies is warranted."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Wolfram syndrome (WS) is a rare autosomal disorder caused by WFS1 gene mutations, currently lacking approved treatments. Preclinical and clinical reports suggest that diabetes medications, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP1-RA), slow WS-related diabetes and neurodegeneration, improving patient outcomes. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has crucial role in pancreatic islet function and blood glucose regulation. However, its specific role in WS diabetic pathophysiology has never been explored. The aim of this study was to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of liraglutide in mitigating the progression of diabetes associated with WS through supplementation with GABA. METHODS: In this study, 5-month-old glucose intolerant WS rats and their wild-type littermates where daily treated with GABA (1 g/kg/day), liraglutide (0.4 mg/kg/day), or a combination of both. During the four-month experimental period, the diabetic phenotype was closely monitored using intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IPGTT) and corresponding hormone measurements via enzyme-linked immunoassay. Following the treatments, immunohistochemical staining was performed to examine the morphology, cellular distribution, and health of Langerhans islets. RESULTS: Unlike in conventional diabetes models, GABA monotherapy alone had no significant effect on the diabetic phenotype in WS rats. In contrast, liraglutide monotherapy effectively delayed diabetes progression. Remarkably, the combined therapy of GABA and liraglutide reversed the diabetic phenotype, significantly enhancing glucose homeostasis, as well as insulin and C-peptide secretion. The combined treatment also increased β-cell mass and corrected the pancreatic Langerhans intra-islet ratio of α-, β-, and δ-cells. As a result, the overall morphology and cytoarchitecture of the pancreatic islets were fully restored, suggesting a potential role for these agents in preserving islet integrity. Additionally, both liraglutide and combination therapy increased the number of GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase) 65/67-positive β-cells in WS rats, indicating an improvement in general β-cell health. CONCLUSION: GABA monotherapy had no significant effect on the diabetic phenotype in WS rats, while liraglutide monotherapy effectively delayed diabetes progression. However, the combination therapy of GABA and liraglutide demonstrated a markedly superior effect, not only reversing the diabetic phenotype but also significantly enhancing glucose homeostasis, insulin and C-peptide secretion, and β-cell mass. This combined treatment led to a restoration of Langerhans islet architecture, correction of the endocrine cell proportions, and a notable increase in GAD65/67-positive β-cells, indicating improved β-cell health and function. These findings provide strong evidence supporting the evaluation of GABA and GLP-1 RAs as a combination therapy in clinical trials. Their synergistic effects may offer enhanced β-cell protection, promote functional recovery, and uncover novel therapeutic pathways for treating patients with WS."

However, its benefits on cerebral paroxysmal activity as an anticonvulsant treatment remain unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the anticonvulsant effect of B. arborea and one of its abundant isolated metabolites dihydrosanguinarine (DHS) by means of experimental models of seizures in mice simultaneously to an electrocorticographic (ECoG) analysis. B. arborea was prepared as extracts with different polarity using hexane (HEX), dichloromethane (DCM), and methanol (MeOH) solvents to choose the most active one and to identify and isolate a bioactive metabolite. DHS was purified from the HEX extract. The anticonvulsant activity was evaluated with each extract giving an intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of 100 mg/kg, and 30 min after, seizure behavior was induced by the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ, 85 mg/kg, i.p.) or maximal electroshock stimulation (MES) tests in mice. Molecular docking analysis was performance to reinforce the possible mechanism of action. Our results of seizure behavior and ECoG analysis showed that the HEX extract significantly (p < 0.0001) delayed the onset of seizures and decreased the incidence (p < 0.005) with lower mortality rate (p < 0.05), where DHS was partially responsible for this activity with a possible GABAergic mechanism of action involving the BDZ allosteric site. The MeOH extract also produced a significant effect (p < 0.05) but with less intensity than the HEX extract in the PTZ-induced seizures. A similar anticonvulsant response was observed in the MES test in the presence of DHS (p < 0.005) and the HEX extract (p < 0.05), but not in the case of the MeOH extract. In conclusion, our study provides evidence that non-polar and polar constituents of B. arborea participate in its anticonvulsant property, where DHS might play an important role in the therapy of convulsions mediated by GABAA/BDZ receptor modulation."

Using proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H-MRS), this study aimed to determine whether lower pretreatment GABA and Glx levels in the medial frontal cortex, a region implicated in MDD pathophysiology, are associated with better antidepressant treatment response. Participants with MDD (N = 74) were antidepressant naïve or medication-free for at least three weeks before imaging. Two MEGA-PRESS 1H-MRS acquisitions were collected, interleaved with a water unsuppressed reference scan. GABA and Glx concentrations were quantified from an average difference spectrum, with preprocessing using Gannet and spectral fitting using TARQUIN. Following imaging, participants were randomized to escitalopram or placebo for 8 weeks in a double-blind design. Multivariable logistic regression models were applied with treatment type and age as covariates. Bayes Factor hypothesis testing was used to interpret the strength of the evidence. No significant association was found between pretreatment Glx, GABA, or Glx/GABA and depression remission status or the continuous outcome, percent change in symptom severity. In an exploratory analysis, no significant correlation was found between pretreatment Glx, GABA or Glx/GABA and days to response. Bayes factor analysis showed strong evidence towards the null hypotheses in all cases. To date, there are no replicated biomarkers in psychiatry. To address this, well-powered, placebo-controlled trials need to be undertaken and reported. The present analysis suggests pretreatment GABA, Glx, or their ratio cannot predict antidepressant treatment response.

      "abstract": "Background: Neuropathic pain can be triggered by chemotherapy drugs such as paclitaxel (PTX). Management of pain is limited by drugs' ineffectiveness and adverse effects. Isopulegol (ISO) is a monoterpene present in the essential oils of several aromatic plants and has promising pharmacological activities. Objectives: to evaluate the antinociceptive activity of ISO in a PTX-induced neuropathic pain model. Methods: the toxicity of ISO was evaluated in healthy and cancerous cells. Behavioral assessments were performed using the von Frey and acetone tests. We investigated the involvement of the GABAergic pathway, NMDA, TNF-α, and the release of GABA and glutamate in the presence of ISO. Results: ISO showed little or no cytotoxicity in U87 and MDA-MB-231 cells. In both acute and subacute treatment, ISO at doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg (* p < 0.05) increased the mechanical nociceptive threshold of neuropathic animals compared to the control group and reduced thermal sensitivity. Its action was reversed by pre-treatment with flumazenil and potentiated by the NMDA antagonist, MK-801. TNF-α and glutamate levels were reduced and GABA release was increased in the tests carried out. Conclusions: ISO shows low toxicity in neuronal cells and its association with PTX generated synergism in its cytotoxic action. The antinociceptive effect of ISO is due to activation of GABA and antagonism of NMDA receptors and involves the stabilization of neuronal plasma membranes leading to an imbalance in the release of neurotransmitters, favoring GABA-mediated inhibition over glutamatergic excitation."

BCAT1 inhibitors represent a potential class of therapeutic agents for cancers; however, none have yet progressed to clinical development. Our earlier research identified WQQ-345 as a novel BCAT1 inhibitor featuring a unique bridged bicyclic skeleton and demonstrating both in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity against tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistant lung cancer with high BCAT1 expression. In the present study, we proceeded to modify the structure of WQQ-345 by two-round structure-activity relationship (SAR) exploration, leading to the discovery of a bicyclo[3.2.1]octene-bearing GABA derivative 7. Compound 7 exhibited a 6-fold enhancement in BCAT1 enzymatic inhibitory activity compared to the parent compound WQQ-345 and could effectively suppress the growth of 67R cells that highly expressed BCAT1 and was resistant to third-generation TKIs. GABA derivatives are an important chemical class of BCAT1 inhibitors, and therefore, the findings in the present study represent great progress both in the discovery of potent BCAT1 inhibitors with new chemical structures and in the treatment of cancer resistance.",

      "abstract": "γ-aminobutyric acid, a critical neurotransmitter, is experiencing an increasing demand in the medical and health fields. Conventional processes for γ-aminobutyric acid purification from fermentation broth encounter significant challenges, such as high ethanol usage, low yield, complex process flow, and environmental pollution. Therefore, a purification process based on crystallization techniques was developed to address the above issues. The process was implemented in two stages: desalination and γ-aminobutyric acid treatment. Na2SO4 was effectively removed through a cooling crystallization technique. γ-aminobutyric acid with a purity of 98.66% and a yield of 67.32% was further obtained through a designed \"antisolvent-cooling\" crystallization process in a 3.2 L system. Moreover, the new process reduced ethanol usage compared to conventional processes, streamlined the purification process flow, and was more environmentally sustainable. Furthermore, we established an industrial-scale model for γ-aminobutyric acid production. Techno-economic analysis indicates that an investment in a plant with an annual capacity of 74.16 tons of γ-aminobutyric acid is projected to achieve payback in 1.98 years. In conclusion, the crystallization-based purification process is poised for industrial-scale γ-aminobutyric acid production due to its high efficiency, economic viability, energy conservation, and environmental compatibility.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Reduced cortical inhibition mediated by GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is reported in depression, anxiety disorders, and aging. A novel positive allosteric modulator that specifically targets the α5-GABAA receptor subunit (α5-PAM), ligand GL-II-73 shows anxiolytic, antidepressant, and procognitive effects without the common side effects associated with nonspecific modulation by benzodiazepines such as diazepam, thus suggesting novel therapeutic potential. However, it is unknown whether α5-PAM has detectable signatures in clinically relevant brain electroencephalography (EEG). METHODS: We analyzed EEG in 10 freely moving rats at baseline and following injections of α5-PAM (GL-II-73) and diazepam. RESULTS: We showed that α5-PAM specifically decreased theta peak power, whereas diazepam shifted peak power from high to low theta while increasing beta and gamma power. EEG decomposition showed that these effects were periodic and corresponded to changes in theta oscillation event duration. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, our study shows that α5-PAM has robust and distinct EEG biomarkers in rodents, indicating that EEG could enable noninvasive monitoring of α5-PAM treatment efficacy."

      "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a multifactorial disorder of the gut-brain axis, characterized by visceral hypersensitivity (VH). Psychobiotics, through GABA synthesis, are good candidates to alleviate gastrointestinal discomfort. Here, we analyzed the GABA-producer Lactococcus lactis CNCM I-5388 as an active-enzyme postbiotic to relieve VH mediated by psychological stress. L. lactis CNCM I-5388 was inactivated by ethanol while maintaining its glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) activity. This EtOH-treated nonviable form was given daily orally for 1, 5, or 10 days to female Wistar rats in comparison with viable L. lactis CNCM I-5388 or vehicle. Visceral sensitivity was measured by electromyography before and after partial restraint stress (PRS). GABA was quantified in the stomach collected from rats and in the gastric compartment of TIM-1 human gut model in fed state. A daily treatment for 5 and 10 days by L. lactis CNCM I-5388 both in its viable and nonviable forms counteracted VH promoted by PRS. However, only viable L. lactis CNCM I-5388 tended to reduce VH after a single administration. After 5-day treatment, only under PRS conditions, the production of GABA within the stomach was enhanced in rats treated with viable or nonviable L. lactis CNCM I-5388. This increase was confirmed by using the TIM-1 human gut model. We found that a postbiotic with an active-GAD enzyme of L. lactis CNCM I-5388, similarly to its viable psychobiotic form, exerts anti-VH properties in an IBS-like rat model. These effects are associated with GABA production in the stomach where the low pH promotes GAD activity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies have reported the use of a hypertonic saline solution (HSS) for the treatment of hypotensive hemorrhage (HH). Despite the established role of central mechanisms in the cardiovascular recovery induced by HSS during HH, the involvement of the Subfornical Organ (SFO) in these responses remains to be elucidated. The present study evaluated the role of SFO and adrenergic neurotransmission in the nucleus in the cardiovascular responses to HSS infusion in hemorrhagic rats. METHODS: Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and aortic vascular resistance (AVR) were recorded in Wistar rats. HH was performed through blood withdrawal until a MAP of 60 mmHg was attained. Nanoinjections of saline (NaCl; 0.15 M; control group; n = 7), muscimol (4 mM; GABAergic agonist; muscimol group; n = 7), or propranolol (10 mM; non-selective β-adrenergic blocker; propranolol group; n = 7) in SFO were performed 10 min after the onset of blood withdrawal, followed by HSS infusion (NaCl; 3 M; 1.8 ml∙kg-1) 20 min after the beginning of HH. RESULTS: Hypotension, bradycardia, and aortic vasoconstriction were observed in all groups During HH. Sodium overload reestablished MAP and HR while maintaining aortic vasoconstriction in the control group. Activation of GABA A receptors or β-adrenergic receptor blockade in the SFO prevents HSS-induced recovery of MAP and HR. In addition, maintenance of aortic vasoconstriction induced by HSS infusion was abolished by SFO inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the integrity of SFO neurons and β-adrenergic neurotransmission are essential for cardiovascular recovery promoted by sodium overload in hemorrhagic rats.",

      "abstract": "Emerging evidence indicates that dysfunction of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and GABA demonstrates potential in the management of PCOS symptoms. This systematic review aimed to determine the role of the GABAergic pathway in PCOS and evaluate the impact of GABA on improving the condition. Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, and PubMed databases were systematically searched for experimental studies, clinical trials, animal studies, and cellular investigations. The search was conducted for relevant English-language manuscripts, published up to February 2024, using keywords, such as \"polycystic ovary syndrome\", PCOS, \"gamma-aminobutyric acid\" and GABA. Quality assessment of the included studies was performed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The results indicate that GABAergic dysfunction adversely affects gonadotrophin-releasing hormone neuronal activity, leading to hormonal imbalances and reproductive issues. Prenatal androgen exposure and kisspeptin signaling influence GABAergic transmission to GnRH neurons, thereby linking GABA to the pathogenesis of PCOS. Additionally, GABAergic signaling affects peripheral tissues relevant to PCOS, including the immune system, gut-brain axis, and ovaries. GABA supplementation has demonstrated potential benefits in enhancing metabolic and reproductive health, such as reducing insulin resistance and modulating sex hormone levels, as supported by animal models and clinical studies involving females with PCOS. The GABAergic signaling pathway may represent a promising therapeutic target for the management of PCOS. Nevertheless, further studies are required to validate these findings and deepen our understanding of the role of GABA in the pathogenesis and treatment of PCOS."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The occurrence of ischemic stroke is closely associated with the inflammatory infiltration of peripheral monocytes/macrophages, and the inflammatory activation of macrophages is often affected by metabolic reprogramming. The Slc25a1 regulates mitochondrial citrate transport and has been shown to affect cell proliferation and migration in cancer. Astragaloside IV exhibits significant anti-inflammatory activity and improves ischemic stroke, but its regulatory effect on macrophage metabolic reprogramming has not been elucidated. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to explore the effect of astragaloside IV on ischemic stroke injury from the perspective of Slc25a1-mediated cellular metabolic reprogramming. METHODS: A total of 170 mice were used to establish the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. The therapeutic effect of astragaloside IV was evaluated by neurobehavioral scores and infarct volume, with its impact further verified through the depletion of peripheral macrophages. The modulation of Slc25a1 by astragaloside IV and its influence on macrophages were investigated in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived macrophages (PBMC-derived macrophages). RESULTS: Astragaloside IV significantly mitigated neurological impairment and reduced cerebral infarction volume in MCAO mice by inhibition of peripheral monocytes/macrophage inflammatory infiltration. In activated BMDMs and PBMC-derived macrophages, astragaloside IV interacted with Slc25a1, attenuated citrate transport, maintained mitochondrial function, therefore enhancing the shift from the M1- to M2-like macrophages. Mechanistically, astragaloside IV inhibited the transcriptional regulation of HIF-1α on GABA-T via citate-mediated histone H3 and H4 deacetylation and promoted the resumption of the broken TCA cycle and mitochondrial OXPHOS in macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: Our study unveiled a therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke by intervening in the inflammatory infiltration of peripheral monocytes/macrophages. Astragaloside IV, by binding to the mitochondrial citrate transporter Slc25a1, maintained the homeostasis of the TCA cycle and mitochondrial function, ultimately blocking the inflammation of peripheral macrophages to ameliorate ischemic stroke damage. This discovery provides data support for expanding the clinical application of astragaloside IV and offers research insights into the external treatment of encephalopathy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Haploinsufficient deletions of GABA transporter 1 (GAT-1)- encoding SLC6A1, and GABA transporter 3 (GAT-3)-encoding SLC6A11 are implicated in epileptic syndromes. Despite their significance, the impact of these deletions has not been characterized. Our previous work on SLC6A1 missense mutations prompted a clinical trial for Ravicti (NCT04937062), a glycerol formulation of 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA), for treatment-resistant epilepsy. We observed phenotypic overlap between trial-eligible SLC6A1 mutation patients and 3p- syndrome patients carrying deletions of SLC6A1 and SLC6A11. This study characterizes the functional impact of these deletions and assesses the urgent question of whether 3p- syndrome patients could benefit from this treatment. METHODS: Chromosomal microarray analysis identified a deletion affecting one allele of both SLC6A1 and SLC6A11 in two pediatric patients with 3p- syndrome. Clinical phenotyping included electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings and neurodevelopmental assessments. Functional characterization was conducted using 3H-labeled GABA uptake assays and Western blotting in HEK293T cells, comparing haploinsufficient and missense variant models. RESULTS: The haploinsufficient GAT-1 and GAT-3 conditions demonstrated reduced GABA uptake and protein expression, comparable to known SLC6A1 missense variants. Post-treatment EEGs showed a moderate reduction in epileptiform discharges following PBA administration, and patients exhibited improved motor function. However, varying degrees of cognitive impairments persisted. CONCLUSIONS: Haploinsufficiency of SLC6A1 and SLC6A11 contributes to the epileptic phenotypes observed in 3p- syndrome, marking this as the first study to biochemically characterize the functional impact of these deletions. Treatment with PBA may provide therapeutic benefits, particularly for addressing seizures and motor deficits, though further exploration of PBA's long-term effects in patients with 3p- syndrome is warranted.",

In this study, we investigated whether changes in GABAA receptor configuration at synaptic or extrasynaptic sites contribute to enhanced GABAergic activity in the resected samples of FCD patients. Results showed increase in the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents on treatment with gaboxadol (agonist for α4δ-containing GABAA receptors). In the presence of tetrodotoxin (voltage-gated Na+ channel inhibitor), frequency and amplitude of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents were also increased upon treatment with gaboxadol. However, higher magnitude of change was observed in spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents compared to miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents on gaboxadol treatment, suggesting action potential-dependent α4-containing GABAA receptor activity may influence epileptogenicity in FCD.",

In situ generating injectable hydrogels, characterized by minimally invasive methods, encapsulating stability, and pH-responsive breakdown have emerged as viable delivery systems. Herein, we aim to explore a particular therapeutic modality involving the use of celecoxib-loaded GABA/wheat gluten‑sodium alginate (SA/WG-GABA+COX(40)) nanocarriers in enhancing apoptosis of OSCC (HSC-3 & SCC-25). Eventually, drug release profiles show that loaded COX and GABA demonstrated 96.04% and 98.1% at 7.2 pH. Interestingly, crucial experimental techniques like MTT assay, AO/EB staining, DAPI labeling for SCC-25, and HSC-3 displayed the highest cell lysis percentages of 86.5% and 93.3%. Notably, OSCC cell proliferation and migration and cell multiplications were limited with formulated WG/SA-GABA+COX(40) which was evident from In vitro ROS assay, flow cytometry, and JC-1 analysis. In vivo histology, blood serum biochemistry, and tumor examination in xenograft nude mice demonstrated that SA/WG-GABA+COX(40) mice reduced HSC-3 tumor cell proliferation. Downregulation of glutathione and activation of CCND2 signaling pathway caused HSC-3 OSCC cell death. Henceforth, present findings offer an advanced drug delivery method for targeted chemotherapy in treating OSCC.",

METHODS: We recruited fourty-four adults living with HIV-1 aviremic under antiretroviral therapy. Their peripheral blood concentrations in glutamate and GABA were determined by ELISA. Flow cytometry was used to detect GABA receptor, reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by monocytes, and programmed T cell death. DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and p53 phosphorylation were analyzed by western blot. DNA damage was quantified by immunofluorescence. RESULTS: We show that i) some virologic responders present high plasma levels of glutamate and of its derivative, GABA; ii) monocytes express the GABA receptor GABA-B1; iii) GABA-B1 stimulation induces monocytic ROS production; iv) GABA-B1-overexpressing monocytes of PWH with high plasma levels of GABA release high amount of ROS; and v) monocyte-derived ROS oxidise the DNA of CD4+ T cells, creating double-strand breaks which activate DNA-PK and p53, and finally apoptosis. The intensity of this cascade of events is inversely correlated with the slope of CD4+ T cell recovery in treated PWH. DISCUSSION: We propose that DNA damage resulting from ROS produced by GABA-activated monocytes plays a key role in impaired immune restoration. Consequently, GABA-B1 antagonists and/or ROS inhibitors might be a promising therapy for non-immunologic responders. Furthermore, the same mechanism could be involved in CD4 loss in the natural course of the infection."

      "abstract": "The present study investigated the impact of GABAergic signaling and miRNA expression on glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) growth within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and its associated cognitive and emotional impairments. The implantation of C6 cells into the mPFC induced GBM in this brain region (referred to as the mPFC-GBM) in male Wistar rats via stereotaxic surgery, as confirmed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining. Repeated microinjections of muscimol, a potent GABAA receptor agonist, directly into the mPFC-GBM (1 µg/rat/2.5 μl) following tumor induction decreased tumor volume and weight, resulting in an increased survival rate. Conversely, a higher dose of muscimol (6 µg/rat/2.5 μl) increased tumor size and reduced survival. Behavioral alterations induced by GBM, including anxiety-like responses, exploratory behaviors, locomotor activity, and memory formation, were assessed using anxiety-like behavior task, the hole-board test, and the novel object recognition test. Muscimol treatment dose-dependently affected these behaviors in the animals with the mPFC-GBM, bringing their performance with that of the sham group at the dose of 1 µg/rat/2.5 μl. Changes in specific miRNAs expressions, including miR-208, -290-295, -345, -743 and -802 were associated with the growth of the mPFC-GBM under muscimol treatment. These findings suggest that GBM growth into the mPFC profoundly impacts cognitive and emotional behaviors which can be improved by muscimol treatment. Considering that the expression levels of targeted miRNAs could be influenced by the growth of the mPFC-GBM, both with or without muscimol treatment, these non-coding RNAs might serve as potential biomarkers for GBM.",

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a kind of non-protein amino acid that acts as an osmoprotectant. This study aimed to elucidate the effects of the gabT gene on the survival of C. sakazakii, GABA accumulation, and biofilm formation under desiccation, osmotic stress, and acid exposure. A gabT knockout strain of C. sakazakii was developed using gene recombination techniques. The GABA content and survival rates of both the wild-type and knockout strains were compared under various stress conditions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe cellular damage and biofilm formation. Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The deletion of gabT resulted in enhanced GABA accumulation under different stress conditions, improving the bacterium's tolerance to desiccation, osmotic pressure, and acid treatment. SEM images revealed that under identical stress conditions, the gabT knockout strain exhibited less cellular damage compared to the wild-type strain. Both strains were capable of biofilm formation under low osmotic pressure stress, but the gabT knockout strain showed higher GABA content, denser biofilm formation, and increased biofilm quantity. Similar trends were observed under acid stress conditions. The gabT gene plays a key role in modulating GABA accumulation, which enhances the stress tolerance and biofilm formation of C. sakazakii. These findings provide new insights into the role of GABA in bacterial survival mechanisms and highlight the potential for targeting GABA pathways to control C. sakazakii in food processing environments."

      "abstract": "α6-containing GABAA receptors (α6GABAARs) are strongly expressed in cerebellar granule cells and are of central importance for cerebellar functions. The cerebellum not only is involved in regulation of motor activity, but also in regulation of thought, cognition, emotion, language, and social behavior. Activation of α6GABAARs enhances the precision of sensory inputs, enables rapid and coordinated movement and adequate responses to the environment, and protects the brain from information overflow. The cerebellum has strong connections to multiple brain regions via closed loop circuits and is also extensively connected with the dopamine system in the prefrontal cortex, that initiates the execution of behavior. Patients suffering from schizophrenia exhibit an impaired structure and function of the cerebellum and an impaired GABAergic transmission at α6GABAARs. This also impairs the function of the dopamine system, can explain a variety of schizophrenia symptoms observed, and might be one of the pathophysiological causes of schizophrenia. Enhancing GABAergic transmission at α6GABAARs should thus reduce the symptoms of schizophrenia. This recently has been confirmed by demonstrating that positive allosteric modulators with high selectivity for α6GABAARs can reduce positive and negative symptoms and cognitive impairment of schizophrenia in several animal models of this disorder. So far, the beneficial actions of these modulators have been demonstrated in animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders, only. Future human studies have to investigate the safety and possible side effects of these modulators and to clarify, to which extent individual symptoms of schizophrenia can be reduced by these drugs in patients during acute and chronic dosing.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High temperature is a critical environmental factor leading to mass mortality in oyster aquaculture in China. Recent advancements highlight the physiological regulation function of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the adaptation of environmental stress. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study examined the physiological responses of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) upon high temperature exposure, focusing on the histopathological changes in gill, the GABA concentration, the mRNA expression and activities of apoptosis-related genes. Following 24 h of exposure to seawater at 28 °C, notable histopathological changes, including cellular swelling and vacuolization, along with an increase in TUNEL-positive cells were observed in the oyster gill, compared to the control group maintained at 18 °C. Moreover, there was a significant increase in CgCaspase-3 transcripts, Caspase-3 and Caspase-9 activities in the gills, glutamate decarboxylase CgGAD transcripts in the haemocytes, and GABA concentrations in the haemolymph supernatant. Intervention with GABA markedly ameliorated these responses, including reducing the mRNA expression levels of CgBax, CgBak, CgCaspase-3, and CgCaspase-9, as well as the activities of Caspase-3/9. Furthermore, after the treatment with GABAA and GABAB receptor antagonists, the activities and expression levels of Caspase-3 and Caspase-9 significantly up-regulated under hightemperature stress. GABA treatment also significantly diminished the increased Caspase-3 activity by mitochondrial pathway apoptosis inducers. CONCLUSIONS: High temperature induced mitochondrial pathway apoptosis via increased caspase activities. The transcripts of CgGAD in haemocytes and GABA concentration in hemolymph supernatant also increased after high-temperature stress. GABA countered these effects through the activation of GABAA and GABAB receptors, reducing both caspase activity and expression of apoptosis-related genes.",

      "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that leads to the progressive destruction of insulin-producing β cells, resulting in lifelong insulin dependence and a range of severe complications. Beyond conventional glycemic control, innovative therapeutic strategies are needed to address the underlying disease mechanisms. Recent research has highlighted gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a promising therapeutic target for T1D due to its dual role in modulating both β cell survival and immune response within pancreatic islets. GABA signaling supports β cell regeneration, inhibits α cell hyperactivity, and promotes α-to-β cell transdifferentiation, contributing to improved islet function. Moreover, GABA's influence extends to mitigating T1D complications, including nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy, as well as regulating central nervous system pathways involved in glucose metabolism. This review consolidates the latest advances in GABA-related T1D therapies, covering animal preclinical and human clinical studies and examining the therapeutic potential of GABA receptor modulation, combination therapies, and dietary interventions. Emphasis is placed on the translational potential of GABA-based approaches to enhance β cell viability and counteract autoimmune processes in T1D. Our findings underscore the therapeutic promise of GABA signaling modulation as a novel approach for T1D treatment and encourage further investigation into this pathway's role in comprehensive diabetes management.",

GABA has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PCOS through its central role in the hypothalamus. Hence, in this study we investigated the effect of Nipecotic acid (NPA) in Letrozole induced PCOS in female Wistar rats as NPA has been proven as a GABA uptake inhibitor. In this study 30 female Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups each group containing 6 animals and treated as follows-Healthy control: Vehicle, 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC); Diseased control: Letrozole 1 mg/kg orally in 0.5% CMC; Test group-1: Letrozole + NPA (2.5 mg/kg i.p.); Test group-2: Letrozole + NPA (5 mg/kg i.p.) and Standard group: Letrozole + Clomiphene citrate (1 mg/kg in 0.5% CMC orally). Body weight, feed intake, water intake and vaginal smear was recorded on daily basis till the completion of the treatment tenure, whereas serum oestrogen, testosterone and GABA; ovary and uterus histopathology; lipid profile; OGTT; GsH, MDA and TNF-alpha in ovary tissue were estimated in the end of the treatment tenure. NPA treated groups demonstrated an improvement in the irregularities of the oestrous cycle with respect to PCOS control group. Further, NPA at both doses significantly (p < 0.001) reduced oxidative stress and inflammation in the ovary. It significantly (p < 0.001) reduced the serum testosterone and significantly (p < 0.001) elevated the serum oestrogen level. Histopathological reports depicted NPA reduced follicular cysts and promoted ovulation. These results emphasize the possibility of NPA as a treatment option for PCOS related reproductive and metabolic disorders, addressing the unmet need for effective PCOS management.",

      "abstract": "Dysregulation of GABAergic inhibition is associated with pathological pain. Consequently, enhancement of GABAergic transmission represents a potential analgesic strategy. However, therapeutic potential of current GABA agonists and modulators is limited by unwanted side effects. We postulated that inhibition of GABA's degradation enzyme, GABA aminotransferase (GABA-AT), would increase endogenous GABA levels and produce analgesia. We evaluated antinociceptive efficacy of the potent GABA-AT inhibitor OV329 in rodent models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain and assessed possible side effects (i.e., reward and motor impairment). OV329 attenuated the development and maintenance of mechanical and cold hypersensitivities induced by the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel. Prophylactic OV329, administered systemically, normalized paclitaxel-induced increases in glutamate levels and suppressed neuropathic nociception. Intrathecal OV329 suppressed paclitaxel-induced mechanical hypersensitivity, elevating GABA, and reducing glutamate levels in the lumbar spinal cord, consistent with a spinal site of action. Furthermore, OV329 largely synergized with paclitaxel to enhance 4T1 tumor cell line cytotoxicity without altering viability of nontumor cells. OV329 also attenuated inflammation-induced mechanical hypersensitivity induced by intraplanar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) with efficacy comparable to morphine. Unlike morphine, OV329 did not produce reward in a conditioned place preference assay in mice and was not self-administered intravenously by rats. Antinociceptive efficacy of OV329 was observed at doses that did not impair motor function or produce tolerance following chronic dosing. Thus, inhibition of GABA-AT with OV329 represents a unique therapeutic strategy to alleviate neuropathic and inflammatory pain with no apparent abuse liability, potentially producing a beneficial spectrum of pharmacological effects through enzymatic regulation.",

However, under excitotoxic/ischemic conditions, GABAB receptors are downregulated by dysregulated endocytic trafficking and can no longer counteract the severely enhanced excitation, eventually triggering neuronal death. Recently, we developed interfering peptides targeting protein-protein interactions involved in downregulating the receptors. Treatment with these peptides restored GABAB receptor expression after an ischemic insult and thereby inhibited neuronal overexcitation and progressive neuronal death. In this study, we searched for GABAB receptor interactions that specifically occur under ischemic conditions. We found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH1 is specifically upregulated under ischemic/excitotoxic conditions. Upregulated MARCH1 interacts with GABAB receptors and triggered downregulation of plasma membrane GABAB receptors by inhibiting fast recycling of the receptors. We developed an interfering peptide that inhibits the MARCH1/GABAB receptor interaction. Treatment of cultured neurons subjected to ischemic stress with this peptide restored receptor expression and as a consequence stopped progressive neuronal death. Thus, inhibiting the interaction of GABAB receptors with MARCH1 to restore cell surface receptor expression might be a promising strategy to prevent progressive neuronal death induced by ischemic conditions.",

METHODS: We examined the analgesic effects of NDSM using both pain-evoked and pain-suppressed behavioral assays in two persistent pain models. Then western blot assay and immunofluorescence staining were used to investigate the effects of NDSM on the expression of the GABAA receptor α2 subunit (GABRA2) and inflammatory factors in the spinal cord and brain tissues of male spared nerve injury (SNI) mice. Finally, the individual subtypes of GABAARs (α1, α2, α3, and α5) were respectively silenced by viral-mediated knockdown to explore the involvement of subtypes of GABAARs in the effects of NDSM on the pain-like behaviors in male SNI mice. RESULTS: NDSM demonstrated significant analgesic effects against chronic pain both in pain-evoked and pain-suppressed behavioral assays. NDSM treatment significantly reversed the SNI induced down-regulation of GABRA2 and up-regulation of TNF-α and IL-1β. The analgesic effects of NDSM were completely blocked by silencing GABRA2 or partially blocked by silencing GABRA3. CONCLUSION: This study provided the first evidence that the analgesic effects of NDSM are mediated primarily by GABRA2 and partially by GABRA3, and the inhibition of neuroinflammation also contributes to the analgesic effects of NDSM.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been reported to modulate gamma-aminobutyric acid levels and cerebral energy consumption in the brain. This study aims to investigate long-term GABA and cerebral energy modulation following anodal tDCS over the primary motor cortex. METHOD: To assess GABA and energy level changes, proton and phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy data were acquired before and after anodal or sham tDCS. In anodal stimulation, a 1 mA current was applied for 20 min, and the duration of ramping the current up/down at the start and end of the intervention was 10 s. In the sham-stimulation condition, the current was first ramped up over a period of 10 s, then immediately ramped down, and the condition was maintained for the next 20 min. RESULTS: The GABA concentration increased significantly following anodal stimulation in the first and second post-stimulation measurements. Likewise, both ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi ratios increased after anodal stimulation in the first and second post-stimulation measurements. CONCLUSION: The approach employed in this study shows the feasibility of measuring long-term modulation of GABA and high-energy phosphates following anodal tDCS targeting the left M1, offering valuable insights into the mechanisms of neuroplasticity and energy metabolism, which may have implications for applications of this intervention in clinical populations."

      "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm is a potentially fatal vascular inflammatory disease characterized by infiltration of various inflammatory cells.The GABA-A receptor is expressed in many inflammatory cells such as macrophages and T cells and has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Therefore, the GABA-A receptor may become a potential therapeutic target for abdominal aortic aneurysms. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of regulating the activity of the GABA-A receptor on the formation of experimental abdominal aortic aneurysm in rats. In this study, the abdominal aortic aneurysm model of rats was established by aorta intracavitary perfusion of elastase combined with aorta extracavitary infiltration of calcium chloride. GABA-A receptor agonist (topiramate) and antagonist (bicuculline) were used to treating the abdominal aortic aneurysm model rats, which were divided into sham operation group, model group, topiramate group, and bicuculline group(n = 10). Histopathology, immunohistochemistry, fluorescence quantitative PCR, Western blotting, ELISA and Gelatine zymogram were used to study. Regulation of GABA-A receptor activity can interfere with the development and severity of abdominal aortic aneurysms in rats. The GABA-A receptor agonist topiramate reduces the infiltration of inflammatory cells, particularly T cells, into the abdominal aortic wall, while also modulating the balance of Th1/Th2 cytokines in peripheral blood, leading to a significant reduction in inflammatory responses. Additionally, topiramate decreases the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases MMP2 and MMP9, thereby inhibiting extracellular matrix degradation and slowing the progression of aneurysms. In contrast, the GABA-A receptor antagonist bicuculline exacerbates inflammation and promotes aneurysm development. At the molecular level, the mechanisms of action of the GABA-A receptor agonist topiramate and the antagonist bicuculline may involve inhibition or activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Regulation of GABA-A receptor activity can effectively intervene in the occurrence and development of abdominal aortic aneurysms in rats.",

Recent studies implicate reduced somatostatin (SST) interneuron inhibition in depression, and new pharmacology boosting this inhibition via positive allosteric modulators of α5-GABAA receptors (α5-PAM) offers a promising effective treatment. However, testing the effect of α5-PAM on human brain activity is limited, meriting the use of detailed simulations. We utilized our previous detailed computational models of human depression microcircuits with reduced SST interneuron inhibition and α5-PAM effects, to simulate EEG of individual microcircuits across depression severity and α5-PAM doses. We developed machine learning models that predicted optimal dose from EEG with high accuracy and recovered microcircuit activity and EEG. This study provides dose prediction models for α5-PAM administration based on EEG biomarkers of depression severity. Given limitations in doing the above in the living human brain, the results and tools we developed will facilitate translation of α5-PAM treatment to clinical use.",

The Ts65Dn mouse model of DS shows cognitive impairment due to a reduction in neuron number and connectivity as well as excessive neuronal activity, as GABA antagonist treatment restores memory in these mice. Our study showed the effects of GABA antagonist treatment on sleep and decision-making in Ts65Dn mice. We administered a daily, low oral dose of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) in milk to Ts65Dn mice for 17 days. Decision-making was tested with and without PTZ treatment. Short and long-term memories were tested before, immediately after, and one month following PTZ treatment. Electro-encephalography (EEG) was also recorded at these three time points to study the effect of the treatment on sleep. We showed that PTZ treatment improved long-term recognition, but not short-term, memory and led to more Ts65Dn mice showing safer decision-making behavior. PTZ treatment showed a moderate and only global beneficial effect on sleep by decreasing the global amount of wake and increasing NREM sleep in the Ts65Dn mice, which may explain the observed cognitive improvements. These results bring new knowledge on the role of GABA in sleep, memory consolidation, and decision-making abilities in DS."

      "abstract": "AIMS: Chronic pain is a critical public health issue that severely impacts quality of life and poses significant treatment challenges, particularly due to the risk of adverse effects associated with pharmacological therapies. The search for effective non-invasive treatment alternatives has become increasingly relevant. Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) has been identified as an effective non-invasive strategy for pain management, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the analgesic effects and cellular mechanisms of LIFU-induced neuromodulation targeted on dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in both inflammatory and neuropathic pain models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study adopted in vivo complete Freund's adjuvant-induced inflammatory pain and chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain rat models, along with ex vivo DRG primary cultures. KEY FINDINGS: The application of LIFU resulted in a time-dependent analgesic response in both pain models. The neurophysiological analyses revealed that LIFU activated GABAergic neurons and deactivated CGRP-expressing neurons triggered by noxious stimuli. The analgesic effects of LIFU and the LIFU-deactivated CGRP-containing neurons were reversed by injecting GABA antagonist to the L5 DRG, confirming the mediation of these effects through the GABAergic pathways. Ex vivo LIFU stimulation of DRG resulted in increased GABA release and decreased capsaicin-triggered CGRP cascades, further supporting in vivo findings. SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate, for the first time, that LIFU modulates the GABA-CGRP pathways in the peripheral sensory neurons to alleviate pain, which underscores the importance of GABAergic systems in LIFU-induced analgesia. Our results reveal potential clinical applications of FUS for pain management through the peripheral nervous system.",

      "abstract": "GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) is a non-protein amino acid that occurs naturally in the human brain, animals, plants and microorganisms. It is primarily produced by the irreversible action of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) on the α-decarboxylation of L-glutamic acid. As a major neurotransmitter in the brain, GABA plays a crucial role in behavior, cognition, and the body's stress response. GABA is mainly synthesized through the GABA shunt and the polyamine degradation pathways. It works through three receptors (GABAA, GABAB, and GABAC), each exhibiting different pharmacological and physiological characteristics. GABA has a variety of physiological roles and applications. In plants, it regulates growth, development and stress responses. In mammals, it influences physiological functions such as nervous system regulation, blood pressure equilibrium, liver and kidneys enhancement, hormone secretion regulation, immunity enhancement, cancer prevention, as well as anti-aging effects. As a biologically active ingredient, GABA possesses unique physiological effects and medicinal value, leading to its widespread application and substantially increased market demand in the food and pharmaceutical industries. GABA is primarily produced through chemical synthesis, plant enrichment and microbial fermentation. In this review, we first make an overview of GABA, focusing on its synthesis, metabolism, GABA receptors and physiological functions. Next, we describe the industrial production methods of GABA. Finally, we discuss the development of ligands for the GABA receptor binding site, the prospects of GABA production and application, as well as its clinical trials in potential drugs or compounds targeting GABA for the treatment of epilepsy. The purpose of this review is to attract researchers from various fields to focus on GABA research, promote multidisciplinary communications and collaborations, break down disciplinary barriers, stimulate innovative research ideas and methods, and advance the development and application of GABA in medicine, agriculture, food and other fields.",

SST cells inhibit pyramidal cell dendrites through α5-GABA-A receptors (α5-GABAA-R). α5-GABAAR positive allosteric modulation (α5-PAM) has procognitive and neurotrophic effects in stress and aging models. We tested whether α5-PAM (GL-II-73) could prevent cognitive deficits and neuronal spine loss in early stages, and reverse them in late stages of β-amyloid deposition in the 5xFAD model (N = 48/study; 50 % female). Acute administration of GL-II-73 prevented spatial working memory deficits in 5xFAD mice at 2 months of age, while chronic administration reversed the deficits at 5 months of age. Chronic GL-II-73 treatment prevented 5xFAD-induced loss of spine density, spine count and dendritic length at both time points, despite β-amyloid accumulation. These results demonstrate procognitive and neurotrophic effects of GL-II-73 in early and late stages of Alzheimer-related β-amyloid deposition. This suggests α5-PAM as a novel β-amyloid-independent symptomatic therapeutic approach.",

However, only in recent years have experimental protein structures been published that can open the door to understanding protein-ligand interactions and may effectively help the rational drug design for the future. In our previous work (Szabó, G. J. Med. Chem. 2022, 65(11), 7876), where a promising selective α5-GABAA negative allosteric modulator (NAM) was developed containing the 3-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-methyl-1,2-oxazole headgroup, we noticed a switch-like effect of a single nitrogen atom for the receptor function in some derivatives having a dihydro-naphthyridinone or dihydro-isoquinolinone moiety. Here, we focused on this chemotype, and a small set of compounds were designed to investigate ligand-receptor interactions experimentally and through computational methods. Elaborated compounds were tested against GABAA α1 and α5 subunit-containing receptors, and binding affinities and functional activities were measured. Starting from the published experimental structure of an engineered, homopentameric, basmisanil-binding GABAA receptor-like construct consisting of modified α5 subunits and an α1-containing GABAA structure, we created a new model of the ligand binding site at the α5/γ2 interface. Using this model, the measured ligand affinities were able to be reproduced well by free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations. In addition, calculations were able to explain the obtained structure-activity relationships, among others, the switch-like effect of the aromatic nitrogen position in the dihydro-naphthyridinone motif for the functional character, and suggest different binding poses for the ligands presenting silent versus negative allosteric effects in this set (SAMs vs. NAMs, respectively). We believe that our results can help design α5 selective GABAA negative allosteric modulators and better understand the GABAA receptor.",

The screening results showed that foxtail millet seeds soaked with 60 mg/L of Na2SeO3 solution and sprayed with 2 mg/L of Na2SeO3 solution were the appropriate concentrations for the germination process. Compared with the spraying method, a presoaking treatment presented far higher selenium content and significantly higher (p < 0.05) selenium enrichment rates in foxtail millet sprouts. The content of free and bound phenolics, as well as GABA, were significantly (p < 0.05) increased in foxtail millet sprouts through both soaking and spraying treatments. Correspondingly, most of the individual phenolic compounds were significantly (p < 0.05) increased, especially after germination for 3 days. Trans-ferulic acid and trans-p-coumaric acid were the predominate bound phenolic acids, feruloylquinic acid and 4-p-coumaroylquinic acid were the major free-form phenolic compounds, and N-feruloyl serotonin and N-(p-coumaroyl) serotonin were the new arising phenolic derivatives caused by germination. Both the soaking and spraying treatments induced the enrichment of these individual phenolic compositions, thus increasing the total phenolic content and in vitro antioxidant activity of foxtail millet sprouts. It was indicated that selenium-enriched germination treatment should be an effective method to produce functional selenium-enriched foxtail millet sprouts with more abundant GABA and polyphenols, thus enhancing the health benefits and added value of foxtail millet."

Most of the therapeutic drugs for insomnia currently used in clinical practice are not developed in a targeted manner, but are discovered by chance, and have unavoidable side effects such as addiction. Finding a safer and more effective therapeutic drug has become an urgent need for current research. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. It can ameliorate Insomnia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Epilepsy, and other neurological disorders. Various mechanisms have been reported for GABA to ameliorate insomnia, such as GABAA receptor modulation, GABAB receptor modulation, inhibition of neuroinflammatory responses, repair of oxidative damage, and inter-regulation of the circadian rhythm hormone melatonin. GABA is a potential therapeutic target in the prevention and treatment of insomnia. This paper reviews mechanisms of GABA and its receptors in insomnia diseases and the potential of GABA analogs application and discusses the research progress of GABA as a promising therapeutic drug for insomnia diseases. This will help the development of novel targeted GABA-like drugs and provide new ideas and methods for the clinical treatment of insomnia."

      "abstract": "Impaired spinal GABAergic inhibitory neuronal system is one popular target for developing new drugs or procedures for treatment of neuropathic pain, but effective and transferable methods are still lacking. We designed an assembled, temperature sensitive and sustained releasing hydrogel to repair the impaired GABAergic neural system by reversing imbalance of glutamic acid (Glu) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and healing impaired Cl- extrusion capacity of neurons. Hydrogel solution is a mixture of pluronic F-127, recombinant glutamate decarboxylase 67 (rGAD67) protein and CLP257, a K+-Cl- cotransporter isoform 2 (KCC2) enhancer. The temperature sensitive properties, gel properties and slow-releasing properties of the drug system were determined in vitro. After intrathecal injected in sural spared nerve injury mice model, the hydrogel solution turned into gel, capturing Glu and transforming it into GABA. CLP257 released from gel reversed the suppressed expression of KCC2 in spinal cord, maintaining a low intracellular Cl- concentration in neurons and allowing the normal work of GABA receptors. Combination of rGAD67 and CLP257 showed synergistic effects in alleviating hyperalgesia, altering glia activation, and inhibiting cell apoptosis and inflammatory response. In conclusion, the in situ assembled gel is a long-term effective tool for repairing damaged GABAergic inhibitory system and alleviating neuropathic pain.",

The GABAB agonist baclofen has been reported to reduce alcohol consumption but is associated with some undesirable side effects, including sedation. ASP8062 is a novel compound that acts as a positive allosteric modulator at the GABAB receptor and may be more tolerable than baclofen. This proof-of-concept human laboratory clinical trial evaluated the safety profile of ASP8062 and tested its effects on cue-elicited alcohol craving and alcohol use among treatment-seeking individuals with AUD. METHODS: This double-blind, randomized, multisite trial tested the effect of ASP8062 (25 mg once daily), relative to placebo, on alcohol cue-elicited craving in a laboratory setting and alcohol consumption, craving, mood, sleep, cigarette smoking, and alcohol-related consequences in the natural environment over a 6-week treatment period. Participants were 60 individuals (26 females and 34 males) with moderate or severe AUD. RESULTS: ASP8062, relative to placebo, was well tolerated, and there were no adverse events (AEs) that significantly differed between treatment groups. Most AEs were mild/moderate, and there were no serious AEs among individuals treated with ASP8062. However, ASP8062 did not attenuate alcohol cue-elicited craving compared with placebo. Moreover, exploratory analyses indicated that ASP8062, relative to placebo, did not significantly affect alcohol consumption, naturalistic alcohol craving, mood, sleep, cigarette smoking, or alcohol-related negative consequences during the 6-week treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: Although ASP8062 was well tolerated with no serious AEs, the novel compound did not significantly dampen alcohol cue-elicited craving or improve other AUD-related outcome measures. These data indicate positive allosteric modulation of the GABAB receptor at the dose evaluated here may not blunt alcohol cue-elicited craving, and preliminary drinking outcome data suggest it may not be an efficacious treatment strategy for AUD."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease characterized by a progressive β-cell destruction. There are no clinically established methods for quantifying endocrine cells of the pancreas and current knowledge is almost exclusively based on autopsy material and functional measurements. Based on the expression of the γ-aminobutyric acid A receptors (GABAARs) in pancreatic islets and the fact that GABAAR agonists are being explored as treatment for T1D, we hypothesized that the positron emission tomography (PET) tracer [11C]flumazenil ([11C]FMZ) could serve as a marker of the endocrine mass of the pancreas. The in vivo uptake of [11C]FMZ in pig pancreas was evaluated by PET/CT, either tracer alone or after blockade of GABAAR by unlabeled flumazenil. The pancreatic binding of [11C]FMZ was investigated in vitro with frozen sections of pig pancreas as well as human organ donors, in addition to isolated mouse and human islets and exocrine preparations. The expression of GABAAR subunits in pig, human and mouse pancreas was explored by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Strong specific in vivo uptake of [11C]FMZ was observed in the pig brain as expected, but in the pancreas the signal was moderate and only partially reduced by blockade. In vitro experiments revealed a positive but weak and variable binding of [11C]FMZ in islets compared to exocrine tissue in the mouse, pig and human pancreas. In pig and mouse pancreatic islets we identified the GABAAR subunits β2 and γ2 but not α2. In the human pancreas from non-diabetic donors, we have identified the α2, β2 (although weak) and γ2 subunits, whereas from a T2D donor the α2 subunit was missing. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that [11C]FMZ bind to GABAARs in the islets, but not with a sufficient contrast or magnitude to be implemented as an in vivo PET marker for the endocrine mass of the pancreas. However, GABAARs with different subunits are widely expressed in the endocrine cells within the pancreas in pig, human and mouse. Hence, the GABAAR could still be a potential imaging target for the endocrine cells of the pancreas but would require tracers with higher affinity and selectivity for individual GABAAR subunits."

      "abstract": "Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) is synthesized from glutamate by glutamic decarboxylase (GAD). The entero-pancreatic biology of GABA, which is produced by pancreatic islets, GAD-expressing microbiota, enteric immune cells, or ingested through diet, supports an essential physiologic role of GABA in the health and disease. Outside the central nervous system (CNS), GABA is uniquely concentrated in pancreatic β-cells. They express GAD65, which is a type 1 diabetes (T1D) autoantigen. Glutamate constitutes 10% of the amino acids in dietary protein and is preeminently concentrated in human milk. GABA is enriched in many foods, such as tomato and fermented cheese, and is an over-the-counter supplement. Selected microbiota in the midgut have the enzymatic capacity to produce GABA. Intestinal microbiota interact with gut-associated lymphoid tissue to maintain host defenses and immune tolerance, which are implicated in autoimmune disease. Although GABA is a widely known inhibitory neurotransmitter, oral GABA does not cross the blood brain barrier. Three diabetes-related therapeutic actions are ascribed to GABA, namely, increasing pancreatic β-cell content, attenuating excess glucagon and tamping down T-cell immune destruction. These salutary actions have been observed in numerous rodent diabetes models that usually employed high or near-continuous GABA doses. Clinical studies, to date, have identified positive effects of oral GABA on peripheral blood mononuclear cell cytokine release and plasma glucagon. Going forward, it is reassuring that oral GABA therapy has been well-tolerated and devoid of serious adverse effects.",

In the striatum, glutamatergic afferents initiate the activity of GABAergic medium spiny neurons. This study addressed whether traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects GABA and glutamate extracellular levels in the dorsal striatum as an indicator of effects on the cortico-striatal pathway, in rats with motor deficits and recovered animals. Animals were assigned to a sham group, a TBI-alone group, and a TBI + striatal injury group (local injection of a FeCl2 solution to mimic hemorrhagic lesion). In the TBI-alone and TBI + striatal injury groups, motor deficits were accompanied by decreased extracellular GABA and glutamate levels in the striatum at 3 days post-injury. The TBI + striatal injury group showed higher motor deficits, which lasted 7 days longer, and GABA levels were significantly different compared to the TBI alone group. At 18 days post-injury, in recovered rats from the TBI-alone group GABA and glutamate levels returned to control levels. Alterations in extracellular GABA and glutamate levels indicate damage to the cortico-striatal pathway, underscoring the importance of studying this pathway for treatment and recovery after TBI.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbance causes many health problems in humans worldwide. This study evaluated the effects and possible mechanisms of sclareol (SCL) and/or linalool (LIN) through in vivo and in silico studies. For this, young chicks SCL (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) and/or LIN (50 mg/kg) were orally administered thirty minutes before to the thiopental sodium (TS)-induced chicks with or without the standard drug diazepam (DZP: 3 mg/kg). Incidence, onset, and duration of sleep were then noted. The results suggest that SCL dose-dependently increased the onset and decreased the duration of sleep in animals. In contrast, LIN50 significantly (p < 0.05) decreased onset and increased sleep duration. SCL20 combined with LIN50 and/or DZP3 modulated the sleep parameters in animals. In combination, LIN50 showed better effects with DZP3, where the percentage decrease in latency and increase in sleep duration were 54.20 and 168.65 %, respectively. SCL20 when combined with LIN50 + DZP3 also modulated the onset and duration of sleep in animals. Further, in silico studies suggest that SCL and LIN have binding affinities with the 6X3X protein of the GABAA receptor (α1 and β2 subunits) of -6.9 and -6.8 kcal/mol, respectively. The standard drug DZP showed a binding affinity of -5.0 kcal/mol. Taken together, SCL may exert an angiogenic-like effect and antagonize LIN and/or DZP-mediated sedative effects in TS-induced chicks, possibly through the GABAA receptor α1 and β2 subunits interaction pathway.",

Despite regulatory restrictions, their pervasive nature necessitates further research into their potential effects on cellular and neuronal function. This study first evaluated the cytotoxic effects of PFOS and PFOA on S1 neuroblastoma cells; a dose-dependent reduction in cell viability was revealed for PFOS, while PFOA exhibited minimal toxicity until millimolar concentrations. We further investigated their potential to modulate GABAergic neurotransmission using patch-clamp electrophysiology. Both PFOS and PFOA caused a significant but reversible reduction in GABA receptor-mediated currents following one-minute pre-treatment. These findings suggest that PFOS and PFOA can interfere with both cellular viability and GABAergic signaling, providing critical insights into their functional impacts and highlighting the need for further investigation into the long-term consequences of PFAS exposure on nervous system health."

Novel research implies that glutamatergic and GABAergic abnormalities may be present in treatment-resistant patients, and preclinical research suggests that clozapine affects the GABAergic system. Moreover, clozapine may have a neuroprotective role. To investigate these issues, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate the relationship between clozapine and in vivo measures of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate (glu), and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) brain levels in treatment- and ultra-treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients (TRS and UTRS). Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we included three longitudinal and six cross sectional studies utilizing proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS) that explored brain metabolite levels in clozapine-treated patients. Findings were limited by a small number of studies and definite conclusions cannot be drawn, but the present studies may imply that clozapine reduces glutamate levels in striatal but not cortical areas, whereas glutamatergic metabolites and GABA levels may be increased in ACC in the combined group of TRS and UTRS. Clozapine may also increase NAA in cortical areas. Importantly, this review highlights the need for further clinical studies investigating the effect of clozapine on brain levels of glutamate, GABA, and NAA as well as metabolite group differences in patients with UTRS compared with TRS.",

Therefore, the objective of this research was to explore the potential regulatory mechanisms of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) accumulation in fresh-cut stem lettuce following GABA treatment. The evidence showed that exogenous GABA stimulated the GABA shunt by elevating glutamate levels, the activities of GABA transaminase (GABA-T) and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD). Similarly, GABA stimulated polyamine metabolism by increasing the activities of 4-amino aldehyde dehydrogenase (AMADH), polyamine oxidase (PAO) and diamine oxidase (DAO), as well as elevating free polyamines, arginine and ornithine levels. Subsequently, GABA application up-regulated the expression of GABA shunt genes and polyamine metabolism genes. Additionally, GABA treatment resulted in the down-regulation of LsMYB44 and LsWRKY12 expressions. Notably, LsMYB44 bound to MYB binding sites in the LsGAD, LsGABAT1, LsADC1, LsPAO2, LsALDH7B4 promoters and repressed transcription of these genes. The interaction between LsMYB44 and LsWRKY12 was associated with the transcriptional repression of polyamine metabolism and GABA shunt genes by LsMYB44. In conclusion, LsMYB44 and LsWRKY12 downregulated the transcription of key genes of GABA shunt and polyamine metabolism in fresh-cut lettuce. This downregulation, however, was alleviated by the application of GABA, thereby promoting endogenous GABA accumulation.",

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a neurotransmitter naturally produced from glutamate by the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase. Age-related decline in GABA is linked to age-related motor and sensory decline and seems to affect sarcopenia, yet no detailed study has been conducted. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of GABA on improving sarcopenia by suppressing muscle protein degradation through supplementing decreased GABA in old mice. METHODS: GABA (10 or 30 mg/kg/day) was orally administered daily to young (3 months) and old (21-23 months) C57BL/6 mice for 7 weeks. The body weight and grip strength of the mice were measured weekly at the same time. After sacrificing the mice, the quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles were excised from their hind limbs, and the spleen and serum were collected. Histological, biochemical and molecular analyses were conducted in various experiments. RESULTS: The administration of GABA increased muscle strength (+41%, +70% compared to the aged mouse control group, GABA at doses of 10 or 30 mg/kg/day respectively, p < 0.05) and muscle mass (quadriceps: +28%, +46%; gastrocnemius: +12%, +19%, p < 0.05) in old mice. This increase was accompanied by a cross-sectional area (CSA) increase in the quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscle (p < 0.05). The administration of GABA increased IGF-1 levels in serum (p < 0.05), leading to the activation of muscle protein synthesis. We found that GABA inhibits sarcopenia by regulating muscle protein degradation through the activation of Akt/mTOR/FoxO3a signalling pathways. GABA also regulates inflammaging, which is a hallmark of age-related muscle atrophy. There was a significant increase in the F4/80 + CD11b + total macrophage ratio in gastrocnemius and spleen, especially the M1 macrophage ratio increased in old mice. However, GABA administration was effective in suppressing M1 macrophages (gastrocnemius: -40%, - 53%; spleen: -22%, -26%, p < 0.05). Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6, primarily secreted by M1 macrophages, are also decreased by treatment with GABA (TNF-α: -24%, -27%; IL-6: -45%, -59%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Together, this study demonstrates the importance of GABA in maintaining muscle and low-chronic inflammation during ageing. We suggest that GABA shows potential as a substance that can effectively address sarcopenia and enhance the overall lifespan and well-being of older individuals.",

      "abstract": "Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is known for its heterogeneous nature and aggressive onset, limited unresponsiveness to hormone therapies and immunotherapy as well as high likelihood of metastasis and recurrence. Since no targeted standard treatment options are available for TNBC, novel and effective therapeutic targets are urgently needed. Ion channels have emerged as possible novel therapeutic candidates for cancer therapy. We previously showed that GABAA β3 subunit are expressed at higher levels in TNBC cell lines than non-tumorigenic MCF10A cells. GABAA β3 subunit knockdown causes cell cycle arrest in TNBC cell lines via decreased cyclin D1 and increased p21 expression. However, it is not known if the upregulated GABAAR express at the cell-surface in TNBC and mediate Cl- flux. Cl- ions are known to play a role in cell-cycle progression in other cancers such as gastric cancer. Here, using surface biotinylation and (N-(Ethoxycarbonylmethyl)-6-Methoxyquinolinium Bromide) MQAE-dye based fluorescence quenching, we show that upregulated GABAAR are on the cell-surface in TNBC cell lines and mediate significantly higher chloride (Cl-) flux as compared to non-tumorigenic MCF10A cells. Moreover, this GABAAR mediated Cl- flux can be modulated by pharmacological agents and is decreased in TNBC cells with GABAA β3 subunit knockdown. Further, treatment of TNBC cells with bicuculline, a GABAAR antagonist reduced cell viability in TNBC cells Overall, these results point to an unexplored role of GABAAR mediated Cl- flux in TNBC."

      "abstract": "γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission alterations have been implicated to play a role in depression pathogenesis. While GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulators are emerging as promising in clinical practice, their precise antidepressant mechanism remains to be further elucidated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of LY-02, a novel compound derived from the metabolite of timosaponin, on depression in animals and its mechanism. The results of behavioral tests showed that LY-02 exhibited better antidepressant effects in both male C57BL/6 mice and Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. The results of cellular voltage clamp experiments showed that LY-02 enhanced GABA-mediated currents in HEK293T cells expressing recombinant α6β3δ subunit-containing GABAA receptors. Electrophysiological recording from brain slices showed that LY-02 decreased the amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC) and increased action potentials of pyramidal neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of C57BL/6 mice. Western blot results showed that LY-02 dose-dependently up-regulated the protein expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tropomyosin related kinase B (TrkB) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) in mPFC of mice. The above results suggest that LY-02, as a positive modulator of GABAA receptors, reduces inhibitory neurotransmission in pyramidal neurons. It further activates the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway, thus exerting antidepressant effects. It suggests that LY-02 is a potential novel therapeutic agent for depression treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Developing anti-obesity interventions targeting appetite or food intake, the primary driver of obesity, remains challenging. Here, we demonstrated that dietary γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) with GABA-degradation inhibitory drugs could be an anti-obesity intervention possessing strong food intake-suppressive and weight-loss effects. METHODS: High-fat (HF)-diet-induced obese mice were divided into six groups receiving either the HF diet or the 2% GABA-HF diet with daily administration of PBS or the GABA-degradation inhibitory drugs, vigabatrin and ethanolamine-O-sulfate (EOS). In 24-h fast-induced refeeding, lean mice with a basal diet were used, and food intake was measured from 0.5 to 24 h after refeeding. RESULTS: Coadministration of the 2% GABA-HF diet with vigabatrin or EOS significantly decreased food intake (-53%, -35%) and body weight (-22%, -16%) within 11 days in obese mice, along with a marked increase in plasma GABA levels. Mice receiving dietary GABA alone or the drugs alone exhibited no such effects. Hypothalamic GABA levels increased in drug-treated mice, regardless of diet. At 0.5 h after refeeding, food intake was similar in all groups. However, at 0.5 h, plasma GABA levels were markedly increased only in mice receiving coadministration of dietary GABA and the drugs, and their food intake was completely inhibited for over 6 h, while mice in other groups gradually increased their food intake. CONCLUSION: Combining dietary GABA with GABA-degradation inhibitory drugs effectively suppresses food intake and promotes weight loss in obese mice, primarily through increased plasma GABA availability. These findings may advance the development of food intake-controlling strategies for obesity management."

      "abstract": "Wheat leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina, poses a growing threat to global wheat production, necessitating alternative strategies for effective disease management. This study investigated the potential of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to enhance resistance to leaf rust in two wheat cultivars: the susceptible Morocco and moderately resistant Sakha 94 cultivar. Our findings revealed that GABA significantly improved resistance in both cultivars to P. triticina, particularly in Morocco, by mitigating disease severity and reducing pustule density and size while extending both incubation and latent periods. This study assessed the effectiveness of two GABA application methods: plants received 1 mM GABA treatment, as a foliar spray, twenty-four hours prior to infection (pre-GABA), and plants received 1 mM GABA treatment both 24 h before and after infection (pre-/post-GABA), with the latter yielding significantly better results in reducing infection severity and improving plant resilience. Additionally, GABA application influenced stomatal behavior, promoting closure that may enhance resilience against leaf rust. GABA application on plants also modulated the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This led to a stronger oxidative burst in both susceptible and moderately resistant cultivars. GABA increased O2●- levels in guard cells and surrounding stomata, enhancing stomatal closure and the hypersensitive response. GABA enhanced the accumulation of soluble phenols and increased the activity of key antioxidant enzymes, catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POX), which are vital for managing oxidative stress. To the best of our knowledge, this investigation represents the first report into the impact of GABA on wheat leaf rust disease."

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with disruptions in glutamatergic and GABAergic activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), leading to altered synaptic formation and function. Low doses of ketamine rapidly rescue these deficits, inducing fast and sustained antidepressant effects. While it is suggested that ketamine produces a rapid glutamatergic enhancement in the mPFC, the temporal dynamics and the involvement of GABA interneurons in its sustained effects remain unclear. Using simultaneous photometry recordings of calcium activity in mPFC pyramidal and GABA neurons, as well as chemogenetic approaches in Gad1-Cre mice, we explored the hypothesis that initial effects of ketamine on glutamate signaling trigger subsequent enhancement of GABAergic responses, contributing to its sustained antidepressant responses. Calcium recordings revealed a biphasic effect of ketamine on activity of mPFC GABA neurons, characterized by an initial transient decrease (phase 1, <30 min) followed by an increase (phase 2, >60 min), in parallel with a transient increase in excitation/inhibition levels (10 min) and lasting enhancement of glutamatergic activity (30-120 min). Previous administration of ketamine enhanced GABA neuron activity during the sucrose splash test (SUST) and novelty suppressed feeding test (NSFT), 24 h and 72 h post-treatment, respectively. Chemogenetic inhibition of GABA interneurons during the surge of GABAergic activity (phase 2), or immediately before the SUST or NSFT, occluded ketamine's behavioral actions. These results indicate that time-dependent modulation of GABAergic activity is required for the sustained antidepressant-like responses induced by ketamine, suggesting that approaches to enhance GABAergic plasticity and function are promising therapeutic targets for antidepressant development.",

Motor incoordination is due to neuroinflammation and enhanced GABAergic neurotransmission in cerebellum. Recent reports support that probiotics, including L. casei, may improve cognitive function in different pathologies and MHE in cirrhotic patients. Extracellular vesicles (EV) are small cell-derived membrane vesicles that carry bioactive molecules released from cells, including bacteria. We hypothesized that EV from Lacticaseibacillus paracasei (LC-EV) could improve neuroinflammation, GABAergic neurotransmission and motor function in MHE.

Moreover, ex vivo treatment of cerebellar slices from hyperammonemic rats with LC-EV also reverses glial activation and neuroinflammation, and the enhancement of the TNFR1-S1PR2-BDNF-TrkB and TNFR1-TrkB-pAKT-NFκB-glutaminase-GAT3 pathways and of GABAergic neurotransmission.

METHODS: Forty young male western Albino rats, weighing approximately 60-70 g and aged 3-4 weeks, were used. In each of the six experimental groups, eight animals were treated as follows. The mice in the control group (I) received phosphate-buffered saline orally. For 3 days, the animals in the propionic acid (PPA)-treated groups (II and III) were given an oral neurotoxic dose of PPA (250 mg/kg body weight each day). Group II was euthanized after 3 days; however, Group III was left alive to be euthanized alongside the other groups. The animals were kept at 22 ± 1°C and allowed to access water and normal food as needed. Identical dosages of PPA were given to the rats in the three treatment groups (IV, V, and VI), and for 3 weeks, they were given the following treatments: 0.2 g/kg body weight of pure Bifidobacterium infantis, a probiotic mixture of PROTEXIN®, Somerset, UK and pure Lactobacillus bulgaricus, respectively. The six groups underwent measurements of serum zonulin and occludin as variables associated with leaky gut, glutathione, malondialdehyde, and catalase as oxidative stress-related variables, with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor gene expression. RESULTS: This study demonstrated the potential effects of pure or mixed probiotics in lowering zonulin and occludin as markers of increased intestinal permeability, enhancing GABA receptor expression, and reducing oxidative stress as neurotoxic effects of PPA. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that various probiotics protect gut barrier function and could be used to alleviate increased intestinal permeability caused by oxidative stress and impaired GABA signaling as a result of PPA neurotoxicity, addressing the clinical implications of probiotic supplements."

      "abstract": "The global growth of an aging population is expected to coincide with an increase in aging-related pathologies, including those related to brain health. Thus, the potential for accelerated cognitive health declines due to adverse aging is expected to have profound social and economic implications. However, the progression to pathological conditions is not an inevitable part of aging. In fact, engaging in activities that improve cardiovascular fitness appears to be a means that offers the benefits of maintaining and/or improving cognitive health in older age. However, to date, the underlying mechanisms responsible for improved central nervous system health and function with exercise are not yet fully elucidated. Consequently, there is considerable interest in studies aimed at understanding the neurophysiological benefits of exercise on aging. One such area of study suggests that the improvements in brain health via exercise are, in part, driven by the recovery of inhibitory processes related to the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In the present review, we highlight the opposing effects of aging and exercise on cortical inhibition and the GABAergic system's functional integrity. We highlight these changes in GABA function by reviewing work with in vivo measurements: transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). We also highlight recent and significant technological and methodological advances in assessing the GABAergic system's integrity with TMS and MRS. We then discuss potential future research directions to inform mechanistic GABA study targeted to improve health and function in aging. We conclude by highlighting the significance of understanding the effects of exercise and aging, its influence on GABA levels, and why a better understanding is crucial to allow for more targeted and effective interventions aimed to ultimately improve age-related decline in aging."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Visceral pain represents the most common digestive issue, frequently resulting from long-term inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel diseases. The lack of effective drugs prompted search of new therapeutic approaches. In this regard, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and Melissa officinalis (Mo) appear as excellent candidates as they were recognized to have several positive effects on the digestive system. The aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of a compound containing GABA and Mo (GABA-Mo 5:1) in inflammation-induced intestinal damage and visceral pain. METHODS: Colitis was induced in rats by intrarectal 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (DNBS) administration. DNBS-treated animals received GABA-Mo (80 mg/kg BID), starting 3 days before DNBS administration, until 14 days after colitis induction (preventive protocol), or starting 7 days after DNBS until day 21 (curative protocol). Visceral pain was assessed by measuring the viscero-motor response (VMR) and the abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) to colorectal distension on day 7, 14 (both protocols) and 21 (curative protocol) after DNBS administration. RESULTS: In the preventive protocol, GABA-Mo reduced AWR at day 14 but had no effect on VMR. In the spinal cord, treatment with GABA-Mo significantly prevented microglia reactivity (Iba-1 positive cells). In the colon, the supplement significantly decreased malondialdehyde (MDA, index of oxidative stress) and IL-1β levels and counteracted the decreased expression of claudin-1. Moreover, GABA-Mo normalized the increased levels of plasma lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP, index of altered intestinal permeability). In the curative protocol, GABA-Mo significantly counteracted visceral hypersensitivity persistence in DNBS-treated animals (day 14 and 21). In the spinal cord, GABA-Mo significantly reduced GFAP positive cell density (astrocytes). Histological evaluations highlighted a mild but significant effect of GABA-Mo in promoting healing from DNBS-induced colon damage. Colonic MDA and myeloperoxidase (index of leukocyte infiltration) levels were reduced, while the decreased colonic claudin-1 expression was normalized. In addition, the increased levels of plasma LBP were normalized by GABA-Mo administration. DISCUSSION: In conclusion GABA-Mo, particularly in the curative protocol, was able to reduce visceral pain and intestinal inflammation, likely through a reinforcement of intestinal barrier integrity, thus representing a suitable approach for the management of abdominal pain, especially in the remission stages of colitis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: GABAergic neurons in mouse ventral tegmental area (VTA) exhibit elevated activity during withdrawal following chronic ethanol exposure. While increased glutamatergic input and decreased GABAA receptor sensitivity have been implicated, the impact of inhibitory signaling in VTA GABA neurons has not been fully addressed. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We used electrophysiological and ultrastructural approaches to assess the impact of chronic intermittent ethanol vapour exposure in mice on GABAergic transmission in VTA GABA neurons during withdrawal. We used CRISPR/Cas9 ablation to mimic a somatodendritic adaptation involving the GABAB receptor (GABABR) in ethanol-naïve mice to investigate its impact on anxiety-related behaviour. KEY RESULTS: The frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents was reduced in VTA GABA neurons following chronic ethanol treatment and this was reversed by GABABR inhibition, suggesting chronic ethanol strengthens the GABABR-dependent suppression of GABAergic input to VTA GABA neurons. Similarly, paired-pulse depression of GABAA receptor-dependent responses evoked by optogenetic stimulation of nucleus accumbens inputs from ethanol-treated mice was reversed by GABABR inhibition. Somatodendritic currents evoked in VTA GABA neurons by GABABR activation were reduced following ethanol exposure, attributable to the suppression of GIRK (Kir3) channel activity. Mimicking this adaptation enhanced anxiety-related behaviour in ethanol-naïve mice. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Chronic ethanol weakens the GABAergic regulation of VTA GABA neurons in mice via pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms, likely contributing to their elevated activity during withdrawal and expression of anxiety-related behaviour. As anxiety can promote relapse during abstinence, interventions targeting VTA GABA neuron excitability could represent new therapeutic strategies for treatment of alcohol use disorder.",

      "abstract": "In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment, radiotherapy responses are not durable and toxicity limits therapy. We find that AM-101, a synthetic benzodiazepine activator of GABA(A) receptor, impairs the viability and clonogenicity of both primary and brain-metastatic NSCLC cells. Employing a human-relevant ex vivo 'chip', AM-101 is as efficacious as docetaxel, a chemotherapeutic used with radiotherapy for advanced-stage NSCLC. In vivo, AM-101 potentiates radiation, including conferring a significant survival benefit to mice bearing NSCLC intracranial tumors generated using a patient-derived metastatic line. GABA(A) receptor activation stimulates a selective-autophagic response via the multimerization of GABA(A) receptor-associated protein, GABARAP, the stabilization of mitochondrial receptor Nix, and the utilization of ubiquitin-binding protein p62. A high-affinity peptide disrupting Nix binding to GABARAP inhibits AM-101 cytotoxicity. This supports a model of GABA(A) receptor activation driving a GABARAP-Nix multimerization axis that triggers autophagy. In patients receiving radiotherapy, GABA(A) receptor activation may improve tumor control while allowing radiation dose de-intensification to reduce toxicity."

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress emerges as a prominent factor in the onset and progression of intestinal inflammation, primarily due to its critical role in damaging cells and tissues. GABAergic signaling is important in the occurrence and development of various intestinal disorders, yet its effect on oxidative stress remains unclear. We attempted to assess whether GABAergic signaling participated in the regulation of oxidative stress during enteritis. The results showed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) significantly decreased γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in the ileal tissues of mice. Interestingly, the application of GABA significantly repressed the shedding of intestinal mucosal epithelial cells and inflammatory cell infiltration, inhibited the expressions of proinflammatory factors, including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, and enhanced the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10, indicating that GABA could alleviate enteritis in mice. This observation was further supported by transcriptome sequencing, revealing a total of 271 differentially expressed genes, which exhibited a marked enrichment of inflammatory and immune-related pathways, alongside a prominent enhancement of GABA B receptor (GABABR) signaling following GABA administration. Effectively, Baclofen pretreatment alleviated intestinal mucosal damage in LPS-induced mice, suppressed proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha expressions, and boosted total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione (GSH) levels. Moreover, Baclofen notably enhanced the viability of LPS-stimulated IPEC-J2 cells, contracted the proinflammatory secretion factors, and reinforced SOD, GSH, and catalase levels, emphasizing the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects associated with GABABR activation. Mechanistically, Baclofen restrained the mRNA and protein levels of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), and inducible nitric oxide synthase, while elevating nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 and heme oxygenase-1 in both mice and IPEC-J2 cells, indicating that activating GABABR strengthened antioxidant abilities by interrupting the TLR4/MyD88/NLRP3 pathway. Furthermore, 16S rDNA analysis demonstrated that Baclofen increased the relative abundance of probiotic, particularly Lactobacillus, renowned for its antioxidant properties, while reducing the relative richness of harmful bacteria, predominantly Enterobacteriaceae, suggesting that GABABR signaling may have contributed to reversing intestinal flora imbalances to relieve oxidative stress in LPS-induced mice. Our study identified previously unappreciated roles for GABABR signaling in constricting oxidative stress to attenuate enteritis, thus offering novel insights for the treatment of intestinal inflammation."

      "abstract": "Population aging is a global reality driven by increased life expectancy. This demographic phenomenon is intrinsically linked to the epidemic of cognitive disorders such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease, posing challenges for elderly and their families. In this context, the search for new therapeutic strategies to prevent or minimize cognitive impairments becomes urgent, as these deficits are primarily associated with oxidative damage and increased neuroinflammation. Ferulic acid (FA), a natural and potent antioxidant compound, is proposed to be nanoencapsulated to target the central nervous system effectively with lower doses and an extended duration of action. Here, we evaluated the effects of the nanoencapsulated FA on d-galactose (d-Gal)- induced memory impairments. Male Wistar adult rats were treated with ferulic acid-loaded nanocapsules (FA-Nc) or non-encapsulated ferulic acid (D-FA) for 8 weeks concurrently with d-Gal (150 mg/kg s.c.) injection. As expected, our findings showed that d-Gal injection impaired memory processes and increased anxiety behavior, whereas FA-Nc treatment ameliorated these behavioral impairments associated with the aging process induced by d-Gal. At the molecular level, nanoencapsulated ferulic acid (FA-Nc) ameliorated the decrease in ACh and glutamate induced by d-galactose (d-Gal), and also increased GABA levels in the dorsal hippocampus, indicating its therapeutic superiority. Additional studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying our current promising outcomes. Nanoscience applied to pharmacology can reduce drug dosage, thereby minimizing adverse effects while enhancing therapeutic response, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging. Therefore, the strategy of brain-targeted drug delivery through nanoencapsulation can be effective in mitigating aging-related factors that may lead to cognitive deficits.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High GABA levels and its conversion to succinate via the GABA shunt are known to be associated with abiotic and biotic stress tolerance in plants. The exact mode of action is still under debate and it is not yet clear whether GABA is a common component of the plant stress defense process or not. We hypothesized that if it is a common route for stress tolerance, activation of GABA-shunt by a biotic stressor might also function in increased abiotic stress tolerance. To test this, Brassica napus plants treated with Flagellin-22 (Flg-22) were exposed to drought stress and the differences in GABA levels along with GABA-shunt components (biosynthetic and catabolic enzyme activities) in the leaf and root samples were compared. In order to provide a better outlook, MYC2, MPK6 and ZAT12, expression profiles were also analyzed since these genes were recently proposed to function in abiotic and biotic stress tolerance. RESULTS: Briefly, we found that Flg treatment increased drought stress tolerance in B. napus via GABA-shunt and the MAPK cascade was involved while the onset was different between leaves and roots. Flg treatment promoted GABA biosynthesis with increased GABA content and GAD activity in the leaves. Better performance of the Flg treated plants under drought stress might be dependent on the activation of GABA-shunt which provides succinate to TCA since GABA-T and SSADH activities were highly induced in the leaves and roots. In the transcript analysis, Flg + drought stressed groups had higher MYC2 transcript abundances correlated well with the GABA content and GABA-shunt while, MPK6 expression was induced only in the roots of the Flg + drought stressed groups. ZAT12 was also induced both in leaves and roots as a result of Flg-22 treatment. However, correlation with GABA and GABA-shunt could be proposed only in Flg + drought stressed group. CONCLUSION: We provided solid data on how GABA-shunt and Fgl-22 are interacting against abiotic stress in leaf and root tissues. Fgl-22 induced ETI activated GABA-shunt with a plausible cross talk between MYC2 and ZAT12 transcription factors for drought stress tolerance in B. napus.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The α6 subunit-containing GABAA receptors (α6GABAARs) are highly expressed in the trigeminal ganglia (TG), the sensory hub of the trigeminovascular system (TGVS). Hypo-GABAergic transmission in the TG was reported to contribute to migraine-related behavioral and histopathological phenotypes. Previously, we found that Compound 6, an α6GABAAR-selective positive allosteric modulator (PAM), significantly alleviated TGVS activation-induced peripheral and central sensitization in a capsaicin-induced migraine-mimicking model. METHODS: Here, we tested whether the deuterated analogues of Compound 6, namely DK-1-56-1 and RV-I-29, known to have longer half-lives than the parent compound, can exert a similar therapeutic effect in the same model. The activation of TGVS was triggered by intra-cisternal (i.c.) instillation of capsaicin in male Wistar rats. Centrally, i.c. capsaicin increased the quantity of c-Fos-immunoreactive (c-Fos-ir) neurons in the trigeminal cervical complex (TCC). Peripherally, it increased the calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactivity (CGRP-ir) in TG, and caused CGRP release, leading to CGRP depletion in the dura mater. RESULTS: DK-I-56-1 and RV-I-29, administered intraperitoneally (i.p.), significantly ameliorated the TCC neuronal activation, TG CGRP-ir elevation, and dural CGRP depletion induced by capsaicin, with DK-I-56-1 demonstrating better efficacy. The therapeutic effects of 3 mg/kg DK-I-56-1 are comparable to that of 30 mg/kg topiramate. Notably, i.p. administered furosemide, a blood-brain-barrier impermeable α6GABAAR-selective antagonist, prevented the effects of DK-I-56-1 and RV-I-29. Lastly, orally administered DK-I-56-1 has a similar pharmacological effect. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that DK-I-56-1 is a promising candidate for novel migraine pharmacotherapy, through positively modulating TG α6GABAARs to inhibit TGVS activation, with relatively favourable pharmacokinetic properties."

Endogenous neuroactive steroids including β-estradiol and pregnenolone sulfate negatively modulate the function of ρ1 GABAA receptors, but their inhibitory mechanisms are not clear. By combining five cryo-EM structures with electrophysiology and molecular dynamics simulations, we characterize binding sites and negative modulation mechanisms of β-estradiol and pregnenolone sulfate at the human ρ1 GABAA receptor. β-estradiol binds in a pocket at the interface between extracellular and transmembrane domains, apparently specific to the ρ subfamily, and disturbs allosteric conformational transitions linking GABA binding to pore opening. In contrast, pregnenolone sulfate binds inside the pore to block ion permeation, with a preference for activated structures. These results illuminate contrasting mechanisms of ρ1 inhibition by two different neuroactive steroids, with potential implications for subtype-specific gating and pharmacological design.",

      "abstract": "The Antisecretory Factor (AF) is a protein that can reduce intestinal hypersecretion and various inflammation disorders in vivo. Discovered in many mammalian tissues and plasma, its mechanism of action remains unknown. Interestingly, its induction has been found to counteract vertigo in patients with Méniere's disease. This suggests an inherent ability to control body balance and posture, an activity that may play a role in cerebellar function. Therefore, it may be worthwhile to investigate whether this activity can inhibit neuronal cells involved in cerebellar circuitries and its potential action on enteric nervous system ganglia, which could explain its antisecretory effect in the intestine. Previously, we studied the role of AF on GABAA receptors in cerebellar granule cells, taking advantage of electrophysiology and evaluating the effects of the administration of AF-16, an AF peptide. Treatment with AF-16 increased GABAA receptor responses, especially those containing the α6 subunit. Here, we performed immunofluorescence experiments by staining α1 and α6 subunits before and after incubation with AF-16, analyzed super-resolved images comparing pre- and post-treatment maps and critically examined these experimental results with our previous electrophysiological data to shed light on the mechanisms of action of AF protein on GABAA receptor subpopulations, specifically the \"fast\" receptors of αn β2/3 γ2 composition that contain either the α1 or the α6 subunit. The results indicate that the α6 subunit is redistributed, with a decrease in neurites and an increase in soma. Conversely, the α1 subunit shows opposite results, with an increase in neurites and a decrease in soma."

However, its sedative and hypnotic effects are yet to be discovered. This study aimed to evaluate its sedative/hypnotic effect on Swiss mice. Additionally, in silico studies were also performed to see the possible molecular mechanisms behind the tested neurological effect. For this, male Swiss albino mice were treated with DZN (5, 10, or 20 mg/kg) intraperitoneally (i.p.) with or without the standard GABAergic medication diazepam (DZP) and/or flumazenil (FLU) and checked for the onset and duration of sleeping time using thiopental sodium-induced as well as DZP-induced sleeping tests. A molecular docking study was also performed to check its interaction capacity with the α1 and β2 subunits of the GABAA receptor. Findings suggest that DZN dose-dependently and significantly reduced the latency while increasing the duration of sleep in animals. In combination therapy, DZN shows synergistic effects with the DZP-2 and DZP-2 + FLU-0.01 groups, resulting in significantly (p < 0.05) reduced latency and increased sleep duration. Further, molecular docking studies demonstrate that DZN has a strong binding affinity of - 7.2 kcal/mol, which is closer to the standard ligand DZP (- 8.3 kcal/mol) against the GABAA (6X3X) receptor. Molecular dynamic simulations indicated stability and similar binding locations for DZP and DZN with 6X3X. In conclusion, DZN shows sedative effects on Swiss mice, possibly through the GABAA receptor interaction pathway.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is identified in individuals who experienced 2 or more unprovoked seizures occurring over 24 hours apart, which can have a profound impact on a person's neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social well-being. Epilepsy is considerably diverse, with classifications such as genetic epilepsy that result directly from a known or presumed genetic variant with the core symptoms of seizures. The GABAA receptor primarily functions as a heteropentamer, containing 3 of 8 subunit types: α, β, γ, δ, ε, π, θ, and ρ. In the adult brain, the GABAA receptor is the primary inhibitory component in neural networks. The involvement of GABAA receptors in the pathogenesis of epilepsy has been proposed. We extensively reviewed all relevant clinical data of previously published cases of GABAA receptor subunit γ2, δ, β1-3 variants included in PubMed up to February 2024, including the variant types, loci, postulated mechanisms, their relevant regions, first onset ages, and phenotypes. We summarized the postulated mechanisms of epileptic pathogenesis. We also divided the collected 206 cases of epilepsy into 4 epileptic phenotypes: genetic generalized epilepsies, focal epilepsy, developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, and epilepsy with fever sensibility. We showed that there were significant differences in the likelihood of the γ2, β2, and β3 subunit variants causing genetic generalized epilepsies, focal epilepsy, developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, and epilepsy with fever sensibility. Patients with the β3 subunit variant seemed related to an earlier first onset age. Our review supports that GABAA receptor subunit variants are a crucial area of epilepsy research and treatment exploration.",

In the present study, we demonstrated that the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) upregulates GAT1 and GAT3 expression in the brain, which resulted in cognitive dysfunction. Genetic and pharmacological intervention of STING suppressed the expression of both GAT1 and GAT3, increased the ambient GABA concentration, and therefore, enhanced tonic GABAA inhibition of principal hippocampal neurons, resulting in spatial learning and working memory deficits in mice in a type I interferon-independent manner.

      "abstract": "The impacts of L-glutamate (L-Glu) treatment on chilling injury (CI), Ca2+ signaling, mitochondrial ultrastructure, and metabolisms of reactive oxygen species (ROS), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), energy of prune fruit under chilling stress were studied. The results found that the optimal concentration of L-Glu to suppress CI occurrence and maintain quality in prune fruit was 0.1 g L-1, which also enhanced the PdGLRs expression, cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration, the contents of CaM, and CML under cold stress. Moreover, L-Glu treatment could reduce ROS accumulation and increase GABA content, and energy level, contributing to maintaining the integrity of the mitochondrial structure in cold-stored prune fruit. More importantly, PdGLRs expression and CaM/CML content positively correlated with antioxidant enzyme activities, GABA shunt, and energy status in prune fruit. These results indicated that the enhanced cold resistance of L-Glu-treated prunes might be attributed to the activated Ca2+ signaling, thus improving the antioxidant capacity, GABA, and energy levels.",

      "abstract": "Degenerative conditions, such as neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD)) and cardiovascular diseases, are complex, multifactorial disorders whose pathophysiology has not been fully elucidated yet. As a result, the available treatment options cannot eliminate these diseases radically, but only alleviate the symptoms. Both inflammatory processes and oxidation are key factors in the development and evolution of neurodegeneration, while acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are the most used therapeutic options against AD. In this work, following the multi-targeting compound approach, we designed and synthesized a series of proline and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) amides with various acidic moieties that possess an antioxidant and/or anti-inflammatory potency. Proline is the pharmacophore of nootropic drugs (e.g., piracetam) used for memory improvement, while GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. The designed molecules were subjected to a preliminary screening of their bioactivity in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory assays, as well as against acetylcholinesterase. Most of the synthesized compounds could inhibit lipid peroxidation (IC50 as low as 8 μΜ) and oxidative protein glycation (inhibition of up to 48%) and reduce the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical (DPPH). In addition, all of the compounds were moderate inhibitors of lipoxygenase (LOX) (up to 46% at 100 μΜ) and could decrease carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats by up to 55%. Finally, some of the compounds were moderate acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (IC50 as low as 219 μΜ). The results confirmed the design rationale, indicating that the compounds could be further optimized as multi-targeting molecules directed against degenerative conditions.",

      "abstract": "Avocado (Persea americana Mill.) is a subtropical climacteric fruit with a limited shelf life due to its high sensitivity to low temperatures. Chilling injury (CI) produced by cold storage displays symptoms in avocado fruit such as irregular ripening, darkening of the mesocarp, hardening of vascular strands, lipid oxidation with \"off flavors\", and pitting and darkening of the skin, increasing weight loss. Accordingly, we studied the effect of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) alone or in combination as postharvest treatments to maintain quality and to increase cold tolerance. Hass avocados were stored at 5 °C plus 5 days at room temperature. The results showed that the combined treatment improved fruit quality parameters as compared with control fruit and with those treated with only 1-MCP or GABA. The combined treatment delayed synergistically the postharvest ripening process. This delayed pattern was concomitant with a delayed ethylene pattern in GABA + 1-MCP or 1-MCP fruit batches. CI symptoms and electrolyte leakage were minimized in all GABA and 1-MCP fruit batches specifically in the combined treatment. For this reason, the synergistic effect of the combination of treatments may be recommended as an effective alternative strategy to prolong the postharvest quality of avocado during refrigerated storage."

      "abstract": "AIM: Molecular alterations of diabetic gastroenteropathy are poorly identified. This study investigates the effects of prolonged GABA supplementation on key protein expression levels of trypsin-1, PAR-1, PAR-2, PAR-3, PI3K, Akt, COX-2, GABAA, and GABAB receptors in the gastric tissue of type 2 diabetic rats (T2DM). METHOD: To induce T2DM, a 3-month high-fat diet and 35 mg/kg of streptozotocin was used. Twenty-four male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups: (1) control, (2) T2DM, (3) insulin-treated (2.5 U/kg), and (4) GABA-treated (1.5 g/kg GABA). Blood glucose was measured weekly. The protein expressions were assessed using western blotting. Histopathological changes were examined by H&E and Masson's staining. RESULTS: Diabetic rats show reduced NOS1 and elevated COX-2 and trypsin-1 protein expression levels in gastric tissue. Insulin and GABA therapy restored the NOS1 and COX-2 levels to control values. Insulin treatment increased PI3K, Akt, and p-Akt and, decreased trypsin-1, PAR-1, PAR-2, and PAR-3 levels in the diabetic rats. Levels of GABAA and GABAB receptors normalized following insulin and GABA therapy. H&E staining indicated an increase in mucin secretion following GABA treatment. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that GABA by acting on GABA receptors may regulate the trypsin-1/PARs/Akt/COX-2 pathway and thereby improve complications of diabetic gastroenteropathy.",

      "abstract": "The coronaridine congeners catharanthine and 18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC) display sedative, anxiolytic, and antidepressant properties by acting on mechanisms involving GABAergic and/or monoaminergic transmissions. Here, we expanded their pharmacological properties by studying their anticonvulsant activity in male and female mice using the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizure test. To determine potential neurochemical mechanisms, the effect of congeners on monoamine content and kainic acid (KA)-induced epileptiform discharge was studied in the hippocampus. The behavioral results showed that coronaridine congeners induce acute anticonvulsant activity in a dose-dependent but sex-independent manner. Repeated treatment with a subthreshold dose (20 mg/kg) of each congener produced anticonvulsant activity in a sex-independent manner, but was significantly higher in male mice when compared to its acute effect. Using a behaviourally relevant regimen, we found that PTZ increased dopamine metabolites and serotonin tissue content. Coronaridine congeners, which induced distinct effects on monoamines, blunted the effect of PTZ instead of potentiating it, suggesting the existence of another mechanism in their anticonvulsant activity. The electrophysiological results indicated that both congeners inhibit KA-induced epileptiform discharges in hippocampal slices. A key aspect of this study is that the activity of both congeners was observed only in the presence of GABA, supporting the notion that hippocampal GABAAR potentiation plays an important role. Our study showed that coronaridine congeners induce acute anticonvulsant activity in a sex-independent manner. However, a comparatively higher susceptibility was observed in male mice after repeated treatment. The underlying hippocampal mechanisms mainly involve GABAAR potentiation, whereas monoamines play a minor role in the anticonvulsive action.",
