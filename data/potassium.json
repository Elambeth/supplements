      "abstract": "Purple sweet potato (PSP) (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam) is a nutrient-rich \"K-favoring\" crop. The reasonable application of potassium is an important means of improving the quality and yield of PSP. We designed four different forms of potassium fertilizer treatments: K2SO4, KCl, KH2PO4, and K2HPO4, and used qRT-PCR and HPLC techniques to explore their differences in anthocyanin synthesis, accumulation, quality, and yield in PSP tubers. Our findings indicate that potassium fertilizer treatment enhances the expression of structural genes such as CHI (chalcone--flavonone isomerase), F3H (naringenin,2-oxogluturate 3-dioxygenase-like), F3‧H (flavonoid 3'-monooxygenase), ANS (leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase-like), DFR (dihydroflavonol 4-reductase-like), and CHS (chalcone synthase), which encode key enzymes of the anthocyanin metabolism pathway. This is achieved by stimulating the high levels of expression of the transcription factor MYB, which controls anthocyanin accumulation. Consequently, this leads to increased activities of key anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL, EC 4.3.1.5), chalcone isomerase (CHI, EC 5.5.1.6), dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR, EC 1.1.1.219), and UDP-galactose flavonoid 3-O-galactosyltransferase (UFGT, EC 2.4.1.234), thereby promoting the synthesis and accumulation of anthocyanins within PSP tubers. This ultimately improves tuber quality and yield. Analysis conducted through hierarchical clustering heat map, principal component analysis (PCA), and comprehensive evaluation revealed that PSP exhibits varying sensitivities to different forms of potassium fertilizer, with KCl treatment significantly enhancing anthocyanin production efficiency. Our results will provide a theoretical basis and data support for the rational selection of potassium fertilizer types for actual PSP production.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress is a significant factor affecting reproductive efficiency in dairy cows, contributing to conditions such as endometritis that impair fertility and milk production. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms by which bta-let-7d modulates the oxidative stress responses induced by potassium permanganate (KMnO4) in bovine endometrial epithelial cells (BEECs). Using KMnO4 to induce oxidative stress, we observed significant increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, accompanied by decreased activities of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Quantitative PCR and Western blot analyses indicated a negative correlation between IGF1R and bta-let-7d expression in oxidative-stress-affected tissues, suggesting opposing roles in managing stress responses. Following KMnO4 treatment, there was marked downregulation of anti-apoptotic genes and an upregulation of pro-apoptotic markers, alongside diminished antioxidant capacity. Mechanistically, bta-let-7d targets IGF1R, leading to the suppression of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and exacerbating oxidative damage. In vivo experiments further confirmed the impact of KMnO4 exposure on IGF1R expression. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms by which KMnO4 induces oxidative stress and apoptosis in bovine uterus. They highlight the potential for therapeutic strategies targeting the bta-let-7d/IGF1R axis to enhance reproductive health management in dairy cows, offering a promising avenue for mitigating oxidative-stress-related reproductive disorders."

      "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting approximately 1% of the global population, yet current diagnostic tools for early-stage RA lack sensitivity and fail to identify optimal treatment candidates. Voltage-gated potassium channel 1.3 (Kv1.3) plays a crucial role in immune cell activation, particularly in effector memory T lymphocytes and macrophages, which drive inflammation in active RA. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a novel Kv1.3-targeted radiopharmaceutical, [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-anti-Kv1.3, for precise monitoring and quantification of joint inflammation in a mouse model of RA. PET imaging revealed significantly higher radioactivity concentration in inflamed joints compared to normal joints at all time points, with peak uptake of 11.73 %ID/g at 4 h postinjection compared to 1.55 %ID/g in noninflamed joints. Histological analysis confirmed the presence of T lymphocytes and macrophages in inflamed tissues and their high Kv1.3 expression. Additionally, tracer uptake correlated strongly with clinical arthritis scores (Pearson r = 0.8789, p < 0.0001), demonstrating the probe's sensitivity in tracking arthritis progression. This study successfully developed a 68Ga-labeled Kv1.3-targeting radiopharmaceutical that enables visualization of active inflammation in arthritic joints, showing high sensitivity for early RA diagnosis and disease monitoring. This approach offers potential for guiding immune-targeted therapies and assessing the treatment efficacy in RA."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Potassium binders mitigate hyperkalemia, allowing patients to maintain their renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system inhibitor (RAASi) treatment. This study characterized patients treated with first- or second-generation potassium binders, usage patterns and their effectiveness in reducing potassium levels, and changes in RAASi treatment in a Swedish population-based study. METHODS: A National Cohort included patients who had record of a treatment episode with a first-generation or second-generation potassium binder between 2018 and 2022. A Mid-Sweden Cohort included patients from the National Cohort who also had a record of a potassium measurement within the 60 days prior to beginning potassium binder treatment. Comorbidities, prior medication use, persistence with potassium binder treatment, subsequent changes in potassium levels and RAASi treatment were evaluated. Persistence was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and changes in potassium levels were assessed using linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: 23,892 treatment episodes involving 14,235 patients (mean age 70 years, 33% women) were followed in the National Cohort, and 4860 episodes involving 3179 patients (mean age 72 years, 34% women) in the Mid-Sweden Cohort. Patients treated with second-generation potassium binders had more comorbidities and higher median persistence with treatment compared to those on first-generation potassium binders, 112.5 (95% CI:112.5-117.5) vs. 87.5 (95% CI: 87.5-87.5) days in the National Cohort; 165.5 (95% CI: 121.0-198.0) vs. 97.6 (95% CI: 87.5-110.0) days in the Mid-Sweden Cohort. Both first- and second-generation potassium binders reduced potassium levels from baseline by day 15, 5.7 [95% CI: 4.5-6.8] mmol/L to 4.7 [95% CI: 3.6-5.9] mmol/L and 5.5 (95% CI: 4.3-6.7) mmol/L to 4.9 (95% CI: 3.8-6.1) mmol/L, respectively. Dose reduction or discontinuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) was found in 31.4% and 47.7%, respectively, within 120 days of initiating therapy. CONCLUSION: Both potassium binders effectively reduced potassium levels, but frequent discontinuation or dose reduction of RAASi therapy were still observed during this period. The adjustments of RAASi therapy, despite the achievement of normokalemia within 15 days, may be premature and warrants careful reconsideration to ensure optimal patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Severe hyperkalemia is a life-threatening emergency requiring prompt management and close surveillance. Although artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiography (AI-ECG) has been developed to rapidly detect hyperkalemia, its application to monitor potassium (K+) levels remains unassessed. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of AI-ECG for monitoring K+ levels in patients with severe hyperkalemia. METHODS: This retrospective study was performed at an emergency department of a single medical center over 2.5 years. Patients with severe hyperkalemia defined as Lab-K+ ≥6.5 mmol/l with matched ECG-K+ ≥5.5 mmol/l were included. ECG-K+ was quantified by ECG12Net analysis of the AI-ECG system. The following paired ECG-K+ and Lab-K+ were measured at least twice, almost simultaneously, during and after K+-lowering therapy in 1 day. Clinical characteristics, pertinent intervention, and laboratory data were analyzed. RESULTS: Seventy-six patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria exhibited initial Lab-K+ 7.4 ± 0.7 and ECG-K+ 6.8 ± 0.5 mmol/l. Most of them had chronic kidney disease (CKD) or were on chronic hemodialysis (HD). The followed Lab-K+ and ECG-K+ measured with a mean time difference of 11.4 ± 5.6 minutes significantly declined in parallel both in patients treated medically (n = 39) and with HD (n = 37). However, there was greater decrement in Lab-K⁺ (mean 7.3 to 4.1) than ECG-K⁺ (mean 6.6 to 5.0) shortly after HD. Three patients with persistent ECG-K+ hyperkalemia despite normalized Lab-K+ exhibited concomitant acute cardiovascular comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: AI-ECG for K+ prediction may help monitor K+ level for severe hyperkalemia and reveal more severe cardiac disorders in the patients with persistent AI-ECG hyperkalemia."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the drug of choice to prevent upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding in patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT); however, unmet needs remain. Potassium-competitive acid blockers (P-CABs) are novel acid-suppressive drugs that have emerged as potential alternatives. We evaluated the effectiveness of P-CAB in reducing the risk of UGI bleeding in patients receiving DAPT after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients with PCI on DAPT between January 2019 and January 2023 using the Korean nationwide health claims database. The primary outcome was admission for UGI bleeding within 6 months of PCI. A multivariate Cox regression model was used to evaluate UGI bleeding risk based on PPIs and P-CAB use. RESULTS: Of the 210 447 patients who underwent PCI on DAPT (mean age, 65.5 years; 74.7% men), 4.6% and 47.5% patients were prescribed P-CABs and PPIs, respectively. Overall, 0.3% of patients experienced UGI bleeding within 6 months of PCI. P-CAB users had a reduced risk of UGI bleeding (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.92; p = 0.019) compared with patients not receiving P-CAB or PPI. No significant difference was observed between the P-CAB and PPI users (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Among Korean patients undergoing PCI with DAPT, P-CABs reduced UGI bleeding comparably to PPIs. These findings suggest that P-CABs are potential alternatives to PPIs for preventing UGI bleeding."

      "abstract": "Salt stress disrupts ionic homeostasis and induces oxidative damage, leading to reduced plant growth and development. Determining the lethal dose of NaCl is essential for developing effective mitigation strategies. Potassium and other antioxidant regulatory compounds often prove insufficient in addressing salt-induced toxicity, especially in wheat. This laboratory experiment aimed to determine NaCl concentration that reduces plant growth by 50% and to evaluate the effectiveness of different mitigation approaches involving potassium and thiourea supplementation at 0 mM, 10 mM, and 15 mM under the identified NaCl condition. The experiment followed a factorial arrangement with three biological replications. Results showed that NaCl at 198 mM decreased germination and plant growth by 50%. The combined application of potassium and thiourea at 15 mM significantly improved ionic homeostasis, leading to a 14% increase in overall ion balance. This was achieved by reducing sodium ions concentration by 28.55% and increasing potassium ion concentration by 23.92%. Furthermore, the interactive application enhances various growth parameters, including shoot and root length (by 14.20-32.82%), and shoot/root fresh and dry weight (by 18.56/8.89% to 26.60/25.52%, respectively). These improvements were attributed to enhanced physiological processes, including a 10.23% increase in net photosynthetic rate, a 30.20% increase in stomatal conductance, a 6.70% increase in transpiration rate, an 8.12% increase in internal carbon dioxide concentrations and a 10.13% improvement in relative water content. Additionally, oxidative markers, such as hydrogen peroxide and malonaldeahyde, were reduced by 8.43% and 26.20%, respectively. This reduction was associated with increased antioxidant enzyme activity, including a 13.69% increase in superoxide dismutase, an 8.91% increase in catalase, a 20.18% increase in peroxidase, and a 13.11% increase in ascorbate peroxidase. The decrease in oxidative stress contributed to an 8.48% improvement in membrane stability and a 17.06% enhancement in relative water content. Principle component analysis confirmed the efficacy of the K15 + TU15 treatment in improving wheat salt tolerance. The simultaneous application of K and TU at 15 mM effectively mitigated salt-induced toxicity by enhancing ionic homeostasis and reducing oxidative stress through increased antioxidant enzyme activity in wheat.",

We report genotype-phenotype information on a set of patients clinically diagnosed with maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY), and carrying coding variants in the KATP regulatory subunit gene ABCC8. In contrast to the naïve prediction that diabetes should be associated with KATP gain-of-function (GOF, as in KATP-dependent neonatal diabetes) each mutation caused mild to severe loss-of-function (LOF), through distinct molecular mechanisms, suggesting the affected individuals may have crossed over to glucose intolerance from KATP channel LOF-dependent congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI). Our data provide definitive support for a paradoxical form of MODY in association with KATP channel LOF, genetically and mechanistically distinct from a late diagnosis of diabetes resulting from KATP GOF. To avoid confusion and inappropriate treatment efforts, we argue that diabetes driven by KATP-GOF and KATP-LOF mutations should be officially recognized as distinct diseases."

In this study, we aimed to investigate the atrial electrophysiological properties that may underlie sex-differences in AF incidence in the younger population, focusing on IK1, a cardiac ion current important for action potential (AP) stability and triggered activity. METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed sex-differences in P-wave morphology in 12-lead ECG in healthy young New Zealand White rabbits. Males presented longer P-wave duration and larger P-wave area compared to females. Patch-clamp experiments were performed in isolated rabbit atrial cardiomyocytes (CMs). Male atrial CMs presented higher DAD incidence, amplitude, and area under the curve (AUC) than females, potentially facilitating the presence of atrial triggered activity in males. Male atrial CMs showed a less hyperpolarized resting membrane potential (RMP), a 50% smaller IK1, and a 26% reduction in Kir2.1 protein expression, a pore forming subunit of IK1, than females. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) effects were investigated acutely and semi-chronically ex vivo. Experiments showed that the sex-difference in IK1 could be mimicked by DHT. In female atrial CMs, acute and semi-chronic (24h) DHT administration reduced IK1. In the presence of a PKC-inhibitor, DHT-mediated IK1 reduction was not observed in atrial female CMs, suggesting it to be PKC-mediated. Chronic DHT-effects were investigated in vivo in female rabbits after hormone-releasing pellet implantation. After two weeks, animals showed a significantly prolonged and larger P-wave, a smaller atrial IK1 and a trend towards an increased DAD amplitude and AUC. CONCLUSIONS: Sex impacts on atrial electrophysiology, leading to sex-differences in P-wave morphology, triggered activity, RMP, and IK1. These sex-differences can be mimicked by sex hormone-treatment, suggesting that sex hormones ‒ particularly DHT ‒ play a pivotal role in mediating sex-differences in atrial electrophysiology. Such sex-differences might impact on the propensity to develop AF, particularly in the younger population."

Methods for their site-specific modification offer immense potential for enhancing their therapeutic applications, but established approaches, such as fusion proteins, have well-known limitations in the nanobody format. Here, we report a convenient and broadly applicable method for site-specifically functionalizing a single residue near the C-terminus of VHH nanobodies by employing lysine acylation using conjugating enzymes (LACE) to transfer short peptides bearing functional group handles for potassium acyltrifluoroborate (KAT) ligations onto a single lysine residue of the expressed nanobodies. This approach requires a LACE tag (4 residues or 11 residues) in the recombinant nanobodies and enables direct elaboration of the products via a rapid amide forming reaction. In this study, VHH nanobodies expressed in Escherichia coli could be efficiently modified through the transfer of specific chemical handles, enabling their conjugation to small molecules, nanobodies, and antibodies by chemoselective, amide-forming KAT ligations that operate at micromolar concentrations."

METHODS: The primary analyses of the Salt Substitute and Stroke Study (SSaSS) defined the effects of sodium-reduced potassium-enriched salt substitutes compared to regular salt on the risk of stroke. This post-hoc investigation explored effects on stomach and other cancers. SSaSS was an open-label, cluster randomised controlled trial done in 600 Chinese villages among 20,996 participants. Villages were assigned at random in a 1:1 ratio to receive sodium-reduced potassium-enriched salt substitutes or continue regular salt use. Fatal and hospitalised cancer events were identified through direct face-to-face follow-up and record linkage, with adjudication of fatal, but not non-fatal events. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 4.7 years, there were 1040 cancer events (507 fatal, 533 non-fatal) recorded. There were 212 stomach cancers, 725 other cancers, and 103 cancers with an unknown primary site. There was a trend toward but not a significant effect of randomised treatment on total stomach cancer (rate ratio (RR) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 1.08). The RR for adjudicated fatal stomach cancer was 0.66 (95% CI 0.44 to 1.00) compared to 0.88 (95% CI 0.56 to 1.37) for unadjudicated non-fatal stomach cancer. There was no detectable effect on total cancer at any site (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.08), adjudicated fatal cancer at any site (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.05), or unadjudicated non-fatal cancer at any site (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.23). CONCLUSIONS: There was no effect of sodium-reduced potassium-enriched salt substitutes on stomach cancer or other cancer types detected. Trends toward protection against fatal and non-fatal stomach cancer align with the observational epidemiology and warrant further investigation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT02092090.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) and calcium polystyrene sulfonate (CPS) are indicated for treating hyperkalemia in chronic renal disease. Individuals undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD) are at significantly increased risk of developing hyperkalemia, clinically defined as serum potassium concentrations of > 5.0 mmol/L. The objective of this study was the evaluation and comparison of the efficacy and safety of two potassium binders (SZC and CPS) in HD patients with hyperkalemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This research utilized a prospective non-randomized controlled clinical trial design. Patients with chronic hyperkalemia were enrolled at a tertiary care hospital in China from September 2021 to May 2022. HD patients received SZC (5 g) or CPS (5 g) once daily, later adjusted to 10 g. Serum potassium levels were quantified at a specified timepoint at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. RESULTS: The mean serum K+ levels for SZC- and CPS-treated participants were 5.93 ± 0.46 and 5.88 ± 0.54 mmol/L, respectively, at baseline (p = 0.683) and 4.94 ± 0.44 vs. 5.12 ± 0.49 mmol/L respectively after 12 weeks (p = 0.017). A serum potassium concentration of less than 5.3 mmol/L was achieved in 81% of treated patients who received SZC treatment over 12 weeks, compared to 65% of those treated with CPS. Additionally, SZC also achieved a higher percentage of patients exhibiting serum potassium levels below 6.0 mmol/L at the 2-week timepoint (28/28 vs. 27/31, p = 0.015). The mean daily doses were 6.8 g for SZC and 7.42 g for CPS, with no serious adverse events attributable to the study drug. CONCLUSION: SZC demonstrated superior effectiveness in reducing potassium levels and controlling severe hyperkalemia in patients undergoing maintenance HD. It also facilitated more rapid control of serum potassium levels offering an improved long-term management strategy for chronic hyperkalemia."

      "abstract": "Multiple biological activities of coenzyme Q10 have been demonstrated, opening up opportunities for research and development. However, the biological action of potassium polyacrylate and its effect on the mitochondrial permeability transition pores are both poorly understood. Therefore, this study investigated the in vitro antioxidative potential of potassium polyacrylate (PCK) and coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and their effects on mitochondrial permeability transition pores. In vitro antioxidant and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activities were assessed using standard methods, and lipid peroxidation was also determined. Mitochondrial swelling was evaluated as the change in absorbance under succinate-energized conditions. Cytochrome c release and mitochondrial ATPase activity were assessed. The results showed that PCK and CoQ10 significantly scavenged DPPH and nitric oxide radicals in a concentration-dependent manner and demonstrated a better ferricreducing antioxidant potential. PCK exhibited a high DPPH radical scavenging ability with the lowest IC50 value of 54.05 µg/mL while CoQ10 exhibited higher reducing power with the IC50 value of 82.14 µg/mL.Both were also found to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme activity. In addition, PCK and CoQ10 significantly (p<0.05) prevented lipid peroxidation, modulated the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) pores and caused no significant release of cytochrome c. However, CoQ10 showed a mild inductive effect on mPT pores at higher concentrations. PCK and CoQ10 also increased mitochondrial ATPase activity. The results of this study suggest that both PCK and CoQ10 may be helpful in the treatment of diseases such as neurological disorders where excessive apoptosis is associated with excessive tissue degradation.",

      "abstract": "Background Hypertension and insulin resistance (IR) often coexist, significantly increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. IR plays a key role in metabolic syndrome, promoting endothelial dysfunction and impairing glucose metabolism. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are commonly prescribed for hypertension, but their differential effects on insulin sensitivity and diabetes risk remain unclear. This study compares the effects of losartan potassium (LP) (ARBs) and benazepril (ACEIs) on blood pressure control, insulin sensitivity, and metabolic parameters in hypertensive patients with IR. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted from September 2023 to September 2024 at Khyber Teaching Hospital, Peshawar and Lahore Medical and Dental College, Lahore. A total of 364 hypertensive patients with IR were included. Based on physician-prescribed treatment, patients were categorized into two groups: Group A received benazepril (10 mg/day), and Group B received LP (50 mg/day). Primary outcomes included blood pressure control, Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) scores, fasting glucose, and lipid profiles, measured at baseline and regular follow-ups over 12 months. Patient adherence was monitored through self-reports and prescription refill checks. Missing data were handled using multiple imputations. Statistical analyses included independent t-tests, paired t-tests, repeated-measures ANOVA, and multivariate regression models, with a significance level set at p < 0.05. Results Both treatments significantly reduced blood pressure, but LP demonstrated greater efficacy, with superior reductions in systolic (26.4 mmHg vs. 24.7 mmHg) and diastolic (15.3 mmHg vs. 13.6 mmHg) readings (p < 0.05). HOMA-IR scores improved more in the losartan group (1.7 vs. 1.4; p = 0.02), along with a greater decrease in fasting glucose, suggesting a potential protective effect against diabetes development. Lipid profile improvements were comparable between groups. Adherence rates were similar, with a dropout rate of 8.2% and no major adverse events. Conclusions LP was more effective than benazepril in lowering blood pressure and improving insulin sensitivity, which may contribute to a lower diabetes risk in hypertensive patients with IR. A randomized controlled trial with longer follow-up is recommended to confirm these findings and assess long-term metabolic outcomes."

      "abstract": "Inflammatory diseases burden the human body and their pathogenesis remains unclear. Macrophages, with plasticity to polarize into M1/M2 phenotypes, play crucial roles in inflammation. The impact of diverse ion channels on macrophage functions and their underlying mechanisms still requires further investigation. In this research, we observed that the expression magnitudes of some ion channels increased under the stimulation of LPS by transcriptomics analysis. Among them, KCNG3 has drawn our attention as it represents a potassium channel subunit with an undefined role in macrophages. To investigate its role, we knocked down KCNG3, resulting in an enhancement of phagocytosis, bactericidal ability, and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby facilitating M1 polarization. Knockdown of KCNG3 led to an increase in potassium ion efflux, an effect that was recapitulated under low potassium conditions, which in turn activated ASK1 and promoted M1 polarization. Through administering inhibitors NQDI-1, ASK1 was blocked and reversed the M1 phenotype caused by KCNG3 knockdown. In summary, KCNG3 regulates macrophage polarization via potassium ion flux and ASK1, offering potential for inflammatory disease treatment."

      "abstract": "AIM: Potassium bromate (KBrO3) is a colorless, odorless substance used as a food additive. It causes multiple organ damage and neurotoxicity. Morin is a flavonoid from the Moraceae family known to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiapoptotic, antiautophagic, and neuroprotective properties. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of Morin against KBrO3-induced brain damage. METHODS: 62 mg/kg KBrO3 and 50-100 mg/kg Morin were administered to 35 male rats by oral gavage daily for 14 days. Various analyses were performed using molecular, biochemical, and histological methods. RESULTS: The analyses results showed that KBrO3 application decreased antioxidant markers and raised lipid peroxidation in the brain tissue. The KBrO3 application triggered apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and inflammation. Morin treatment increased enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant levels and decreased lipid peroxidation. In addition, Morin alleviated KBrO3-induced apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and inflammation in the brain tissue. The histopathological analysis revealed an increase in degenerative changes, as well as pyknotic changes and vacuolization in cells, in neurons in the KBrO3 group. Increased hyperemia and congestion were detected in the meninges and vessels in the cerebral cortex. CONCLUSION: KBrO3 application caused toxicity in the brain tissue and impaired tissue integrity, whereas Morin treatment alleviated KBrO3-induced toxicity."

      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is devastating motor disorders accompanied by cognitive impairments. Dalfampridine (Dal), was approved for treating MS via blocking voltage-gated potassium channel (Kv). Kv1.3 is one of Dals' targets that showed insults to cognitive function in preclinical and clinical cases. Yet, there is no study that has assessed the potentiality of Dal on Kv1.3-induced cognitive impairment in MS. Thus, the aim of the present study is to reveal the procognitive influence of Dal in the MS animal model. Mice were randomly assigned into four groups. Saline was administered to group 1, conversely groups 2, 3, and 4 received 2 shots of rat spinal cord emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant. Group 3 received Dal (10 μg/mouse; p. o), while group 4 received Wortmannin (0.1 μg/mouse; i. c.v), a selective phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) inhibitor, before Dal administration. After 14 days, Dal alleviated motor deficits in the open field arena and rotarod with cognitive restoration in the novel object recognition task. These were accompanied by the reversal of hippocampal neuronal loss and demyelination in corpus callosum. Additionally, Dal inhibited Kv1.3 that enhanced survival signaling, viz; PI3K/Akt. Such activation abates neuroinflammatory markers, glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β) and nuclear factor-κB levels with subsequent enhancement of BDNF. All these amendments were reversed by Wortmannin pre-administration. In conclusion, this study declares that blockade of Kv1.3 and modulation of PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β/BDNF axis with Dal could be proposed as a promising neuroprotective and memory-enhancing treatment in MS."

Optical analysis confirmed wax removal, showing a 20 % drop in whiteness and 144 % higher opacity in wax-containing films. Thermal analysis revealed a 35 % lower wax melting enthalpy and 28 % less mass loss in treated films. FTIR spectra showed reduced ester CO peak intensity (1735 cm-1), confirming hydrolysis. Post-treatment, the solution's particle size grew to 2138 nm, zeta potential fell to 20.4 mV, and surface tension dropped to 40.94 mN/m. Microscopy revealed increased particle aggregation with wax-containing films. These results demonstrate the potassium carbonate-olive oil solution's effectiveness in wax removal from gelatin film surfaces through hydrolysis, emulsification, and solubilization mechanisms."

      "abstract": "Kv3.3 potassium channels are highly expressed in cerebellar Purkinje neurons and contribute to the ability of these neurons to fire at high rates. In addition to their role in regulating excitability, Kv3.3 channels form a complex with several cytoplasmic proteins, including Hax-1, Arp2/3, Rac1, and TBK1. This stimulates the nucleation of actin filaments under the plasma membrane. Using biochemical and confocal laser scanning microscopy techniques, we have found that the Kv3.3 channel binds and colocalizes with Plekhg4, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that regulates Rac1 activity, in Purkinje neurons and in Kv3.3-expressing auditory brainstem neurons. In addition to binding Kv3.3, Plekhg4 immunoreactivity is distributed uniformly in the cytoplasm of these cells, as well as in CHO cells expressing wild-type Kv3.3. The Kv3.3-G592R mutation differs from wild-type channels in that it fails to trigger actin nucleation, constitutively activates Tank-Binding Kinase-1 (TBK1), and, in humans, leads to spinocerebellar ataxia. We find that Plekhg4 forms cytoplasmic aggregates in the cells expressing Kv3.3-G592R, and that the formation of these aggregates is further enhanced by depolarization of the plasma membrane. Pharmacological inhibition of TBK1 reduces the number of Plekhg4 aggregates in Kv3.3-G592R-expressing cells. These results suggest that Purkinje cell activity, mediated by Kv3.3 channels, may regulate Pelkhg4 aggregation and provide a potential new therapeutic approach for the treatment of spinocerebellar ataxias.",

AIM: To assess the efficacy and safety of high-dose dual therapy (HDDT) utilizing various highly potent antisecretory medications, thereby providing additional clinical guidance for H. pylori eradication. METHODS: The study population comprised untreated H. pylori patients from three medical centers in central China. From February 10, 2024 to March 31, 2024, 439 subjects were randomly allocated to either the esomeprazole-amoxicillin (EA) or esomeprazole-amoxicillin-clarithromycin-bismuth (B-quadruple) group. Subsequently, from April 1, 2024 to May 10, 2024, 367 subjects were randomly assigned to either the vonoprazan-amoxicillin (VA) or vonoprazan-amoxicillin-clarithromycin (VAC) group. The study recorded treatment efficacy, adverse events, compliance, symptom alleviation, and associated costs. RESULTS: EA-dual demonstrated non-inferiority to B-quadruple regimen in modified intention-to-treat (mITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses (P < 0.025). However, the eradication rate of EA was lower than that of the B-quadruple group [70.59% vs 83.49%, 92.86% vs 98.38%, 93.94% vs 98.38%, intention-to-treat (ITT), mITT, PP respectively, P < 0.05]. In ITT, mITT, and PP analyses, VA-dual was non-inferior to VAC treatment (84.15% vs 83.15%, 96.25% vs 92.73%, 96.75% vs 93.75%, P < 0.025). No significant differences were observed in adverse events, compliance, and symptom relief between groups. VA exhibited the lowest cost. Antibiotic use within 2 years, poor compliance, and suburban residence were associated with reduced eradication efficacy (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The HDDT based on vonoprazan demonstrated non-inferiority to the VAC triple regimen, suggesting its potential as a recommended first-line treatment for H. pylori eradication. While B-quadruple therapy showed better eradication rate than EA therapy, the latter proved non-inferior in mITT and PP analyses. Notably, antibiotic use within the preceding two years, adherence to treatment protocols, and patient residence emerged as critical factors influencing eradication success.",

      "abstract": "Formaldehyde (FA) is a carcinogenic oxygenated volatile organic compound and a key constituent of indoor air pollution. Photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) is a promising strategy for managing FA in indoor environments. Here, the PCO of FA in indoor air has been investigated by modifying TiO2 with KOH (KOH/TiO2: expressed as KT-x, where x = the molar concentration of KOH from 0.1-2 m). The KOH treatment achieves superior FA removal performance of KT-0.1 over TiO2 (e.g., space-time yield: 1.78E-03 versus 9.91E-04 molecules photon-1 mg-1 and dynamic clean air delivery rate: 10 versus 5.43 L mg-1 min-1). Such differences in photocatalytic activity reflect an enhancement in charge separation, molecular oxygen activation (on the photocatalyst surface), and electron mobility facilitated by the presence of surface hydroxyl groups and potassium on the TiO2 surface. On the KT-x surface, the PCO of FA proceeds through several reactive intermediates (e.g., formate and dioxymethylene). According to density functional theory, the PCO of FA by KT-x is promoted by the synergistic combination of oxygen vacancies and potassium impurities on the TiO2 surface. This research offers valuable insights into the development of cost-effective photocatalysts with enhanced PCO performance."

      "abstract": "Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a significant adverse event with unclear mechanisms and limited treatment alternatives. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of two alkalizing agents, a mixture of potassium citrate and sodium citrate (K/Na citrate) or sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), in preventing and treating paclitaxel (PTX)-induced mechanical allodynia in rodents. The results from rodent models demonstrated that repeated prophylactic administration of K/Na citrate or NaHCO3 could inhibit the development of PTX-induced mechanical allodynia. Moreover, K/Na citrate was effective in preventing the PTX-induced exacerbation of mechanical allodynia, even when treatment was initiated immediately after the onset of allodynia. K/Na citrate also reduced the levels of the plasma complement component anaphylatoxin C3a in a PTX-induced CIPN rat model. Complement activation, resulting in the production of C3a, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of this model. Additionally, pretreatment with Na citrate significantly prevented the reduction in neurite outgrowth caused by PTX. Furthermore, K/Na citrate inhibited spontaneous and mechanical stimuli-induced firing in spinal dorsal horn neurons. These findings indicate that K/Na citrate may regulate the development of PTX-induced mechanical allodynia by modulating complement activation and providing neuroprotection against PTX-induced peripheral nerve injury. This study implies that alkalization could help prevent PTX-induced peripheral neuropathy and mitigate its exacerbation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sweet cherry is highly valued around the world for its sensory qualities. Bioactive properties play significant roles in sweet cherry quality and consumer acceptance due to its health benefits. Plant nutrition through balanced fertilizer application helps in abiotic stresses mitigation, enhancing the biosynthesis of bioactive substances. For three consecutive years, magnesium (Mg) and potassium (K) were applied as foliar sprays to sweet cherry trees of the Burlat cultivar, with the aim to improve phytochemical composition. Fruits from each treatment were harvested at the commercial ripening stage to evaluate cherry bioactive composition and antioxidant activity. RESULTS: Overall, the phytochemical composition and antioxidant activity increased over the three trial years, reaching their highest values in 2021, highlighting the effects of continuous fertilization with Mg and K. The Mg treatments (especially Mg250 in 2019 and Mg125 in 2020) enhanced the phytochemical composition of sweet cherries by increasing total phenolics, flavonoids, ortho-diphenols, and anthocyanin contents, as well as boosting antioxidant activity. In contrast, K treatments (mainly K50) led to a decrease in all bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity. The levels of individual phenolic compounds varied across treatments; however, catechin, epicatechin, chlorogenic acid, and quercetin-3-O-rutinoside contents declined over the 3 years, while neochlorogenic acid and cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside levels increased, stabilizing in 2020 and 2021. CONCLUSIONS: These findings offer valuable insights for enhancing sweet cherry bioactive properties. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry."

      "abstract": "Sludge dewatering is a critical phase in sludge treatment and disposal, significantly impacting storage, transportation, and subsequent handling. This study introduces an innovative approach combining potassium ferrate (PF) oxidation and polyacrylamide (PAM) flocculation to synergistically enhance sludge dewatering efficiency. PF disrupts EPS and releases bound water, while PAM restores floc structure, addressing the limitations of standalone oxidation. Initial PF conditioning significantly reduced sludge water content (Wc) to 75.18 %, attributed to the oxidative breakdown of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and the release of bound water. However, higher PF doses increased specific filtration resistance (SFR) and capillary suction time (CST), indicating deteriorated filterability. The subsequent addition of PAM mitigated these issues, further reducing Wc to 73.64 %, SFR from 12.75 × 1012 m/kg to 3.62 × 1012 m/kg, and reduced CST from 88.95 s to 32.3 s, demonstrating marked improvements in dewatering performance. Characterization studies revealed the underlying mechanisms: PF-induced sludge fragmentation and EPS degradation, followed by PAM-mediated re-flocculation and structural reorganization. Further, applying XDLVO theory and Flory-Huggins lattice theory revealed changes in the sludge's surface hydrophilicity and the system's chemical potential, improving SFR and enhancing dewatering efficiency while reducing moisture content. This investigation not only offers an innovative dewatering approach but also underpins the mechanism of improved dewaterability.",

      "abstract": "The dietary sodium-to-potassium ratio is positively correlated with blood pressure, and understanding this relationship is crucial for improving hypertension treatment. Moreover, few studies have examined these effects in both sexes. In this study, we aimed to investigate how supplementing (1.41% K+; HK) or depleting (DK) dietary potassium affects the development of salt-sensitive (SS) hypertension in male and female Dahl SS rats. Potassium supplementation attenuated blood pressure during 5 weeks of high salt (4% NaCl) diet in male but not in female rats. In contrast, potassium-deficient diet prevented the development of SS hypertension in both sexes, though this effect is unlikely to be protective. Both males and females on the DK diet were hypokalemic, had diminished heart rates, reduced weight gain, and females experienced high mortality. Males and females on the DK diet excreted less urinary sodium, but only females had elevated plasma sodium. Additionally, male and female DK-fed rats showed a decrease in multiple metabolites from the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. RNA-Sequencing of kidney cortical tissue revealed a number of genes that may underlie the sex-specific differences in phenotype. Analysis of renal ion channel and transporter expression revealed significant increases in basolateral inwardly rectifying potassium channels in DK rats. Male rats supplemented with potassium exhibited a decreased number and size of WNK4 puncta, whereas in potassium-supplemented females, there was no difference in puncta count and an increase in puncta size. Our data indicates there are sex-dependent differences in response to dietary potassium and that the distal nephron compensates for severe potassium deficiency."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In infants with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the management of nutrition and growth is highly challenging, particularly compared to older children. Management of hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia is difficult, and incorporating potassium and phosphate binders directly in formulas could be beneficial, as it avoids direct ingestion of resins by infants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a study using Gallia® standard first-stage infant formula and Pregestimil®. We added either carbonate sevelamer (Renvela®, 200, 400 or 800 mg) or polystyrene sulfonate (Resikali®, 2000, 4000 or 8000 mg) to 90 ml of formula. Additionally, we evaluated the combined use of the resins with Gallia® by adding in 90 mL 200 mg/2000 mg, 400 mg/4000 mg, and 200 mg/4000 mg of Renvela® and Resikali®, respectively. The Milk was decanted for 10 minutes, and the resulting supernatants were weighted and analyzed for osmolality and pH. Sodium, potassium, chlore, bicarbonate, magnesium, glucose, calcium, phosphate, protein, cholesterol, triglycerides, iron, folate, vitamin B12 levels were measured after centrifugation. RESULTS: With polystyrene sulfonate, potassium levels in milk decreased in a dose-dependent manner, by 36%, 52% and 68%, respectively. Polystyrene sulfonate also reduced magnesium levels and increased both calcium concentration (from 9.7 to 21 mmol/L) and osmolality (from 359 to 423 mOsm/kg). No significant effect on phosphate was observed. Sevelamer decreased both calcium and phosphate concentrations in a dose-dependent manner, by 14%, 26% and 29%, and by 24%, 36% and 40%, respectively. Sevelamer also increased pH from 6.9 to 9.1, and decreased folate levels by 32%, 66% and 81% respectively, from 465 to 88 mmol/L. The combined use of sevelamer and polystyrene sulfonate results in decreased levels of potassium (by 45%, 59% and 59%, respectively), phosphate (by 38%, 39% and 36%, respectively), and folate, albeit with a slighter increase in pH. Osmolality remained unchanged and no other relevant differences were observed. CONCLUSION: Pretreating formulas with resins is a reproducible and straightforward method when specific diets for CKD are unavailable. However, it is important to keep in mind that resins may impact the overall composition (osmolality) and the concentration of other nutrients (folates).",

      "abstract": "ObjectivesThis study aimed to determine the effect of inhaled salbutamol on blood potassium concentrations in normokalemic cats, evaluate whether effects are dose dependent and assess whether it affects heart rate and blood glucose concentrations.MethodsThe study was a prospective, open-label, two-way crossover trial. A total of 11 healthy cats were randomly assigned to two groups: one received a low dose of 100 µg salbutamol (Low group) and the other a high dose of 200 µg (High group). After a washout period of 15-21 days, the Low group received the high dose and the High group received the low dose. Blood potassium and glucose concentrations and heart rates were measured at baseline and 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 mins after salbutamol administration.ResultsPotassium concentrations significantly decreased over time after the administration of salbutamol in both groups (P <0.001). Salbutamol dose (µg/kg) and dose-time interaction had no significant effect on potassium concentration (P = 0.082 and P = 0.54, respectively). In the High group, mean potassium concentrations were significantly lower at 30-150 mins after salbutamol administration compared with baseline (P <0.011), and the mean decrease in potassium concentration from baseline to nadir was -0.69 ± 0.17 mmol/l. In the Low group, mean potassium concentrations were lower at 20-90 mins after salbutamol administration; however, these differences were not statistically significant (P >0.05). The administration of salbutamol did not appear to affect heart rate and blood glucose.Conclusions and relevanceIn healthy cats, salbutamol administration led to a small and variable, non-dose-dependent decrease in potassium levels, suggesting that individual susceptibilities may affect the response to the potassium-lowering effects of salbutamol. The doses used in this study seemed safe. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal dosage of salbutamol and its effect on hyperkalemic cats.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is limited knowledge regarding effective strategies, including information and communication technology (ICT)-based interventions, to reduce sodium intake and increase potassium intake in healthy individuals. METHODS: We conducted a three-month randomized controlled trial involving healthy adult employees with spot urine sodium-to-potassium ratios (spot UNa/UK) ≥4.0 or estimated 24-hour salt intake ≥10g. Estimated 24-hour UNa and UK were calculated using the Tanaka formula. Participants were assigned to one of four groups: (1) online education, where participants monitored their spot UNa/UK and received feedback from dieticians (n=84); (2) messaging, with similar self-monitoring and dietician messages (n=84); (3) self-learning, provided with an educational leaflet (n=87); and (4) a control group (n=87). The primary outcome was the change in spot UNa/UK ratios, and secondary outcomes included changes in estimated 24-hour UNa and UK. The trial protocol specified a hierarchical order for testing the interventions, anticipating the highest efficacy in the online education group. RESULTS: After the intervention, the online education group showed a decrease in spot UNa/UK ratios (mean -0.9 [95% CI -1.8 to 0.0], p=0.052) compared to the control group. The increase in estimated 24-hour UK excretion was larger in the online education compared to control group (mean +2.5 mmol/day [95% CI -0.3 to 5.3], p=0.085). The difference in estimated 24-hour UNa excretion between the online education and control groups was -4.3 mmol/day (95% CI -15.5 to 6.9, p=0.45). CONCLUSIONS: Combining self-monitoring of sodium and potassium intake with ICT-based interventions, including online nutritional education, was associated with a modest reduction in the estimated ratios of sodium and potassium intake in healthy individuals."

In response to the need for home monitoring and emergency care, point-of-care diagnostic technologies based on microsystems have emerged, nevertheless they remain limited in portability and speed for direct in whole blood samples measurement. To enable direct blood detection of potassium and creatinine for effective CKD management, this study presents a novel on-chip self-driven dual-channel optical microsensor designed for real-time monitoring of potassium and creatinine levels in whole blood. Utilizing 3D printing technology to design and fabricate microstructures, and integrating microchannels with a filtration layer, this microsensor requires only 10 μL of blood for single-pass sample filtration and dual-parameter detection. A novel passive blood sample pumping method is proposed, utilizing internal and external pressure differentials along with internal hydrophilic properties to facilitate sample flow into the detection chambers. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photodiodes, positioned on either side of the detection chamber, are employed to measure the concentrations of blood indicators. The detection results can be instantly handheld read and uploaded to the cloud via intelligent terminal, enabling seamless follow-up diagnostics and treatment. Through multiple rounds of testing on animal serum samples, whole blood samples, and real porcine blood samples, this microsensor demonstrated excellent linearity and accuracy. This innovative microsensor, designed for direct testing from a minimal volume of whole blood, holds significant potential for improving CKD management, offering a portable, reliable alternative for preoperative diagnostics and home-based chronic disease monitoring.",

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the mainstay of treatment for GERD, but have demonstrated a limited effectiveness for extraesophageal symptoms and signs in several meta-analyses. Potassium-competitive acid blockers (P-CABs) offer more rapid and sustained acid inhibition than PPIs; therefore, P-CABs may have the potential to be at least as good or superior to PPIs in relieving extraesophageal symptoms and signs of GERD. To date, there have been 4 prospective randomized trials demonstrating similar efficacy of P-CABs to PPIs in the treatment of extraesophageal symptoms and signs, but more rapid and greater efficacy in patients with severe symptoms. Therefore, P-CABs appear to have a treatment role in extraesophageal symptoms and signs of GERD. However, considering that P-CABs are not superior to PPIs, large-scale, multi-center studies with double dose P-CABs over a prolonged period of time may elucidate a subgroup of patients in whom P-CABs are beneficial in ameliorating extraesophageal symptoms and signs."

      "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) remains a common cause of preventable death in low-resource settings because of cost and lack of dialysis access. AKI occurs in 24-59% of children with severe malaria, and when severe malaria-associated acute kidney injury (SM-AKI) is complicated by hyperkalemia, mortality approaches 40%. Treatment of these children with severe anemia becomes challenging as packed red blood cells (pRBCs) have high potassium (K+) loads. We describe a protocol using the novel manual single-lumen alternating microbatch (mSLAMB) dialysis system to deplete pRBCs of K+, hypothesizing that this system can decrease K+ >80% in 20 minutes. Herein, we ran pRBC aliquots through the mSLAMB system using diffusive clearance. Three cycles were completed in each of four experiments. K+ was measured at baseline and after every cycle to calculate K+ reduction. Active ultrafiltration was performed to control net volumes, assessed as percentage of blood volume reduction and hematocrit rise. We reduced K+ in pRBC aliquots by a median of 93.2% (interquartile range [IQR], 89.9-95.1) in a median of 20.5 minutes (IQR, 17.8-23.1) per experiment. Greatest median K+ reduction occurred in cycle 1 (80.9%; IQR, 80.8-80.9), with minimal additional clearance achieved by cycle 3. Median hematocrit rise at experiment conclusion was 2.5% (IQR, 1.8-3.3). We conclude that mSLAMB dialysis consistently and effectively removed >80% of K+ from pRBCs in just over 20 minutes and facilitated volume control. Further studies are assessing transfusion risks in children with SM-AKI and hyperkalemia as this technique may allow for safer resuscitation."

Potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB) is a novel class of acid suppressants, providing more acid stability, rapid onset of action, less variability with CYP2C19 polymorphisms, and longer duration of action than PPI. DESIGN: The PROTECT-HBR trial is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group clinical trial. Approximately 3320 patients with known cardiac or vascular disease receiving antithrombotic drugs (either antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents) and who are at high risk of GI bleeding will be randomized to P-CAB (tegoprazan 50mg once daily) or PPI (rabeprazole 20mg once daily) for up to 12 months. The primary endpoint is a composite outcome of upper GI clinical events, including overt or occult GI bleeding, symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers or erosions, obstruction, or perforation, at 12 months. Secondary endpoints also included cardiovascular events and safety outcomes. RESULTS: As of December 2024, approximately 1460 patients were enrolled from 32 participating sites in South Korea. The complete enrollment is anticipated at the mid- or late-term of 2025, and the primary results will be available by 2027. CONCLUSION: PROTECT-HBR is a large-scale, multicenter, clinical trial, which will provide a pivotal comparison of the efficacy and safety of novel P-CAB, tegoprazan with those of PPI, rabeprazole in patients with documented cardiac or vascular disease receiving chronic antithrombotic drugs and at high risk of GI bleeding.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This single-arm prospective interventional study evaluated the effectiveness of silver-fluoride combined with potassium-iodide (AgF+KI; Riva Star Aqua, SDI) in decreasing hypersensitivity after its application on permanent molars affected by molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH Treatment Need Index [TNI] 3 and 4) immediately (15 minutes) and after 3 months. METHOD AND MATERIALS: In total, 22 children with 53 hypersensitive MIH-affected permanent molars (MIH TNI 3 or 4) underwent AgF+KI application after isolation with cotton rolls. Teeth included had no prior in-office desensitizing agents or sealants within 1 month before recruitment. Hypersensitivity was assessed using a 1-second air blast stimulus at three intervals: baseline, 15 minutes, and 3 months posttreatment (blinded). The response to the air-stimulus was quantified using the Schiff Cold Air Sensitivity Scale (SCASS), and teeth with grades 2 and 3 only were included. Statistical analysis involved the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Friedman test. RESULTS: The reported mean SCASS scores declined significantly from 2.5 (± 0.5) at baseline to 1.2 (± 0.9) after 15 minutes and 1.0 (± 1.0) after 3 months (n = 20 patients, n = 49 molars). Molars with SCASS 2 had a statistically significantly lower mean hypersensitivity score (from n = 26 to n = 24) compared to SCASS 3 teeth (from n = 27 to n = 19) at the subsequent posttreatment evaluation. However, the percentage reduction from baseline was not significant. Additionally, the reduction in hypersensitivity after AgF+KI application was almost identical for treated (desensitizing agent >1 month prior enrolment) and untreated molars. CONCLUSION: AgF+KI is an effective and simple desensitizer providing instant and mid-term relief in schoolchildren with hypersensitive MIH-molars.",

AIM: To evaluate the 4-week healing rate and safety of four linaprazan glurate dosing regimens in patients with erosive oesophagitis. METHODS: This double-blind, dose-finding study compared linaprazan glurate to lansoprazole. We included patients with endoscopically confirmed erosive oesophagitis (validated by a central review board) if they had Los Angeles (LA) grade C/D or LA grade A/B with partial response to at least 8 weeks of proton pump inhibitor therapy. Patients were randomised to 4 weeks of linaprazan glurate (25, 50, 75 or 100 mg twice daily) or lansoprazole (30 mg once daily), followed by 4 weeks of open-label lansoprazole. RESULTS: Of 248 patients randomised, central review confirmed erosive oesophagitis in 182 at screening endoscopy. Across all doses, linaprazan glurate achieved a 4-week healing rate of 71.1% in intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and 80.9% in per protocol (PP) analysis. In comparison, lansoprazole achieved healing rates of 60.6% (ITT) and 59.1% (PPS). The best performing linaprazan glurate dosing group outperformed lansoprazole by 28% in patients with LA grade A/B with partial PPI response and by more than 50% in patients with LA grade C/D. CONCLUSIONS: Linaprazan glurate demonstrated high 4-week healing rates compared to lansoprazole, with a good safety profile, supporting its further development.

      "abstract": "The swallowing reflex can be induced by peripheral stimulation of the larynx. Although previous studies have suggested that potassium ions exert facilitatory effects on the initiation of swallowing, little information is available on the mechanism underlying the potassium ion-evoked swallowing reflex. In this study, we evaluated the effects of potassium ions on peripheral afferent responses and the initiation of swallowing in conscious and anesthetized rats. Furthermore, the possible receptors involved were explored. The topical application of potassium chloride (KCl) significantly facilitated the swallowing reflex; these facilitatory effects were more prominent than those of distilled water (DW) or sodium chloride (NaCl). This phenomenon depended not on the concentrations of anions but on those of potassium ions. The potassium ion-induced response in the superior laryngeal nerve was most prominent after treatment with KCl, especially at the early stage. In chronic rats, without differences in licking behavior between DW, NaCl, and KCl, the intervals between swallows were the smallest during KCl-associated licking. Inward rectifier potassium channel (Kir)3.1- and Kir6.2-positive cells were detected in the nodose ganglion and vocal folds. The rate of expression of these molecules in immunoreactive cells was relatively high at 74.1% for Kir3.1 and 75.3% for Kir6.2. Kir3.1 and Kir6.2 blockers significantly decreased the number of KCl-induced swallows. Possible mechanisms underlying potassium ion-induced swallowing are discussed. Our findings suggest that Kir3.1 and Kir6.2 are involved in K ion-induced swallowing in rats.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Potassium ion-containing solutions readily induce responses in the superior laryngeal nerve and swallowing reflexes, particularly at an early stage. Inward rectifier potassium channel (Kir)3.1 and Kir6.2 channel-positive cells were detected in the nodose ganglion and vocal folds.

      "abstract": "Due to its unique structure and high capacity, bamboo-based hard carbon is often regarded as the most promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries. However, low sodium storage ability and poor Na+ transportation limit the development of bamboo-derived hard carbon. In this study, bamboo powder (BP) was pretreated with acidic potassium permanganate, in which the strong oxidizing properties introduced more oxygen-containing functional groups into the carbon skeleton. In addition, the two-step carbonization process facilitated the formation of hierarchical pore structures in the bamboo-based hard carbon (BP-A-P). Electrochemical measurements demonstrated that BP-A-P exhibited superior activity and stability. Under the current multiplication of 0.1 C, a reversible specific capacity of 338 mAh/g was achieved with a high first Coulombic efficiency of 81.7%. The excellent performance in sodium transportation and storage is mainly attributed to the rich micropores and abundant closed pores, which are induced by acidic potassium permanganate. Moreover, BP-A-P exhibits superior stability with a specific capacity maintained at 273 mAh/g after 100 cycles. Thus, acidic potassium permanganate treatment provides a new strategy for achieving complex hierarchical pores in bamboo-based hard carbon for high-performance sodium-ion batteries."

      "abstract": "Global climate change accelerates the challenges of agricultural drought spells, which are alarming for food security and can trigger food scarcity. Therefore, improving soil-water retention capability and crop drought resilience is becoming more important for sustainable agriculture. This study investigates the individual and combined effects of biochar and potassium on soil water retention, crop drought resilience, and related physio-biochemical mechanisms over a 50-day growth period in potted plants. Pine needle biochar (350 g/10 Kg of soil) was used during the soil preparation stage while potassium sulfate (100 mg/L) was applied as a foliar spray at the development (10 days) and vegetative stages (45 days) under three drought stress conditions: control (100% FC), mild (75% FC) and severe (40% FC). The results revealed that the combined application of biochar and potassium significantly increased morphological, physiological, and biochemical attributes of maize plants under drought stress, improving shoot fresh weight by 11%, 6%, and 5%, root fresh weight by 19%, 19%, and 23%, shoot length by 17%, 16%, and 19%, and root length by 21%, 30%, and 29% under control, mild, and severe drought stress conditions, respectively. Similarly, relative water contents (RWC) increased by 12%, 16%, and 20%, water potential (Ψ) increased by 26%, 22%, and 24%, osmotic potential (Ψs) increased by 100%, 59%, and 30%, and turgor potential (Ψp) increased by 28%, 35%, and 51% under combined treatment compared to control, mild, and severe drought stress. Additionally, biochar application with potassium foliar spray also improved membrane stability and integrity, cell wall loosening, membrane lipid peroxidation, and protein denaturing by decreasing electrolytic leakage by 35%, 28%, and 43%, proline by 30%, 27%, and 22%, hydrogen peroxidase by 47%, 45%, and 41%, and malondialdehyde contents by 24%, 20%, and 28% through activation of enzymatic (CAT, POD, SOD) and non-enzymatic (TSS, AsA, GSH) antioxidants. Furthermore, nutrient uptake was enhanced, with N increasing by 47%, 19%, and 45%, P by 64%, 82%, and 52%, and K by 24%, 42%, and 35% in shoots compared to normal, mild, and severe drought stress. These improvements mitigated cell dehydration, reduced transpiration inefficiency and delayed senescence, and ultimately supporting plant growth under drought stress. In conclusion, integrating biochar with potassium application effectively improves soil-water retention, alleviates oxidative stress and enhances drought tolerance in maize plants. This strategy can play a crucial role in sustainable agriculture by mitigating the adverse effects of drought stress and improving food security in drought-prone regions.",

METHODS: A series of cases showing the beneficial effects of urine alkalinization with potassium magnesium citrate, theobromine, zinc and vitamin A for the dissolution of uric acid stones and the treatment of other urological pathological conditions is presented. RESULTS: Alkalinization was effective in the dissolution of uric acid renal stones in various clinical conditions. Two cases of bilateral renal stone, four cases of staghorn renal stone, seven patients with unilateral renal stone, and five cases of ureteral stone were described. In this group the age ranged from 46 to 91 years, the M/F ratio was 7/11, the density of the stones ranged between 300 and 528. In most cases the urinary pH ranged from 5 to 5.5. Diabetes was observed in 4 cases, obesity in 4 cases and hyperuricemia in 7. Alkalinizing treatment achieved complete dissolution of the stone in 12 cases and almost complete or partial dissolution in other 6. A combination of potassium magnesium citrate, theobromine, zinc and vitamin A was used in all the cases.  In 4 cases the administration of allopurinol was associated. In one case with obstructive ureteral stones, stone dissolution was obtained with the combined administration of bicarbonate via nephrostomy and intravenous bicarbonate and oral treatment with citrates.  Stone dissolution of uric acid stones has also been described in some specific clinical conditions such as Crohn's disease with ileostomy, outcome of partial nephrectomy, cross-fused renal ectopia. Alkalinization was also used to prevent encrustation of a self-expanding metallic ureteral stent. Alkalinization has also been employed during the period of Mitomycin administration for the treatment of non-muscle infiltrating bladder tumors and for the treatment of overactive bladder. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of these case reports demonstrate that urinary alkalinization with frequent monitoring of urinary pH ​can be successfully employed in the non-surgical treatment of uric acid stones of different sizes in various locations.",

      "abstract": "The orchid cultivation is a significant sector in floriculture industry, and Zygopetalum maculatum is one of the most important orchid species of this industry due to its captivating fragrance and aesthetic appeal. Orchids, being epiphytic, are typically grown in soilless media, which lack essential macronutrients like nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), crucial for overall plant growth. Literature cited suggest several studies on combined effect of NPK on orchids, however, the studies on the impact of sole K application on morphological traits, and flower yield of Zygopetalum maculatum orchid have not been cited. Hence, this study was designed to explore the impact of K supplementation on morphological traits, floral yields, K uptake by the flowers, K dynamics in plant parts, and vase life of Zygopetalum maculatum flowers. The experiment was laid out in completely randomized design with six treatments of K application (i.e. T1 = No K in fertigation solution (K0), T2 = 10 mg K per L fertigation solution (K10), T3 = 25 mg K per L fertigation solution (K25), T4 = 50 mg K per L fertigation solution (K50), T5 = 75 mg K per L fertigation solution (K75) and T6 = 100 mg K per L fertigation solution (K100)), each treatment was replicated four times. The plants under the experimentation were treated with the nutrient solution weekly once. Results showed that K application enhanced water-extractable K content and dehydrogenase activity in the potting media. Morphological parameters such as bulb size, leaf number were significantly increased under the K100 treatment. Floral yields, including spike length, floret number per spike, floret dimension, and flower biomass, were also substantially higher with K supplementation. The K100 treatment produced 167% higher number of flower spike per plant with 44.4% higher number of significantly bigger sized florets per spike over K0 treatment. K content in leaves, bulbs, and roots significantly increased with K application. Flowering induced K reduction from back bulbs, leaves and roots. The post-flowering K reduction from different plant parts was minimized by K100 treatment. Partial regression analysis showed one unit K uptake by flowers caused, ~ 0.227, 0.564 and 0.317 unit K reduction from leaf, back bulb, and roots, respectively. Moreover, flowers from the K100 treatment exhibited an extended vase life compared to other treatments. Thus, it can be recommended that, 100 mg K L-1 fertigation solution should be applied weekly to sustainably improve Zygopetalum maculatum yields.",

      "abstract": "Potassium (K) is an essential macronutrient for plant growth. However, its bioavailability is low in acidic soils. Excessive K fertilization deteriorates the soil health, thus highlighting the need for sustainable alternatives. In previous studies, biochar application has been proven to be an effective amendment. Meanwhile, various potassium solubilizing bacteria (KSB) have been identified in soil that contributes to K bioavailability. However, their interaction under combine (co) application in acidic soil and its effects on K availability remain poorly understood. Therefore, a pot experiment was conducted to investigate the synergistic effect of co-application of rice straw biochar (BC) and KSB consortium on K availability to promote rapeseed growth. The treatment plan consisted of CK (control), recommended K fertilizer, 2 % BC (2 % w/w), KSB consortium, KSB consortium + 2 % BC (2 % w/w). Results of soil analysis conducted after crop maturity showed that co-application of 2 % BC and KSB consortium significantly improved the soil pH and organic matter contents by 0.62 and 12.52 units respectively, relative to CK. Meanwhile, soil available nutrients were greatly enhanced, as available K content increased by 52.1 %, which indicated that co-application of 2 % BC and KSB consortium could facilitate the better conversion of different forms of soil K and make it available for plant uptake. Furthermore, it also improved extracellular enzymatic activities (26.7-71.6 %) and soil bacterial community (Actinobacteriota and Firmicutes). These improvements greatly enhanced plant biomass (46 %) and yield (31 %). Overall results proved that co-application of 2 % BC and KSB effectively enhanced K availability for sustainable plant growth. Still, there is a need to identify the most efficient KSB strains that, in conjugation with BC, reduce the K fertilizer usage.",

      "abstract": "Up to half of individuals with depression do not respond to first-line treatments, possibly due to a lack of treatment interventions informed by neurobiology. A novel therapeutic approach for depression has recently emerged from translational work targeting aberrant activity of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons via modulation of the KCNQ voltage-gated potassium channels. In this study, individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) with elevated anhedonia were randomized to five weeks of the KCNQ channel opener, ezogabine (up to 900 mg/day) or placebo. Participants completed functional MRI during a monetary anticipation task and resting-state at baseline and at end-of-treatment. The clinical results were reported previously. Here, we examined VTA activity during monetary anticipation and resting-state functional connectivity between the VTA and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (mesocortical pathway) and ventral striatum (mesolimbic pathway) at baseline and end-of-treatment. Results indicated a significant drug-by-time interaction in VTA activation during anticipation (F(1,34) = 4.36, p = 0.044), where VTA activation was reduced from pre-to-post ezogabine, compared to placebo. Mesocortical functional connectivity was also higher in depressed participants at baseline compared to a healthy control group (t(56) = 2.68, p = 0.01) and associated with VTA hyper-activity during task-based functional MRI at baseline (R = 0.352, p = 0.033). Mesocortical connectivity was also reduced from pre-to-post ezogabine, compared to placebo (significant drug-by-time interaction, F(1,33) = 4.317, p = 0.046). Together this translational work is consistent with preclinical findings highlighting VTA hyper-activity in depression, and suggesting a mechanism of action for KCNQ channel openers in normalizing this hyper-activity in individuals with both depression and anhedonia."

Potassium-competitive acid blockers (P-CABs) have emerged as alternatives to PPIs, although their effectiveness in patients receiving DAPT have not been sufficiently explored. AIM: This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of PPIs and P-CABs in preventing cardiovascular events and gastrointestinal bleeding among patients receiving DAPT after coronary stent implantation. METHOD: A retrospective cohort design was employed using nationwide claim data from South Korea. The study included patients who received aspirin-clopidogrel DAPT with PPI or P-CAB for a minimum of 60 days. After applying propensity score matching (PSM) at a 1:1 ratio, survival analysis was conducted. The primary outcome was a composite of acute myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, revascularization, and in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes involved the individual components of the composite outcome and gastrointestinal bleeding. RESULTS: The initial cohort included 39,234 patients in the PPI group and 3,434 in the P-CAB group. After 1:1 PSM, 3,434 patients were included in each group. No statistically significant differences were observed between the PPI and P-CAB groups for the primary outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-1.07; p = 0.167) and gastrointestinal bleeding (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.76-2.42; p = 0.3). CONCLUSION: Both PPIs and P-CABs appear to be viable options for acid suppression in patients undergoing DAPT, with no significant differences in cardiovascular or gastrointestinal outcomes."

However, since the discovery of a new class of acid suppressants, potassium-competitive acid blockers (P-CABs), the desire for a therapeutic agent has continued and the clinical trials on P-CABs have been conducted. In this regard, we aimed to assess whether P-CABs are noninferior to PPIs in patients with GU in terms of efficacy. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Additionally, we used a new methodology of inference concept with the purpose of grouping between P-CABs and PPIs. Moreover, our quality management system was integrated throughout the research to ensure data accuracy. FINDINGS: We initially screened 438 studies and extracted 10 homogeneous GU RCTs with 6315 participants. The odds ratios (ORs) for the 4-week cure rate in Bayesian + frequentist NMA, tegoprazan 100 mg (OR = 4.14, 95% credible interval [CI] 0.56-26.3) and pantoprazole 40 mg (OR = 4.12, 95% CI 1.90-8.88) were the largest, respectively. The ORs for the 8-week cure rate in Bayesian + frequentist NMA, lansoprazole 30 mg (OR = 8.77, 95% credible interval [CI] 0.95-78.9) and lansoprazole 30 mg (OR = 7.91, 95% CI 2.60-24.03) was the largest, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the NMA reveal that the cure rates of P-CABs in cases of GU were not inferior to those of PPIs. As the inference by grouping PPIs and P-CABs, the results showed similar trends in terms of effectiveness between the two therapeutic classes."

Each concentration of PN was applied to a hemi-arch for 10 min, and then a 35% bleaching agent was applied. The participants underwent two sessions of bleaching with a one-week interval. TS was recorded using a questionnaire and a visual analog scale. RESULTS: According to McNemar's test, there was a significant reduction in the prevalence of TS in group A (p=0.013) and group B (p=0.000) across the time assessments. Fisher's Exact Test showed no significant difference between the control and treatment sides (p>0.05). There was a significant reduction in TS intensity for both groups (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The 10% and 35% PN were effective in reducing the prevalence and intensity of TS, as well as 5% PN, and the treatments did not affect color change.

Five patients with complex medical histories, large stone sizes, and diverse stone compositions were treated with this therapy, resulting in complete stone dissolution without the need for surgical intervention. The findings highlight the potential of this approach to effectively dissolve stones and prevent recurrence, particularly for patients deemed unsuitable for surgery. Despite its proven efficacy, the adoption of chemical management remains underutilized in Saudi Arabia. Incorporating potassium sodium hydrogen citrate into the standard treatment protocols could reduce dependence on invasive procedures, improve patient outcomes, and alleviate the burden on healthcare resources."

      "abstract": "Various methods have been explored to activate potassium permanganate (Mn(VII)) for the elimination of organic compounds, typically by generating highly-reactive manganese species (RMnS) or mediated by electron transfer process (ETP). However, the oxidation selectivity, transformation pathways, toxicity byproduct potential, and efficacy in complicated water matrices associated with RMnS and ETP have not been comprehensively evaluated and compared, which is important for selecting a fit-of-purpose mechanism for water remediation. This study selected Mn(VII)/graphite process and ultraviolet (UV)/Mn(VII) process as the model ETP-dominated system and RMnS-dominated system, respectively. RMnS demonstrated significantly higher degradation efficiency for bromophenols, with oxidation rate constants 2.69-6.28 times higher than ETP. The oxidation efficiency of RMnS could be enhance under alkaline condition, whereas the degradation efficiency of ETP is dependent on the combined effects of solution pH and pKa of compounds. Furthermore, RMnS exhibited a stronger dehalogenation capacity, enabling the almost complete release of bromide ions from bromophenols with the formation of non-brominated organic product. Correspondingly, the RMnS process obviously reduced the brominated disinfection byproducts formation potential (DBPFPs). Mass spectrometry results revealed that the ETP process tended to form more polymeric brominated dimer products during the oxidation of bromophenol, leading to more DBPFPs production. ETP process showed superior degradation efficiency in real water backgrounds due to robustness against complicated water matrices, and displayed lower energy and oxidant consumption. Findings of this study elucidated the efficiency and mechanistic differences between RMnS and ETP, providing guidance for selecting activation methods to enhance KMnO4-based water treatment process."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Whole-food plant-based diets (WFPBDs) are beneficial in managing hypertension in the general population but have not been well studied in chronic kidney disease (CKD), potentially due to concerns about hyperkalemia. We hypothesized that individuals with CKD 3 or 4 attending a 15-day WFPBD education program would achieve lower blood pressure compared to those who did not, without an increased risk of hyperkalemia. METHODS: This was a pilot trial of 40 subjects with mild-to-moderate CKD and hypertension but without diabetes or proteinuria from a single academic center. The subjects were randomized to the 15-day education program or the control group. The changes in blood pressure, serum potassium, and other anthropometric and biochemical values were assessed. RESULTS: Systolic blood pressure decreased from the baseline to day 15 in the intervention group by 8 mm Hg and increased in the control group by 2.7 mm Hg, although the difference in the blood pressure change did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.12). Diastolic blood pressure was not different between the two groups. Potassium changed by 0.01 mEq/L in the intervention group and -0.07 mEq/L in the control group (p = 0.52). The intervention subjects had significant decreases in body mass (-3.0 vs. -0.12 kg, p < 0.0001), total cholesterol (-39.4 vs. -5.0 mg/dL, p < 0.0001), low-density lipoprotein (-28.4 vs. -0.6 mg/dL, p < 0.0001), and high-density lipoprotein (-8.6 vs. -0.4 mg/dL, p = 0.006) compared to the controls. The changes in albumin and phosphorus were not different between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The subjects with mild-to-moderate CKD attending a 15-day WFPBD education program had a non-statistically significant reduction in systolic blood pressure without an increased risk of hyperkalemia compared to those who did not attend. The intervention subjects achieved significantly greater reductions in body mass and cholesterol without adverse effects on albumin or phosphorus. Larger and longer-duration trials using this approach in a diverse group of CKD patients are warranted.",

However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the excitability of these cells, and consequently itch sensation, are poorly understood. TWIK-related spinal cord K + channel (TRESK) is a background K + channel that modulates the resting membrane potential, action potential firing, and neuronal excitability, and it has been involved in somatosensation and pain transduction. Here, we demonstrate that this channel contributes to pruritic transduction and it is a potential target for treating chronic itch pathologies. TRESK channel coexpress with Mas-related G-protein-coupled receptor A3, MrgprC11 and MrgprD in mouse sensory neurons, and with MrgprX1 in human ones. Genetic ablation of TRESK enhances firing of MrgprA3-expressing pruriceptors and acute itch in response to intradermal injection of chloroquine, while the response to histamine, BAM8-22, or leukotriene C4 remains unaffected. TRESK deletion also exacerbates chronic itch in mouse models of allergic contact dermatitis, dry skin, and imiquimod-induced psoriasiform dermatitis, resulting in a significantly increased scratching behavior that develops earlier and is more robust. Moreover, pharmacologically enhancing TRESK function diminishes both acute and chronic itch in wild-type mice but not in TRESK knockout (KO) animals. In summary, our data indicate that TRESK plays a role in regulating the excitability of a subset of sensory neurons that mediate histaminergic-independent itch. Enhancing the channel function with specific activators represents a promising antipruritic therapeutic approach that can be combined with other compounds for the treatment of nonhistaminergic itch, which currently lack adequate treatment options."

      "abstract": "Hippocampal sclerosis, characterized by significant hippocampal neuronal loss, oxidative stress, glial cell proliferation, and inflammatory responses, constitutes a pivotal component in the pathogenesis of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Traditional treatment strategies, mainly involving anti-epileptic drugs, face challenges including ineffectiveness, drug tolerance, and adverse reactions, complicating management of the condition. Herein, we design and engineer ultrasmall potassium calcium hexacyanoferrate (III) nanoparticles, designated as KCaHNPs, which feature a broad spectrum of enzymatic activities analogous to superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, and glutathione peroxidase. KCaHNPs efficiently neutralize excessive reactive oxygen species, mitigate mitochondrial dysfunction, maintain neuronal integrity, and prevent apoptosis. Importantly, KCaHNPs significantly reduce neuronal damage, apoptosis, ferroptosis, and glial cells activation in TLE-afflicted rats, thereby improving spatial and short-term memory, and diminishing epileptic hyperexcitability. Prophylactic deployment of KCaHNPs markedly decreases the frequency and duration of seizures, extends the latency period before the onset of initial seizures, and enhances neural functions within the hippocampal CA3 area. Collectively, these findings underscore the potent therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy of KCaHNPs in mitigating TLE by bolstering cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative stress and inflammation. This innovative approach holds promise as a comprehensive and efficacious strategy for managing temporal lobe epilepsy and potentially other complex neurological disorders."

Increased potassium intake has been associated with antihypertensive and cardioprotective effects demonstrated by many studies, but its supplementation is infrequent in many countries and not frequently recommended by scientific societies. Hypertension is very common and a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, strokes, and death, but it is poorly controlled, especially in developing countries. The causes for this are multiple and one of them could be the low potassium supplementation or lack of it. A review of the literature revealed that potassium supplementation decreases blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, strokes, and death. However, its intake is low and not recommended by several societal blood pressure treatment guidelines with the worldwide potassium intake to be quite low. This is happening despite the fact that potassium supplementation is very easy through potassium salt supplements and from the intake of fruits and vegetables rich in potassium content. Therefore, potassium intake should be recommended by physicians to their hypertensive patients, since its benefits significantly outweigh its risks."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypokalemia is a frequently occurring electrolyte disorder in hospital patients and is often treated with intravenous (IV) potassium replacement. In Australia, most hospital departments use IV potassium replacement therapies, which are known anecdotally to cause pain. To our knowledge, there have been no studies on Australian clinicians' practices in managing IV potassium replacement. AIMS: To investigate the management of IV potassium infusions by clinical staff in a regional Local Health District in New South Wales, Australia. METHODS: An interprofessional team of clinicians was formed and utilised the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle. An online case-based survey was created to collect infusion management issues from clinicians' perspectives. The survey utilised a fictional case study with multiple-choice questions. It aimed to investigate clinicians' self-reported clinical practice behaviours when managing potassium infusions, which were analysed descriptively. Data from open-ended questions about managing potassium infusion pain were analysed using inductive content analysis. RESULTS: The study found that clinicians (n = 177) manage IV replacement, with two-thirds reporting multiple weekly instances. Clinicians observed that patients report pain during infusions. Factors such as potassium concentration (n = 130), patient anxiety (n = 118), peripheral administration (n = 109) and cannula sites in the lower arm (n = 102) were reported as pain risk factors. Clinicians reported using various strategies to manage infusion pain, including slowing the infusion, simple pain relievers, and topical applications. Severe potassium deficiency was a barrier to managing pain. Clinicians felt the management of pain to be challenging both clinically and ethically. Survey comments also suggest that IV potassium may be overused, presenting an opportunity for future improvement. CONCLUSION: The PDSA cycle structured the quality improvement initiative. This research explores how clinicians manage IV potassium infusions. Our findings uncover how frequently clinicians manage pain caused by IV potassium infusions, an area that is not well-documented.

      "abstract": "Multi-shelled hollow covalent organic framework nanospheres (MH-COFs) with at least two shells integrate the merits of the porous crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) matrix with the complex hollow architecture, which can motivate new functions for exceptional performance. However, the fabrication of MH-COFs is still uncultivated and remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we reported a facile template-free protocol for the general synthesis of different MH-COFs by controlling the simultaneous processes of surface crystallization and core etching of the crystalline-inhomogeneity nanospheres of COFs precursor. The crystalline-inhomogeneity solid covalent organic polymer nanospheres (COPs) with robust crystalline surface but vulnerable amorphous core were designed. Subsequently, an acetic acid aqueous solution treatment of crystalline-inhomogeneity COPs not only induced selective etching of the vulnerable cores but also promote the further crystallization of the surface layers, thereby producing hollow COFs. A further step-by-step expansion of seeded growth for inhomogeneous COP layers and then similar acid solution treatment can output the intriguing MH-COFs. An extraordinarily stable K-ion battery anode with high capacity was demonstrated with a MH-COFs/S nanocomposite fabricated by covalently bonding chain sulfur into the MH-COFs matrix. This work opened a simple but powerful avenue in designing complex hollow COFs architectures to boost their potential for applications."

We evaluated the effect of supplementing different feed additives to diets containing K2CO3 on feed intake, nutrient digestion and milk production of dairy cows. Eight peak lactation high yielding Holstein cows were used in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with 4 periods of 21 d (14 d for diet adaptation and 7 d for sampling and data collection). Treatments comprised control (a diet containing a rumen buffer with the active component of K2CO3 at 6% of dietary dry matter (DDM) and containing 10% K); yeast, the control diet supplemented with live Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast (0.06% of DDM); essential oils (EO), the control diet supplemented with essential oils (0.02% of DDM) and; peptides, the control diet supplemented with biogenic peptides (0.16% of DDM). Feed intake was greater (P < 0.001) in the yeast treatment (33.2 kg/d) compared to the others (30.9 to 32.1 kg/d). Dry matter and starch digestibilities were similar across the treatments. Cows that were supplemented with EO had a greater energy-corrected milk yield than control, and those supplemented with yeast and peptides were intermediate. Milk protein production was greater (P < 0.01) in EO and peptide treatments than in the control, with yeast treatment intermediate. In high-concentrate diets containing K2CO3, supplementing with yeast increased feed intake while supplementing wth essential oils increased energy-corrected milk yield, with small effects on milk protein yield."

      "abstract": "Environmental factors play an important role in anthocyanin biosynthesis, and potassium, an essential nutrient for blueberry growth, can act as an enzyme activator. However, few reports exist on the transcriptional and anthocyanin metabolic changes in blueberries regulated by potassium. The results indicated that potassium treatment significantly increased the contents of malvidin, petunidin, and delphinidin in blueberry fruits and accelerated early color development, particularly favoring the accumulation of darker pigments such as malvidin, petunidin, and delphinidin when applied at the young fruit stage. Transcriptome analysis identified 102 glucose metabolism-related genes and 12 differential potassium transport genes potentially involved in potassium-mediated anthocyanin synthesis and accumulation, with AKT1 and KUP potassium transporters being upregulated under potassium fertilization. In the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway, 13 genes, including UFGT, F3H, CHI, HCT, C12RT1, DFR, and F3'5'H, were closely linked to flavonoid and anthocyanin metabolite synthesis regulated by potassium. Furthermore, potassium treatment markedly enhanced the activities of key enzymes, F3H, F3'5'H, and UFGT, in the anthocyanin synthesis pathway of blueberry fruits. Overall, these findings elucidate the influence of potassium application timing on anthocyanin synthesis and provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms governing anthocyanin biosynthesis in blueberries.",

In this study, we aim to evaluate the effects of administering sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) complicated by hyperkalaemia. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A total of 80 patients with type 2 diabetes and hyperkalaemia will be included in the study and randomly stratified into two groups.After consent, both groups will enter an initiation phase, receiving 10 g of SZC, three times per day for 2 days. SZC administration (5 g once daily) will subsequently commence in group A, while dietary therapy will be initiated in group B by implementing a potassium-restricted diet. The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of normokalaemic (3.5 mEq/L≤serum potassium (sK)<5.0 mEq/L) participants at visit 7. The secondary endpoints are: (a) the proportion of normokalaemic participants (3.5 mEq/L≤sK<5.0 mEq/L) at visit 4 and (b) serum potassium levels at visit 7. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants prior to commencing the study.

This study aimed to assess the role of the glucose/potassium (Glu-K) ratio in predicting the severity and adverse outcomes of acute ALP poisoning. The current retrospective cohort study involved patients with acute ALP poisoning who were admitted to Tanta University Poison Control Center from June 2022 to June 2024. Sociodemographic and poisoning data, initial findings of clinical examination, Glu-K ratio, and calculation of Poisoning Severity Score (PSS), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), and PGI score were documented. Patients were categorized into two groups according to mortality outcome. Out of 206 acute ALP-poisoned patients, we recorded 67.5 % fatalities. The median value of the Glu-K ratio was significantly higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors (44.8 versus 28.9; p < 0.001). The Glu-K positively correlated with PSS, APACHE II, and PGI scores (p < 0.001). The APACHE II score exhibited the highest performance for predicting mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation (AUC=0.876 and 0.853, respectively). However, the Glu-K ratio conveyed a comparable discriminatory power with other scoring systems (PSS and PGI) for anticipating all unfavorable outcomes. Patients with a Glu-K ratio ≥ 37.07 had significantly decreased survival duration than patients with a Glu-K ratio < 37.07 (0.38 versus 3 days; p < 0.001). Therefore, the initial Glu-K ratio is an easily accessible routine biomarker for assessing poisoning severity and outcomes probability of ALP-poisoned patients, particularly with limited healthcare facilities."

Methods. We will perform systematic research in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHLE, and grey literature will be screened. We will screen RCTs on patients treated with SZC or patiromer in chronic hemodialysis, without sex or age restriction, which include the differences in serum potassium concentration, adverse events (AEs), and mortality as outcomes. Expected results. This systematic review is expected to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy and adverse effects of new potassium binders, compared to sodium polystyrene sulfonate or calcium polystyrene sulfonate or placebo, on serum potassium concentration, in a sample of hemodialysis patients. Furthermore, possible gaps in actual knowledge can be highlighted, suggesting new research. Conclusions. The present protocol for a systematic review will consider all existing evidence from published RCTs about the efficacy of HIF-PHIs on hemodialysis patients.",

BMP tests showed significant improvements in hydrolysis kinetics and methane yield. Continuous experiments validated these findings, with volatile solids destruction increasing from 33 % for raw paunch to 61 % for 12 % KOH pre-treated paunch. Methane yield was consistently enhanced with an increase of up to 150 % compared to raw paunch. Microbial analysis revealed a shift in dominant methanogens from Methanosaeta to Methanobacterium, in response to KOH pre-treatment. While the results highlight the potential of KOH pre-treatment to improve both degradability and methane recovery, challenges related to process stability were identified, emphasizing the need for further investigation to optimise operational conditions for full-scale applications.",

      "abstract": "This study explored key factors influencing TiO2 morphology using potassium titanate nanowires (KTNWs) as precursors. The pH of the hydrothermal solution was identified as critical in controlling TiO2 morphology. Different washing methods for precursors synthesized under alkaline conditions lead to varying pH environments in the subsequent hydrothermal solutions, thereby influencing the growth direction of TiO2 nuclei. Even a very slight pH change could cause a huge difference in the morphology of TiO2, by adjusting precursor washing methods, rod-like, cuboidal, and octahedral bipyramidal TiO2 nanocrystals were synthesized, the octahedral bipyramidal TiO2 exhibiting the smallest particle size. Acid treatment could stabilize the octahedral bipyramidal morphology of the TiO2 nanocrystal, and reduced particle size by nearly 86% than that of rod-like TiO2-R nanocrystal. Acid treated sample TiO2-R-H7 achieved the best photocatalytic activity, which was nearly 3 times than that of original TiO2. Adjusting (NH4)2CO3 morphology-controlling agent concentrations further regulated {001} facet exposure ratio to improve the photocatalytic activity, the TiO2-R-0.14 synthesized at 0.14 mmol per L (NH4)2CO3 showing about 2.6 times than that of original TiO2. However, excessive (NH4)2CO3 concentrations would reduce the photocatalytic activity due to increased particle size and fewer oxygen vacancies. This study provides insights into the growth mechanisms of TiO2 morphologies and highlights acid treatment as a strategy to reduce particle size and enhance photocatalytic activity, offering guidance for designing high-performance TiO2 based photocatalyst."

Materials and Methods: This prospective, comparative, clinical study recruited schoolchildren with at least one hypersensitive MIH molar with a Schiff cold air sensitivity score (SCASS) of 2 and 3. Caregivers in both groups (AgF + KI and GIC + glaze) answered a questionnaire (5-Point Likert Scale) regarding the perception of the treatment immediately (15 min post application) and in the 12 weeks follow-up. Children's behaviour during both applications was assessed using FBRS (Frankl Behaviour Rating Scale). Results: A total number of 47 children (n = 22 for AgF/KI and n = 25 for GIC) with a mean age of 8.6 ± 1.42 were recruited. A high proportion of the children in both arms (n = 40 out of 44; 90.1%) reported a reduction in hypersensitivity in the last 12 weeks. On average, children (n = 39; FBRS ≥ 3) in both groups showed positive behaviour, with a significantly more definitely positive behaviour in the GIC group (p < 0.05, independent student t-test). Caregiver satisfaction with both study procedures was high after immediate assessment (n = 19 out of 22, 86.4% for AgF/KI and n = 19 out of 25, 76.0% for GIC application) and in 12 weeks of follow-up (n = 17 out of 20, 85.0% for AgF/KI and n = 22 out of 24, 91.6% for GIC application). However, the taste AgF/KI is more frequently considered not acceptable for the child (n = 10; 45%) than smell (n = 2; 9%). Interestingly, there was a statistically significant difference in caregivers' preference toward alternative desensitisation treatment (tooth restoration coverage, desensitisation paste, stainless steel crown and fluoride varnish) in both treatment groups (p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). Conclusions: Both GIC and AgF/KI applications can be considered acceptable approaches to reduce hypersensitivity in permanent molars affected by MIH both immediately and in long-term follow-up for schoolchildren based on caregivers' assessments."

We aimed to develop a new prognostic model associated with PCRGs that can be used for prognosis and immunotherapy prediction in HCC patients. The transcriptional profiles and clinical data related to HCC were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Differentially expressed PCRGs were identified using the \"edgeR\" package. Prognostic model associated with PCRGs were constructed using univariate analysis, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and multivariate regression analysis. The prognostic value of the model was evaluated through Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Additionally, the tumor immune microenvironment was assessed using single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) and the CIBERSORT algorithm. Finally, potential drugs targeting signature genes were predicted. We successfully constructed a prognostic signature based on PCRGs, and the prognostic results were superior in the low-risk group. The nomogram demonstrated satisfactory predictive performance in estimating overall survival (OS) in HCC patients. The results of immune cell infiltration and predictions of immunotherapy response revealed that the low-risk group exhibited a more favorable response to immunotherapy. In addition, signature gene expression was significantly correlated with antitumor drug sensitivity. In conclusion, the characteristics of PCRGs serve as valuable tools for accurately assessing the prognosis and tumor microenvironment of HCC patients. Additionally, PCRGs markers can facilitate precision therapy in HCC management.",

In our previous study, potassium oxonate (PO), a uricase inhibitor commonly used for elevating uric acid in mice, unexpectedly showed remarkable inhibition of tumor growth when combined with anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1). Further research demonstrated that the combination of potassium oxonate and anti-PD-1 could reprogram the immune microenvironment. This study aimed to explore the anti-tumor effect of PO combined with anti-PD-1, and investigate the impact on the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). METHODS: We established a syngeneic mouse model of CRC and divided into groups of control group, single drugs group of PO and anti-PD-1, and the combination group. Use the HE staining, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and TUNEL staining of tumor issues to verify the anti-neoplasm of each group. We also tested the changes of TME through flow cytometry of spleen of mice in each group, as well as the IHC of cytokines. RESULTS: The co-therapy of PO and anti-PD-1 showed admirable anti-tumor effect compared with the control group and the single drug groups. The TME were tended to an environment beneficial for killing tumors by enhancing chemotactic factor release, increasing CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation, and decreasing the amount of regulatory T cells. Moreover, IFN-γ and IL-2 secretion were found to be enriched in the tumor TME. CONCLUSION: Our study indicated that combination of PO and anti-PD-1 could synergistically suppress CRC progression and altered the tumor microenvironment in favor of antitumor immune responses."

      "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to determine if there was a significant change in potassium levels with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor therapy in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). A co-primary objective was to evaluate which factors may predispose a patient to changes in potassium levels. DESIGN: Multicenter retrospective cohort chart review. DATA SOURCE: Study patients were identified through an electronic medical record-generated report if they had T2D and were prescribed an SGLT2 inhibitor from January 2013 to September 2019. PATIENTS: Patients were included if they had T2D, were receiving care at Advocate Medical Group, and were confirmed to have taken one of the four SGLT2 inhibitors available at the time of study approval, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, or ertugliflozin, for at least 7 days. Patients were excluded if they did not have a basic metabolic panel or comprehensive metabolic panel recorded 1 year prior to or 6 months after SGLT2 inhibitor therapy initiation. RESULTS: Data extraction from the electronic medical record identified 6425 patients receiving an SGLT2 inhibitor, of which 1926 met inclusion criteria. The SGLT2 inhibitor most prescribed was canagliflozin (43.7%), followed by empagliflozin (36.9%) and dapagliflozin (19.4%). Concomitant baseline medications were thiazide diuretics (27.5%); angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (72.1%); and/or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (27.2%). A statistically significant change in potassium levels was found with dapagliflozin (p = 0.018); albeit not clinically significant. No other statistically significant changes or patterns were identified. The overall mean change in serum potassium from baseline was 0.021 mmol/L within 3 months; 0.007 mmol/L from 3 to 5.9 months; -0.017 mmol/L within 6-12 months; and 0.004 mmol/L after more than 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: No clinically significant increase or decrease in potassium levels was observed upon initiation of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy in patients with T2D. This was consistent across background medication use and patient-specific factors. Baseline potassium should not be a factor in initiating SGLT2 inhibitor therapy, if clinically indicated, in patients with T2D.",

      "abstract": "We studied the effectiveness of different coagulants (0.15 M FeCl3, 0.40 M HCl, and 2.5% H3PO4) in separating key plant macronutrients (N as NH4+, P, and K) from swine manure into solid and liquid fractions for their sustainable use in agriculture. This study assesses how these coagulants impact nutrient recovery and separated fraction's characteristics, aiming to improve the solid-liquid separation process using biochar and zeolite. The FeCl3 treatment, biochar, and zeolite showed optimum nutrient recovery among the tested coagulants for solid (93% of total P) and liquid (90% and 50% of total NH4+ and K, respectively) phase separation of swine manure. Most macronutrients present in swine manure Ca (99%), Mg (76%), and P (71%) exist in the solid fraction, while NH4+ (100%) and K (72%) are predominantly present in the liquid fraction and their distribution changed under the influence of coagulating agents. Gibb's free energy (ΔG0) values of P (-19.7 kJ mol-1) and K (-5.31 kJ mol-1) were used to assess the applicability of flocculation followed by sedimentation process as opposed to the reverse one. Characterization of manure solids using E4/E6 ratio, FTIR, pH metric curve, and desorption with Mehlich-III solution (∼12% recycled of 93% separated P) suggest that P strongly complexed in the separated solid fraction, possibly through cation bridging and ligand-exchange reactions. Adsorption-desorption results indicate that the cation exchange was responsible for NH4+ (99%) and K (73%) recycling using zeolite. Inclusively, the study presents a proper combination of coagulant and physical processes to recover and recycle nutrients from swine manure effectively.",

      "abstract": "Prolonged exposure to Gαi/o receptor agonists such as opioids can lead to a sensitization of adenylyl cyclases (ACs), resulting in heterologous sensitization or cyclic AMP (cAMP) overshoot. The molecular consequences of cAMP overshoot are not well understood, but this adaptive response is suggested to play a critical role in the development of opioid tolerance and withdrawal. We found that genetic reduction of AC1 and simultaneous upregulation of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel subunits, SUR1 or Kir6.2, significantly attenuated morphine tolerance and reduced naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. In vitro models utilized an EPAC2-GFP-cAMP biosensor to investigate sensitization of adenylyl cyclase in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and HEKΔAC3/6 knockout cells. Acute application of DAMGO significantly decreased the cAMP signal from the EPAC2-GFP-cAMP biosensor, while chronic DAMGO administration resulted in enhanced cAMP production following AC stimulation. Inhibition of cAMP overshoot was observed with naloxone (NAL), pertussis toxin (PTX), and the neddylation inhibitor, MLN4924 (Pevonedistat), as well as co-expression of β-adrenergic receptor kinase C-terminus (β-ARKCT). After establishment of the AC1-EPAC sensitization in the in vitro models, we found that inhibition of AC1 or EPAC enhanced potassium channel activity after chronic morphine treatment, using a thallium-based assay in SH-SY5Y cells. Similar data were obtained in mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRG) after chronic morphine treatment. This study presents evidence for investigating further AC1 signaling as a target for opioid tolerance and withdrawal, by increasing EPAC activity and affecting potassium channels downstream of opioid receptors."

      "abstract": "Potash fertilizer is important for improving fruit quality, but its specific moderating roles must be further explored. To accomplish this objective, we utilized metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses to reveal the changes in metabolites and differential genes after potassium sulfate treatment, and we determined that the treatment substantially enhanced the intrinsic and external quality of 'Yanli' (Fragaria ×ananassa Duch.). The results showed that 345 metabolites were found in wide metabolomics, with 115 up-regulated and 230 down-regulated, in which the primary metabolites were more sugars, and the secondary metabolites were more flavonoids, accounting for 20.26% of the metabolites. Sugar metabolomics revealed a substantial increase in fructose content of 34.2 mg g-1 after potassium sulfate treatment. 2335 differentially expressed genes were found in the transcriptome. The KEGG enrichment scatter plot revealed that the more enriched pathways were metabolic pathways, starch and sucrose metabolism pathways, and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways. Combined transcriptome and metabolomics analyses showed that three genes, FaGal, FaINV and FaFK were highly influential in the sugar metabolic pathway, five candidate genes were identified in the anthocyanin metabolic pathway. This study revealed the regulatory mechanism of potassium sulfate treatment for improving strawberry fruit quality. Our findings provide an important basis for in-depth research on the mechanism of differentially expressed genes as well as substantial theoretical and practical guidance for the scientific and rational application of potash fertilizers in strawberry production.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of combining flexible ureteroscopy (FURS) with potassium sodium hydrogen citrate(PSHC) for the treatment of 20-30 mm uric acid renal stones. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of outcomes of patients with 20-30 mm uric acid renal stones who were treated with FURS and holmium lithotripsy was conducted between July 2021 and May 2024. Of them, 60 patients accepted FURS combined potassium sodium hydrogen citrate(PSHC) therapy while 70 patients underwent the FURS procedure alone. The demographic data, stone characteristics, surgical details, and perioperative outcomes of the patients were assessed retrospectively. Stone-free status was defined as the complete absence of stones on computed tomography. RESULTS: Totally 130 patients were enrolled and analyzed in this study. No significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of gender, age, body mass index, comorbidities, stone burden, stone density, number of stones, or laterality. The mean operation time, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, postoperative stay, and complication rate were also similar between the groups. The combined group incurred higher costs (p < 0.01),but it achieved significantly higher stone-free rate and Wisconsin Stone Quality of Life Questionnaire score at 4 weeks post-operatively (96.7% vs. 85.7%,p = 0.029;124.63 vs. 114.44,p < 0.01). Additionally, the combined group had a significantly higher urine pH at 4 weeks postoperatively compared to the non-combined group (6.63 vs. 5.50, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Compared to a single procedure, FURS combined with PSHC therapy is an effective and safe treatment for 20-30 mm uric acid renal stones.",

      "abstract": "With the increasing use of polylactic acid (PLA), more attention is turning to its post-treatment. Current methods such as natural decomposition, composting, and incineration are limited by significant carbon dioxide emissions and resource waste. Here, an efficient electrocatalytic conversion approach is presented to transform PLA waste into high-value chemicals, particularly potassium acetate (AA-K). By combining experimental and theoretical calculation, a high-performance catalyst Ni(Co)OOH is developed, which exhibits a current density of 403 mA cm⁻2 at 1.40 V (vs RHE) with 96% Faraday efficiency for AA-K in the electrooxidation of potassium lactate (LA-K, the product of PLA degradation in KOH). Through in situ spectroscopy techniques and density functional theory calculations, the structural regulation of the catalyst, and reaction pathways of the electrooxidation are elucidated. Further experiments demonstrate the superior catalytic performance of the Ni(Co)OOH catalyst in an industrial-scale tandem system. In 2 h of electrolysis, 320 g of PLA waste produces 232 L of H₂, yielding 1200 g of AA-K with 97% purity after neutralization and drying. The system demonstrates high conversion efficiency (approaching 97%) for diverse real PLA waste forms, including powder, cups, fibers, and cloth. This research provides a scalable and sustainable approach for PLA waste upcycling."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hypervolemic hyponatremia due to cirrhosis is caused by an increment in total body water (TBW) in excess of an increase in total exchangeable sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+). Therefore, therapy is aimed at treating not only the hyponatremia but there is an additional requirement to treat the volume overload. METHODS: Correction of cirrhosis-associated hyponatremia can be achieved by ensuring that the negative water (H2O) balance is in excess of the negative Na+ and K+ balance. This therapeutic approach can be attained by administering intravenous 3% sodium chloride (NaCl) and furosemide. RESULTS: Presently, there is no quantitative method for predicting the volume of IV 3% NaCl required to be infused in conjunction with furosemide that satisfies this therapeutic goal. Therefore, based on the empirical relationship between the plasma Na+ concentration and exchangeable Na+, K+, and TBW, a new formula is derived to calculate the volume of IV 3% NaCl required to raise the plasma Na+ concentration ([Na+]p1) to a targeted level ([Na+]p2) by attaining the desired amount of negative Na+, K+, and H2O balance. CONCLUSION: This new equation is the first quantitative approach for treating hypervolemic hyponatremia by attaining a negative H2O balance in excess of negative Na+ and K+ balance. This formula is particularly useful in the treatment of cirrhosis-associated hyponatremia where there are limited therapeutic options."

      "abstract": "Transport stress prior to slaughter frequently induces a stress response, negatively affecting meat quality. This study investigated the impact of dietary potassium magnesium sulphate (PMS) supplementation during the fattening stage on the stress response and meat quality in finishing pigs subjected to transport stress. The experiment involved two phases. Initially, 48 finishing pigs (68.00 ± 0.40 kg) were randomly allocated into two groups: a control group receiving a basal diet (CON) and a PMS-supplemented group receiving the basal diet with 0.50% PMS. Each group was housed in six pens, with four pigs per pen. After 60 days of feeding, in the second phase, two pigs from each pen were randomly selected for slaughter, with one pig subjected to a 4 h transportation stress prior to slaughter. Pigs were categorized into four treatment groups based on diet and stress: (1) control without transport stress, (2) control with transport stress, (3) PMS-supplemented without transport stress, and (4) PMS-supplemented with transport stress. Serum, jejunum, and longissimus thoracis muscle (LM) samples were collected. The results indicated that dietary PMS supplementation did not significantly affect growth performance during the fattening stage (p > 0.05). However, following transport, the PMS pigs showed a reduction in norepinephrine and cortisol concentrations (p = 0.09, p < 0.05) and a significant increase in serum glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity (p < 0.05). Furthermore, PMS supplementation significantly increased serum catalase (CAT), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activity, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (p < 0.05), while significantly reducing cholesterol (CHO) levels (p < 0.05). Transport stress adversely affected the intestinal health of finishing pigs, as evidenced by a decrease in intestinal villus height (0.05 < p < 0.1), a condition ameliorated by PMS supplementation. Additionally, transported pigs exhibited a higher drip loss24h in LM (p < 0.05), which was also alleviated through PMS supplementation. In conclusion, PMS supplementation mitigates transport stress and improves meat quality in finishing pigs."

This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated whether these self-monitoring devices can help to control BP in adults. The PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Ichushi-Web databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials that compared the effect of these devices (with or without additional dietary education) plus usual care on BP with that of usual care alone. The pooled effect of weighted mean difference between the intervention and control groups at the end of follow-up was estimated by random-effects meta-analysis. The primary outcome was the change in BP. Secondary outcomes included changes in the urinary Na/K ratio, and sodium and potassium excretions. Of 1525 studies screened, eight (with 1442 participants) were eligible for inclusion. Meta-analysis showed greater reductions in systolic BP by 2.45 (95% confidence interval, 0.04, 4.86) mmHg and diastolic BP by 1.38 (-0.15, 2.90) mmHg in the intervention vs. control groups. However, heterogeneity was high (I² = 69.4% for systolic BP and 65.1% for diastolic BP). The BP-lowering effect was not statistically different across different follow-up durations (4 weeks or 2-6 months) and intervention approaches (self-monitoring alone or combined with dietary education) (all p values for heterogeneity >0.1). Reductions in the urinary Na/K ratio and sodium excretion were greater in the intervention group. Self-monitoring devices may assist with BP reduction by promoting decreased sodium intake and increased potassium intake."

The Et2O molecule can be removed from the K+ coordination sphere affording coordinatively unsaturated alkoxide species which readily traps π-donor molecules.

      "abstract": "The engineered expression of K+ channels has been proposed as a potential treatment for epilepsy due to their exceptional ability to hyperpolarize neurons. A number of rodent models of gene therapy have yielded promising outcomes. However, the prevailing viral delivery methods for transgenes lack external control over expression, which may lead to the overproduction of K+ channel subunits and subsequent adverse effects. AAV-based expression of the KCNN4 gene in excitatory neurons has recently been demonstrated to suppress seizures by decreasing neuronal spiking activity. In this study, we examine the effects of overexpression of KCNN4, a gene encoding a pore-forming subunit of KCa3.1 channels, in neurons and HEK293 cells at the cellular and subcellular levels. We employ patch-clamp electrophysiology, immunocytochemistry, and imaging of tagged channel subunits to gain insights into the consequences of KCNN4 overexpression. Our results show that at higher expression levels, the number of channels at the cell membrane decreases, while the engineered expression of the KCa3.1 channel shows a peak in efficiency. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that KCNN4 overexpression results in decreased availability of other channels on the membrane and compromised functionality of other channels of the cells. These findings raise an important issue regarding the potential side effects of channel-based gene therapy for neurological disorders. It is critical to consider these side effects in order to successfully translate animal models into clinical trials.",

      "abstract": "Variants in genes encoding for voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels are frequent cause of drug-resistant pediatric epilepsies. Obtaining a molecular diagnosis gives the opportunity to assess the efficacy of pharmacological strategies based on in vitro features of mutant channels. In this retrospective observational study, we selected patients with drug-resistant pediatric epilepsies caused by variants in potassium channel encoding genes, followed at the Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico Carlo Besta of Milan, Italy. After the experimental characterization of variants' functional properties in transiently transfected Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, we identified drugs to be used as pharmacological approaches. We recruited six patients carrying different missense variants in four Kv channels (Kv7.2, Kv7.3, Kv3.1, and KNa1.1). In vitro experiments demonstrated that variants in Kv7 channels induced loss-of-function (LoF) effects, while those affecting Kv3.1 or KNa1.1 led to gain-of-function (GoF). Moreover, we found that the Kv7 channels activator gabapentin was able to revert the LoF effects caused by Kv7.2/Kv7.3 variants, and the potassium channel-blocker fluoxetine counteracted the GoF effects in Kv3.1 or KNa1.1 variants. According to experimental data, patients carrying Kv7 variants were treated with gabapentin. While this treatment resulted successful in two patients (#1, Kv7.2 G310S variant; #3, Kv7.3 V359L + Kv7.3 D542N), it resulted detrimental in the remaining case (#2, Kv7.2 D535E), requiring drug withdrawal. The application in vivo of fluoxetine to counteract GoF effects induced by Kv3.1 or KNa1.1 variants determined a significant reduction of both seizure frequency and behavior disturbances in patient #4 (Kv3.1 V425M), and in both subjects carrying KNa1.1 variants (#5, S937G and #6, R262Q). However, for the latter case, this drug was halted due to severe behavioral side effects. For most of the patients herein reported, pharmacological strategies, selected according to the in vitro functional properties of Kv-channels pathogenic variants, resulted in a significant improvement of both epileptic and cognitive features."

      "abstract": "Modified biochar has garnered considerable attention for its versatile applications in remediating soils contaminated with heavy metals. However, most existing studies have primarily focused on the stabilisation of heavy metals, with limited research exploring the broader environmental effects following the application of modified biochar. In this study, we developed a potassium permanganate (KMnO4)-hematite-modified biochar (MnFeB) as a passivating agent for heavy metals, specifically targeting cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn)-contaminated soils. We examined the effects of MnFeB on the biotoxicity of Cd and Zn, soil properties, enzyme activities, heavy metal resistance genes (czcA, czcC, and czcD), and the soil microbial community in contaminated soils. Treatment with MnFeB markedly reduced the soil diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)-extractable Zn and Cd contents by 18.79% and 43.65%, respectively. Furthermore, soil organic carbon (SOC), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and the availability of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium were found to be increased. MnFeB application also enhanced the activities of catalase, urease, and alkaline phosphatase while reducing the expression of czcA by 23.63%. Moreover, changes in the composition and diversity of soil bacterial and fungal communities were observed. These findings highlight the effects of environmental changes induced by MnFeB application on Cd/Zn-contaminated soil and offer theoretical support for employing passivation strategies in the remediation of heavy metal-contaminated soils.",

SDF with GIC can be administered together to stop the caries in cavitated lesions. Therefore, it is of interest to assess the shear bond strength of glass ionomer cement (type IX) to demineralized dentin in primary teeth treated with SDF and KI. The occlusal edges of sixty non-carious primary molar teeth were sliced until the yellow dentin was discernible. Each sample was embedded in an acrylic block with its occlusal surface facing upward after being submerged in a demineralizing solution for 7 days. Three groups were created from the samples: Group 1: The untreated group (control group) to which GIC type IX was placed directly; Group 2: Samples received immediate application of GIC type IX after getting treated with silver diamine fluoride (Experimental group) and Group 3: Silver diamine fluoride followed by potassium iodide followed by GIC type IX application (Experimental group). A Universal Testing Machine was subsequently utilized to perform a shear bond test on the specimens. Data shows that previously treated cement with SDF+KI increases the shear bond test without negatively impacted the bond strength GIC to dentin."

      "abstract": "The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), one of the most important ecological regions in the world, is experiencing a decline in ecological function as a result of severe grassland degradation. Elymus nutans is one of the ecological grass species for restoring degraded grasslands in QTP. The seed yield and seed quality are often limited by soil nutrients in QTP, so it is very important to optimize the application rates of fertilizer for E. nutans seed production. In this study, a \"3414\" fertilization experiment (nitrogen: 0 ~ 225 kg N ha- 1; phosphorus: 0 ~ 180 kg P2O5 ha- 1; potassium: 0 ~ 135 kg K2O ha- 1) was established in the third year of planting E. nutans seed field based on the soil nutrient supply situation in the planting area to explore the effects of combined application of N, P and K fertilizers on the seed yield and seed quality of E. nutans. The results showed that the balanced application of N, P and K fertilizers significantly improved the seed yield, seed quality and seed vigour of E. nutans. The seed yield of E. nutans was regulated by the seed yield components. Under different fertilization treatments, the number of fertile tillers and thousand kernel weight had a greater contribution to seed yield, followed by the number of spikelets per panicle. Compared to the no fertilization treatment, the combined application of N, P, and K fertilizers increased the seed yield of E. nutans by 23.05%-90.49%. The seed size, seed nutrient content, germination percentage and seedling growth of E. nutans were positively affected by the combined application of N, P and K fertilizers. The seed vigour of E. nutans increased by 38.23%-89.85% compared to the no fertilizer treatment. Fertilizer application promoted seed nutrient storage and increased seed size thereby promoting seed germination and seedling growth. The crude protein, soluble sugar and starch content of E. nutans seed increased by 9.70%-54.05%, 6.70%-25.70% and 4.31%-35.88%, respectively. Nitrogen fertilizer had a greater effect on seed yield and seed quality of E. nutans than phosphorus and potassium fertilizers. The balanced nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium fertilizers at an application rate of 150 kg N ha- 1, 120 kg P2O5 ha- 1, 90 kg K2O ha- 1 in the planting area of QTP was found to be the optimum fertilization amount for increasing seed yield, seed quality and net income. This study provides theoretical evidence and certain practical suggestions for sustainable forage seed production in alpine regions of QTP.",

      "abstract": "Voltage-gated potassium conductances g K play a critical role not only in normal neural function, but also in many neurological disorders and related therapeutic interventions. In particular, in an important animal model of epileptic seizures, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) administration is thought to induce seizures by reducing g K in cortex and other brain areas. Interestingly, 4-AP has also been useful in the treatment of neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury, where it is thought to improve action potential propagation in axonal fibers. Here, we examined g K downmodulation in biophysical models of cortical networks that included different neuron types organized in layers, potassium diffusion in interstitial and larger extracellular spaces, and glial buffering. Our findings are fourfold. First, g K downmodulation in pyramidal and fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons led to differential effects, making the latter much more likely to enter depolarization block. Second, both neuron types showed an increase in the duration and amplitude of action potentials, with more pronounced effects in pyramidal neurons. Third, a sufficiently strong g K reduction dramatically increased network synchrony, resulting in seizure-like dynamics. Fourth, we hypothesized that broader action potentials were likely to not only improve their propagation, as in 4-AP therapeutic uses, but also to increase synaptic coupling. Notably, graded-synapses incorporating this effect further amplified network synchronization and seizure-like dynamics. Overall, our findings elucidate different effects that g K downmodulation may have in cortical networks, explaining its potential role in both pathological neural dynamics and therapeutic applications.",

      "abstract": "Aldosterone is a key regulator of fluid and electrolyte balance in the body. It is often dysregulated in heart failure (HF) and is a key driver of cardiac remodelling and worse clinical outcomes. Potassium regulation is essential for normal cardiac, gastrointestinal and neuromuscular function. Serum potassium fluctuations are largely determined by aldosterone, the final step of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Dyskalaemia (i.e. hypokalaemia and hyperkalaemia) is prevalent in HF because of the disease itself, its therapies and related comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease. Prognostic implications of abnormal serum potassium follow a U-shaped curve, where both hypokalaemia and hyperkalaemia are associated with adverse outcomes. Hypokalaemia is associated with increased mortality, starting from potassium <4.0 mmol/l but especially at potassium <3.5 mmol/l. Hyperkalaemia, along with increasing arrhythmia risk, limits the use of lifesaving renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system inhibitors, which may have long-term survival implications. The advent of novel potassium binders aims to manage chronic hyperkalaemia and may allow for uptitration and optimal dosing of guideline-recommended therapy. This review discusses the impacts of dyskalaemia in HF, along with management strategies, including the relevance of potassium binder use in optimising HF treatment. Current and potential future aldosterone-modulating therapies, such as non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and aldosterone synthase inhibitors, are also discussed."

Small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK or KCa2.x) channels encoded by KCNN1-3 have recently gathered interest as novel antiarrhythmic targets with potential atrial-predominant effects. Here, the molecular composition of smallconductance calcium-activated potassium channels and their complex regulation in AF as the basis for understanding the distinct mechanism of action of pore-blockers (apamin, UCL1684, ICAGEN) and modulators of calcium-dependent activation (NS8593, AP14145, AP30663) are summarised. Furthermore, the preclinical and early clinical evidence for the role of small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel inhibitors in the treatment of AF are reviewed."

Integrins frequently recruit ion channels and transporters within complexes which behave as signaling hubs. A complex composed by β1 integrin, hERG1 K+ channel, the neonatal form of the Na+ channel NaV 1.5 (nNaV1.5) and the Na+/H+ antiporter NHE1 (NHE1/hERG1/β1/nNaV1.5 complex) has been recently described to be expressed and regulate relevant cancer related behaviors in Breast Cancer (BCa) cells. METHODS: We analyzed the expression and impact on outcome of the genes encoding the four proteins forming the NHE1/hERG1/β1/nNaV1.5 complex (SLC9A1, KCNH2, ITGB1 and SCN5A) in public datasets. The corresponding proteins were also evaluated by immunohistochemistry and their expression was correlated with clinic-pathological and molecular characteristics and patients' survival. RESULTS: The expression of KCNH2 and SCN5A was significantly correlated in primary BCa as occurs in the heart, although with a broader distribution, forming a functional network which also included ITGB1 and SLC9A1. The co-expression proteins emerged from the immunohistochemistry analysis. Interestingly, hERG1, nNav1.5 and the hERG1/β1 integrin complex associated with several clinical features, including molecular subtype and hormone receptor status. Moreover, hERG1 and the combination of hERG1 and nNav1.5 had impact on prognosis, contributing to identifying a group of patients with worse prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: hERG1 and nNav1.5 channels along with β1 integrins and the NHE1 antiporter are co-expressed in BCa both at gene and protein levels, assembling into a macromolecular complex. The NHE1/hERG1/β1/nNaV1.5 complex can be considered a novel biomarker and potential target for therapy for BCa patients."

      "abstract": "Distinguishing tumor maintenance genes from initiation, progression, and passenger genes is critical for developing effective therapies. We employed a functional genomic approach using the Lazy Piggy transposon to identify tumor maintenance genes in vivo and applied this to sonic hedgehog (SHH) medulloblastoma (MB). Combining Lazy Piggy screening in mice and transcriptomic profiling of human MB, we identified the voltage-gated potassium channel KCNB2 as a candidate maintenance driver. KCNB2 governs cell volume of MB-propagating cells (MPCs), with KCNB2 depletion causing osmotic swelling, decreased plasma membrane tension, and elevated endocytic internalization of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), thereby mitigating proliferation of MPCs to ultimately impair MB growth. KCNB2 is largely dispensable for mouse development and KCNB2 knockout synergizes with anti-SHH therapy in treating MB. These results demonstrate the utility of the Lazy Piggy functional genomic approach in identifying cancer maintenance drivers and elucidate a mechanism by which potassium homeostasis integrates biomechanical and biochemical signaling to promote MB aggression."

However, excessive pursuit of yield during cultivation has led to a decrease in medicinal ingredients. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of two single-factor treatments, shading (SK0) and potassium application (S0K), and their coupling treatment (SK) on bulb biomass and medicinal substance content, along with the role of rhizosphere microorganisms. Shading increased the content of active ingredients in bulbs by approximately 11.7% while decreasing bulb biomass by approximately 11.3%. SK treatment mitigated the biomass reduction caused by SK0 treatment while enhancing the accumulation of active ingredients in F. thunbergii, up to 1.2 times higher than that of SK0 treatment. In rhizosphere soil, Allorhizobium-Neorhizobium-Pararhizobium-Rhizobium (ANPR), Chryseobacterium, Brevundimonas, and Phoma exhibited significant positive correlations with medicinal components, among which ANPR, Brevundimonas, Chryseobacterium, and Phoma were responsive to SK treatments. Also, Burkholderia-Caballeronia-Paraburkholderia (BCP) and Brevundimonas responded to changes at different growth stages of F. thunbergii. The relative abundance of these microorganisms was associated with the alterations of soil factors resulting from shading or K application. Our results indicate that these microorganisms are beneficial to the growth of bulbs and the synthesis of active components in F. thunbergii. The combination of shading and K application may regulate the accumulation of medicinal substances in F. thunbergii by modulating the structure of the soil microbial community. Our results serve as a reference for soil improvement for medicinal plant cultivation."

      "abstract": "This research was carried out to determine the effects of potassium humate on the lactation performance and metabolic parameters of dairy cows during the transition period. Potassium humate was added to the concentrate feed at the following levels: (a) control (0%), (b) 0.5%, (c) 1%, (d) 1.5%, and (e) 2% humas, during the dry period from -60 to 0 days until calving. The results indicated that the total milk yield after 305 days was higher in the 0.5% group than in the 2% humic acid group. The average daily milk yield from lactation was also greater in the 0.5% group than in the 2% humic acid group. In terms of metabolic health and blood biochemistry, lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, NEFAs, and BHBA were different among the treatment groups. No effects were detected on the blood physiology parameters of the calves. The IgG concentration in the colostrum and serum of calves on day 1 and 2 were higher in the 0.5% and 1% humic acid groups, respectively, than in the other groups. Overall, adding humic acid, especially at the dose of 0.5%, to the concentrate feed of dairy cows during the dry period resulted in an increased postpartum milk yield for the cows and increased serum IgG in both the cows and calves, with decreased NEFAs on the calving day and decreased postpartum BHBA for cows."

      "abstract": "Voltage-gated Kv7 potassium channels, particularly Kv7.2 and Kv.7.3 channels, play a critical role in modulating susceptibility to seizures, and mutations in genes that encode these channels cause heterogeneous epilepsy phenotypes. On the basis of this evidence, activation of Kv7.2 and Kv.7.3 channels has long been considered an attractive target in the search for novel antiseizure medications. Ezogabine (retigabine), the first Kv7.2/3 activator introduced in 2011 for the treatment of focal seizures, was withdrawn from the market in 2017 due to declining use after discovery of its association with pigmentation changes in the retina, skin, and mucosae. A novel formulation of ezogabine for pediatric use (XEN496) has been recently investigated in children with KCNQ2-related developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, but the trial was terminated prematurely for reasons unrelated to safety. Among novel Kv7.2/3 openers in clinical development, azetukalner has shown dose-dependent efficacy against drug-resistant focal seizures with a good tolerability profile and no evidence of pigmentation-related adverse effects in early clinical studies, and it is now under investigation in phase III trials for the treatment of focal seizures, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and major depressive disorder. Another Kv7.2/3 activator, BHV-7000, has completed phase I studies in healthy subjects, with excellent tolerability at plasma drug concentrations that exceed the median effective concentrations in a preclinical model of anticonvulsant activity, but no efficacy data in patients with epilepsy are available to date. Among other Kv7.2/3 activators in clinical development as potential antiseizure medications, pynegabine and CB-003 have completed phase I safety and pharmacokinetic studies, but results have not been yet reported. Overall, interest in targeting Kv7 channels for the treatment of epilepsy and for other indications remains strong. Future breakthroughs in this area could come from exploitation of mechanistic differences in the action of Kv7 activators, and from the development of molecules that combine Kv7 activation with other mechanisms of action.",

The aim of our study was to assess the nutritional and quality of life of patient-reported outcomes among patients who have undergone laser resection of tongue cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was undertaken of patients treated with KTP laser resection of T1/T2 tongue squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) between 2011-2019. University of Washington Quality of life 4 questionnaire (UW-QOL) and the abridged scored patient-generated subjective global assessment (AB PG-SGA) were used. Scores were correlated to analyse the QOL and nutritional status. RESULTS: 20 patients participated and were categorised into three groups based on AB PG-SGA score. The physical and social-emotional QOL scores were higher for patients who had a better nutritional status. There was a linear negative correlation between the AB PG-SGA score, physical and social-emotional domains of the QOL. No association was found between histopathological differentiation, neck dissection surgeries and the AB PG-SGA score. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the KTP laser to excise tongue T1 and T2 SCC yields acceptable results in terms of QOL and patient-reported nutritional outcomes. There is a significant trend identifying that as a patient's nutritional status improves quality of life is enhanced and vice versa. The QOL and the nutritional status of patients were not affected by the different histopathological grades of SCC or whether they had undergone a neck dissection or not.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To compare remineralisation efficacy between silver diamine fluoride (SDF) combined with potassium iodide (KI) and sodium fluoride (NaF) varnish using hydroxyapatite (HAP) artificial white spot lesions (AWSLs) demineralisation model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 25 HAP disks was randomly divided into five groups (n = 5): baseline, AWSLs, deionized water (DW), SDF-KI or F-varnish. After AWSLs were developed, the specimen was treated with either deionized water, SDF-KI or F-varnish. These specimens were then subjected to pH-cycling for 7 days. The remineralisation potential was assessed by measuring changes in Vickers hardness (VHN). Morphological and compositional analyses were conducted using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray (EDX), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Ion-selective electrodes (ISE) were utilised to measure calcium and fluoride release. RESULTS: SDF-KI treatment demonstrated statistically significant remineralisation potential in restoring VHN values vs baseline levels (p 0.001). SEM, EDX, and XRD analyses confirmed the mineral deposits to indicate remineralisation. The uptake of calcium was higher in SDF-KI than in F-varnish (p = 0.011). The fluorapatite (FAP) and fluoride-substituted apatite formation were validated by FTIR and XRD analyses. CONCLUSION: SDF-KI and F-varnish applications are both effective in promoting remineralisation on HAP disks. The application of SDF-KI affected the physicochemical and mechanical properties of demineralised HAP. The SDF-KI showed more formation of fluoride-substituted apatite and is effective in the hardening of demineralised HAP.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute aluminum phosphide (ALP) poisoning presents a significant global medical challenge, particularly in regions where it is commonly used as a pesticide. Despite medical advancements, mortality rates from ALP poisoning remain high. Glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) infusion therapy has emerged as a potential treatment for ALP poisoning due to its ability to counteract its toxic effects on metabolism and heart function. However, there is limited institutional data on the effectiveness of GIK therapy in treating ALP poisoning. Hence, this study aims to evaluate the therapeutic impact of GIK infusion therapy in managing acute ALP poisoning within our institution. The research aims to provide valuable insights into the efficacy of GIK therapy, with the potential to enhance patient outcomes and guide clinical practices in ALP poisoning management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Resuscitation Unit of the Emergency Department of Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), Peshawar, from February 1, 2021, to May 31, 2021, using convenient sampling of all patients with aluminum phosphide (ALP) poisoning meeting the inclusion criteria. The study group included 15 ALP poisoning cases treated with GIK infusion therapy combined with standard supportive measures and examined individuals with ALP poisoning admitted to the Resuscitation Unit during a specific period, comparing their outcomes to those observed before the introduction of GIK therapy. Randomization was based on time span, as GIK therapy was introduced in October 2020. Inclusion criteria encompassed a confirmed history of ALP poisoning with at least one deranged vital parameter, including patients of all genders and age groups. At the same time, we excluded patients with normal blood pressure on arrival, no deterioration four hours post-presentation, or those who expired before arrival. Data on hospital registration number, gender, age, arrival date, serial blood pressures, supportive measures, GIK infusion usage, and outcomes were analyzed using SPSS version 20.0 to assess the therapeutic impact of GIK infusion therapy. RESULTS: Among 15 ALP poisoning cases, 20% resulted in fatalities, with 80% either transferred to acute units (40%). Mortality was highest (66%) in the 20-29 age group, contrasting with no deaths in the 1-19 age group. Additionally, 33% mortality occurred in the 30-39 age group. Only 25% of patients with blood pressure below 91/61 succumbed. GIK therapy led to hemodynamic stability, prolonged unit stays, and increased transfers. Patients in acute units had longer stays compared to discharged or expired cases, reflecting the nuanced dynamics of ALP poisoning management. CONCLUSION: This research aimed to systematically examine the effect of GIK infusion therapy on ALP poisoning cases at LRH, Peshawar, offering insights into its effectiveness compared to previous cases and reducing mortality by enhancing cardiac function."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected publications related to P-CAB in the treatment of acid-related diseases in the Web of Science (WOS) Core Collection from the establishment of the database to 30 June 2024. We evaluated the publication volume and citation status over the years using the WOS platform, and visualized the authors, countries, institutions, keywords, and citations of the publications using CiteSpace and VOSviewer. RESULTS: This study included a total of 455 articles. The number of publications and citations related to research has been increasing year by year. The results show that the scholars with the highest number of publications mainly come from South Korea and Japan. Scholars such as Geun Seog Song, Bongtae Kim, and Nobuhiro Inatomi produced many works in related fields. The most popular drug in this field was vonoprazan, and research on this drug mainly focused on the effectiveness and safety evaluation of ARDs such as Helicobacter pylori infection, gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcers, etc. Researchers were concerned about the evaluation of treatment regimens and efficacy comparison between P-CABs and traditional proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in the treatment of ARDs. At the same time, researchers are also closely monitoring the potential adverse reactions and long-term adverse outcomes of clinical application of P-CABs for ARDs. CONCLUSION: The clinical application of P-CABs, represented by vonoprazan, in ARDs is receiving widespread attention from researchers. The exploration of the application of this type of drug in ARDs is constantly expanding, and it is a research field with great clinical value and research potential."

We aim to investigate the efficacy and safety of different doses of X842 vs lansoprazole in the treatment of patients with erosive esophagitis (EE). METHODS: This phase 2 study included 90 patients with EE (Los Angeles grades A-D) who were randomized (1:1:1) to receive oral low-dose X842 (50 mg/d, n = 31), high-dose X842 (100 mg/d, n = 31), or lansoprazole (30 mg/d, n = 30) for 4 weeks. The main efficacy end point was the EE healing rate, which was the proportion of patients who achieved endoscopic healing after 4 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: For intention-to-treat analysis, the EE healing rates at 4 weeks were 93.6% (29/31), 79.3% (23/29), and 80.0% (24/30) for the X842 50 mg, the X842 100 mg, and the lansoprazole 30 mg groups. For per-protocol analysis, the EE healing rates at 4 weeks were 93.6% (29/31), 80.8% (21/26), and 82.1% (23/28) in the 3 groups, respectively. The EE healing rate did not significantly differ among the 3 groups in either the intention-to-treat ( P = 0.2351) or per-protocol ( P = 0.3320) analysis. The incidence of drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events did not differ among groups. No severe drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in the X842 group. DISCUSSION: Our findings confirmed that X842 had efficacy and a favorable safety profile similar to those of lansoprazole. Therefore, X842, a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker, is expected to become a promising therapeutic agent for EE.",

      "abstract": "Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease and its management is palliative. There is no specific dietary protocol for SS patients. A gluten-free diet has been tested in SS patients with celiac disease (CD) and indicated modest improvements. Whether gluten-free diets per sè could alleviate autoimmune inflammatory processes in the salivary glands of SS patients with associated CD or even in SS patients without CD is an interesting hypothesis and warrants clinical studies. Hypokalemia in SS patients is among the most frequent sequelae of renal tubular acidosis. Supplementation with potassium (K)-rich diets can reduce inflammation and oxidative stress. K level in CD patients is highly abnormal at diagnosis and gluten-free diets help to normalize its serum level in CD patients. Furthermore, treatment of severe cases of SS requires concomitant glucocorticoid therapy and K supplementation. Results of two separate clinical trials in (i) patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) -a disease with similar pathology to SS- indicated that the enhanced serum cortisol followed K supplementation, and in (ii) celiac patients, serum K levels were normalized after the administration of a gluten-free diet. We reviewed the literature extensively on this topic to propose a hypothesis to address this problem and suggest a novel potential for K-rich, gluten-free diets in SS patients. Based on causal associations, we propose that higher K absorption and cortisol secretion following gluten-free diets accompanied by K-rich diets in SS patients with low serum potassium levels, may confer a higher therapeutic potential. Clinical trials are needed to test this hypothesis."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The diagnosis of fungal keratitis using potassium hydroxide (KOH) smears of corneal scrapings enables initiation of the correct antimicrobial therapy at the point-of-care but requires time-consuming manual examination and expertise. This study evaluates the efficacy of a deep learning framework, dual stream multiple instance learning (DSMIL), in automating the analysis of whole slide imaging (WSI) of KOH smears for rapid and accurate detection of fungal infections. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. PARTICIPANTS: Corneal scrapings from 568 patients with suspected fungal keratitis; 51% contained filamentous fungi according to human expert interpretation. METHODS: Dual stream multiple instance learning was employed to analyze WSI of KOH smears. Due to the extensive size of these images, often exceeding 100 000 pixels, conventional computer vision methods (e.g., convolutional neural networks) are not feasible. Dual stream multiple instance learning segments the WSI into patches for analysis, extracting relevant features from each patch and aggregating these to make a comprehensive slide-level diagnosis while generating heat maps to visualize areas contributing most to the prediction. Fivefold cross-validation was used for training and validation, with a hold-out test set comprising 15% of the total samples. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), F1 score, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) in distinguishing fungal from nonfungal slides. RESULTS: Dual stream multiple instance learning demonstrated an overall AUC of 0.88 with an accuracy of 79% and an F1 score of 0.79 in distinguishing fungal from nonfungal slides, with sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 71%, PPV of 80%, and NPV of 79%. For \"consensus cases,\" where 2 human graders agreed on the slide interpretation, the model achieved an accuracy of 85% and an F1 score of 0.85. For \"discrepant cases,\" the accuracy was 71% with an F1 score of 0.71. The generated heatmaps highlighted regions corresponding to fungal elements. Code and models are open-sourced and available at https://github.com/Redd-Cornea-AI/KOH-Smear-DSMIL. CONCLUSIONS: The DSMIL framework shows significant promise in automating interpretation of KOH smears. Its capability to handle large, high-resolution WSI data and accurately detect fungal infections, while providing visual explanations through heatmaps, could enhance the scalability of KOH smear interpretation, ultimately reducing the global burden of blindness from infectious keratitis.

      "abstract": "Amniotic fluid is a complex and dynamic biological matrix that surrounds the fetus during the pregnancy. From this fluid, is possible to isolate various cell types with particular interest directed towards stem cells (AF-SCs). These cells are highly appealing due to their numerous potential applications in the field of regenerative medicine for tissues and organs as well as for treating conditions such as traumatic or ischemic injuries to the nervous system, myocardial infarction, or cancer. AF-SCs, when subcultured in the presence of basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF), have been shown to survive and migrate when transplanted into the striatum of the rat brain, exhibiting behavior characteristics of neuronal/glial progenitor cells. In this work, we performed an electrophysiological characterization to ascertain the propensity of AF-SCs to differentiate into glial and neuronal cells by bFGF. By using patch clamp technique we characterized a fibroblast-like morphology that display a barium-sensitive inward-rectifying potassium current (Kir) and calcium-activated potassium currents (KCa). The electrophysiological and calcium dynamics of histamine, a marker of undifferentiated neural progenitors, was further studied. Histamine promoted intracellular calcium increase by Fura-2 recording and calcium-activated potassium current activation with a similar temporal profile in AF-SC. The data presented in this paper ultimately confirm the expression in AF-SCs of the Kir and KCa currents, also showing regulation by endogenous stimuli such as histamine for the latter.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent advancements highlight the role of finerenone, a non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (nsMRA), in DKD management. Studies like FIDELIO-DKD, FIGARO-DKD, and FIDELITY have demonstrated finerenone's efficacy in reducing CKD progression and cardiovascular risks in DKD patients. Trials reveal higher incidence of hyperkalemia in finerenone groups compared to controls. Asian populations are noted to have a higher risk, emphasizing the need for close monitoring. To manage hyperkalemia, evidence-based protocols suggested starting finerenone with potassium level below 4.8mEq/L, discontinuing if potassium level exceed 5.5mEq/L. Strategies include dietary potassium restriction, potassium binders, and frequent monitoring. While these managements help mitigate risks, real-word challenges call for further evidence to refine practical guidelines. Finerenone emerges as a promising therapy for DKD but requires careful management to prevent hyperkalemia, ensuring optimal patient outcomes."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adjusting dietary potassium intake based on 24-hour urinary potassium excretion is the primary method of preventing hyperkalemia. Currently, there is no accurate and convenient method for calculating maximum 24-hour urinary potassium excretion in kidney failure without replacement therapy patients. We developed and validated two new models to assess the upper limit of dietary potassium consumption in this high-risk cohort, using the maximum 24-hour urinary potassium excretion as a proxy. METHODS: The data of 145 kidney failure without replacement therapy patients with hyperkalemia was gathered. The prediction models were developed using multilayer perceptron and stepwise multiple linear regression utilizing a stochastic sample of 102 (70%) patients. Within the rest 43 (30%), the performance of various models was independently verified. RESULTS: The two new models had low bias (-0.02 and -0.57 mmol/24h vs 66.74 and 79.91 mmol/24h, mean absolute error = 5.57 and 5.22 vs 68.95 and 81.37), high accuracy (percentage of calculated values within_±30% of measured values = 83.45% and 84.14% vs 0.00% and 0.00%), high correlation with measured values (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.72 and 0.72 vs 0.46 and 0.45, intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.67 and 0.70 vs 0.03 and 0.03) and high agreement with 24-hour urine potassium measurements (95% limits of agreement of Bland-Altman plot = 13.70 and 13.20 mmol/24h vs 113.8 and 191.3 mmol/24h). CONCLUSION: These new models show high clinical application value for the calculation of maximum 24-hour urinary potassium excretion in kidney failure without replacement therapy patients with hyperkalemia.",

      "abstract": "The Working Group Preanalytical Phase of the European Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine advises suppressing haemolysis-sensitive tests when haemolysis is clinically significant, as improper specimen handling can rupture red blood cells, increasing potassium levels. Thus, a correctly repeated blood sample should show lower potassium levels than a haemolysed one. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of haemolysed samples with potassium levels below the reference range and whether this predicts hypokalemia in repeated collections. From March 2022 to March 2024, 396,640 non-haemolysed samples (H-index < 2 UA) were analyzed. Samples with an H-index ≥ 2 AU were classified as haemolysed, and potassium values were suppressed. Warnings were issued for haemolysed samples with potassium below the reference range (3.4-4.5 mmol/L), advising new sample collection. Twenty-five (0.01%) repeat samples were taken within 24 hours of a previously haemolysed sample with low potassium. Severe and moderate hypokalemia were more common in these repeats, with severe hypokalemia (≤2.5 mmol/L) found in 48% of repeat tests, compared to 0.3% in all samples. Though rare, a decrease in potassium in haemolysed samples often precedes hypokalemia diagnosis. Implementing a simple and cost-effective LIS algorithm to alert clinicians could potentially reduce diagnosis and treatment time.",

      "abstract": "A subset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients tests positive for antibodies commonly associated with autoimmune neurological diseases, including voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC)-complex antibodies. Although an autoimmune basis for ALS remains speculative, and immunomodulatory therapies have shown minimal benefit as of yet, isolated cases suggest that VGKC-complex antibodies may be relevant to disease type and progression. In this report, we present a case of ALS in which increasing VGKC-complex antibody levels correlated with clinical decline, raising the question of whether such antibodies could serve as biomarkers of progression in VGKC-complex antibody-positive ALS patients. To date, no published studies have systematically evaluated changes in VGKC-complex antibody levels in ALS patients over time. Our findings suggest that tracking VGKC-complex antibodies in ALS may offer insights into disease progression and prompt further investigation into their potential role as prognostic biomarkers, especially in certain subtypes of the disease."
