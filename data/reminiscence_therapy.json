      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Reminiscence therapies are beneficial for people who have dementia or mild cognitive impairment and are widely used among older adults in service institutions and community health care. However, it is not clear which reminiscence therapy delivery format is the most effective. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate all reminiscence therapy delivery formats with regard to comparative cognitive function, depressive symptoms, quality of life and adherence, among people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment. METHODS: Nine databases were searched systematically to screen pertinent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published as of March 7, 2025. The effects of and adherence to reminiscence therapy delivery formats were ranked by using a network meta-analysis based on frequentist approaches. The inconsistency between direct comparison and indirect comparison was examined by the node-splitting method. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was calculated to rank probability of all reminiscence therapy delivery formats. RESULTS: Fifty-three RCTs involving 4582 participants were included from 4363 records. Compared to the control groups, reminiscence therapy improved cognitive function, reduced depressive symptoms and improved quality of life and this differed according to delivery format. Digital reminiscence therapy had better effects relative to treatment as usual (SMD = 5.02, 95 % CI: 2.57, 7.48) was the highest ranking (SUCRA = 93.6 %) for cognitive function. Digital reminiscence therapy had better effects compared to treatment as usual (SMD = -5.98, 95 % CI: -10.67, -1.30) with highest ranking (SUCRA = 94.9 %) for depressive symptoms. Individual reminiscence therapy had better effects compared to treatment as usual (SMD = 5.15, 95 % CI: 3.61, 6.70) and ranked first (SUCRA = 98.3 %) for quality of life. Group reminiscence therapy was the best format compared to individual reminiscence therapy (SMD = 2.36, 95 % CI: 1.37, 4.06) and treatment as usual (SMD = 1.71, 95 % CI: 1.07, 2.73) with highest ranking (SUCRA = 95.6 %). CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests that digital reminiscence therapy seems to be the most effective format for people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment and adherence is likely to be higher following group reminiscence therapy. Considering the limitations of this review, more comprehensive multi-group randomized controlled trials are warranted to compare the effects of and adherence to reminiscence therapy delivery formats for people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Group reminiscence therapy has shown potential in improving the mental well-being of older adults. The present study aimed to assess the mental health of older adults in selected elderly care facilities in the urban part of north Tamil Nadu to evaluate the effectiveness of group reminiscence therapy and identify the association of their mental well-being with sociodemographic factors. METHODS: Using a convenience sampling method, a quasiexperimental pretest-posttest study was conducted over a 6-week period. It included 30 participants from one elderly care facility for the experimental group and 30 from two other homes (12 and 18 participants, respectively) as the control group, all meeting specific inclusion criteria. During the first week, sociodemographic data of the participants were collected, and their mental health was assessed using the General Health Questionnaire-12. Reminiscence therapy was provided to the experimental group from the 2nd to the 5th week. A posttest was conducted for both the groups during the 6th week to assess the participants' mental health. RESULTS: The experimental group showed a male preponderance from urban habitat, whereas the control group was dominated by women from rural background. The study revealed that most participants in both the experimental groups (26/86.7%) and control groups (29/96.7%) were distressed at the beginning of the study. Following the reminiscence therapy, twenty-three (76.7%) residents in the experimental group showed a significant and reassuring improvement in mental health. INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: The distress identified during pretest underscores the significant mental health challenges faced by older adults. Reminiscence therapy has an important role in promoting mental health of older adults. This study reinstates the potential of reminiscence therapy in improving their quality of life. Longitudinal, community-based studies are required to extend the significance of the therapy."

      "abstract": "The growing aging population presents challenges for healthcare systems, with many elderly residents in old age homes experiencing loneliness and reduced autonomy. Reminiscence therapy, which involves recalling past experiences, shows promise in improving well-being and quality of life. Therefore, it is of interest to evaluate the effectiveness of reminiscence therapy over 4 weeks at an old age home in Kodambakkam, Chennai, using a pre-test and post-test design with 50 elderly participants. Results showed significant improvements, with well-being scores increasing by 12.17% and quality of life scores rising by 15.69%. Qualitative data revealed that engagement and family dynamics contributed to positive outcomes, while feelings of loneliness remained complex. The findings suggest that reminiscence therapy can enhance psychological well-being and should be incorporated more widely in elderly care."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study sought to examine whether reminiscence therapy based on memories of hard work is more effective than reminiscence therapy based on memories of enjoyment for promoting positive reminiscence (i.e., quality of reminiscence) associated with the prevention or reduction of depressive symptoms in community-dwelling older people. METHODS: The participants were 26 community-dwelling older people (three men and 23 women) aged 65 or older who attended an elder citizens' club and a salon. Participants were randomly assigned to either the reminiscence therapy based on memories of hard work (recalling things they thought they did well in the past) group or the reminiscence therapy based on memories of enjoyment group. In both groups, the sessions lasted 30-50 min each, once a week, for 4 weeks. For assessment, we used the Positive and Negative Reminiscence Scale, the Geriatric Depression Scale 15, and the Life Satisfaction Index Z. Analysis of covariance using Bayesian statistics was conducted using the amount of change in each scale as the objective variable. RESULTS: There was a significant difference between groups in the change in Positive Reminiscence Scale scores (expected a posteriori = -1.87, β = -0.23, t = -2.28, 95% Bayesian confidence interval = [-3.45, -0.26], P (b > 0) (which was calculated as the probability that the coefficient (b) was greater than zero) = 0.01), suggesting a small-to-moderate effect in the reminiscence therapy based on memories of enjoyment group compared with the reminiscence therapy based on memories of hard work group. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that reminiscence therapy based on memories of enjoyment may promote more positive reminiscence among community-dwelling older people than therapy based on memories of hard work.",

This study assessed the impact of the reminiscence therapy-involved care program (RTIC) on cognition, anxiety, depression, and satisfaction among patients with elderly acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who received percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).In total, 152 elderly patients with ACS undergoing PCI were randomized into the RTIC (n = 76) and routine care (RC) (n = 76) groups to receive the corresponding 6-month interventions. The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores were evaluated at discharge (M0), 3rd month (M3), and 6th month (M6). The hospital anxiety and depression scale for anxiety/depression (HADS-A/HADS-D) and patient satisfaction scores were assessed at M0, 1st month (M1), M3, and M6.The MMSE score at M6 (27.6 ± 2.0 versus 26.7 ± 2.1, P = 0.011) increased, whereas the percentage of cognitive impairment at M6 (27.9% versus 44.8%, P = 0.042) declined in the RTIC group versus the RC group. Moreover, the RTIC group achieved a low HADS-D score at M3 (6.5 ± 2.0 versus 7.4 ± 2.6, P = 0.035) and M6 (6.3 ± 1.9 versus 7.2 ± 2.5, P = 0.016), but a similar HADS-A score and percentages of depression and anxiety at any assessment point versus the RC group. Patient satisfaction at M3 (82.3 ± 12.0 versus 77.7 ± 11.4, P = 0.020) and M6 (85.6 ± 11.0 versus 79.4 ± 12.0, P = 0.002) was higher in the RTIC group than in the RC group. In the subgroup analysis, patients with and without cognitive impairment at M0 and those with depression at M0 benefited from RTIC. RTIC promotes cognition, psychological health, and satisfaction among elderly patients with ACS undergoing PCI.",

However, questions remain regarding this therapy, particularly about the feasibility of developing successful therapeutic interventions for non-clinical older adults. This systematic review aimed to provide evidence on the intervention contents of experimental studies using group reminiscence therapy in elderly individuals. A descriptive systematic review design was applied using the Web of Science database. Out of the 127 studies reviewed, only 26 examined reminiscence therapy interventions with non-clinical older adults. These studies revealed evidence regarding the positive impacts of reminiscence therapy on mental health and well-being outcomes, including depression, anxiety, stress, life satisfaction, happiness, and general health. Overall, the existing literature on the efficacy of reminiscence therapy in older adults is limited and much more research is required to understand the therapeutic interventions in this population."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of the Group Reminiscence Therapy assisted by Memory Specificity Training (GRT-mest) in older adults, and to further investigate the indirect effect of autobiographical memory in improving depressive symptoms. METHODS: In this single-blind, three-arm parallel group, cluster randomized controlled trial, 78 eligible participants were randomly assigned to two intervention groups and one control group in two nursing homes, and assessments were conducted at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and 1-month and 3-month follow-ups. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 26.0. RESULTS: The GRT-mest had more significant improvements in depressive symptoms (ES=0.08, P < 0.001), autobiographical memory (ES=0.07, P < 0.001), and rumination (ES=0.07, P < 0.001) compared to other two groups, and these effects were maintained up to 3 months post-intervention. The improvement of autobiographical memory only had an indirect effect on improving depressive symptoms at immediately post-intervention (Indirect effect =-1.3231, 95% CI [-2.4187, -0.4053], P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The GRT-mest can improve depressive symptoms, autobiographical memory, and rumination in older adults, with these effects being maintained for up to 3 months. Additionally, the improvement in autobiographical memory plays a short-term mediating role in alleviating depressive symptoms. This study further supports the theoretical effectiveness of incorporating mest into the treatment of depressive symptoms among older adults in domestic settings.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Reminiscence therapy (RT) is a widely used approach to promote well-being among older adults and is an effective intervention method for older adults with diverse health conditions, including community-dwelling older adults. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to determine the impact of group RT on assessments of depression, anxiety and self-esteem in older adults living in the community. METHODS: We implemented sessions of group simple RT. The sample consisted of 24 older adults living in the community who attended a 12-week RT course. The duration of each reminiscence session was 60 min. The average age of the sample was 74.7 years. We used the Geriatric Depression Scale, the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory, the Rosenberg self-esteem scale, the Older adults' Quality of Life-Brief version and the Sense of Coherence scale to assess mental health outcomes before and after intervention. RESULTS: After intervention, we observed statistically significant improvements in assessments of depression (p < 0.001), anxiety (p = 0.011), self-esteem (p = 0.007) and the comprehensibility dimension of the sense of coherence scale (p = 0.039). Depression showed the largest effect size (Cohen's d = 0.870; 95% CI: 0.392 to 1.335), indicating a large effect, followed by self-esteem (Cohen's d = 0.612; 95% CI: -1.044 to -0.170) and anxiety (Cohen's d = 0.543; 95% CI: 0.108 to 0.967), both of which demonstrated a moderate effect. CONCLUSIONS: We found group RT to be effective for several outcomes among older adults. Reminiscence is a good non-invasive treatment for the promotion of mental health in community-dwelling older adults. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: As research has now established RT to be an essential component of activities for older adults in senior care facilities, we should also offer it to those living in the community as an effective activity for the promotion of healthy aging among older adults.",

METHODS: A comprehensive search strategy utilizing MeSH terms and free-text keywords was employed to systematically search the Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane databases up to January 24, 2024. Randomized controlled trials(RCTs) investigating RT monotherapy for improving cognitive decline were included. The primary outcomes of interest were the standard Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Additionally, all data analyses will be performed using RevMan5.4 software. RESULTS: ‌ We identified 612 studies, and 24 studies met the inclusion criteria, involving 2650 participants. This meta-analysis shows that RT significantly improves immediate and long-term cognitive decline with Standardized Mean Difference(SMD) and 95% CI of 0.55 [0.37, 0.73] and 0.50 [0.11, 0.88], respectively. However, there is no significant difference in efficacy between subgroups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: ‌ Our findings suggestS that RT significantly improves cognitive decline, with no significant differences between subgroups. This suggests that RT is universal in improving cognition and that the way RT is implemented has no significant effect on outcomes. These findings supportS the use of RT as a reliable non-pharmacological treatment option to enhance cognitive function.",

METHODS: This exploratory research used a mixed-methods design. The app was developed in two phases. In the first phase, the research team identified the requirements and designed a prototype. In the second phase, experienced occupational therapists evaluated the prototype. RESULTS: The research team determined the app's required functionalities, grouped into eight major themes: register related persons and caregivers; record the patient's life story memories; prepare a reminiscence therapy session; conduct a session; end a session; assess the patient; automatically generate a life story; other requirements. The first phase ended with the development of a prototype. In the second phase, eight occupational therapists performed a series of tasks using all the application's functionalities. Most of these tasks were very easy (Single Ease Question). The level of usability was considered excellent (System Usability Scale). Participants believed that the app would save practitioners time, enrich therapy sessions and improve their effectiveness. The qualitative results were summarized in two broad themes: (a) acceptability of the app; and (b) areas for improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Participating occupational therapists generally agreed that the co-designed app appears to be a versatile tool that empowers these professionals to manage reminiscence interventions."

This study aimed to compare the effects of individual occupation-based reminiscence therapy at home (IOBRT-H) and individual occupation-based reminiscence therapy in a dementia care centre (IOBRT-DCC) on cognitive function, depression, and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) among community-dwelling older adults with mild dementia. METHODS: This study was a randomised controlled trial. Twenty-six community-dwelling older adults with mild dementia were randomised to the IOBRT-H (n = 13) and IOBRT-DCC (n = 13) groups. The intervention was conducted for 10 weeks, with one session a week and each session lasting 60 min for both groups. Cognitive function was assessed using the Allen Cognitive Level Screen (ACLS), depression with the short form of the Geriatric Depression Scale Korean version (SGDS-K), and IADL using the Seoul-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (S-IADL). RESULTS: Both the IOBRT-H and IOBRT-DCC groups showed significant improvements in ACLS scores (P < 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively). The SGDS-K score decreased only in the IOBRT-H group (P < 0.01). Between the groups, the IOBRT-H group had significantly greater improvements in both ACLS and SGDS-K scores than the IOBRT-DCC group (P < 0.05 and P < 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study's results indicated the potential for applying IBORT-H as an intervention to improve cognitive function and reduce depression in community-dwelling older adults with mild dementia. We expect the findings of this study to serve as useful foundational data for developing home-visiting cognitive programs.",

METHODS: This study is a systematic review and meta-analysis, including 16 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs), encompassing a total of 1948 participants. The sample sizes of the included studies ranged from 32 to 210, with results from 1852 participants being evaluated. Potential studies up to July 31, 2023, were searched across seven electronic literature databases, reference lists of similar reviews, gray literature, and the Clinical Trials Registry. Studies were required to meet the PICOS inclusion criteria. Two independent investigators assessed the risk of bias in the included studies using the Cochrane Collaboration Tool. Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.4 when data were available. This review is registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) with the registration number CRD42024524176 (28/03/2024). RESULTS: This meta-analysis included 16 articles; nine studies found that reminiscence therapy significantly reduced the anxiety scores with a standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.80 (95% CI - 1.15, - 0.44) and depression scores with an SMD of 0.67 (95% CI - 0.94, - 0.4) (p < 0.001). In four studies, reminiscence therapy significantly improved quality of life with an SMD of 0.37 (95% CI 0.18, 0.56) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Reminiscence therapy can be used by nurses as a nonpharmacological intervention to reduce anxiety and depression and improve quality of life in cancer patients during treatment, rehabilitation, and end-of-life periods. Further studies are needed as there is no standard for the duration and frequency of sessions.",

This meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively evaluate the effect of a reminiscence therapy-involved program (RTIP) on anxiety, depression, and quality of life in cancer patients. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in the Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases until December 2023 to screen randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing the effect of RTIP and control care. RESULTS: A total of 16 RCTs published from 2013 to 2023 were included, with 1,963 cancer patients undergoing RTIP with or without control care (RTIP group, N = 984) or control care (control group, N = 979). The results showed the the anxiety score [standardized mean differences (SMD) = -0.539; 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.700, -0.378; P < 0.001], anxiety rate [relative risk (RR) = 0.736; 95% CI: 0.627, 0.865; P < 0.001], depression score (SMD = -0.664; 95% CI: -0.967, -0.361; P < 0.001), and depression rate (RR = 0.632; 95% CI = 0.532, 0.750; P < 0.001) were significantly reduced in the RTIP group compared to the control group. Furthermore, overall quality of life was increased in the RTIP group than in the control group (SMD = 0.501; 95% CI: 0.314, 0.689; P < 0.001). In digestive system cancer patients, anxiety/depression scores and rates were reduced, and the overall quality of life was elevated in the RTIP group in comparison with the control group (all P < 0.050). The quality of evidence was generally high, with a low risk of bias in most studies and no publication bias in any outcomes (all P > 0.050). CONCLUSION: RTIP attenuates anxiety and depression and improves the quality of life in cancer patients, benefitting their overall health condition.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of group reminiscence therapy on cognitive function, subjective well-being, and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in older adults with moderate to severe dementia. A pre-post comparative design was used, with 49 participants receiving eight group reminiscence therapy sessions over 4 weeks. Baseline, one-week, and one-month postintervention assessments were conducted using the Hasegawa Dementia Scale-Revised (HDS-R), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home Version (NPI-NH), and the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale (PGC Morale Scale). The results showed no significant improvement in HDS-R scores, but significant improvements in PGC Morale Scale (p = 0.0417) and NPI-NH scores (p = 0.00226), indicating improved well-being and reduced BPSD. These findings suggest that group reminiscence therapy is effective in improving BPSD. Future research should focus on extending the duration of the intervention, including different populations, and combining group reminiscence therapy with other therapeutic approaches to fully determine its long-term benefits and mechanisms. Research on its cost-effectiveness and cultural applicability could further validate and improve the use of group reminiscence therapy in diverse care settings."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Stroke is a common cause of death and disability in the older adult and increases the risk and severity of cognitive impairment, which is a factor for long-term death among stroke survivors. Some studies have focused on the effects of reminiscence therapy with different media on stroke survivors. It is currently unclear which is the best medium. This protocol aims to deal with this problem by using a network meta-analysis. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Published randomised controlled trials will be included if reminiscence therapy plus usual care was applied in older adult patients who had a stroke in the experimental group and usual care was applied in the control group. Six electronic databases will be searched from their inception to August 2023, including the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline and Embase. The media of reminiscence therapy may include (but not restricted to) old photos, music or movies. Outcomes will be cognitive function and negative moods. Study selection, data extraction and quality assessment will be performed independently by two reviewers. The risk of bias (RoB) of the included studies will be evaluated in accordance with the Cochrane Collaboration's RoB tool. The evidence quality will be measured based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. To compare the efficacy of reminiscence therapy with different media, standard pairwise meta-analysis and Bayesian network meta-analysis will be conducted. The probabilities of intervention for all outcomes will be ranked based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required for reviewing published studies. The findings will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for review and publication to provide important evidence for clinicians and guideline developers to determine interventions for older adult patients who had a stroke.

      "abstract": "Dementia is characterized by a progressive decline in cognition, behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPSD), and quality of life (QoL). The lack of curative therapies has led to a psychosocial discourse prioritizing QoL of people thriving with dementia (PTD). Group reminiscence therapy (RT) is a relatively inexpensive intervention, with music prompts being a preferred choice, owing to robust musical memory in the early disease stage. However, a synthesis of current evidence is needed to inform research and clinical use of group music RT in dementia care. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review on PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, APA PsycInfo, and APA PsycArticles to critically appraise published randomized controlled trials examining group music RT to improve cognition, BPSD, and QoL in PTD. Of 14,725 articles, two RCTs involving 102 PTD were included. All studies used prerecorded music for group music RT. All studies were deemed of good quality, adhering to intention-to-treat analysis and assessor blinding. Based on the American Academy of Neurology guidelines, we assigned a Level C recommendation for group music RT for cognition and Level B recommendations for BPSD and QoL (ineffective). In conclusion, group music RT may be useful for symptomatic management in PTD. However, heterogeneous study designs, disease severity, dementia subtype, and outcome measures are likely barriers to meaningful clinical translation. Therefore, the rating of recommendations only serves as a point of reference. Future avenues include live performances as prompts for group music RT."

OBJECTIVE: This review aims to identify (1) the design characteristics of conducting a VR-RT and (2) the effects of VR-RT on the user experience, cognitive outcomes and psychological well-being. DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: Eligible studies were sourced across nine electronic databases, trial registries, grey literature and hand-searching of the reference list. A narrative synthesis was conducted. Twenty-two studies were included, and most were appraised as high quality. Most of the VR-RTs were highly immersive and personalised, with participants having the autonomy of control. VR-RT has the potential to improve anxiety and depression, and cognitive outcomes for older adults. Overall, VR-RT was reported to be an enjoyable experience for older adults. CONCLUSIONS: VR-RT is a promising innovation that can improve older adults' psychological well-being and cognition without significant side effects, including cybersickness and with the potential for scalability across various settings. More randomised controlled studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of VR-RT and its features and treatment dosage. These studies could also examine the effectiveness of VR-RT as an intervention to promote independence in activities of daily living and physical rehabilitation. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: VR-RT is a promising intervention for older adults in community settings to enhance psychological well-being and cognition. VR's versatility enables personalised experiences within dynamic virtual environments, possibly enhancing engagement and therapeutic outcomes. NO PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: This systematic review did not directly involve patient or public contribution to the manuscript."

      "abstract": "Reminiscence therapy (RT) is an effective psychological intervention to address mental disorders in the elderly; however, it is insufficiently appraised in elderly postoperative cervical cancer patients complicated with anxiety or depression. Hence, this study aimed to explore the effect of RT-engaged care (RTEC) on this population. Totally, 112 elderly postoperative cervical cancer patients with anxiety or depression were enrolled in this single-center, randomized, controlled study, and randomized into RTEC group (N = 56) or usual care group (N = 56) for a 12-week intervention. Evaluations were performed at baseline and the 4 th week (W4), 8th week (W8), and 12th week (W12) after intervention initiation.Hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS)-anxiety score at W12 (P = 0.028) as well as HADS-depression score at W8 (P = 0.028) and W12 (P = 0.017) were reduced in RTEC group compared to usual care group. However, the mini-mental state examination score at W4, W8, and W12 was not different between the two groups (all P > 0.050). Concerning quality of life (QoL), EuroQol 5-dimensions score at W12 was reduced in RTEC group than in usual care group (P = 0.010). Both quality of life questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) global-health-status score and QLQ-C30 function score at W8 and W12 were elevated in RTEC group compared to usual care group (all P < 0.050). Whereas no difference was seen in QLQ-C30 symptom score at these timepoints between the two groups (all P > 0.050). In conclusion, RTEC alleviates psychological burden and improves QoL in elderly postoperative cervical cancer patients with anxiety or depression, while the effect in enhancing cognitive function is not obvious.",

Although the results indicated positive correlations between alpha and beta waves, suggesting enhanced relaxation and cognitive engagement, improvements in Hasegawa Dementia Scale-Revised scores were not statistically significant, pointing to variability in therapeutic effectiveness among patients. Despite these mixed outcomes, the findings support the potential of reminiscence therapy as a non-pharmacological intervention to improve the quality of life of dementia patients, though they also underscore the necessity for further research to refine therapy protocols and enhance applicability."

This study was conducted to examine the effect of individual reminiscence therapy on cognitive level, quality of life and depressive symptoms in older adults with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This study is an experimental type, randomised controlled study designed in pre-test - post-test design. The sample size of the study consisted of 58 older adults with type 2 diabetes, consisting of 29 intervention and 29 control subjects. The older adults in the intervention group were individually subjected to 5 weeks of reminiscence therapy in two sessions (each session 40-45 min) per week. No intervention was applied to the control group. Personal Information Form, Standardised Mini Mental Test, SF-36 Quality of Life and Beck Depression Inventory were used to collect the data. RESULTS: While there was no significant difference between the pre-test Mini Mental Test, Beck Depression Inventory total score and SF-36 Quality of Life Scale mental and physical health sub-dimension mean scores of the older adults in the intervention group and the mean scores of those in the control group (P > 0.05), the difference between the Mini Mental Test, Beck Depression Inventory total score and SF-36 Quality of Life Scale mental and physical health sub-dimension mean scores of the older adults in the intervention and control groups in the post-test was found to be statistically significant (P < 0.05). The post-test Mini Mental Test total score, SF-36 Quality of Life Scale mental and physical health sub-dimension mean scores of the older adults in the intervention group were higher than the older adults in the control group. It was determined that the post-test Beck Depression Inventory total mean scores of the older adults in the intervention group were lower than the older adults in the control group. CONCLUSION: Reminiscence therapy can positively affect cognitive levels, quality of life and depression symptoms of older adults living in the community. Individual reminiscence therapy can be used as a nursing intervention in primary healthcare.",

METHODS: In a single-center palliative care service in western Turkey, 48 patients without cognitive impairment and able to communicate were included in the study. However, 44 patients completed the study. Patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to the reminiscence therapy (intervention), unstructured social interviewing (placebo), and control groups (16 people for each group) before the start of the study. The sessions for the interview and placebo groups were conducted face-to-face in the patient's room (while the patient was sitting or lying down) for 15 days (2 weeks), every other day, for a total of eight sessions (each session was approximately 30 min). Data collection instruments-the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale, the Contentment with Life Assessment Scale, and the Self-Transcendence Scale-were collected at baseline (first day) and after the intervention (day 15th). Statistical significance level was accepted as p < 0.05. RESULTS: There was no decrease in physical and total symptom burden (p > 0.05). There were significant reductions in general distress and psychological symptoms in the intervention and placebo groups within the group (p < 0.05), but there were no significant differences between the control group and all groups when compared (p > 0.05). Group × time interactions were statistically significant for life satisfaction and self-transcendence (p < 0.001), and there was a substantial increase in the intervention group compared to the other groups. CONCLUSION: It may be recommended that reminiscence therapy intervention be included in routine nursing care as it may contribute positively to the psychological recovery of palliative care patients approaching the end of life.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of RT on anxiety, depression, spiritual well-being, and quality of life in elderly patients with unresectable, metastatic gastrointestinal cancer. A total of 222 elderly patients with unresectable, metastatic gastrointestinal cancer were randomized into RT group (RT plus usual care, n=112) or control group (usual care, n=110) with a 6-month intervention. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale for Anxiety (HADS-A) and Depression (HADS-D), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being Scale (FACIT-Sp), and Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) were evaluated at month (M)0, M1, M3, and M6. Concerning the primary outcome, HADS-A score at M6 decreased in the RT group compared to the control group (P=0.005). As to secondary outcomes, the RT group showed decreased HADS-A scores at M3, anxiety rate at M3, HADS-D scores at M3 and M6, depression rate at M6, as well as greater FACIT-Sp scores at M1, M3, and M6 vs the control group (all P<0.050). Additionally, QLQ-C30 global health score was elevated at M1 (P=0.046) and M6 (P=0.005), functions score was greater at M6 (P=0.038), and symptoms score was lower at M3 (P=0.019) in the RT group than in the control group. Subgroup analysis revealed that the addition of RT was more effective for patients with anxiety or depression at baseline. In summary, RT alleviated anxiety and depression, and improved the spiritual well-being and quality of life within 6 months in elderly patients with unresectable, metastatic gastrointestinal cancer.",

This study aimed to replicate the effects of a three-session, group-based, positive-memory version of cognitive-reminiscence therapy (CRT) on psychological resources and mental well-being and extend the findings to anticipated pleasure. The participants (N = 75, Mage = 43.7 (SD = 16.7), 60% females) were randomised to CRT or control group. Anticipated pleasure, psychological resources (schemas of positive self-esteem, self-efficacy, meaning in life, optimism), mental well-being (depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms) and theorised change processes (automatic negative thoughts, awareness of narrative identity) were assessed. Relative to the control group, the CRT group reported significantly higher anticipated pleasure (d = 0.76-0.93) and psychological resources of self-esteem, self-efficacy, and optimism (d's = 0.58-0.99) at post-CRT and follow-up, and lower depressive symptoms post-CRT and at follow-up (d = 0.56-0.67). Findings on meaning in life and negative automatic thinking were partially replicated. This study replicates findings of the effectiveness of this intervention for improving psychological resources such as self-worth, confidence and optimism and depressive symptoms, and indicates additional effects on anticipated pleasure. CRT may serve as a standalone intervention, or as an adjunct \"memory booster\" for interventions focused on future thinking and related anticipated reward.",

      "abstract": "Background: Anxiety and loneliness are prevalent psychological issues faced by older adults. To tackle these concerns, group reminiscence therapy has been widely recognized as an effective non-pharmacological form of intervention. Despite its proven efficacy, the implementation of this therapy normally requires professional guidance, limiting its accessibility to specialized institutions such as hospitals. Objective: In this study, the objective is to empirically validate the effectiveness of a reminiscence therapy-based hybrid board game, Journey of Memories, in reducing anxiety and loneliness among older adults. Method: We conducted a 12-day randomized controlled study. A total of 38 elderly participants aged between 61 and 75 were recruited. They were randomly assigned to an experimental group (consisting of 20 individuals) and a control group (consisting of 18 individuals). Participants in the experimental group were required to engage in three sessions of the Journey of Memories hybrid board game intervention, with a 5-day interval between each session. No intervention was administered to participants in the control group. Results: The results found that after 3 sessions of board game-based reminiscence therapy, 20 participants in the experimental group showed significant reductions in anxiety levels (the State Anxiety subscale of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI-S] average scores decreased from 43.83 to 41.05, P = 0.000, the Trait Anxiety subscale State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI-T] average scores decreased from 46.72 to 43.61, P = 0.030) and loneliness levels (UCLA Loneliness Scale [UCLA] average scores decreased from 39.11 to 36.11, P = 0.002). In addition, participants reported high scores of usability (3.77/5) and user experience (4.08/5). Conclusion: These results demonstrate that the hybrid board game can effectively reduce older adults' feelings of anxiety and loneliness while providing a satisfactory user experience, motivating them to participate in group reminiscence therapy.",

The data collection tools included the Geriatric Depression Scale and Adult Hope Scale. For the intervention group, SRT was conducted in six weekly sessions, each lasting 60 to 90 min, over six weeks. The data were analyzed utilizing descriptive statistics and inferential tests (independent t-test, Chi-square test, and analysis of covariance). The two groups' post-intervention mean scores on depression (t= 11.63 and P< 0.001), and hope (t= 4.41 and P< 0.001) were statistically different, suggesting that SRT positively affected older adults by alleviating despair and boosting hope.

Learning resourcefulness and instrumental reminiscence may contribute to the psychological adjustment made by nursing home residents. How both attributes can be combined to enhance residents' adjustment remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: This study examined the effects of resourcefulness-based instrumental reminiscence therapy (RBIRT) on psychological adjustment, learned resourcefulness, self-efficacy, social support and quality of life (QoL) of nursing home residents. METHODS: A randomised, controlled, assessor-blinded, parallel-arm trial was conducted between January 2022 and February 2023 in Fujian, China, with 120 participants (intervention = 60, comparison = 60) from two separate nursing homes. The intervention group participants received a 6-week RBIRT, involving Reminiscence Interview, Emotional Venting, Reconstruction Strategies, Planning for the Future and Strengthening Support. The control group participants received routine institutional care. Participants were assessed using the Nursing Home Adjustment Scale, Resourcefulness Scale, General Self-efficacy Scale, Perceived Social Support Scale and the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey. Outcomes were evaluated at baseline (T0), immediately post intervention (T1) and at 1-month (T2) and 3-months (T3) post-intervention. RESULTS: Participants in the intervention group showed significant improvement in 'psychological adjustment,' 'learned resourcefulness,' 'self-efficacy,' 'social support' and 'QoL-mental health dimension' compared to the control group (P < 0.001). These effects were sustained at the 1- and 3-month follow-ups. CONCLUSIONS: Innovative RBIRT improved psychological adjustment, learned resourcefulness, self-efficacy, social support and mental health-related QoL among nursing home residents.",

METHODS: In this quasi-experimental study, we randomly allocated 152 PwGC who met the inclusion criteria as 1:1 ratio to control (N = 76) and intervention (N = 76) groups. The patients in the control group received routine post-chemotherapy care, while those in the intervention group received reminiscence therapy over the phone in addition to routine care. The participants of both groups completed Beck's Depression Inventory and Zung's Self-rating Anxiety Scale before the study, 6 weeks after the beginning of the study, and 3 months after the intervention. RESULTS: Although the mean depression score before chemotherapy indicated moderate depression in both groups, the reminiscence therapy group showed a significant reduction in the depression score compared to the control group (P < 0.001) following intervention. The mean anxiety scores indicated mild to moderate anxiety in both groups, which was later placed within the normal range, there was a significant difference between the two groups. Intra-group comparison revealed that the mean depression and anxiety scores decreased significantly in the reminiscence therapy group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study indicated that virtual reminiscence therapy can decrease anxiety and depression in PwGC undergoing chemotherapy.

Despite many older adults with dementia receiving long-term care (LTC), few studies have been conducted in Turkey on reminiscence therapy (RT) influencing neuropsychiatric symptoms and quality of life in people with dementia receiving LTC. This study aimed to investigate the effect of RT on cognition, agitation, and quality of life in older adults with dementia receiving LTC in Turkey. METHODS: The study population consisted of 100 older adults living in a LTC centre in a province. The size of the research group was calculated using the power analysis method, and 54 older adults were included in the study, 27 each in the RT and control (C) groups. Data collection forms Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), and the Alzheimer's Disease Quality-of-Life Scale (AD-QOL) were applied to the RT and C groups before RT (T0 ), 1 week after RT (T1 ), 1 month after RT (T2 ), and 3 months after RT (T3 ) to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. Mean, standard deviation, ratio, percentile, Fisher's exact test, Pearson Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and Friedman test were used in analyzing the data. RESULTS: Older adults in the RT and C groups were similar regarding sociodemographic characteristics, institutional care, and life models (P > 0.05). When comparing the T3 values of MMSE, CMAI, and AD-QOL total scores with the T0 values, a significant difference was observed between the groups, favouring the RT group (P < 0.001).

The objective of this study is to assess the differential improvement of the quality of life for older people in different vital situations (three different types of aging) and from different countries by implementing a positive reminiscence therapy program (REMPOS). METHODS: The participants were 144 older adults above the age of 65, 77 participants from Spain (45 experimental groups, 32 control groups) and 67 from Mexico (34 experimental groups, 33 control groups). The participants were recruited from nursing and retirement homes. A factorial randomized design with pre-post measurement with three independent variables: country (Mexico, Spain), condition (experimental, control), and types of aging (healthy aging, HA., mild cognitive impairment, MCI., Alzheimer's disease, AD). The experimental groups received REMPOS therapy and control groups received standard cognitive stimulation program. The quality of life was measured with the Life Satisfaction Inventory for adults (LSI-A) and autobiographical memory test (AMT) before and after REMPOS therapy. RESULTS: The REMPOS intervention showed significantly higher positive effects than the control condition on the recall of specific positive memories across countries and types of aging, except for the Spanish MCI group. Life satisfaction in the Alzheimer's and MCI group only improved with REMPOS in the Mexican sample. CONCLUSIONS: The REMPOS effects showed generalizable effects across countries, but the cross-cultural differences shown highlight the necessity of running studies to test those differential effects.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Reminiscence therapy (RT), which engages individuals to evoke positive memories, has been shown to be effective in improving psychological well-being in older adults suffering from PTSD, depression, and anxiety. However, its impact on brain function has yet to be determined. This paper presents functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to describe changes in autobiographical memory networks (AMN) in community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: This pilot study used a within-subject design to measure changes in AMN activation in 11 older adults who underwent 6 weeks of RT. In the scanner, participants retrieved autobiographical memories which were either recent or remote, rehearsed or unrehearsed. Participants also underwent a clinical interview to assess changes in memory, quality of life, mental health, and affect. FINDINGS: Compared to pretreatment, anxiety decreased (z = -2.014, p = .040) and activated significant areas within the AMN, including bilateral medial prefrontal cortex, left precuneus, right occipital cortex, and left anterior hippocampus. CONCLUSION: Although RT had subtle effects on psychological function in this sample with no evidence of impairments, including depression at baseline, the fMRI data support current thinking of the effect RT has on the AMN. Increased activation of right posterior hippocampus following RT is compatible with the Multiple Trace Theory Theory (Nadel & Moscovitch, 1997).",

Experimental groups of older adults significantly improved their quality of life (SMD 1.07; 95% CI 0.48 to 1.66; p < 0.001) and life satisfaction (SMD 1.12; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.60; p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed that individual sessions of life review and reminiscence therapy had a more significant impact on improving quality of life and six to eight intervention sessions could enhance life satisfaction more effectively. CONCLUSIONS: Life review and reminiscence therapy hold promise for application in medical and nursing care for older adults, suggesting the potential benefits of implementing intervention designs with effective settings for positive psychological functions."

A randomized design with pre-posttest measurement and twelve groups was formulated, during a period of six months of intervention (3 in Mexico and 3 in Spain). The design had: 6 experimental groups with REMPOS intervention (3 in Mexico and 3 in Spain) during a period of six months and 6 control groups that received cognitive stimulation.While a key aspect of this study is the cross-cultural differences, an important part is to determine whether each experimental group had similar results in terms of the change in magnitude between the pre and post analysis. In general, intervention significantly improved cognitive function and decreased depressive symptoms.These findings provide further evidence about the efficacy of the REMPOS therapy between different types of aging and both geographical and cultural contexts (Spain and Mexico).",

We report on the evaluation of a cultural adaptation of the RT intervention that combines reminiscence with three innovative elements: including family members in RT; conducting community events for participants to present their artwork and life-story books created during the intervention; and using ethnically matched bilingual community workers. The 12-week intervention with pre- and post-test assessments was completed by 73 Hispanic and 92 Vietnamese elders (mean age  =  75 years; 62% female; mostly foreign-born, with limited English proficiency). Paired t-tests indicated statistically significant improvement in depression, loneliness, and life satisfaction. Sixty-two percent of participants noted improved relationships with family/friends through improved communication and shared understanding of the participant's life story. Fifty percent of respondents participated in a community event and the qualitative comments noted improved connection with their community through listening to others' life experiences and sharing their own. Participant perceptions of ethnically matched community workers were positive, but several indicated they could work with someone from a different ethnic background. Similar to general RT findings, the culturally adapted RT intervention demonstrated improvement in depression, loneliness, and life satisfaction among elders from two different ethnic backgrounds. Implications for future projects are discussed based on the findings and experience of conducting this intervention.",

The study identified five major barriers, including the lack of on-boarding/educational training, need for technology availability and technical support, limited attention span of persons with dementia (PWD), availability of multi-sensory features, and time constraints due to staff workload. Seven major themes emerged related to proposed solutions/suggestions: (1) involving younger generations, (2) focusing on technology training, (3) integrating with other digital platforms, (4) adding narratives/descriptions to recollect memories, (5) ensuring accessibility, (6) adding QR codes for retrieving information, and (7) combining digital/traditional reminiscence methods. These findings provide valuable insights for implementing WBRT to facilitate dementia care and for the future refinement of its application.",

Thus, this randomized, controlled study intended to investigate the influence of RT on anxiety, depression, and spiritual well-being in these individuals. METHODS: Totally, 162 couples of stroke patients and their spouse caregivers were randomly assigned to receive RT (N = 81) and control care (CC) (N = 81) by pairs 4 times per month for 6 months. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale for anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Spiritual Well-being scale (FACIT-Sp) were evaluated at month (M)0, M1, M3, and M6. RESULTS: In stroke patients, RT reduced HADS-A score at M3 (P = 0.043) and M6 (P = 0.020), and HADS-D score at M6 (P = 0.034), while increased FACIT-Sp score at M1 (P = 0.023), M3 (P = 0.010), and M6 (P = 0.004) compared to CC. Meanwhile, RT induced greater ameliorations in HADS-A (P = 0.049) and FACIT-Sp (P < 0.001) scores from M0 to M6 versus CC, but less in HADS-D score (P = 0.076). In the aspect of spouse caregivers, RT deceased HADS-A score at M1 (P = 0.042), M3 (P = 0.001), and M6 (P < 0.001), lowered HADS-D score at M3 (P = 0.015) and M6 (P = 0.001), but elevated FACIT-Sp score at M1 (P = 0.042), M3 (P < 0.001), and M6 (P < 0.001) compared to CC. Noteworthily, RT facilitated the improvements of HADS-A (P < 0.001), HADS-D (P = 0.010), and FACIT-Sp (P < 0.001) scores from M0 to M6 versus CC.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Reminiscence therapy is known as an effective intervention method for elderly with various health conditions. This study was to provide basic data for contributing to the spread and development of effective intervention by analyzing the characteristics and effects of reminiscence therapy applied to the elderly at home. METHODS: To select the article to be studied, literature published from January 2000 to January 2021 was searched through eight databases. A total of 897 articles were searched, and the collected papers were analyzed using the flow chart of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). Of these, 6 articles suitable for the selection criteria were selected by reviewing titles and abstracts, excluding duplicate papers, using EndNote X9 and Excel 2013. The quality of literature was evaluated using the critical appraisal checklist of the Joanna Briggs Institute. RESULTS: For the characteristics of the selected literature, most of the literature published within the last 10 years was conducted, and the research design was conducted only in experimental research. The most common form of reminiscence therapy was group reminiscence, and the type was 'simple reminiscence'. The intervention method of reminiscence therapy was provided in various ways, but 'Sharing' was mainly used, and the representative topic of recall was 'Hometown'. Most of the intervention was performed less than 10 times and took about 60 min. CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, reminiscence therapy provided to the elderly living in the community was effective in improving their quality of life and life satisfaction. Therefore, it is suggested that reminiscence therapy can be an intervention method that is helpful for positive psychological factors and health promotion by improving the quality of life and life satisfaction of the elderly living in the community, and further, it is considered that the elderly can contribute to non-pharmacologically healthy aging in the community.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Geriatric depression has become a serious public health problem, and reduced autobiographical memory and increased overgeneral memory, as the main cognitive markers of depression, are not only associated with current depressive symptoms but also associated with the onset and course of depression, which can lead to a range of harms. Economic and effective psychological interventions are urgently needed. The aim of this study is to confirm the effectiveness of reminiscence therapy combined with memory specificity training in improving autobiographical memory and depressive symptoms in older adults. METHODS: In this multicentre, single-blind, three-arm parallel randomized controlled study, we aim to enrol 78 older adults aged 65 years or older with a score of ≥ 11 on the Geriatric Depression Scale, and participants will be randomly assigned to either a reminiscence therapy group, a reminiscence therapy with memory specificity training group or a usual care group. Assessments will be conducted at baseline (T0) as well as immediately post-intervention (T1) and 1 (T2), 3 (T3) and 6 (T4) months post-intervention. The primary outcome measure is self-reported depressive symptoms, measured using the GDS. Secondary outcome measures include measures of autobiographical memory, rumination, and social engagement. DISCUSSION: We believe that the intervention will play a positive role in improving autobiographical memory and depressive symptoms in older adults. Poor autobiographical memory is a predictor of depression and a major cognitive marker, and improving autobiographical memory is of great significance in alleviating depressive symptoms in older people. If our program is effective, it will provide a convenient and feasible strategy for further promoting healthy ageing. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ChiCTR2200065446.",

Cognitive-reminiscence therapy is one of the most effective psychosocial methods for managing cognitive errors. This study aimed to evaluate cognitive reminiscence therapy's feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness among Jordanian patients with major depressive disorder. A convergent-parallel design was employed. A convenience sampling method was used to recruit 36 participants (Site 1: n = 16, Site 2: n = 20). A total of 31 participants were included in the analysis, divided into six groups, with 5-6 participants in each group. Cognitive-reminiscence therapy included eight supported sessions of up to 2 h each, delivered over 4 wk. Recruitment, adherence, retention, and attrition rates of 80%, 86.1%, and 13.9%, respectively, indicated the feasibility of the therapy. The acceptability of therapy was reflected in the following four themes: Positive Cognitive Reminiscence Therapy Perspectives and Outcomes; Cognitive Reminiscence Therapy Sessions Challenge; Suggestions for Improving Cognitive Reminiscence Therapy Sessions; and Motivational Home Activities. A significant reduction in the mean of depressive symptoms and negative automatic thoughts and a significant increase in the self-transcendence mean demonstrated the effectiveness of the intervention. The study's results suggest that cognitive reminiscence therapy is feasible and acceptable among patients with major depressive disorder. This therapy is a promising nursing intervention to reduce depressive symptoms and negative automatic thoughts and increase self-transcendence for those patients.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Reminiscence therapy has been a high-benefit and low-cost measure of psychosocial intervention for older adults in recent years. It has attracted much attention in the intervention study of older adults without obvious cognitive impairment. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of reminiscence therapy on psychosocial outcomes among older adults without obvious cognitive impairment and analyze the divergences of different intervention programs (form, duration, and setting) on outcomes. METHODS: We searched the commonly used databases and used RevMan 5.4 in the meta-analysis (PROSPERO-ID: CRD42022315237). All eligible trials used the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the Effective Public Health Practice Project quality assessment tool to identify the quality and determine the bias risk grade. RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies were included, involving 1,755 older adults. Meta-analysis showed that reminiscence therapy has a significant effect on both depression and life satisfaction. Group reminiscence played a significant role in improving life satisfaction. Depression symptoms were not affected by the intervention duration (P = 0.06), while life satisfaction was significantly improved after more than 8 weeks of intervention (P < 0.00001). Intervention settings drove differences in depressive symptoms (P = 0.02), and the effect size of the community was larger. CONCLUSION: Reminiscence therapy can significantly reduce depressive symptoms and improve life satisfaction. There are different effects of reminiscence therapy in different intervention schemes on psychological outcomes among older adults. More well-designed trials with large sample sizes and long-term follow-ups are necessary to confirm and expand the present results.

METHODS: A qualitative phenomenological descriptive study was adopted and guided by Graham's Knowledge to Action framework. Online training on the use of WBRT was conducted, followed by interviews with HCPs. RESULTS: Four major themes were identified on the potential use of WBRT in dementia care, including usability and efficacy, impact on caregiving, capability of reducing BPSD, and. feasibility during COVID-19 social distancing. DISCUSSION: This study recognized the potential use of WBRT to support the person with dementia during the pandemic in institutionalized settings.

      "abstract": "Background: Mindfulness trainings have shown promising results as treatment for behavioural symptoms in several pathologies. In addition, mindfulness protocols induced an improvement in memory and attention. Therefore, mindfulness could be an effective intervention for patients affected by Parkinson's disease (PD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), who are characterized by both behavioural and cognitive dysfunctions. Methods: We assessed differences in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores and in Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) scores in patients affected by PD and MCI enrolled in two different rehabilitation programs (an experimental vs. an usual structured program for cognitive rehabilitation). Participants in the experimental group (MILC-tr) underwent innovative rehabilitation program involving mindfulness and reminiscence activities. Assessments were performed before (T0) and at the end of the rehabilitation program (T1). Results: Friedman test showed a significant improvement between timepoints in MoCA global score (x2 = 4.000, p = 0.046), MoCA memory sub-scale score (x2 = 4.571, p = 0.033), and BDI-II cognitive and affective factors (x2 = 4.000, p = 0.046) only for patients in MILC-tr group.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Reminiscence therapy (RT) is frequently used with elderly patients to improve their psychological status, but a few studies have examined its application in lung cancer patients. This study explored whether a reminiscence therapy-involved care program (RTICP) could improve cognitive functions, anxiety, depression, patient satisfaction, and survival in elderly lung cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized, controlled study enrolled 138 elderly post-operative lung cancer patients into two groups, an RTICP group (n = 69) and a usual care program (UCP) group (n = 69), for a 12-month intervention period and a follow-up period. During the 12-month intervention, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale for anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D), patient satisfaction, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. RESULTS: MMSE and patient satisfaction were elevated in the RTICP group compared to the UCP group at month (M) 12. Additionally, RTICP reduced HADS-A at M6, M9, and M12 and the anxiety rate at M9, HADS-D at M9, and M12 compared to UCP, whereas the depression rate was no different between the two groups at any time (all P > 0.050). Moreover, DFS and OS were no different between the two groups (all P > 0.050). CONCLUSION: RTICP, considered as an optional psychological intervention, enhances cognitive functions, alleviates anxiety and depression feelings, and elevates satisfaction among elderly lung cancer patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: At present, simple reminiscence has been widely used in the field of neurocognitive disorders, life review/life review therapy has been widely used in the field of cancer, and both simple reminiscence and life review/life review therapy are suitable for psychological disorders such as depression and anxiety. However, the efficacy of reminiscence in treating cancer-related symptom has not been fully assessed. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of reminiscence therapy (RT) on relieving cancer-related symptoms such as anxiety and depression in cancer survivals. METHODS: China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP database, Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, China Biomedical Database, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, EBSCO, Scopus, and Ovid databases were searched. To collect clinical randomized controlled trials (RCT) on RT and cancer-related studies published from the establishment of the database to October 05, 2021. Two researchers independently evaluated the articles that met the inclusion criteria, meta-analysis was performed using RevMan5.4 software. RESULTS: A total of 20 RCTs published in 2010 to 2021 were included, with a total of 1853 cancer patients. Meta-analysis results showed that the anxiety scale (HADS-A and HAMA and SAS) and depression scale (HADS-D and HAMD and SDS) scores of the RT group were significantly lower than those of the control group (HADS-A: P = .0002; HAMA: P < .00001; SAS: P = .0010; HADS-D: P = .01; HAMD: P < .00001; SDS: P = .0001). Meta-analysis results showed that RT can improve overall quality of life of cancer patients of RT group to a certain extent hope (P < .00001). Meta-analysis results showed that the scores on the hope and dignity were significantly increased, and the difference were statistically significant (P < .001). CONCLUSION: This review indicates that RT has significant efficacy on cancer-related symptoms such as anxiety and depression. RT for cancer survivals can effectively improve quality of life, self-hope, and self-esteem. The findings of this meta-analysis can provide direction for future symptom management research.",

However, no study reports its effect on older papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) patients. This study intended to investigate the effect of the RT-care program (CP) on anxiety, depression, quality of life, and survival in older PTC patients. METHODS: Eighty-six postoperative older PTC patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to RT-CP group (N = 44) and usual (U)-CP group (N = 42) as a 1:1 ratio for a 6-month intervention. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) scores were assessed at baseline, month (M)1, M2, M4, and M6. RESULTS: HADS and QLQ-C30 scores at baseline were not different between two groups. Additionally, HADS-anxiety score at M6 (p = 0.029), and HADS-depression score at M2 (p = 0.030), M4 (p = 0.029), M6 (p = 0.012) were reduced in RT-CP group versus U-CP group. Meanwhile, anxiety and depression rates from M1 to M6 were slightly decreased in RT-CP group versus U-CP group but did not reach statistical significance. Furthermore, depression severity at M6 was reduced in RT-CP group versus U-CP group (p = 0.049). Besides, QLQ-C30 global health status was increased at M2 (p = 0.023) and M6 (p = 0.033), QLQ-C30 function score was elevated at M2 (p = 0.040) and M4 (p = 0.035), while QLQ-C30 symptom score was decreased at M2 (p = 0.046) in RT-CP group versus U-CP group. Moreover, disease-free survival and overall survival were not different between two groups. CONCLUSION: RT-CP may be a potential intervention for ameliorating anxiety, depression, and quality of life in older PTC patients."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Reminiscence therapy is a common psychosocial intervention in mental health nursing. Numerous secondary studies have explored the effects of reminiscence therapy interventions in older adults, and while the effects are significant, conflicting results remain. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: To date, research on reminiscence therapy has examined different disorders in isolation from one another. By illustrating the evidence gaps between studies, this paper highlights the need for a new evidence-based summary overview of reminiscence therapy research. The results suggest that reminiscence therapy can be beneficial to the improvement of mental health and quality of life for older people. However, we found that the secondary studies were not of high quality and that further high-quality literature supporting the evidence is still needed. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE?: Reminiscence therapy may be considered a useful non-pharmacological intervention for older people with mental and psychological problems. However, there is a lack of normative guidelines for reminiscence therapy in terms of intervention time, frequency, and form. The development of a global standard protocol for the application of reminiscence therapy may be necessary for future randomized controlled trials (RCTs). ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Reminiscence therapy is an alternative to pharmaceutical intervention provided during long-term care, especially for older people with mental and psychological problems. However, the effects of reminiscence therapy remain inconclusive. AIM: The present study aimed to systematically identify, synthesize and describe the research evidence and quality of systematic reviews (SRs) related to reminiscence interventions for older people through an evidence-mapping approach. METHODS: Commonly used English and Chinese databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI, WANFANG, VIP and SinoMed, were searched from inception till 31 March 2022. The study type was restricted to SRs with or without meta-analysis. The methodological quality of the included SRs was assessed by A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR-2). The Microsoft Excel 2019 tool was used for data extraction and coding, and bubble charts were used to synthesize information on the study population, intervention category, original study sample size and classification of findings. RESULTS: A total of 28 SRs were enrolled, including 514 original studies, 91.4% of which were randomized controlled trials. The main participants of the study were depressed older people (7 publications), older people with dementia (10 publications) and ordinary older people (8 publications). The findings of 26 (92.8%) publications were categorized as either \"beneficial\" or \"potentially beneficial.\" The primary outcome indicators of the effectiveness of the reminiscence intervention for older people are mental and psychological problems (especially depressive symptoms and cognitive functioning), quality of life and categories of positive psychology (e.g., life satisfaction, happiness and self-esteem). The main factors influencing the intervention effect were the intervention period, residential setting, intervention format (group/individual) and intervention intensity. The intervention settings/contexts were mainly community and long-term care facilities. However, the methodological quality of 27 (96.4%) of the SRs was scored as either \"Low\" or \"Critically Low.\" DISCUSSION: Reminiscence therapy has been used to study the mental health and quality of life of older people in various conditions, with significant results. However, due to the limited evidence included in the studies and the low methodological quality, there is still a need to focus on the issue of effectiveness and evidence gaps for different interventions in the field of recall in the future, in addition to efforts to improve the methodological quality and standardize the reporting process for the evaluation of reminiscence intervention systems. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Reminiscence therapy may be considered a useful non-pharmacological intervention for older people with mental and psychological problems. A standard protocol for reminiscence therapy may be necessary for future studies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Hospitalization due to acute illness in older patients is often associated with anxiety or depressive symptoms. In these circumstances, given that pharmacologic treatment should be avoided to reduce interactions with ongoing medication regimes, psychotherapy techniques should be considered. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of group reminiscence therapy (RT) on the reduction of anxiety and depressive symptoms in acutely hospitalized older patients. METHODS: Controlled and prospective study conducted on the Acute Geriatric Unit of a university hospital. Patients included in the intervention group (RT Group) attended a group session focused on RT, whereas those included in the control group (UC) received usual hospital care. Exclusion criteria were severe cognitive impairment, impossibility to mobilize, and clinical/hemodynamic instability. The intervention was based on a multi-task daily group session of reminiscence activities. The severity of anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, HAM-A), depressive symptoms (15-item Geriatric Depression Scale, GDS-15), loneliness (ESTE-II social loneliness scale), and fear of death (Collet-Lester scale) was assessed at admission and discharge in both groups. RESULTS: The intervention was effective in reducing the proportion of patients with anxiety and depressive symptoms during hospitalization. The proportion of patients with moderate-severe anxiety at discharge was 32.1% in the UC and 13.4% in the RT Group (p < 0.001), whereas the proportion of patients with depressive symptoms at discharge was 49.1% in the UC and 19.5% in the RT Group (p < 0.001). The intervention was independently associated with benefits on anxiety levels (RR 2.45, 95% CI 1.83-3.28) and depression (RR 3.71, 95% CI 2.22-6.19) at discharge. No differences were found in loneliness or fear of death. CONCLUSIONS: A group reminiscence activity reduces the proportion of patients with anxiety and depressive symptoms during hospitalization for an acute disease. Absolute changes in both anxiety and depression scores, even though significant, were relatively small.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) present with cognitive function deterioration, neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS)-especially depression-and low quality of life (QoL). Management of AD remains difficult, especially in the elderly. Reminiscence therapy (RT) is a well-known cognitive rehabilitation intervention that can be adopted in nursing and residential care homes to restore autobiographical memory, ameliorate NPS, and improve the QoL of people with dementia. However, the evidence-based efficacy of RT for elderly patients with AD remains to be determined. METHODS: Here, we synthesized findings of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) exploring the effects of RT on cognition, depression, and QoL in elderly people with AD, according to the most recent PRISMA statement. We searched for RCTs in PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and in trial registries (i.e., clinicaltrials.gov and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform of the World Health Organization). Two review authors extracted data of interest, with cognition, depression, and QoL measures as outcomes. RESULTS: A total of five articles were included in the final analysis. Findings globally showed that RT, both administered in individual or group sessions at least once a week for 30-35 min over a period of 12 weeks, is effective in supporting global cognition, ameliorating depression, and improving specific aspects of the QoL in elderly people with AD. CONCLUSIONS: RT has the potential to be a routine non-pharmacological therapy for elderly people with AD, thanks to its wider effects on the individual in terms of cognitive vitality and emotional status promotion, with positive implications for patient's daily life. Despite such evidences, caution should be used in findings' generalizability in relation to the paucity of existing RCTs with long-term follow-up."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Communication is essential for people with dementia (PWD) to independently perform activities of daily living. While cognitive training could improve communication abilities in PWD, there is limited evidence of the effect of reminiscence therapy (RT) on communication. Therefore, this study examines this effect, focusing on language features. METHOD: This study used data from randomised controlled trials applying RT to women with dementia registered in a day-care center. RT using digital material or storytelling was conducted with PWD for 4 weeks. Outcome measures included general characteristics and communicative ability, such as the number of correct information units (CIUs, a measure of informativeness in discourse), the Holden Communication Scale (HCS) score, and verbal engagement. Repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance and the paired t-test were performed to confirm the effect of RT on communicative ability. RESULTS: There was a significant change over time in the ratio of CIUs (F = 4.35, P = 0.016). In the first 2 weeks of the intervention, there were significant differences in the ratio of CIUs (t = -3.00, P = 0.005), total HCS score (t = 2.28, P = 0.028), and conversation score (HCS subdomain) (t = 2.44, P = 0.019) between two measurement time points (T0, T1), while the number of syllables did not significantly change (t = -1.60, P = 0.117). CONCLUSIONS: Informative/semantic linguistic ability was significantly increased in PWD, while the amount of discourse did not change after RT. This result may be helpful to improve effective communication with PWD and train healthcare staff working with PWD.",

However, its role in elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unclear. Thus, we aimed to detect the effect of reminiscence therapy on anxiety, depression, and the quality of life of elderly patients with HCC. METHODS: In total, 106 elderly patients with HCC after resection were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the reminiscence therapy group (N = 54) and control care group (N = 52) and then received intervention for 12 months. Anxiety and depression were evaluated by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at baseline [Month (M) 0], 3 months (M3), 6 months (M6), 9 months (M9), and 12 months (M12). Meanwhile, quality of life was assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) at M0, M6, and M12. RESULTS: The HADS for anxiety score at M9 (6.8 ± 2.3 vs. 7.8 ± 2.4, P = 0.039) and M12 (6.6 ± 2.4 vs. 7.8 ± 2.6, P = 0.013) and the anxiety proportion at M12 (27.8% vs. 46.2%, P = 0.050) were reduced in the reminiscence therapy group compared with those in the control care group. Moreover, the HADS for depression score declined at M9 (6.6 ± 2.0 vs. 7.5 ± 2.2, P = 0.025) and M12 (6.3 ± 2.3 vs. 7.7 ± 2.6, P = 0.005), but the proportion of those with depression was not different at each visit (P > 0.05) in the reminiscence therapy group compared with that of the control care group. In addition, the QLQ-C30 global health status score increased at M6 (71.3 ± 12.8 vs. 66.3 ± 12.9, P = 0.048) and M12 (74.5 ± 12.9 vs. 68.2 ± 13.3, P = 0.014) in the reminiscence therapy group compared to that in the control care group. CONCLUSION: Reminiscence therapy effectively mitigates anxiety and depression and improves the quality of life of elderly patients with HCC."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Reminiscence therapy provides benefits among first-episode acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients and their caregivers. This study intended to further compare the effect of reminiscence therapy plus usual care (RTUC) and usual care (UC) on cognitive function, anxiety, and depression among recurrent AIS patients. METHODS: Totally, 160 recurrent AIS patients were enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio into the RTUC group (N = 81) and UC group (N = 79), then a 12-month corresponding intervention was conducted in each group. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were evaluated on discharge (M0), at month (M) 3, M6, M9, and M12 after discharge. RESULTS: MMSE scores at M6 (27.0 ± 1.6 vs. 26.3 ± 2.3, P = 0.031) and M12 (27.0 ± 1.7 vs. 26.1 ± 2.4, P = 0.009) were elevated, while cognitive impairment rate at M12 (29.2% vs. 45.7%, P = 0.042) and cognitive impairment severity at M12 (P = 0.029) were declined in RTUC group compared to UC group. Meanwhile, the HADS-anxiety scores at M9 (5.7 ± 3.1 vs. 6.9 ± 4.0, P = 0.046) and M12 (5.6 ± 2.7 vs. 7.0 ± 4.3, P = 0.024), anxiety rate at M12 (22.2% vs. 38.2%, P = 0.039) and anxiety severity at M12 (P = 0.018) were declined in RTUC group compared to UC group. Besides, the HADS-depression score at M12 (5.7 ± 3.1 vs. 6.8 ± 3.3, P = 0.043) was decreased in RTUC group compared to UC group, but depression rate and severity were not different between the two groups at each visit point (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: RTUC program elevates cognitive functions and alleviates mental problems in recurrent AIS patients.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Reminiscence therapy is reported to attenuate the psychological disorders in cancer patients, such as colorectal and lung cancer patients. However, relevant report on surgical prostate cancer patients is scarce. This study put forward a reminiscence therapy-based care program (RTCP + UC) combing reminiscence therapy with usual care (UC), and aimed to evaluate the impact of RTCP + UC on anxiety, depression, quality of life and survival in surgical prostate cancer patients. METHODS: Totally, 108 prostate cancer patients receiving surgical resection were enrolled, who were subsequently randomized and allocated to the RTCP + UC group (N = 55) and UC group (N = 53) at a 1:1 ratio. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and QLQ-C30 were assessed at month M0, M3, M6, M9 and M12 during the intervention period. After intervention, patients were followed up for another 24 months to calculate disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: RTCP + UC decreased HADS-anxiety score at M9 and M12, declined HADS-depression score at M6, M9 and M12, reduced depression rate and the severity level of depression at M12, while did not affect these issues at other time points. Meanwhile, RTCP + UC enhanced the QLQ-C30 global health status score at M3, M6, M9 and M12, but did not influence the QLQ-C30 function score and QLQ-C30 symptom score at any time points. Meanwhile, RTCP + UC had no effect on the accumulating DFS and OS of surgical prostate cancer patients. CONCLUSION: RTCP + UC serves as an optional nursing modality in alleviating anxiety and depression, improving quality of life in surgical prostate cancer patients.",

However, it is difficult for caregivers in care homes to make this part of their daily practice because remembering a resident's individual stories is difficult. Proximity-aware technologies can make rapid connections between residents, their histories, and nearby artefacts. Through a user-centred iterative design approach, we designed Memento, a prototype technology system that makes it easy and convenient for caregivers to connect residents with real stories from their past and engage them in meaningful conversations. Memento displays connections between a resident's stories and their surroundings on a caregiver smartphone. Caregivers can then subtly use this information to start spontaneous reminiscences with residents, as they go about their everyday activities. Remembering their histories was highly enjoyable for residents, giving them a renewed sense of self-confidence and well-being.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment can represent a predecessor to neuro-degenerative processes; however, evidence suggests that non-pharmacologic interventions such as reminiscence therapy (RT) and cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) can potentially stabilize or reverse this trend. Community-based settings are widely regarded as the key area of intervention by healthcare professionals in this field. Thus, this study aimed to assess the effects of an RT and a CST program in the cognition, depressive symptomatology, and quality of life (QoL) of older adults with cognitive decline who attend community support structures (CSS) in central Portugal. A quasi-experimental study with two arms (RT and CST program) was conducted for seven weeks. Participants were allocated to each arm based on the CSS they attended. Of the 109 older adults initially screened, 76 completed the intervention (50 in the RT program and 26 in the CST program). A pre- and post-intervention analysis showed statistically significant differences in older adults' cognition, especially in their delayed recall ability, in both groups. Older adults in the RT program evidence improved QoL scores post-intervention. Both the RT and CST programs implemented throughout the study are beneficial to older adults' cognitive performance, although results are more pronounced in the earlier stages of cognitive decline. Participation in the RT program was associated with improvements in older adults' QoL scores."

This study aimed to develop an AI-based computer application that recreates RT in a personalized way, meeting the characteristics of RT guided by a therapist or a caregiver. The material guiding RT focuses on intangible cultural heritage. The application incorporates facial expression analysis and reinforcement learning techniques, with the aim of identifying the user's emotions and, with them, guiding the computer system that emulates RT dynamically and in real time. A pilot study was carried out at five senior centers in Barcelona and Portugal. The results obtained are very positive, showing high user satisfaction.

Reminiscence therapy is a commonly implemented alternative option used in long-term care facilities. Reminiscence therapy is designed for cognitive decline that is also known as life review. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Reminiscence therapy, known as psychosocial interventions in dementia care, can be used to assist people with dementia recollect prior events, activities, and experiences in order to improve their cognitive, mood, and overall well-being. Reminiscence therapy increased cognitive function and quality of life and reduced depressive and neuropsychiatric symptoms among people with dementia. Reminiscence therapy may be considered a useful non-pharmacological intervention for people with dementia living in nursing homes or other long-term care facilities. The development of a global standard protocol for the application of reminiscence therapy may be necessary for future randomized controlled trials (RCTs). ABSTRACT: Introduction Reminiscence therapy is an alternative to pharmaceutical intervention provided during long-term care, especially for individuals with dementia. However, the effects of reminiscence therapy in dementia care remain inconclusive. Aim The goal of this study is to examine the effects of reminiscence therapy implementation in people with dementia. Design Systematic literature review and meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Methods This study searched systematically using 6 databases. The eligibility criteria included patients with dementia, applied reminiscence therapy, randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental studies, and published in the English language. The PEDro scale was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. The meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model to calculate the pooled effects of reminiscence therapy. Stata 16.0 was used for statistical analysis. Result A total of 29 studies met the eligibility criteria, including 3102 participants. Overall, reminiscence therapy increased cognitive functions and quality of life and decreased depression and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Implication for Practice Reminiscence therapy may be considered a useful non-pharmacological intervention for people with dementia living in nursing homes or other long-term care facilities. A standard protocol for reminiscence therapy may be necessary for future studies.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Non-pharmacological intervention options, including individual reminiscence therapy (iRT), have been effective in improving cognitive functioning, mood, and quality of life (QoL) in persons with neurocognitive disorders (NCD). OBJECTIVES: A 13-week randomized trial intervention utilizing iRT was conducted on older adults with NCD. We explored predictors of participants with positive and non-positive intervention responses using responder analysis, an analytic strategy that focuses on contributors to intervention response. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Re-analysis of a published single-blind, multicentre, randomised controlled trial on 251 older adult residents with NCD from residential facilities across Portugal. Participants received 13 weeks of biweekly iRT (26 sessions) or treatment/programming as usual. Outcomes included global cognition (Minimental State Examination), memory (MAT), executive functioning (FAB), depressive symptoms (GDS-15), and QoL (QoL-AD). RESULTS: There were more responders in the intervention than the control group on all five criteria, with significant differences for cognition (p = 0.001; f = 0.202; NNT = 5) and memory (p = 0.004; f = 0.184; NNT = 6). At baseline, intervention responders vs non-responders had: higher QoL-AD scores (30.23 vs 25.57; p < 0.001; d = -0.774) for cognition; lower FAB scores (1.41 vs -2.12; p < 0.001; d = 0.928) for executive functioning; higher GDS-15 scores for the depressive symptoms (7.57 vs 4.91; p < 0.001; d = -0.845), and for QoL (6.81 vs 5.33; p = 0.013; d = -0.443). CONCLUSIONS: The iRT intervention showed high response rates for cognition and memory. Those with worse executive dysfunction, mood, and QoL, benefitted most from the intervention for those respective outcomes. Therefore, the presented iRT has beneficial effects for people with NCD, with mood and QoL as important influential factors.",

      "abstract": "Objective: Numerous communication support systems based on reminiscence therapy have been developed. However, when using communication support systems, the emotional assessment of older people is generally conducted using verbal feedback or questionnaires. The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using Electroencephalography (EEG) signals for automatic emotion recognition during RT for older people. Participants: Eleven older people (mean 71.25, SD 4.66) and seven young people (mean 22.4, SD 1.51) participated in the experiment. Methods: Old public photographs were used as material for reminiscence therapy. The EEG signals of the older people were collected while the older people and young people were talking about the contents of the photos. Since emotions change slowly and responses are characterized by delayed effects in EEG, the depth models LSTM and Bi-LSTM were selected to extract complex emotional features from EEG signals for automatic recognition of emotions. Results: The EEG data of 8 channels were inputted into the LSTM and Bi-LSTM models to classify positive and negative emotions. The recognition highest accuracy rate of the two models were 90.8% and 95.8% respectively. The four-channel EEG data based Bi-LSTM also reached 94.4%. Conclusion: Since the Bi-LSTM model could tap into the influence of \"past\" and \"future\" emotional states on the current emotional state in the EEG signal, we found that it can help improve the ability to recognize positive and negative emotions in older people. In particular, it is feasible to use EEG signals without the necessity of multimodal physiological signals for emotion recognition in the communication support systems for reminiscence therapy when using this model."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Using technology to deliver psychosocial interventions such as reminiscence therapy (RT) to people with dementia may improve their mental health. Yet, establishing the feasibility of digital interventions in low- to middle-income countries is still in the early stages. This study aimed to: (i) determine the feasibility of using digital touch screen technology to deliver RT among people with dementia living in Jordanian care homes; and (ii) compare study outcomes pre- and post-reminiscence sessions to investigate whether specific outcomes are sensitive to change and explore the acceptability and experiences of the intervention. METHODS: A pragmatic mixed-method study design was implemented. Sixty residents with dementia were recruited from two Jordanian care homes (Site 1: n = 35; Site 2: n = 10). A process evaluation was conducted alongside a single-group pre-post-intervention study. The intervention involved 10 supported RT sessions of up to 1 h each, delivered over 5 weeks. Feasibility was determined by assessing the rate of recruitment, adherence, retention, data completion, implementation fidelity, and adverse events. Qualitative semi-structured interview questions were used to explore experience and acceptability, and data were thematically analysed. RESULTS: Response rate was 100%; loss to follow up at post-intervention was 25%. Median session attendance for those who received the intervention was 80%. No serious adverse events were reported. A positive, statistically significant and clinically relevant difference was found in all outcome measures before and after reminiscence sessions. Qualitative findings suggest that digital RT intervention is generally well accepted by people with dementia who reported positive changes, including enhanced communication and cognitive abilities. CONCLUSION: Using digital touch screen technology to deliver RT is feasible and acceptable among people with dementia in Jordanian care homes. Digital RT intervention is a promising approach to improving mental health and communication for people living with dementia.",

This research aims to evaluate the ability of individual RT, using a simple reminiscence format, to improve the overall cognitive function, memory, executive functions, emotional status, and quality of life in older adults with neurocognitive disorders who received social care and support services. A multicenter randomized controlled trial was completed in the Azores archipelago (an independent region of Portugal) using repeated measures (pre-intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up). The intervention group underwent individual RT sessions, twice weekly for 13 weeks, while the control group completed regular activities administered as part of their program. Results did not reveal any significant differences between the intervention and control groups. While results did not reveal significant effects, a number of historical and contextual factors are considered as possible explanations for the lack of effects-namely, data collection occurring during the COVID-19 global pandemic, participant cohort effects, and therapist heterogeneity."

A literature search was conducted in CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and Embase from inception to December 2020. Five RCTs with 267 participants were included; two were meta-analysed. Cochrane collaboration's risk of bias tool was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the included RCTs, and the risk of bias across studies was assessed using the GRADE method. The overall quality of evidence was moderate to low. Among the five trials, none measured the efficacy of RT on agitation. Reminiscence therapy was effective in reducing depression and improving autobiographical memory, but its effects were inconsistent. There was a significant improvement in quality of life (QoL) following RT. The meta-analysis showed no statistical significance on the pre-post intervention differences in depression (SMD -0.28, 95%CI -0.91-0.35, p > 0.05) and autobiographical memory scores (SMD 0.57, 95%CI -0.07-1.21, p > 0.05).

This study aimed to assess the impact of reminiscence therapy involved care (RTIC) and usual care (UC) on anxiety, depression, QoL, and survival in postoperative cervical cancer patients. METHODS: In this randomized control study, 152 eligible postoperative cervical cancer patients were randomized as 1:1 ratio into RTIC (N = 76) and UC (N = 76) groups: the former received routine care and RT, while the latter only received routine care for 12 months. Anxiety, depression, and QoL were evaluated from baseline (month (M) 0) to M12, respectively. Patients were continuously followed up to M36 for overall survival (OS) calculation. RESULTS: HADS-Anxiety score from M6 to M12 was decreased; both HADS-Depression score from M9 to M12 and depression rate at M12 were reduced in RTIC group compared with UC group (all P < 0.05). QLQ-C30 global health status score at M6 and M12, as well as QLQ-C30 function score at M12, was increased in RTIC group compared with UC group (all P < 0.05). However, QLQ-C30 symptom score at each visit and OS exhibited no difference between the two groups. From sub-group analysis, RTIC disclosed a distinct effect on patients whose age ≥ 50 years but not on those < 50 years. CONCLUSION: RTIC reduces anxiety (partly) and depression and improves QoL in postoperative cervical cancer patients, especially in old patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Apathy is a frequent and underrecognized neurological disorder symptom. Reduced goal-directed behavior caused by apathy is associated with poor outcomes for older adults in residential aged care. Recommended nonpharmacological treatments include person-centered therapy using information and communication technology. Virtual reality (VR) in the form of head-mounted displays (HMDs) is a fully immersive technology that provides access to a wide range of freely available content. The use of VR as a therapy tool has demonstrated promise in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder and anxiety. In addition, VR has been used to improve conditions including depression, anxiety, cognitive function, and balance in older adults with memory deficits, Alzheimer disease, and Parkinson disease. Research using VR for the symptoms of apathy in older adults living in residential aged care facilities is limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine whether using HMDs as a tool for reminiscence therapy improves the symptoms of apathy compared with using a laptop computer and physical items with older adults living in residential aged care. METHODS: In this multisite trial, 43 participants were allocated to one of three groups: reminiscence therapy intervention using VR in the form of HMDs, reminiscence therapy using a laptop computer supplemented by physical items if required (active control), and a usual care (passive control) group. The primary outcome was apathy, and the secondary outcomes included cognition and depression. The side effects of using HMDs were also measured in the VR group. RESULTS: Mixed model analyses revealed no significant group interaction over time in outcomes between the VR and laptop groups (estimate=-2.24, SE 1.89; t40=-1.18; P=.24). Pooled apathy scores in the two intervention groups compared with the passive control group also revealed no significant group interaction over time (estimate=-0.26, SE 1.66; t40=-0.16; P=.88). There were no significant secondary outcomes. Most participants in the VR group stated that they would prefer to watch content in VR than on a flat screen (Χ22=11.2; P=.004), side effects from HMD use were negligible to minimal according to the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire cutoff scores. CONCLUSIONS: Although there were no significant results in outcome measures, this study found that participants engaged in the research and enjoyed the process of reminiscing using both forms of technology. It was found that VR can be implemented in an aged care setting with correct protocols in place. Providing residents in aged care with a choice of technology may assist in increasing participation in activities. We cannot dismiss the importance of immediate effects while the therapy was in progress, and this is an avenue for future research.

      "abstract": "In Japan, a shift in family patterns has led to a sense of social isolation among older people, which increases the risk of major neurocognitive disorder. Interventions for them using old photos to implement reminiscence therapy (RT) have been proved to be effective. A super-aged society has in turn led to a shortage of medical resources and older people prefer home care over institutional care. Therefore, there is an urgent need for volunteers to help in RT. However, the age of volunteers tends to be increasingly younger. The lack of knowledge and experience of the past for the young volunteers makes it difficult for them to select appropriate stimulated materials. To improve this situation, a library of old photos for RT was developed to support conversation between the two generations. A two-factor experiment and emotion assessment scales were designed to explore the effect of different old photo types on the fluency of conversation between the two generations and their emotion. It was found that the types of old photos have little effect on older people and that conversations were almost pleasant. However, the pleasantness of older people was enhanced when using photos that they wanted to talk about (P = 0.006). Meanwhile, pleasure in conversation of the older people increased with the attention of the young people to the topic (R = 0.304, p < 0.001). Conversely, photo type has a strong impact on young people. When photos are selected that older people do not want to talk about or photos that young people do not know the content and are not interested in, concern for the topic of young people drops dramatically. Therefore, when RT, it is important to avoid using the types of photos above that cause a drop in younger people's attention."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of individual reminiscence therapy given during home visits on adaptation difficulties. METHOD: This was a randomized controlled, single-blind study designed with a pretest-post-test and follow-up pattern. We divided the participants, 65 elderly people living in Isparta, Turkey, by simple randomization into intervention (31) and control (34) groups. Individual reminiscence therapy was applied to the intervention group participants for eight weeks during house visits once a week. The weekly topics of the reminiscence therapy included childhood, business life, married life, old items, holidays, traditional dishes, and songs and movies, and were all culture-specific. No intervention was applied to the control group. Study data were collected by using a Sociodemographic Data Form created by the researchers, the Assessment Scale of Adaptation Difficulty for the Elderly (ASADE), and the Nurses' Observation Scale for Geriatric Patients (NOSGER). Pretest, post-test, and follow-up data were collected at the individuals' homes in face-to-face interviews. RESULTS: After the eight-week course of reminiscence therapy, there was a significant decrease in the ASADE mean score for the intervention group (P = 0.003) and a significant increase for the control group (P < 0.001). Significant increases were also found in the mean NOSGER scores for the intervention (P = 0.039) and control (P < 0.001) groups; however, the score increase was higher for the control than for the intervention group. Also, there was a significant difference in the ASADE (P < 0,001) and NOSGER (P = 0.01) mean scores of the intervention and control groups.

      "abstract": "Objective: Depression is one of the most common problems faced by older adults. Reminiscence therapy, defined as using the recall of past events, feelings, and thoughts facilitating pleasure, is one type of psychotherapy that could alleviate depressive feelings among older adults, improve their quality of life, and help them live independently. Reminiscence therapy originated from geriatric psychiatry, and is an effective non-pharmacological intervention that could be structured or unstructured and be conducted individually or in a group. The current systematic review was designed to summarize and review existing evidence on the effect of reminiscence therapy on depression in older adults. Methods: We conducted a systematic review from January 2000 to Mar 2021 using 10 electronic databases in English and Chinese languages, including Medline, Embase, Cinahl, PsychInfo, Cochrane, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Science Direct, CNKI, and WANFANG. We excluded studies that didn't use randomized controlled trials (RCT) from the meta-analysis. The selected studies were scored using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. The RevMan 5.0 was used in subgroup analysis depending on how the interventions were classified. Results: We extracted 527 studies based on keyword searches, of which 10 RCTs met inclusion criteria were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis yielded high heterogeneity, and the analyses of significant subgroups showed that reminiscence therapy has a significant effect on relieving depressive symptoms in older adults. Reminiscence therapy benefits older adults with chronic illness and those on antidepressants as well. The effect and cost-effectiveness of group reminiscence therapy were higher than individual reminiscence therapy. And some specific types of group reminiscence therapy have a significant effect on improving depression and secondary outcomes, including life satisfaction. Although the effectiveness of structured and unstructured group reminiscence on depression has no significant differences according to current evidence, the structured therapy is more replicable, generalizable, and user-friendly due to its detailed protocol for new therapists. Furthermore, reminiscence therapy is more effective for older women and older adults with more severe depressive symptoms. Conclusion: Reminiscence therapy significantly increased older adults' remission from depression and quality of life immediately after the intervention. However, the evidence-based protocol and implementation of reminiscence interventions need to be further developed and standardized to facilitate global use. Moreover, it remains unclear on the long-term effect of reminiscence therapy. Based on the limitations of the current study, more rigorous evidence is needed from studies with large sample sizes, RCT design, and longer follow-up periods. Future studies could also explore the effect of different types of reminiscence therapy. Furthermore, qualitative data should be included to better understand older adults' narrative and experiences with reminiscence therapy. Future studies could also investigate the impact of reminiscence therapy on older relatives as a part of outcome measure to explore the efficacious mechanism of reminiscence therapy in alleviating older adults' depressive symptoms."

A comprehensive RT program (Core program followed by a Follow-up program) was provided to clinically stable volunteers aged 65 years or more, who did not have severe cognitive impairment. RESULTS: From the 50 older adults (32 women and 18 men, with mean age of 83.32±7.76, and mean education level of 5.48±4.05) considered eligible to participate in the study, 35 (mean age: 84.17±7.46, mean education level of 6.14±4.49) completed the Core Program and 28 completed the Follow-up Program (mean age: 84.25±7.66, mean education level of 6.18±4.57). Based on the Wilcoxon Test, it was observed that the participants' cognitive performance did not change during the two RT programs. No significant changes were confirmed in relation to depressive symptomatology and QOL. CONCLUSION: Although no statistically significant improvements of the older adults' cognitive function, depressive symptomatology, and quality of life were found, the stabilization of such outcomes are relevant from a clinical viewpoint. Further studies are necessary to confirm these findings."

It is highly recommended that people with Alzheimer regularly receive this type of therapy. In this paper, we describe the development of a conversational system that can be used as a tool to provide reminiscence therapy to people with Alzheimer's disease. The system has the ability to personalize the therapy according to the patients information related to their preferences, life history and lifestyle. An evaluation conducted with eleven people related to patient care (caregiver = 9, geriatric doctor = 1, care center assistant = 1) shows that the system is capable of carrying out a reminiscence therapy according to the patient information in a successful manner."

The functions of music in reminiscence therapy remains unclear. Drawing on interdisciplinary research in music therapy, psychology, sociology, gerontology, and neuroscience, this paper proposes a theoretical model for understanding the multiple functions of music when used in reminiscence therapy, and describes how music-assisted reminiscence therapy might be used to improve the wellbeing of older people. The SEED model proposes that music, when used together with reminiscence interventions, helps to: 1) summon autobiographical memories; 2) evoke strong emotional reactions; 3) elicit physiological responses; and 4) define identity. Evidence for the four proposed functions of music in reminiscence interventions is presented. The SEED model expands on previous research and theory on music and reminiscence, neural and cognitive processing, and the therapeutic use of music. The SEED model maps the benefits and indicators for the use of music in reminiscence therapy and provides a blueprint for research to test the purported benefits of using music to enhance reminiscence therapy.",

The results can provide a scientific foundation for improving psychological health. METHOD: A randomized controlled trial of 64 (aged 65.70 ± 3.69 years) Chinese rural older adults living alone was conducted. They were randomly divided into either an eight-month intervention group or a control group. The perceived stress scale (PSS) and the UCLA loneliness scale (UCLA-LS) evaluated the perceived stress and loneliness of the two groups at three different times. A repeated-measures analysis of variance model was used to compare each outcome measure of the two groups. RESULTS: The CTFA-GRT yielded a benefit for the perceived stress and loneliness of rural older adults living alone in the intervention group. Combined with a simple effects test, the PSS and UCLA-LS of those in the intervention groups significantly decreased at eight months after the baseline (F PSS = 23.540, F UCLA-LS = 40.159; all P < 0.01). In addition, the sustainable effect of this program lasted three months after the intervention (F PSS = 65.756, F UCLA-LS = 60.983; all P < 0.01).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Reminiscence therapy is revealed to improve cognitive function and attenuate psychological disorders in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease patients, while its application in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is seldom reported. So, the current study aimed to explore the effect of reminiscence therapy on cognitive impairment, anxiety, depression, and disease recurrence in AIS patients. METHODS: A total of 216 first-ever AIS patients were enrolled and randomized into reminiscence therapy group or control group in 1:1 ratio. MMSE, HADS, and Zung SAS/SDS scales were evaluated at the discharge from hospital (M0), 3 months (M3), 6 months (M6), 9 months (M9), and 12 months (M12), respectively. Besides, patients were further followed up to 36 months for recurrence-free survival (RFS) calculation. RESULTS: Reminiscence therapy group showed higher MMSE score at M9 and M12, lower cognitive impairment rate by MMSE at M12 compared to control group. As to anxiety, HADS-anxiety score and anxiety rate by HADS were of no difference at each time point, while SAS score and anxiety rate by SAS were lower at M12 in reminiscence therapy group compared with control group. Regarding depression, HADS-depression score and depression rate by HADS at M12, SDS score at M9 and M12, and depression rate by SDS at M12 were all lower in reminiscence therapy group compared with control group. In terms of RFS, it was similar between reminiscence therapy group and control group. CONCLUSION: Reminiscence therapy cripples cognitive impairment, anxiety, and depression, but does not affect RFS in AIS patients, indicating its potential for post-stroke management.",

METHODS: There were 210 post-resection CRC patients recruited and randomly received RTC (N = 105) or control care (CC) (N = 105) for 12 months. Their anxiety, depression and quality of life were assessed using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) at baseline (Month (M) 0), M3, M6 and M12. Patients were further followed up to 36 months, followed by the overall survival (OS) calculation. RESULTS: HADS-anxiety score was decreased at M6/M12 and anxiety patients' percentage was reduced at M12 in RTC group compared with CC group; HADS-depression score was lower at M6/M12, while depression patients' percentage was similar at each time point in RTC group compared with CC group; QLQ-C30 global health status score and QLQ-C30 functions score were increased at M6/M12, while QLQ-C30 symptoms score was similar at each time point in RTC group compared with CC group. Further sub-group analysis displayed that: in patients with age ≥65 years, patients with pathological grade G2 and patients with TNM stage Ⅱ-Ⅲ, RTC showed more remarkable effect. Additionally, OS showed a higher trend in RTC group compared with CC group, but without statistical difference. CONCLUSION: RTC contributes to anxiety and depression alleviations as well as the quality of life improvement in CRC patients.",

METHODS: In this randomized, controlled study, a total of 192 newly diagnosed post-operational NSCLC patients were randomly assigned to control care program (CCP) group (N = 96) or RTCP group (N = 96), and both groups experienced 12-month intervention and 36-month follow-up without intervention. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) were evaluated at baseline (M0), month (M)3, M6, and M12. RESULTS: Reduced HADS-anxiety score at M6 and M12, anxiety rate at M12, and anxiety severity at M6 and M12 were observed in RTCP group compared with CCP group. Additionally, HADS-depression score was decreased at M6 and M12, while both depression rate and severity were of no difference at each time point between two groups. Furthermore, QLQ-C30 global health status score at M6 and M12, QLQ-C30 functions score at M12 were increased, while QLQ-C30 symptoms score was of no difference at each time point in RTCP group compared with CCP group. Regarding survival profiles, Kaplan-Meier curves indicated that disease-free survival and overall survival were of no difference between two groups, further multivariate Cox's proportional hazard regression analysis also observed the same trends. CONCLUSION: RTCP effectively relieves anxiety and depression, improves QoL, but did not prolong survival, suggesting its value as a non-pharmacological approach for post-operational NSCLC management.",

METHODS: A single-blind, multicentre, randomised parallel two-arm controlled trial recruited 251 people with neurocognitive disorders attending 24 institutions providing care and support services for older adults in Portugal. The primary outcome measure was cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]). Secondary outcomes were memory (Memory Alteration Test [MAT]), executive function (Frontal Assessment Battery [FAB]), mood (Geriatric Depression Scale-15 [GDS-15]) and self-reported QoL-Alzheimer's disease AD). Participants in the intervention group (n = 131) received 26 individual RT sessions, twice a week, over the course of 13 weeks. Participants in the control group (n = 120) maintained their treatment as usual. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis showed that, at endpoint assessment, the intervention group had significantly improved in relation to the control group in MMSE (mean difference 1.84, 95% CI [0.80, 2.89], p = .001, d = .44), MAT (mean difference 2.82, 95% CI [0.72, 4.91], p = .009, d = .34) and QoL-AD (mean difference 1.78, 95% CI [0.17, 3.39], p = .031, d = .28).

This review set out to provide a better understanding of reminiscence therapy through a deeper analysis of its contents and delivery. METHOD: This review examined 22 studies from the most recent Cochrane review (Woods, B., O'Philbin, L., Farrell, E. M., Spector, A. E., & Orrell, M. (2018). Reminiscence therapy for dementia. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 3, Article 001120) and addressed the following research questions: (1) What are the components of reminiscence therapy? (2) Who delivers reminiscence therapy? (3) How is reminiscence therapy delivered? (4) Is reminiscence therapy underpinned by a theoretical framework? (5) Is reminiscence therapy delivered according to a programme/model? (6) Are there commonalities in the reminiscence therapy components utilised? Multiple and layered narrative analyses were completed. FINDINGS: Thirteen reminiscence therapy components were identified. 'Memory triggers' and 'themes' were identified as the most common but were found not to be consistently beneficial. Reminiscence therapy was typically delivered in a care setting using a group approach; however, there was no consistency in session composition, intervention duration, as well as the training and supervision provided to facilitators. Operationalisation of theory within reminiscence therapy was not identified. Reminiscence therapy was not consistently delivered according to a programme/model. Lastly, as a result of a small number of studies, the components 'life stages', 'activities' and 'family-only sessions', showed beneficial promise. In summary, this review highlights that reminiscence therapy needs more consistency in content and delivery, in addition to a clear theoretical framework.",

In this study, we aimed to assess the benefit of a reminiscence therapy-based care (RTBC) program on cognitive impairment restoration, anxiety, and depression reduction in AIS patients. METHODS: Totally 130 AIS patients were recruited in this randomized, controlled study and randomly assigned to the RTBC group or control group in 1:1 ratio for 12-month intervention. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale for anxiety/depression (HADS-A/HADS-D), and Zung self-rating anxiety/depression scale (SAS/SDS) were assessed at month 0 (M0), M3, M6, M9, and M12. Meanwhile, patients' satisfaction was also evaluated at M3, M6, M9, and M12. RESULTS: RTBC increased MMSE score and MoCA score and reduced cognitive impairment patients' percentage assessed by MoCA score at M12 compared with control. RTBC reduced HADS-A score at M12, but not anxiety patients' percentage or severity by HADS-A at M12; besides, RTBC significantly lowered the SAS score at M9 and M12, and anxiety patients' percentage and severity by SAS at M12 compared with control. RTBC reduced HADS-D score at M9 and M12 (while statistically non-significant), but not depression patients' percentage or severity by HADS-D at M12; it decreased SDS score at M9 and M12, but not depression patients' percentage or severity by SDS at M12 compared with control. Additionally, RTBC obsessed higher patients' satisfaction at M3, M6, and M12 compared with control.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Reminiscence therapy (RT) can improve various dysfunctions in people with dementia (PWD), but it may not be a cost-effective intervention. Digital RT allows multiple users to participate in a therapy simultaneously. Moreover, digital RT offers convenience, such as for uploading personal materials and presenting individual triggers of personal memories. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the effect of digital RT through a comparison with conventional RT and to develop a strategy for designing larger RCTs. METHODS: An Android application and digital content were developed for digital RT. Overall, 49 PWD enrolled in nine daycare centers in Korea met the inclusion criteria. Eight sessions of digital RT in an intervention group (n = 25) and storytelling in a control group (n = 24) with no digital materials were performed over 4 weeks from February to June 2019. Cognition, depression, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), and engagement were measured as the primary outcomes to evaluate the effect of digital RT. All outcomes except for engagement were evaluated at baseline before the intervention (T0), post-intervention (T1), and 4 weeks after the intervention (T2). Engagement was measured at the first and last intervention sessions. Differences in cognition, depression and BPSD between groups and across time points (T0, T1, and T2) were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA. Differences in engagement between the groups and time points (the first and last sessions) were analyzed by independent t-tests. This study adhered to the CONSORT guidelines. RESULTS: Depression (F = 7.62, p = .001, partial η2 = .17) was significantly decreased at T1 and T2, and engagement (t = - 2.71, p = .011) was significantly increased at the last session in the digital RT group compared to the control group. However, cognition (F = 0.13, p = .821) and BPSD (F = 0.67, p = .485) were not significantly different between groups and time points. CONCLUSIONS: Digital RT proved an innovative approach to manage PWD and will thus help PWD achieve a better mood and have more opportunities to engage in social interactions.

Despite the close relationship between cognition and language, the impact on communication has received limited attention. This study aimed to investigate whether the spoken discourse of older adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia could be improved within the genre of nostalgic recounts following group reminiscence therapy, and whether change generalised to everyday discourse.Method: Four females (mean: 87 years, SD: 7.3) who lived in a residential aged care facility and were diagnosed with mild (n = 2) or major (n = 2) neurocognitive impairment were recruited to attend a group reminiscence programme delivered in eight one-hour treatment sessions over four weeks. Multiple baseline samples of discourse were obtained in the week prior to intervention to monitor stability. Macrostructure, rate, informativeness and efficiency of discourse production were measured to identify change within nostalgic recounts and monitor evidence of generalised change in everyday discourse genres. Cognitive performance and quality of life were also monitored.Result: While variability was evident, significant increases in macrostructure and richness of nostalgic recounts were found for two participants, with significant generalisation to everyday discourse. Both participants had diagnoses of mild cognitive impairment. No significant improvements were seen in cognition or quality of life with all participants.Conclusion: This study provides promising evidence for the spoken recall of memories having the potential to improve the communication of people with neurocognitive disorders, with some indication that people with milder impairment may be more amenable to this form of intervention. Nostalgic recounts may provide an explicit context in which speech-language pathologists can facilitate the planning of spoken production in people with cognitive impairment, and influence speaking in everyday contexts.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although evidence shows that reminiscence therapy relieves depression in the elderly, few studies have explored its mechanisms and it is unclear whether old public photos rather than personal photos are effective prompts. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study with an event-related design were to explore whether old public photos can evoke autobiographical memories and compare brain-activation responses to photos between elderly women with depressive symptoms (DS) and normal controls (NC). METHODS: Elderly women with DS (n = 16) and NC (n = 18) were recruited from urban communities in Southwest China. Participants responded with a key press to indicate which of 40 photos evoked autobiographical memories at first sight during 3.0 T scanning. Afterward, they rated photos on a 9-point Likert-type scale on the degrees of recall (DOR), arousal, and pleasure elicited and the degree to which photos felt old. RESULTS: Mean DOR scores were 8.47 ± 0.77 and 1.37 ± 1.09 for high- and low-DOR photos, respectively. Response time was longer in DS compared to NC participants. Brain areas activated by exposure to high-DOR photos differed between groups, with reminiscence leading to decreased activation of the bilateral superior temporal gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus, right parahippocampal gyrus, left cingulate gyrus, right insular lobe, and bilateral cerebellum anterior lobe in DS compared to NC participants. CONCLUSION: Old public photos can evoke autobiographical memory. DS are associated with brain dysfunction. Early intervention for DS is recommended in the elderly.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cognitive degeneration and agitated behavior symptoms of dementia in older adults are the main causes of disability and inability and increase the cost of medical care. Agitated behavior symptoms of dementia are the main causes of early institutionalization and make caregivers exhausted. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of art therapy and reminiscence therapy on the alleviation of agitated behaviors in older adults with dementia. METHODS: An experimental research design with two experimental groups and one comparison group was conducted to examine the effects for each group on agitated behaviors. Participants were recruited from two dementia care centers in central and northern Taiwan. The study included 54 older individuals who met the sampling criteria and completed the data collection process. The participants were randomly allocated into the art therapy group (n = 24), the reminiscence therapy group (n = 22), and the comparison group (n = 8). The intervention consisted of 50-minute sessions conducted weekly for 12 weeks. Regular activities were continued in the comparison group. The structured questionnaires were completed, and observations of agitated behaviors were collected before the intervention and at 1 and 6 weeks after the intervention. RESULTS: Significant differences were found in agitated behavior symptoms at the three time points in the art therapy group, whereas reminiscence therapy was found to have had a clear and immediate effect on decreasing agitated behavior. The generalized estimating equation exchange model test revealed a significant and sustained, postintervention effect of art therapy on agitated behavior. In contrast, no significant and sustained effect on agitated behavior was observed in the reminiscence therapy group. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study support that art therapy may have a positive effect on dementia-associated agitated behaviors in institutionalized older adults. Reminiscence therapy activities conducted weekly for 50 minutes each session did not reach statistically significant implications. It is suggested that future studies consider conducting art and reminiscence therapies for a 16-week duration with two weekly sessions to evaluate the effectiveness of the therapy. The duration of follow-up should be extended as well in future studies.",

The current review seeks to develop a unifying way to administer reminiscence therapy that will be effective for older adults with Alzheimer's disease. The review used the PRISMA guidelines in the literature search and data extraction. Results showed the effectiveness of reminiscence therapy in older adults with Alzheimer's disease, area of cognition, depression, activities of daily living, and quality of life. Additionally, for the therapy to be effective, it must be conducted regularly in a small group of patients for an average of 45 min for 8- to 12-week duration. Patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease are most likely to benefit with the use of photographs, videos, and music that are associated with their past experiences.

Aging is often accompanied by solitude and illness, which causes senior veterans to doubt the meaning of life and to lose confidence in the value of life. This study tested the effectiveness of a group reminiscence therapy protocol on the depression and meaning of life among elderly institutionalized veterans. A quasi-experimental design was applied. A convenience sample of older adults was drawn from two veteran homes in southern Taiwan. Participants were assigned to intervention or control groups based on the veterans' homes they attended. The participants in the intervention group carried out group reminiscence therapy for 8 weeks in addition to their daily activities. The participants in the comparison group maintained their daily activities. Both groups were evaluated using the GDS-SF and MLS scale including two aspects of depression mood and meaning of life in weeks 1 and 8. The overall life satisfaction increased significantly over time for the intervention group compared to the comparison group from week 1 to week 8. The group reminiscence therapy programs showed promising effects in improving the depression and meaning of life of older veterans living in veteran homes.",

The objective of this review article was to assess the effects of reminiscence therapy (RT) on people living with dementia.

The authors concluded that there is some evidence that RT can improve quality of life, cognition, communication and possibly mood in people with dementia in some circumstances, although all the benefits were small. Further research is needed to understand these differences and to find out who is likely to benefit most from what type of RT.",

A single-blind randomized parallel-design controlled trial was conducted between May 1, 2017, and April 30, 2018. Ninety patients with mild-to-moderate AD recruited from Beijing Geriatric Hospital were randomly allocated into intervention (n = 45) and control groups (n = 45). In the intervention group, group-based reminiscence therapy was performed in two 30- to 45-minute sessions weekly for 12 weeks. Control participants received only conventional drug treatments and routine daily care. Alzheimer disease-related symptoms were evaluated using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive section, the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and the Barthel Index. Four time points were set for data collection: baseline (before treatment), 4 weeks (during treatment), 12 weeks (end of treatment), and 24 weeks (12 weeks posttreatment). χ2 Tests, independent t tests, repeated-measures analysis of variance, and Bonferroni tests were used for data analysis. Significant improvements in depressive and neuropsychiatric symptoms were found in the intervention group compared to the control group (P < .05). Mean CSDD scores in the intervention group were improved at all 3 time points compared to baseline and showed the greatest effect at 12 weeks (t = 2.076, P = .041) and 24 weeks follow-up (t = 3.834, P = .000) compared to controls. Group reminiscence therapy was effective for improving depressive symptoms and was beneficial for treating neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with AD.",

METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published from January 2000 to January 2018 were searched through Research Information Sharing Service (RISS), Korean Studies Information Service System (KISS), Korean Medical Database (KMbase), KoreaMed, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Ovid MEDLINE. Two researchers independently performed the search, selection, and coding. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 3.0 was used for meta-analysis, and Review Manager program 5.3 was used for quality assessment. RESULTS: Out of the 1,250 retrieved articles, 22 RCTs were selected for analysis. The overall effect size of reminiscence therapy for mitigating depressive symptoms in older adults with dementia was -0.62 (95% Cl: -0.92 to -0.31). The effect size was greater in older adults under 80, those with less disease severity, and those for whom the therapy session lasted less than 40 minutes. CONCLUSION: Reminiscence therapy is an effective non-pharmacological therapy to improve depressive symptoms in older adults with dementia. Because its effectiveness is also influenced by age, disease severity, and application method, it is necessary to consider treatment designs based on individual characteristics as well as methodological approaches.",

Participation in group reminiscence therapy significantly improved QOL (p < 0.001) across time periods for individuals with dementia. The findings provide information for professional and nonprofessional caregivers of individuals with specific agitated behaviors to improve their QOL.

METHODS: A systematic search of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted using bibliographic databases. A total of 157 original published studies were identified in the search, and 24 complete articles were included in the final review to check for the level of evidence. Two of the study authors independently assessed the quality of the included studies using the \"Risk of Bias\" (ROB) tool developed by the Cochrane Collaboration. Depression, quality of life, and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) were selected to measure the effect of reminiscence therapy. To determine the effects of reminiscence therapy on these variables, each individual study was analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software® (Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA). RESULTS: The overall effect size was presented using standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals. Cohen's d effect size for depression was -0.541 (95% CI: -0.847 to -0.234, Z = -3.730, p<0.001), indicating that depression was significantly reduced in the reminiscence group compared to the control group. Increased quality of life and decreased BPSD were also found in the reminiscence group compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: Reminiscence therapy has a moderate effect on depression and can be broadly used to decrease depression as an alternative to antipsychotics, which can have harmful side effects and high cost.",
