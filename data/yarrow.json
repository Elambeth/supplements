      "abstract": "Drought stress poses a serious threat to agricultural productivity worldwide. This study investigated the mitigative effects of exogenous spermidine on drought stressed yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.). Plants were subjected to three drought levels (25 %, 50 % and 75 % field capacity) and foliar sprayed with 0, 1.5 and 3 μM spermidine. Drought significantly reduced relative water content, photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll, carotenoids), osmolyte (proline, soluble sugars) accumulation and antioxidant enzyme activities such as catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), indicating oxidative damage. Spermidine treatment attenuated drought injury by improving the above parameters. Maximum responses were observed at 1.5 μM for photosynthetic pigments and osmolytes, while 3 μM performed best for secondary metabolites (phenolics, flavonoids, anthocyanins) and antioxidant enzymes. Drought also upregulated secondary metabolites like phenolics, while spermidine further augmented their levels. Moreover, spermidine maintained membrane integrity and osmotic adjustment under water deficit. Overall, spermidine enhanced yarrow's drought tolerance by modulating physiological and biochemical processes. Our findings provide insights into spermidine-induced adaptation mechanisms in plants combating water scarcity. Optimization of spermidine concentration may help develop drought-resilient crops."

      "abstract": "This study investigated the mitigating effects of spermidine on salinity-stressed yarrow plants (Achillea millefolium L.), an economically important medicinal crop. Plants were treated with four salinity levels (0, 30, 60, 90 mM NaCl) and three spermidine concentrations (0, 1.5, 3 μM). Salinity induced electrolyte leakage in a dose-dependent manner, increasing from 22% at 30 mM to 56% at 90 mM NaCl without spermidine. However, 1.5 μM spermidine significantly reduced leakage across salinities by 1.35-11.2% relative to untreated stressed plants. Photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a, b, carotenoids) also exhibited salinity- and spermidine-modulated responses. While salinity decreased chlorophyll a, both spermidine concentrations increased chlorophyll b and carotenoids under most saline conditions. Salinity and spermidine synergistically elevated osmoprotectants proline and total carbohydrates, with 3 μM spermidine augmenting proline and carbohydrates up to 14.4% and 13.1% at 90 mM NaCl, respectively. Antioxidant enzymes CAT, POD and APX displayed complex regulation influenced by treatment factors. Moreover, salinity stress and spermidine also influenced the expression of linalool and pinene synthetase genes, with the highest expression levels observed under 90 mM salt stress and the application of 3 μM spermidine. The findings provide valuable insights into the responses of yarrow plants to salinity stress and highlight the potential of spermidine in mitigating the adverse effects of salinity stress.",

(yarrow) have been reported to exert antitumour activities. Food biotechnology may provide on-demand mixtures of bioactive compounds with complementary activities in cancer treatment. Methods: Supercritical-antisolvent-precipitation (SAS) has been applied to fractionate the bioactive compounds from an Ultrasound-Assisted-Extraction yarrow extract resulting in two extracts with distinct polarity, yarrow-precipitate-(PP) and yarrow-separator-(Sep). Total phenolic content and relevant essential oils have been characterized. Antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative activities have been compared. Moreover, the effect on the inhibition of colorectal cancer cells' bioenergetics has been evaluated. Results: Yarrow-PP exerted the highest antioxidant activity, even higher than the complete UAE-yarrow extract, meanwhile yarrow-Sep showed the highest anti-inflammatory activity, even higher than the complete UAE-yarrow extract. Interestingly, yarrow-Sep inhibited key lipid metabolic targets in CRC cells extensively shown to be implicated in cancer dissemination and prognosis -SREBF1, FASN, ABCA1 and HMGCR- and epithelial to mesenchymal targets-CDH1, ATP1B1, CDH2 and Vimentin-augmenting cell adhesion. Conclusions: In summary, SAS technology has been applied to provide a novel combination of bioactive compounds, yarrow-Sep, which merits further research to be proposed as a potential complementary nutraceutical in the treatment of CRC."

      "abstract": "Achillea millefolium L. is one of the most known medicinal plants with a broad spectrum of applications in the treatment of inflammation, pain, microbial infections and gastrointestinal disorders. In recent years, the extracts from A. millefolium have also been applied in cosmetics with cleansing, moisturizing, shooting, conditioning and skin-lightening properties. The growing demand for naturally derived active substances, worsening environmental pollution and excessive use of natural resources are causing increased interest in the development of alternative methods for the production of plant-based ingredients. In vitro plant cultures are an eco-friendly tool for continuous production of desired plant metabolites, with increasing applicability in cosmetics and dietary supplements. The purpose of the study was to compare phytochemical composition and antioxidant and tyrosinase inhibitory properties of aqueous and hydroethanolic extracts from A. millefolium obtained from field conditions (AmL and AmH extracts) and in vitro cultures (AmIV extracts). In vitro microshoot cultures of A. millefolium were obtained directly from seeds and harvested following 3 weeks of culture. Extracts prepared in water, 50% ethanol and 96% ethanol were compared for the total polyphenolic content, phytochemical content using the ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-hr-qTOF/MS), antioxidant activity by DPPH scavenging assay and the influence on the activity of mushroom and murine tyrosinases. The phytochemical content of AmIV extracts was significantly different from AmL and AmH extracts. Most of the polyphenolic compounds identified in AmL and AmH extracts were present in AmIV extracts only in trace amounts and the major constituents presented in AmIV extracts were fatty acids. The total content of polyphenols in AmIV exceeded 0.25 mg GAE/g of dried extract, whereas AmL and AmH extracts contained from 0.46 ± 0.01 to 2.63 ± 0.11 mg GAE/g of dried extract, depending on the solvent used. The low content of polyphenols was most likely responsible for the low antioxidant activity of AmIV extracts (IC50 values in DPPH scavenging assay >400 µg/mL) and the lack of tyrosinase inhibitory properties. AmIV extracts increased the activity of mushroom tyrosinase and tyrosinase present in B16F10 murine melanoma cells, whereas AmL and AmH extracts showed significant inhibitory potential. The presented data indicated that microshoot cultures of A. millefolium require further experimental research before they can be implemented as a valuable raw material for the cosmetics industry.",

(AM) extract on the Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) model, which is one of the experimental cancer models. Also known as yarrow and plant, AM has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antitumor properties. In our study, 57 male BALB/c type mice, 8-10 weeks old, weighing 25-30 g, were used. Mice were divided into two groups. Ehrlich Solid Tumor group: Negative Control Group (ENC), Positive Control Group (EPC), and Treatment Group (TG) (TNCAM-200 mg/kg, TPCAM-400 mg/kg). EPC and TG were given to EAT cells. Each EAT contained 1 × 106 (will be 6 out of 10: so:000000) EAT cells, 0.1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was administered subcutaneously (s.c.) to the nape of mice. Then It was awaited for solid tumor formation. AM extract was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) to TG for 17 days to mice. AM extract was found to have a curative effect on areas of inflammation, bleeding, and necrosis in treatment groups treated with AM extract alone. The treatment groups showed nearly normal histological results compared to the positive control group. According to the results, the TPCAM-400 mg/kg group had a more significant histological impact than the TNCAM-200 mg/kg group. In terms of tumor growth, tumor length, tumor volume, and tumor weight, AM extract did not show significant effects. However, in the light of histological findings, promising results of AM were observed in mice in which Ehrlich Solid Tumor was formed.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Liver compresses are commonly applied in complementary medicine during cancer treatment and are believed to have an energizing effect. We conducted a pilot study to investigate the influence of external application of yarrow liver compresses on the autonomous nervous system by analyzing the heart rate variability (HRV) in metastatic cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy and suffering from cancer-related fatigue (CRF). METHODS: A randomized pilot trial was undertaken with patients suffering from CRF receiving palliative radiation therapy for bone or brain metastasis over 2 weeks. CRF patients were randomized into an intervention group receiving yarrow liver compresses and a control group receiving no external application. HRV was analyzed at the beginning (T1) and end (T2) period of the study during daytime (d) and nighttime (n) in both groups and quantified using time-, frequency-, and nonlinear dynamics domains. RESULTS: A total of 39 patients were randomized between September 2017 and August 2019 and a total of 20 patients (10 per group) were available for analysis. For both groups, significant differences in HRV analyses were found in the comparison over the timeline between the first and second measurement (T1d→T2d) during daytime. Specifically, the intervention group showed decreased HRV and complexity of heart rate regulation, indicating increased sympathetic activity at time T2d, whereas the control group showed increased HRV and complexity of heart rate regulation, indicating increased vagal activity at time T2d. Furthermore, the observed HRV analyses showed almost no significant differences between the 2 groups in a direct comparison at the beginning and the end of the study (exception: T2d). CONCLUSIONS: Yarrow liver compresses led to increased sympathetic activity during daytime in the intervention group, whereas in the control group, which did not receive any external application, increased parasympathetic activity was observed.",

Because of the lack of effective treatment and given the approved efficacy of honey and yarrow on sore healing, this study was conducted to evaluate and compare the effects of yarrow, honey, and breast milk on the treatment of nipple fissure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a three-group clinical trial, and sampling was conducted at Sina breastfeeding counseling center from September 2016 to March 2018 in Sirjan, Iran, using a target-based method. The sample size consisted of 150 individuals who were randomly assigned into three groups as topical use of yarrow, the mountain honey, and breast milk after obtaining the written informed consent. The correct method of breastfeeding and using materials were instructed to these three groups on the 1st, 3rd, and 7th days, where the Storr scale was completed by the researcher. RESULTS: Friedman test showed that, in these three groups of yarrow (χ2 = 92.19, df = 2, p < 0.001), honey (χ2 = 93.29, df = 2, p < 0.001), and breast milk (χ2 = 90.51, df = 2, p < 0.001)); severity of fissure had a significant reduction. Nevertheless, Kruskal-Wallis test revealed no significant difference among the severity of fissure scores in these three groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Use of honey, yarrow, and breast milk can be recommended to women in breastfeeding counseling and pharmaceutical companies can be advised to use honey and yarrow in the preparation of anti-fissure creams."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder with indefinite etiology; however, environmental, genetic, immune factors and microbial agents could be implicated in its pathogenesis. UC treatment is lifelong, therefore; the potential side effects and cost of the therapy are significant. Yarrow is a promising medicinal plant with the ability to treat many disorders, owing to its bioactive compounds especially the essential oil. The main aim of this research was to investigate the therapeutic effect of the yarrow oil on colitis including the involved mechanism of action. METHODS: In 21-female C57BL/6 mice were divided into 3 groups; control group, colitis model group, and oil-treated group. Groups 2 and 3 received 5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for 9 days, and concomitantly, only group 3 was given 100 mg/kg yarrow oil. Mice were examined for their body weight, stool consistency and bleeding, and the disease activity indexes were calculated. RESULTS: Oral administration of yarrow oil markedly repressed the severity of UC via the reduction of the inflammatory signs and restoring colon length. The oil was able to down-regulate nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), up-regulate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), and enhance transforming growth factor-β expression. The oil normalized the tumor necrosis factor-α expression, restored the normal serum level of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and reduced the serum level of IL-6. CONCLUSIONS: Yarrow oil mitigated UC symptoms and regulated the inflammatory cytokines secretion via regulation of NF-κB and PPAR-γ pathways in the mice model, however, this recommendation requires further investigations using clinical studies to confirm the use of the oil on humans."

      "abstract": "Nowadays, obesity and its associated metabolic disorders, including diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, or cancer, continue to be a health epidemic in westernized societies, and there is an increased necessity to explore anti-obesity therapies including pharmaceutical and nutraceutical compounds. Considerable attention has been placed on the identification of bioactive compounds from natural sources to manage the metabolic stress associated with obesity. In a previous work, we have demonstrated that a CO2 supercritical fluid extract from yarrow (Yarrow SFE), downregulates the expression of the lipogenic master regulator SREBF1 and its downstream molecular targets FASN and SCD in a tumoral context. Since obesity and diabetes are strongly considered high-risk factors for cancer development, herein, we aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic role of Yarrow SFE in the metabolic stress induced after a high-fat diet in mice. For this purpose, 32 C57BL/6 mice were distributed in four groups according to their diets: standard diet (SD); SD supplemented with Yarrow SFE (SD + Yarrow); high-fat diet (HFD); and HFD supplemented with Yarrow SFE (HFD + Yarrow). Fasting glycemia, insulin levels, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), lipid profile, gene expression, and lipid content of liver and adipose tissues were analyzed after three months of treatment. Results indicate improved fasting glucose levels in plasma, enhanced insulin sensitivity, and diminished hypercholesterolemia in the HFD + Yarrow group compared to the HFD group. Mechanistically, Yarrow SFE protects liver from steatosis after the HFD challenge by augmenting the adipose tissue buffering capacity of the circulating plasma glucose.",

Currently, the altered lipid metabolism in cancer is a topic of interest due to the prominent role of lipids regulating the progression of various types of tumors. Lipids and lipid-derived molecules have been shown to activate growth regulatory pathways and to promote malignancy in pancreatic cancer. In a previous work, we have described the antitumoral properties of Yarrow (Achillea Millefolium) CO2 supercritical extract (Yarrow SFE) in pancreatic cancer. Herein, we aim to investigate the underlaying molecular mechanisms by which Yarrow SFE induces cytotoxicity in pancreatic cancer cells. Yarrow SFE downregulates SREBF1 and downstream molecular targets of this transcription factor, such as fatty acid synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). Importantly, we demonstrate the in vivo effect of Yarrow SFE diminishing the tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model of pancreatic cancer. Our data suggest that Yarrow SFE can be proposed as a complementary adjuvant or nutritional supplement in pancreatic cancer therapy.",

Assessment criteria were as follows: sore throat dynamics at rest and at swallowing, throat irritation associated with cough, general condition, day of withdrawal of antipyretics, the share of treatment responders, as well as assessment of \"therapeutic benefit\" from the use of BNO 1030. RESULTS: Decreased intensity of acute tonsillitis symptoms to 1 point and lower, assessed using 4-point scale starting from the day 5 of treatment (p < 0.005), alleviation of local symptoms and general condition starting from day 2 of the disease (р < 0.001), withdrawal of antipyretics starting from day 4 of treatment (p < 0.005), increase of the number of treatment responders to 81.6% (p < 0.005) versus the control were reported. \"Therapeutic benefit\" was 4.2 days. All patients tolerated phytotherapy well, and no adverse reactions were seen. CONCLUSION: BNO 1030 (Imupret®) is a safe and effective product for treatment of acute non-bacterial tonsillitis in children aged 6-18 years, assuring therapeutic benefit when prescribed additionally to the standard symptomatic therapy.",

In the trial, it was utilized totally 200 common carps with 54.3±6.7 g mean live weight and 15.7±1.8 cm mean total lenght. The 10% rate of the common yarrow (Achillea millefolium Linnaeus) hydrosol; 0.5% rate of the cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume) hydrosol; and 5% rate of the rosemary (Rosemarinus officinalis Linnaeus) hydrosol were applied to fish as a bath treatment. The erythrocyte (RBC), leukocyte count (WBC), hematocrit value (HCT), haemoglobin amount (Hg), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and activities of NBT in the blood samples taken from the caudal vena of the control and experimental fish groups were analyzed in the 7th, 14th, and 21st days of the exposure treatment. At the end of the research, HCT, Hg, RBC, WBC, MCH and MCV values decreased in the C-2 Group (the control group contain pathogen) compared to the C-1 Group (the control group no contain pathogen), except MCHC value. The NBT activities in the C-1 Groups increased at the 14th day, but decreased quite a few at the 21st day. It has been consequently reached the conclusion that the bath treatments of the some plant hydrosols might be beneficial in increasing of antibacterial properties and in strengthening of defense mechanisms of common carp against Y. ruckeri pathogen.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Olive or sunflower oil yarrow extracts have been extensively used against inflammatory disorders and skin wound healing in traditional medicine. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate oil yarrow extracts traditional use in treatment of topical/dermatological skin impairments, sodium lauryl sulfate test was applied, and in vivo measuring of the biophysical parameters (erythema index, skin capacitance and the pH of the skin) in the artificially irritated skin was performed. As traditionally olive and sunflower oil have been used equally for extracts production, the experiment was carried out to investigate whether any of the oil extractants has the advantage over the other, and if the method of extraction might influence the desired activity. The observed activity has been connected to the chemical profile of the investigated extracts and their antioxidative properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vivo measurements were performed using the appropriate probes for measuring skin capacitance, pH of the skin and erythema index (EI). The designed experiment enabled the evaluation of the anti-inflammatory effects of a seven-day application of oil yarrow extracts known in traditional medicine, on artificially irritated skin of volunteers. The chemical profile for the investigated samples was achieved applying the HPLC and UHPLC-MS methods. Also, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) test was performed to assess the antioxidant properties of the investigated samples. RESULTS: The application of tested oil extracts on artificially irritated skin in vivo demonstrated the ability to re-establish their optimal pH and hydration of skin to the values measured prior to the irritation. Considering the EI transition, the investigated samples succeeded in re-establishing the baseline values, with no significant difference after three- and seven-day application. CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained in the study showed that the oil yarrow extracts had an evident anti-inflammatory property. Namely, the investigated extracts demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory effect in an in vivo double blind randomized study, using a sodium lauryl sulfate test. The skin parameters assessed in the study (skin capacitance, pH and EI) were restored to the basal values after three- and seven-day treatment with the tested extracts. The shown effects were attributed to yarrow oil extracts composition. The yarrow oil extracts might be used as promising base in the phytopreparations designed for dermatological application as anti-inflammatory agents with a positive impact on the skin pH and its moisture content.",

Overall the plant growth was strongly enhanced in the second growing season irrespective of radiation treatment. The light environment did not affect total biomass accumulation, but only carbon allocation to leaves or inflorescences. Indeed the phenylpropanoid levels in inflorescences appeared to be more sensitive to the light environment than leaves as the latter showed high constitutive amounts of these compounds. However, the use of polyethylene films improved to some extent the content of caffeic acid derivatives in leaves. Our results showed that yarrow production, in the alpine situation considered, is influenced by the growing season and the light environment, providing a basis to optimize its quality, depending on the concentration of bioactive compounds, by means of proper agronomic practices.",

The aim of the study is to contribute plant extracts to discover new drugs in the diagnosis and treatment of several diseases. METHODS: Nine female and nine male healthy Wistar albino rats, which were approximately 100-150 g in weight, were used for biodistribution studies. For imaging studies four healthy male Balb-C mice were used. Quality control studies were done utilizing thin layer radio chromatography (TLRC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods. For biodistribution studies, (131)I radiolabeled Peak 7 ((131)I-Peak 7) was sterilized and injected into the tail veil of rats and imaging studies were obtained using Kodak FX PRO in vivo Imaging System. RESULTS: The radiolabeling yield of each purified the bioactive extracts of the yarrow plant, seven peaks was between 79 and 92%. The highest radiolabeling yield was calculated for (131)I radiolabeled seventh peak ((131)I-Peak 7) (92.78 ± 5.04, n=5). For this reason the biodistribution and imaging studies were done for (131)I-Peak 7. That's why; these studies with Peak 7 were carried out. CONCLUSION: Peak 7 was radiolabeled with (131)I in high yield for using imaging and therapeutic studies in nuclear medical applications.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a highly prevalent gastrointestinal disorder characterized by alterations in gastric motility. Yarrow (Achillea millefolium L., Fam Asteraceae) preparations are traditional remedies used to treat dyspeptic complaints. Herein, we investigated the effect of a standardized dry water extract obtained from A. millefolium flowering tops (AME) on gastric motility. METHODS: The effect of AME on motility was evaluated on the resting tone of the isolated gastric antrum and on gastric emptying in vivo (phenol red meal method) both in control mice and in the model of cancer chemotherapy (cisplatin)-induced gastric abnormalities. KEY RESULTS: The AME contracted mouse and human gastric strips and this action was unaffected by hexamethonium and tetrodotoxin, but strongly reduced by atropine. Among various chemical ingredients in yarrow, choline, but not the flavonoids rutin and apigenin, mimicked the action of AME. Furthermore, AME deprived of choline did not exert a contractile effect. In vivo, AME stimulated gastric emptying both in control and in cisplatin-treated mice, being more active in pathological states. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: It is concluded that (i) AME exerts a direct spasmogenic effect on gastric antrum; (ii) choline is the chemical ingredient responsible of such effect; (iii) the prokinetic effect of AME observed in vivo could provide the pharmacological basis underlying its traditional use in the treatment of dyspepsia.",

Many investigations are performed to find an effective and safe treatment for leishmaniasis. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of herbal extracts of Thymus vulgaris (Thyme) and Achillea millefolium (Yarrow), propolis hydroalcoholic extract and systemic glucantime against cutaneous leishmaniasis in Balb/c mice. METHODS: A total of 45 mice were randomised into five groups each including nine mice. They were treated with pure ethanol 70 degrees, systemic glucantime, Achillea millefolium hydroalcoholic extract, Thymus vulgaris hydroalcoholic extract and propolis hydroalcoholic extract for six weeks. The statistical tests including student t-test were used for analysis. Data were analyzed by SPSS software, ver 13.00. RESULTS: Mean of ulcer size reduction were -17.66, -22.57, 43.29, 36.09 and 43.77% for the alcohol, glucantime, yarrow, thyme and propolis groups, respectively. The results were suggestive that Thymus vulgaris, Achillea millefolium and propolis hydroalcoholic extracts were significantly more effective in reduction of ulcer size as compared with glucantime (p = 0.006, 0.002 and 0.008, respectively). INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Our results are suggestive that Thymus vulgaris, Achillea millefolium and propolis extracts are effective for treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis in mice. Regarding these results, we suggest that efficacy of these extracts alone or in combination are evaluated against human cutaneous leishmaniasis as a randomized clinical trial.",

      "abstract": "The sex steroid testosterone has been shown to regulate the development of male-specific coloration in many organisms that exhibit sexual dichromatism, but the role of testosterone is less certain for species in which both sexes express bright coloration. Lizards in the genus Sceloporus possess bright blue patches on their throats and abdomens. These patches, which are used in social signaling, are often regulated by testosterone and are consequently expressed only in males of most species. However, Yarrow's Spiny Lizard (Sceloporus jarrovii, Cope 1875) exhibits a derived condition in which both sexes express bright blue ventral patches despite dramatic sexual differences in circulating testosterone levels throughout postnatal ontogeny. In this study, we used surgical castration and hormone replacement in juvenile males to test the hypothesis that testosterone stimulates the expression of blue ventral coloration in S. jarrovii. In two separate experiments conducted in captivity and the natural field environment, we found that surgical castration decreased the hue and saturation while increasing the brightness of blue throat and abdominal patches. Castration also decreased the amount of black pigment bordering the blue throat patch. Treatment of castrated males with exogenous testosterone restored all aspects of ventral coloration to values similar to those of intact control males. Early organizational effects of testosterone during prenatal development may lead to the expression of blue coloration in both sexes, but the results of our present experiments indicate that subsequent effects of testosterone during sexual maturation further enhance the coloration of males.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Yarrow (Achillea millefolium) is used for the treatment of diarrhea, as a urinary antiseptic, hypotensive, and diuretic. Yarrow also has traditionally been used as an abortifacient, emmenagogue, contraceptive, and for stimulating uterine contractions. For this reason, it is contra-indicated for use in pregnancy. There has, however, been little scientific research carried out to either confirm or refute this recommendation. METHODS: Female rats were dosed, orally by gavage using 56 times the human dose of yarrow daily on either gestation days (GD) 1-8 or GD 8-15. Two groups of controls were included; the first received water and the second received an equivalent dose of ethanol to that found in the yarrow preparation over the two gestation periods. On GD 20, rats were sacrificed, placentae were weighed, and corpora lutea counted. The fetuses were weighed and examined for signs of external, internal or skeletal malformations. RESULTS: The dose used was not materno-toxic. There was no increase in pre- or post-implantation losses suggesting that yarrow was neither an abortifacient nor a contraceptive. Placental weights were increased in rats treated with yarrow on GD 8-15 compared to water and ethanol controls and on GD 1-8 compared to water control fetuses. Body weight was reduced in fetuses exposed to yarrow on GD 8-15 compared to water control fetuses. There was no difference in incidence of external or internal malformations. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study it was found that yarrow, when administered to rats at 56 times the human dose, was associated with reduced fetal weight and increased placental weight. In the absence of a no observable effect level for these variables it must be concluded that the consumption of yarrow is contraindicated during pregnancy until further investigations have been carried out.",
