      "abstract": "Water-soluble B vitamins, mainly obtained through dietary intake of fruits, vegetables, grains, and dairy products, act as co-factors in various biochemical processes, including DNA synthesis, repair, methylation, and energy metabolism. These vitamins include B1 (Thiamine), B2 (Riboflavin), B3 (Niacin), B5 (Pantothenic Acid), B6 (Pyridoxine), B7 (Biotin), B9 (Folate), and B12 (Cobalamin). Recent studies have shown that besides their fundamental physiological roles, B vitamins influence oncogenic metabolic pathways, including glycolysis (Warburg effect), mitochondrial function, and nucleotide biosynthesis. Although deficiencies in these vitamins are associated with several complications, emerging evidence suggests that excessive intake of specific B vitamins may also contribute to cancer progression and interfere with therapy due to impaired metabolic and genetic functions. This review discusses the tumor-suppressive and tumor-progressive roles of B vitamins in cancer. It also explores the recent evidence on a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between B vitamin metabolism and cancer progression and underscores the need for further research to determine the optimal balance of B vitamin intake for cancer prevention and therapy.",

      "abstract": "Three pyridine-3-formyl chitosan derivatives were successfully prepared, and the preservation performance of the derivatives was examined. According to the results, the derivatives exhibited better antifungal and antioxidant properties than that of chitosan. At a supply concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, 2-ANACS could scavenge DPPH radicals at a rate of (92.82 ± 0.38)%. Additionally, all three derivatives exhibited less cytotoxicity and higher biocompatibility. In the freshness preservation studies of cherry tomatoes, the three derivatives considerably decreased the weight loss rate and postponed the drop in VC and titratable acid content. After 32 days of 2.0 g/L VPPCS treatment, the weight loss of cherry tomatoes was (4.0 ± 0.52) % among them. Still, the weight loss of cherry tomato in the chitosan treatment and blank control was (5.5 ± 1.33) % and (5.94 ± 1.02) %, respectively, which was considerably decreased by VPPCS therapy. These findings demonstrated that adding niacin improved chitosan's antifungal and antioxidant properties, extended the shelf life of cherry tomatoes, and increased the potential uses of chitosan and its derivatives in fruit preservation.",

      "abstract": "Niacin, a key component of pyridine nucleotides, plays a vital role in over 200 metabolic reactions, including carbohydrate, lipid, and AA metabolism. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of niacin supplementation on lactational performance in dairy cows. We hypothesized that niacin supplementation during the transition or lactation period would enhance the productive performance of dairy cows. A systematic review identified 41 experiments, comprising 128 treatment means and 1,992 cows, which were included in the meta-analysis. Each experiment featured a nonsupplemented control (CON) group and a supplemented group, with niacin provided as either rumen-unprotected niacin (RUPN) or rumen-protected niacin (RPN). Supplementation was initiated during either the transition or lactation period, resulting in the categorization of data into 4 distinct cohorts: cows supplemented with RUPN or RPN during either the transition or lactation period. Cows supplemented with RUPN during the transition (CON; n = 13 treatment means vs. RUPN; n = 14 treatment means) and lactation periods (CON; n = 33 treatment means vs. RUPN; n = 40 treatment means) had average niacin intakes (mean ± SD) of 13.9 ± 10.8 g/d and 9.1 ± 3.5 g/d, respectively. Cows supplemented with RPN during the transition (CON; n = 4 treatment means vs. RPN; n = 4 treatment means) and lactation periods (CON; n = 8 treatment means vs. RPN; n = 12 treatment means) had niacin intakes of 11.7 ± 7.3 g/d and 4.6 ± 2.0 g/d, respectively. Mixed models were used to investigate the linear and quadratic effects of RUPN or RPN. Meta-analytical statistics in STATA estimated the weighted mean difference (WMD) of milk yield for treatment comparisons (CON vs. RUPN and CON vs. RPN). All models included the random effect of experiment and weighting by the inverse of the SEM squared. Supplementation of niacin, whether RUPN or RPN, during the transition period did not improve performance in dairy cows. However, RUPN supplementation during the regular lactation period led to linear increases in DMI, yields of milk, ECM, protein and lactose, and increments of 0.50, 0.90, 0.70, 0.04, and 0.05 kg/d, respectively, were observed when cows were supplemented with 9.1 g/d RUPN. In 38 treatment comparisons from 20 experiments evaluating RUPN supplementation during the lactation period, the mean response indicated that RUPN cows produced 0.83 kg/d more milk than CON cows (WMD = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.35-1.31), with moderate (I2 = 61.7%) heterogeneity observed. Similarly, RPN supplementation during the lactation period led to linear increases in DMI and yields of milk, ECM, fat and lactose, with respective increases of 0.60, 1.10, 0.70, 0.06, and 0.05 kg/d when cows were supplemented with 4.7 g/d niacin. Across 12 treatment comparisons from 8 experiments, RPN-supplemented cows produced 0.96 kg/d more milk than CON cows (WMD = 0.96; 95% CI = 0.62-1.31), with no heterogeneity observed. Overall, feeding 9.1 g/d of niacin from RUPN or 4.7 g/d of niacin from RPN during the lactation period improved milk production without improving feed efficiency in dairy cows.",

Treatment options for this condition remain limited to date. Nonetheless, two lines of research endeavor in the past decade have shown encouraging results worthy of further investigations. First, therapeutic hypoxia appears to improve neurological outcomes, which is somewhat counterintuitive but supported by preclinical evidence. Furthermore, nicotinic acid or nicotinamide riboside could be an adjunctive therapy that enhances the neuroprotective effect of hypoxia. Second, preclinical studies and preliminary clinical experience suggest that sildenafil is potentially disease-modifying for Leigh syndrome. Sildenafil has already been used to treat pulmonary hypertension, and its repurposing for Leigh syndrome has been endorsed by European Medicines Agency. This perspective aims to raise awareness about these progresses, as well as to call for more clinical studies to ensure safe and effective implementation of these treatment approaches in clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nicotinic acid (niacin, Vitamin B3) is one of the most effective medicines for improving high-density lipoprotein concentrations. Obesity and related diseases are life-threatening to dogs. This study investigated the niacin effect on triglyceride, cholesterol, lipoproteins, thyroid hormones, oxidative stress, and lipid peroxidation in intact adult dogs. Blood samples were taken from seven healthy, intact adult dogs as a control group (day 0). Then, the animals received 1000 mg/dog of oral nicotinic acid tab daily for 42 days, and blood sampling was performed on days 14, 28, 42, and 56. RESULT: The results showed an increasing trend in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentration. The highest HDL concentration (138.85 ± 43.72 mg/dl) was related to day 56; the HDL level followed a statistically significant increase between day 14 and 56. Unlike HDL, there was a decreasing trend in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentration. The lowest LDL concentration (21.85 ± 18.60 mg/dl) was related to day 56. The concentration of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA1) was significantly increased during the study. The highest concentration of apoA1 (1.66 ± 0.06 g/l) was on day 42. There was a significant increase in apoA1 concentrations between days 0 and 14, 42, and 56. The apoA1 was significantly increased between days 14 and 42 and 56. The apoA1 followed a statistically significant increase between days 28 and 42. Changes in thyroid hormone levels did not show any constant increasing or decreasing trend. On day 14, a decreasing trend in the concentrations of TT4, FT4, and T3 was observed. However, an increasing trend was detected in the concentrations of TT4, FT4, and T3 on days 28 and 42. However, the increase in the concentrations of TT4 and FT4 was less than that on day 0. After treatment (day 56), a decreasing trend was observed in thyroid hormone concentrations. The negative correlation was detected between apoA1 and triiodothyronine (T3), total thyroxine T4 (TT4)), and free T4 (FT4) concentrations on day 42. Furthermore, a significant negative relationship was observed between HDL and T4 on day 42. However, the relationship between triglyceride and T3 was statistically positive on day 14. There was an increasing trend in serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC). The highest TAC concentration (3.83 ± 0.62 µmol /l) was on day 56; however, the malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration was decreased during the study. The total antioxidant level followed a statistically significant increase between days 0 and 56 compared to days 14 and 42. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated the efficacy of nicotinic acid in improving serum HDL, apoA1, and TAC, as well as decreasing serum MDA and LDL concentrations.",

      "abstract": "Lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) includes a diverse group of pharmaceuticals designed to reduce blood levels of cholesterol and triglyceride (TG), helping to prevent cardiovascular diseases like myocardial infarction and stroke. LLT includes treatment with several lipid-lowering drugs (LLD), including hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statin), PCSK9 Inhibitors, cholesterol-absorbing inhibitors (Ezetimibe), Bile Acid Sequestrants, Fibrates, Niacin (Vitamin B3), Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Bempedoic Acid, and combination therapy. The efficacy and safety of these molecules vary widely. Statins are the first-line LLD for treating hypercholesterolemia and are widely used for cardiovascular disease prevention. Common side effects include muscle-related issues such as myalgia, muscle atrophy, and, rarely, rhabdomyolysis. However, adverse effects on male reproductive health are infrequent and often underreported. Other medication classes employed in LLT mostly share many of the ADRs seen with statins, although individual classes may have unique ADRs depending on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Here, we are reporting a unique case of a 50-year-old male patient with no prior history of sexual dysfunction or testicular issues and other comorbidities or habits, who developed loss of libido, erectile dysfunction (ED) and testicular pain with most of the LLD, which promptly resolved on discontinuation of the LLT. This case highlights the importance of considering potential reproductive side effects when prescribing LLT and monitoring male patients for symptoms of sexual dysfunction."

      "abstract": "B vitamins, including niacin (vitamin B3), are synthesized by rumen microbes, but supplementation may provide additional benefits for ruminant health and productivity. Supplementing rumen-protected niacin (RPN) during the transition period can reduce lipolysis after calving and, consequently, may improve health and fertility of dairy cattle later in lactation. Our objective was to determine if supplementing RPN during the first 21 DIM would improve the health of dairy cows on a commercial dairy farm. We hypothesized that RPN would reduce mastitis, improve fertility, and reduce risk of leaving the herd during lactation. Holstein cows were blocked by parity and projected calving date, with treatments randomly assigned to cows within each block. Cows received RPN (n = 481; 26 g/d) through a supplement dispenser in the automated milk systems (AMS) in addition to their robot pellet, or the robot pellet only (CON; n = 593). Treatments were applied for the first 21 DIM, and cows were followed for the rest of their lactation. Milk yield, milk components (wk 1-3 of lactation), pre- and postpartum BCS, health records, and reproductive records were collected. Blood was collected from a random subset of 99 cows at 3 DIM and 97 cows at 10 DIM to assess plasma concentrations of niacin, metabolic biomarkers, and biomarkers of inflammatory status. Culling, proportion of cows pregnant, and mastitis risk were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard models. Mastitis incidence was analyzed with a linear mixed model and conception risk was analyzed using a χ2 test. Supplementing RPN increased plasma nicotinamide concentration by 1,740 nM ± 410.0 nM (SE; 50% increase), but it did not affect plasma nicotinic acid concentrations. Supplementing RPN reduced plasma insulin concentrations at 3 and 10 DIM across all parities. Circulating BHB and free fatty acid concentrations were greater for cows receiving RPN; the effect was greatest in cows in third or greater parity. Plasma haptoglobin was not affected by treatment. Rumen-protected niacin increased milk yield for first- and second-parity cows by wk 9 and 13 of lactation, respectively, and increased milk yield in those groups was sustained for the rest of lactation, resulting in 658 ± 259.4 kg and 675 ± 308.9 kg more milk for RPN-supplemented first- and second-parity cows. The risk of leaving the herd, mastitis incidence, and probability of pregnancy were not affected by RPN. Inquiries into the effects of RPN supplementation and its timing on metabolism are necessary to understand optimal supplementation strategies for RPN in dairy cattle.",

      "abstract": "Candida tropicalis-a prevalent gut commensal fungus in healthy individuals - contributes to intestinal health and disease. However, how commensal C. tropicalis influences intestinal homeostasis and barrier function is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that the reference strain of C. tropicalis (MYA-3404) ameliorated intestinal inflammation in murine models of chemically induced colitis and bacterial infection. Intestinal colonization of C. tropicalis robustly upregulated the expression of IL-17A and IL-22 to increase barrier function and promote proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells in the mouse colon. Metabolomics analysis of fecal samples from mice colonized with C. tropicalis revealed alterations in vitamin B3 metabolism, promoting conversion of nicotinamide to nicotinic acid. Although nicotinamide worsened colitis, treatment with nicotinic acid alleviated disease symptoms and enhanced epithelial proliferation and Th17 cell differentiation. Oral gavage of C. tropicalis mitigated nicotinamide-induced intestinal dysfunction in experimental colitis. Blockade of nicotinic acid production with nicotinamidase inhibitors lowered the protective effects against colitis in mice treated with C. tropicalis. Notably, a clinical C. tropicalis strain isolated from patients with candidemia lacked the protective effects against murine colitis observed with the reference strain. Together, our results highlight a novel role for C. tropicalis in resolving intestinal inflammation through the modulation of vitamin B3 metabolism.",

      "abstract": "In the previous study, the culture medium was treated with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) under the hypothesis that NAD+ regeneration is a major factor causing excessive lactate accumulation in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The NAD+ treatment improved metabolism by not only reducing the Warburg effect but also enhancing oxidative phosphorylation, leading to enhanced antibody production. Building on this, four NAD+ precursors - nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide riboside (NR), and nicotinamide (NAM) - were tested to elevate intracellular NAD+ levels more economically. First, the ability of CHO cells to utilize both the salvage and Preiss-Handler pathways for NAD+ biosynthesis was verified, and then the effect of NAD+ precursors on CHO cell cultures was evaluated. These precursors increased intracellular NAD+ levels by up to 70.6% compared to the non-treated group. Culture analysis confirmed that all the precursors induced metabolic changes and that NMN, NA, and NR improved productivity akin to NAD+ treatment, with comparable integral viable cell density. Despite the positive effects such as the increase in the specific productivity and changes in cellular glucose metabolism, none of the precursors surpassed direct NAD+ treatment in antibody titer, presumably due to the reduction in nucleoside availability, as evidenced by the decrease in ATP levels in the NAD+ precursor-treated groups. These results underscore the complexity of cellular metabolism as well as the necessity for further investigation to optimize NAD+ precursor treatment strategies, potentially with the supplementation of nucleoside precursors. Our findings suggest a feasible approach for improving CHO cell culture performances by using NAD+ precursors as medium and feed components for the biopharmaceutical production.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases and involves various pathogenic mechanisms, including oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Niacin, an important cofactor in mitochondrial energy metabolism, may play a key role in the pathogenesis of PD. An in-depth exploration of the relationship between niacin and mitochondrial energy metabolism may provide new targets for the treatment of PD. The present study was designed to examine the association between dietary niacin intake and the risk of PD in US adults. Data from adults aged 40 years and older collected during cycles of the United States (US) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2005 to 2018 were used. A multiple logistic regression model was used to analyze the relationship between dietary niacin intake and the risk of PD. Further linear tests using restricted cubic splines (RCS) were performed to explore the shape of the dose-response relationship. Subgroup stratification and interaction analyses were conducted according to years of education, marital status, smoking, and hypertension to evaluate the stability of the association between different subgroups. A total of 20,211 participants were included in this study, of which 192 were diagnosed with PD. In the fully adjusted multiple logistic regression model, dietary niacin intake was negatively associated with the risk of PD (OR: 0.77, 95%CI: 0.6-0.99; p = 0.042). In the RCS linear test, the occurrence of PD was negatively correlated with dietary niacin intake (nonlinearity: p = 0.232). In stratified analyses, dietary niacin intake was more strongly associated with PD and acted as an important protective factor in patients with fewer years of education (OR: 0.35, 95%CI: 0.13-0.93), married or cohabitating (OR: 0.71, 95%CI: 0.5-0.99), taking dietary supplements (OR: 0.6, 95%CI: 0.37 0.97), non-smokers (OR: 0.57, 95%CI: 0.39-0.85), those with hypertension (OR: 0.63, 95%CI: 0.63-0.95), coronary artery disease (OR: 0.77, 95%CI: 0.6-1), and stroke (OR: 0.75, 95%CI: 0.88-0.98), but the interaction was not statistically significant in all subgroups. Dietary niacin intake was inversely associated with PD risk in US adults, with a 23% reduction in risk for each 10 mg increase in niacin intake."

A severe deficiency of this vitamin can lead to pellagra, which is characterized by dermatitis, dementia, diarrhoea and eventually death if untreated. A 68-year-old woman with a poor socioeconomic background presented with photosensitive dermatitis, fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea. Her urine changed to port wine colour following sun exposure. Porphyria cutanea tarda was excluded in the absence of demonstrable urine spectrophotometry. A diagnosis of pellagra was made, and timely management led to a complete cure. Proper diagnosis and effective treatment of pellagra are imperative as this condition can be life-threatening if left untreated."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: NAXE-encephalopathy or early-onset progressive encephalopathy with brain edema and/or leukoencephalopathy-1 (PEBEL-1) and NAXD-encephalopathy (PEBEL-2) have been described recently as mitochondrial disorders causing psychomotor regression, hypotonia, ataxia, quadriparesis, ophthalmoparesis, respiratory insufficiency, encephalopathy, and seizures with the onset being usually within the first three years of life. It usually leads to rapid disease progression and death in early childhood. Anecdotal reports suggest that niacin, through its role in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotinde (NAD) de novo synthesis, corrects biochemical derangement, and slows down disease progression. Reports so far have supported this observation. METHODS: We describe a patient with a confirmed PEBEL-1 diagnosis and report his clinical response to niacin therapy. Moreover, we systematically searched the literature for PEBEL-1 and PEBEL-2 patients treated with niacin and details about response to treatment and clinical data were reviewed. Furthermore, we are describing off-label use of a COX2 inhibitor to treat niacin-related urticaria in NAXE-encephalopathy. RESULTS: So far, seven patients with PEBEL-1 and PEBEL-2 treated with niacin were reported, and all patients showed a good response for therapy or stabilization of symptoms. We report a patient exhibiting PEBEL-1 with an unfavorable outcome despite showing initial stabilization and receiving the highest dose of niacin reported to date. Niacin therapy failed to halt disease progression or attain stabilization of the disease in this patient. CONCLUSION: Despite previous positive results for niacin supplementation in patients with PEBEL-1 and PEBEL-2, this is the first report of a patient with PEBEL-1 who deteriorated to fatal outcome despite being started on the highest dose of niacin therapy reported to date."

The control group (CON) was provided a basal diet +3.3 g/d of sodium selenite (purity1%), whereas the nanoselenium group (NSe) was offered the same diet +10 mL/d of nanoselenium (selenium concentration 1,500 mg/L). The results showed that NSe significantly increased the milk yield, milk selenium content, and feed efficiency (p < 0.05), but had no significant effect on other milk components (p > 0.05). NSe significantly increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (p < 0.05), but had no significant effects on malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), blood total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), or blood selenium (p > 0.05). In addition, the nontargeted metabolomics of the milk was determined by LC-MS technology, and the differentially abundant metabolites and their enrichment pathways were screened. According to these findings, NSe considerably increased the contents of cetylmannoside, undecylenoic acid, 3-hydroxypentadecanoic acid, 16-hydroxypentadecanoic acid, threonic acid, etc., but decreased the contents of galactaric acid, mesaconic acid, CDP-glucose etc. Furthermore, the enriched metabolic pathways that were screened with an impact value greater than 0.1 included metabolism of niacin and niacinamide, pyruvate, citrate cycle, riboflavin, glycerophospholipid, butanoate and tyrosine. Pearson correlation analysis also revealed a relationship between different milk metabolites and blood selenium, as well as between milk selenium and blood biochemical indices. In conclusion, compared with sodium selenite, nanoselenium improves the milk yield, feed efficiency, and milk selenium content of dairy cows and regulates milk metabolites and related metabolic pathways in Holstein dairy cows during the peak lactation period, which has certain application prospects in dairy production."

Those who are physically active in stressful environments, such as warm and/or humid scenarios, may be at particular risk for dehydration with ensuing loss of electrolytes, leading to sluggishness and impaired physical performance. METHODS: We evaluated an electrolyte and amino acid product containing L-alanine and L-glutamine, as well as select vitamins [B3 (niacin), B5 (pantothenic acid), B6 (pyridoxine), B12 (cobalamin), and vitamin C (ascorbic acid)]. Subjects (n = 40; four groups, n = 10) were randomized to consume either a placebo packet or one, two, or three packets daily of the test product for 4 weeks with site visits at 0, 2, and 4 weeks. We tested safety and tolerability by analyzing hematological parameters (complete blood counts), metabolic parameters (hepatic, renal, acid-base balance), urinalysis end products, thyroid status [T3 (triiodothyronine), T4 (thyroxine), TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone)], tolerability (via questionnaire), vital signs, and dietary intake. RESULTS: Statistical analyses displayed ten significant main effects (p < 0.05) with white blood cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils, urinary pH, thyroxine, urination frequency, calcium, calories, fat, and cholesterol. Interactions for time and group (p < 0.05) were observed for MCV, eGFR, potassium, overall tolerability, bloating, and cramping-demonstrating mild GA disturbances. Little to no change of physiological relevance was noted for any outcome variable, regardless of dosing level. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate the product was well-tolerated at all dosing levels and no significant adverse changes occurred in any of the test parameters compared to the placebo group, indicating relative safety of ingestion over a 4-week treatment period, at the volumes used, and outside the context of physical stress.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Hyperphosphatemia is a common complication in patients with kidney failure, despite the use of phosphate binders. Vitamin B3, either in the form of niacin or niacinamide (NAM), shows potential as \"add-on\" treatment to reduce serum phosphate concentrations in this population. NAM seems to lack many of the side effects that are observed with niacin. The aim of this study was to investigate whether NAM is an effective and acceptable treatment in reducing serum phosphate concentrations in patients with kidney failure. METHODS: DiaNia was a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized crossover trial, comparing NAM (250-500 mg/day) to placebo as \"add-on\" treatment to an individual treatment with approved phosphate binders for 12 weeks in patients receiving hemodialysis. The primary outcome was serum phosphate concentrations, and the secondary outcomes were platelet counts as well as drop-outs due to side effects. Data were analyzed using both per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses. RESULTS: Mean age of the per-protocol population (n = 26) was 63.6 ± 17.2 years and 53.8% were men. NAM treatment significantly reduced serum phosphate with 0.59 mg/dL (p = .03). Linear mixed-effects models demonstrated superiority of 12 weeks NAM over 12 weeks placebo with a between-treatment difference of 0.77 mg/dL (95% CI 0.010, 1.43; P = .03). Similar results, although not significant, were found in the intention-to-treat population. We found no between-treatment differences in platelet counts and during the NAM treatment we observed 3 drop-outs due to side effects (8.6%). CONCLUSION: NAM is effective in reducing serum phosphate concentrations in patients with kidney failure receiving hemodialysis. In addition, NAM is well-tolerated and seems not to increase the risk of thrombocytopenia. Thus, NAM can be valuable as \"add-on\" treatment to combat hyperphosphatemia in patients with kidney failure. However, more research in larger populations is needed to confirm this.",

      "abstract": "The addiction of tumors to elevated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels is a hallmark of cancer metabolism. Obstructing NAD+ biosynthesis in tumors is a new and promising antineoplastic strategy. Inhibitors developed against nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), the main enzyme in NAD+ production from nicotinamide, elicited robust anticancer activity in preclinical models but not in patients, implying that other NAD+-biosynthetic pathways are also active in tumors and provide sufficient NAD+ amounts despite NAMPT obstruction. Recent studies show that NAD+ biosynthesis through the so-called \"Preiss-Handler (PH) pathway\", which utilizes nicotinate as a precursor, actively operates in many tumors and accounts for tumor resistance to NAMPT inhibitors. The PH pathway consists of three sequential enzymatic steps that are catalyzed by nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT), nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferases (NMNATs), and NAD+ synthetase (NADSYN1). Here, we focus on these enzymes as emerging targets in cancer drug discovery, summarizing their reported inhibitors and describing their current or potential exploitation as anticancer agents. Finally, we also focus on additional NAD+-producing enzymes acting in alternative NAD+-producing routes that could also be relevant in tumors and thus become viable targets for drug discovery.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nicotinamide is the active form of vitamin B3 (niacin) obtained through endogenous synthesis, mainly through tryptophan metabolism and dietary supplements, fish, meats, grains, and dairy products. It participates in cellular energy metabolism and modulates multiple cellular survival and death pathways. Nicotinamide has been widely studied as a safe chemopreventive agent that reduces actinic keratosis (AKs) and non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC). METHODS: We used the Medline, EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane databases to search the concepts \"nicotinamide\", \"chemoprevention\", and \"skin cancer\" up to August 2023. Three independent authors screened titles and abstracts for intervention and study design before searching full texts for eligibility criteria. The primary outcome was the impact of oral nicotinamide on the incidence of NMSC in high-risk patients. We also conducted a systematic search to identify relevant epidemiological studies published evaluating dietary niacin intake and the risk of NMSC. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-five studies were reviewed, and four met the inclusion criteria. There was no association between NAM consumption and risk for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (rate ratio (RR) 0.81, 95% CI 0.48-1.37; I2 = 0%), basal cell carcinoma (BCC) (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.50-1.55; I2 = 63%), and NMSC (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61-1.12; I2 = 63%). Adverse events were rare and acceptable, allowing optimal compliance of patients to the treatment. We found only one article evaluating the association between niacin dietary intake and NMSC risk, supporting a potential beneficial role of niacin intake concerning SCC but not BCC or melanoma. CONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analysis shows, by pooling immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients, that there is insufficient evidence that oral nicotinamide therapy significantly reduces the number of keratinocyte cancers.",

      "abstract": "Recently, more and more studies have revealed that iron overload can lead to osteoporosis by inducing oxidative stress. Niacin (NAN), also known as nicotinate or vitamin B3, has been confirmed to possess potent antioxidative effects. In addition, very little is currently known about the protective effects of NAN on iron overload in osteoporotic bone tissue. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the protective effect of niacin on iron overload-induced bone injury and to investigate the effect and underlying mechanisms of the niacin and iron overload on intracellular antioxidant properties. When MC3T3-E1 and RAW264.7 cells were cultured in the presence of ammonium ferric citrate(FAC), NAN therapy could increase the matrix mineralization and promote expression of osteogenic markers in MC3T3-E1, inhibit osteoclastic differentiation of RAW264.7 cells, while increasing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and strengthening mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). In the ovariectomized (OVX) rat model, NAN had an obvious protective effect against iron-overloaded injury. Meanwhile, superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), intracellular antioxidant enzymes and silent information regulator type 1 (SIRT1), were up-regulated in response to NAN exposures in MC3T3-E1. Furthermore, SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 attenuated the protective effects of NAN. Results revealed that NAN could stimulate osteogenic differentiation, inhibit osteoclastic differentiation and markedly increased antioxidant properties in cells through the induction of SIRT1. Studies suggest that niacin is a promising agent for preventing bone loss in iron overload conditions.",

      "abstract": "Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the principal staple food, a fundamental component of food security, a significant source of energy and major nutrients, and a key player in the overall nutritional status in Bangladesh. Parboiling is a common rice-processing treatment in Bangladesh. Recently, polishing has also become a common practice among millers seeking to attract consumers. Polishing may influence the nutrient composition of rice. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of parboiling and polishing on the nutritional content of the five High Yield Varieties (HYVs) of rice (BR11, BRRI dhan28, BRRI dhan29, BRRI dhan49, and BRRI dhan84) and their percent contributions to the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) of vitamins and minerals. All of the rice samples were analyzed for proximate parameters, vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B6, and folate), and minerals (Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, Na, K, P). Moisture, ash, fat, and total dietary fiber (TDF) were determined gravimetrically, according to the AOAC Official Methods; protein was measured by the Kjeldahl method; B-group vitamins were measured using Ultra Pressure Liquid Chromatography; and mineral content was determined by ICP-OES. The energy, protein, fat, and total dietary fiber (TDF) content of the samples ranged between 342-357 kcal/100 g, 6.79-10.74 g/100 g, 0.31-1.69 g/100 g, and 2.59-3.92 g/100 g respectively. Thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxin, and folate content ranged from 0.11-0.25 mg/100 g, 0.01-0.05 mg/100 g, 2.82-6.42 mg/100 g, 0.12-0.30 g/100 g, and 5.40-23.95 g/100 g respectively. In a comparison of parboiling and polishing, macronutrients and vitamin retention were higher in parboiled unpolished rice than in polished unparboiled rice. The minerals (mg/100 g) Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, Na, K, and P were in the ranges 32.82-44.72, 30.69-58.34, 0.51-0.70,1.83-2.79, 5.00-5.36, 106.49-112.73, and 162.23-298.03. Minerals of BRRI dhan84 were unaffected by polishing and parboiling. BRRI dhan84 contributed a higher percentage of RDA of all B vitamins and minerals. Therefore, to reduce nutrient loss in rice, industries and consumers should be encouraged to avoid polishing or limit polishing to 10% DOM and to consume unpolished rice, either parboiled or unparboiled."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since the association between dietary quality scores and semen quality remains unclear, we carried out a hospital-based cross-sectional study to investigate the association of Dietary Total Antioxidant Capacity (dTAC), Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII), and Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) scores with semen quality in men seeking infertility treatment. METHODS: This study enrolled 210 men with unexplained or idiopathic infertility. Semen samples were collected and analyzed according to the WHO 2010 criteria. Dietary data was collected using a 168-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) developed for Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the relationship between dTAC, AHEI, and DII scores with abnormal semen in crude and adjusted models. RESULTS: There were no significant differences across quartile categories of the dTAC, AHEI, and DII scores regarding semen parameters. There was a trend toward a significant direct association between DII and abnormal semen risk (p = 0.01). Infertile men in the highest quartile of DII had a 2.84 times higher risk of abnormal semen in the crude model (OR: 3.84; 95% CI: 1.64-8.95); such that remained after adjusting for several potential confounders. There was no significant association between dTAC or AHEI and the risk of abnormal semen in infertile men, either before or after adjusting for potential confounders. Total energy (p = 0.05), fat (p = 0.02), saturated fat (p = 0.02), mono-saturated fat (p = 0.009), Thiamine (Vitamin B1) (p = 0.02), Niacin (Vitamin B3) (p = 0.03), Calcium (p = 0.01), and Selenium (p = 0.01) were inversely associated with semen normality. DISCUSSION: The study suggests that certain dietary factors may affect semen quality, and the mechanisms underlying the observed associations are likely multifactorial, involving complex interactions between diet, oxidative stress, inflammation, and hormone levels. Further research is required to confirm the results, fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying the associations, and identify specific dietary interventions that may improve male fertility outcomes."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a serious global public health issue. Blood pressure (BP) is still not effectively controlled in about 20 - 30% of hypertensive patients. Therefore, it is imperative to develop new treatments for hypertension. Veratrum alkaloids were once used for the clinical treatment of hypertension, the mechanism of which is still unclear. It was gradually phased out due to adverse reactions. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the short-term and long-term hypotensive profiles of different components of Veratrum alkaloids in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) to unveil their mechanisms of action. RESULTS: Total Veratrum alkaloid (V), component A (A), and veratramine (M) quickly decreased BP within 30 min of treatment, reduced renal and cardiovascular damage, and improved relevant biochemical indicators (nitric oxide [NO], endothelin-1 [ET-1], angiotensin II [Ang II)], noradrenaline [NE], etc) in SHRs to delay stroke occurrence. Thereinto, A exhibited excellent protective effects in cardiovascular disease. The metabolomic profiles of SHRs treated with V, A, and M were significantly different from those of SHRs treated with vehicle. Thirteen metabolites were identified as potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers. Through Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis, V, A, and M-induced hypotension was mainly related to alterations in nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, GABAergic synapses, linoleic acid metabolism, ketone body synthesis and degradation, arginine and proline metabolism, and urea cycle, of which nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism was the key metabolic pathway to relieve hypertension. CONCLUSION: This work shows that A is an effective and promising antihypertensive agent for hypertension treatment to reduce BP and hypertensive target organ damage, which is mainly mediated through modulating nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, RAS, and NO-ET homeostasis.",

      "abstract": "The oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a critical metabolite for living cells. NAD+ may act either as a cofactor for many cellular reactions as well as a coenzyme for different NAD+-consuming enzymes involved in the physiological homeostasis of different organs and systems. In mammals, NAD+ is synthesized from either tryptophan or other vitamin B3 intermediates that act as NAD+ precursors. Recent research suggests that NAD+ precursors play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the gut barrier. Indeed, its deficiency has been associated with enhanced gut inflammation and leakage, and dysbiosis. Conversely, NAD+-increasing therapies may confer protection against intestinal inflammation in experimental conditions and human patients, with accumulating evidence indicating that such favorable effects could be, at least in part, mediated by concomitant changes in the composition of intestinal microbiota. However, the mechanisms by which NAD+-based treatments affect the microbiota are still poorly understood. In this context, we have focused specifically on the impact of NAD+ deficiency on intestinal inflammation and dysbiosis in animal and human models. We have further explored the relationship between NAD+ and improved host intestinal metabolism and immunity and the composition of microbiota in vivo. Overall, this comprehensive review aims to provide a new perspective on the effect of NAD+-increasing strategies on host intestinal physiology.",

Recent evidence has posited niacin as a promising therapeutic for several neurological disorders. In this review, we discuss the biochemistry of niacin, including its homeostatic roles in NAD+ supplementation and metabolism. Niacin also has roles outside of metabolism, largely through engaging hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (Hcar2). These receptor-mediated activities of niacin include regulation of immune responses, phagocytosis of myelin debris after demyelination or of amyloid beta in models of Alzheimer's disease, and cholesterol efflux from cells. We describe the neurological disorders in which niacin has been investigated or has been proposed as a candidate medication. These are multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, glioblastoma and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Finally, we explore the proposed mechanisms through which niacin may ameliorate neuropathology. While several questions remain, the prospect of niacin as a therapeutic to alleviate neurological impairment is promising.",

It manifests especially with energy and mitochondrial metabolism aberrations that promote tissue wasting. We recently identified nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) loss to associate with muscle mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer hosts. In this study we confirm that depletion of NAD+ and downregulation of Nrk2, an NAD+ biosynthetic enzyme, are common features of severe cachexia in different mouse models. Testing NAD+ repletion therapy in cachectic mice reveals that NAD+ precursor, vitamin B3 niacin, efficiently corrects tissue NAD+ levels, improves mitochondrial metabolism and ameliorates cancer- and chemotherapy-induced cachexia. In a clinical setting, we show that muscle NRK2 is downregulated in cancer patients. The low expression of NRK2 correlates with metabolic abnormalities underscoring the significance of NAD+ in the pathophysiology of human cancer cachexia. Overall, our results propose NAD+ metabolism as a therapy target for cachectic cancer patients.",

      "abstract": "Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection often causes acute hepatitis, which results in a case fatality rate of 0.2% and fulminant hepatitis in 0.5% of cases. However, no specific potent anti-HAV drug is available on the market to date. In the present study, we focused on inhibition of HAV internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-mediated translation and investigated novel therapeutic drugs through drug repurposing by screening for inhibitors of HAV IRES-mediated translation and cell viability using a reporter assay and cell viability assay, respectively. The initial screening of 1,158 drugs resulted in 77 candidate drugs. Among them, nicotinamide significantly inhibited HAV HA11-1299 genotype IIIA replication in Huh7 cells. This promising drug also inhibited HAV HM175 genotype IB subgenomic replicon and HAV HA11-1299 genotype IIIA replication in a dose-dependent manner. In the present study, we found that nicotinamide inhibited the activation of activator protein 1 (AP-1) and that knockdown of c-Jun, which is one of the components of AP-1, inhibited HAV HM175 genotype IB IRES-mediated translation and HAV HA11-1299 genotype IIIA and HAV HM175 genotype IB replication. Taken together, the results showed that nicotinamide inhibited c-Jun, resulting in the suppression of HAV IRES-mediated translation and HAV replication, and therefore, it could be useful for the treatment of HAV infection. IMPORTANCE Drug screening methods targeting HAV IRES-mediated translation with reporter assays are attractive and useful for drug repurposing. Nicotinamide (vitamin B3, niacin) has been shown to effectively inhibit HAV replication. Transcription complex activator protein 1 (AP-1) plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of cellular immunity or viral replication. The results of this study provide evidence that AP-1 is involved in HAV replication and plays a role in the HAV life cycle. In addition, nicotinamide was shown to suppress HAV replication partly by inhibiting AP-1 activity and HAV IRES-mediated translation. Nicotinamide may be useful for the control of acute HAV infection by inhibiting cellular AP-1 activity during HAV infection processes.",

Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is the chronic condition and most common form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus. AIMS: Current therapies of DLE are challenging and not completely satisfactory, highly expensive, off-label, or poorly available (like antimalarials due to COVID-19 outbreaks). Nicotinamide, also called niacinamide, is a water-soluble form of vitamin B3 (niacin). Its multiple effects let us think that nicotinamide could be a therapy for lupus-associated skin lesions. METHODS: We performed a prospective randomized double-blind clinical trial on 60 subjects diagnosed with Discoid lupus erythematosus using topical Nicotinamide 2% and 4% preparations in form of cream and gel on skin and scalp lesions. Control group was included using only cream/gel base as placebo control. RESULTS: Obtained data showed that topical Nicotinamide can be used for the treatment of DLE as adjuvant to other treatment regimens with good cosmetic results and minimal side effects. Topical 4% Nicotinamide is superior to 2% preparation in response but associated with a higher incidence of irritation. CONCLUSION: Topical Nicotinamide can be used for the treatment of DLE as an adjuvant to other treatment regimens with good cosmetic results and minimal side effects. Further trials with long-term therapy, follow-up period, and bigger sample sizes are required.",

However, the relationship and mechanism between rotator cuff injury and osteoporosis are unclear. Therefore, to investigate association between rotator cuff injury and osteoporosis, and find clinical characteristics, bone mineral density, bone metabolism markers, and nutrient levels in rotator cuff injury patients with or without osteoporosis. METHODS: One hundred and four cases of patients (RCTs, n=32; RCTs-OP, n=72) who underwent rotator cuff injury and need arthroscopic rotator cuff repair between June 2021 and February 2022, along with the diagnosis of osteoporosis were identified from the dual-energy X-ray bone density screening(DXA). The outcome measure includes clinical characteristics, bone mineral density, bone metabolism markers, vitamins, and amino acids. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was applied to build a predicting model incorporating the feature selected in the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression model. Discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness of the predicting model were assessed using the C-index, calibration plot, and decision curve analysis. Internal validation was assessed using bootstrapping validation. RESULTS: OP with RCTs has a lower level of in 25-vitD, osteocalcin (OCN), serum Ca2+, ornithine, diaminocaproic_acid but the high level of Vitamin_B12, PTH, Vitamin_D3,γ_aminobutyric_acid, Vitamin_C and Vitamin_E than RCTs patients without OP. Predictors contained in the prediction nomogram included lumber T score, femur T score, Niacin_B3, and vitamin D, reflecting the combined effect of vitamins on RCTs-related OP progression. The model has good discriminative ability with a C-index of 0.938(95% CI:-1.83-1.39) and good scaling ability. The high C-index value of 0.95 is still achievable with range validation. Analysis of decision curves showed that non-adherence is clinically useful when intervention decisions are at the 14% probability limit of non-adherence. CONCLUSION: This study supports the hypothesis that lumber T score, femur T score, Niacin_B3, and Vitamin D are valuable prognostic biomarkers on RCTs related OP progression. WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE SUBJECT: It is found that vitamin D are valuable prognostic biomarkers, reflecting the combined effect of vitamins on RCTs related OP progression. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE: These findings also highlight that nutrients condition such as vitamins and amino acids of patients provide a new understanding of the development of RCTs.",

Candidate factors have included NAD+ itself, its reduced form NADH, nicotinamide (NAM), nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), nicotinamide riboside (NR), and niacin (or nicotinic acid). This review summarises the research findings for each source of cognitive impairment for which NAD+ precursor supplementation has been investigated as a therapy. The findings are mostly positive but have been made primarily in animal models, with some reports of null or adverse effects. Given the increasing popularity and availability of these factors as nutritional supplements, further properly controlled clinical research is needed to provide definitive answers regarding this strategy's likely impact on human cognitive health when used to address different sources of impairment.",

METHODS: HypoE22 cells and isolated hypothalamic specimens were selected as in vitro models to conduct the experiments. The efficacy of citicoline, CAVAQ10, and vitamin B3, with their fixed combination, were assayed after the exposure of hypothalamic cells to hydrogen peroxide (concentration range 1 nM-10 µM), in order to evaluate the biocompatibility of treatments. The activity of neuroprotective and pro-inflammatory factors, namely, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), involved in the neuronal cell damage in neurodegenerative diseases, were assayed in isolated hypothalamus. RESULTS: Neither citicoline, CAVAQ10, nor vitamin B3 significantly altered hypothalamic cell viability, thus suggesting the biocompatibility of single ingredients and fixed combination in the concentration range considered for the study. In the same condition, citicoline and CAVAQ10 were also effective in reducing the gene expression of monoaminoxidase-B, involved in dopamine degradation. However, only citicoline demonstrated an ability to reduce dopamine levels. Conversely, all compounds were effective in reducing the gene expression of IL-6, and TNFα, and in inducing the gene expression of BDNF, with the co-administration of citicoline/CAVAQ10/vitamin B3 being generally more effective than single ingredients. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings support the beneficial and synergistic effects of citicoline, CAVAQ10, and vitamin B3 in fixed combination in reducing inflammation and oxidation, and in stimulating neurotrophin production in neuronal cells.",

      "abstract": "The last decade has seen a strong proliferation of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of metabolic and age-related diseases based on increasing cellular NAD+ bioavailability. Among them, the dietary supplementation with NAD+ precursors-classically known as vitamin B3-has received most of the attention. Multiple molecules can act as NAD+ precursors through independent biosynthetic routes. Interestingly, eukaryote organisms have conserved a remarkable ability to utilize all of these different molecules, even if some of them are scarcely found in nature. Here, we discuss the possibility that the conservation of all of these biosynthetic pathways through evolution occurred because the different NAD+ precursors might serve specialized purposes."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pellagra is caused by niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency and patients with pellagra present with a characteristic rash. Isoniazid disrupts intracellular niacin synthesis and might induce niacin deficiency. In 2017, Malawi scaled up continuous isoniazid preventive treatment (IPT) for tuberculosis prevention among people living with HIV. In addition, an under-diversified diet based on subsistence maize, as is commonly the case in Malawi, is a risk factor for pellagra. We aimed to investigate whether large-scale isoniazid exposure in Malawi contributed to the cumulative risk for pellagra in a nutritionally vulnerable population. METHODS: We did a matched case-control study to evaluate the association between daily, continuous isoniazid exposure and pellagra. We matched sequentially enrolled patients with pellagra each with four control participants by sex and age from referral dermatology centres in three IPT scale-up districts in Malawi (Lilongwe, Blantyre, and Zomba) to evaluate isoniazid as a risk for pellagra using multivariable conditional logistic regression. We established a community clinic referral system surrounding the dermatology clinic in each district to enhance case-finding and included all patients with pellagra, regardless of referral status. The primary outcome was dermatologist-diagnosed pellagra. We calculated the interval between isoniazid initiation and rash onset and assessed 30-day clinical outcomes after multi-B vitamin treatment containing 300 mg nicotinamide daily. FINDINGS: Between Feb 5 and Aug 9, 2019, we enrolled 197 patients with pellagra and 781 matched controls. Isoniazid exposure was associated with an increased risk of pellagra (adjusted odds ratio 42·6 [95% CI 13·3-136·6]). Significant covariates included HIV infection, referral status, food insecurity, underweight, excess alcohol consumption, and, among women, lactation. The median time from isoniazid initiation to rash onset was shorter during the season of food scarcity (5 months [IQR 3-7]) compared with the harvest season (9 months [8-11]; hazard ratio 7·2 [95% CI 3·2-16·2], log-rank p<0·0001). Those with isoniazid-associated pellagra who discontinued isoniazid and adhered to multi-B vitamin treatment showed 30-day clinical improvement. INTERPRETATION: Continuous IPT scale-up and the annual period of food scarcity both increased the risk of pellagra in Malawi. Use of shorter rifamycin-based regimens for tuberculosis prevention and food fortification in populations with undernutrition might reduce this risk. Niacin-containing multi-B vitamin co-administration with isoniazid as pellagra prevention is worth exploring further. FUNDING: This study was supported by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief through the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under project 7173.",

      "abstract": "Metabolic dysregulation is an important hallmark of cancer. Nicotinamide (NAM), a water-soluble amide form of niacin (vitamin B3), is currently available as a supplement for maintaining general physiologic functions. NAM is a crucial regulator of mitochondrial metabolism and redox reactions. In this study, we aimed to identify the mechanistic link between NAM-induced metabolic regulation and the therapeutic efficacy of NAM in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The combined analysis using multiomics systems biology showed that NAM decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production, but increased the activities of reverse electron transport (RET), fatty acid β-oxidation and glycerophospholipid/sphingolipid metabolic pathways in TNBC, collectively leading to an increase in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The increased ROS levels triggered apoptosis and suppressed tumour growth and metastasis of TNBC in both human organoids and xenograft mouse models. Our results showed that NAM treatment leads to cancer cell death in TNBC via mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of ROS by bifurcating metabolic pathways (RET and lipid metabolism); this provides insights into the repositioning of NAM supplement as a next-generation anti-metabolic agent for TNBC treatment.",

      "abstract": "Impaired mitochondrial function is associated with several metabolic diseases and health conditions, including insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2DM), as well as ageing. The close relationship between the above-mentioned diseases and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (diabetic cardiomyopathy and age-related cardiovascular diseases) has long been known. Mitochondria have a crucial role: they are a primary source of energy produced in the form of ATP via fatty acid oxidation, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and electron transport chain (ETC), and ATP synthase acts as a key regulator of cardiomyocyte survival. Mitochondrial medicine has been increasingly discussed as a promising therapeutic approach in the treatment of CVD. It is well known that vitamin B3 as an NAD+ precursor exists in several forms, e.g., nicotinic acid (niacin) and nicotinamide (NAM). These cofactors are central to cellular homeostasis, mitochondrial respiration, ATP production, and reactive oxygen species generation and inhibition. Increasing evidence suggests that the nicotinic acid derivative BGP-15 ((3-piperidine-2-hydroxy-1-propyl)-nicotinic amidoxime) improves cardiac function by reducing the incidence of arrhythmias and improves diastolic function in different animal models. Our team has valid reasons to assume that these cardioprotective effects of BGP-15 are based on its NAD+ precursor property. Our hypothesis was supported by an animal experiment where ageing ZDF rats were treated with BGP-15 for one year. Haemodynamic variables were measured with echocardiography to detect diabetic cardiomyopathy (DbCM) and age-related CVD as well. In the ZDF group, advanced HF was diagnosed, whereas the BGP-15-treated ZDF group showed diastolic dysfunction only. The significant difference between the two groups was supported by post-mortem Haematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Masson's trichrome staining of cardiac tissues. Moreover, our hypothesis was further confirmed by the significantly elevated Cytochrome c oxidase (MTCO) and ATP synthase activity and expression detected with ELISA and Western blot analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the protective effect of BGP-15 on cardiac mitochondrial respiration in an ageing ZDF model."

      "abstract": "This study aimed at exploring the possibility of substituting powdered milk (PM) with migratory locust powder (MLP) as a cheap and sustainable alternative protein source in peanut-based ready-to-use therapeutic foods used in treatment of malnutrition. The migratory locust is a wide spread and underutilised high protein edible insect. Peanut-based ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTFs) were formulated according to the MSF/UNICEF 2013 nutritional standards. Milk powder was substituted with MLP at 5-30% levels. RUTF containing 30% milk powder was used as the control. Nutritional, antioxidant and antinutrients composition of the insect-enriched RUTFs were compared with RUTF containing milk powder only and a standard. The protein content of the insect-enriched RUTFs ranged from 19.58-26.38% exceeding the MSF/UNICEF minimum standard for protein. RUTF with 10% PM and 20% MLP had the highest (p < 0.05) mineral contents. All formulations had more thiamine (vitamin B1) than the recommended level of 0.5 mg/100 g. Niacin (Vitamin B3) was the most abundant vitamin in the formulations with considerable amounts of vitamin D and E. All MLP-enriched RUTFs met the FAO 2011 standard requirements for amino acids for children aged six months to three years. Therapeutic food with 30% MLP had the highest radical scavenging ability against DPPH, and iron chelating activity. Levels of phytate and tannin were below the tolerable limits. Therefore, MLP can be used as a low-cost substitute for milk powder in producing ready-to-use therapeutic foods.",

However, NAM supplementation aiming at repleting NAD+ did not replete kidney NAD+ and did not improve glomerular filtration or reduce histological injury in ischaemic-reperfusion kidney injury in mice. The lack of improvement of kidney injury is partially at odds with prior reports that did not study kidney NAD+, glomerular filtration or histology in NAM-treated wild-type mice with AKI. We now present an overview of research on therapy with vitamin B3 vitamers and derivate molecules {niacin, Nicotinamide [NAM; niacinamide], NAM riboside [Nicotinamide riboside (NR)], Reduced nicotinamide riboside [NRH] and NAM mononucleotide} in kidney injury, including an overview of ongoing clinical trials, and discuss the potential explanations for diverging reports on the impact of these therapeutic approaches on pre-clinical acute and chronic kidney disease."

Its manifestations are dermatitis with pronounced photosensitivity, gastrointestinal symptoms, and neuropsychiatric ailments. Currently pellagra is developed in people who chronically abuse alcohol or are treated with medications from specific pharmacological groups (immunosuppressive and anti-tuberculosis drugs). Although the root cause of the disease was established in the mid-twentieth century, a detailed explanation of the processes leading to the development of symptoms has not yet been proposed. They include complex abnormalities at the molecular, metabolic, and immunological levels. Diagnostics is based primarily on the clinical presentation of the disease, while auxiliary tests play secondary role. The low prevalence of the disease, meaning that physicians are unfamiliar with its recognition, often leads to delays in diagnosis and appropriate treatment. The therapy is causal and based on administering niacinamide. Failure to implement treatment in the early stages of the disease leads to the patient's death. The aim of this literature review is to summarize the current state of knowledge on the pathomechanisms of pellagra, highlighting the clinical implications, and key elements of diagnostic and therapeutic management that are important in the treatment of pellagra patients.",

      "abstract": "Vitamin B3 (nicotinic acid, niacin) deficiency causes the systemic disease pellagra, which leads to dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia, and possibly death depending on its severity and duration. Vitamin B3 is used in the synthesis of the NAD+ family of coenzymes, contributing to cellular energy metabolism and defense systems. Although nicotinamide (niacinamide) is primarily used as a nutritional supplement for vitamin B3, its pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical uses have been extensively explored. In this review, we discuss the biological activities and cosmeceutical properties of nicotinamide in consideration of its metabolic pathways. Supplementation of nicotinamide restores cellular NAD+ pool and mitochondrial energetics, attenuates oxidative stress and inflammatory response, enhances extracellular matrix and skin barrier, and inhibits the pigmentation process in the skin. Topical treatment of nicotinamide, alone or in combination with other active ingredients, reduces the progression of skin aging and hyperpigmentation in clinical trials. Topically applied nicotinamide is well tolerated by the skin. Currently, there is no convincing evidence that nicotinamide has specific molecular targets for controlling skin aging and pigmentation. This substance is presumed to contribute to maintaining skin homeostasis by regulating the redox status of cells along with various metabolites produced from it. Thus, it is suggested that nicotinamide will be useful as a cosmeceutical ingredient to attenuate skin aging and hyperpigmentation, especially in the elderly or patients with reduced NAD+ pool in the skin due to internal or external stressors."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Boosting NAD+ via supplementation with niacin equivalents has been proposed as a potential modality capable of promoting healthy aging and negating age-dependent declines of skeletal muscle mass and function. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the efficacy of NAD+-precursor supplementation (tryptophan, nicotinic acid, and nicotinamide) on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function in physically compromised older adults. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was conducted in 14 (female/male: 4/10) community-dwelling, older adults with impaired physical function [age, 72.9 ± 4.0 years; BMI, 25.2 ± 2.3 kg/m2]. Participants were supplemented with 207.5 mg niacin equivalents/day [intervention (INT)] and a control product (CON) that did not contain niacin equivalents, each for 32 days. The primary outcomes tested were mitochondrial oxidative capacity and exercise efficiency, analyzed by means of paired Student's t-tests. Secondary outcomes, such as NAD+ concentrations, were analyzed accordingly. RESULTS: Following supplementation, skeletal muscle NAD+ concentrations [7.5 ± 1.9 compared with 7.9 ± 1.6 AU, respectively] in INT compared with CON conditions were not significantly different compared to the control condition, whereas skeletal muscle methyl-nicotinamide levels were significantly higher under NAD+-precursor supplementation [INT, 0.098 ± 0.063 compared with CON, 0.025 ± 0.014; P = 0.001], suggesting an increased NAD+ metabolism. Conversely, neither ADP-stimulated [INT, 82.1 ± 19.0 compared with CON, 84.0 ± 19.2; P = 0.716] nor maximally uncoupled mitochondrial respiration [INT, 103.4 ± 30.7 compared with CON, 108.7 ± 33.4; P = 0.495] improved under NAD+-precursor supplementation, nor did net exercise efficiency during the submaximal cycling test [INT, 20.2 ± 2.77 compared with CON, 20.8 ± 2.88; P = 0.342]. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are consistent with previous findings on NAD+ efficacy in humans, and we show in community-dwelling, older adults with impaired physical function that NAD+-precursor supplementation through L-tryptophan, nicotinic acid, and nicotinamide does not improve mitochondrial or skeletal muscle function.

It is also recently reported as a novel kinase inhibitor with multiple targets. Nicotinamide promotes pancreatic cell differentiation from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs).

In order to understand the molecular mechanism involved in pancreatic cell fate determination, we analyzed the downstream pathways of nicotinamide in the derivation of NKX6.1+ pancreatic progenitors from hESCs. METHODS: We applied downstream modulators of nicotinamide during the induction from posterior foregut to pancreatic progenitors, including niacin, PARP inhibitor, SIRT inhibitor, CK1 inhibitor and ROCK inhibitor. The impact of those treatments was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR, flow cytometry and immunostaining of pancreatic markers. Furthermore, CK1 isoforms were knocked down to validate CK1 function in the induction of pancreatic progenitors. Finally, RNA-seq was used to demonstrate pancreatic induction on the transcriptomic level. RESULTS: First, we demonstrated that nicotinamide promoted pancreatic progenitor differentiation in chemically defined conditions, but it did not act through either niacin-associated metabolism or the inhibition of PARP and SIRT pathways. In contrast, nicotinamide modulated differentiation through CK1 and ROCK inhibition. We demonstrated that CK1 inhibitors promoted the generation of PDX1/NKX6.1 double-positive pancreatic progenitor cells. shRNA knockdown revealed that the inhibition of CK1α and CK1ε promoted pancreatic progenitor differentiation. We then showed that nicotinamide also improved pancreatic progenitor differentiation through ROCK inhibition. Finally, RNA-seq data showed that CK1 and ROCK inhibition led to pancreatic gene expression, similar to nicotinamide treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In this report, we revealed that nicotinamide promotes generation of pancreatic progenitors from hESCs through CK1 and ROCK inhibition. Furthermore, we discovered the novel role of CK1 in pancreatic cell fate determination.",

      "abstract": "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an essential redox cofactor, but it also acts as a substrate for NAD-consuming enzymes, regulating cellular events such as DNA repair and gene expression. Since such processes are fundamental to support cancer cell survival and proliferation, sustained NAD production is a hallmark of many types of neoplasms. Depleting intratumor NAD levels, mainly through interference with the NAD-biosynthetic machinery, has emerged as a promising anti-cancer strategy. NAD can be generated from tryptophan or nicotinic acid. In addition, the \"salvage pathway\" of NAD production, which uses nicotinamide, a byproduct of NAD degradation, as a substrate, is also widely active in mammalian cells and appears to be highly exploited by a subset of human cancers. In fact, research has mainly focused on inhibiting the key enzyme of the latter NAD production route, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), leading to the identification of numerous inhibitors, including FK866 and CHS-828. Unfortunately, the clinical activity of these agents proved limited, suggesting that the approaches for targeting NAD production in tumors need to be refined. In this contribution, we highlight the recent advancements in this field, including an overview of the NAD-lowering compounds that have been reported so far and the related in vitro and in vivo studies. We also describe the key NAD-producing pathways and their regulation in cancer cells. Finally, we summarize the approaches that have been explored to optimize the therapeutic response to NAMPT inhibitors in cancer.",

      "abstract": "Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, has a pivotal role in energy metabolism, cellular signaling cascades regulating gene expression, and apoptosis. However, the effect of Niacin on porcine early embryo developmental competence remains to be elucidated. The present study aimed to assess the effects of Niacin treatment during in vitro maturation (IVM) on the nuclear maturation of porcine oocytes and subsequent development of in vitro embryos. In addition, the expression profiles of selected genes related to lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and apoptosis were assessed. The IVM medium was supplemented with different concentrations of Niacin (0, 300, 600, and 900 μM). The results showed that a high concentration of Niacin (900 μM) significantly decreased cumulus expansion compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). No significant difference was observed among the experimental groups for nuclear maturation rate. Niacin treatments (300, 600, and 900 μM) during IVM significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced glutathione levels. Treatment with 300 and 600 μM significantly (p < 0.05) lowered the reactive oxygen species levels compared to treatment with 900 μM and the control group. Niacin supplementation to the IVM media significantly improved the cleavage and blastocyst rates compared to the control group. Supplementation with 300 and 600 μM of Niacin significantly increased the total cell number of blastocysts compared to supplementation with 900 μM or the control groups. Cytoplasmic lipid droplets were significantly reduced after 600 μM treatment. Supplementation of Niacin to IVM media positively affected the relative expression of genes related to energy and oxidative status (SIRT1), pro-apoptosis (BAX), anti-apoptosis (BCL2), and lipid metabolism (ACACA and PNPLA2) in cumulus cells and oocytes. Taken together, Niacin supplementation to porcine IVM media improved the developmental competence of early embryos mainly through protection against oxidative stress and its influence on energy metabolism and apoptosis pathways.",

METHODS: Twelve young female water polo players (except goalkeepers) from Shanxi Province were selected. A 4-week formal training was started after 1 week of acclimatization according to experimental requirements. Urine samples (5 mL) were collected before formal training, early morning after 4 weeks of training, and immediately after 4 weeks of training matches, and labeled as T1, T2, and T3, respectively. The samples were tested by LC-MS after pre-treatment. XCMS, SIMCA-P 14.1, and SPSS16.0 were used to process the data and identify differential metabolites. RESULTS: On comparing the immediate post-competition period with the pre-training period (T3 vs. T1), 24 differential metabolites involved in 16 metabolic pathways were identified, among which niacin and niacinamide metabolism and purine metabolism were potential post-competition urinary metabolic pathways in the untrained state of the athletes. On comparing the immediate post-competition period with the post-training period (T3 vs. T2), 10 metabolites involved in three metabolic pathways were identified, among which niacin and niacinamide metabolism was a potential target urinary metabolic pathway for the athletes after training. Niacinamide, 1-methylnicotinamide, 2-pyridone, L-Gln, AMP, and Hx were involved in two metabolic pathways before and after the training. CONCLUSION: Differential changes in urine after water polo games are due to changes in the metabolic pathways of niacin and niacinamide."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), an essential cofactor for mitochondrial function, declines with aging, which may lead to impaired physical performance. Nicotinamide riboside (NR), a NAD+ precursor, restores cellular NAD+ levels. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of short-term NR supplementation on physical performance in middle-aged mice and the effects on mouse and human muscle stem cells. METHODS: We treated 15-mo-old male C57BL/6J mice with NR at 300 mg·kg·d-1 (NR3), 600 mg·kg·d-1 (NR6), or placebo (PLB), n = 8 per group, and assessed changes in physical performance, muscle histology, and NAD+ content after 4 wk of treatment. RESULTS: NR increased total NAD+ in muscle tissue (NR3 P = 0.01; NR6 P = 0.004, both versus PLB), enhanced treadmill endurance and open-field activity, and prevented decline in grip strength. Histologic analysis revealed NR-treated mice exhibited enlarged slow-twitch fibers (NR6 versus PLB P = 0.014; NR3 P = 0.16) and a trend toward more slow fibers (NR3 P = 0.14; NR6 P = 0.22). We next carried out experiments to characterize NR effects on mitochondrial activity and cellular energetics in vitro. We observed that NR boosted basal and maximal cellular aerobic and anaerobic respiration in both mouse and human myoblasts and human myotubes. Additionally, NR treatment improved the differentiating capacity of myoblasts and increased myotube size and fusion index upon stimulation of these progenitors to form multinucleated myotubes. CONCLUSION: These findings support a role for NR in improving cellular energetics and functional capacity in mice, which support the translation of this work into clinical settings as a strategy for improving and/or maintaining health span during aging.",

      "abstract": "Divergent pathways of macrophage metabolism occur during infection, notably switching between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis (Warburg-like metabolism). Concurrently, macrophages shift between alternate and classical activation. A key enzyme upregulated in alternatively activated macrophages is indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, which converts tryptophan to kynurenine for de novo synthesis of nicotinamide. Nicotinamide can be used to replenish cellular NAD+ supplies. We hypothesize that an insufficient cellular NAD+ supply is the root cause of metabolic shifts in macrophages. We assert that manipulation of nicotinamide pathways may correct deleterious immune responses.

A reduction diet with a low glycaemic index (GI) has proved to support the treatment of PCOS. The aim of the study was to analyse the influence of the diet on the level of vitamins soluble in water. The study included 55 women, 40 of which suffered from PCOS (identified by means of the Rotterdam Criteria) and 15 healthy women of the Caucasian race. The level of vitamins before and after the dietary intervention was measured. The diet was a reduction diet with a reduced glycaemic index (GI). Biochemical analyses were made on the basis of liquid chromatography-Infinity 1260 Binary liquid chromatography (LC) Agilent Technology. The level of vitamins in the serum was analysed together with the consumption before and after the dietary intervention. A higher level of vitamin C in the plasma was observed before and after the dietary intervention in the PCOS group in comparison to the control group despite the lower intake of this vitamin in the PCOS group. The remaining vitamins were at a comparable or lower level (B1, B3, B5, B6 and B12). After the dietary intervention, only B1 and B9 were at a clearly lower level (a trend of p = 0.093 and p = 0.085). A properly balanced reduction diet with reduced GI improves the supply of vitamins in women with PCOS. An additional recommendation should be the additional supplementation of B1, niacinamide and the combination of folates with inositol. The level of vitamin C in the plasma may not be a good marker of its supply in the PCOS group.",

This study was based on our previous reports that stated that the combination treatment of N1-methylnicotinamide (MNA) and hydralazine (HYD) improves fatty liver in NAFL model rats. This finding was attributed to the MNA metabolism inhibition by HYD, which is a strong inhibitor of aldehyde oxidase (AO); this results in an increase in hepatic MNA and improved fatty liver. We hypothesized that orally administered nicotinamide (NAM), which is the precursor of MNA and is a form of niacin, would be efficiently metabolized by nicotinamide N-methyltransferase in the presence of exogenous S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) in NAFL rats. To address this issue, NAFL model rats were orally administered with NAM, SAM, and/or HYD. As a result, liver triglyceride (TG) and lipid droplet levels were barely altered by the administration of NAM, SAM, NAM+SAM, or NAM+HYD. By contrast, the triple combination of NAM+SAM+HYD significantly reduced hepatic TG and lipid droplet levels and significantly increased hepatic MNA levels. These findings indicated that the combination of exogenous SAM with AO inhibitors, such as HYD, has beneficial effects for improving fatty liver with NAM.",

Niacin (vitamin B3) could control the excess of tryptophan depletion and represents a potential strategy to improve immune functions and CD4 count recovery in immunological non-responder HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART). METHODS: Methods: In the CTN PT006 phase 2 pilot randomized trial, 20 adults on ART with CD4 ≤ 350 cells/µl, despite an undetectable viral load (VL) for at least 3 months, received 2000 mg of extended-release (ER)-niacin orally once daily for 24 weeks. Side effects, VL, CD4/CD8 counts, lipid profile, T-cell activation and senescence, Tregs and Th17 cell frequencies, Kyn/Trp ratio, and levels of IL-6, IP-10, sST2, I-FABP, and LBP were assessed following ER-niacin treatment. RESULTS: Results: Thirteen participants completed the study. Treatment was interrupted in 4 patients due to loss of follow-up or personal reasons and 3 patients were discontinued due to comorbidity risks. All participants maintained a VL < 40 copies/ml, while ER-niacin did not affect CD4 and CD8 cell counts. Plasma levels of triglycerides, total, and LDL cholesterol significantly decreased, following ER-niacin treatment. ER-niacin also diminished Kyn plasma levels and slightly decreased CD4 T-cell activation. However, no improvement in CD8 subsets, Kyn/Trp ratio, Th17/Treg balance, and plasma inflammatory markers was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusions: Although ER-niacin combined with ART was well-tolerated among immune non-responders and decreased plasma lipids, it did not improve systemic inflammation, Kyn/Trp ratio, and CD4 cell recovery. Overall, ER-niacin was not effective to overcome chronic inflammation in PLWH.",

      "abstract": "Statins are a class of lipid-lowering medications that reduce illness and mortality in those who are at a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease. They are the most common cholesterol-lowering drugs. A case control study published in 2002 indicated that statins may increase the risk of peripheral neuropathy. Statin users were 14-fold more likely to develop peripheral neuropathy than non-users, although the overall risk of developing neuropathy was minimal. However, a number of other studies have produced conflicting results regarding neuropathy and statins. Statins are frequently combined with niacin (vitamin B3). Due to its beneficial effects on lipid profiles, niacin has been prescribed for the prevention of heart disease for >40 years. Among the B vitamins, niacin has long been recognized as a key mediator of neuronal development and survival, and may be of value for the treatment of neuropathy. The present study aimed to assess whether the combination of niacin and statin may reduce the risk of peripheral neuropathy attributed to statins. For this purpose, data from MedWatch, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program were analyzed. The online tool OpenVigil 2.1 was used to query the databases. The results revealed that the majority of statins alone were related to neuropathy. Pitavastatin was the only exception. The association with neuropathy was most pronounced in the lipophilic statins: Atorvastatin and fluvastatin. The association was weaker for other lipophilic statins, such as lovastatin and simvastatin. Two hydrophilic statins, rosuvastatin and pravastatin, exhibited a similarly weaker association with neuropathy, while no reports of any association of pitavastatin with neuropathy were found. Statins + niacin were unrelated to neuropathy. On the whole, the findings of the present study demonstrate that the controversial association of statins with neuropathy may be due to the fact that previous studies have not included the use of niacin and the potential neuroprotective effects of niacin. Multiple reports have stated that niacin is no longer beneficial for the management of hyperlipidemia and should be abandoned. However, given the apparent ability of niacin to reduce the risk of neuropathy, perhaps niacin should not be discarded before further studies are performed to provide more in depth information."

In 2017, Malawian clinicians recognized a high incidence of pellagra-like rashes after scale-up of isoniazid preventive treatment (IPT) to people living with HIV (PLHIV). This increase in pellagra incidence among PLHIV coincided with a seasonal period of sustained food insecurity in the region, which obscured epidemiological interpretations. Although isoniazid has been implicated as a secondary cause of pellagra for decades, no hypothesis-driven epidemiological study has assessed this relationship in a population exposed to isoniazid. We developed this case-control protocol to assess the association between large-scale isoniazid distribution and pellagra in Malawi. Methods: We measure the relative odds of having pellagra among isoniazid-exposed people compared to those without exposure while controlling for other pellagra risk factors. Secondary aims include measuring time from isoniazid initiation to onset of dermatitis, comparing niacin metabolites 1-methylnicotinamide (1-MN), and l-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2-PYR) in urine as a proxy for total body niacin status among subpopulations, and describing clinical outcomes after 30-days multi-B vitamin (containing 300 mg nicotinamide daily) therapy and isoniazid cessation (if exposed). We aim to enroll 197 participants with pellagra and 788 age- and sex-matched controls (1:4 ratio) presenting at three dermatology clinics. Four randomly selected community clinics within 3-25 km of designated dermatology clinics will refer persons with pellagra-like symptoms to one of the study enrollment sites for diagnosis. Trained study dermatologists will conduct a detailed exposure questionnaire and perform anthropometric measurements. A subset of enrollees will provide a casual urine specimen for niacin metabolites quantification and/or point-of-care isoniazid detection to confirm whether participants recently ingested isoniazid. We will use conditional logistic regression, matching age and sex, to estimate odds ratios for the primary study aim. Discussion: The results of this study will inform the programmatic scale-up of isoniazid-containing regimens to prevent tuberculosis.",

Despite its favorable safety profile and affordability, the integration of nicotinamide into clinical practice is an ongoing process, and like many over-the-counter supplements it has faced some barriers. The purpose of this article is to address some of those barriers by reviewing its efficacy, safety profile, and emphasizing the difference between nicotinamide and niacin. Lastly, we offer practical guidance around recommendations and the availability of nicotinamide, which can be hard to find for patients and providers alike.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Treatments for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma are poorly effective, at least partly due to the tumor's immune-suppressive stromal compartment. New evidence of positive effects on immune responses in the tumor microenvironment (TME), compelled us to test the combination of gemcitabine (GEM), a standard chemotherapeutic for pancreatic cancer, with nicotinamide (NAM), the amide form of niacin (vitamin B3), in mice with pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Various mouse tumor models of pancreatic cancer, that is, orthotopic Panc-02 and KPC (KrasG12D, p53R172H, Pdx1-Cre) grafts, were treated alternately with NAM and GEM for 2 weeks, and the effects on efficacy, survival, stromal architecture and tumor-infiltrating immune cells was examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC), flow cytometry, Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT), T cell depletions in vivo, Nanostring analysis and RNAscope. RESULTS: A significant reduction in tumor weight and number of metastases was found, as well as a significant improved survival of the NAM+GEM group compared with all control groups. IHC and flow cytometry showed a significant decrease in tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the tumors of NAM+GEM-treated mice. This correlated with a significant increase in the number of CD4 and CD8 T cells of NAM+GEM-treated tumors, and CD4 and CD8 T cell responses to tumor-associated antigen survivin, most likely through epitope spreading. In vivo depletions of T cells demonstrated the involvement of CD4 T cells in the eradication of the tumor by NAM+GEM treatment. In addition, remodeling of the tumor stroma was observed with decreased collagen I and lower expression of hyaluronic acid binding protein, reorganization of the immune cells into lymph node like structures and CD31 positive vessels. Expression profiling for a panel of immuno-oncology genes revealed significant changes in genes involved in migration and activation of T cells, attraction of dendritic cells and epitope spreading. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential of NAM+GEM as immunotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Even though new therapies are available against melanoma, novel approaches are needed to overcome resistance and high-toxicity issues. In the present study the anti-melanoma activity of Nicotinamide (NAM), the amide form of Niacin, was assessed in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Human (A375, SK-MEL-28) and mouse (B16-F10) melanoma cell lines were used for in vitro investigations. Viability, cell-death, cell-cycle distribution, apoptosis, Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide+ (NAD+), Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) levels were measured after NAM treatment. NAM anti-SIRT2 activity was tested in vitro; SIRT2 expression level was investigated by in silico transcriptomic analyses. Melanoma growth in vivo was measured in thirty-five C57BL/6 mice injected subcutaneously with B16-F10 melanoma cells and treated intraperitoneally with NAM. Interferon (IFN)-γ-secreting murine cells were counted with ELISPOT assay. Cytokine/chemokine plasmatic levels were measured by xMAP technology. Niacin receptors expression in human melanoma samples was also investigated by in silico transcriptomic analyses. RESULTS: NAM reduced up to 90% melanoma cell number and induced: i) accumulation in G1-phase (40% increase), ii) reduction in S- and G2-phase (about 50% decrease), iii) a 10-fold increase of cell-death and 2.5-fold increase of apoptosis in sub-G1 phase, iv) a significant increase of NAD+, ATP, and ROS levels, v) a strong inhibition of SIRT2 activity in vitro. NAM significantly delayed tumor growth in vivo (p ≤ 0.0005) and improved survival of melanoma-bearing mice (p ≤ 0.0001). About 3-fold increase (p ≤ 0.05) of Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) producing cells was observed in NAM treated mice. The plasmatic expression levels of 6 cytokines (namely: Interleukin 5 (IL-5), Eotaxin, Interleukin 12 (p40) (IL12(p40)), Interleukin 3 (IL-3), Interleukin 10 (IL-10) and Regulated on Activation Normal T Expressed and Secreted (RANTES) were significantly changed in the blood of NAM treated mice, suggesting a key role of the immune response. The observed inhibitory effect of NAM on SIRT2 enzymatic activity confirmed previous evidence; we show here that SIRT2 expression is significantly increased in melanoma and inversely related to melanoma-patients survival. Finally, we show for the first time that the expression levels of Niacin receptors HCAR2 and HCAR3 is almost abolished in human melanoma samples. CONCLUSION: NAM shows a relevant anti-melanoma activity in vitro and in vivo and is a suitable candidate for further clinical investigations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Niacin has modest but overall favorable effects on plasma lipids by increasing high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and lowering triglycerides. Clinical trials, however, evaluating niacin therapy for prevention of cardiovascular outcomes have returned mixed results. Recent evidence suggests that the HDL proteome may be a better indicator of HDL's cardioprotective function than HDL-C. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of niacin monotherapy on HDL protein composition and function. METHODS: A 20-week investigational study was performed with 11 participants receiving extended-release niacin (target dose = 2 g/day) for 16-weeks followed by a 4-week washout period. HDL was isolated from participants at weeks: 0, 16, and 20. The HDL proteome was analyzed at each time point by mass spectrometry and relative protein quantification was performed by label-free precursor ion intensity measurement. RESULTS: In this cohort, niacin therapy had typical effects on routine clinical lipids (HDL-C + 16%, q < 0.01; LDL-C - 20%, q < 0.01; and triglyceride - 15%, q = 0.1). HDL proteomics revealed significant effects of niacin on 5 proteins: serum amyloid A (SAA), angiotensinogen (AGT), apolipoprotein A-II (APOA2), clusterin (CLUS), and apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1). SAA was the most prominently affected protein, increasing 3-fold in response to niacin (q = 0.008). Cholesterol efflux capacity was not significantly affected by niacin compared to baseline, however, stopping niacin resulted in a 9% increase in efflux (q < 0.05). Niacin did not impact HDL's ability to influence endothelial function. CONCLUSION: Extended-release niacin therapy, in the absence of other lipid-modifying medications, can increase HDL-associated SAA, an acute phase protein associated with HDL dysfunction.",

Naringenin (Nar) and apigenin (Api) are the major active components in aqueous extracts of C. morifolium. The aim of our study was to clarify the roles of Chr, Nar and Api in ameliorating depression-like behaviour induced by corticosterone. First, the behavioural and biochemical indicators closely related to depression were examined to evaluate the therapeutic effects of Chr/Nar/Api on a depression model. Then, a metabolomics approach was utilized to screen for biomarkers and related pathways between a control group and Chr/Nar/Api groups. The comprehensive results revealed that Chr/Nar/Api exerted anti-depressant effects through interfering with tryptophan metabolism, arginine and prolinemetabolism, citrate cycle, niacin and niacinamide metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, and alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism. The mechanism of Chr/Api/Nar in the treatment of depression was elucidated based on material and energy metabolism. Moreover, Nar could be used as a substitute for Chr for reversing depression-like behaviour, and Api was similar to a positive drug in terms of function on depression. The integrated metabolomics approach demonstrated here should be an effective method for interpreting the function of herbs from TCM and clarifying the mechanism of their components in future studies.",

      "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a very common disorder affecting between 20 and 30% of adults in the United States. However, there is no effective pharmacotherapy for treating NAFLD. Niacin, a water-soluble vitamin (B3), at pharmacological doses, decreases hepatic triglyceride (TG) content in NAFLD through inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2, a key enzyme that catalyzes the final step in TG synthesis. Alternatively, some studies indicate that niacin induces fatty liver in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed rats. Therefore, in this study we investigated whether niacin is beneficial in treating NAFLD in two strains of mice, C57BL/6J (B6) and B6129SF2/J (B6129) mice, with 20 weeks of HFD feeding. Niacin treatment was started from week 5 until the end of the study. Niacin treatment increased normalized liver weight, hepatic TG content and NAFLD score in HFD-fed B6129 mice but had no impact on B6 mice. Metabolomics analysis revealed that in B6129 mice, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid (4-HPP), which is associated with fatty acid oxidation, did not change with HFD feeding but significantly decreased with niacin treatment. Lipidomics analysis discovered that the abundance of phosphocholine (PC), which is critical for very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG production and secretion, was decreased in HFD-fed B6129 with niacin treatment. In conclusion, niacin had no impact on diet-induced NAFLD development in B6 mice but potentiated hepatic steatosis in HFD-fed B6129 mice due to impaired fatty acid oxidation and decreased VLDL-TG production and secretion.",

This review of oral over-the-counter supplement use in dermatology summarizes current evidence for the use of zinc, biotin, vitamin D, nicotinamide, and Polypodium in the management of common dermatologic disorders. Evidence for the safety and efficacy of these supplements is limited. Very few large-scale randomized controlled trials exist for these over-the-counter supplements, particularly biotin and Polypodium. The lack of standardized dosing and standardized outcome measures makes comparison across existing studies challenging, and the lack of adverse events reporting in the majority of studies limits analysis of supplement safety. The most promising evidence exists for the use of nicotinamide in preventing nonmelanoma skin cancers. There is some evidence for the role of vitamin D in decreasing melanoma risk and progression in some individuals and for the photoprotective role of Polypodium, although additional high-quality studies are needed to determine appropriate dosing. Current evidence is insufficient to recommend the use of biotin or zinc supplements in dermatology. Large-scale randomized controlled trials investigating safety and efficacy are needed before widespread incorporation of these oral supplements into the general practice of dermatology.",

Notably, NAM is an inhibitor of both SIRT1 and PARP1. Accumulating evidence suggests that NAM plays a role in cancer prevention and therapy. Phase III clinical trials have confirmed its clinical efficacy for non-melanoma skin cancer chemoprevention or as an adjunct to radiotherapy against head and neck, laryngeal, and urinary bladder cancers. Evidence for other cancers has mostly been collected through preclinical research and, in its majority, is not yet evidence-based. NAM has potential as a safe, well-tolerated, and cost-effective agent to be used in cancer chemoprevention and therapy.

      "abstract": "Glioblastomas are generally incurable partly because monocytes, macrophages, and microglia in afflicted patients do not function in an antitumor capacity. Medications that reactivate these macrophages/microglia, as well as circulating monocytes that become macrophages, could thus be useful to treat glioblastoma. We have discovered that niacin (vitamin B3) is a potential stimulator of these inefficient myeloid cells. Niacin-exposed monocytes attenuated the growth of brain tumor-initiating cells (BTICs) derived from glioblastoma patients by producing anti-proliferative interferon-α14. Niacin treatment of mice bearing intracranial BTICs increased macrophage/microglia representation within the tumor, reduced tumor size, and prolonged survival. These therapeutic outcomes were negated in mice depleted of circulating monocytes or harboring interferon-α receptor-deleted BTICs. Combination treatment with temozolomide enhanced niacin-promoted survival. Monocytes from glioblastoma patients had increased interferon-α14 upon niacin exposure and were reactivated to reduce BTIC growth in culture. We highlight niacin, a common vitamin that can be quickly translated into clinical application, as an immune stimulator against glioblastomas.",

      "abstract": "Remyelination following CNS demyelination restores rapid signal propagation and protects axons; however, its efficiency declines with increasing age. Both intrinsic changes in the oligodendrocyte progenitor cell population and extrinsic factors in the lesion microenvironment of older subjects contribute to this decline. Microglia and monocyte-derived macrophages are critical for successful remyelination, releasing growth factors and clearing inhibitory myelin debris. Several studies have implicated delayed recruitment of macrophages/microglia into lesions as a key contributor to the decline in remyelination observed in older subjects. Here we show that the decreased expression of the scavenger receptor CD36 of aging mouse microglia and human microglia in culture underlies their reduced phagocytic activity. Overexpression of CD36 in cultured microglia rescues the deficit in phagocytosis of myelin debris. By screening for clinically approved agents that stimulate macrophages/microglia, we have found that niacin (vitamin B3) upregulates CD36 expression and enhances myelin phagocytosis by microglia in culture. This increase in myelin phagocytosis is mediated through the niacin receptor (hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2). Genetic fate mapping and multiphoton live imaging show that systemic treatment of 9-12-month-old demyelinated mice with therapeutically relevant doses of niacin promotes myelin debris clearance in lesions by both peripherally derived macrophages and microglia. This is accompanied by enhancement of oligodendrocyte progenitor cell numbers and by improved remyelination in the treated mice. Niacin represents a safe and translationally amenable regenerative therapy for chronic demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This is a review of the research on the effectiveness of vitamin supplementation for alcoholism and alcohol-related illnesses. The focus is on research, both clinical and basic on alcohol treatment and nutritional effectiveness of these vital nutrients. RECENT FINDINGS: Most of the research involves basic experiments exploring the impact of vitamin depletion or deficits on physiological systems, especially liver and brain, in rodents. These often include behavioral measures that use cognitive, learning/memory and motivation experiments that model clinical studies. These provide support for hypotheses concerning the impact of such deficiencies in clinical populations. Clinical studies are rare and involve evaluation of the outcome of supplementation usually in the context of a treatment program. Specific vitamins, dosages and treatment programs vary. Deficiencies in retinoids (vitamin A), thiamine (B1) and niacin (B3) are the most frequently investigated. However, there is a greater need for further research on other vitamins, and for more uniform supplementation and treatment procedures. SUMMARY: The literature is primarily basic research on specific vitamins. There are very significant findings with individual vitamin supplementation and combinations that show promise of our understanding of the role of vitamins in the disease of alcoholism and its treatment.",

However, the level of HBsAg could not be reduced by interferons and nucleoside analogs effectively. Therefore, identification of a new drug targeting HBsAg is urgently needed. METHODS: In this study, 6-AN was screened out from 1500 compounds due to its low cytotoxicity and high antiviral activity. The effect of 6-AN on HBV was examined in HepAD38, HepG2-NTCP and PHHs cells. In addition, the antivirus effect of 6-AN was also identified in mouse model. FINDINGS: 6-AN treatment resulted in a significant decrease of HBsAg and other viral markers both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that 6-AN inhibited the activities of HBV SpI, SpII and core promoter by decreasing transcription factor PPARα, subsequently reduced HBV RNAs transcription and HBsAg production. INTERPRETATION: We have identified a novel small molecule to inhibit HBV core DNA, HBV RNAs, HBsAg production, as well as cccDNA to a minor degree both in vitro and in vivo. This study may shed light on the development of a novel class of anti-HBV agent.",

      "abstract": "Novel antimicrobials for treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are needed. We hypothesized that nicotinamide (NAM) and nicotinic acid (NA) modulate macrophage function to restrict M. tuberculosis replication in addition to their direct antimicrobial properties. Both compounds had modest activity in 7H9 broth, but only NAM inhibited replication in macrophages. Surprisingly, in macrophages NAM and the related compound pyrazinamide restricted growth of bacille Calmette-Guérin but not wild-type Mycobacterium bovis, which both lack a functional nicotinamidase/pyrazinamidase (PncA) rendering each strain resistant to these drugs in broth culture. Interestingly, NAM was not active in macrophages infected with a virulent M. tuberculosis mutant encoding a deletion in pncA. We conclude that the differential activity of NAM and nicotinic acid on infected macrophages suggests host-specific NAM targets rather than PncA-dependent direct antimicrobial properties. These activities are sufficient to restrict attenuated BCG, but not virulent wild-type M. bovis or M. tuberculosis.",

Anti-inflammatory actions of niacin and a possible role of its receptor GPR109A have been studied previously. However, the precise molecular mechanism of niacin's action in reducing inflammation through GPR109A is unknown. Here we observed that niacin reduced the translocation of phosphorylated nuclear kappa B (p-NF-κB) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the nucleus of RAW264.7 cells. The reduction in the nuclear translocation in turn decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 in RAW264.7 cells. We observed a decrease in the nuclear translocation of p-NF-κB and the expression of inflammatory cytokines after knockdown of GPR109A in RAW264.7 cells. Our results suggest that these molecular actions of niacin are mediated via its receptor GPR109A (also known as HCAR2) by controlling the translocation of p-NF-κB to the nucleus. Overall, our findings suggest that niacin treatment may have potential in reducing inflammation by targeting GPR109A.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cisplatin (CisPt) has a well-recognized anticancer activity by interacting with DNA and inducing programmed cell death. However, theoretical studies performed on the molecular level suggest that such nonspecific interactions can also take place with many competitive compounds, such as vitamins containing aromatic rings with lone-pair orbitals. OBJECTIVE: This work is a theoretical study on the initial Pt-N7(N1) bond formation with vitamins from B group and their comparison with values characterizing native purines. METHODS: Geometries of studied structures were optimized with an aid of Gaussian 09 using the B3LYP functional with the 6-31G** basis set. Atomic orbitals of platinum were represented by the lanl2dz basis. Solvation free energies were evaluated by a self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) approach. A dielectric constant of 78 for water was used in the PCM continuum model computations along with radii Bondii. RESULTS: The affinities of mono-aqua cis~[Pt(NH3)2Cl(H2O)]+ and di-aqua cis~ [Pt(NH3)2(H2O)2]2+ derivatives of Cisplatinum toward compounds belonging to the group of eight B vitamins were studied and compared to interactions with canonical purines. All the values of ΔGr unambiguously indicate that reactions with cisPt-diaqua are more preferable, but the comparison of ΔGr values obtained for compounds from vitamin B group and the ones characterizing complexes created by Guanine molecules indicates higher affinity of cisPt monomers toward purines. CONCLUSION: Based on the observations, the regular intake of vitamin-rich beetroot or carrot juices is strongly discouraged during anticancer therapy using CisPt drug. To confirm the results of the performed computational study, detailed clinical trials should be performed.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The major adverse effect associated with systemic administration of Fluconazole (FLZ), is hepatic toxicity. FLZ is most commonly used antifungal drug in treatment of invasive fungal infections. METHODS: FLZ toxicity was challenged by individual and in combination of three vitamins (B1, B2 B3). Animals were divided nine groups with six animals in each group. FLZ, at a dose of 50 mg/kg b.w, was orally administered for 90 days in experimental animals. Vitamins as individual or in combination was administered concomitantly to challenge or alleviate the toxicity of FLZ. They were sacrificed at the end of protocol for biochemical and histopathology analysis. Focus was made to observe the role of these micro nutrient's (vitamins) on liver for alteration in of pathological and physiological effects by FLZ in the Wistar albino rats. RESULTS: Combination of vitamin B1 + B2 + B3 in FLZ induced toxicity was able to restore the level of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) near to normal but with high level of ALP in B1 Control group. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was restored to normal in FLZ + B1, FLZ + B2 and FLZ + B1 + B2 + B3 groups and vice versa in FLZ + B3 group animals. Further the level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was restored to normal in FLZ + B3 animals. There were no significant changes found in total bilirubin (TBI), and direct bilirubin (DBI) as compare to normal control. Histopathological studies on animals' studies validated the serological results in normalizing the cellular architecture of liver. CONCLUSIONS: Restoration of altered biochemical parameters and cellular architecture of hepatocytes by different combination of these vitamins proves the chemo preventive potential of these micro nutrients' in FLZ toxicity.

The process was carried out using an ultrasound assisted convective dryer and analyzed in terms of drying time, energy consumption (EC), evaporation rate (ER), broken kernel (BK), water activity (aw), vitamin B3 (niacin), and total phenolic content (TPC). The lab-scale dryer was set to transmit energy at power levels of 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 W in the air temperatures of 35, 40, 45, 50, and 55 °C and velocities of 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.1, and 1.4 m/s for a thickness of 20 cm. The results showed that in-range drying parameters played a major role in response analysis, suggesting that ultrasound efficiency during convective drying heavily depends on the power, air temperature, and velocity levels. Ultrasound assistance significantly increased bed evaporation rate up to 38.93%. Subsequently, it caused a reasonable reduction in total drying time, EC, and BK percentage up to 27.92%, 25.98%, and 34.22%, respectively in the case of 35 °C, v = 0.8 m/s, and P = 90 W. Remarkable advances were attained in the ultrasound assisted drying domain in grain quality via acceptable decrease in niacin and TPC losses within shorter drying time. There was a significant linear trend in BK, niacin, and TPC values across the bed thickness, which all was increased by the ultrasound application. The highest nutrient retention and physical quality preservation belonged to the top layer, which was influenced by the ultrasound radiation by the highest degree."

Reactive oxygen species generated through lung ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury during surgery plays a crucial role. Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, has been demonstrated to possess antioxidative and anti-inflammatory capacity. In this study, we examine the pulmonary barrier function via capillary filtration coefficient (Kfc) following lung I/R injury with and without niacin treatment. METHODS: Studies were conducted on male Sprague-Dawley rats in 3 groups: sham-operated, lung I/R injury, and niacin-pretreated lung I/R injury group. Rats were subjected to isolated perfused lung preparation. Lung ischemia was established by continuous perfusion and stopping ventilation for 60 minutes, followed by 60 minutes of ventilation. We assessed the Kfc, lung water content, and protein concentration in the lung lavage; pulmonary oxidative stress and lung inflammation were assessed by leukocyte counts, tissue level of tumor nercrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and tissue content of malondialdehyde (MDA), respectively. We also assessed the tissue protein level of sirtuin (silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog) 1 (SIRT1). RESULTS: Lungs subjected to I/R injury significantly increased Kfc, pulmonary oxidative stress, lung water content, and lavage leukocyte count and protein concentration (P < .05). Rats treated with niacin of 100 mg/kg/day for 4 days increased lung SIRT1 (P < .05) and attenuated lung I/R injury-induced pulmonary oxidative stress and inflammation and also improved Kfc. CONCLUSIONS: Niacin pretreatment protects lungs against I/R injury-induced barrier function impairment through the activation of SIRT1 and reduced pulmonary oxidative stress and lung inflammation.",

      "abstract": "Evidences in the form of experimental analysis and scientific investigations suggest that oxidative stress embody an imperative role in the onset and progression of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Aberrant elevation in levels of free radicals, as observed upon disease onset, and the subsequent reduction in anti-oxidant defenses is pernicious to metabolic enzymes and cellular organelles. Niacin (Vitamin B3) is an essential nutrient for humans and is considered to be an important food additive for animals too. This research was conducted to examine the effect of nutraceutical antioxidant on diabetic environment. This important member of Vitamin B complex is a forerunner of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and also nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), both of them serving as coenzymes for several metabolic enzymes. This study reports the effects of niacin supplementation in alloxan induced diabetic rats divided into five groups. Diabetes induced rats were further treated with niacin at two doses (10 and 15 mg /kg body weight) and compared with a control set of diabetes without treatment. Niacin treatment showed recovery in almost all parameters in a dose reliant pattern. A notable decline in oxidative stress parameters with reductions in fasting blood glucose levels was observed. Histological studies reveal damage recovery in the liver as well as kidney tissues. A notable amount of recovery was observed in cellular DNA damage. As a deduction, it is advocated that dietary niacin supplementation might help in reducing problems associated with diabetes. A probable mechanism pertaining to the action of niacin is proposed as well.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In many developing areas in the world, a high burden of enteric pathogens in early childhood are associated with growth deficits. The tryptophan-kynurenine-niacin pathway has been linked to enteric inflammatory responses to intestinal infections. However, it is not known in these settings whether scheduled antimicrobial intervention to reduce subclinical enteric pathogen carriage or repletion of the tryptophan-kynurenine-niacin pathway improves linear growth and development. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We are conducting a randomised, placebo-controlled, factorial intervention trial in the rural setting of Haydom, Tanzania. We are recruiting 1188 children within the first 14 days of life, who will be randomised in a 2×2 factorial design to administration of antimicrobials (azithromycin and nitazoxanide, randomised together) and nicotinamide. The nicotinamide is administered as a daily oral dose, which for breast-feeding children aged 0-6 months is given to the mother and for children aged 6-18 months is given to the child directly. Azithromycin is given to the child as a single oral dose at months 6, 9, 12 and 15; nitazoxanide is given as a 3-day course at months 12 and 15. Mother/child pairs are followed via monthly in-home visits. The primary outcome is the child's length-for-age Z-score at 18 months. Secondary outcomes for the child include additional anthropometry measures; stool pathogen burden and bacterial microbiome; systemic and enteric inflammation; blood metabolomics, growth factors, inflammation and nutrition; hydrogen breath assessment to estimate small-intestinal bacterial overgrowth and assessment of cognitive development. Secondary outcomes for the mother include breastmilk content of nicotinamide, other vitamins and amino acids; blood measures of tryptophan-kynurenine-niacin pathway and stool pathogens. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial has been approved by the Tanzanian National Institute for Medical Research, the Tanzanian FDA and the University of Virginia IRB. Findings will be presented at national and international conferences and published in peer-review journals. PROTOCOL VERSION: 5.0, 4 December 2017.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are characterized by a very high turnover rate, and are thus considered to be relatively free from the age-related insults generated by mitochondria. However, HSCs are also subject to these age-related insults, including the incidence of myeloid proliferative diseases, marrow failure, hematopoietic neoplasms, and deterioration of the adaptive human immune system. Recently, NAD⁺ dietary supplements, known as niacin or vitamin B₃, including tryptophan, nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, and the newly identified NAD⁺ precursor nicotinamide riboside, have been shown to play a role in restoring adult stem cell function through the amelioration of mitochondrial dysfunction. This insight motivated a study that focused on reversing aging-related cellular dysfunction in adult mouse muscle stem cells by supplementing their diet with nicotinamide riboside. The remedial effect of nicotinamide riboside enhanced mitochondrial function in these muscle stem cells in a SIRT1-dependent manner, affecting cellular respiration, membrane potential, and production of ATP. Accordingly, numerous studies have demonstrated that sirtuins, under nuclear/mitochondrial control, have age-specific effects in determining HSC phenotypes. Based on the evidence accumulated thus far, we propose a clinical intervention for the restoration of aged HSC function by improving mitochondrial function through NAD⁺ precursor supplementation.",

The intention of our study was to monitor the urinary excretion of niacin metabolites after coffee consumption under controlled diet. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a 4-day human intervention study on the excretion of major niacin metabolites in the urine of volunteers after ingestion of 500 mL regular coffee containing 34.8 μmol nicotinic acid (NA) and 0.58 μmol nicotinamide (NAM). In addition to NA and NAM, the metabolites N1 -methylnicotinamide (NMNAM), N1 -methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2-Py), and nicotinuric acid (NUA) were identified and quantified in the collected urine samples by stable isotope dilution analysis (SIVA) using HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Rapid urinary excretion was observed for the main metabolites (NA, NAM, NMNAM, and 2-Py), with tmax values within the first hour after ingestion. NUA appeared in traces even more rapidly. In sum, 972 nmol h-1 of NA, NAM, NMNAM, and 2-Py were excreted within 12 h after coffee consumption, corresponding to 6% of the ingested NA and NAM. CONCLUSION: The results indicate regular coffee consumption to be a source of niacin in human diet.",

      "abstract": "The intestine is involved in whole-body lipid and cholesterol homeostasis and secretes lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein (Apo)B48 and discrete ApoA-I into the mesenteric lymph. The lymphatic system has been proposed to have a significant role in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway associated with HDL-ApoA-I. In conditions of insulin resistance (IR), there is intestinal overproduction of chylomicrons containing ApoB48; however, there is limited data on the intestinal synthesis and secretion of HDL-ApoA-I. microRNA (miR)-223 has been shown to regulate peripheral HDL metabolism and may impact intestinal-derived HDL. Niacin (nicotinic acid; vitamin B3) is known to regulate lipid metabolism, but the role of niacin in modulating intestinal lipid and lipoprotein (ApoB48 and ApoA-I) metabolism is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the secretion of intestinal lymphatic HDL-ApoA-I and the effect of dietary intervention with niacin on these pathways in a rodent model of IR. HDL was isolated from intestinal mesenteric lymph by density ultracentrifugation, and subsequent HDL miR analysis was developed in collaboration with Exiqon Services. Insulin-resistant rodents were fed chow or chow with niacin (1% w/w) for 6 wk. Intestinal lymph HDL-ApoA-I and miR-223 expression were lower by at least 45 and 60%, respectively, and lymph HDL was associated with 85% higher triglyceride (TG) content in IR compared to non-IR control group. Niacin was found to increase secretion of lymph HDL and miR-223 by at least 50-60% and to deplete the TGs associated with HDL compared with the nontreated IR group. Niacin significantly increased peroxisome proliferator-activating nuclear receptor α and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I α mRNA and annulled Tnf-α mRNA expression in intestinal (jejunal) explants. Altered intestinal lymphatic HDL-ApoA-I and miR-223 metabolism in IR and modulation by niacin may provide insight into the intestinal-mediated regulation of the reverse cholesterol transport pathway.-Mangat, R., Borthwick, F., Haase, T., Jacome, M., Nelson, R., Kontush, A., Vine, D.

We utilized nicotinic acid, a family member of the B-vitamin niacin (vitamin B3) that has been used in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis or other lipid-metabolic disorders, to treat human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), and investigated its influence on angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. We found that nicotinic acid could obviously inhibit HUVEC proliferation induced by vascular endothelial growth factor. Both the in vitro and in vivo assays showed that nicotinic acid could significantly inhibit the process of angiogenesis. To further investigate the mechanism underlying the effect of nicotinic acid on angiogenesis, we found that it might function via regulating the cytoskeleton arrangements, especially the rearranging the structures of F-actin and paxillin. In summary, we discovered that nicotinic acid could obviously inhibit the process of angiogenesis by changing the angiogenesis factor expression levels and inducing the cytoskeleton rearrangement of endothelial cells.",

Higher doses of nicotinic acid are associated with adverse effects, especially flushing. A unique tolerable upper intake level (UL) of nicotinic acid has not been defined. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aims to evaluate adverse effects and their incidence after supplementation with different doses of nicotinic acid and nicotinamide, comparing results with current ULs in Europe and the United States. DATA SOURCES: PubMed was searched for articles providing detailed information about nicotinic acid or nicotinamide supplementation and related outcomes. STUDY SELECTION: A total of 2670 citations were selected for screening. Two primary outcomes were considered: occurrence of adverse effects following nicotinic acid or nicotinamide supplementation, and dose at which adverse effects occurred. DATA EXTRACTION: Details on study population, type and duration of treatment, dosage of vitamins, association with lipid-influencing drugs, length of follow-up, and incidence and type of adverse events were extracted. RESULTS: After screening, 47 articles involving 11 741 individuals were included. Meta-analysis was based on estimation of benchmark doses for the probability of adverse effects after supplementation. In individuals with dyslipidemia or cardiovascular disease, nicotinic acid monotherapy seems to be protective against any adverse effects considered, as adverse events occurred at doses above those used with other treatments. In healthy individuals treated with nicotinic acid alone, major adverse effects occurred at doses below 1000 mg/d. CONCLUSIONS: Results may indicate a high degree of conservativeness in the UL of nicotinic acid, fixed at 35 mg/d in United States and 10 mg/d in Europe. Reconsideration of the UL of nicotinic acid for nutritional supplements, possibly differentiating between ULs in healthy and unhealthy individuals, may be warranted.",

We hypothesized that modulation of Nrg1 levels and/or secretase activity may constitute a unifying treatment strategy for CMT neuropathies with focal hypermyelination as it could restore normal levels of myelination. Here we show that in vivo delivery of Niaspan, a FDA-approved drug known to enhance TACE activity, efficiently rescues myelination in the Mtmr2-/- mouse, a model of CMT4B1 with myelin outfoldings, and in the Pmp22+/- mouse, which reproduces HNPP (hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies) with tomacula. Importantly, we also found that Niaspan reduces hypermyelination of Vim (vimentin)-/- mice, characterized by increased Nrg1 type III and Akt activation, thus corroborating the hypothesis that Niaspan treatment downregulates Nrg1 type III signaling.",

However, the mechanisms by which either niacin or the byproducts of its catabolism ameliorate these inflammatory diseases are not clear yet. Human circulating monocytes and mature macrophages were used to analyze the effects of niacin and its metabolites (NAM, NUA and 2-Pyr) on oxidative stress, plasticity and inflammatory response by using biochemical, flow cytometry, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot technologies. Niacin, NAM and 2-Pyr significantly decreased ROS, NO and NOS2 expression in LPS-treated human mature macrophages. Niacin and NAM skewed macrophage polarization toward antiinflammatory M2 macrophage whereas a trend toward proinflammatory M1 macrophage was noted following treatment with NUA. Niacin and NAM also reduced the inflammatory competence of LPS-treated human mature macrophages and promoted bias toward antiinflammatory CD14+CD16++ nonclassical human primary monocytes. This study reveals for the first time that niacin and its metabolites possess antioxidant, reprogramming and antiinflammatory properties on human primary monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages. Our findings imply a new understanding of the mechanisms by which niacin and its metabolites favor a continuous and gradual plasticity process in the human monocyte/macrophage system.",

      "abstract": "We survey the historical development of scientific knowledge surrounding Vitamin B3, and describe the active metabolite forms of Vitamin B3, the pyridine dinucleotides NAD+ and NADP+ which are essential to cellular processes of energy metabolism, cell protection and biosynthesis. The study of NAD+ has become reinvigorated by new understandings that dynamics within NAD+ metabolism trigger major signaling processes coupled to effectors (sirtuins, PARPs, and CD38) that reprogram cellular metabolism using NAD+ as an effector substrate. Cellular adaptations include stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, a process fundamental to adjusting cellular and tissue physiology to reduced nutrient availability and/or increased energy demand. Several mammalian metabolic pathways converge to NAD+, including tryptophan-derived de novo pathways, nicotinamide salvage pathways, nicotinic acid salvage and nucleoside salvage pathways incorporating nicotinamide riboside and nicotinic acid riboside. Key discoveries highlight a therapeutic potential for targeting NAD+ biosynthetic pathways for treatment of human diseases. A recent emergence of understanding that NAD+ homeostasis is vulnerable to aging and disease processes has stimulated testing to determine if replenishment or augmentation of cellular or tissue NAD+ can have ameliorative effects on aging or disease phenotypes. This experimental approach has provided several proofs of concept successes demonstrating that replenishment or augmentation of NAD+ concentrations can provide ameliorative or curative benefits. Thus NAD+ metabolic pathways can provide key biomarkers and parameters for assessing and modulating organism health.",

Various approaches including chemical and biological controls have been attempted to arrest the tomato diseases so far. In this study, in vitro growths of bacterial R. solanacearum and fungal B. cinerea were evaluated using four different vitamins including thiamine (vitamin B1), niacin (vitamin B3), pyridoxine (vitamin B6), and menadione (vitamin K3). In planta efficacies of the four vitamin treatments on tomato protection against both diseases were also demonstrated. All four vitamins showed different in vitro antibacterial activities against R. solanacearum in dose-dependent manners. However, treatment with 2 mM thiamine was only effective in reducing bacterial wilt of detached tomato leaves without phytotoxicity under lower disease pressure (106 colony-forming unit [cfu]/ml). Treatment with the vitamins also differentially reduced in vitro conidial germination and mycelial growth of B. cinerea. The four vitamins slightly reduced the conidial germination, and thiamine, pyridoxine and menadione inhibited the mycelial growth of B. cinerea. Menadione began to drastically suppress the conidial germination and mycelial growth by 5 and 0.5 mM, respectively. Grey mould symptoms on the inoculated tomato leaves were significantly reduced by pyridoxine and menadione pretreatments one day prior to the fungal challenge inoculation. These findings suggest that disease-specific vitamin treatment will be integrated for eco-friendly management of tomato bacterial wilt and grey mould."

It was observed that UV treatment of apple juice at disinfection doses caused minor reductions (p < 0.05) in the concentrations of two main polyphenols (i.e., chlorogenic acid and epicatechin). In contrast, significant (p < 0.05) decreases in vitamin concentrations were observed (p < 0.05). The irradiated juice was evaluated for cytotoxic effects. The irradiated apple juice showed no cytotoxic effects on normal intestinal cells, and both irradiated and nonirradiated samples are significantly comparable in inhibiting the growth of human colon cancer cells. Overall, these results indicated that UV-C treatment of apple juice neither significantly degraded polyphenols nor generated cytotoxic compounds."

      "abstract": "In premenopausal women, endogenous estrogens are associated with reduced prevalence of arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Clinical trials conducted in the 1990s such as HERS, WHI, and WISDOM have shown that postmenopausal treatment with horse hormone mixtures (so-called conjugated equine estrogens) and synthetic progestins adversely affects female cardiovascular health. Our understanding of rapid (nongenomic) and chronic (genomic) estrogen signaling has since advanced considerably, including identification of a new G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), which like the \"classical\" receptors ERα and ERβ is highly abundant in the cardiovascular system. Here, we discuss the role of estrogen receptors in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease and review natural and synthetic ligands of estrogen receptors as well as their effects in physiology, on cardiovascular risk factors, and atherosclerotic vascular disease. Data from preclinical and clinical studies using nonselective compounds activating GPER, which include selective estrogen receptor modulators such as tamoxifen or raloxifene, selective estrogen receptor downregulators such as Faslodex™ (fulvestrant/ICI 182,780), vitamin B3 (niacin), green tea catechins, and soy flavonoids such as genistein or resveratrol, strongly suggest that activation of GPER may afford therapeutic benefit for primary and secondary prevention in patients with or at risk for coronary artery disease. Evidence from preclinical studies suggest similar efficacy profiles for selective small molecule GPER agonists such as G-1 which are devoid of uterotrophic activity. Further clinical research in this area is warranted to provide opportunities for future cardiovascular drug development.",

They appear no matter on the age, gender, and often as a congenital defect. Disorder connected with overproduction of melanin by pigmentary cells. The change of color is due to endogenous and exogenous cause. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this thesis was to conduct a research in vivo. This will allow to judge the effectiveness of the cosmetic product which brightens the skin with hyperpigmentation problems. The characteristics of dermocosmetics were tested on people with various etiology of hyperpigmentation. The aim of the research was to assess the effect of the active substances used daily on skin hyperpigmentation. METHODS: The tests were carried out on groups of patients with hyperpigmentations. The application of the pharmaceutical and the use of specific apparatus measurements were taken on every medical checkup. A survey was conducted to assess the changes in the face, neck, and neckline skin. The research was based on the apparatus analysis of the skin condition (MPA® , VISIA® ). RESULTS: Regular application of the pharmaceutical caused brightening of hyperpigmentations (P < 0.05). General improvement in skin condition was also observed - the increase in skin elasticity, smoothness, and the enhancement of hydration levels. CONCLUSIONS: Dermocosmetics for people with hyperpigmentation are an essential part of their medical treatment. In case of epidermal hyperpigmentation, the recipe of individually chosen and tested combination of ingredients enables us to reach satisfactory results.",

      "abstract": "1-Methylnicotinamide (MNA), the major endogenous metabolite of nicotinic acid (NicA), may partially contribute to the vasoprotective properties of NicA. Here we compared the antiatherosclerotic effects of MNA and NicA in apolipoprotein E (ApoE)/low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-deficient mice. ApoE/LDLR(-/-) mice were treated with MNA or NicA (100 mg/kg). Plaque size, macrophages, and cholesterol content in the brachiocephalic artery, endothelial function in the aorta, systemic inflammation, platelet activation, as well as the concentration of MNA and its metabolites in plasma and urine were measured. MNA and NicA reduced atherosclerotic plaque area, plaque inflammation, and cholesterol content in the brachiocephalic artery. The antiatherosclerotic actions of MNA and NicA were associated with improved endothelial function, as evidenced by a higher concentration of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 α and nitrite/nitrate in the aortic ring effluent, inhibition of platelets (blunted thromboxane B2 generation), and inhibition of systemic inflammation (lower plasma concentration of serum amyloid P, haptoglobin). NicA treatment resulted in an approximately 2-fold higher concentration of MNA and its metabolites in urine and a 4-fold higher nicotinamide/MNA ratio in plasma, compared with MNA treatment. In summary; MNA displays pronounced antiatherosclerotic action in ApoE/LDLR(-/-) mice, an effect associated with an improvement in prostacyclin- and nitric oxide-dependent endothelial function, inhibition of platelet activation, inhibition of inflammatory burden in plaques, and diminished systemic inflammation. Despite substantially higher MNA availability after NicA treatment, compared with an equivalent dose of MNA, the antiatherosclerotic effect of NicA was not stronger. We suggest that detrimental effects of NicA or its metabolites other than MNA may limit beneficial effects of NicA-derived MNA.",

      "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an increasing problem worldwide. The number of end-stage renal disease patients requiring treatment by dialysis is estimated to be increasing by 10,000 patients per year in Japan. Furthermore, an estimated 13 million people are living with CKD in Japan. Various complications are associated with CKD, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). More than one-third of CKD patients die from CVD. Thus, prevention of CVD is a primary concern for the treatment of CKD patients. CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a serious complication that typically leads to CVD. Hyperphosphatemia is thought to be a central-risk factor for CKD-MBD. Therefore, managing hyperphosphatemia is crucial to prevent CKD-MBD and CVD. It is difficult to achieve the target serum phosphate level through dietary modifications alone in patients with hyperphosphatemia, because most foods contain phosphate. Thus, phosphate binders such as calcium carbonate are commonly prescribed to CKD patients with hyperphosphatemia, but these have undesirable side effects. Inhibition of intestinal phosphate transport activity has also been investigated as an alternative approach for controlling serum phosphate levels in CKD patients. Nicotinamide, which is the amide of niacin, can inhibit intestinal phosphate transport. Niacin and related compounds have also been developed as drugs for hyperlipidemia conditions, especially hypertriglyceridemia with low high-density lipoprotein. This type of dyslipidemia is frequently observed in CKD patients and is a modifiable risk factor for CVD. Thus, niacin and related compounds may have utility for the treatment of both hyperphosphatemia and dyslipidemia in CKD patients to prevent CVD.",

Here, we show that niacin plays an important role in the regulation of autophagic flux and protects tumor cells against TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Our results indicated that niacin activated autophagic flux in human colon cancer cells and the autophagic flux activation protected tumor cells from TRAIL-induced dysfunction of mitochondrial membrane potential and tumor cell death. We also demonstrated that ATG5 siRNA and autophagy inhibitor blocked the niacin-mediated inhibition of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our study is the first report demonstrating that niacin inhibits TRAIL-induced apoptosis through activation of autophagic flux in human colon cancer cells. And our results also suggest that autophagy inhibitors including genetic and pharmacological tools may be a successful therapeutics during anticancer therapy using TRAIL.",

The recommended dietary allowance of niacin as vitamin B3 is 14 to 16 mg daily in adults, while the doses of niacin used in the treatment of hyperlipidemia are generally in the range of 1 to 3 g. Administration of such large doses requires a high concentration of the active compound in the tablet and proper control of the drug release. In this study, a hydrogel matrix based on poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) and polyvinylpyrrolidone was investigated as delivery vehicle for controlled NA release into the gastrointestinal environment. The prepared hydrogel matrices varied in used monomer and crosslinker types and concentrations. The content of NA in tablets was between 65-80 %. The release profiles of NA from tablets were examined under three different pH values (1, 4.5 and 6.8) over the time period of 30 h. The effects of the monomer ratio, the crosslinking of the polymer network, and the solubility of niacin during drug release under various pH are discussed. The results showed that the release time period can be achieved in a relatively wide range of time and can be adjusted according to the medical requirements.",

      "abstract": "Niacin is an important vitamin (B3) that can be used in gram doses to positively modify pathogenetically relevant lipid disorders: elevated LDL cholesterol, elevated non-HDL cholesterol, elevated triglycerides, elevated lipoprotein(a), and reduced HDL cholesterol. This review reports the latest published findings with respect to niacin's mechanisms of action on these lipids and its anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic effects. In the pre-statin era, niacin was shown to have beneficial effects on cardiovascular end-points; but in recent years, two major studies performed in patients whose LDL cholesterol levels had been optimized by a statin therapy did not demonstrate an additional significant effect on these end-points in the groups where niacin was administered. Both studies have several drawbacks that suggest that they are not representative for other patients. Thus, niacin still plays a role either as an additive to a statin or as a substitute for a statin in statin-intolerant patients. Moreover, patients with elevated triglyceride and low HDL cholesterol levels and patients with elevated lipoprotein(a) concentrations will possibly benefit from niacin, although currently the study evidence for these indications is rather poor. Niacin may be useful for compliant patients, however possible side effects (flushing, liver damage) and contraindications should be taken into consideration.",

      "abstract": "Vitamin B3 (niacin) deficiency can cause pellagra with symptoms of dermatitis, diarrhea and dementia. However, it is unclear whether the vitamin B3 deficiency causes human aging. FK866 (a Nampt inhibitor) can reduce intracellular NAD(+) level and induce senescence of human Hs68 cells. However, the mechanisms underlying FK866-induced senescence of Hs68 cells are unclear. In this study, we used FK866 to mimic the effects of vitamin B3 deficiency to reduce the NAD(+) level and investigated the mechanisms of FK866-induced senescence of Hs68 cells. We hypothesized that FK866 induced the senescence of Hs68 cells via an attenuation of NAD(+)-silent information regulator T1 (SIRT1) signaling. We found that FK866 induced cell senescence and diminished cellular NAD(+) levels and SIRT1 activity (detected by acetylation of p53), and these effects were dramatically antagonized by co-treatment with nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, or NAD(+). In contrast, the protein expression of SIRT1, AMP-activated protein kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin, and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) was not affected by FK866. In addition, the role of GSH in the FK866-induced cells senescence may be limited, as N-acetylcysteine did not antagonize FK866-induced cell senescence. These results suggest that FK866 induces cell senescence via attenuation of NAD(+)-SIRT1 signaling. The effects of vitamin B3 deficiency on human aging warrant further investigation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tryptophan is an essential amino acid for the synthesis of proteins and important metabolites such as serotonin, melatonin, tryptamine and niacin. After protein synthesis, more than 90 % of tryptophan catabolism occurs along the kynurenine pathway. The inflammation-inducible enzyme indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) is responsible for the first rate-limiting step in the kynurenine pathway, i.e., oxidation of tryptophan to kynurenine. Excessive IDO activity in conditions such as HIV/AIDS may lead to tryptophan depletion and accumulation of metabolites downstream from kynurenine. Little is known about the kynurenine pathway of HIV/AIDS patients in sub-Saharan regions. This study, in a low income sub-Saharan HIV/AIDS population, examined the effects of activities in the kynurenine pathway on plasma levels of tryptophan, kynurenine and the neurotoxin quinolinic acid, and on de novo synthesis of nicotinamide. METHODS: Plasma samples were obtained from a cohort of 105 HIV patients and 60 controls. Kynurenine pathway metabolites were analysed using gas chromatography - mass spectrometry. ELISA and flow cytometry were used to assess plasma inflammatory markers. RESULTS: IDO activity, depletion of tryptophan, as well as accumulation of kynurenine and the neurotoxin quinolinic acid, were not only significantly greater in the patients than in the controls, but also markedly greater than in HIV/AIDS patients from developed countries. Tryptophan levels were 12.3 % higher, kynurenine levels 16.2 % lower, quinolinic acid levels 43.2 % lower and nicotinamide levels 27,2 % lower in patients on antiretroviral treatment than in antiretroviral-naïve patients. Patients' kynurenine pathway metabolites correlated with the levels of inflammatory markers, including that of the major IDO-inducer, interferon-gamma. Indications are that the rate of de novo synthesis of nicotinamide in the kynurenine pathway correlates with increases in quinolinic acid levels up to a point where saturation of the enzyme quinolinate phosphoribosyl transferase occurs. CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of inflammatory activity in this low income sub-Saharan HIV/AIDS population than in patients from developed countries lead to greater tryptophan depletion and greater accumulation of metabolites downstream from tryptophan with quinolinic acid levels often reaching levels associated with the development of HIV/AIDS-associated neurocognitive dysfunction. De novo synthesis of nicotinamide from quinolinic acid contributes to the maintenance of nicotinamide, and by implication NAD levels, in HIV/AIDS patients from low income populations. Antiretroviral treatment partially corrects disturbances in the kynurenine pathway.",

We found the expression levels of BTB factors (Connexin43, ZO-1, Vimentin, Claudin1, Claudin5) were disrupted in TM-4 cells after HS treatment, which were recovered by the addition of carnitine. RT-PCR indicated that the mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6) were increased after HS treatment, and their related miRNAs (miR-132, miR-431, miR-543) levels were decreased. Our metabolomic data provided a novel understanding of metabolic changes in male reproductive cells after HS treatment and revealed that HS-induced changes of BTB factors and inflammatory status might be caused by the decreased carnitine after HS treatment.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The use of B-vitamin supplements has increased over the last decade. Although use is widespread in both military and civilian populations, data on patterns of B-vitamin prescription rates are lacking. OBJECTIVE: This study examines trends in B-vitamin prescriptions dispensed by military treatment facilities. METHODS: We examined data from the Department of Defense Pharmacy Data Transaction Service to determine the nature of several B-vitamin prescriptions dispensed through military treatment facilities from 2007 through 2011. The eight B vitamins examined were B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), B5 (panthenol), B6 (pyridoxine), B7 (biotin), B9 (folic acid), and B12 (cobalamin). RESULTS: The number of B-vitamin prescriptions dispensed from military treatment facilities decreased 7% from 278,972 in 2007 to 260,472 in 2011. Individual vitamin prescription patterns varied widely. Vitamins B6, B9, and B12 were the most frequently prescribed in each year. Vitamin B2 prescriptions quadrupled between 2009 and 2011, and B12 prescriptions showed a steady increase over time. In contrast, vitamins B3, B6, and B9 prescriptions showed a steady decline, and vitamin B7 prescriptions decreased by 66% between 2008 and 2009. CONCLUSIONS: No single pattern in B-vitamin prescriptions was observed. The driving forces behind increases in prescribed and non-prescribed dietary supplement use remain speculative.",

Niacin is a precursor for NAD-NADH which is needed for dopamine production. Thus, niacin supplementation may serve three purposes: reduce inflammation through GPR109A-related mechanisms, increase dopamine synthesis in the striatum through NADPH supply and increase NAD/NADH ratio to boost mitochondrial functions. GPR109A and its agonists are known to exert anti-inflammatory actions in the skin, gut and retina. However these roles are neither anticipated nor established in the CNS. For the first time here we propose the roles of GPR109A and its agonists including niacin in CNS pathology. Moreover we predict that the neuroprotective roles of either niacin or butyrates in CNS occur via GPR109A.",
