      "abstract": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder that significantly impacts learning, daily functioning, and personal development. Astaxanthin (ASTA), a naturally occurring antioxidant, has garnered interest as a potential therapeutic agent for various diseases, particularly in mitigating oxidative stress. This study explores a novel application of ASTA in the context of ADHD, aiming to investigate its therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), widely used ADHD model animals, were treated with ASTA (50/100 mg/kg/day) for three weeks, 5 mg/kg/day atomoxetine (ATO) as the positive, and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats as control. Behavioral improvements were assessed using the open field test (OFT) and the Morris water maze (MWM). Biochemical analyses were conducted to evaluate changes in the levels of various neurotrophic factors, while histological examinations were performed to assess neuroprotective effects. Additionally, the role of ASTA in the brain-gut axis was investigated. The behavioral symptoms of hyperactivity, anxiety, and impaired spatial memory in ADHD animals were mitigated by ASTA. This improvement is primarily attributed to the restoration of neurotransmitter levels, particularly dopamine (DA), achieved through the modulation of several critical components within the dopamine system, including dopamine receptor 1 (DR1), dopamine transporter (DAT), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and synaptic-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25). Additionally, regulating the serotonin transporter (SERT) and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) supports the recovery of serotonin levels and facilitates optimal brain development. Furthermore, cerebellar cells were protected, and the structure of the intestinal microbiota was regulated. ASTA can mitigate ADHD symptoms in SHR through the modulation of the dopaminergic system, multiple neurotransmitters, neurotrophic factors, and the neuro-intestinal environment, which establishes ASTA as a promising nutraceutical candidate for adjunctive therapy in pediatric ADHD.",

      "abstract": "High internal phase Pickering emulsions (HIPPEs) were stabilized by thermally treated quinoa protein isolate (QPI), including atmospheric pressure boiling (AB), high pressure boiling (HPB), and baking (B), respectively, for the encapsulation of curcumin (CUR) and astaxanthin (AST) to retard its degradation during storage and improve their bioaccessibility. The QPI dispersion was sonicated to generate nanoparticles for the production of HIPPEs. Thermal treatments caused the reduction in the particle size and increased water contact angle compared to the control QPI nanoparticles, and further improving the emulsion properties of QPI. The microstructure results further supported the nature of oil-in-water of HIPPEs stabilized by QPI nanoparticles by showing that the nanoparticles formed a tight interfacial film and closely coated the surface of oil droplets. Thermal treatment reduced the droplet size by approximately 11%, 15%, and 3% for HIPPEs stabilized by AB-QPI, HPB-QPI, and B-QPI, respectively, compared to those of control QPI, which effectively improved the emulsion's viscoelasticity and storage stability. Retention rate and bioaccessibility of CUR and AST in HIPPEs were improved compared to the encapsulation by corn oil, showing HPB-QPI > AB-QPI > B-QPI > control QPI. HIPPEs stabilized by thermally treated QPI-protected lipophilic bioactive compounds and were beneficial for the advancement of functional foods based on QPI. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The emulsifying properties of QPI nanoparticles were significantly improved after thermal treatment. High internal phase Pickering emulsion stabilized by thermally treated QPI nanoparticles significantly improved the stability and bioaccessibility of curcumin and astaxanthin. It provides a theoretical basis for utilizing thermally treated QPI nanoparticles as emulsifiers in delivery systems, broadening the development of curcumin and astaxanthin in the food and pharmaceutical fields.",

      "abstract": "Atherosclerosis (AS) is a major and common pathological basis of ischemic intestinal infarction, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and other highly lethal and disabling diseases. Current pharmacological interventions (e.g., statins) often cause adverse effects, limiting their long-term use. Natural compounds, with their multitarget efficacy and superior safety profiles, have emerged as promising alternatives for AS treatment. As a potent antioxidant carotenoid, astaxanthin exhibits unique therapeutic potential by simultaneously targeting inflammation, oxidative stress, and lipid metabolism, which are key drivers of AS pathogenesis. This study will systematically decipher astaxanthin's therapeutic mechanisms through an integrative strategy encompassing artificial intelligence virtual screening and experimental validation. Notably, five proteins, including CTSD, DPP4, FABP5, ITGAL, and MMP9, were identified as core targets for astaxanthin intervention in AS via network pharmacology and machine learning. Meanwhile, the results from molecular dynamic simulations confirmed that these core targets can stable binding with astaxanthin. Furthermore, in vitro experiments further validated astaxanthin can inhibit foam cell formation, restore redox balance, and suppress inflammation. Moreover, a close correlation has been found between them. These findings position astaxanthin as a multitarget natural agent to combat AS, addressing both efficacy advantage and safety concerns of current therapies."

      "abstract": "The incidence of overweight and obesity continues to grow at alarming rates around the world. The search for foods with potential benefits in the prevention/treatment of overweight/obesity and related disorders has great relevance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of astaxanthin (ASTX) from freshwater crustaceans (crabs) upon visceral adiposity, adipose tissue lipid metabolism disorders and dyslipidemia present in a Metabolic Syndrome rodent model. Male Wistar rats were fed for 90 days with 1 of 4 experimental diets: a-Reference group (RD) received a standard commercial rodent diet, b- High-sucrose diet (HSD) group received a HSD, c- RD+ASTX group received a standard commercial rodent diet plus ASTX, d- HSD+ASTX group received a HSD plus ASTX. The rats were given orally either ASTX (10 mg/kg body weight/day in sunflower oil) or only sunflower oil. Compared with HSD-fed rats, HSD+ASTX group had lower body weight gain (19%) and both reduced abdominal circumference (5%) and visceral adiposity index (5%). Energy intake was 24% lower at the middle of the experimental period. Epididymal adipocytes size and triglyceride (TG) content was reduced by 14%. Besides, fatty acid synthase, malic enzyme and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities in epididymal adipose tissue were 43%, 28% and 38% lower respectively. These changes were accompanied by lower TG (25%) and cholesterol (27%) serum levels, atherogenic index (31%) and reduced Systolic (12%) and Diastolic (15%) blood pressure. The results show that ASTX could be a potential strategy to prevent/attenuate the incidence of metabolic risk factors such as overweight/adiposity and dyslipidemia."

METHODS: In this study, the protective effect of different astaxanthin (ASX) dosages (16 and 32/mg/kg/bw) was determined in rats with 5-FU-induced liver damage. RESULTS: 5-FU induced a significant increase in the histopathological lesions severity and immunohistochemical (TNF-α and 8-OHdG) expression scores in the liver (p < 0.001), significantly increased serum liver parameters (AST, ALP, ALT, GGT, and TP) and malondialdehyde (p < 0.001), and, at the same time, significantly decreased antioxidant parameters (SOD, CAT, GST, GSR, Caspase-3, and GPx) (p < 0.001). Histopathological lesions and oxidative stress parameters significantly decreased in parallel while increasing the ASX dosage (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Based on these data, our results suggest that ASX may be considered a promising and valuable agent to mitigate hepatotoxicity and resistance mechanisms during cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "In this study, kidney bean protein isolate (KPI) and basil seed gum (BSG) thermal aggregates were prepared to form cold-set gels (KB) by adding sodium citrate (SC) and glucono-δ-lactone (GDL). The structure and gel properties of the cold-set gels were investigated. Results showed that the gels added with SC had higher water holding capacity and lower gel strength than GDL-induced gels. While the cold-set gels induced by GDL with the addition of SC (KB-GDL/SC) possessed compact gel network with higher viscoelasticity. Compared with KPI cold-set gels, the KB cold-set gels exhibited higher gel strength and greater capacity to capture water due to the filling and cross-linking effect of BSG, and its high hydrophilicity and changes on the KPI molecular structures. Moreover, the KB-GDL/SC presented a lower syneresis rate of 28.2 % than other gels after freeze-thaw treatment. Meanwhile, KB-GDL/SC showed better protection on astaxanthin under ultraviolet light or during heat treatment. All the KB cold-set gels controlled the release of astaxanthin during simulated digestion. Particularly for KB-SC, the loaded astaxanthin had the highest bioaccesssbility (24.5 %) after in vitro digestion. This study may provide unique insights for development of novel cold-set gels and related functional foods."

Eighteen rats were divided into 3 groups as Group 1: control, Group 2: cyclophosphamide and Group 3: cyclophosphamide + astaxanthin. The CP group, received a 200 mg/kg single dose intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of CP on the seventh day of the experiment, while the control group received no treatment. For CP+AST group 25 mg/kg/day AST administered by oral gavage on days 1-7 and on the 7th day 200 mg/kg/day CP was administered by i.p injection. On the 8th day, the rats were sacrificed by exsanguination and the hearts were dissected. Histopathological examinations were performed by Hematoxylin&Eosin (H&E), Masson Trichrome and Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) staining methods; Annexin-V and Anti-NOX2/gp91phox analyzes were performed by flow cytometry. In histological evaluation of the CP Group; disruptions in cardiac histology and increased PAS(+) staining were observed. These findings were reduced in the CP+AST group compared to the CP group. According to flow cytometry measurements, there was an increase in Annexin-V and Anti-NOX2/gp91phox bound cells in the CP group. With the AST pretreatment, in the CP+AST group Annexin-V and Anti-NOX2/gp91phox bound cell level showed decrease. Based on our study's data, CP may alter cardiac histology and have a negative impact on apoptosis and oxidative damage processes. Astaxanthin may ameliorate these effects of CP on the heart. To enhance the assessment of this protective effect, we propose conducting future research utilizing varied dosages, application durations and advanced analytical techniques."

      "abstract": "Effective anti-aging strategies involving dietary restriction and antioxidant supplementation are gaining increasing research attention, while the health effects of their combined intervention are rarely reported. In this study, for the first time, we investigated the anti-aging effects and underlying mechanisms of intermittent fasting (IF), astaxanthin (AX), and their combination in D-galactose-induced aging rats. Our results demonstrated that these three treatments effectively inhibited malondialdehyde levels and improved the activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes in the brain, liver, and serum of aging rats. Simultaneously, the combination of IF and AX had a synergistic effect on the recovery of brain mitochondrial injury as evidenced by permeability transition pore openness, membrane potential, respiratory chain complex enzyme activity, and cortical and hippocampal lesions. Notably, the combination significantly increased the levels of Immunoglobulin M (55.66 ± 3.23%), immunoglobulin G (34.41 ± 2.65%), and IL-2 (23.49 ± 1.78%) compared with the model group. Moreover, AX reduced the accumulation of pro-inflammatory factor IL-6 (23.06 ± 2.02%), while the combination induced more remarkable reduction in the accumulation of IL-1β (35.92 ± 3.06%) in the serum. Considering the serum metabolomics analysis, we hypothesized that IF and AX played a positive role in the regulation of the nervous system, which was associated with the differential metabolites lysope 16:0, N-Acety-L-tyrosine, and L-Alanyl-L-Lysine. This research reveals that the combination therapy provided synergistic anti-aging efficacy by enhancing resistance to oxidative stress, ameliorating mitochondrial dysfunction, and restoring the immune system. These findings might have significant implications for further studies on the exploration of effective anti-aging therapy.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of astaxanthin (AST) supplementation in drinking water on the growth performance, intestinal barrier function, and cecal microbiota of broilers challenged with Salmonella Enteritidis. During the 20-day experiment, two hundred and forty 1-day-old male Arbor Acres birds were randomly assigned into a 2 × 2 factorial design with four groups: a non-challenged control (CON), an S. Enteritidis-challenged group (SA), a group receiving AST treatment (AST), and an S. Enteritidis-challenged group receiving AST treatment (SA+AST). Each treatment comprised six replicate groups, and challenged groups were inoculated with S. Enteritidis from day 2 to day 4. The results indicated that S. Enteritidis infection significantly reduced the average daily feed intake (ADFI) in broilers and adversely affected average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) by day 20. AST supplementation significantly improved FCR. While S. Enteritidis infection did not significantly affect ileal mucosa antioxidation, it significantly decreased villus height and the villus height-to-crypt depth ratio (VCR), and significantly downregulated mRNA expression of ZO-1 and Occludin. However, AST supplementation significantly enhanced antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), increased villus height and VCR in the ileum, and notably upregulated ZO-1 and MUC2 expression levels, particularly mitigating the adverse effects of S. Enteritidis infection on ileal crypt depth. Furthermore, S. Enteritidis infection significantly affected both the α- and β-diversity of cecal microbiota. Infection with S. Enteritidis was associated with changes at the phylum level, including significant increases in Alistipes, unclassified_f__Lachnospiraceae, and bacteria of the Clostridia UCG-014 grouping, alongside notable decreases in Bacteroides, Akkermansia, Blautia, and Butyricicoccus. AST supplementation significantly decreased the abundance of norank_f__Ruminococcaceae and increased the abundance of Lachnoclostridium and unclassified_f__Lachnospiraceae in the challenged group. In conclusion, AST supplementation in drinking water could improve growth performance and intestinal health in broilers challenged with S. Enteritidis."

      "abstract": "Astaxanthin derived from natural sources has excellent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, and it is currently being widely researched as a neuroprotectant. However, astaxanthin possesses low oral bioavailability, and thus, astaxanthin extract from Haematococcus pluvialis was formulated into a nanoemulsion to improve its bioavailability and administered to Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like rats to study its possible neuroprotective benefits. Astaxanthin nanoemulsion was administered orally once a day for 28 days to streptozotocin (STZ)-induced AD rats at concentrations of 160, 320, and 640 mg/kg of body weight (bw) and subsequently assessed for cognitive function using behavioral assessments. Brain samples were collected for the assessment of AD biomarkers. Astaxanthin nanoemulsion at a dosage of 640 mg/kg bw significantly improved spatial learning, spatial memory, and recognition memory against STZ-AD rats. At 320 and 640 mg/kg bw, astaxanthin nanoemulsion significantly reduced levels of hippocampus synaptosomal amyloid beta and paired-helical fibrillary tau protein while increasing neuron survival. Additionally, astaxanthin nanoemulsion at 640 mg/kg bw significantly increased acetylcholine levels in the hippocampus and cerebellum. Astaxanthin nanoemulsion at all treatment dosages significantly reduced malondialdehyde, a lipid peroxidation product, and neuroinflammatory mediators (GFAP and TNF-α). Astaxanthin nanoemulsion supplementation has the potential to improve cognitive function and synaptic function by lowering amyloid beta and tau levels, as well as preserve neuron integrity by reducing neuroinflammation and lipid peroxidation, indicating that it may be able to treat some of the underlying causes of AD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dry eye disease (DED) predominantly results from elevated tear film osmolarity, which can not only cause ocular inconvenience but may lead to visual impairments, severely compromising patient well-being and exerting substantial economic burdens as well. Astaxanthin (AST), a member of the xanthophylls and recognized for its robust abilities to combat inflammation and oxidation, is a common dietary supplement. Nonetheless, the precise molecular pathways through which AST influences DED are still poorly understood. METHODS: Therapeutic targets for AST were identified using data from the GeneCards, PharmMapper, and Swiss Target Prediction databases, and STITCH datasets. Similarly, targets for dry eye disease (DED) were delineated leveraging resources such as the Therapeutic Target Database (TTD), DisGeNET, GeneCards, and OMIM databases, and DrugBank datasets. Interactions among shared targets were charted and displayed using CytoScape 3.9.0. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses were conducted to elucidate the functions of pivotal targets within the protein-protein interaction network. Molecular interactions between AST and key targets were confirmed through molecular docking using AutoDock and PyMOL. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using GROMACS 2022.3. Viability of human corneal epithelial cells (hCEC) was assessed across varying concentrations of AST. A mouse model of experimental DED was developed using 0.1% benzalkonium chloride (BAC), and the animals were administered 100 mg/kg/day of AST orally for 7 days. The efficacy of the treatments was assessed through a series of diagnostic tests to evaluate the condition of the ocular surface after the interventions. The levels of inflammation and oxidative stress were quantitatively assessed using methods such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot, and immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: Network pharmacology suggests that AST may alleviate DED by influencing oxidation-reduction signaling pathways and reducing oxidative stress provoked by BAC. In vivo experiments demonstrated an improved overall condition in AST-administered mice in contrast to the control group. Immunofluorescence staining analyses indicated a decrease in Keap1 protein in the corneal tissues of AST-treated mice and a significant increase in Nrf2 and HO-1 protein. In vitro studies demonstrated that AST significantly enhanced cell viability and suppressed reactive oxygen species expression under hyperosmotic (HS) conditions, thereby protecting the human corneal epithelium. CONCLUSION: AST is capable of shielding mice from BAC-induced DED, decelerating the progression of DED, and mitigating oxidative stress damage under HS conditions in hCEC cells. The protective impact of AST on DED may operate through stimulating the Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. Our research findings indicate that AST may be a promising treatment for DED, offering new insights into DED treatment."

Given the oxidative susceptibility of AXT during processing, storage, and digestion, along with the effectiveness of novel food-grade drug delivery systems, we engineered an AXT-loaded procyanidins (PCs) and sea cucumber peptide (SCP) nanoparticles (AXT@NPs) to enhance its bioavailability. The research results indicatedthat spherical AXT@NPs, approximately 686 nm in size, had a higher drug-loading capacity and an intelligent pH-response performance. Additionally, this carrier demonstrated excellent stability against temperature and ultra-violet radiation, as well as DPPH and ABTS free radical scavenging properties. In vitro cell experiments revealed that AXT@NPs significantly inhibited the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential caused by H2O2. The oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the formation of liver fibrosis. In vivo liver fibrosis studies in mice confirmed that AXT@NPs could effectively alleviate damaged liver tissues, decreasing collagen deposition, and reducing oxidative damage by extending the action time of AXT in liver tissue. These findings indicate that AXT@NPs offer a novel nutritional intervention strategy for antifibrosis therapy by significantly enhancing bioavailability and effectively reducing oxidative stress.",

The present comprehensive review explored the role of AXT in cancer prevention and treatment, emphasizing its cytotoxic mechanisms and modulation of key molecular pathways involved in cancer progression. AXT has demonstrated efficacy across a variety of cancer types, including nervous system, breast and gastrointestinal cancers, through its ability to induce apoptosis, inhibit metastasis and disrupt cell growth. The present review detailed both in vitro and in vivo studies highlighting the effectiveness of AXT in sensitizing cancer cells to chemotherapy, thereby enhancing therapeutic outcomes and potentially reducing treatment-related side effects. The incorporation of AXT in nanoparticle-based delivery systems has further improved its bioavailability and targeted action, showcasing its potential in advanced cancer therapies. However, despite promising experimental results, more comprehensive in vivo studies and clinical trials are necessary to validate the efficacy and safety of AXT in human populations. Such research would help standardize dosing, confirm interactions with conventional treatments and support the integration of AXT into clinical oncology as a natural, complementary approach to existing cancer treatments."

This study aimed to investigate the effects of 3 pasteurization methods, including low-temperature, long-time treatment at 63°C for 30 min (LTLT-1) and 65°C for 30 min (LTLT-2), and high-temperature, short-time treatment at 75°C for 15 s (HTST), on the physicochemical properties, stability, and biological activity of set yogurt fortified with astaxanthin-rich yolk.

The in vitro digestion results also confirmed that LTLT-2 had a high free radical scavenging capacity. Temperatures between 63°C and 65°C are within a safe range for preventing significant heat degradation of astaxanthin. Over the 21-d storage period, LTLT-2 significantly outperformed LTLT-1 and HTST regarding texture and particle size.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epilepsy, a prevalent neurological disorder, is distinguished by episodic abnormal discharges of neurons within the brain, resulting in transient brain dysfunction. Prior research has identified a novel form of cell death termed ferroptosis, which is intricately linked to the initiation and progression of epilepsy. It has been demonstrated that astaxanthin (AST) can inhibit ferroptosis by enhancing the activity of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), thereby providing cytoprotection. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether AST can alleviate neuronal ferroptosis in epilepsy by activating the Nrf2/GPX4 pathway, thereby exerting a neuroprotective effect. METHODS: By constructing a kainic acid (KA)-induced epilepsy mouse model and a KA-induced HT22 cell model, we employed behavioral testing, Western blot analysis, quantitative real-time reverse transcription qRT-PCR, ferroptosis-related assay kits, immunofluorescence staining, and other methods. These methodologies were utilized to investigate the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of AST on ferroptosis in KA-induced epileptic mice and HT22 neurons. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that AST pretreatment alleviates KA-induced epileptic behaviors and cognitive impairments in mice and mitigates ferroptosis indicators such as lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial morphological alterations. This neuroprotective effect appears to be mediated by the activation of the Nrf2/GPX4 signaling axis. In vitro studies further revealed that AST confers neuroprotection against KA-induced HT22 neuronal cell death, an effect that is abrogated by an Nrf2 inhibitor. Hence, the neuroprotective properties of AST are significantly associated with the modulation of the Nrf2-mediated ferroptosis pathway, as corroborated by bioinformatics analyses. CONCLUSION: The AST effectively inhibits neuronal ferroptosis in both in vivo and in vitro epilepsy models via the Nrf2/GPX4 pathway. This finding suggests that AST holds promise as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "Environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) are combustion products present in substantial numbers on atmospheric particulate matter with half-lives of days to years. The mechanisms linking EPFR exposure and respiratory diseases are unclear, but likely involve oxidative stress. We investigated the mechanisms by which EPFR exposure impact on well-differentiated primary human nasal epithelial cells from subjects sensitive or resistant to oxidant stressors, cultured at an air-liquid interface. We found that EPFR exposure induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) production; increased mitochondrial DNA copy number; down-regulated mucus production gene, Mucin-5AC (MUC5AC); up-regulated detoxifying gene, cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2)-regulated antioxidant pathways including Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)-Forkhead box O3 (FOXO3), mitophagy, PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1), apoptosis, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (p21), and inflammation, C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5). These results indicate that the well-differentiated respiratory epithelium can respond and activate redox reactions when exposed to sublethal concentrations of EPFRs. Increased susceptibility to EPFR exposure is conferred by failure to upregulate the mucin gene, MUC5AC, expression. Pre-treatment with astaxanthin prevented most of the negative impacts caused by EPFRs. Our results demonstrate that EPFRs can induce oxidative stress and cause damage to respiratory epithelium. A dietary antioxidant, astaxanthin, protected cells from EPFR-induced oxidant stress.",

However, the precise role of PA in NP is nebulous; further, whether Astaxanthin (AST), which exhibits analgesic properties, is involved in regulating PA in NP remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: We explored the role of PA in NP development and whether AST relieves NP by modulating PA levels; further, we identified novel therapeutic strategies for NP. METHODS: The L4 spinal nerve was ligated (SNL) to establish a mouse model of NP. The composition of the gut microbiota was analysed through 16S rRNA sequencing. PA in faeces, blood, and spinal cord were quantitatively measured using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Network pharmacology was used to identify therapeutic targets of PA for NP. The interactions between PA and its targets were analysed using molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and western blot. RESULTS: Analysis of faecal samples from SNL mice showed dysregulation in the gut microbiota and alterations in PA metabolism-related enzymes. GC-MS analysis revealed reduced PA levels in faeces, serum, and spinal cord tissue. Network pharmacology and molecular docking identified therapeutic targets shared between PA and NP, primarily related to inflammation regulation. Treatment with exogenous PA supplementation alleviated pain and inhibited inflammation in the intestine and spinal cord, including NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-κB activation. CONCLUSION: AST treatment modulated the gut microbiota, elevated PA levels, reduced inflammation, and strengthened the intestinal barrier, exerting an analgesic effect. Enhancing the levels of PA is a potentially novel mechanism underlying the analgesic effects of AST.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Doxorubicin (DOX), a widely employed chemotherapeutic agent in cancer treatment, has seen restricted use in recent years owing to its associated cardiotoxicity. Current reports indicate that doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) is a complex phenomenon involving various modes of cell death. Astaxanthin (ASX), a natural carotenoid pigment, has garnered significant attention for its numerous health benefits. Recent studies have shown that ASX has a broad and effective cardiovascular protective effect. Our study aims to investigate the protective effects of ASX against DIC and elucidate its underlying mechanisms. This has substantial practical significance for the clinical application of DOX. METHODS: Bioinformatic analyses were conducted using transcriptomic data from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database to identify key mechanisms underlying DIC. Network pharmacology was employed to predict the potential pathways and targets through which ASX exerts its effects on DIC. In vitro experiments, following pretreatment with ASX, H9C2 cells were exposed to DOX. Cell viability, injury and the protein expression levels associated with ferroptosis and autophagy were assessed. In the animal experiments, rats underwent 4 weeks of gavage treatment with various doses of ASX, followed by intraperitoneal injections of DOX every 2 days during the final week. Histological, serum, and protein analyses were conducted to evaluate the effects of ASX on DIC. RESULTS: The bioinformatics analysis revealed that ferroptosis and autophagy are closely associated with the development of DIC. ASX may exert an anti-DIC effect by modulating ferroptosis and autophagy. The experimental results show that ASX significantly mitigates DOX-induced myocardial tissue damage, inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and damage to H9C2 cells. Mechanistically, ASX markedly ameliorates levels of ferroptosis and autophagy both in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, ASX upregulates solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), while downregulating the expression of transferrin receptor 1 (TFRC), ferritin heavy chain (FTH1) and ferritin light chain (FTL). Additionally, ASX enhances the expression of P62 and decreases levels of Beclin1 and microtubule-associated proteins light chain 3 (LC3). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that ferroptosis and autophagy are critical factors influencing the occurrence and progression of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. ASX can alleviate DIC by inhibiting ferroptosis and autophagy."

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cardinal motor symptoms resulting from the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Although current medications may alleviate its symptoms, Parkinson's disease remains incurable. Astaxanthin is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent; however, its high susceptibility to oxidative degradation and low aqueous solubility limit its therapeutic efficacy. This study aimed to improve the pharmaceutical properties and neuroprotective effects of astaxanthin for Parkinson's disease treatment by using lactoferrin-conjugated astaxanthin-loaded liposomes (Lf-ASX-LPs). We successfully formulated Lf-ASX-LPs with high encapsulation efficiency (97.6%) and favorable physical characteristics (diameter: 109.8 ± 1.1 nm; polydispersity index: 0.18 ± 0.01; zeta potential: - 9.5 ± 1.1 mV). Lf-functionalized liposomes demonstrated enhanced cellular uptake and permeation in a Transwell® study, showing a 16.7-fold higher internalization in SH-SY5Y cells over 24 h than those without Lf conjugation. Additionally, Lf functionalization enhanced brain penetration ability, as demonstrated by a biodistribution study using nude mice, compared to LPs without Lf conjugation. In vitro, Lf-ASX-LPs reduced cell loss by 20.1% and oxygen species by 30.0%, ameliorated the reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential under 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium-induced toxicity by 40.1%, and reduced extracellular nitric oxide levels under lipopolysaccharide-induced toxicity by 32.0%, indicating cytoprotective and antioxidant effects. In a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinson's disease mouse model, treatment with Lf-ASX-LPs resulted in 5.0-, 3.1-, and 5.6-fold increases in dopamine levels, TH+ fiber density, and TH+ neurons, respectively, restoring dopaminergic neuron damage. The developed formulation also alleviated behavioral impairment and neuroinflammation, reducing astrocyte and microglial activation in the striatum and substantia nigra of the MPTP-treated animals. Thus, our formulation of Lf-ASX-LPs represents a promising strategy for providing neuroprotection and retarding Parkinson's disease progression.",

      "abstract": "Glucocorticoid (GC) is extensively used in clinical practice, and the osteonecrosis of the femoral head caused by them is a common issue in orthopedic surgery, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Astaxanthin (AST), a potent natural antioxidant, has an unexplored impact on GC-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (GIONFH). This study explores the effects and mechanisms of AST in counteracting dexamethasone (Dex)-induced ferroptosis and GIONFH. We developed a rat model of GIONFH using intraperitoneal Dex injections and conducted in vitro analysis by culturing osteoblasts (OBs) with Dex treatment. We assessed the impact of AST on Dex-treated OBs using C11-BODIPY and FerroOrange staining, mitochondrial functionality tests, and protein expression analyses through Western blot and immunofluorescence. The influence of AST on bone microarchitecture of femoral head in rat was assessed using micro-CT, hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry at imaging and histological levels. Our findings suggest that AST exerts an inhibitory effect on Dex-induced ferroptosis and GIONFH. In vitro, AST treatment increased glutathione and decreased malondialdehyde, lipid peroxidation, and mitochondrial-reactive oxygen species. Additionally, AST treatment also enhances the phosphorylation of STAT3, upregulates glutathione peroxidase 4 and osteogenic-related proteins, and stimulates bone formation. To delve deeper into the mechanism, the findings revealed that AST triggered activation of JAK2/STAT3 signaling. Moreover, the use of siRNA-STAT3 blocked the beneficial effect of AST in OBs cultivated with Dex. In brief, AST combats GIONFH by activating the JAK2/STAT3 pathway to inhibit ferroptosis.",

      "abstract": "Astaxanthin (AST), as a natural antioxidant, has broad application prospects in medicine and health products. However, its highly unsaturated structure and significant lipophilic characteristics limit its dispersibility and bioavailability, thereby restricting its application in food, medicines, and nutraceuticals. To overcome these limitations, researchers have proposed the use of nano delivery systems. This review summarizes various nanocarriers, including liposomes, nanostructured lipid carriers, nanoparticles, and others, and analyzes their advantages in enhancing the solubility, stability, and bioavailability of AST. Furthermore, the study focuses on targeted delivery systems achieved through biomolecular modifications, which enable precise delivery of AST to specific cells or tissues, enhancing therapeutic effects. Additionally, smart-responsive delivery systems, such as pH-responsive and light-sensitive systems, are also discussed, showing their immense potential in precise release and targeted therapy. These findings provide new perspectives for the precise nutrition and clinical applications of AST. Future research should further optimize the design of nanocarriers to enable broader applications.",

      "abstract": "Sepsis remains the leading cause of multiple-organ injury due to endotoxemia. Astaxanthin (ASTA), widely used in marine aquaculture, has an extraordinary potential for antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. Purinergic receptor (e.g., P2X7R) activation is a powerful signaling in the modulation of inflammation. The effect of ASTA was investigated on the regulation of oxidative stress, inflammatory response, apoptotic mediators, and P2X7R expression in the lung injury during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia. Twenty-four rats were blocked into four groups as Control, LPS, ASTA, and LPS + ASTA. LPS was administered by intraperitoneal injection and ASTA by gavage. Blood and lung samples were taken 6 h after the administrations. The methods were ELISA, western blotting, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry. Sepsis was confirmed by the elevations of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α levels in bloodstream. Lung injury was determined by histopathological changes. There were increased P2X7R expression, malondialdehyde (MDA), IL-1β, TNF-α, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), and Caspase-3 and decreased B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and glutathione (GSH) in the septic lung tissue (p < 0.05). ASTA treatment improved MDA, GSH, IL-1β, TNF-α, P2X7R, NF-κB, Caspase-3, and Bcl-2 levels and reduced P2X7R immunoreactivity and histological abnormalities in the lung (p < 0.05). The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, P2X7R expression, and apoptotic mediators in the lung is associated with LPS-induced endotoxemia. The ASTA administration appears to regulate the expressions of P2X7R, NF-κB, Bcl-2, and Caspase-3 improving the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory response of the lung tissue in sepsis, in vivo."

      "abstract": "Squid viscera, a byproduct of squid processing, contains oil rich in omega-3 fatty acids (up to 10% by mass) and the antioxidant astaxanthin. However, its high free fatty acid (FFA) content compromises stability. To address this, pilot-scale (200 L) enzymatic re-esterification of squid oil using immobilized lipase (Lipozyme RMIM) was demonstrated, resulting in high acylglyceride yields. The processed oil was analyzed for oxidation kinetics and thermodynamics using Rancimat, fatty acid composition using GC, omega-3 fatty acid positional distribution in the acylglyceride product using 13C NMR, and astaxanthin content. Lipase treatment reduced FFA levels from 44% to 4% and increased acylglycerides to 93% in squid oil. This reduction in FFA was accompanied by significantly increased stability (0.06 to 18.9 h by Rancimat). The treated oil showed no loss in astaxanthin (194.1 µg/g) or omega-3 fatty acids, including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). DHA remaining predominantly at sn-2 indicated that the naturally occurring positional distribution of this omega-3 FFA was retained in the product. Lipase treatment significantly enhanced oxidative stability, evidenced by improved thermodynamic parameters (Ea 94.15 kJ/mol, ΔH 91.09 kJ/mol, ΔS -12.6 J/mol K) and extended shelf life (IP25 74.42 days) compared to starting squid oil and commercial fish/squid oils lacking astaxanthin. Thus, lipase treatment offers an effective strategy for reducing FFA levels and producing oxidatively stable, astaxanthin-rich acylglyceride squid oil with DHA retained at the nutritionally favored sn-2 position.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Astaxanthin (ASX), a fat-soluble carotenoid mainly sourced from Haematococcus pluvialis, shows promise for clinical applications in chronic inflammatory diseases. This study investigates whether ASX can mitigate atherosclerosis (AS) by modulating macrophage ferroptosis and provides astaxanthin-loaded polylactic acid-glycolic acid nanoparticles (ASX-PLGA NPs) as comparison. METHOD: ApoE-/- mice were fed a high-fat diet with ASX or statin intervention. Plaque area, lipid aggregation, collagen content, and ferroptosis-related indicators were assessed. Moreover, ASX-PLGA NPs were synthesized and characterized and were used to pretreat macrophages induced with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). Indicators linked to ferroptosis and oxidative stress were detected. Finally, the expression of nuclear factor erythroid -related factor 2 (NRF2) was evaluated. RESULTS: ASX intervention significantly delayed the progression of AS plaques, characterized by reductions in plaque area and increased collagen fibers. The observed improvements in AS were consistent with statins. ASX-PLGA NPs demonstrate good safety and stability and have better therapeutic effects than ASX alone. Indicators linked to ferroptosis and oxidative stress were significantly improved in groups containing ASX in vivo and vitro. Additionally, ASX facilitated the nuclear translocation of NRF2, which could be attenuated with ML385, a specific inhibitor of NRF2. CONCLUSION: ASX-PLGA NPs have better therapeutic effects than ASX alone. The regulation of NRF2/SLC7A11/GPX4 represents a novel mechanism by which ASX can counteract ferroptosis and impede AS progression.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Gastric cancer (GC) is a significant global health issue with high incidence rates and poor prognoses, ranking among the top prevalent cancers worldwide. Due to undesirable side effects and drug resistance, there is a pressing need for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Understanding the interconnectedness of the JAK2/STAT3/mTOR/PI3K pathway in tumorigenesis and the role of Astaxanthin (ASX), a red ketocarotenoid member of xanthophylls and potent antioxidant and anti-tumor activity, can be effective for cancer treatments. This study aimed to investigate the effect of ASX-loaded nanoparticles on the survival of MKN-45 GC cells and the expression of JAK2/STAT3/mTOR/PI3K, offering insights into potential targeted therapies for GC. METHODS: The growth status and survival rate of MKN-45 GC cell lines were determined using the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide(MTT) assay, and the optimal IC50 concentration of ASX, PLGA, and ASX + PLGA was estimated. Also, the clonogenic assay was performed to determine the reproductive power and colony formation of under-treatment cells. Apoptosis and necroptosis of cells were evaluated using acridine orange (AO) staining. The western blot assessed the protein's level of expression and intensity (JAK2/STAT3/mTOR/PI3K). SPSS version 16 software was used for statistical analysis, P-value was considered lower than 0.05. RESULTS: Based on the results, increasing concentrations of ASX and ASX + PLGA led to a decrease in the viability of MKN-45 cells compared to the control group (P < 0.001). This value was lower for cells treated with ASX + PLGA (P = 0.003). The IC50 values for each of the studied groups (ASX, ASX + PLGA, and PLGA) were 81.45 µg/ml, 51.45 µg/ml, and 3.383 mg/ml, respectively. The levels of expression and intensity of JAK2, STAT3, and mTOR proteins in the Western blotting analysis under ASX + PLGA treatment increased compared to the control group. Conversely, the levels of expression and intensity of P-JAK2, P-STAT3, and P-mTOR proteins in the ASX + PLGA treatment group decreased by 41%, 34%, 37%, and 43%, respectively, compared to the control group. Protein expression levels and intensities of JAK2, STAT3, and mTOR significantly increased when treated with PLGA, ASX, and ASX + PLGA compared to the control group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The encapsulation of ASX in PLGA nanoparticles enhances drug stability, enables targeted delivery, and allows for sustained release. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of ASX-loaded nanoparticles in targeting JAK2/STAT3/mTOR/PI3K pathways in GC treatment. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms and clinical applications of this novel immunotherapy strategy.",

We have developed an antioxidant activity emulsion system to deliver astaxanthin into the liver to maximize its ability to protect the liver. In vitro, H-AXT intervention inhibited oxidative stress restored the level of mitochondrial membrane potential to 90 % of that of normal LO2 cells, and alleviated the imbalance of energy metabolism by protecting mitochondrial structure and function. Based on metabonomics, it was proved that H-AXT inhibited triglyceride accumulation by antagonizing lipid metabolism disorder. In DEHP-induced mice, H-AXT intervention mitigated liver damage by inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction, and alleviated metabolic dysfunction by regulating lipid levels and inhibiting fat accumulation. Meanwhile, H-AXT alleviated DEHP-induced testicular tissue damage and maintained the integrity of testicular tissue. The encapsulation of the emulsion system effectively promoted the liver uptake of astaxanthin to prevent liver diseases associated with metabolic disorders.",

      "abstract": "To investigate the synergistic effect of astaxanthin and curcumin on ovarian function in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) mice and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, fifty 4-week-old female mice were randomly divided into five groups: (i) normal control group; (ii) PCOS model group; (iii) PCOS + astaxanthin group; (iv) PCOS + curcumin group; and (v) PCOS + astaxanthin-curcumin. Throughout the study, various parameters were meticulously evaluated, including serum levels of key reproductive hormones (testosterone (T), estradiol (E2), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH)), as well as monitoring alterations in the estrous cycle, follicle development, and ovulation rates. Additionally, markers of oxidative stress and inflammation were measured. Findings revealed that PCOS mice exhibited disordered estrous cycle, polycystic ovarian morphologies, abnormal serum reproductive hormones and lipid metabolism, heightened oxidative stress, and augmented inflammatory responses. Notably, upon administration of the combined astaxanthin and curcumin, PCOS mice exhibited significant improvements in their estrous cyclicity and ovarian histology. The treatment led to a significant reduction in serum total cholesterol (TC) levels and normalization of T, E2, FSH, LH, and AMH levels. Moreover, there was a marked decrease in the levels of serum reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), indicating attenuation of oxidative stress. Concurrently, the activity of the antioxidant enzyme catalase (CAT) significantly increased, while proinflammatory cytokines interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the ovarian tissue were notably decreased. The combined treatment also resulted in a substantial increase in the number of ova and a significant decline in the rate of abnormal ova, with these therapeutic effects proving more effective compared to either astaxanthin or curcumin alone. In conclusion, the co-administration of astaxanthin and curcumin demonstrated a remarkable effect in improving abnormal lipid metabolism and restoring reproductive endocrine functions in PCOS mice. Furthermore, it effectively mitigated systemic and local oxidative stress and chronic inflammatory injury, thereby promoting follicular growth and enhancing ovulatory function in the context of PCOS."

      "abstract": "Astaxanthin is a xanthophyll carotenoid which has been associated with a number of health-promoting effects, including anti-aging; however, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In the present study, it was found that astaxanthin promoted the longevity of wild-type (N2) Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). The lifespan-extending effect of astaxanthin was associated with a significant decrease of lipofuscin accumulation and the reduction of the age-related decline in spontaneous motility. Meanwhile, astaxanthin enhanced the oxidative stress resistance in C. elegans, preventing the elevation of the reactive oxygen species and alleviating juglone-induced toxicity. Further studies revealed that astaxanthin treatment induced the expression of the skn-1 gene; besides, the lifespan-extending effect of astaxanthin relied on SKN-1. Additionally, the expression of age-1, a PI3K homolog gene, and let-363, a target of the rapamycin (TOR) homolog gene, was decreased, while the expression of PHA-4, a transcription factor negatively regulated by TOR signaling, was increased by astaxanthin treatment. PHA-4 has been demonstrated to regulate the expression of genes playing critical roles in the autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP). Consistently, several key genes related to ALP, including lgg-1, atg-5, vps-34, ncr-1 and asm-1 were upregulated in C. elegans treated with astaxanthin. Knockdown of pha-4 expression by siRNA prevented the elevation of the above ALP-related genes, while diminishing the lifespan-extension effect of astaxanthin. Overall, these results indicated that astaxanthin prolonged the lifespan of C. elegans via modulating the intracellular redox status and promoting PHA-4-mediated autophagy.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different concentrations of astaxanthin and Bidens Pilosa compound feed additives on the color and hypoxia tolerance of cherry shrimp (Neocaridina davidi var. red). Color parameters were assessed using CIELAB color space, and differential gene expression related to color and stress was analyzed using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to understand the gene regulatory mechanisms affecting color expression and stability. Over a 56-day rearing period, the feed additives AX100 (astaxanthin 100 mg/kg) and AX100+BP (astaxanthin 100 mg/kg + B. pilosa 5 g/kg) significantly reduced the color difference values compared to the standard sample (ΔE*ab), indicating notable color boosting effects. This included a reduction in lightness (L*), a decrease in color hue angle (h*) with AX100, and an increase in redness (a*) and chroma (C*) with AX100+BP. We further designed 22 color-related gene primers, 16 of which amplified the target fragment. Six gene sets exhibited significant differences among all feed treatment groups and were correlated with color expression. After 9 hours of hypoxic stress, body color remained stable in the feed additive groups, especially in the AX100 + BP and AX200 + BP (astaxanthin 200 mg/kg + B. pilosa 5 g/kg) groups, with color differences before and after hypoxic stress remaining below the discernible threshold of the human eye, indicating optimal color stability. Additionally, the CAT gene, among the stress-related genes that successfully amplified, showed significant differences among feed treatment groups and correlated with color stability based on color difference values. In conclusion, the composite addition of 100 mg/kg astaxanthin and 5 g/kg Bidens pilosa (AX100 + BP) was identified as the most effective treatment. This formulation significantly enhanced cherry shrimp color, evidenced by improved parameters such as decreased lightness and increased redness. Moreover, AX100 + BP demonstrated superior color stability under hypoxic conditions, with ΔE*ab values remaining below the discernible threshold of the human eye, highlighting its potential for maintaining optimal color during transportation.

Astaxanthin, a ketocarotenoid, has a variety of physiological activities. In this study, we investigated the effects of astaxanthin on dexamethasone-induced skeletal muscle atrophy and disorders of glycolipid metabolism. Male C57Bl/6J mice were administered dexamethasone alone or supplemented with different doses of astaxanthin (30 mg/kg/d, 60 mg/kg/d, 120 mg/kg/d) for 4 weeks. The results showed that astaxanthin improved locomotor performance and attenuated dexamethasone-induced reductions in skeletal muscle mass and cross-sectional area in mice. Further exploration of the mechanism revealed that astaxanthin was able to balance the catabolism and synthesis of skeletal muscle proteins and protect mitochondria by reducing the expression of the mitochondrial autophagy-associated proteins Lc3B and BNIP3. In addition, astaxanthin reduced the accumulation of fatty acid metabolites and visceral fat and improved the ability of skeletal muscle to utilize sugars, suggesting that astaxanthin may alleviate dexamethasone-induced disturbances in glycolipid metabolism. This study illustrates that astaxanthin can alleviate skeletal muscle atrophy and metabolic disturbances induced by long-term dexamethasone treatment. This suggests that astaxanthin may be a functional dietary supplement to reduce the side effects of glucocorticoid therapy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) caused by abnormal DNA methylation is confirmed to be widely present in oral potential malignant diseases (OPMDs). Carotenoids like lycopene and astaxanthin can regulate DNA methylation and exert anticancer effects. Therapeutic effect of astaxanthin in OPMDs and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) models is confirmed, but the relationship between the anti-cancer ability of astaxanthin and its DNA methylation regulation ability remains unclear. METHODS: Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) were used to provide biological information associated with DNA methylation. Methylation specific PCR was used to detect the methylation level of specific sites. Related markers were evaluated by qRT-PCR and western blot. CCK8 assay, cell scratch assay, flow cytometric analysis were performed to investigate the cell viability, migration, cell cycle, and apoptosis after treated with concentrations of astaxanthin. RESULTS: WGBS revealed that HOXA3 and SOX1 were the TSGs with significant differences in promoter CpG methylation of oral dysplastic keratinocytes (DOK) cells. After treatment with 8 μM astaxanthin, the promoter CpG methylation levels of the TSGs were significantly reduced, resulting in the increase in gene expression. The overall effect of astaxanthin on DOK cells is inhibiting cell viability, reducing cell migration, leading to cell cycle G0/G1 arrest, and promoting apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed significant differences in DNA methylation patterns among oral normal, dysplastic, and cancerous cells. Astaxanthin can reduce the promoter CpG methylation level of TSGs by reducing DNA methyltransferase 1 protein expression level, upregulating mRNA and protein expression, and subsequently modulating the biological behavior of DOK.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Neuropathic pain is a debilitating neurological disorder and is on the rise. Since no effective treatment has been so far approved to combat the complex pathological mechanisms behind neuropathic pain, finding new therapeutic candidates is of great importance. Astaxanthin (AST) is a carotenoid with strong antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. PURPOSE: The present research aimed to evaluate the ameliorative effects of AST on a rat model of neuropathic pain. METHODS: To induce neuropathic pain, a chronic constriction injury (CCI) model was employed. Accordingly, Wistar rats were divided into nine groups of six including sham, negative control group (CCI), positive control group gabapentin (100 mg/kg), AST (5, 10 mg/kg), flumazenil (0.5 mg/kg), naloxone (0.1 mg/kg), AST (10 mg/kg) + flumazenil (0.5 mg/kg), and AST (10 mg/kg) + naloxone (0.1 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14. To check the experimental signs of neuropathic pain and motor dysfunction, hot plate, acetone drop, and open field tests were used at the same time points. Additionally, biochemical assay and zymography were done on days 7 and 14 to assess the changes in catalase, glutathione and nitrite, as well as matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9). Besides, histological evaluations were performed for tissue damages on days 7 and 14. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Results indicated that intraperitoneal injection of AST improved allodynia, hyperalgesia, and locomotor activity after CCI. AST also increased catalase and glutathione while suppressing nitrite, MMP-2, and MMP-9 activity through opioid/benzodiazepine receptors. CONCLUSION: The results highlighted AST as a promising candidate against neuropathic pain with beneficial effects on motor function by suppressing inflammatory mediators, and augmenting antioxidant factors, passing through opioid/benzodiazepine receptors."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) develop with the gradual advancement of neuronal damage and dysfunction in the central nervous system (CNS). These disorders are mostly the outcomes of the improper sedimentation and accumulation of proteins, such as amyloid-β (Aβ), α-synuclein, and prions. Astaxanthin (AST) exists in different types of living organisms and displays antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions. This review has concentrated on the therapeutic characteristics of AST on NDs. METHODS: Data was collected by searching Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases. Articles selected for this review reported results on the neuroprotective properties of AST on NDs of studies conducted during the years 2000 to 2024. RESULTS: AST decreases soluble Aβ levels by stimulating the Aβ degradation enzyme. It also reduces inflammation in the substantia nigra (SN) by decreasing IBA1 expression, thereby lessening microglia activity. This carotenoid reduces demyelination by increasing the survival of oligodendrocytes cells and increasing the number of their progenitor cells. AST has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties and can play a role in the treatment of many NDs. CONCLUSION: There is no definitive treatment for some NDs. The use of AST and natural compounds can be an optimal method for preventing and treating NDs with few side effects.",

Methodology: Semen was collected from 3 manila ducks (Cairina moschata) using the cloaca massage technique twice a week. Fresh semen was evaluated macro and microscopically then polled and divided into 5 tubes of treatments. Each tube was diluted in DMSO4, DMSO6, DMSO8, DMSO10, and DMSO12. The semen of each treatment was loaded into a 0.25 mL straw and equilibrated at 5 °C for 2 h. Freeze above nitrogen vapor and stored a container of liquid nitrogen at -196 °C, then semen thawed in a water bath at 37 °C for 30 sec. Data were analyzed using One-Way ANOVA Analysis. Results of this showed that post-equilibration sperm motility and sperm viability have differed significantly (P<0.05) for each treatment, with the highest % sperm motility DMSO8 and DMSO6, this is also shown in post-thawing sperm motility and viability which have differed significantly (P<0.05) and the highest % sperm viability were DMSO8 and DMSO6. In conclusion, Frozen semen extender formulation of DMSO8 and DMSO6 which are used in manila duck semen cryopreservation was the best to other treatments to maintain % sperm motility and % sperm viability in post-equilibration and post-thawing. The highest sperm motility recovery rate was in DMSO8. The lowest sperm live and dead abnormality was in DMSO8. It is concluded that the combination of DMSO8 was the best in maintaining the quality of manila duck frozen semen."

      "abstract": "Astaxanthin is a red-orange keto-carotenoid exhibiting antioxidant activity. AST is mainly used in the cosmetic, food, and healthcare industries. Nevertheless, because of its anti-inflammatory effects and immune modulation activity, AST use in pharmacology has been proposed as an alternative for treating neurodegenerative disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, atherosclerosis, or diabetic foot ulcers, among others. However, before an AST clinical implementation, it is still necessary to solve challenges related to the use of AST, such as lack of solubility, poor bioavailability, and sensitivity to light, oxygen, and temperature. For that reason, the development of several biomaterials to encapsulate, protect, and dosage AST has been proposed in recent years. This review discusses the use of liposomes, hydrogels, and polymer micro and nanoparticles as vehicles for AST release based on available literature. Additionally, an analysis of released, encapsulated, and effective AST doses is presented, as well as the regulatory landscape of different delivery systems to reveal details of AST delivery, which should inform future strategies for implementing AST in the clinic.",

In this study, the influence of AST on the survival of H9c2 cardiomyocytes under hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)- and doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity was investigated. Under these conditions, the content of cytosolic Ca2+ was measured, and changes in the area of the mitochondrial mass, as well as in the content of the voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), the autophagy marker LC3A/B, and the pro-apoptotic transcription factor homologous protein (CHOP), were determined. It was found that AST removed the cytotoxic effect of H2O2 and DOX, while cell survival increased, and the mitochondrial mass did not differ from the control. At the same time, a decrease in the content of cytosolic Ca2+ and the restoration of the VDAC1 level to values close to the control were observed. The restoration of the CHOP level suggests a reduction in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in cells. The results allow us to consider AST as a potential agent in the prevention and/or treatment of cardiac diseases associated with oxidative stress."

      "abstract": "Hypertensive rats serve as a good experimental model for studying the pathophysiology of cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling leading to heart failure. In this study, we aimed to analyze the effect of astaxanthin and possible mechanisms involved in alleviating oxidative stress, fibrosis and inflammation that triggers cardiac remodeling using male uninephrectomized Long Evans rats. Cardiac hypertrophy and hypertension were induced in rats termed as 'FCA-Salt rats' by an oral administration of fludrocortisone acetate (FCA) and 1 % NaCl in drinking water. Biochemical assays showed that FCA-Salt rats exhibited an upregulation of oxidative stress markers AOPP, MDA and downregulation of NO in heart and kidney, which was reversed by astaxanthin treatment. Astaxanthin further regularized the reduced activities of antioxidant enzymes GSH, SOD and CAT in these tissues. ELISA revealed that astaxanthin significantly reduced the inflammatory response by reducing the elevated levels of IL-1β, IL-17a, and TNF-α and pro-fibrotic marker TGF-β1 in plasma. Real-time qPCR depicted an upregulation of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17A as well as signaling molecules TGF-β1, Smad2 and Smad3 in heart of FCA-Salt rats, which was reduced significantly by astaxanthin. Sirius red staining showed that the cardiac and renal fibrosis was significantly improved by astaxanthin treatment. Together, our results suggest that astaxanthin treatment is beneficial in protecting cardio-renal damage in hypertension through TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, hence, this molecule may be considered for the maintenance of cardio-renal health.",

      "abstract": "Elevated non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs), particularly stearic acid (SA), have a deleterious effect on oocyte maturation, leading to developmental damage and reproductive issues. High SA levels disrupt metabolic processes, inducing lipotoxicity that impairs oocyte quality and contributes to reproductive failures through early embryonic losses. This research investigates the lipotoxic effects of SA and assesses the protective potential of 6-Gingerol (6-G) and Astaxanthin (AX) on porcine oocytes during in vitro maturation (IVM). Herein, 6100 cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were exposed to various concentrations of SA (25-250 μM) to elucidate the concentration-dependent effect on oocyte viability, polar body extrusion (PBE) and cumulus cell expansion index (CCEI). However, the efficacy of 6-G (5-15 μM) and AX (2.5 μM) in combination with SA at 150 μM (SA6) concentration was evaluated to mitigate these adverse effects. The results indicated that SA6 substantially reduced oocyte viability, PBE and CCEI, demonstrating its toxic impact on oocyte developmental competence (p < 0.0001). Moreover, treatment with antioxidants such as SA6 + 6-G (10 μM) and SA6 + AX showed a considerable increase in viability and PBE compared to SA6 alone (p < 0.05). These findings demonstrate the importance of lipid metabolism in oocyte health, where dysregulation impairs reproductive capacity. Both 6-G and AX protected against lipotoxicity induced by SA6 while enhancing lipid homeostasis and the anti-oxidative defences necessary for maintaining cellular integrity. This study finds substantial evidence that optimising the microenvironment with specific antioxidants can improve oocyte quality and provide invaluable knowledge in reproductive technologies and fertility treatments.",

To alleviate the liver damage caused by alcohol, a type of astaxanthin (AXT) loaded nanoparticles were designed for dual targeting of hepatocytes and mitochondria. Firstly, galactooligosaccharides (GOS) were conjugated to whey protein isolate (WPI) and sea cucumber peptide (SCP) via the Maillard reaction, achieving a grafting degree of 29 %, then triphenylphosphonium (TPP) was linked by amide reaction. Secondly, AXT was loaded into the complex of SCP-WPI-GOS-TPP (SWGT) to form AXT@SCP-WPI-GOS-TPP(AXT@SWGT) nanoparticles. The Pearson coefficient increased from 0.69 to 0.76 after introducing TPP targeting moiety. In vivo experiments showed that AXT@SWGT significantly alleviated liver injury caused by alcohol. The vacuolation and fat accumulation associated with alcoholic liver injury was alleviated. The alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase activity were improved by 296.88 % and 34.19 %, respectively. AXT@SWGT significantly enhanced the biological activities of glutathione by 76.86 %, catalase by 145.42 %, and superoxide dismutase by 33.48 %, thereby alleviating oxidative stress. The results indicated that the AXT@SWGT might have the potential to intervene alcoholic liver injury via the dual targeting strategy.",

Astaxanthin (AX) possesses anti-inflammatory/antioxidant and purported ergogenic properties. This study examined the impact of supplementing the diet with 12 mg/d AX for four weeks on markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, cardiometabolic health, exercise capacity, and occupation-related performance in career firefighters. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover fashion, 15 male career firefighters (34.5 ± 7.4 years; 177.7 ± 7.0 cm; 95.6 ± 12.0 kg; 30.1 ± 2.9 kg/m2; 11.03 ± 6.85 years of service) ingested 12 mg/d of AX (AstaReal®, AstaReal AB, Nacka, SWE) or placebo (PLA) for four weeks while following a standardized resistance training program. After each treatment, testing sessions were completed to assess inflammatory markers, oxidative stress markers, cardiopulmonary exercise capacity, and performance to a fire ground test (FGT) consisting of nine fire suppressive activities. Data were analyzed using general linear model (GLM) analysis with repeated measures. Clinical significance was assessed via mean changes from baseline with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Analysis of mean percent changes from baseline revealed that AX supplementation lessened the inflammatory response to to performing an incremental maximal exercise test and attenuated increases in interleukin-1β, cortisol, and uric acid in response to performing fire suppressive activities compared to when they ingested PLA. However, most of these effects were within groups rather than between groups. Additionally, there was evidence that AX ingestion increased the ventilatory anaerobic threshold. Four weeks of AX supplementation did not significantly affect fasting markers of oxidative stress, blood lipids, performance during the FGT, general clinical chemistry panels, or self-reported side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide some evidence that AX supplementation may help mediate occupation-related inflammation in response to high-intensity, short-duration exercise in firefighters. More research is warranted to determine if long-term supplementation can improve cardiometabolic risk in this population. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN10901752.",

The alga treated with 25 μM DA combined with 1 g L-1 sodium chloride exhibited 7.63 %, 41.25 %, and 52.04 % increases in biomass (1.41 g L-1), astaxanthin content (32.37 mg/g), and astaxanthin productivity (3.51 mg L-1 d-1) respectively, compared with the salinity stress and high light. Exogenous DA treatment promoted lipid synthesis while reducing carbohydrate and protein contents. Moreover, carotenogenesis and lipogenesis-associated genes were upregulated under DA induction. Inhibition of reactive oxygen species and autophagy, along with mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, promoted astaxanthin accumulation under DA. Furthermore, DA application boosted astaxanthin biosynthesis by regulating the levels of respiratory metabolic intermediates, the γ-aminobutyric acid shunt, and important phytohormones. These findings present a potential and successful biotechnological approach for enhancing biomass and astaxanthin production in H. lacustris under stressful conditions.",

      "abstract": "Glucolipotoxicity (GLT) has emerged as established mechanism in the progression of diabetes. Identifying compounds that mitigate GLT-induced deleterious effect on β-cells are considered important strategy to overcome diabetes. Hence, in the present study, astaxanthin-s-allyl cysteine (AST-SAC) diester was studied against GLT in β-cells. Mus musculus pancreatic β-cell line (βTC-tet) was treated with high glucose (25 mM; HG) and 95 μM palmitate (PA) for 24 h to induce GLT. AST-SAC at various concentrations (5, 10, and 15 μg/ml) were treated to understand the protective effect against HG + PA exposure in β-cells. Under HG + PA exposure conditions oxidative stress, deregulation of mTOR pathway and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are witnessed. AST-SAC treatment eased oxidative stress, mitochondrial depolarization, DNA damage, calcium overload and accumulation of autophagosome against HG + PA exposure conditions thereby protected the cell viability of β-cells. AST-SAC maintained the level of proteins involved in mTOR pathway under HG + PA exposure conditions. Also, AST-SAC treatment has mitigated the increased expression of genes and proteins such as IRE1 and PERK involved in ER stress-mediated unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling pathways. In correspondence to it, the expression of genes involved in insulin secretion was preserved by AST-SAC. Due to these protective effects of AST-SAC the insulin secretion was well-maintained in β-cells under HG + PA exposure conditions. AST-SAC through normalizing antioxidant status and mTOR axis as well as preventing the harmful effect of ER-stress mediated UPR pathway has promoted the β-cell survival and insulin secretion against GLT. Simultaneously targeting oxidative stress/mTOR axis/ER stress is required to efficiently overcome GLT in β-cells.",

      "abstract": "A 9-week feeding trial was conducted to investigate the effects of different dietary sources of astaxanthin on fillet coloration, texture, and nutrient composition in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Eight diets were formulated to contain 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, and 125 mg/kg astaxanthin from wall-broken Haematococcus pluvialis (WBHPA), 100 mg/kg astaxanthin from wall-unbroken H. pluvialis (WUHPA), or chemically synthesized astaxanthin (CSA). Each diet was fed to triplicate groups of rainbow trout (mean initial weight of 561 g) twice daily (07:00 and 17:00) to apparent satiation for 9 weeks. Results showed that at the 100 mg/kg astaxanthin inclusion level, the CAS group had higher fillet gross energy, dorsal fillet redness, and dorsal fillet color card score compared to the WBHPA-100 group, with both being higher than the WUHPA group (P < 0.05). Fillet astaxanthin content, dorsal fillet yellowness, and lateral line redness and yellowness did not differ significantly between the CSA and WBHPA-100 groups (P > 0.05), but were higher than the WUHPA group. When WBHPA was used, the inclusion of 50-100 mg/kg decreased fillet lightness but increased fillet redness, while better fillet texture was served at 75-125 mg/kg. Dietary 25-125 mg/kg WBHPA inclusion increased fillet astaxanthin and gross energy concentrations, with minor effects on fatty acid compositions of fillet. Inclusion of over 100 mg/kg astaxanthin regardless of source decreased fillet threonine and serine contents, and the WBHPA-100 group had lower fillet glycine and alanine contents compared to the control group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, CSA had the most significant impact on fillet coloration and energy deposition in rainbow trout, while WUHPA had the least favorable effect. Additionally, the wall-breaking treatment of H. pluvialis can improve the effect of astaxanthin on fillet coloration and nutrient composition in rainbow trout, with a recommended dose range of 75-100 mg/kg."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy is still a clinical problem. The aim of this study was to determine whether astaxanthin, a substance that inhibits mitogen-activated protein kinases, activates nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 and influences N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, affects nociceptive transmission in mice with diabetic neuropathy. METHODS: The studies were performed on streptozotocin-induced mouse diabetic neuropathic pain model. Single intrathecal and intraperitoneal administrations of astaxanthin at various doses were conducted in both males and females. Additionally, repeated twice-daily treatment with astaxanthin (25 mg/kg) and morphine (30 mg/kg) were performed. Hypersensitivity was evaluated with von Frey and cold plate tests. RESULTS: This behavioral study provides the first evidence that in a mouse model of diabetic neuropathy, single injections of astaxanthin similarly reduce tactile and thermal hypersensitivity in both male and female mice, regardless of the route of administration. Moreover, repeated administration of astaxanthin slightly delays the development of morphine tolerance and significantly suppresses the occurrence of opioid-induced hyperalgesia, although it does not affect blood glucose levels, body weight, or motor coordination. Surprisingly, astaxanthin administered repeatedly produces a better analgesic effect when administered alone than in combination with morphine, and its potency becomes even more pronounced over time. CONCLUSIONS: These behavioral results provide a basis for further evaluation of the potential use of astaxanthin in the clinical treatment of diabetic neuropathy and suggest that the multidirectional action of this substance may have positive effects on relieving neuropathic pain in diabetes.",

Using methods of spectrophotometry, spectrofluorimetry, and Western blotting analysis, it was shown that treatment of the cells with AST contributed to the increase in the number of H9c2 cells resistant to H2O2 and doxorubicin, while maintaining the value of their mitochondrial transmembrane potential, reducing intracellular production of reactive oxygen species, and increasing intracellular content of the mitophagy markers PINK1, Parkin, and prohibitin 2.

In order to examine the impact of various ultrasonic energies (0 W-300 W) on the structural characteristics of the complex and the stability of the emulsion, the SPI-HA complex was created via ultrasonography. The findings demonstrated that ultrasonication may had an impact on the hydrophobic, electrostatic, and hydrogen bonding interactions between SPI and HA, which caused the protein structure to unfold and reveal the interior hydrophobic amino acid residues. Moreover, ultrasonication enhanced the emulsification qualities of SPI-HA complexes by lowering their average particle size. The rheological findings demonstrated that the emulsion's viscosity and energy storage modulus (G') were considerably decreased by the ultrasonic treatment. The appearance of the emulsions and optical microscopy results further indicated that the emulsions prepared from SPI-HA had superior storage stability, pH stability, and light stability compared to pure SPI. SPI-HA exhibited superior emulsion stability and lower particle size at 150 W ultrasonic power. The AST incorporated in the emulsion was also well protected. The emulsion effectively slows down the degradation of AST. The findings of this study may help create more robust and natural emulsion delivery systems that guarantee the continuous or regulated release of lipophilic bioactive compounds.",

METHODS: We employed a variety of techniques including real-time quantitative PCR, Western blot, ELISA, and dual-luciferase reporter gene assays to explore AST's molecular effects. Additionally, the efficacy of AST-loaded sustained-release microspheres was evaluated in vitro and in a mouse model of osteoarthritis. RESULTS: AST significantly enhanced SOD1 expression, reducing apoptosis and inflammation in damaged cells.

Our study aims to clarify ferroptosis' function in post-MI cardiac recovery, explore the consequences of iron overload and ferroptosis for myocardial remodeling, and assess the effects of Liproxstatin-1 (Lipro-1) treatment on macrophage functionality. Moreover, we examine the potential of Astaxanthin (ASTX), recognized for its antioxidative properties, to mitigate ferroptosis during MI recovery and its subsequent ramifications for myocardial remodeling. Our results demonstrate persistent ferroptosis during MI recovery, marked by decreased Glutathione Peroxidase 4 and increased Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long-Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4) and Ferroportin 1 alongside elevated lipid peroxidation and iron levels up to D21. We identified a significant correlation between ferroptosis and macrophage activity, noted by the increase in macrophage populations co-expressing GPX4 and ACSL4 markers in the peri-infarct area by D21. Liproxstatin-1 treatment reduced macrophage (CD68 +) counts, promoted M2 polarization decreased inflammation, and improved cardiac function. Myocardial remodeling was improved in Lipro-1-treated rats, as shown by decreased fibrosis and reduced levels of α-SMA, Collagen I, and Collagen III proteins. ASTX treatment also exhibited an inhibiting effect on ferroptosis indicators, and encouraged M2 macrophage polarization, reduced inflammation, and enhanced both cardiac function and myocardial remodeling, mirroring the beneficial effects observed with Lipro-1. In summary, the interactions between ferroptosis, macrophage polarization, and myocardial remodeling are crucial for cardiac function improvement post-MI. Lipro-1 and ASTX emerge as promising therapeutic agents by modulating post-MI ferroptosis and related immune responses.",

Many patients prefer to conceive with their eggs, underscoring the need for improved treatments. This study explores astaxanthin potential as a COS adjuvant to improve ovarian response and assisted reproductive technology (ART) outcomes, considering its impact on oxidative stress (OS), inflammation, and apoptosis, which are key factors in POR. METHODS: In this randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 60 infertile POR patients from POSEIDON Group 4 (the poorest prognosis category, age > 35 and poor ovarian reserve (anti-müllerian hormone < 1.2 ng/ml or antral follicle count < 5) undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection were enrolled. Patients were assigned to receive either 12 mg/day AST or placebo for eight weeks. All patients underwent a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist regimen for COS. ART outcomes were compared between groups. Blood serum and follicular fluid (FF) were analyzed for OS markers (superoxide dismutase [SOD], total antioxidant capacity [TAC], and malondialdehyde [MDA]), and pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 [IL-6], interleukin-8 [IL-8], and vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]) via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits, and cell-free DNA [cfDNA] (apoptotic marker) via ALU quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: After the intervention, the AST group exhibited a significant elevation in serum (P = 0.013) and TAC (P = 0.030), accompanied by a significant reduction in serum MDA (P = 0.005). No significant differences between AST and placebo groups were observed in OS markers in FF. AST group showed significant reductions in the serum IL-6 (P < 0.001), IL-8 (P = 0.001), and VEGF (P = 0.002) levels following AST therapy. In the AST group, FF levels of IL-6 (P = 0 < 001), IL-8 (P = 0.036), VEGF (P = 0.006), and cfDNA (P < 0.001) were significantly lower than in the placebo group. Between-group comparisons showed significant differences in the alterations of serum SOD (P = 0.027), IL-6 (P < 0.001), and IL-8 (P = 0.035) levels between AST and placebo groups. The AST group showed significant increases in the number of retrieved oocytes (P = 0.003), MII oocytes (P = 0.004), frozen embryos (P = 0.037), and high-quality embryos (P = 0.014) compared to the placebo group. CONCLUSION: AST shows promise as a COS adjuvant therapy, potentially enhancing some ART outcomes in POR through alleviating OS, inflammation, and apoptosis.

      "abstract": "Varicocele (VC) is widely recognized as a prevalent etiological factor contributing to male infertility. It has been established that the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a significant role in the progression and development of VC. Antioxidants may regulate ROS levels in these patients. Astaxanthin (ASX) is a carotenoid compound with notable antioxidant and anti-inflammatory characteristics. The current study postulated that the administration of ASX following varicocelectomy (VCT) could potentially enhance antioxidant status and semen quality in these patients. A total of 40 infertile males with clinical VC and abnormal semen analyses were randomly assigned to take part in the current trial. For 3 months following surgery, the intervention group took ASX (6 mg/day) while the control group received a placebo. After intervention, semen parameters, antioxidant status, and pro-inflammatory cytokines were compared between the two groups. Regarding semen parameters, antioxidant treatment led to a significant improvement in total and progressive motility in the treatment group (p < 0.05). Additionally, ASX led to a considerable increase in the expression levels of NRF2, Keap1, SOD2, SOD3, and BCL2, though the enhancement in the expression level of SOD3 was not statistically significant (p > .05). However, ASX significantly decreased the BAX expression level (p < .05). Even though the level of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of seminal fluid (SF) increased significantly in the treatment group (p < .05), the level of total oxidative stress (TOS) in SF did not differ substantially between treatment and control groups (p > .05). Based on inflammatory factors in SF, ASX led to a considerable reduction in levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 (p < .05). Our findings demonstrated that ASX treatment provides an important contribution to VCT outcomes by modulating antioxidant status and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Our results indicated that ASX may be beneficial as an adjuvant therapy for infertile men following VCT."

INTRODUCTION: The process of a cancerous development is facilitated by the accumulation of senescent cells. This justifies the incorporation of anti-senescent medications during splenic irradiation (SI). METHODS: In this study senescence was induced in the spleen of male albino rats by radiation exposure (5Gy-single whole body gamma-irradiation) then after 2 weeks, oral astaxanthin regimen was started once daily in a dose of 25 mg/kg for 7 consecutive days. Concurrent control groups were carried out. RESULTS: the present data reflected that irradiation provoked an increase in the oxidative stress biomarkers (nitric oxide, lipid peroxidation and total reactive oxygen species levels)and the inflammatory biomarkers (Myeloperoxidase and interleukin-6). In addition irradiation led to the over expression of stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) along with the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (p21) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (p16) increment with elevation of tumor suppressor protein (p53) level. However, reduced glutathione contents and catalase activity were reduced post irradiation in spleen tissues, all these changes reflecting induction of cellular senescence. Astaxanthin treatment showed an improvement in the antioxidant/oxidative stress balance, inflammatory biomarkers, histopathological examination and immunohistochemical expressions of the tested proteins in the irradiated rats. CONCLUSION: the current findings offer a new insight into the senomorphic effect of astaxanthin following radiation-induced spleen senescence via STING, mTOR, and TLR4 signalling pathways.",

Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of AXT in AIC mitigation remain to be elucidated. Consequently, this study endeavors to elucidate the mechanism of AXT against AIC, employing an integrated approach. METHODS: Network pharmacology, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations were harnessed to explore the molecular mechanism underlying AXT's action against AIC. Furthermore, the in-vitro AIC model was established with the H9c2 cell to generate transcriptome data for validation. RESULTS: A total of 533 putative AXT targets and 1478 AIC-related genes were initially screened by database retrieval and bioinformatics analysis. A total of 248 potential targets of AXT against AIC and several signaling pathways were identified by network pharmacology and enrichment analysis. Two core genes (CCL2 and NOS3) and the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications were further highlighted by transcriptome validation based on the AIC in-vitro model. Additionally, molecular docking and dynamics analyses supported the robust binding affinity of AXT with the core targets. CONCLUSION: The study suggested that AXT might ameliorate AIC through the inhibition of CCL2 and NOS3 as well as AGE-RAGE signaling, which provide a theoretical basis for the development of a strategy against AIC."

METHODS: In this study, the protective effects of dietary supplementation with krill oil (KO), fish oil (FO), and astaxanthin (ASX) on an ethanol-induced gastric ulcer model were compared during biochemical and histological observations. Sprague-Dawley (n = 64) rats randomly divided into four groups-normal control (vehicle), KO, FO, and ASX groups-received the supplements via the orogastric route at a rate of 2.5% (v/w) of their daily feed consumption for 4 weeks. Then, ulcer induction was performed with ethanol. RESULTS: The ulcer group showed increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), chemiluminescence (CL), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and decreased levels of glutathione in the gastric tissues. While KO, FO, and ASX supplementation decreased chemiluminescence levels in the ulcer group, only ASX supplementation decreased MDA levels and MPO activity. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, supplementation with KO or FO has a similar protective effect against ethanol-induced ulcer damage, as it inhibits ROS formation and reduces lipid peroxidation. However, ASX supplementation has a higher protective effect than KO or FO supplementations against experimental ethanol-induced gastric lesions in rats, as it inhibits ROS formation and reduces neutrophil infiltration and lipid peroxidation.",

Astaxanthin (AST), a well-known natural ketone-type carotenoid, has demonstrated strong antioxidant properties. This study investigates the impact of astaxanthin supplementation on the physiological state of porcine ovarian granulosa cells cultured in vitro. Variations in morphology, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and the expression of apoptosis and anti-oxidation-related genes in porcine GCs from different passages were observed. Significant morphological changes, increases in apoptosis, and decreases in antioxidant capacity resulting from passage were observed. Subsequently, treatment with 5 μmol/L astaxanthin significantly enhanced cell viability, proliferation, antioxidant capacity and mitochondrial function while also regulating the estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) levels. Additionally, the gene expression of antioxidation, E2, and P4 synthesis markers was assessed, revealing reduced apoptosis and ROS levels in porcine GCs. In conclusion, supplementation with 5 μmol/L astaxanthin in vitro effectively enhances the physiological condition of porcine GCs and optimizes the culture system for these cells in vitro. Optimizing the culture system of porcine GCs in vitro can simulate the function of granulosa cells in vivo and provide a theoretical reference for further promoting follicular development, which is beneficial to improving sow fertility in actual production."

Astaxanthin (AST) has multiple functions, including anti-inflammatory property, but it is unclear whether AST plays a key role in CP/CPPS and how it works. This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of AST on CP/CPPS in rats and the underlying mechanism. METHODS: A CP/CPPS rat model was induced by intraprostatic injection of carrageenan and the blood specimens and prostates were harvested for further research after oral administration of AST for 4 weeks. RESULTS: Tactile allodynia test showed that AST ameliorated chronic pelvic pain in a dose-depended manner. In addition, histological evaluation indicated that AST alleviated CP/CPPS rat prostate histological inflammation. Meanwhile, AST suppressed the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Besides, AST inhibited the activities of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2). Furthermore, AST decreased the activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our study has shown that AST exerts an anti-inflammatory and protective effect against CP/CPPS and the function is mediated at least through the suppression of NF-κB signaling pathway. These results provide evidence of AST as the potential agents for the treatment of CP/CPPS."

The system constructed an Ast-CS-TP emulsion with high encapsulation efficiency and an excellent stability profile by utilizing the opposite charge properties of CS and TP. This study evaluated the effects of different stresses (including temperature, salt addition, pH, UV irradiation, and centrifugal force) on the emulsion's stability. To further investigate the protective mechanism of the emulsions, we performed antioxidant activity experiments after UV treatment. Additionally, an in vitro digestion experiment was conducted to assess the behavior of Ast emulsion under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. The stability correlation coefficients were calculated using the Python database Pandas. The results showed that Ast-CS-TP emulsions exhibited turbidity and enhanced homogeneity with a small particle size of around 400 nm and a high absolute zeta potential of 35 mV and exhibited excellent stability under various stresses. The Ast-CS-TP emulsions also exhibited pH-responsive release at pH ≥ 7, consistent with pH changes in the gastrointestinal tract, and were stable in highly concentrated salt solutions. We found that the CS and TP layers significantly improved the photostability of Ast. CS and TP significantly enhanced Ast's oral bioavailability. The stability correlation coeffcients showed that pH and salt concentration were the largest factors that affected the stability of the emulsion. This study provided important insights into the encapsulation and targeting of Ast, providing a theoretical foundation and technical guidance for the comprehensive utilization of Ast.",

This study enrolled 92 patients with PCOS who were continuously supplemented with ACN for three months prior to IVF/ICSI treatment from 2021 to 2023, and selected 92 patients who did not receive the treatment during the same period as controls. Baseline characteristics, ovulation induction outcomes, and pregnancy outcomes were compared between the two groups. In addition, the body mass index (BMI), anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), antral follicle counting (AFC), fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistant (HOME-IR), and basal sex hormones of the supplementary group patients before and after treatment were compared. The results showed that there were no significant differences in the patient's duration of stimulation, total gonadotropin dose, peak E2 levels, and number of retrieved oocytes between the two groups. However, the number of 2 pronucleus (PN) fertilization, transferable embryos, and high-quality embryos was significantly higher in the ACN group compared with the control group. For both fresh and frozen embryo transplantation, positive pregnancy outcomes increased in PCOS patients who received supplementation of ACN for 3 months. In addition, after 3 months of supplementing with ACN, the patient's BMI, AMH, fasting insulin, HOME-IR, basal luteinising hormone (bLH), and basal testosterone (bT) decreased compared to before treatment.

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic joint disease highly associated with an imbalance in the network of inflammatory factors and typically characterized by oxidative stress and cartilage damage. Moreover, the specificity of the joint structure makes it difficult for drugs to achieve good penetration and effective enrichment in the joint cavity. Therefore, therapeutic strategies that increase the specific targeting of drugs to inflammatory joint and incorporate antioxidative stress effects are important to improve the efficacy of OA. Here, we developed a folic acid-modified liposomal nanoparticle (AST@Lip-FA) loaded with the antioxidant astaxanthin (AST) to enhance the water solubility and stability of AST and to target the delivery of AST to the site of OA, leading to a significant improvement in therapeutic efficacy. In vitro experiments demonstrated that, due to the recognition by FA of the receptor folate receptor β on the surface of activated macrophages, the cellular uptake efficiency of AST@Lip-FA was increased. Meanwhile, intracellularly overexpressed inflammatory mediators such as reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide were efficiently removed by AST@Lip-FA. In addition, in the ACLT-induced OA mouse model, AST@Lip-FA was precisely enriched in the inflamed joints and achieved long-term retention, fully utilizing the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and cartilage-protecting effects of AST to effectively alleviate the progression of OA. In summary, AST@Lip-FA has an important prospect as a potential and effective therapeutic strategy for OA.",

At present, the current treatments available for GBM patients can only prolong their overall survival and cannot provide a complete cure. Discovering an effective therapy against the disease is a challenge due to its recurrence and resistance to common available treatments for GBM. Several natural products have been documented to possess the potential to function as anticancer agents through diverse mechanisms. Astaxanthin (AXT) is an orange-red pigment that is a natural lipophilic and xanthophyll carotenoid derived mostly from microalgae. Numerous studies have examined that AXT impacts GBM cells in laboratory settings and animal models. This review aims to provide the latest information about the potential of astaxanthin as a novel therapeutic option for GBM. AXT has been targeted more on reactive oxygen species (ROS), and suppressed tumor growth in vitro and in vivo conditions. The available data suggests that AXT might serve as a key component in the development of innovative cancer therapies, especially for glioblastoma."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Astaxanthin (AST) has been widely recognized for its therapeutic potential in chronic inflammatory ailments. This study investigates the therapeutic efficacy and underlying mechanisms of AST in the management of chronic prostatitis (CP). METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into control, complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), and CFA + AST groups. CFA was used to induce the CP model, and saline was used for the control group. Inflammation of the prostate was detected 28 days after oral administration of AST. qRT-PCR and ELISA were used to detect pro-inflammatory factors in RWPE-1 and WPMY-1 cells. Potential targets of AST for CP were explored by network pharmacology, and related proteins were detected by Western blotting. RESULTS: Oral administration of AST alleviated the increase in prostate stroma and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration in CP rats. The IC50 of AST-treated RWPE-1 and WPMY-1 cells for 48 h were 171 and 212.1 μM, respectively. AST pretreatment reduced IL-6 and IL-8 expression in these cells. PPI network, GO, and KEGG enrichment analyses suggested that the antiinflammatory effect of AST was associated with the ERK1/2 pathway. Western blotting showed that AST inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In addition, AST and ERK1/2 pathway inhibitors (U0126) synergistically inhibited LPS-induced inflammation in prostate cells. CONCLUSION: Our study identified the potential of AST in the treatment of CP. However, subsequent randomized controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy."

      "abstract": "Cypermethrin is a toxic pesticide that has infiltrated water bodies due to its widespread use. This contamination has led to detrimental effects on the immune organs of aquatic species, including fish. The natural fat-soluble orange-red carotenoid, astaxanthin (MAT), derived from microalgae, possesses anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory properties. To elucidate the mechanism of CY induced damage to carp liver cells and assess the potential protective effects of MAT, we established a carp hepatocyte model exposed to CY and/or MAT. Hepatocytes from carp (Cyprinus carpio) were treated with either 8 μM CY or 60 μM MAT for 24 h. Upon exposure CY, a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed alongside a diminution in the activities of key antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), suggesting an impairment of cellular antioxidant capacity. Subsequently, acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining and flow cytometry analysis revealed that hepatocytes exposed to CY exhibited a higher incidence of necroptosis, associated with an elevated mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration, which contributed to cellular dysfunction. Furthermore, exposure to CY also activated the ROS-NF-κB-RIPK3/MLKL signaling pathway, increasing the levels of necroptosis-related regulatory factors (RIP1, RIP3, and MLKL) in hepatocytes and the expression of inflammatory genes (IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-1β, and TNF-α), which led to immune dysfunction in hepatocytes. The immunotoxic effects induced by CY were mitigated by MAT treatment, suggesting its potential in alleviating the aforementioned changes caused by CY. Overall, the data suggested that MAT therapy could enhance hepatocyte defenses against CY-induced necroptosis and inflammatory responses by regulating mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis and inhibiting the ROS-NF-κB-RIPK3/MLKL signaling cascade. This study elucidated the potential benefits of employing MAT to protect farmed fish from agrobiological hazards during CY exposure, underscoring the practical applications of MAT in aquaculture.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Astaxanthin (ASX) has been documented to exert beneficial influence on various processes in fish. Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) serves as a common model for studying glucose-induced liver disease, making it imperative to investigate the regulatory mechanisms underlying its liver health. METHODS: Largemouth bass were fed with a control diet (CON), a high carbohydrate diet (HC), or a HC diet supplemented astaxanthin (HCA) for 8-weeks, followed by the glucose tolerance test (GTT). Primary hepatocytes were treated with low glucose and high glucose combined with different concentrations of astaxanthin for 48 h. The histopathology, enzymology, transcriptomics, molecular biology and cell biology were combined to investigate the mechanism of liver injury. RESULTS: This study provides evidence for the protective effects of ASX against growth performance reduction and hepatic liver injure in largemouth bass fed HC diet. In GTT, HCA diet exhibited an improvement in glucose tolerance following glucose loading. Although HCA diet did not restore the expression of insulin resistance-related genes in livers at different time during the GTT, the addition of ASX in the long-term HC diet did improve the insulin resistance pathway by regulating the PTP1B/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Hepatic transcriptome analyses showed that ASX plays an essential role in the modulation of glucose homeostasis in response to treated with HC diet. In in vitro study, ASX treatment resulted in an exaltation in cell viability and a reduction in the rate of cell apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Additionally, astaxanthin was observed to improve apoptosis induced by high-glucose via p38MAPK/bcl-2/caspase-3 signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Astaxanthin exhibited a protective effect against apoptosis by regulating p38MAPK/bcl-2/caspase-3 pathway, and ameliorated insulin resistance by activating the PTP1B/PI3K/Akt pathway. This study elucidated the mechanism of astaxanthin in the liver injury of largemouth bass from a new perspective and provided a new target for the treatment of insulin resistance."

A comprehensive comparison of seven distinct methods for disrupting cell walls, including dimethyl sulfoxide treatment, lactic acid treatment, sodium hydroxide treatment, β-glucanase enzymatic digestion, β-mannanase enzymatic digestion, and a combined enzymatic treatment involving both β-mannanase and β-glucanase was conducted. The results identified the lactic acid method as the most effective in disrupting the cell walls of P. rhodozyma. The software, Design Expert, was used in the process of extracting astaxanthin from cell lysates using a subcritical extraction method. Through fitting analysis and response surface optimization analysis by Design Expert, the optimal extraction conditions were determined as follows: an extraction temperature of 41 °C, extraction frequency of two times, and extraction time of 46 min. These parameters facilitated the efficient extraction, concentration, and enrichment of astaxanthin from P. rhodozyma, resulting in an astaxanthin concentration of 540.00 mg/L.

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent gynecological-endocrinological disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularities, and metabolic disturbances. Recent research has highlighted the role of oxidative stress and chronic inflammation in exacerbating PCOS symptoms and impeding reproductive outcomes. Astaxanthin, a potent antioxidant found in marine organisms, has been suggested as a potential therapeutic intervention due to its ability to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. This meta-analysis systematically reviews randomized controlled trials assessing the impact of astaxanthin supplementation on oxidative stress and reproductive outcomes in women with PCOS. Data from four trials were analyzed, focusing on markers of oxidative stress and reproductive health metrics. The meta-analysis utilized fixed and random-effects models to synthesize results, with heterogeneity assessed using Chi-square and I2 statistics. The findings indicate that while astaxanthin significantly improves markers of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in follicular fluid, it does not show a consistent effect on other oxidative stress biomarkers such as malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), or superoxide dismutase (SOD). Reproductive outcomes, including oocyte quality and the number of high-quality embryos, showed moderate improvements, although effects on fertilization rates and pregnancy outcomes were insignificant. The analysis highlights variability in study designs and dosing, suggesting a need for further research with standardized protocols and larger sample sizes. Future studies should focus on determining optimal dosing, exploring mechanistic pathways, and investigating the combined effects of astaxanthin with other interventions. Longitudinal studies are needed to assess long-term benefits and safety, and personalized approaches could enhance treatment efficacy for individuals with PCOS.",

Emulsion stability against environmental stresses (i.e., pH, salt addition, thermal treatment, storage and in vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion) and its astaxanthin encapsulation against degradation during storage and in vitro digestion were evaluated. Results indicated that a total biopolymer concentration of 0.5% was optimal, with the preferred sodium caseinate-sugar beet pectin ratios for L and M emulsions being 1:1 and 1:3, respectively. L emulsions generally exhibited smaller droplet diameters than M emulsions across all ratios, except at 1:3. Lowering the pH to 1.5 substantially reduced the net negative charge of all emulsions, with only L emulsions precipitating at pH 3. M emulsions showed greater tolerance to salt addition, remaining stable up to 500 mM sodium and calcium concentrations, whereas L emulsions destabilized at levels exceeding 50 mM and 30 mM, respectively. All emulsions were stable when heated at 37 °C or 90 °C for 30 min. Astaxanthin degradation rates increased with prolonged storage, reaching 61.66% and 54.08% by day 7 for L and M emulsions, respectively. Encapsulation efficiency of astaxanthin in freshly prepared M emulsions (86.85%) was significantly higher compared to L emulsions (72.82%). M emulsions had 30% and 25% higher encapsulation efficiency of astaxanthin than L emulsions after in vitro digestion for 120 min and 240 min respectively. This study offers suggestions for interface design and process optimization to improve the performance of protein-polysaccharide emulsion systems, such as in beverages and dairy products, as well as their delivery effect of bioactives."

      "abstract": "Dry eye disease (DED) is a common eye disease in clinical practice. The crucial pathogenesis of DED is that hyperosmolarity activates oxidative stress signaling pathways in corneal epithelial and immune cells and, thus, produces inflammatory molecules. The complex pathological changes in the dry eye still need to be elucidated to facilitate treatment. In this study, we found that astaxanthin (AST) can protect against DED through the SLC7A11/GPX4 pathway. After treatment with AST, the SLC7A11/GPX4 pathway was positively activated in DED both in vivo and in vitro, accompanied by enhanced autophagy and decreased ferroptosis. In hyperosmolarity-induced DED corneal epithelial cells, AST increased the expression of ferritin to promote iron storage and reduce Fe2+ overload. It increased glutathione (GSH) and GPX4, scavenged reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxide, and rescued the mitochondrial structure to prevent ferroptosis. Furthermore, inhibition of ferroptosis by ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), iron chelator deferoxamine mesylate (DFO), or AST could activate healthy autophagic flux. In addition, in a dry eye mouse model, AST upregulated SLC7A11 and GPX4 and inhibited ferroptosis. To summarize, we found that AST can ameliorate DED by reinforcing the SLC7A11/GPX4 pathway, which mainly affects oxidative stress, autophagy, and ferroptosis processes."

The mechanisms underlying these disorders, as well as ways to prevent them, are an urgent task in biomedicine. We investigate the mechanism of the positive effect of AX on rat liver mitochondria after chronic alcohol administration and suggest the targets of its effects. In this work, we continued our studies of astaxanthin (AX) as a possible protector of mitochondria from the toxic effects of ethanol. METHODS: In our experiments, we used the Lieber-DeCarly model of chronic alcohol intoxication, which allows high-dose alcohol intake. Four groups of animals were used in the experiments: group 1 (control), group 2 (treated with AX), group 3 (treated with ethanol), and group 4 (treated with ethanol and AX together). Rat liver mitochondria (RLM) were isolated by the standard method modified in our laboratory. A multifunctional chamber with built-in electrodes was used to determine mitochondrial functions. Electrophoresis followed by Western blot analysis was used to detect mitochondrial proteins. Statistical significance was calculated using t-test Student-Newman- Keuls test. RESULTS: AX has been shown to have a positive effect on the functioning of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), the regulation of signaling pathways, as well as mitochondrial dynamics. It was found that AX is able to suppress the degenerative effect of alcohol on liver mitochondria. Targets for the protective action of AX in rat liver mitochondria (RLM) have been proposed. CONCLUSION: The discovered protective effect of AX on liver mitochondria during alcohol damage may contribute to the development of new strategies for the treatment of alcohol- induced damage.",

      "abstract": "The accumulation of misfolded proteins is a common pathological characteristic shared by many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The disruption of proteostasis triggers endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, during which the unfolded protein response (UPR) is initiated by the activation of protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). These three branches of UPR signals act in concert to reduce the levels of abnormal proteins and restore ER homeostasis. However, the overactivation of UPR impairs cell function and induces apoptosis, which has been implicated in neurodegeneration. Astaxanthin is a xanthophyll carotenoid which has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in both cell and animal models; however, its effects on ER stress and UPR induced by disrupted proteostasis remain unclear. In this study, the effects of astaxanthin on ER stress and cytotoxicity were investigated in N2a cells stably expressing the pro-aggregant tau repeat domain carrying FTDP-17 mutation ΔK280 (Tau4RDΔK280). The results demonstrated that astaxanthin significantly inhibited Tau4RDΔK280-induced loss of cell viability and apoptosis, attenuating Tau4RDΔK280-induced caspase-3 activation and decrease of Bcl-2. Further studies revealed that astaxanthin treatment alleviated Tau4RDΔK280-induced ER stress and suppressed the activation of PERK, IRE1 and ATF6 signaling pathways. These findings suggested that astaxanthin might inhibit Tau4RDΔK280-induced cytotoxicity by attenuating UPR and ER stress. In addition, astaxanthin treatment resulted in a great reduction in the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species and a significant decrease in calcium influx induced by Tau4RDΔK280, which also contributed to the protective effects of astaxanthin against Tau4RDΔK280-induced cytotoxicity.",

Moreover, potential differences in therapeutic activity caused by using different sources of astaxanthin, synthetic (ASYN) versus isolated from Blakeslea trispora (ASTAP), were evaluated using one-way ANOVA (Tukey-Kramer post hoc test). KXAN was the most effective in reducing plasma MMP-9 levels in monotherapy, significantly better than MTX, and in reducing hind paw swelling. The differences in the action of ASTAP and ASYN have been observed across various biometric, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative parameters. In combined therapy with MTX, the ASYN + MTX combination proved to be better. These findings, especially the significant anti-arthritic effect of KXAN and ASYN + MTX, could be the basis for further preclinical studies.",

      "abstract": "Methotrexate (MTX), an antimetabolite agent, is widely used for acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment, despite its association with significant organ dysfunction. Astaxanthin (AST) is a natural carotenoid which has recently been emerged as a promising anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory agent. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of astaxanthin and low-dose methotrexate co-treatment in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line. The expression of Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), Thymidylate synthase (TYMS), apoptotic, anti-apoptotic as well as inflammatory genes was investigated using qRT-PCR. Flow cytometry was performed for cell cycle quantitative evaluation. Clonogenic assay was used to assess NALM6 cells proliferation capacity following treatment with AST, MTX, and co-treatment. To compare the antioxidant property of each group, the ferric ion reducing anti-oxidant power assay was performed. A reduction in viability was observed in the presence of MTX, AST, and their combined treatment. Both AST alone and in combination with MTX caused cell cycle arrest and a reduction in the expression of DHFR and TYMS. While MTX, AST, and their combination could reduce STAT3 and BCL-XL gene expression, they could act as positive regulators for the expression of BAX and CASP3, TNFα, and IL6. AST and MTX co-treatment inhibited the colony formation ability. FRAP assay also revealed that AST and AST+MTX increased the antioxidant capacity. Our data suggests that AST can improve MTX treatment efficacy and their combination therapy can be considered as a promising strategy for the management of acute lymphoblastic leukemia."

      "abstract": "Astaxanthin biosynthesis in Haematococcus pluvialis is driven by energy. However, the effect of the flagella-mediated energy-consuming movement process on astaxanthin accumulation has not been well studied. In this study, the profiles of astaxanthin and NADPH contents in combination with the photosynthetic parameters with or without flagella enabled by pH shock were characterized. The results demonstrated that there was no significant alteration in cell morphology, with the exception of the loss of flagella observed in the pH shock treatment group. In contrast, the astaxanthin content in the flagella removal groups was 62.9%, 62.8% and 91.1% higher than that of the control at 4, 8 and 12 h, respectively. Simultaneously, the increased Y(II) and decreased Y(NO) suggest that cells lacking the flagellar movement process may allocate more energy towards astaxanthin biosynthesis. This finding was verified by NADPH analysis, which revealed higher levels in flagella removal cells. These results provide preliminary insights into the underlying mechanism of astaxanthin accumulation enabled by energy reassignment in movement-lacking cells."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Heart failure is a chronic and progressive disease where the heart muscle is unable to pump enough blood and oxygen to meet the body's needs. Oxidative stress and inflammation are key elements in the development and progression of heart failure. Astaxanthin, a carotenoid, has strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that may protect the cardiovascular system. A study will evaluate the effect of astaxanthin supplementation on inflammatory status, oxidative stress, lipid profile, uric acid levels, endothelial function, quality of life, and disease symptoms in people with heart failure. METHODS: The current study is a double-blind controlled randomized clinical trial for 8 weeks, in which people with heart failure were randomly assigned to two groups: intervention (one capsule containing 20 mg of astaxanthin per day, n = 40) and placebo (one capsule containing 20 mg of maltodextrin per day, n = 40) will be divided. At the beginning and end of the intervention, uric acid, lipid profile, oxidative stress indices, inflammatory markers, blood pressure, nitric oxide, and anthropometric factors will be measured, and questionnaires measuring quality of life, fatigue intensity, shortness of breath, and appetite will be completed. SPSS version 22 software will be used for statistical analysis. DISCUSSION: There is a growing global interest in natural and functional food products. This RCT contributes to the expanding body of research on the potential benefits of astaxanthin in heart failure patients, including its antioxidant, lipid-lowering, and anti-inflammatory effects.

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is related to pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory conditions generated by Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This study aimed to determine the effect of Astaxanthin (ASX), as carotenoid with potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, on serum inflammatory markers, apoptotic factors and ER stress-apoptotic genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of women with PCOS. This randomized, double-blind clinical trial included 56 PCOS patients aged 18-40. For 8 weeks, subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups: either 12 mg ASX (n = 28) or placebo (n = 28). Real-time PCR was used to quantify gene expression associated with ER stress-apoptosis in PCOS women's PBMCs. The levels of TNF-α, IL18, IL6 and CRP were determined by obtaining blood samples from all patients before and after the intervention using Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Also, the levels of active caspase-3 and caspase-8 were detected in the PBMC by ELISA kit. Furthermore, we evaluated the efficacy of ASX on disease symptoms. Following the 8-week intervention, ASX supplementation was able to reduce the expression of GRP78 (p = 0.051), CHOP (p = 0.008), XBP1 (p = 0.002), ATF4 (0.038), ATF6 (0.157) and DR5 (0.016) when compared to the placebo. However, this decrease was not statistically significant for ATF6 (p = 0.067) and marginally significant for GRP78 (p = 0.051). The levels of TNF-α (p = 0.009), IL-18 (p = 0.003), IL-6 (p = 0.013) and active caspase-3 (p = 0.012) were also statistically significant lower in the therapy group. However, there was no significant difference in CRP (p = 0.177) and caspase-8 (p = 0.491) levels between the treatment and control groups. In our study, ASX had no significant positive effect on BMI, hirsutism, hair loss and regularity of the menstrual cycle. It appears that ASX may benefit PCOS by changing the ER stress-apoptotic pathway and reducing serum inflammatory markers; however, additional research is required to determine this compound's potential relevance.",

      "abstract": "Vascular dementia (VaD) is a cognitive disorder characterized by a decline in cognitive function resulting from cerebrovascular disease. The hippocampus is particularly susceptible to ischemic insults, leading to memory deficits in VaD. Astaxanthin (AST) has shown potential therapeutic effects in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying its protective effects in VaD and against hippocampal neuronal death remain unclear. In this study, We used the bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) method to establish a chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) rat model of VaD and administered a gastric infusion of AST at 25 mg/kg per day for 4 weeks to explore its therapeutic effects. Memory impairments were assessed using Y-maze and Morris water maze tests. We also performed biochemical analyses to evaluate levels of hippocampal neuronal death and apoptosis-related proteins, as well as the impact of astaxanthin on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and oxidative stress. Our results demonstrated that AST significantly rescued memory impairments in VaD rats. Furthermore, astaxanthin treatment protected against hippocampal neuronal death and attenuated apoptosis. We also observed that AST modulated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, suggesting its involvement in promoting neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity. Additionally, AST exhibited antioxidant properties, mitigating oxidative stress in the hippocampus. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential therapeutic effects of AST in VaD. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying the actions of AST, this study highlights the importance of protecting hippocampal neurons and suggests potential targets for intervention in VaD. There are still some unanswered questions include long-term effects and optimal dosage of the use in human. Further research is warranted to fully understand the therapeutic potential of AST and its application in the clinical treatment of VaD.",

This study aimed to investigate the effects of ATX on podocytes in diabetic nephropathy and the underlying renal protective mechanism of ATX, which leads to pathological crosstalk with mesangial cells.Methods: In this study, diabetic rats treated with ATX exhibited reduced 24-h urinary protein excretion and decreased blood glucose and lipid levels compared to vehicle-treated rats. Glomerular mesangial matrix expansion and renal tubular epithelial cell injury were also attenuated in ATX-treated diabetic rats compared to control rats.Results: ATX treatment markedly reduced the α-SMA and collagen IV levels in the kidneys of diabetic rats. Additionally, ATX downregulated autophagy levels. In vitro, compared with normal glucose, high glucose inhibited LC3-II expression and increased p62 expression, whereas ATX treatment reversed these changes. ATX treatment also inhibited α-SMA and collagen IV expression in cultured podocytes. Secreted factors (vascular endothelial growth factor B and transforming growth factor-β) generated by high glucose-induced podocytes downregulated autophagy in human mesangial cells (HMCs); however, this downregulation was upregulated when podocytes were treated with ATX.Conclusions: The current study revealed that ATX attenuates diabetes-induced kidney injury likely through the upregulation of autophagic activity in podocytes and its antifibrotic effects. Crosstalk between podocytes and HMCs can cause renal injury in diabetes, but ATX treatment reversed this phenomenon.",

It is well known that AXT plays a role as a drug with antioxidant and antitumor properties. Furthermore, several studies have reported that the reagent shows anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Recently, it was found that AXT acts as a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) modulator. To investigate the effect of AXT on MCF-7 cells (a human breast cancer cell line), the cells were treated with various concentrations of AXT. The treatment induced the decrease in cell number in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, the Annexin V-positive cells were increased by the AXT treatment. These results indicated that apoptosis was induced in the tumor cells through the treatment of AXT. To elucidate the connection between apoptosis and p53, the levels of p53 and p21 proteins were assessed. Consequently, it was observed that the expression of p53 and p21 increased proportionally to the concentration of the AXT treatment. These findings suggest that the apoptosis of MCF-7 cells induced by AXT operates through a p53-dependent pathway, implying that AXT could potentially have a beneficial role in future breast cancer treatments. Thus, our results will provide a direction for future cancer challenges.",

Results showed both treatments under heat stress experienced reduced growth performance, while the group treated with astaxanthin showed a slightly lesser decline. Results further showed the astaxanthin treatment group significantly upregulated in the cytoprotective gene expression for HSF2, SOD2, GPX3, and TXN, as well as the upregulation of epithelial integrity genes LOX, CLDN1, and MUC2.

Therefore, ongoing research is crucial for fully understanding the extent of TBPH's neurotoxicity and for developing effective mitigation strategies. This study aims to investigate the potential neurotoxicity of TBPH on mouse neurobehavior and to evaluate the protective effects of the natural antioxidant astaxanthin (AST) against TBPH-induced neurotoxicity. The results indicate that exposure to TBPH can lead to a decline in learning and memory abilities and abnormal behaviors in mice, which may be associated with oxidative stress responses and apoptosis in the hippocampus. TBPH may disrupt the normal function of hippocampal neurons by activating the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway. Mice exposed to TBPH treated with AST showed improved learning and memory abilities in the Morris water maze (MWM) and Step-down test (SDT). AST, through its antioxidant action, was able to significantly reduce the increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels induced by TBPH, the increased expression of apoptosis markers, and the activation of the ERK1/2-FOS signaling pathway, alleviating TBPH-induced apoptosis in hippocampal neurons and improving neurobehavioral outcomes. These findings suggest that AST may alleviate the neurotoxicity of TBPH by modulating molecular events related to apoptosis and the ERK1/2-FOS signaling pathway. Thus, this study provides evidence for AST as a potential interventional strategy for the prevention or treatment of cognitive decline associated with environmental neurotoxicant exposure.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Astaxanthin (ASX) is a lipid-soluble keto-carotenoid with several biological effects. These effects may benefit polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients. Imbalanced apoptosis/anti-apoptosis signaling has been considered the major pathogenesis of PCOS. In a randomized clinical trial, we tested the impact of ASX on the apoptotic pathway in PCOS granulosa cells (GCs). The present study hypothesizes that ASX may improve apoptosis in PCOS patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This trial recruited patients with confirmed PCOS. A total of 58 patients were randomly assigned to take ASX (12 mg) or placebo for 8 weeks. Aspirated follicular fluid (FF) and blood samples were taken from both groups to measure BAX and BCL2 protein expression. Following FF aspiration, GCs from both groups were obtained; Real-Time PCR and Western blotting were used to evaluate the apoptotic pathway's gene and protein expression levels in GCs.BAXBCL2. RESULTS: In GCs analysis, ASX reduced DR5 gene and protein expression after 8 weeks compared to placebo(p<0.05). Also, Caspase8 (p>0.05) and BAX (p<0.05) gene expression declined, although the difference was not statistically significant for Caspase8. Besides,ASX treatment contributed to an elevated BCL2 gene expression in GCs(p<0.05). In FF and serum analysis, a statistically significant increase was found in BCL2 concentration in the ASX group (p<0.05). Moreover, a reduction in BAX level was confirmed in both FF and serum of the ASX group; however, this change was not significant in the serum (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: It seems that ASX consumption among women with PCOS improved serum and FF levels of apoptotic factors and modulated genes and protein expression of the apoptosis pathway in GCs. Nevertheless, further investigations are needed to reveal the potential role of this compound in PCOS treatment."

      "abstract": "Gastric ulcer disease remains one of the common medical burdens affecting millions worldwide due to its prevalent risk factors with the chronic usage of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs at the top, reportedly through the stimulation of oxidative stress and triggering of inflammatory and apoptotic cascades in the gastric mucosa. Astaxanthin, a dietary keto-carotenoid derived from marine organisms is gaining a wide interest as a nutraceutical for its pronounced antioxidant properties. Here, we aim to examine the potential modulatory role of astaxanthin on indomethacin-induced gastric ulceration in experimental mice. Twenty-four Swiss albino mice were randomly distributed into four groups: a control group, an indomethacin group, and two groups pre-treated with either omeprazole or astaxanthin. The gastric tissues were assessed using gross morphology, ulcer scoring, gastric juice acidity, as well as reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Histopathological examination and immunostaining for nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and caspase-3 levels were also employed. Indomethacin group tended to show a higher number of mucosal ulcerations relative to control and pre-treated groups. The indomethacin group also showed significantly lower GSH levels and higher MDA levels relative to control. Immunostaining of gastric tissue sections showed a higher reactivity to NF-﻿κB and caspase-3 in indomethacin group. Astaxanthin pre-treatment significantly elevated gastric juice pH, normalized GSH levels, and lowered the indomethacin-induced elevations in MDA, NF-﻿κB, and caspase-3 levels. These results indicate that astaxanthin exhibits a comparable protective effect to omeprazole, against indomethacin-induced gastric ulceration. This anti-ulcerogenic effect could be mediated through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic modulatory activities.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Facilitating the healing process of skin post-trauma is crucial for minimizing infection risks and reinstating normal tissue functionality. While past studies have established astaxanthin (ASX) as an effective compound in promoting wound healing, the precise mechanism of its action remains unclear. Consequently, the objective of this study was to explore the impact of ASX on the acute wound healing of rat skin by modulating macrophage polarization. METHODS: Eighteen male SD rats were randomly assigned to control, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and ASX groups. Acute skin wounds were induced in the rats, and the effects of different treatments on wound area and healing were assessed. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining was employed to detect histopathological changes in the skin, while Masson staining was utilized to observe collagen expression. Immunohistochemistry was conducted to identify clusters of differentiation (CD) 206 macrophages in the tissues. Furthermore, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the levels of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-4, and IL-13. The expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), arginase (Arg)-1, and mannose receptor C-type 1 (Mrc1) proteins in the injured skin of rats was assessed through Western blot analysis. RESULTS: On postoperative days 7 and 14, the ASX treatment demonstrated notable reductions in inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammatory cytokine expression when compared to the Control and DMSO groups. This was accompanied by evident improvements in the pathological changes in skin tissue, characterized by the regeneration of new epidermis, dermal repair, and increased thickness of granulation, contributing to enhanced scar formation. Furthermore, ASX therapy exhibited an upregulation in the expression levels of collagen I and collagen III, along with markers indicative of M2 macrophages. These findings collectively signify the accelerated progression of wound healing attributed to ASX intervention. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, these findings collectively indicate that ASX facilitates the healing of rat skin wounds by suppressing inflammatory responses and fostering M2 macrophage polarization. Consequently, ASX holds promise as a potentially effective drug for the treatment of skin wounds.",

      "abstract": "Worldwide, osteoarthritis (OA) is regarded as the most widespread, distressing, and limiting chronic disease that affects degenerative joints. Currently, there is no treatment available to modify the progression of OA. The pathogenesis of OA is significantly linked with oxidative stress and pyroptosis. Astaxanthin (Ast) is a natural ketocarotenoid pigment with potent antioxidant activity and is shown to effectively alleviate cartilage damage in OA. However, its bioavailability is greatly limited due to poor water solubility, high sensitivity to light, temperature, and pH. In this study, Ast-loaded tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs) or tFNA/Ast complexes (TAC) for Ast delivery are developed. Compared with free Ast and tFNA alone, TAC exhibits improved drug stability and cellular uptake. Most importantly, TAC effectively protects chondrocytes against oxidative stress-induced pyroptosis while promoting extracellular matrix anabolism by chondrocytes, and ultimately alleviates cartilage damage in a mouse destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) model. Thus, TAC holds great promise for the treatment of OA patients.",

DESIGN: Patients with PCOS were randomly divided into two groups. The intervention group received 6 mg AST, and the control group received placebo daily for 8 weeks. Blood samples were obtained from all patients before and after intervention and follicular fluid (FF) was collected during the ART procedure. Interleukin (IL) -6, IL-1β were evaluated from serum samples and FF and OS markers (malondialdehyde [MDA], catalase [CAT], superoxide dismutase [SOD], and reactive oxygen species [ROS]) were measured from FF. The groups were compared for ART outcomes as well. RESULTS: A significant decrease in IL-6 and IL-1β concentrations (both, P = < 0.01) serum levels was found following AST treatment. FF cytokine levels and OS markers did not differ significantly between the groups. Reproductive outcomes, including the number of oocytes retrieved (P = 0.01), the MII oocyte count (P = 0.007), oocyte maturity rate (MII %) (P = 0.02) and number of frozen embryos (P = 0.03) significantly improved after intervention. No significant differences were found in chemical, clinical and multiple pregnancies between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: AST pretreatment may modify inflammation and improve ART outcomes in PCOS infertile patients. Further investigations are recommended to verify these findings.",

It was found that the hybrid and sequential treatments of resveratrol (200 μmol) and catechol (100 μmol) had achieved the maximum astaxanthin content at 33.96 mg/L and 42.99 mg/L, respectively. Compared with the hybrid treatment, the physiological data of H. pluvialis using the sequential strategy revealed that the enhanced photosynthetic performance via the Calvin cycle by RuBisCO improved the biomass accumulation during the macrozooid stage; meanwhile, the excessive ROS production had occurred to enhance astaxanthin production with the help of NADPH overproduction during the hematocyst stage. Overall, this study provides improved knowledge of the impacts of phytohormones in improving biomass and astaxanthin of H. pluvialis, which shed valuable insights for advancing microalgae-based biorefinery."

In this study, a mouse model of AIH is established induced by concanavalin A (ConA). Mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) are used to analyze the potential role of ASX in regulating the immune microenvironment of AIH. ASX treatment effectively alleviated liver damage induced by ConA and downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines production in mice. Mass cytometry and scRNA-seq analyses revealed a significant increase in the number of CD8+ T cells following ASX treatment. Functional markers of CD8+ T cells, such as CD69, MHC II, and PD-1, are significantly downregulated. Additionally, specific CD8+ T cell subclusters (subclusters 4, 13, 24, and 27) are identified, each displaying distinct changes in marker gene expression after ASX treatment. This finding suggests a modulation of CD8+ T cell function by ASX. Finally, the key transcription factors for four subclusters of CD8+ T cells are predicted and constructed a cell-to-cell communication network based on receptor-ligand interactions probability. In conclusion, ASX holds the potential to ameliorate liver damage by regulating the number and function of CD8+ T cells.",

      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia is characterised by widespread chronic pain and is often accompanied by comorbidities such as sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression. Because it is often accompanied by many adverse symptoms and lack of effective treatment, it is important to search for the pathogenesis and treatment of fibromyalgia. Astaxanthin, a carotenoid pigment known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, has demonstrated effective analgesic effects in neuropathic pain. However, its impact on fibromyalgia remains unclear. Therefore, in this study, we constructed a mouse model of fibromyalgia and investigated the effect of astaxanthin on chronic pain and associated symptoms through multiple intragastrical injections. We conducted behavioural assessments to detect pain and depression-like states in mice, recorded electroencephalograms to monitor sleep stages, examined c-Fos activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, measured activation of spinal glial cells, and assessed levels of inflammatory factors in the brain and spinal cord, including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor- α(TNF-α).Additionally, we analysed the expression levels of IL-6, IL-10, NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3), Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD, and Caspase-1 proteins. The findings revealed that astaxanthin significantly ameliorated mechanical and thermal pain in mice with fibromyalgia and mitigated sleep disorders and depressive-like symptoms induced by pain. A potential mechanism underlying these effects is the anti-inflammatory action of astaxanthin, likely mediated through the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which could be one of the pathways through which astaxanthin alleviates fibromyalgia. In conclusion, our study suggests that astaxanthin holds promise as a potential analgesic medication for managing fibromyalgia and its associated symptoms.",

In this systematic review, studies evaluating the efficacy of astaxanthin against different neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, cerebrovascular diseases, and spinal cord injury are analyzed. Based on the current literature, astaxanthin shows potential biological activity in both in vitro and in vivo models. In addition, its preventive and therapeutic activities against the above-mentioned diseases have been emphasized in studies with different experimental designs. In contrast, none of the 59 studies reviewed reported any safety concerns or adverse health effects as a result of astaxanthin supplementation. The preventive or therapeutic role of astaxanthin may vary depending on the dosage and route of administration. Although there is a consensus in the literature regarding its effectiveness against the specified diseases, it is important to determine the safe intake levels of synthetic and natural forms and to determine the most effective forms for oral intake.",

GPX4 plays a major role in mediating astaxanthin nutritional intervention to reduce ROS and liver non-heme iron accumulation, which would contribute to the reduction of ferroptosis. Meanwhile, astaxanthin maintains the stability of transport receptors and protein macromolecules such as TMEM163, SLC7A11, SLC3A2, FPN1 and GLUT1 in the brain liver axis, promoting substance exchange and energy supply.

Astaxanthin (ATX) is a well-known antioxidant widely used for its anti-inflammatory and anti-aging properties. However, few studies have investigated the protective effects of ATX against PM2.5-induced senescence in HaCaT cells. In the present study, the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant enzymes were measured after treatment with PM2.5. The results revealed that PM2.5 generated excessive ROS and reduced the translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), subsequently reducing the expression of antioxidant enzymes. However, pretreatment with ATX reversed the ROS levels as well as the expression of antioxidant enzymes. In addition, ATX protected cells from PM2.5-induced DNA damage and rescued PM2.5-induced cell cycle arrest. The levels of senescence-associated phenotype markers, such as interleukin-1β, matrix metalloproteinases, and β-galactosidase, were increased by exposure to PM2.5, however these effects were reversed by ATX. After interfering with NRF2 mRNA expression and exposing cells to PM2.5, the levels of ROS and β-galactosidase were higher compared with siControl RNA cells exposed to PM2.5. However, ATX inhibited ROS and β-galactosidase levels in both the siControl RNA and the siNRF2 RNA groups. Thus, ATX protects HaCaT keratinocytes from PM2.5-induced senescence by partially inhibiting excessive ROS generation via the NRF2 signaling pathway."

The two salt stresses inhibited the cell growth by lowering photosynthetic abilities and raising ROS levels. During the 6-day treatment, the two salt stresses improved the levels of astaxanthin, precursors (β-carotene and zeaxanthin) and carotenoids, which might be caused by the raised ROS up-regulating expression of 7 related genes. At the same concentration, KCl stress showed stronger inducing effect on astaxanthin and its precursor production than NaCl stress, due to higher expression of related genes. Therefore, NaCl and KCl stresses have obvious ion differences on astaxanthin accumulation, of which KCl stress is more suitable for the high-value antioxidant production from microalgae.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Aggregation and misfolding of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau proteins, suggested to arise from post-translational modification processes, are thought to be the main cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Additionally, a plethora of evidence exists that links metabolic dysfunctions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and dyslipidemia to the pathogenesis of AD. We thus investigated the combinatory effect of T2D and human glutaminyl cyclase activity (pyroglutamylation), on the pathology of AD and whether astaxanthin (ASX) treatment ameliorates accompanying pathophysiological manifestations. METHODS: Male transgenic AD mice, APPxhQC, expressing human APP751 with the Swedish and the London mutation and human glutaminyl cyclase (hQC) enzyme and their non-transgenic (NTG) littermates were used. Both APPxhQC and NTG mice were allocated to 3 groups, control, T2D-control, and T2D-ASX. Mice were fed control or high fat diet ± ASX for 13 weeks starting at an age of 11-12 months. High fat diet fed mice were further treated with streptozocin for T2D induction. Effects of genotype, T2D induction, and ASX treatment were evaluated by analysing glycemic readouts, lipid concentration, Aβ deposition, hippocampus-dependent cognitive function and nutrient sensing using immunosorbent assay, ELISA-based assays, western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, and behavioral testing via Morris water maze (MWM), respectively. RESULTS: APPxhQC mice presented a higher glucose sensitivity compared to NTG mice. T2D-induced brain dysfunction was more severe in NTG compared to the APPxhQC mice. T2D induction impaired memory functions while increasing hepatic LC3B, ABCA1, and p65 levels in NTG mice. T2D induction resulted in a progressive shift of Aβ from the soluble to insoluble form in APPxhQC mice. ASX treatment reversed T2D-induced memory dysfunction in NTG mice and in parallel increased hepatic pAKT while decreasing p65 and increasing cerebral p-S6rp and p65 levels. ASX treatment reduced soluble Aβ38 and Aβ40 and insoluble Aβ40 levels in T2D-induced APPxhQC mice. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that T2D induction in APPxhQC mice poses additional risk for AD pathology as seen by increased Aβ deposition. Although ASX treatment reduced Aβ expression in T2D-induced APPxhQC mice and rescued T2D-induced memory impairment in NTG mice, ASX treatment alone may not be effective in cases of T2D comorbidity and AD.",

      "abstract": "The present study was undertaken to assess the ameliorative effect of dietary supplementation of astaxanthin in Sirohi goats under simulated heat stress conditions. Eighteen healthy female Sirohi goats were divided equally into three groups (n = 6): Heat-Stressed Control (HSC), Treatment 1 (T1), and Treatment 2 (T2). During the experiment, goats in the T1 group were supplemented with astaxanthin at the rate of 25 mg/animal/day, while those in the T2 group received supplementation of 50 mg/animal/day. The experiment was conducted for 42 days: 14 days of acclimatization period, next 21 days animals were exposed to 42ºC for 6 h from 09:00 h to 15:00 h and 7 days of recovery period. On a daily basis, we recorded the physiological responses of goats and collected environmental data at the experimental site. Blood samples were collected 0 and 14th days of acclimatization, on 1st, 6th, 11th, 16th and 21st day of heat exposure and on the 7th day of the recovery period. The rectal temperature and respiration rates of the treatment groups were lower than those of the HSC group during the exposure period. Heat stress in the supplemented groups was associated with reduced levels of hepatic enzymes such as AST and ALT. Serum urea, creatinine and albumin levels were significantly (P < 0.05) different between control and treatment groups. It was thus concluded that dietary inclusion of antioxidant astaxanthin can ameliorate induced thermal load as evident from changes in physio-biochemical parameters in the Sirohi goats, that was more prominent at 50 mg/ animal/day than 25 mg/ animal/day.",

Astaxanthin, an orange-red carotenoid present in marine organisms, has been the focus of this study to explore its impact and mechanism on osteoblast apoptosis induced by dexamethasone (Dex) and GIONFH. METHODS: In this experiment, bioinformatic prediction, molecular docking and dynamics simulation, cytotoxicity assay, osteogenic differentiation, qRT-PCR analysis, terminal uridine nickend labeling (TUNEL) assay, determination of intracellular ROS, mitochondrial function assay, immunofluorescence, GIONFH rat model construction, micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) scans were performed. RESULTS: Our research demonstrated that a low dose of astaxanthin was non-toxic to healthy osteoblasts and restored the osteogenic function of Dex-treated osteoblasts by reducing oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis. Furthermore, astaxanthin rescued the dysfunction in poor bone quality, bone metabolism and angiogenesis of GIONFH rats. The mechanism behind this involves astaxanthin counteracting Dex-induced osteogenic damage by activating the Nrf2 pathway. CONCLUSION: Astaxanthin shields osteoblasts from glucocorticoid-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction via Nrf2 pathway activation, making it a potential therapeutic agent for GIONFH treatment.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To investigate the fundamental mechanisms of the neuroprotective impact of Astaxanthin (AST) in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) induced by scopolamine. METHODS: This research constituted an in vivo animal study encompassing 36 adult male mice, divided into 6 groups: Control, 100 mg/kg AST, 2 mg/kg scopolamine (AD group), 100 mg/kg AST+2 mg/kg scopolamine, 3 mg/kg galantamine+2 mg/kg scopolamine, and 100 mg/kg AST+3 mg/kg galantamine+2 mg/kg scopolamine. After 14 days, the mice's short-term memory, hippocampus tissue, oxidative and inflammatory markers were evaluated. RESULTS: The AST demonstrated a beneficial influence on short-term memory and a reduction in acetylcholinesterase activity in the brain. It exhibited neuroprotective and anti-amyloidogenic properties, significantly decreased pro-inflammatory markers and oxidative stress, and reversed the decline of the Akt-1 and phosphorylated Akt pathway, a crucial regulator of abnormal tau. Furthermore, AST enhanced the effect of galantamine in reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that AST may offer therapeutic benefits against cognitive dysfunction in AD. This is attributed to its ability to reduce oxidative stress, control neuroinflammation, and enhance Akt-1 and pAkt levels, thereby underscoring its potential in AD treatment strategies.",

Atrazine (ATZ), a frequently used herbicide, whose degradation products are the cause for nephrosis and other oxidative stress associated diseases. This study was aimed to reveal the potential protective mechanism of astaxanthin against atrazine-induced nephrosis. Atrazine was orally given (250 mg/kg bw) to the mice along with astaxanthin (100 mg/kg bw) for 28 days. Serum biochemical indicators, oxidative stress biomarkers, ATPase activities, ion concentration, histomorphology, and various renal genes expression linked with apoptosis, Nrf2 signaling pathway, and aquaporins (AQPs) were assessed. It was found that serum creatinine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and MDA levels were significantly increased after the treatment of atrazine, whereas serum renal oxidative stress indicators like CAT, GSH, T-AOC, SOD decreased. Renal histopathology showed that atrazine significantly damaged renal tissues. The activities of Ca 2+-Mg 2+-ATPase were increased whereas Na +-K +-ATPase decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Moreover, results confirmed that the expression of AQPs, Nrf2, and apoptosis genes were also altered after atrazine administration. Interestingly, astaxanthin supplementation significantly (P < 0.05) improved atrazine-induced nephrotoxicity via decreasing SCr, BUN, oxidative stress, ionic homeostasis and reversing the changes in AQPs, Nrf2, and apoptosis gene expression. These findings collectively suggested that astaxanthin has strong potential ameliorative impact against atrazine induced nephrotoxicity."

      "abstract": "Astaxanthin is a keto-based carotenoid mainly obtained from marine organisms, like Haematococcus pluvialis (H. pluvialis). Previous studies indicated the protective effects of Astaxanthin and H. pluvialis on aging related oxidative injury in liver, while the potential mechanisms are largely unknown. In addition, H. pluvialis residue is a by-product after astaxanthin extraction, which is rarely studied and utilized. The present study aimed to compare the effects of astaxanthin, H. pluvialis and H. pluvialis residue on the oxidant injury of liver in D-galactose-induced aging mice and explore the potential mechanisms through gut-liver axis. The results showed that all the three supplements prevented D-galactose-induced tissue injury, oxidative stress and chronic inflammation in liver and improved liver function. Gut microbiota analysis indicated that astaxanthin notably increased fecal levels of Bacteroidetes, unclassified_f__ Lachnospiraceae, norank_f__Lachnospiraceae, norank_f__norank_o__Clostridia_UCG-014, Prevotellaceae_ UCG-001, unclassified_f__Prevotellaceae in D-galactose-fed mice (p < 0.05). Compared to aging mice, H. pluvialis group had higher fecal levels of norank_f__Lachnospiraceae and Lachnospiraceae_UCG-006 (p < 0.05). H. pluvialis residue group displayed higher relative levels of Bacteroidetes, Streptococcus, and Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group (p < 0.05). Moreover, the production of fecal microbial metabolites, like SCFAs and LPS was also differently restored by the three supplements. Overall, our results suggest astaxanthin, H. pluvialis and H. pluvialis residue could prevent aging related hepatic injury through gutliver axis and provide evidence for exploiting of H. pluvialis residue as a functional ingredient for the treatment of liver diseases. Future studies are needed to further clarify the effect and mechanism of dominant components of H. pluvialis residue on liver injury, which is expected to provide a reference for the high-value utilization of H. pluvialis resources.",
