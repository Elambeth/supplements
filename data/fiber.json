      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The concept of hybrid therapy as separation surgery, followed by stereotactic radiation therapy or stereotactic body radiation therapy, is becoming the new standard of care in the management of metastatic epidural spinal cord compressions (MESCCs). Nevertheless, this new concept remains a form of palliative treatment, and surgical efforts to minimize morbidity and prolong survival serve to maximize palliation. Such strategies include short-segment fixation with cement augmentation, described as 1 level above and below the index level of the MESCC (single vertebral body level). The use of carbon fiber-reinforced polyetheretherketone (CFRP) instrumentation has allowed precise contouring in radiation planning and earlier detection of tumor recurrence, while being biomechanically comparable to standard titanium instrumentation. Therefore, the authors wanted to explore the feasibility of short-segment cement-augmented CFRP instrumentation for patients with spinal metastasis requiring separation surgery. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted from April 2022 to May 2024. Inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) patients who had open separation surgery for MESCC, 2) with short-segment cement-augmented CFRP instrumentation (defined as 1 level above and below the index disease level), 3) who underwent postoperative radiation therapy, with 4) a minimum 6 months of survival. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean survival was 14.9 months, mean radiographic follow-up was 7.9 months, median estimated blood loss was 300 ml, and mean operative time was 214 minutes. There were no cement- or hardware-related complications. There were 3 cases of postoperative kyphosis, one of which was symptomatic, but all were managed nonoperatively. One patient required a reoperation for repair of a CSF leak. CONCLUSIONS: Short-segment cement-augmented fixation is a feasible strategy in open separation surgery for MESCC. This is the first clinical study to incorporate the use of CFRP instrumentation in such a surgical strategy. Additional studies with larger sample sizes and longer durations of follow-up would support both the durability and potential survival benefit over titanium instrumentation."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Metastatic spine disease significantly impacts the oncological population, often requiring surgical intervention to address spinal instability. Traditional constructs, including titanium-based long-segment instrumentation and short-segment cement augmentation, have been the mainstay in managing these patients. Carbon fiber-reinforced polyetheretherketone (CFR-PEEK) hardware and shorter-segment instrumentation have demonstrated benefits of improved surveillance, earlier recurrence detection, and shorter operative time. This study evaluated the long-term experience of a single center with CFR-PEEK constructs in patients with metastatic spine disease. It also investigated the clinical durability of short-segment constructs and evaluated the necessity of cement augmentation in maintaining construct stability. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center study included patients with metastatic disease to the spine who underwent surgical fixation using CFR-PEEK hardware between 2021 and 2024. Inclusion criteria required perioperative radiation therapy and a minimum of 6 months of radiographic follow-up. Patients were stratified into short-construct (n = 13) and long-construct (n = 7) groups based on the number of vertebral levels spanned. Subgroup analysis of cement-augmented versus nonaugmented short constructs was performed. Variables analyzed included preoperative scores (American Spinal Injury Association grade, Karnofsky Performance Scale score, Spine Instability Neoplastic Score, and epidural spinal cord compression grade), estimated blood loss, length of hospital stay, and postoperative outcomes. Radiographic failure and revision surgery rates were primary endpoints. Statistical analyses were conducted using nonparametric methods. RESULTS: At 14 months of mean follow-up time, no radiographic failures or revision surgeries were observed within the 20 patients included in this study. Patients in the long-construct group had more vertebral levels involved (2.00 vs 1.15, p = 0.024), lower preoperative Karnofsky Performance Scale scores (58.57 vs 76.15, p = 0.01), and more frequent use of mixed constructs with titanium rods (p = 0.007). Short constructs demonstrated equivalent durability without the routine need for cement augmentation. Within the short-construct cohort, cement augmentation was associated with longer hospital stays (8.8 vs 3.63 days, p = 0.008) but did not reduce failure rates. CONCLUSIONS: CFR-PEEK instrumentation demonstrates excellent durability and stability in metastatic spine disease, even in patients receiving perioperative radiation therapy. Short-segment instrumentation demonstrates comparable durability to long-segment constructs while reducing operative risks and hospitalization duration. While cement augmentation has traditionally been used to enhance construct strength, the findings in this study suggest that its routine use may not be necessary in short-segment constructs; however, larger studies are needed to better understand long-term outcomes, optimize construct selection, and identify factors influencing hardware failure in this high-risk population."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Carbon fiber-reinforced polyetheretherketone (CFR-PEEK) instrumentation is increasingly being used in patients with spine tumors as the body of literature supporting its benefit in local disease surveillance and radiation planning grows. Small single-institution experiences with short-term follow-up have yet to demonstrate issues with construct durability despite different biomechanical properties of CFR-PEEK compared to titanium. In this study the authors evaluated CFR-PEEK hardware failures in patients with surgically treated spine tumors who had long-term follow-up. METHODS: This is an IRB-approved retrospective cohort study of patients with spine tumors who underwent instrumented spinal fusion with CFR-PEEK or titanium instrumentation at a single tertiary care center. Inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) age > 18 years; 2) pedicle screw fixation with CFR-PEEK or titanium; and 3) minimum 6 months of follow-up. The surgical indication was reviewed and agreed upon at a multidisciplinary spine tumor board meeting. RESULTS: A total of 190 patients undergoing CFR-PEEK instrumentation were identified during the study period; 148 had at least a 6-month follow-up. Of those 148, the median follow-up was 13.7 months. In total, there were 861 CFR-PEEK pedicle screws, 266 CFR-PEEK spinal rods, and 15 CFR-PEEK corpectomy cages included in the study. Percutaneous CFR-PEEK instrumentation was performed in 13 cases. There were 6 (4.1%) CFR-PEEK cases of mechanical/hardware failure, with a median interval time to failure of 5.51 (range 2.74-9.38) months. There were no hardware-related complications in the 26 patients who received CFR-PEEK instrumentation and who had a > 24-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This institutional experience provides the largest cohort with long-term follow-up to evaluate CFR-PEEK-related instrumentation failure in patients with spine tumors. The rate of hardware failure among CFR-PEEK instrumented constructs was comparable to that in the current literature for titanium implants used in degenerative spine and spine oncology treatment. Importantly, there were no hardware failures noted among patients with extended long-term survival, reinforcing the durability of CFR-PEEK instrumentation."

      "abstract": "Dietary fiber is present in many food categories (fruits, cereals, vegetables, legumes), and is considered a beneficial component of adult and children's diets. It is now well-established that dietary intervention is the first line of treatment for childhood dyslipidemia, both as a curative intervention (Familial Hyperchylomicronemia Syndrome, Sitosterolemia) and as an appropriate lifestyle aimed at improving the lipid profile in dyslipidemia, which is associated with early atherosclerosis and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in adulthood (Familial Hypercholesterolemia, overweight- and obesity-related dyslipidemia). In this paper, we reviewed the main consensus documents to determine the current indications for its use in children and adolescents, and analyzed the few specific papers on the subject in the literature to assess how fiber is currently used in the treatment of pediatric dyslipidemia, what precautions should be taken, and what the main benefits of fiber are on the lipid profile and cardiovascular risk."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The pulp and paper industry is under increasing pressure to adopt sustainable solutions that address its substantial energy consumption and environmental impact. One of the most energy-intensive operations is the thermal drying, which presents significant opportunities for efficiency improvements. This study evaluates a cell-free mild enzyme pretreatment, utilizing a cocktail of cellulases and xylanases, combined with cationic starch, to enhance dewatering efficiency and improve paper strength utilizing bleached hardwood pulp fibers. Life cycle and economic analysis were also conducted to quantify the environmental impact and economic benefits, with a particular focus on direct greenhouse gas emissions. Enhanced water removal during pressing can significantly reduce energy consumption during thermal drying, facilitating the decarbonization of the paper industry. RESULTS: The cell-free enzyme pretreatment, applied with mild refining and cationic starch, achieved significant improvements in dewatering efficiency and paper strength. The treatment led to an 11% point increase in solids and a 25% improvement in tensile strength. Morphological analyses revealed no changes in fiber length and width; however, reductions in kink and curl indexes indicated enhanced fiber flexibility and bonding potential. Furthermore, the enzyme-starch combination decreased water retention value by 27%, including substantial reductions in bound and hard-to-remove water content. Environmental assessments estimated a 12% reduction in global warming potential (GWP), with the technology yielding net savings of $11.29 per air-dried ton of paper through reduced natural gas consumption. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the technical feasibility and economic viability of incorporating enzyme and cationic starch treatments into papermaking. The treatment improves paper quality while reducing energy consumption, costs, and carbon emissions. These findings support the broader adoption of enzyme-based innovations for sustainable manufacturing, aligning with decarbonization goals and industry demands for greater efficiency. The results highlight a promising avenue for achieving significant environmental and economic benefits in the pulp and paper sector."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Magnetic nanoparticles are key components of air pollution. The combustion of diesel engine fuels, especially with ferrocene doping to reduce emissions, may increase exposure to these particles and related health risks. This study aimed to reveal the generation and characterization of ferrocene-derived magnetic particles (FMP) in ferrocene-doped diesel exhaust, and to investigate its toxicities and associated mechanisms in an avian model. METHODS: FMP was observed in ferrocene-doped diesel exhaust particles, and extracted with neodymium magnets. Extracted FMP was characterized, and exposed to hatchling chickens via aerosol inhalation. Pulmonary toxicities were assessed with pathological and molecular methods. Associated mechanisms were investigated with RNA-seq, in vitro cell culture, and in vivo gene silencing. RESULTS: FMP was characterized to be fibrous, magnetic iron-containing carbon particles. Extracted FMP could directly induce pulmonary toxicity. Mechanistic investigations revealed molecular mechanism associated with ferroptosis via Bach1, SAT1 and polyamines depletion, and further confirmed with ferroptosis inhibitor treatment, Bach1 inhibitor treatment, supplementation of polyamines or SAT1 silencing. CONCLUSIONS: Ferrocene doping could result in formation of magnetic particles in diesel exhaust. For the first time, magnetic fiber-like particles were extracted from ferrocene-doped DE particles, which is a potential source of magnetic particles in air pollution. To better balance emission control and health effects, further investigations are necessary.",

      "abstract": "The contribution of dissolved phosphorus (P) from tile drain systems in agricultural lands is significant, leading to water impairment and promoting algae bloom development in water bodies. Hence, there is an urgent need for sustainable and efficient technology, such as absorbent material, that can effectively remove P at low concentrations in these systems. This study aimed to evaluate fiber extraction from corn leaves and its potential for reducing dissolved P. Corn fibers were extracted from corn leaves using alkali treatment by varying the concentration of sodium hydroxide (5-15%w/w), extraction temperature (85-95°C), and time (60-120 min Results of the alkali extraction showed that the highest fiber recovery of 45.18 ± 0.39% g g-1 was achieved at 10% NaOH at 85°C for 60 min condition. To enhance the phosphorus adsorption capacity of the extracted corn fibers, kaolinite clay (0-30% w/w) and calcium carbonate (0-50% w/w) were incorporated into the leaf fiber. Adsorption tests revealed that corn leaf fiber alone reduced phosphate concentration by 8.75 ± 1.49% within 60 minutes. However, when enhanced with 30% w/w kaolinite clay and 35% w/w calcium carbonate, the phosphate concentration in the solution decreased by 79.40 ± 11.90%. Energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence analysis confirmed the presence of phosphorus in the enhanced adsorbent material following treatment. This study demonstrates the potential of enhancing agricultural wastes like corn leaf fiber as a low-cost alternative for phosphorus removal in agricultural tile drain systems that can later disposed of as fertilizer in a circular economy scheme. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Corn leaf fiber, extracted using alkali treatment, shows potential as a sustainable, low-cost adsorbent material for phosphorus removal Enhancing corn leaf fiber with kaolinite clay and calcium carbonate significantly improves phosphate reduction Converting agricultural waste like corn leaf as adsorbent material can help manage phosphorus levels in agricultural tile drains.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To characterize the clinical and multimodal imaging features of central bouquet hemorrhage (CBH) with Henle fiber layer (HFL) involvement in highly myopic eyes, and to investigate the relationships between hemorrhage characteristics, reabsorption time, and visual outcomes. METHODS: Multicenter, retrospective analysis of highly myopic eyes with CBH involving the HFL, confirmed by optical coherence tomography (OCT). RESULTS: Eighteen eyes from 18 subjects were included for analysis. The mean age of the cohort was 39 ± 13.7 years (range: 17-69) and 61% of subjects were female. Mean refractive error was -14.8 ± 3.14 diopters (range: -9 D to -22 D). All eyes demonstrated a combined CBH with HFL component, while a subretinal component was present in 83.3% of cases. Myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) was excluded in all eyes using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) or dye-based angiography (fluorescein or indocyanine green). No correlation was observed between hemorrhage size and visual outcomes or reabsorption time. Hemorrhage cleared after a mean of 2.63 months, and the radial HFL hemorrhage component resolved first. All eyes showed improvement in visual acuity from baseline. Persistent OCT alternations after resolution of hemorrhage included ellipsoid zone disruption (88.9%) and hyperreflective changes in HFL (77.8%). Anti-VEGF injections were administered to 6 eyes (33.3%) and did not correlate with a significant visual or anatomical benefit. CONCLUSION: CBH with HFL involvement in high myopia was associated with significantly improved visual outcomes from baseline but structural alterations can persist after clinical resolution. The size of the hemorrhage did not correlate with resorption time, and anti-VEGF treatment did not affect outcome. These findings provide new insights into the natural history and management of nonneovascular CBH in highly myopic eyes."

For the goal of improving impact strength further, layered carbon fiber (CF) reinforcement has been added between PC sheets by hot pressing at 6.0 MPa and 537 K for 8 min. An addition of cross-weave CF layer reinforcement to PC increased Charpy impact value, auc of the untreated [PC]4[CF]3 composite over that of untreated PC resin reported at all accumulative probabilities, Pf. At medial-Pf of 0.50, auc was increased 3.13 times (213%), while statistically lowest impact value as at Pf = 0 calculated by 3-parameter Weibull equation was boosted 2.64 times (164%). To optimize auc, effect of homogeneous electron beam irradiation (HLEBI) treatment of 43.2, 129, 216, 302, or 432 kGy at 170 kV acceleration voltage to the CF plies before assembly with PC then hot press was also investigated. The 216 kGy HLEBI dose appears to be optimum, raising as at Pf = 0 about 6.5% over that of untreated [PC]4[CF]3 and agrees with a previous study that showed 216 kGy to be optimum for static 3-point bending strength, when quality can be controlled. Electron spin resonance (ESR) data confirms 216 kGy HLEBI generates strong peaks in CF and PC indicating dangling bond (DB) generation. Bending strength increase was higher than that of impact due to lower test velocity and higher deformation area spreading along specimen length, allowing more DBs to take on the load. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data of CF top ~10 nm surface layer in the sizing confirms C-O-H, C-H, and C-O peak height from 216 kGy exhibited little or no change compared with untreated. However, 432 kGy increased the peak heights indicating enhanced adhesion to PC. However, 432 kGy degraded as at Pf = 0 of the [PC]4[CF]3, and is reported to decrease impact strength of PC itself by excess dangling bond formation. Thus, the 432 kGy created increased PC/CF adhesion, but degraded the PC resin. Therefore, 216 kGy of 170 kV-HLEBI appeared to be a well-balanced condition between the PC-cohesive force and PC/CF interface adhesive force when fabricating [PC]4[CF]3."

Compared to single enzymatic hydrolysis, the synergetic modification was more effective in promoting the soluble DF (SDF) ratio (increased from 10.68% to 32.67%), functional properties, and prebiotic activities of BBDF and decreasing the insoluble DF (IDF) content. Under 0.6% (w/w) cellulase and xylanase with mild extrusion conditions (40-80 °C), the modified BBDF exhibited the highest capacities for glucose and cholesterol adsorption. FTIR and XRD experiments indicated that the enzymatic extrusion destroyed the intermolecular interactions of BBDF. Furthermore, enzymatically extruded BBDFs showed 2.2-fold higher short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) yields during in vitro fecal fermentation (total SCFAs: 87.8 mM vs. 40.0 mM in control), with butyrate production reaching 2.5 mM (+76.3%), among which the mildly extruded BBDFs exhibited superior prebiotic effects."

      "abstract": "Objective: Prolonged microgravity environments impair skeletal muscle homeostasis by triggering fiber-type transitions and metabolic dysregulation. Although exercise and nutritional interventions may alleviate disuse atrophy, their synergistic effects under microgravity conditions remain poorly characterized. This study investigated the effects of an 8-week ketogenic diet combined with aerobic exercise in hindlimb-unloaded mice on muscle fiber remodeling and metabolic adaptation. Methods: Seven-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into six groups: normal diet control (NC), normal diet with hindlimb unloading (NH), normal diet with hindlimb unloading and exercise (NHE), ketogenic diet control (KC), ketogenic diet with hindlimb unloading (KH), and ketogenic diet with hindlimb unloading and exercise (KHE). During the last two weeks of intervention, hindlimb unloading was applied to simulate microgravity. Aerobic exercise groups performed moderate-intensity treadmill running (12 m/min, 60 min/day, and 6 days/week) for 8 weeks. Body weight, blood ketone, and glucose levels were measured weekly. Post-intervention assessments included the respiratory exchange ratio (RER), exhaustive exercise performance tests, and biochemical analyses of blood metabolic parameters. The skeletal muscle fiber-type composition was evaluated via immunofluorescence staining, lipid deposition was assessed using Oil Red O staining, glycogen content was analyzed by Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, and gene expression was quantified using quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Results: Hindlimb unloading significantly decreased body weight, induced muscle atrophy, and reduced exercise endurance in mice. However, the combination of KD and aerobic exercise significantly attenuated these adverse effects, as evidenced by increased proportions of oxidative muscle fibers (MyHC-I) and decreased proportions of glycolytic fibers (MyHC-IIb). Additionally, this combined intervention upregulated the expression of lipid metabolism-associated genes, including CPT-1b, HADH, PGC-1α, and FGF21, enhancing lipid metabolism and ketone utilization. These metabolic adaptations corresponded with improved exercise performance, demonstrated by the increased time to exhaustion in the KHE group compared to other hindlimb unloading groups. Conclusions: The combination of a ketogenic diet and aerobic exercise effectively ameliorates simulated microgravity-induced skeletal muscle atrophy and endurance impairment, primarily by promoting a fiber-type transition from MyHC-IIb to MyHC-I and enhancing lipid metabolism gene expression (CPT-1b, HADH, and PGC-1α). These findings underscore the potential therapeutic value of combined dietary and exercise interventions for mitigating muscle atrophy under simulated microgravity conditions."

      "abstract": "This study examines the effects of natural organic matter (NOM) and dissolved solids on fluoride (F-) retention in polyelectrolyte multilayer-based hollow-fiber nanofiltration membranes (dNF40). Lab-scale filtration experiments were conducted under varying operating conditions (initial salt concentration, NOM concentration, permeate flux, crossflow velocity, and recovery rate). dNF40 membranes exhibited F- retention above 70% ± 1.2 in the absence of NOM and competing ions. However, when filtering synthetic model water (SMW) designed to simulate groundwater contaminated with high total dissolved solids (TDSs) and NOM, F- retention decreased to approximately 60% ± 0.7, which was generally attributed to ion competition. Furthermore, despite limited declines in normalized permeability, the addition of NOM to SMW notably deceased F- retention in the steady state to~20% due to fouling effects. The facilitated transport of the divalent cations Ca2+ and Mg2+ could be observed, as they accumulated in the organic fouling layer. While SO42- retention remained relatively stable, the retention of monovalent anions (NO3-, Cl-, and F-) decreased substantially due to drag effects. Na+ retention improved slightly to maintain electroneutrality. Feed salinity was shown to significantly affect separation efficiency, with PEC layers undergoing swelling and certain structural changes as the ionic strength increased. During batch filtration experiments at varying recovery rates, the retention of monovalent anions further decreased, with F- retention reducing to just ~10% at a 90% recovery rate. This study provides valuable insights into better understanding and optimizing the performance of PEC-based NF membranes across diverse water treatment scenarios."

      "abstract": "Oily wastewater pollution is increasing globally. Conventional treatment methods often fail due to inefficiency and secondary contamination. Therefore, developing advanced membrane separation technologies is crucial. While membrane separation technology holds promise as a solution, its widespread applicability necessitates overcoming significant obstacles related to corrosion resistance, alkali resistance, and the prevention of membrane fouling. This study presents a novel and highly efficient approach for oil-water separation, employing bioinspired, nanoporous metal-organic framework-modified basalt fiber fabrics (BFF). The integration of UiO-66-NH2, renowned for its high porosity and tunable functionalities, with a chitosan-dopamine (CS-DA) layer on BFFs creates a multifunctional membrane with enhanced hydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity. This bioinspired design (refers to engineering solutions that mimic natural structures or mechanisms to improve performance and efficiency), drawing inspiration from the structure and function of natural materials, results in superior oil-water separation performance, demonstrating excellent flux and oil rejection rates. The UiO-66-NH2 effectively captures oil droplets due to its high porosity, while the CS-DA layer facilitates water permeability and promotes surface stability. Furthermore, the composite membrane exhibits exceptional stability and reusability, positioning it as a promising candidate for efficient and sustainable oil-water separation applications. This research showcases the potential of bioinspired design principles for developing innovative solutions to pressing environmental challenges."

      "abstract": "Chemical recycling methods for post-consumer textile waste are effective for sustainable textile waste management. However, recycling synthetic and blended (cotton and synthetic) textiles can contribute to the release of microplastic fibers (MPFs) into the environment. This study investigated MPF release across different stages of two chemical recycling approaches, acid and alkaline hydrolysis, of polyester/cotton-blended textiles. Recycling involves various stages, including dye removal, treatment stage, and product. In the treatment stage, acid hydrolysis breaks down cotton into cellulose, leaving the polyester (PET) intact, whereas alkaline hydrolysis degrades PET, allowing cotton recovery. Across all stages, dye removal generated the highest MPF count, averaging nearly 10,055 MPFs g-1 of textile waste. Statistical analysis confirmed that the recycling approach significantly affected MPF release (p < 0.05), whereas the fabric type did not (p > 0.05). Alkaline hydrolysis reduced MPF release during the treatment stage by 87.55% compared to acid hydrolysis, indicating that recovering cotton and chemically degrading PET can significantly minimize MPF emissions during recycling. Ridge regression analysis identified the reaction conditions as key factors in MPF fragmentation, with blend ratios influencing the number of released MPFs. Surface characterization revealed treatment-induced fiber alterations, raising concerns regarding MPF emissions throughout the process. These findings highlight the textile recycling industries can be a source of MPF release into the environment, but recovering PET through degradation or dissolution can help minimize this impact of the treatment stage."

This research thoroughly examines the effects of carbonization temperature and duration on both mechanical properties and thermal transmission characteristics of alkali-activated cement-based composites, while conducting comparative analyses of different surface modification strategies for performance enhancement in stalk-reinforced systems. Experimental findings demonstrate that surface carbonization under standard curing conditions outperforms NaOH immersion treatment, with the resultant mortar exhibiting impressive mechanical properties surpassing those of untreated stalk composites. Notably, this composite material simultaneously achieves enhanced thermal insulation performance, manifesting a thermal conductivity coefficient of 0.2373 W/m2 K. Furthermore, a machine learning framework was developed to model the relationship between modified stalk microstructure and composite mechanical properties, enabling accurate prediction of material performance."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the impact of 1070 nm Ytterbium Fiber Laser (YFL) on the shear bond strength of lithium disilicate ceramics to enamel. METHODS: Fifty-four freshly extracted bovine teeth were embedded in acrylic resin, with labial surfaces exposed. The teeth underwent etching with phosphoric acid, followed by the application of bond resin. Ceramic samples of 0.5 mm, 1 mm, and 1.5 mm thickness were obtained from lithium disilicate CAD blocks using a precision cutting tool. Samples were divided into two subgroups according to surface treatment method: one group was treated with 4.5% hydrofluoric acid for 20 s, while the other was treated with a 20 W average power YFL. One sample from each subgroup underwent SEM analysis; the remaining samples were cemented to prepared bovine teeth using composite resin cement. Color measurements were performed before and after surface treatments. Shear bond strength was evaluated using a universal testing machine with a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. Fracture analyses were conducted using a stereomicroscope. Statistical analyses were performed using two-way ANOVA and two-way ANOSIM. RESULTS: According to the two-way ANOVA results, the ΔE00 values were significantly higher in all thickness groups treated with YFL than in those subjected to acid treatment. Two-way ANOSIM revealed that neither sample thickness nor surface treatment had a statistically significant effect on shear bond strength. SEM analysis revealed micro-roughness in the acid-treated samples and mini-laser spots in the laser-treated groups, and no microfractures or cracks detected in any of the groups. CONCLUSION: The shear bond strengths of lithium disilicate ceramics, whether treated with YFL or hydrofluoric acid, were found to be comparable. These findings suggest the potential utility of 1070 nm YFL for ceramic etching, supporting the need for further investigation in dental applications.",

Soybean residue is rich in insoluble dietary fiber, which is known to have a positive effect on ulcerative colitis.

This study induced CUC using 2 % dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and conducted a three-phase (9-week) intervention experiment. The study showed that long-term consumption of HPSIDF can regulate the level of inflammatory factors in mice and relieve damage to intestinal tissue. In addition, long-term intake of HPSIDF inhibited the degradation of Lactobacillus intestinalis and promoted the proliferation of Oscillospira and the production of beneficial substances such as Agmatine and Betaine, which played an important role in the maintenance of intestinal bacterial flora and the improvement of the internal environment. This study clarified that long-term intake of HPSIDF not only changes the intestinal self-properties but also promotes the proliferation of beneficial flora and metabolites, providing a solution strategy for the high-value utilization of okara.",

Using Propensity Score Matching (PSM) to control confounders, it also examines the impact of oral levodopa on neuropathy incidence. METHODS: 117 PD patients were recruited from Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital. Detailed demographic and clinical data were systematically collected, both large and small fiber nerve functions were evaluated. Based on the results of the peripheral nerve assessments, patients were categorized into different groups to analyze the risk factors associated with different types of peripheral damage. PSM was utilized to control potential confounding variables (such as age, disease duration), to examinate the impact of oral levodopa on neuropathy. RESULTS: 55.56 % of the 117 PD patient exhibited peripheral neuropathy (PD-PN), including 22 (18.8 %) with large fiber damage, 29 (24.79 %) with small fiber damage, and 14 (11.97 %) exhibiting both large and small fiber damage. Higher UPDRSIII scores (OR 1.048, 95 %CI 1.015-1.082, p = 0.004) and advanced age (OR 1.068, 95 %CI 1.007-1.133, p = 0.029) were independent risk factors for peripheral neuropathy. There was no significant difference in the incidence of peripheral neuropathy between PD patients receiving oral levodopa treatment and those not receiving. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that both large fiber and small fiber neuropathy are prevalent among PD patients. Higher UPDRSIII scores and advanced age are independent risk factors for different types of neuropathies. It is important to screening for peripheral neuropathy in PD patients."

HPH diminished the particle size of CIDF (859.90 nm to 232.80 nm) and increased the total surface area and gap ratio. HPH enhanced the water and oil holding capacities of CIDF from 6.01 to 10.33 g/g and from 6.52 to 9.87 g/g, respectively. CIDF markedly inhibited PL activity by up to 72.51 % (p < 0.05), with the inhibition rate of PL was significantly higher in HPH-modified CIDF than in unmodified CIDF. The exposure of CIDF's hydroxyl groups due to the HPH treatment directly affected the degree of binding of CIDF to PL. CIDF reduces PL activity through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with its aromatic amino acid residues."

The first PVA hydrogel layer was covalently bonded to N-β-(aminoethyl)-γ-aminopropyl trimethoxysilane (AEAPTS)-grafted PTFE via a glutaraldehyde (GA)-induced Schiff base reaction and aldol condensation, respectively, while the second PIC hydrogel layer was strongly anchored on PVA through hydrogen bonding and topological entanglements.

Results revealed that cardiac fibrosis and heart failure were notably improved in the AHD mice receiving high-fiber or acetate diets. Transcriptomic analyses indicated that dietary interventions modulated the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and the TGF-β signaling pathway. Additionally, 16S rRNA sequencing showed that the high-fiber diet and acetate altered gut microbiota composition, enhancing the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Akkermansia muciniphila, Lactobacillus intestinalis, and Bacteroides acidifaciens. These microbes exhibited positive correlations with genes related to fat metabolism and TGF-β signaling, suggesting a potential mechanism for gut microbiota's role in AHD pathology. ROC analysis identified these bacteria as promising biomarkers for AHD detection.

However, the impact of the MDP on the fecal metabolome in ulcerative colitis (UC) remains unclear. We characterized the fecal metabolome of patients with UC with high adherence to the MDP compared to the Canadian habitual diet (CHD). Furthermore, we explored potential differences in the fecal metabolome between dietary responders and nonresponders to the MDP. METHODS: Utilizing untargeted metabolomics on a subset of fecal samples obtained from a randomized controlled trial, adult patients with quiescent UC underwent a 12-week intervention following either the MDP (n = 8) or CHD (n = 8). Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was employed to profile endogenous fecal metabolites, while 16S amplicon sequencing was utilized to profile the fecal microbiota. RESULTS: A total of 701 human metabolites were detected, with 35 exhibiting significant differential expression between the MDP and CHD groups. Noteworthy, folate biosynthesis, sphingolipid biosynthesis, and steroid biosynthesis were identified as major pathways affected. Moreover, microbial analysis showed that individuals with increased levels of the class Bacteroidia (Bacteroides vulgatus [B. vulgatus], B. uniformis, and B. acidifaciens) in their stool at baseline were more likely to respond to the MDP. CONCLUSION: High adherence to an MDP is associated with beneficial metabolite changes associated with reducing inflammation in UC. In addition, fiber-degrading microbes abundant before dietary intervention played a role in the responsiveness to the MDP. This work lays the groundwork for developing a metabolic signature associated with the MDP to develop personalized nutrition strategies for UC prevention and treatment.

      "abstract": "Prolonged hospital waiting times are linked with increased patient mortality and cause additional financial burdens on institutions. Efficient point-of-care diagnosis would help alleviate this, but is hampered by a lack of cost-effective devices capable of rapid, in situ, wide ranging analyte detection. Lab-on-fiber technology provides an answer allowing for diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring in situ with real time feedback. Here, a device is demonstrated that harnesses motor-protein-driven-microtubule molecular detection assays to optical fibers. By developing a new method for microscope-free microtubule gliding speed determination, proof of concept is demonstrated in the detection of Monomeric Streptavidin and Neutravidin, which initiate a decrease in speed in biotinylated microtubules as well as bundling in the latter case. Utilizing antibody functionalizsed microtubules label-free and microscope-free detection of the heart attack marker Creatine Kinase-MB, as well secondary antibodies in nm concentration is demonstrated. This detector has the potential to be used in situ, providing rapid, low-cost, multiplex analyte screening and detection."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Weaning stress adversely affects piglet growth and development, thereby reducing the economic efficiency of pig farming operations. Furthermore, pig feces are a major source of environmental pollution, underscoring the need for effective strategies to mitigate fecal output at its source. METHODS: This study investigated the effects of dietary supplementation with fermented bamboo fiber (FBF) on growth performance, intestinal barrier integrity, gut microbiota composition, and fecal pollutant levels in weaned piglets. A total of 144 Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire piglets, weaned at 21 days of age, were randomly assigned to 4 groups, with six replicates per group and 6 piglets per replicate. The control group (CON) received a basal diet, while the three treatment groups were fed the basal diet supplemented with 1, 1.5, and 2% FBF, respectively. The trial lasted 30 days. RESULTS: The findings revealed that FBF supplementation fortified the intestinal barrier, modulated colonic microbial communities, and decreased fecal pollutant levels. Among the treatment groups, supplementation with 1.5% FBF produced the most significant improvements in piglets' growth performance and intestinal barrier function, as well as the strongest microbial interactions and the greatest reduction in fecal pollutants. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that FBF supplementation can alleviate weaning stress and mitigate the environmental impact of pig feces, with 1.5% identified as the optimal supplementation level."

      "abstract": "Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has transformed cancer treatment, but success rates remain low in most cancers. Recent research suggest that dietary fiber enhances ICB response in melanoma patients and murine preclinical models through microbiome-dependent mechanisms. Yet, the robustness of this effect across cancer types and dietary contexts remains unclear. Specifically, prior literature compared grain-based chow (high fiber) to low-fiber purified diet, but these diets differ also on other dimensions including phytochemicals. Here we investigated, in mice fed grain-based chow or purified diets with differing quantities of isolated fibers (cellulose and inulin), metabolite levels and ICB activity in multiple tumor models. The blood and fecal metabolome were relatively similar between mice fed high- and low-fiber purified diets, but differed massively between mice fed purified diets or chow, identifying the factor as diet type, independent of fiber. Tumor growth studies in three implantable and two spontaneous genetically engineered tumor models revealed that fiber has a weaker impact on ICB (anti-PD-1) efficacy than previously reported. In some models, dietary modulation impacted ICB activity, but not in a consistent direction across models. In none of the models did we observe the pattern expected if fiber controlled ICB efficacy: strong efficacy in both chow and high-fiber purified diet but low efficacy in low-fiber purified diet. Thus, dietary fiber appears to have limited or inconsistent effect on ICB efficacy in mouse models, and other dietary factors that correlate with fiber intake may underlie the clinical correlations between fiber consumption and immunotherapy outcomes."

A novel carbonaceous, highly crystalline, mesoporous cellulose-nanocrystal (GOF@n-CL) was extracted from Grewia Optiva fiber (GOF) via 40 % H2SO4 hydrolysis and successfully applied for adsorptive removal of some pharmaceuticals (Diclofenac, Ciprofloxacin, Tetracycline, Ofloxacin, Norflox-TZ) from wastewater. While 13C NMR and FTIR spectral data confirmed the sanctity of cellulosic structure, XRD revealed cellulose-I structure having high crystallinity of 77.4 % in the fabricated GOF@n-CL. TEM analysis revealed a networked porous structure due to agglomeration of nearly spherical shaped GOF@n-CL with SAED confirming its poly-crystalline nature. Batch studies showed 96 % tetracycline (TTC) removals by GOF@n-CL and isotherm studies reflected its binding affinity was onto the heterogeneous surface. Physisorption binding mechanism via the involvement of pore diffusion, hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions was indicated from kinetics and from FTIR studies. The efficacy of the GOF@n-CL was further demonstrated by high removals of ciprofloxacin (81 %), diclofenac (46 %), ofloxacin (78 %) (under single adsorbate system) and of norflox-TZ (norfloxacin-48 %; trinidazole-35 %; dual adsorbate system).

Here, we report an ultrasensitive, rapid, and low-cost method for detection of the most popular sepsis biomarker, procalcitonin (PCT), based on a split aptamer-based fiber optic nanogold-linked sorbent assay. After successful development of a novel aptamer for PCT by SELEX, a pair of split aptamer fragments from the parent aptamer was predicted through molecular interaction simulation via free webservers. Then one fragment (AptF1) is modified on a sensor fiber and the other fragment (AptF2) is conjugated to a gold nanoparticle (AuNP@AptF2). The interactions among PCT and the two aptamer fragments lead to the formation of a AuNP@AptF2-PCT-AptF1 sandwich-like nanocomplex on the fiber core surface, leading to strong nanoplasmonic absorption near the fiber core surface. This method provides a linear response ranging from 500 fg/mL to 5.0 ng/mL and a detection limit of 50 fg/mL (3.9 fM). The method had been validated against the clinical accepted electrochemiluminescence immunoassay using clinical samples and very good correlation between the results by both methods was found. Therefore, this method offers a potential for point-of-care diagnosis of sepsis."

A major factor contributing to this difference is the optical scattering caused by rough interfaces between the fiber core and cladding. We fabricate an optical fiber preform using the extrusion-assisted hot-diffusion method. The quality of the core-cladding interface and diffusion was characterized using scanning electron microscope (SEM)-energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and Raman spectroscopy. A diffusion depth of 40.5 μm was achieved in a hot-pressing environment at 320°C. The defect and diffusion layers were modeled to understand the impact of hot-diffusion on light scattering loss in the fiber. The chalcogenide fibers were drawn and analyzed, and the results confirmed that the hot-diffusion treatment was effective in reducing the loss of the fiber. The average fiber loss was reduced by 58%, from 4.5 to 1.88 dB/m in the 5-6 μm range, with a minimum loss of 0.68 dB/m at 2.64 μm."

Despite the increase in CFR-PEEK application in the literature, technical guides or considerations in terms of CFR-PEEK usage in MSTS are currently unavailable. This study aimed to highlight various important technical considerations and potential pitfalls for surgeons when applying CFR-PEEK instrumentation in MSTS. This narrative review was conducted using PubMed, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, The Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases through December 31, 2024. This review included all studies related to CFR-PEEK instrumentation in MSTS. The vast personal experiences of the senior authors with the CFR-PEEK instrumentation circumstantiated the concepts emphasized in this paper. This review included 36 articles and discussed various considerations when planning for CFR-PEEK instrumentation in patients undergoing MSTS. Factors include preoperative construct planning, intraoperative CFR-PEEK system handling, and postoperative considerations such as the requirement for RT planning. This review is the first to highlight various considerations for MSTS surgeons when applying CFR-PEEK instrumentation. This serves as an important guide for surgeons performing MSTS, with the continuous evolution of our treatment capacity in metastatic spinal disease (Level of evidence: IV)."

      "abstract": "The Fenton advanced oxidation technology is widely regarded as an effective solution for treating refractory industrial wastewater. However, a major challenge lies in the substantial generation of hazardous sludge. In this study, a novel membrane Fenton (MF) technique was developed, enabling efficient reuse of Fenton sludge and significantly reducing its discharge. To ensure stable and efficient performance under Fenton reaction conditions, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene hollow fiber membranes were fabricated by optimizing the stretching conditions. These membranes feature high porosity, low critical water yield pressure, high mechanical strength, and excellent oxidative resistance. The optimized membrane exhibited high water permeability (200.9 kg/m2h) and low effluent turbidity (1.31 NTU), making it suitable for Fenton sludge concentration. Subsequently, a sequential batch MF technique was designed to integrate the Fenton reaction, sludge concentration, and sludge reuse within a single reactor. The MF process reduced ferrous ion input and hazardous sludge production by 50 %, while achieving a comparable chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency (62.1-64.9 %) to the conventional Fenton process for metronidazole pharmaceutical wastewater. Furthermore, no irreversible membrane contamination occurred during eight continuous reaction batches. The prepared membranes also exhibited excellent chemical and mechanical stability, with no property changes detected after 40 days of immersion in the oxidant."

The effect of plasma treatment on the mechanical properties of HDPE/bamboo fiber composites was further studied, and the surface morphology and surface chemical structure of the materials before and after plasma treatment were analyzed. The results show that the surface wettability of HDPE can be significantly improved after O2 and N2 plasma treatment, which can further enhance the interface compatibility of HDPE/bamboo fiber composites and improve the impact and tensile strength of the composites (impact strength increased by 19.91% and 19.55% after O2 and N2 plasma treatment, respectively; tensile strength increased by 16.47% and 12.48%, respectively). The optimal process parameters for enhancing the interface compatibility of the two plasma composites are 1100 W, 13 s, and 1.75 L/min (O2 plasma), and 1100 W, 13 s, 2.5 L/min (N2 plasma); between the two, N2 plasma has a better effect on the surface wettability of HDPE than O2 plasma treatment."

A collagen peptide-based composite human hair repair emulsion (CHFRE) was formulated, and its repair efficacy on damaged hair (DH) was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and amino acid analysis. Following CHFRE treatment, the physical and chemical properties of damaged hair improved significantly. SEM analysis revealed enhanced hair luster, aligned cuticle scales, and a denser cortex. FTIR and DSC analyses showed a 5.94% increase in α-conformation content and a 28.44% rise in relative helical content (RHC), indicating enhanced protein stability and a conformation closer to that of normal hair. Additionally, the 14.63% increase in S=O transmittance suggested reduced oxidative damage. Amino acid analysis and hydrophobic amino acids, with specific increments of 16.77 g/100 g and 2.47 g/100 g, respectively, enhance hair affinity and keratin stability. This bio-based repair material effectively restores damaged hair structure, strengthens resistance to chemical damage, and ensures sustainability, safety, and biocompatibility, providing a promising approach for the development of natural hair repair products."

      "abstract": "This novel study explores a comprehensive approach, combining fiber and matrix structure-property relationships. By integrating alkali treatment, fiber mapping, and intrinsic fiber properties, this work offers a unique perspective on the mechanical, physical, and thermal properties of biodegradable composites of reinforced polypropylene (PP) and plasticized poly (lactic acid) (PLA), with 25 wt% Kenaf (KBF), Bagasse, Hemp fibers and softwood fibers serving as a control. To enhance fiber-matrix interaction, fibers underwent alkaline treatment using 5% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) for one hour. The mechanical properties, including tensile strength, Young's modulus, and impact strength, were evaluated alongside physical and thermal properties such as fiber mapping, brightness, heat deflection temperature (HDT), melting temperature, melt flow ratio (MFR), and melt flow index (MFI). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to assess the biocomposites' morphology. The results showed that fiber reinforcement improved the tensile and impact strength of PP composites, particularly for treated Bagasse (6.6% and 22%) and Hemp (7% and 44.7%), while Kenaf exhibited minimal change, indicating its inherently high strength. A slight increase in tensile strength and Young's modulus was observed in all PLA-based composites. The addition of 25% fiber enhanced the thermal properties of both treated and untreated fiber-reinforced composites. Among PP composites, those reinforced with treated fibers exhibited the highest HDT, with Kenaf achieving the best performance (124 °C), followed by Bagasse (93 °C). The HDT values for untreated fibers were 119 °C for KBF, 100 °C for softwood, 86 °C for Bagasse, and 79 °C for Hemp. PLA composites showed a slight increase in HDT with fiber reinforcement. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) revealed a slight decrease in melting temperature for PP composites and a slight increase for PLA composites. Fiber mapping analysis indicated that Kenaf had the highest aspect ratio, contributing to superior mechanical performance, while Hemp had the lowest aspect ratio and exhibited weaker mechanical properties. Overall, Kenaf and Bagasse fibers demonstrated superior mechanical and thermal properties, comparable to those of softwood fibers, whereas Hemp exhibited moderate performance. The variations in composites behavior were attributed to differences in fiber mapping, alkaline treatment, and the intrinsic properties of both the polymer matrices and the reinforcing fibers. These findings highlight the potential of treated natural fibers, particularly Kenaf and Bagasse, in enhancing the mechanical and thermal properties of biodegradable composites, reinforcing their suitability for sustainable material applications."

      "abstract": "Efficient delivery of photons to visceral organs is critical for the treatment of deep-seated tumors taking advantage of photo theranostics. Optical fiber can be regarded as a direct and facile photon pathway for targeting tumor lesion. However, current fiber theranostic strategies rely on the spatially separated optical fibers to realize diagnosis and therapy independently, resulting in low compactness, poor continuity of medical process, and incompatibility with current medical technologies. Herein, an integrated fiber-optic theranostic (iFOT) probe is developed that merges tumor microenvironment sensing and photothermal therapy by functionalizing the fiber with graphene/gold nanostar hybrid materials and hypoxic-responsive fluorophores. The iFOT probe can quickly detect the hypoxia of xenograft tumors of mice with high sensitivity. The tumors can be photothermally killed on-site through the same fiber probe tightly followed by detection, which presents a high cure rate. More importantly, the iFOT is highly adaptable to the conventional medical imaging and endoscopic techniques, which facilitates the imaging-assisted navigation and manipulation by use of the interventional trocar. The proposed strategy can be used as an effective endoscopic and interventional tool for tackling deep-situated tumor and may open a revolutionized pathway to bridge separate diagnosis and therapy process in the current stage."

The artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) remains one of the most effective intervention for severe UI, with its design relying on a detailed understanding of the urethral biomechanics. Given the ethical and logistical constraints of using human tissue, porcine urethras, which share anatomical and mechanical similarities with human urethras, are widely employed in preclinical studies. This study investigates the uniaxial mechanical characterization of porcine urethral tissue under controlled conditions. Fresh porcine urethral samples were subjected to uniaxial tensile testing along both the longitudinal and circumferential directions to characterize their anisotropic mechanical properties. Experimental results were compared with existing datasets to validate findings. Additionally, conventional hyperelastic models were assessed to fit experimental results, and a novel anisotropic constitutive model with physical parameters was developed. This fiber model, which incorporates fiber modulus, volume, and orientation, uses a single set of parameters to predict behavior in both directions. It demonstrated improved accuracy, reaching the performance of the Gasser-Ogden-Holzapfel (GOH) model, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 9.24% and 12.98% in the circumferential and longitudinal directions, respectively. In contrast, the Yeoh and Ogden models were unable to fit both directions using a single set of parameters, yielding RMSEs values exceeding 30%. With its enhanced physical relevance, the fiber model having a more physical meaning holds promise for applications in the biomechanical analysis of fiber-composed soft tissues."

      "abstract": "Restoring endodontically treated teeth (ETT) that exhibit cracks, enlarged roots, or weakened root walls is a frequent challenge in dental practice. The present study describes three cases in which contemporary restorative techniques were employed and suggests that applying Ribbond tape (RT) to ETT can improve fracture resistance and better prevent the propagation of cracks compared with traditional methods. Although extensive in vitro research has been conducted on fiber-reinforced composites, studies evaluating the clinical use and durability of fiber-reinforced composites to restore ETT are limited. This report strictly adhered to the case report (CARE) guidelines, and the treatments were initiated only after signed informed consents were obtained from the patients. Therefore, the old restorations were removed from the teeth that required intervention and composite resin core build-up was created, followed by endodontic treatments or retreatment. Subsequently, the endodontic accesses were reinforced with RT. The protective restorations were performed and bonded. The two-year follow-ups showed that the patients had complete remission of signs and symptoms, and they remain under monitoring. The study emphasizes the importance of internal reinforcement of ETT and strengthening weakened walls with a resin core build-up reinforced with fibers like RT. This approach enhances mechanical retention, inhibit fracture propagation, and establish a strong chemical bond between RT and resin. It is suggested to be a promising strategy for increasing the longevity and strength of the teeth, providing a conservative and effective alternative to traditional methods."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Over the past few decades, research on affective touch has clarified its impact on key psychological functions essential for environmental adaptation, such as self-awareness, self-other differentiation, attachment, and stress response. These effects are primarily driven by the stimulation of C-tactile (CT) fibers. Despite significant advancements in understanding the fundamental mechanisms of affective touch, its clinical applications in mental health remain underdeveloped. This systematic review aims to rigorously assess the scientific literature on the relationship between CT fiber stimulation and psychological disorders, evaluating its potential as a therapeutic intervention. METHODS: This systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. A search was performed in the EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science databases for articles published in the last 10 years. The review focused on two main aspects: (1) potential dysregulation of CT fibers in individuals with psychological disorders, and (2) psychological treatments based on CT fiber stimulation and their psychological and functional outcomes. RESULTS: Most studies investigating CT fiber dysregulation in psychological disorders reported sensory alterations, with patients rating affective touch as less pleasant than healthy controls. These differences were often associated with dysregulation in the reward network and interoceptive processing, with several studies suggesting reduced insular cortex activation as a contributing factor. Regarding psychological treatments, only a limited number of studies analyzed therapies based on CT fiber stimulation. Despite methodological variations and differences in psychological diagnoses, the available evidence suggests that affective touch therapies can effectively reduce symptom severity and improve interoception across different psychological conditions. DISCUSSION: The findings underscore the potential of affective touch as a therapeutic avenue for psychological disorders. However, given the dearth of studies on this topic, further analyses are necessary to fully understand its mechanisms and clinical efficacy. Expanding research in this area could provide valuable insights into functional impairments related to CT fiber dysregulation and support the development of targeted interventions for mental health treatment."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: LHON leads to gradual, painless, and permanent vision loss in both eyes, often associated with central scotomas. As the condition progresses, there is a decline in visual function, accompanied by noticeable structural alterations. This study focused on evaluating the clinical characteristics of patients with differing LHON stages, with a specific emphasis on optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging results. METHODS: This analysis included 22 individuals with LHON. Patients underwent thorough clinical ophthalmologic assessments, including SD-OCT, Visual evoked potentials, and perimetry. When LHON was suspected, blood samples were obtained to test for the three major mitochondrial mutations (G1178A, T14484C, G3460A), with further sequencing to identify additional known mutations. The data were subsequently examined through descriptive statistical methods. RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of 22 individuals (median age 33, range 9-68) were examined. All participants carried a mutation linked to LHON. The most prevalent mutation was G11778A (55%), followed by G3460A (23%), T14484C (14%), with one instance each of the rare G13042A and C3461T mutations. Fourteen participants experienced acute vision loss (average duration: 5.2 ± 5 months), while eight had chronic LHON. There was no significant difference in visual acuity (VA, logMAR) between the two groups (0.9 vs. 0.9, p = 0.91). However, chronic patients exhibited significantly reduced the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), especially in the temporal region (32 μm vs. 56 μm, p < 0.0001), but not in the nasal region. Ganglion cell layer (GCL) thickness was also notably thinner in the temporal area for chronic patients compared to those with acute LHON (22 μm vs. 28 μm, p = 0.04). Linear regression analysis showed correlations between RNFL and GCL and visual acuity (R² = 0.18, p = 0.007 and R² = 0.1, p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: In our analysis, we observed an unusual pattern in the genetic mutations, with G3460A being the second most frequent, rather than T14484C, which may be attributed to the limited sample size. 14 patients experienced acute or subacute vision loss, while eight were assessed for chronic disease. Those with chronic LHON demonstrated significantly thinner GCL and RNFL. These results underscore the importance of accelerating both diagnosis and treatment to facilitate prompt intervention for patients.",

      "abstract": "Calcarenite sand, as a key geotechnical material in the construction of South China Sea islands and reefs, is limited in its engineering applications due to its significant high compressibility characteristics. This study proposes a treatment method combining Enzyme-Induced Calcium Carbonate Precipitation (EICP) with coir fiber. Through a series of one-dimensional compression tests, the effects of different grouting times (0, 3, 6, 9), coir fiber contents (0%, 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.8%), and relative densities (30%, 60%, 90%) on the compressive characteristics of calcarenite sand were systematically investigated. The research findings indicate that as the number of EICP grouting cycles increases, the reduction in the void ratio of the samples gradually diminishes. Under the same conditions, the addition of coir fiber initially leads to a decrease in the reduction of the void ratio, followed by an increasing trend. The experimental data under various conditions were successfully fitted using the Harris function, elucidating the relationships between the model parameters b and c and the factors of calcium carbonate content, coir fiber content, and initial void ratio. Additionally, the Lasso regularization method was employed, and a polynomial model equation was established using Matlab software based on the method of defining training and testing datasets (with the parameter b as a 4th-order polynomial and the c as a 3rd-order polynomial). Validation demonstrated that the constructed model equations possess high predictive accuracy and generalization capability. This study not only deepens the understanding of the one-dimensional compressive deformation of calcarenite sand under the synergistic effect of coir fiber and EICP technology, but also provides a theoretical basis for the rapid assessment and optimization of the compressive characteristics of calcarenite sand foundations in the construction of South China Sea islands and reefs."

      "abstract": "Inflammatory cell infiltration and myofiber necrosis are pathological hallmarks of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM). Methyl 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (MDHB) is a natural phenolic acid compound, renowned for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In this study, we investigated its protective mechanisms targeting muscle fiber necrosis and macrophage pyroptosis by regulating oxidative stress in IIM. In the present study, we found that increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and decreased nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) protein expression were shown on the muscle fibers of experimental autoimmune myositis (EAM). Receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIPK1) and receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIPK3) protein expression were elevated in EAM. In vitro, MDHB protected C2C12 cells and myotubes against H2O2-induced cell viability damage. MDHB decreased the levels of oxidative stress such as ROS, and mitochondrial superoxide (MitoSOX), and rescued mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP generation. MDHB inhibited necroptosis of the C2C12 cells and myotubes under H2O2 stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, MDHB suppressed lipopolysaccharide and nigericin-induced caspase-1 cleavage and interleukin (IL-1β) secretion, indicating suppression of macrophage pyroptosis in vitro. In vivo, treatment with MDHB suppressed EAM-induced muscle weakness and inflammation. MDHB decreased ROS accumulation, and increased Nrf2 and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression in EAM mice's muscles, thereby inhibiting necroptosis of inflamed muscle species and macrophage pyroptosis. In conclusion, we demonstrated that MDHB could be a novel therapy for IIM that alleviates inflammation, muscle fiber necroptosis, and macrophage pyroptosis by regulating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the influence of various cusp reduction amounts, localization, and the use of coronal polyethylene fiber on cusp deflection in endodontically treated molar teeth. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 120 intact molar teeth observed in the study were divided into 12 groups, and standard MOD cavities were prepared after the root canal treatment was completed. Groups 1 and 2 were determined as positive and negative control groups, respectively. Two cusp reductions were applied to Groups 3, 4, 5, and 6, and functional cusps reduction were applied to Groups 7, 8, 9, and 10. The cusp reductions were either 1.5 mm or 3 mm. After preparation, Groups 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 were restored with Filtek One Bulk-Fill, while Groups 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 were restored with Filtek One Bulk-Fill + Ribbond. As the teeth were restored, the amount of cusp deflection was measured with a twin channel deflection gauge device. The fracture strength of the teeth was measured using a universal test machine. The experimental results were statistically evaluated with two-way and one-way ANOVA tests. RESULTS: The reinforcement of the coronal structure with fiber reduced cusp deflection and increased fracture strength. The statistically significantly less cusp deflection was obtained in the groups with the same cavity design of having fiber placed than in the groups without fiber placed (p < 0.001). The statistically significantly lower fracture strength was obtained in Group 11 than all the reduced groups except Groups 5 and 7 (p < 0.05). The statistically lower fracture strength was obtained in Group 12, than in Group 4 (p < 0.05). Experimental groups with cusp reduction showed less cusp deflection (p < 0.001) and higher fracture strength (p < 0.05) than experimental groups without cusp reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Fiber application and cusp reduction may have positive effects in terms of reducing cusp deflection and increasing fracture strength in direct restoration cases involving excessive substance loss in endodontically treated teeth. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Incorporating cusp reduction and coronal fiber applications in treatment plans for endodontically treated teeth ensures that restorations are both functional and durable.",

Among the many potential candidates for DDSs, there are one-dimensional micro- and nanostructured materials such as electrospun fibers. In this study, two different polymers, i.e., amphiphilic block copolymer (poly(2-vinylpyridine-co-styrene)) and hydrophobic polymer (polycaprolactone), were utilized as base materials for fibers. Through the electrospinning and coaxial electrospinning techniques, fibers with diverse architectures were obtained, homogeneous or core/shell structures. An antibacterial drug (metronidazole) in varying concentrations was incorporated into the electrospun fibers. The potential application of the obtained electrospun fiber mats is as a dressing for wounds or the treatment of periodontitis. The average diameter of fibers fell within the range of 700-1300 nm, with a drug content of 7-27 wt %. The amorphization or decrease in crystallinity of metronidazole present in the fibers was achieved during the electrospinning process. In vitro drug release tests showed that burst effects can be successfully suppressed, and more sustained release can be accomplished for some formulations. Therefore, electrospun polymer fiber mats are promising candidates for the local delivery of active substances."

      "abstract": "Carbon is an abundant material with remarkable thermal, mechanical, physical, and chemical properties. Each allotrope has unique structures, properties, functionalities, and corresponding applications. Over the past few decades, various types of carbon materials such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, carbon quantum dots, and carbon fibers have been produced, finding applications in energy conversion and storage, water treatment, sensing, polymer composites, and biomedical fields. Among these carbon materials, porous carbons are highly interesting owing to their large surface areas and massive active sites to interact with molecules, ions, and other chemical species. The pore size and pore size distributions can be tunable (micro-, meso-, and macro-pores), providing chemical species with hierarchical structures to transport with low resistances. In this context, designing carbon precursors and preparing porous carbon with desired structures, properties, and functionalities are highly significant. Polymers are versatile carbon precursors. Designing the polymer precursors that facilitate the formation of well-controlled pores is an effective strategy to prepare porous carbons. In particular, porous carbon fibers (PCFs) in a fibrous format offer additional features of hierarchical porosity control, increased surface area, and fast ion transport. The most common approach to synthesizing PCFs is to use sacrificial agents (e.g., homopolymers of polystyrene (PS) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), inorganic nanoparticles, and other additives) in a matrix of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) as the carbon fiber precursor. However, the nonuniform mixing of sacrificial agents in the PAN matrix results in PCFs with nonuniform pores and wide pore size distributions. Moreover, complete removal of the inorganic additives is challenging and sometimes requires the use of hazardous chemicals. Therefore, developing innovative methods for synthesizing PCFs is imperative to advance these engineering materials for emerging applications. In this Account, we summarize our efforts on the use of block copolymer precursors to prepare PCFs with tunable pore sizes and pore size distributions for a series of applications. First, we will introduce the synthesis methodologies for preparing PCFs. We have used reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization to synthesize block copolymer precursors. Second, we will discuss the effects of preparation conditions on the properties of PCFs. The mechanical and electrical properties highly depend on the composition of the block copolymer, pyrolysis conditions, and humidity level during the fiber spinning process. Lastly, we will discuss the effects of controlled porosity on the surface area, electrical/ionic conductivity, and polymer-matrix interactions, which are crucial for applications including energy storage (e.g., batteries and supercapacitors), fiber-reinforced polymer composites, separation, and filtration."

However, there are no reports on the initial results of TFL in Japan. This study aimed to assess the initial results of TFL in retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) and to compare them with those of holmium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Ho: YAG) laser with MOSES technology. METHODS: This retrospective single-center study compared perioperative results, complications, and the \"stone-free\" rate (defined as ≤ 2 mm fragments on computed tomography 1 month after RIRS) between the TFL (60 W) (group A, n = 48) and Ho: YAG laser with MOSES technology (120 W) (group B, n = 48) laser. The inclusion criteria were renal or ureteral stones ≤ 20 mm in diameter and those scheduled for single-stage RIRS. RESULTS: The two groups had similar baseline patient characteristics. No significant differences were found in operative time (45 vs. 54 min, P = 0.10), laser time (15 vs. 10 min, P = 0.12), stone-free rate (97.9% vs. 95.8%, P = 1.00), ureteral injury (2.1% vs. 8.3%, P = 0.36), or postoperative fever (0% vs. 4.2%, P = 0.49) between groups A and B. However, significant differences were found in basketing time (7 vs. 21 min, P < 0.01) between groups A and B. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that RIRS with TFL had similar results and no difference in complications compared to RIRS with Ho: YAG laser with MOSES technology. The TFL had a significantly shorter basketing time than the Ho: YAG laser with MOSES technology. Furthermore, future research is needed to determine suitable laser settings for the TFL.",

METHODS: In a double blind, placebo-controlled trial, adult participants aged 18-70 years old with MASLD were randomized to receive prebiotic (oligofructose-enriched inulin, 16 g/day; n = 22) or isocaloric placebo (maltodextrin; n = 20) for 24 weeks alongside weight loss counseling from a registered dietitian. Primary outcomes were change in intrahepatic fat % (IHF%) and hepatic injury from baseline to 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes included body composition, subjective appetite, serum lipids and cytokines, fecal microbiota, and serum metabolomics. RESULTS: At baseline, participants had IHF of 14.4 ± 8.4%. The change in IHF from baseline to 24 weeks did not differ between prebiotic and placebo. Prebiotic participants had a greater decrease (p = 0.029) in percent trunk fat compared to placebo. Compared to placebo, prebiotic significantly decreased desire to eat and hunger ratings over the course of the intervention. Fecal microbiota analysis showed a significant increase in Bifidobacterium abundance with prebiotic. A pathway analysis based on untargeted serum metabolomics revealed a downregulation of taurine and hypotaurine metabolism in the placebo group which was conserved in the prebiotic group. CONCLUSION: Adding prebiotic fiber supplementation to weight loss counseling for adults with MASLD enhanced reductions in trunk fat and had a beneficial effect on subjective appetite compared to placebo. Improvements in fecal microbial profile and taurine metabolism revealed specific beneficial effects of prebiotics in the management of MASLD.

Following incomplete endodontic treatment, teeth 21 and 22 presented with Ellis Class III fractures and open apices, while tooth 11 had a closed apex with an ill-defined radiolucency. Treatment involved apexification using Biodentine (Septodont, Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, France), laser-assisted disinfection, and reinforcement with fiber-reinforced composites (Dentapreg® Ultra Fine Mesh (UFM), Advanced Dental Material, Brno, Czech Republic). Post-endodontic restoration included porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns. The integration of modern materials and techniques, such as laser disinfection and fiber-reinforced posts, resulted in successful structural reinforcement and apical closure, highlighting the effectiveness of contemporary endodontic approaches in treating complex cases."

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the feasibility of transoral 980 nm and 1470 nm dual-wavelength fiber laser combined with flexible endoscopes for porcine anterior commissure resection. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five healthy adult pigs were used as experimental subjects. The procedure involved exposing the anterior commissure using a flxible laryngoscope and resecting it using the dual-wavelength laser. The assessment focused on the ease of exposure and resection. RESULTS: In all five presented pigs, the vocal folds' anterior commissure was well exposed. Furthermore, the anterior commissure of the pigs could be smoothly resected, with the resection range reaching the thyroid cartilage plate, and there were no difficulties in resection due to obstruction by the laryngoscope. No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: The study demonstrates the feasibility and safety of using a flxible laryngoscope combined with a dual-wavelength laser for porcine anterior commissure resection. This approach offers potential as a method for laser surgery in human laryngeal diseases, particularly glottic laryngeal cancer involving the anterior commissure.",

This study investigated the incorporation of quinoa flour and date seed powder as fiber sources into chicken and fish paste formulations at a 6% concentration, with varying ratios of quinoa flour to date seed powder: 0:0 (T1), 100:0 (T2), 75:25 (T3), and 50:50 (T4). The results demonstrated that adding these ingredients markedly improved the dietary fiber content, water holding capacity, cooking yield, and pH levels of the nuggets (p < 0.05). Notably, the T4 treatment exhibited the lowest oil absorption (3.82 g for chicken and 5.19 g for fish per 100 g of product) among all formulations (p < 0.05). The fiber-enriched nuggets exhibited noticeable differences in texture and color. Additionally, the incorporation of quinoa flour and date seed powder positively influenced the sensory attributes of the nuggets, with T3 achieving the highest overall acceptance score. This formulation was identified as the most favorable option for both chicken and fish nuggets, owing to its optimal cooking yield, high acceptance, adequate fiber content, and minimal oil absorption."

The development of rapid and environmentally friendly degumming methods for ramie fibers remains challenging in both academic research and industrial production. Therefore, this study aims to create a novel alkaline deep eutectic solvent (A-DES) system for efficient and sustainable degumming of ramie fibers, optimize the degumming parameters and comparise its performance with traditional alkali boiling method. Through optimization of process parameters based on comprehensive evaluation of fiber yield, residual gum content, fiber fineness, and breaking tenacity, the optimal conditions were established as a ChCl:MEA molar ratio of 1:8 and a degumming temperature of 140 °C. The degumming mechanism was evaluated through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Comparative analysis revealed that the A-DES degumming approach yielded single ramie fibers with minimal residual hemicellulose and lignin content, improved crystallinity, and enhanced thermal stability. These properties were comparable to those obtained through conventional alkali treatment. Notably, this method demonstrated significant advantages in terms of cost saving and environmental impact, with reduced processing time and minimized chemical consumption. Furthermore, the recycled A-DES maintained effective degumming performance. It produced refined ramie fibers that met the third-class national standard through three consecutive cycles without purification. These findings highlight the potential of this novel method for industrial-scale applications."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:  Restoration of endodontically treated teeth (ETT) presents a significant challenge due to compromised structural integrity. The ferrule effect is crucial in reinforcing teeth and improving fracture resistance. This study aimed to compare and evaluate the effect of different crown ferrules on the fracture resistance of ETT restored with a glass fiber post and to evaluate the failure pattern. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-six extracted human maxillary central incisors were selected and randomly divided into four groups (n = 14 per group) based on ferrule height: Group 1 (control, no ferrule with a metal post), Group 2 (0 mm ferrule with a glass fiber post), Group 3 (2 mm ferrule with a glass fiber post), and Group 4 (3 mm ferrule with a glass fiber post). After endodontic treatment and post-space preparation, the teeth were restored using composite cores and full metal crowns. A universal testing machine was used to apply a compressive load at a 45° angle until fracture occurred. The fracture resistance was recorded in Newtons (N), and the failure modes were analyzed under a stereomicroscope. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc Tukey test (p < 0.05). RESULTS: The mean fracture resistance values were highest in Group 1 (559.68 ± 92.52 N) and lowest in Group 2 (215.60 ± 70.79 N). Group 3 (428.53 ± 154.27 N) and Group 4 (439.06 ± 118.83 N) exhibited significantly higher fracture resistance than Group 2 (p = 0.001) but were not significantly different from each other (p = 0.950). Unfavorable root fractures were predominant in Group 1 and Group 2, whereas Group 3 and Group 4 showed repairable core-debonding failures. CONCLUSIONS: Ferrules play a significant role in the fracture resistance of glass fiber post-restored teeth. Increasing the ferrule length significantly increases fracture resistance. Although metal posts provide higher fracture resistance, they are associated with a greater incidence of non-repairable failures. Glass fiber posts combined with an adequate ferrule are a more favorable option for restoring structurally compromised teeth."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study used micro-computed tomography (µCT) to assess the post space preparation systems [Rebilda (VOCO), RelyX (3M)] and preparations of varying lengths to create root dentin cracks. METHODS: Forty extracted maxillary first premolars with two roots were randomly divided into four groups. Teeth were decoronated to a length of 18 mm. Following root canal treatment, first µCT scans were performed. Post spaces were prepared with Rebilda post drills at 1/2 of the working length (WL) in Group 1 and at 2/3 of the WL in Group 2, while post spaces were prepared with RelyX post drills at 1/2 of the WL in Group 3 and at 2/3 of the WL in Group 4. After post space preparation, second µCT scans were performed. Dentinal cracks were detected by comparing the first and second µCT scan images, which were classified as \"newly formed cracks\", \"advanced cracks\" and \"completed cracks\". The chi-square test was used to compare among the groups, with a p-value of < 0.05 considered statistically significant. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were observed between the groups for completed and advanced cracks (P > 0.05). In terms of newly formed cracks, the Rebilda-2/3 group showed more cracks than the RelyX-1/2 group, and the RelyX-2/3 group had more cracks than the RelyX-1/2 group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Completed and advanced cracks were observed in all groups, while no newly formed cracks were detected in the RelyX-1/2 group. The type of post drill and the preparation length are crucial factors in preventing the development of root dentinal cracks. Preparing 1/2 of the canal length may be a safer preparation length, and the RelyX drill may pose less risk of inducing root dentinal cracks.",

      "abstract": "Myocardial ischemia is one of the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases, underscoring the need for safer and effective therapeutic approaches. Peripheral nerve stimulation, particularly vagus nerve stimulation has emerged as a promising non-pharmaceutical therapy for managing myocardial ischemia. However, vagus nerve stimulation carries risks, such as off-target effects and adverse cardiac events due to its extensive innervation and mixed afferent/efferent fiber composition. Therefore, it is crucial to explore a safer and more user-friendly peripheral nerve interface. In this work, we developed a novel chronic median nerve interface using carbon nanotube fibers as electrodes to stimulate the median nerve at the acupoint PC6 for myocardial ischemia control. Carbon nanotube fibers exhibited excellent biocompatibility, flexibility, conductivity, and charge storage capacity, making them ideal for reliable and prolonged median nerve stimulation. Our results demonstrated that median nerve stimulation at the acupoint PC6 achieved therapeutic effects comparable to electroacupuncture, including improvement in S-T segment values, LF/HF ratios, cardiac index and cardiac troponin T, while being safer and easier to operate than vagus nerve stimulation. Moreover, median nerve stimulation exhibited superior transient and residual effects compared to electroacupuncture, despite a slower response time. Additionally, histological and fluorescence analyses confirmed the safety of the CNTF-based interface over time. These findings suggested that median nerve stimulation at the acupoint PC6 combined the efficacy of nerve stimulation with the safety of acupuncture, offering a promising approach for myocardial ischemia control, particularly in chronic and repeated treatment scenarios. Further researches are warranted to optimize CNTF properties, elucidate the underlying mechanisms of median nerve stimulation, and explore its potential in clinical applications.",

      "abstract": "The treatment of radioactive wastewater has attracted extensive attention. Here, an adsorbent was designed to achieve efficient, stable, and recyclable removal of cesium ion contamination, and its adsorption properties were studied in detail. Prussian blue, a promising adsorbent for radioactive wastewater purification, has been often hindered in application due to its small size and easy agglomeration. To address this issue, the luffa fiber with a large specific surface area was employed to form networks loading Prussian blue particles and enhance adsorption capacity. In this paper, the recyclable Prussian blue/luffa was prepared by an in situ synthesis approach. Means such as XRD, SEM, EDS, FTIR, and XPS were applied to characterize its morphology and physicochemical properties. It exhibited outstanding selective removal efficiency for Cs+ ions and the ability to be rapidly separated from wastewater. The equilibrium and adsorption kinetics followed the Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order model with a maximum adsorption capacity of 102.01 mg/g. Both pH and temperature had effects on the adsorption performance. The removal efficiency of Cs+ by Prussian blue/luffa still retained 71.2% after the 3-cycle test, and the possible mechanism was ion caging and ion exchange. In addition, the presence of co-existing ions only reduced the removal rate by less than 10.0%. Importantly, phytotoxicity assessment is urgently needed to address the adverse effects of applied nanoparticle composites on environmental and human safety. The phytotoxicity assessment was investigated, and the results indicated that the composite had no obvious biotoxicity. It is expected to be a highly potential material for disposing of radioactive wastewater. Future applications may extend to the treatment of various types of radioactive waste, providing a sustainable and effective solution to the field of nuclear waste management.",

The conditions are successfully treated with transurethral enucleation of the prostate (TUEP) plus bladder lithotomy. However, open surgery is associated with higher blood loss, larger incisions, prolonged operative time, and may impede patient recovery. AIM: This work explored the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of using thulium laser enucleation of the prostate (ThuLEP) and thulium fiber laser (TFL) on a single‑energy platform to treat BPH combined with BS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty‑one patients with BPH complicated by BSs who underwent ThuLEP+TFL at our institution between October 2020 and September 2022 were included in the observation group, while 31 patients undergoing TUEP plus bladder lithotomy during the same period constituted the control group. Data collection involved assessing differences in the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), hemoglobin (Hb) levels, maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax), and quality of life (QoL) before and after surgery, along with follow‑up results. RESULTS: The patients in the observation group exhibited lower surgery duration, smaller postoperative decrease in Hb levels, shorter duration of postoperative indwelling catheterization, and proportion of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) II patients, with a higher proportion of ASA I patients than the individuals in the control group (P <0.05). Additionally, in comparison with the control group, the patients in the observation group had lower postoperative IPSS scores and higher levels of Hb, Qmax, and QoL score (P <0.05). There was no significant difference in the postoperative stone clearance rate between the 2 groups (P >0.05); however, the postoperative length of hospital stay was shorter in the observation group (P <0.05), with a higher incidence of complications in the control (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, ThuLEP+TFL surgery was safe and feasible in treating BPH+BS, relieving the symptoms, and improving QoL."

      "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying the antihypertensive effect of dietary fibers remain poorly understood. This study investigates whether dietary fiber supplementation can prevent cardiovascular damage and high blood pressure in a genetic model of neurogenic hypertension. Six-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and their respective normotensive control, Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY), were divided into four groups: Untreated WKY, untreated SHR, SHR treated with resistant starch (SHR + RS), and SHR treated with inulin-type fructans (SHR + ITF) for 12 weeks. Additionally, a faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiment was conducted, transferring faecal content from treated SHR donors to recipient SHRs. A diet rich in RS fiber reduced vascular oxidative stress, inflammation, and high blood pressure. These protective effects were associated with a reshaped gut microbiota, leading to increased short-chain fatty acid production, reduced endotoxemia, decreased sympathetic activity, and a restored balance between Th17 and Treg lymphocytes in mesenteric lymph nodes and aorta. Elevated plasma levels of acetate and butyrate in the SHR + RS group correlated with increased expression of aortic GPR41, GRP43 and PPARδ. Conversely, ITF treatment failed to prevent hypertension or endothelial dysfunction in SHR. FMT from the SHR + RS group to recipient SHR partially replicated these beneficial effects. This study highlights the antihypertensive benefits of dietary insoluble RS fiber, which are attributed to enhanced short-chain fatty acids production in the gut. This leads to improved gut permeability, reduced sympathetic tone, and diminished vascular T-cell accumulation. Therefore, dietary interventions with RS fiber may offer promising therapeutic strategies for preventing hypertension.",

One of the most frequent severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs) induced by ipi is diarrhea as a symptom of ir-colitis. Here, the composition of the gut microbiome was shown to correlate with the risk of developing colitis. Stimulated by a patient case and the knowledge that nutrition influences the gut microbiome, we performed a retrospective analysis to evaluate dietary habits and the frequency of colitis in patients with ipi ± nivo therapy. METHODS: Patients with metastasized stage III or IV melanoma who were treated with ipi ± nivo and who were willing to take part in a nutritional survey and interview at least three months after the first ipi dose were included into the study. Dietary habits were investigated using the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and personal interviews. The calculated daily intake of calories, carbohydrates, fats, proteins, sugars, and dietary fiber was correlated with the development of ir-colitis. RESULTS: 20 patients were included into this study, and all but one received ipi-nivo combination therapy. The median age was 59.5 years, and 60 % were male. 4 of 20 patients (20 %) developed ir-colitis grade 3 after two cycles in the median and were managed with at least high-dose corticosteroids. The FFQ and interview were conducted in a median of six months after treatment initiation. In general, the interviewed patients followed a typical western-pattern diet based on carbohydrates as the main, followed by fat as the second most important energy substrate. Comparing patients with and without colitis our investigation revealed that the achieved amount of recommended dietary fiber intake per total energy intake (TEI) was negatively associated with diarrhea and colitis (p = 0.061). No significant differences concerning daily intake of calories, carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and sugar were found. In addition, no significant differences were found among patients in terms of their age, gender, tobacco use, supplement intake, therapy regime, or body mass index (BMI). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study gives first hints that nutritional habits might influence treatment tolerability to ipi ± nivo therapy. A high-fiber diet might protect against ir-colitis and diarrhea in ipi-treated patients. This observation should be validated by a prospective randomized interventional trial. However, if it is possible to prevent ir-colitis by a high-fiber diet that would be of great impact on routine patient treatment."

      "abstract": "The existing screening methods for therapeutic targets of active ingredients in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) have problems of long detection time and high instrument cost. This article proposes a new target screening method based on virtual screening and fiber surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing technology, which has the characteristics of flexibility, speed, and low cost. It also reveals the target mechanism of the active ingredient isoquercitrin in the treatment of insulin resistance (IR). The binding energies of isoquercitrin with target proteins PDPK1, INSR, and PTPN1 were calculated using computer virtual methods to be -8.9, -8.9, -8.8 kcal/mol, indicating strong binding activity with isoquercitrin and predicted as three key targets. Then a fiber optic SPR biosensor functionalized with isoquercitrin molecules was constructed to detect the binding affinity between isoquercitrin and the key targets. The experimental results showed that the binding affinities of isoquercitrin to the targets PDPK1, INSR, and PTPN1 were 1.45, 1.14, and 13.21, respectively, indicating that PTPN1 is the main target of isoquercitrin in the treatment of IR. The proposed sensor has a sensitivity of 0.699 nm/(μg/ml), LOD of 0.515μg/ml, and the experimental detection time of this method is as low as 45 minutes, without the need for large and expensive optical demodulation equipment, and the device volume is 5.50 dm3, providing new ideas for the screening of therapeutic targets of active ingredients in TCM."

      "abstract": "Skeletal muscle is the major tissue for metabolic activity in the body and performs a variety of physiological functions. Among these, muscle fiber types are decisive in muscle function and meat quality. Numerous studies have shown that natural products can affect the development of skeletal muscle, regulate the formation of muscle fibers, and impact muscle function under physiological or pathological conditions. Baicalin, a natural flavonoid compound mainly derived from the dried roots of Scutellaria baicalensis, has been reported to affect glucose metabolism and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. However, the role of baicalin in the conversion of skeletal muscle fiber types and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the effects of baicalin on skeletal muscle fiber conversion in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro experiment used C2C12 cells as a model, with a baicalin treatment concentration of 125 μM; the in vivo experiment used C57BL/6J mice and weaned piglets as the models. The results showed that baicalin could participate in the remodeling of skeletal muscle fibers, promoting the conversion from glycolytic fibers to oxidative fibers in mice and pigs. This was evidenced by increased protein and mRNA expression levels of genes related to oxidative fibers, upregulated SDH enzyme activity, and mitochondrial complex expression in vivo and in vitro, while the protein and mRNA expression levels of genes related to glycolytic fibers were decreased, and LDH enzyme activity was downregulated. Mechanistic studies revealed that baicalin, as a small molecule, could target and bind to the p38 MAPK protein, increase its expression and phosphorylation levels, and activate the p38 MAPK/PGC-1α signaling pathway. Collectively, these data showed that baicalin induced a shift in skeletal muscle fiber composition from glycolytic to oxidative myofibers by activating the p38 MAPK/PGC-1α signaling pathway, thereby affecting the meat quality.",

In this study, we investigated the improvement of diabetes-related symptoms in db/db mice by 10 % BDF and explored the possible mechanisms. The results showed that hyperglycemia, hyperlipemia, insulin resistance, elevated body weight, severe inflammatory response and impaired intestinal function were significantly improved after 8 weeks of BDF intervention. Moreover, BDF was able to ameliorate the distribution of gut microbiota, enhance the bacteria associated with T2DM, and improve glucose metabolism by altering the levels of the metabolites of gut microbiota, bile acids (BAs), and their receptors, TGR5 and FXR. In addition, BDF activated the hepatic IRS-1/PI3K/AKT pathway which can reduce hepatic gluconeogenesis and promoted glycogen synthesis. Taken together, our results suggest that BDF can alleviate T2DM symptoms by activating the IRS-1/PI3K/AKT pathway and the gut microbiota-BAs-TGR5/FXR axis. The results of this study deepen the exploration of the active ingredients of cereals and suggesting a scientific basis for the development of glucose-lowering functional foods and nutraceuticals."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial compared the 15-year clinical success and survival rate of endodontically treated teeth restored with glass-fiber or metal posts. METHODS: 131 patients in need of 182 post and single-crown restorations were included. Teeth were randomly assigned to the control group (metal post, Parapost XT, Coltène) or test group (glass-fiber post). Teeth in the test group were further divided based on the size and shape of the root canal (RC). Teeth with a small RC were restored with prefabricated glass-fiber posts (Parapost Fiberlux, Coltène) and teeth with a wide oval canal with custom-made glass-fiber posts (Everstick, StickTech). Patients had follow-up appointments at 3, 5 and 15 years. Success (original post present) and survival (present after intervention) probability lifetime curves, corrected for clustering, were calculated (Kaplan-Meier). RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 179.6 ± 7 months, and the recall rate was 91.6 %. Success rate was 48.0 % for metal posts, 59.2 % for prefabricated glass-fiber posts and 49.5 % for custom glass-fiber posts. Survival rate was 53.6 % for metal posts, 68.5 % for prefab glass-fiber posts and 55.3 % for custom glass-fiber posts. No statistically significant effect of post material was observed. There was, however, a trend towards better success/survival for teeth with prefabricated glass-fiber posts. Teeth with metal posts failed more frequently due to root fracture than teeth with glass-fiber posts. CONCLUSIONS: There was a trend towards better clinical success and survival rate for teeth restored with glass-fiber posts, even though post material had no statistically significant effect on the clinical outcome. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: After 15-years, teeth restored with glass-fiber posts tended towards better clinical success and survival than teeth restored with gold-alloy posts. The difference in clinical outcome was, however, not statistically significant, probably due to a low effect size of the post material on success and survival.",

The regulatory effects of dietary fiber (especially insoluble dietary fiber), as a crucial element of the nutritional composition, on appetite remain poorly understood. This study investigated modulatory effects of konjac fiber (KF, with high and low expansion) and konjac powder (KP) on chyme digestion, gastrointestinal hormones, intestinal microbiota, appetite genes in hypothalamus, GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) protein in various tissues of rats by dietary intervention. The results showed that highly-expanded konjac fiber (HKF) significantly delayed gastric emptying and inhibited hydrolysis of chyme. Konjac fiber (KF), especially HKF, and KP increased short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) content and plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels. HKF upregulated the expression of GLP-1R protein in rat stomachs, nucleus tractus solitaries (NTS), and area postrema (AP) of rat brain, but down-regulated the expression of appetite gene AgRP/NPY in hypothalamus, thus, inhibiting appetite, reducing daily food intake and weight gain. Overall, this study reveals the mechanism through which expandable konjac fiber modulates appetite and chyme digestion in vivo by stomach-intestine-brain axis. Our findings provide an insight into the regulatory effects of insoluble dietary fiber on appetite and offered a valuable reference for the development of satiety-enhancing functional foods."

      "abstract": "A large amount of purified water is used in conventional hemodialysis (HD) for treating end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). To minimize the water demand and waste generation, the regeneration of dialysis solution is considered the most efficient control strategy. In this study, an innovative dual-layer hollow fiber (DLHF) mixed matrix membrane (MMM) incorporated with amine-functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MPS-NPs) was developed to regenerate spent dialysis solution. The fabricated DLHF-MMM configuration enabled the continuous removal of small, medium, and large weight uremic toxins (UTs) through dual mechanisms. The inner layer composed of polyethersulfone (PES) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) rejected medium-large weight UTs (i.e., MW > 500 Da) via the molecular sieving. Meanwhile, the outer layer containing amine-functionalized MPS-NPs effectively removed small weight UTs, such as urea and creatinine. The DLHF-MMM with 6 wt% of amine-functionalized MPS-NPs demonstrated the most favorable characteristics, i.e., high water permeability (298.6 ± 3.2 mL/m2.h.mmHg) and adsorption capacity of urea (523.5 mg/g) and creatinine (28.1 mg/g). Notably, the optimal membrane (DLHF-4) also achieved favorable removal rates from the spent dialysis solution of actual patient, i.e., urea (74.4 %), creatinine (56 %), hippuric acid (16.1 %), and lysozyme (58.7 %, additionally spiked as a mimicking for β-2 microglobulin). These results indicate that the fabricated DLHF-MMM in this study can effectively overcome the challenges posed by the complex matrix components. Overall, the results of this study demonstrate that the DLHF-MMM incorporated with amine-functionalized MPS-NPs is a promising and potential tool for the regeneration of dialysis solution. Furthermore, this approach can contribute to water conservation and reduce the burden on wastewater treatment processes associated with wastewater generated from conventional HD."

However, the fluctuation of T sways the RI response owing to high cross-sensitivity. To address the issue, a fiber-optic-based localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) sensor with a cascaded structure of a single-mode fiber-multimode fiber-single-mode fiber (SMF-MMF-SMF) is presented for synchronous measurement of RI and T. This detection principle is founded on the synergistic effects of the Mach-Zehnder interference (MZI) and LSPR. The cascaded structure was fabricated to inspire MZI, while LSPR was excited by gold nanoparticles/polydopamine (AuNPs/PDA) deposited on the fiber surface. The MZI and LSPR spectra were extracted and reconstructed using spectrum transformation and filtering techniques to sort the original spectra. The sensor achieved simultaneous detection of RI and T with a sensitivity of 3.58 (a.u.)/RIU and -0.0011 (a.u.)/°C, respectively. Additionally, the MZI signals near the LSPR wavelength in the absorption spectra are used to replace the extracted LSPR signal. Compared with the LSPR signal, the MZI signal exhibited over 30 times enhancement on the figure of merit (FOM) value due to its narrow full width at half maxima (FWHM). The sensor provided a novel strategy for synchronous measurement of RI and T, making it a promising alternative for in vivo photo-thermal therapy."

Structural, morphological, and thermal properties of NCCF were determined. Results revealed that the nanochitosan component improves the adsorption capacity of cotton fiber (CF) through the increased surface area and porosity of NCCF. Sorption studies were conducted based on pH, kinetics, isotherms, and desorption results. The Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms were utilized to examine the CF and NCCF adsorption mechanisms. NCCF exhibited maximum Langmuir adsorption capacities of 4.76 mmol/g for Cd2+, 6.40 mmol/g for Pb2+, and 12.50 mmol/g for Cr6+. Kinetic studies revealed that the pseudo-first-order kinetics model best describes the adsorption process. The results of the adsorption kinetics study showed that NCCF has a shorter half-time of adsorption than CF does during the adsorption process. This suggests that NCCF has a greater initial adsorption rate and adsorption capacity than CF. These findings are expected to lead to industrial applications in wastewater treatment as sustainable and highly effective materials."

      "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by all cell types into the extracellular environment. A subset of EVs, known as exosomes, range in size from 30 to 200 nm and are of biochemical interest due to their function as vehicles of intercellular communication. Their ability to transport proteinaceous species and genetic material at the cellular level makes them prime candidates as vectors in gene therapies. Focusing on biotherapeutics, bovine milk-derived extracellular vesicles (MDEVs) hold particular promise as an alternative to other exosome sources for therapeutics delivery. Bovine milk poses unique challenges due to the complex colloidal matrix, composed predominantly of fats and proteins like casein, which form micelles that exhibit exosome-like characteristics, specifically size and density. When faced with complex matrices like milk, conventional size/density-based isolation methods including ultracentrifugation and size exclusion chromatography struggle to provide high purity yields on practical time and cost scales. When paired with a stepwise hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) gradient, polyester (PET) capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers in column and spin-down tips formats have been used effectively to isolate exosomes from highly diverse sources. Here, PET C-CP fiber columns are demonstrated to isolate MDEVs from pre-treated raw milk, yielding concentrations of 1.5 × 1010 particles mL⁻1 with purities of ~2 × 1010 EVs µg-1 protein in less than 20 min. The efficacy of the isolation process is verified by a suite of characterization methods. Implementing PET C-CP fiber columns for MDEV isolation addresses the challenges associated with conventional isolation methods, holding promise for scale-up towards therapeutic applications.",

      "abstract": "In this study, the impact of lentil hull soluble dietary fibers (SDFs) on colitis and behavioral deficits in mice was assessed. Structural characterizations of SDFs confirmed that cellulase-modified soluble dietary fiber exhibited better physicochemical properties: more porous microstructure; similar polysaccharide structure; more stable particle size distribution; higher crystallinity; better adsorption capacity; and lower viscosity. Additionally, we explored its potential cognitive benefits via the gut-brain axis by behavioral tests, histopathology, 16S rRNA sequencing, gas chromatography and metabolomics analysis. The results showed that SDFs significantly improved inflammatory symptoms in colon and brain and cognitive behaviors. LSDF had better efficacy than HSDF. LSDF intervention decreased the harmful bacteria abundance (Bacteroides, Flexispira and Escherichia, etc.) and increased beneficial bacteria abundance (Aggregatibacter and Helicobacter, etc.). LSDF also affected brain metabolites through the sphingolipid metabolism. Spearman correlation analysis showed that there was a positive correlation between harmful bacteria with inflammatory factors (LPS, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, etc.) and sphingolipid metabolites, while beneficial bacteria were positively correlated with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), IL-10, and cognitive behavior. This study highlights the value of SDFs in future diet-based therapeutic strategies targeting gut-brain interactions."

      "abstract": "The novel plant hormone strigolactones (SL) are involved significantly in plant growth and development. Its key members SMXL6, 7, 8 can modulate SL signal reception and response negatively and can regulate plant branching remarkably. There are relatively scarce studies of cotton SMXL gene family, and this study was carried out to clarify the role of GbSMXL8 in cotton fiber development. Phylogenetic analysis identified 48 cotton SMXL genes, which were divided into SMXL-I (SMXL 1, 2), SMXL-II (SMXL 3) and SMXL-III (SMXL6, 7, 8) groups. The results of the cis-element analysis indicated that the SMXL gene could respond to hormones and the environment to modulate cotton growth process. A candidate gene GbSMXL8 was screened out based on the expression difference in extreme varieties of Gossypium barbadense. Tissue-specific analysis indicated that GbSMXL8 was mainly expressed in roots, 20D, 25D, and 35D and was involved in SL signaling pathways. In vitro ovule culture experiments showed that exogenous SLs (GR24) could promote the fiber elongation of G. barbadense, and GbSMXL8 expression was increased after GR24 treatment, indicating that GbSMXL8 was specifically responsive to GR24 in regulating fiber growth. GbSMXL8 knockout resulted in creased length and number of epidermal hairs and the length of fiber, indicating the interference role of GbSMXL8 gene with the development of cotton fiber. The GbSMXL8 transgenic plant was detected with a higher chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rate than those of the control plant, producing a direct impact on plant growth, yield, and biomass accumulation. GbSMXL8 gene knockout could increase plant height, accelerate growth rate, and lengthen fiber length. Intervening GbSMXL8 may mediate cotton growth, plant type formation and fiber elongation. In conclusion, the present study uncovers the function of GbSMXL8-mediated SL signal in cotton, providing theoretical insight for future breeding of new cotton varieties.",

However, improving the mechanical properties of PLA remains a challenge. This study explores the incorporation of chemically treated hemp fibers to improve the interfacial adhesion and mechanical strength of PLA filaments. Samples with PLA and hemp were prepared by subjecting the fibers to cationization treatment with (3-chloro-hydroxypropyl) tri-methylammonium (EPTA) and functionalization with glycidyl methacrylate (GMA). EPTA improves adhesion mainly through surface modification, increasing reactive functional groups in cellulose, while GMA improves interfacial adhesion by forming covalent bonds with both the fiber and PLA and improves the dispersion of the fiber in the matrix. Mechanical properties were evaluated by tensile testing, as well as fracture morphology by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray energy dispersive analysis (EDS). The results showed that the addition of untreated hemp significantly reduced the strength of PLA, but cationization with EPTA improved interfacial adhesion and increased tensile strength by 615%. The combination of treated fibers and GMA further optimized the mechanical properties, reaching values similar to pure PLA. These findings indicate that the chemical modification of natural fibers facilitates their integration into PLA filaments for 3D printing, promoting sustainable materials without compromising mechanical performance."

This study explored different chain-length FPCAs that generated the influence on nitrogen removal in CWs amended with modified basalt fiber bio-nest (CW-BF). Results demonstrated a significant decrease of ammonium (NH4+-N) by 20.65-24.79 % in later stages and a higher nitrate (NO3--N) removal by 3.02-5.21 % during April to August were observed with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) stress. In contrast, there were slighter impacts on both NH4+-N and NO3--N removal by perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA). PFOA suppressed the activity of ammonia monooxygenase and nitrite oxidoreductase, while stimulated nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase. For functional microorganisms, the relative abundance of Ellin6067 decreased by 24.97 % with PFOA treatment, aligned with lower nitrifying enzyme activities and higher effluent NH4+-N concentration. Besides, both PFCAs caused the enrichment of denitrifying bacteria like Plasticicumulans, Denitratisoma, Hassallia, and Azoarcus, according with higher expression of functional genes. Nevertheless, an increase of NH4+-N in the effluent of the PFOA group might result from the up-regulation of genes related to dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium with PFCAs exposure."

A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, identifying randomized controlled trials published in the last five years. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria, evaluating various types of dietary fiber, including soluble, insoluble, viscous fiber, and resistant starch. The findings demonstrated significant improvements in key glycemic markers such as fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and postprandial glucose levels, as well as weight management outcomes such as reductions in body weight and waist circumference. Secondary benefits included improvements in lipid profiles, insulin sensitivity, and gut microbiota composition. The quality assessment revealed a low risk of bias in most studies, ensuring robust evidence. Despite these promising results, gaps in long-term effects and variations in intervention efficacy warrant further research. These findings emphasize the potential of dietary fiber as a practical and accessible intervention in diabetes management and prevention."

      "abstract": "Nitrite, a toxic substance, has been shown to adsorb and reduce organismal damage when natural adsorbents are used. Okara, due to its unique structure and adsorption properties, is one of the most eco-friendly and efficient adsorbents, naturally reducing nitrite-induced biotoxicity without side effects. Consequently, six groups of Kunming (KM) mice (n = 10) were comprehensively evaluated through tests for identifying physicochemical properties and physiological indexes. Additionally, the adsorption effects of high-purity soybean insoluble dietary fiber from Okara (HPSIDF) and hydrochloric acid-modified high-purity soybean insoluble dietary fiber from Okara (HCl-HPSIDF) on nitrite-induced toxicity were explored to ultimately determine their bioavailability potentials. Results indicated a 1.35-fold increase in water-holding capacity, a 1.32-fold increase in oil-holding capacity, and a 1.22-fold increase in water-swelling capacity. These physicochemical properties of HCl-HPSIDF were enhanced to improve the dietary fiber quality. Acid treatment increased HCl-HPSIDF's NO2 -removal rate by 20.87% compared to HPSIDF and enhanced its adsorption capacity by 42.5%. The average particle size of HCl-HPSIDF was reduced by 32.82%, increasing NO2 - contact with its adsorption sites and enhancing adsorption capacity. These improvements in changes in HCl-HPSIDF performance support its use as a natural, side-effect-free adsorbent for nitrite, with acid treatment enhancing dietary fiber functionality and enabling HCl-HPSIDF's application in adsorbents.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This study was designed to explore the relationship between retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and cognition in Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) patients without visual symptoms or diagnosis of dementia. METHODS: Groups of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and healthy controls were compared ophthalmologically using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and cognitively through neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: The findings highlighted a pronounced RNFL thinning, especially in the right nasal inferior quadrant of IPD patients compared to the control group. Almost half (47%) of the subjects in the IPD group exhibited issues in one or multiple subcomponents of Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R). At the same time, the study suggested that effects in the visuospatial domain may be associated with disease severity in IPD patients. However, the investigation could not establish a direct association between the severity or duration of the disease and OCT measurements. A correlation was observed between certain ACE-R scores and some RNFL quadrants. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the inception phases of IPD are characterized by discernable visual pathologies and cognitive anomalies. The thinning of the RNFL, which can be identified through OCT, might serve as a pivotal tool for tracking the early progression of IPD and formulating intervention strategies. That being said, more comprehensive studies are essential to wholly understand OCT's role in the early diagnosis and monitoring of IPD."

This study evaluated the effects of PDT with different photosensitizers on the penetration depth and area of self-adhesive resin cement into dentinal tubules. Forty single-canal, round-shaped lower premolar teeth were prepared using the ProTaper Next system. After root canals were filled with the single cone technique, samples were stored for 7 days. Post spaces were created, and samples were divided into four groups: control, methylene blue (MB), toluidine blue (TB), and Pc groups. PDT was performed using photosensitizers combined with light-emitting diodes (LEDs). 1.0 mm ± 0.1 axial sections were taken from the 1, 5, and 8 mm levels from the orifice. The penetration depth and area of self-adhesive resin cement into dentinal tubules were analyzed using a confocal laser microscope. Statistical analyses were conducted using ANOVA and Tukey's test. Cement penetration depth decreased from coronal to apical sections in all groups. At the 1 mm level, MB showed a greater penetration area than Pc, while at the 5 mm level, MB showed a lower penetration area than the control group (p < 0.05). No significant differences were found at the 8 mm level. This study showed that while adhesive penetration depth did not differ significantly among groups, penetration area varied at 1 mm and 5 mm sections. Methylene blue exhibited a higher penetration area at 1 mm compared to phthalocyanine, whereas toluidine blue showed consistent penetration across sections. In terms of penetration depth and area findings, the findings showed that PC can be used as an alternative photosensitizer in PDT application in endodontics, showing generally similar findings with MB and TB.",

OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the effects of a fiber intervention on hyperphagia, metabolic health, and gut microbiota in individuals with PWS, and explored associations between changes in health markers and shifts in microbiota. METHODS: Participants received either a high-dose fiber intervention (35g/day) or a control for 3 weeks. Following a washout period of 4 to 8 weeks, participants switched treatments for another 3 weeks. Fecal (bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA) and blood (immunometabolic markers, targeted metabolomics) samples were collected before and after each treatment. RESULTS: Fourteen participants (with a median age of 13.6 years, 8 [57.1%] were female) reported high tolerance to the fiber intervention. While it did not significantly alter hyperphagia or key metabolic markers, the fiber intervention led to shifts in gut microbiota diversity and increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium longum and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Additionally, it altered fecal and serum metabolites, including a decrease in branched-chain fatty acids and an increase in serum C4-OH acylcarnitine. CONCLUSION: While this study did not observe significant changes in primary or secondary endpoints, it suggests that a short-term high-fiber intervention may induce beneficial shifts in gut microbiota and microbial metabolites in individuals with PWS. Further research is warranted to investigate the long-term effects and potential therapeutic applications of fiber interventions in PWS."

Our study employs fixel-based analysis (FBA) to examine fiber-specific white matter differences in BD and DD and gain insights into the ability of FBA metrics to predict future spectrum mood symptoms. METHODS: 163 individuals between 18 and 45 years with BD, DD, and healthy controls (HC) underwent Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging. FBA was used to assess fiber density (FD), fiber cross-section (FC), and fiber density cross-section (FDC) in major white matter tracts. A longitudinal follow-up evaluated whether FBA measures predicted future spectrum depressive and hypomanic symptom trajectories over six months. RESULTS: Direct comparisons between BD and DD indicated lower FD in the right superior longitudinal and uncinate fasciculi and left thalamo-occipital tract in BD versus DD. Individuals with DD exhibited lower FD in the left arcuate fasciculus than those with BD. Compared to HC, both groups showed lower FD in the splenium of the corpus callosum and left striato-occipital and optic radiation tracts. FD in these tracts predicted future spectrum symptom severity. Exploratory analyses revealed associations between FD, medication use, and marijuana exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight distinct and overlapping white matter alterations in BD and DD. Furthermore, FD in key tracts may serve as a predictor of future symptom trajectories, supporting the potential clinical utility of FD as a biomarker for mood disorder prognosis. Future longitudinal studies are needed to explore the impact of treatment and disease progression on white matter microstructure."

      "abstract": "Lifestyle interventions, such as diet and exercise, are currently the main therapies against metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). However, not much is known about the combined impact of fiber and exercise on the modulation of gut-liver axis and MASLD amelioration. Here, we studied the impact of the combination of exercise training and a fiber-rich diet on the amelioration of MASLD. Male APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice were fed a high-fat high-cholesterol diet with or without the addition of fiber (10% inulin) and exercise trained on a treadmill, or remained sedentary. Exercise training and fiber supplementation reduced fat mass gain and lowered plasma glucose levels. Only the combination treatment, however, induced fat loss and decreased plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels compared with sedentary control mice. Exercise training with and without the addition of fiber had a similar ameliorating effect on the MASLD score. Only exercise without fiber decreased the hepatic expression of inflammatory markers. Fiber diet was mainly responsible for remodeling the gut microbial composition, with an increase in the relative abundance of the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing genera Anaerostipes and Muribaculaceae, whereas, surprisingly, exercise training alone and with fiber resulted in the highest increase of SCFA production. Overall, the combination of exercise training and dietary fiber decreases fat mass and improves glucose and lipid homeostasis but does not have an additional synergistic positive effect on liver health compared with exercise training alone.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The combination of dietary fiber intake and exercise training has a synergetic beneficial effect on the metabolic health, resulting in fat loss, lowered blood glucose, and lowered plasma lipid levels in mice with steatotic liver disease. However, fiber supplementation, despite a positive remodulation of the gut-liver axis, does not have an additional positive effect on liver health compared with exercise training alone.",

In the control group, 68 cases occurred in the left atrium, 4 cases in the right atrium, and 1 case in bilateral atria. Among the 6 cases in the recurrence group, the recurrence time was 1-7 years, with average 4.8 years. In the univariate analysis of recurrent cardiac myxoma pathology, disruption of elastic fiber layer and tumor cells of the tumor stalk invading into the myocardium through the elastic fiber layer were statistically associated with recurrence of cardiac myxoma (P<0.05). Logistic regression analyses showed that the invasion of tumor cells through the elastic fiber layer of the heart wall into the myocardium was an independent risk factor for recurrence (Odds Ratio=0.999, P<0.05). Conclusion: During the pathologic diagnosis, assessing the relationship between tumor cells in the stalk of cardiac myxoma and elastic fiber layer can help estimate the recurrence risk of cardiac myxoma, and thus guide clinical treatment and postoperative follow-up.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the fracture resistance of immediate and delayed restorations after root canal treatment (RCT). METHODS: Sixty human intact premolar teeth were used. Teeth were prepared disto-occlusally. After RCT, teeth were randomly divided into two groups according to restoration times (immediate or 3 months delayed). The three month delay was imitated by thermomechanical aging. Then, samples were divided into six subgroups (n = 10). While I (Composite resin), II (Flowable bulk-fill) and III (Ribbond+Flowable bulk-fill) were restored immediately, Groups IV, V and VI were restored with temporary filling material and stored in distilled. After subjected to thermo-cycling (2,500 cycles, 5-55 °C) and exposed to 60,000 cycles in a chewing simulator, Group IV (Composite resin), V (Flowable bulk-fill) and VI (Ribbond+Flowable bulk-fill) were restored. All of the teeth were fractured on the universal testing machine. Failure modes were analyzed using scanning electron microscope. Data were analyzed using the Shapiro-Wilk and two-way ANOVA tests (p < 0.05). RESULTS: The highest fracture resistance was recorded in Group III while the lowest in Group VI. No statistically significant difference was observed among groups (p > 0.05). Most of the repairable fractures were seen in Groups I and II. CONCLUSION: Delaying the permanent restorations of teeth for 3 months did not affect fracture resistance. However, it was suggested to avoid delaying restorations for obtaining repairable surfaces.",

Current understanding of the intricate fiber-microbe-disease tripartite relationship remains fragmented and elusive, urging a systematic investigation. Here, we focused on microbiota disturbance as a robust index to mitigate various confounding factors and developed the Bio-taxonomic Hierarchy Weighted Aggregation (BHWA) algorithm to integrate multi-taxonomy microbiota disturbance data, thereby illuminating the complex relationships among dietary fiber, microbiota, and disease. By leveraging microbiota disturbance similarities, we (1) classified 32 types of dietary fibers into six functional subgroups, revealing correlations with fiber solubility; (2) established associations among 161 diseases, uncovering shared microbiota disturbance patterns that explain disease co-occurrence (e.g., type II diabetes and kidney diseases) and distinct microbiota patterns that discern symptomatically similar diseases (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome); (3) designed a body-site-specific microbiota disturbance scoring scheme, computing a disturbance score (DS) for each disease and highlighting the pronounced capacity of Crohn's disease to disturb gut microbiota (DS = 14.01) in contrast with food allergy's minimal capacity (DS = 0.74); (4) identified 1659 fiber-disease associations, predicting the potential of dietary fiber to modulate specific microbiota changes associated with diseases of interest; (5) established murine models of inflammatory bowel disease to validate the preventive and therapeutic effects of arabinoxylan that notably perturbed the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla, as well as the Bacteroidetes and Lactobacillus genera, aligning with our model predictions.

After SMF treatment, the surface of soluble DF showed higher pore density and pore structures, and insoluble DF showed more folds and a concave-convex surface profile. FT-IR and thermogravimetric analyses also showed that SMF pretreatment improved the functional group structure and thermal stability of DFs in corn sprouts. Moreover, SMF pretreatment improved the inhibitory effects on α-amylase and α-glucosidase activities, as well as increased water holding, oil holding, and water swelling capacities. Compared to the untreated corn sprouts, the DF obtained from SMF treatment exhibited stronger antioxidant activity. In summary, these findings suggest that SMF pretreatment enhances the physicochemical and functional properties of DF derived from corn sprouts.

Herein, a microporous metal-organic framework (MOF) material namely Ca-TCPB [H4TCPB: 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)-benzene] with three-dimensional (3D) structure was synthesized via simple solvothermal method. The Ca-TCPB served as fiber coating of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) to extract and enrich PAHs prior to gas chromatography analysis. The results showed that the established method has a wide linear range (0.005-40 ng⋅mL-1), high coefficient of determination (R2>0.9961), low detection limit (0.0017-0.003 ng⋅mL-1), and high enrichment factor (7504-13,932), respectively. In addition, the analytical method was successful detected trace target PAHs in pond water with recoveries in the range of 83.3-114.1 %. The excellent extraction ability of this Ca-TCPB crystalline material for target PAHs can be attributed to strong interactions between Ca-TCPB and PAHs, including π-π stacking interactions and hydrogen bonding interactions. It was shown that Ca-TCPB material as fiber coating material possessed the merits of facile and eco-friendly synthesis process, high enrichment multiples, superior thermal stability (470 °C), and high number of reuse times (75 times). Furthermore, the biocompatible Ca-TCPB is alternative material that are green, safe and sustainable. Therefore, the innovative use of Ca-TCPB material as a fiber coating for HP-SPME in this work opens new horizons for sample preparation and environmental analysis.",

AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different GFP systems on BS to intraradicular dentin using two dual-curing resin cement types. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Thirty bovine incisors with wide canals were filled endodontically with gutta-percha and epoxy resin sealer. Initially, the canal filling was removed, and 4 mm of the apical seal was left intact. The teeth were divided into three groups according to the GFPs used: AP (anatomical posts - prefabricated GFP (Reforpost #2, Angelus®) relined with composite resin (Filtek Z350, 3M ESPE); SPLENDOR (Splendor SAP, Angelus®), and milled CAD/CAM (FiberCAD, Angelus®). Posts were fixed with conventional (RelyX Ultimate, 3M ESPE) or self-adhesive resin cement (RC) (RelyX U200, 3M ESPE), following the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, the roots were sectioned into thirds and subjected to pushout BS testing using a universal testing machine. BS data were analyzed using Wilcoxon and Mann- Whitney U tests. Failure modes were assessed with Fisher's Exact test (α=0.05). RESULTS: In the apical and middle root sections, BS was similar in the AP and Splendor groups, both of which performed better than the milled CAD/CAM group (p≤0.05). In the cervical section, BS was significantly higher for the anatomical posts than for Splendor and milled CAD/CAM posts. Self-adhesive RC promoted statistically lower BS compared to conventional RC for the milled CAD/CAM post in the cervical and middle thirds (p≤0.05). Self-adhesive RC provided statistically higher bond strength than conventional RC for the anatomical post in the apical third (p≤0.05). No significant difference in failure modes was observed between resin cements and different root sections (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: The BS of the GFP system was affected by resin cement type and root section, with composite resin-relined anatomically shaped posts generally performing better.",

      "abstract": "Optical fiber radioluminescence (RL) dosimetry has gained prominence in modern radiation therapy, offering real-time measurement and high spatial resolution. Our research group has developed a system utilizing a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) transmission fiber coupled with a photodetector and various scintillators, including doped silica fibers. A critical challenge in RL dosimetry lies in distinguishing the stem signal, generated by the transmission optical fiber, from the primary light signal produced by the RL sensor. To address this issue, we employed the Geant4 simulation tool, allowing for the simultaneous tracking of ionizing radiation and optical photons. In this study, the Geant4-based code, TOPAS, was utilized to conduct Monte Carlo simulations, aiming to gain insights into the radioluminescence signal in an optical fiber RL dosimeter and specifically characterize the stem signal for enhanced measurement accuracy. The simulations encompassed interactions of a medical photon beam from an Elekta linac within a solid water phantom, subsequent energy deposition within the RL sensor, and the generation and transmission of light signals within the optical fiber. Our emphasis was placed on detailed characterization of the light signals originating from both the Ge-doped silica fiber and PMMA transmission fiber. The primary focus was not only to discern the stem signal from the main signal but also to differentiate between the fluorescence and Cerenkov signals. Importantly, our study showcases how Monte Carlo simulations can be used to spectrally distinguish the stem signal from the scintillation signal of the sensor. This provides valuable information, especially in scenarios where spectrometry is unavailable, contributing to the understanding and refinement of optical fiber RL dosimetry systems.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide. It has been demonstrated that there is a correlation between the increase in bacterial abundance and the severity of certain symptoms associated with PD. Aim: the aim of this pilot study was to analyze the effect of supplementation with prebiotic fiber on the gut microbiota (GM) and nutritional status of elderly volunteers with Parkinson's disease. Methodology: this is a pilot study of pre and post intervention with prebiotic fiber. All subjects involved were volunteers with PD, who were given nutritional counseling and gut microbiota measured on time cero and after 30 days of prebiotic fiber intervention. Results: a statistically significant difference was found in calf circumference (p 0.0422) after the intervention with prebiotic fiber. GM analyses show an initial difference in gut bacterial abundance of older people with PD and people without PD. Furthermore, our results showed a difference in bacterial families and genera after the supplementation with prebiotic fiber. in addition, we found a statistically significant difference in the val-ue of circumference calf and a trend in the improvement of body weight, Body mass index (BMI), neck circumference, arm circumference, brachial area, and Diet Quality Questionnaire (DQQ) for older adults. Conclusion: supplementation with 20 g of prebiotic fiber for 30 days could modify the intestinal microbiota, reducing bacterial genera and phylum that are abundant in Park-inson's disease, such as Verrucomicrobia. Therefore, the use of prebiotic fiber could represent an alternative to improve intestinal health and nutritional status of people with Parkinson's disease.",

      "abstract": "In this study, a surface treatment process was introduced into the conventional dispersion process for preparing wet-laid nonwoven fabrics to improve their properties, using recycled carbon fibers (rCFs). The conventional binder solution was replaced with a solution containing different amounts of silane, and the changes in the fiber properties of the prepared nonwoven fabrics were examined after the addition of modified rCFs and polypropylene. FE-SEM analysis confirmed that a silane layer was formed on the rCF surface due to the formation of a siloxane network. FT-IR and XPS analyses further confirmed the presence of siloxane bonds and chemical modification of the rCF surface. When an optimal amount of silane content was used, the mechanical strength increased by 64% compared to untreated rCFs, owing to the improved molecular chain entanglement within the matrix. Our findings indicate that the simultaneous use of dispersion and a surface treatment can produce composites with excellent mechanical properties and improved processing and surface properties; thus, this method can be used to help upcycle rCFs, thereby expanding their applications."

Compelling evidence suggests that COVID-19 increases symptoms of pre-existent small fiber neuropathy (SFN) and might trigger de novo onset of SFN. In this systematic review, for the first time, we provide a comprehensive overview of the clinical and diagnostic features of PASC-SFN, including the accompanying disorders, disease evolution, and possible treatments, described in the recent literature. Following infection, many patients reported a wide range of symptoms and complications, not self-limiting and independent from previous infection severity. SFN begins more frequently with distal limb burning pain and numbness, which accompany other dysautonomia, cognitive, visual, and osteoarticular disorders involving multiple organ systems. In an initial diagnostic suspicion, some tests might be useful as complementary examinations, such as nerve quantitative sensory testing, electromyography, and optic nerve tomography. Otherwise, definite diagnosis is reached with skin biopsy as the gold standard, along with corneal in vivo microscopy when ocular discomfort is present. Being a long-term condition, multiple and dissimilar symptomatic and disease-modifying drugs were employed for the treatment of this condition with the achievement of partial results, including steroids, pregabalin, gabapentin, duloxetine, vitamins, homotaurine and phosphatidylserine, alpha lipoic acid, immunosuppressants, and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. PASC-SFN is a complex emerging disease and extremely challenging for physicians. At present, the only feasible management of PASC-SFN is represented by a multidisciplinary tailored approach, with future definitive protocols for diagnosis and treatment deemed essential."

However, scaffolds are subject to a wide range of challenges, including mechanical, degradation, process-related and biological requirements. Poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) fibers have already shown potential for tendon tissue engineering (TTE) because of their degradation kinetics and excellent mechanical properties. The objective of this study was to enhance the PCL scaffold for TTE, specifically in regard to the filament morphology and collagen coating. PCL fibers were melt-spun as monofilaments with circular and snowflake-shaped cross-sections. Different scaffold densities were achieved by applying three different braiding angles in the braiding process. Morphological characterization was conducted including porosity and pore size distribution using µ-CT. The scaffolds were collagenized and cellularized with primary tenocytes for 7 days. Immunofluorescence staining showed a certain alignment of cell growing direction with fiber direction. In cell viability and cell proliferation assays, significant improvements in cell response were observed for the snowflake fiber and collagen coating groups, especially when combined. The data suggest that the utilization of non-circular fibers may facilitate enhanced cell guidance and surface area, while the application of a collagen coating could optimize the cellular environment for adhesion and proliferation.",

      "abstract": "Current standard of care treatment for patients with spine tumors includes multidisciplinary approaches, including the following: (1) surgical tumor debulking, epidural spinal cord decompression, and spine stabilization techniques; (2) systemic chemo/targeted therapies; (3) radiation therapy; and (4) surveillance imaging for local disease control and recurrence. Titanium pedicle screw and rod fixation have become commonplace in the spine surgeon's armamentarium for the stabilization of the spine following tumor resection and separation surgery. However, the high degree of imaging artifacts seen with titanium implants on postoperative CT and MRI scans can significantly hinder the accurate delineation of vertebral anatomy and adjacent neurovascular structures to allow for the safe and effective planning of downstream radiation therapies and detection of disease recurrence. Carbon fiber-reinforced polyetheretherketone (CFR-PEEK) spine implants have emerged as a promising alternative to titanium due to the lack of artifact signals on CT and MRI, allowing for more accurate and safe postoperative radiation planning. In this article, we review the tenants of the surgical and radiation management of spine tumors and discuss the safety, efficacy, and current limitations of CFR-PEEK spine implants in the multidisciplinary management of spine oncology patients."

      "abstract": "Emerging evidence supports the beneficial effects of dietary fiber supplementation in alleviating gut dysbiosis, which leads to a reduction in uremic toxins and inflammatory markers in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. However, current evidence-based renal nutrition guidelines do not provide recommendations regarding dietary fiber intake. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate and highlight the effects of dietary fiber supplementation on modulating uremic toxins and inflammatory markers in individuals with CKD, with or without dialysis. The eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials until 27 November 2024. The results were synthesized using a random-effects model and presented as standardized mean differences (SMDs) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). A total of 21 studies with 700 patients were included. When compared with the control group, dietary fiber supplementation ranging from 6 to 50 g/day, for typically more than 4 weeks, could significantly reduce the levels of serum uremic toxins, including p-cresyl sulfate, indoxyl sulfate, and blood urea nitrogen (SMD -0.22, -0.34, -0.25, respectively, with p-values < 0.05), as well as biomarkers of inflammation, including interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (SMD -0.44, -0.34, respectively, with p-values < 0.05). These beneficial effects were consistent across different types of fibers and CKD status (with or without dialysis). However, no significant reduction in serum trimethylamine N-oxide, uric acid, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels was observed with dietary fiber intervention. This study would pave the way for prioritizing dietary quality, particularly a fiber-rich diet, beyond the traditional focus on the quantities of protein, energy, and electrolyte restrictions among individuals with CKD.",

      "abstract": "Microbial short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) regulate intestinal functions via free-fatty acid (FFA) receptors type 2 and 3. Though the caecum is the most important fermentation chamber in many species, it is unknown whether this signaling system is modulated in dependence on the rate of fermentation within the lumen of this part of the large intestine. Thus, we asked the question whether alteration of the microbiota composition by antibiotic treatment or high-fiber diet affects the SCFA/FFA signaling using rat caecum as model system. SCFA concentrations and microbiota were analyzed in caecal samples from untreated rats, following vancomycin treatment, or after feeding with a high-fiber diet. Oral and aboral caecal segments were harvested for Ussing chamber experiments paralleled by Ca2+ imaging experiments with Fura-2 loaded crypts, immunofluorescence, and qPCR. Vancomycin treatment reduced total SCFA concentrations in the caecal content, whereas the high-fiber diet increased the concentration of acetate, but reduced that of propionate and butyrate. Propionate-induced anion secretion was abolished in the vancomycin group, whereas it nearly doubled in the high-fiber group. These effects could not be explained by changes in the expression of FFA2 receptor or in Ca2+ signaling evoked by FFA2 receptor activation. Parallel changes in ion secretion evoked by carbachol suggest that alterations in cholinergic signaling might be responsible for the observed changes in epithelial ion transport. Additionally, mucosal mast cell and enterochromaffin cell density increased after vancomycin and high-fiber diet, respectively. This study emphasizes the complex interactions between the microbiota and the caecal epithelium focusing on SCFA/FFA signaling.",

      "abstract": "Rationale: The inflammatory microenvironment and resulting neuronal loss following spinal cord injury (SCI) impede the repair process. Endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs), which are constrained by neuroinflammation and slow differentiation rates, are unable to effectively facilitate recovery. Method: In this study, coaxial electrospinning technology was employed to fabricate a nano-fiber/net artificial bionic dura mater (NABDM). This structure featured a core-shell structure, with nafamostat mesylate (NM) encapsulated in the outer layer of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and neurotrophins-3 (NT3) encapsulated in the inner layer of poly (l-lactic acid) (PLLA). Results: The NABDM modifies the polarization direction of microglia in vitro, and promotes the differentiation of NSCs by activating the cGMP-PKG and cAMP signaling pathways. In a mouse SCI model, NABDM effectively reduces local neuroinflammation, accelerates the differentiation of endogenous NSCs, increases the number of mature neurons, and enhances motor, sensory, and autonomic nerve functions in mice. Conclusion: NABDM promotes the differentiation of NSCs and facilitates the repair of SCI in a time sequence external-oral way. This approach represents a rapid and effective new treatment method.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the effect of root dentin pretreatment with different concentrations of chitosan on the push-out bond strength (PBS) of fiber post using a self-adhesive resin cement. METHODS: After post-space preparation in 56 maxillary central incisors that underwent endodontic treatment and were filled with gutta-percha (Spident, Korea) and AH Plus resin sealer (Dentsply, USA), the teeth were randomly divided into four groups (n = 14) for pretreatment with 2.5% chitosan, 1% chitosan, 17% ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA), and saline. Fiber posts were cemented into the root canals using Panavia SA resin cement. The teeth were then thermocycled (5°C-55°C, 5,000 cycles), and the roots were sectioned into coronal, middle, and apical thirds. The PBS was measured in a universal testing machine. The mode of failure was also determined under a stereomicroscope and a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The PBS data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc test. RESULTS: The mean PBS of 2.5% chitosan group was significantly higher than that of control group at the coronal, middle, and apical thirds of the root in the post-placement region. However, 2.5% chitosan group had a significant difference in PBS with the EDTA group only in the middle and coronal thirds (P < 0.05). Pretreatment with 1% chitosan and 17% EDTA did not significantly increase the PBS at any level from the root in the post-placement region. Cohesive failure was dominant in 2.5% chitosan group, while mixed failure had the highest frequency in other groups. CONCLUSION: Root dentin pretreatment with 2.5% chitosan improved the PBS of fiber post to root dentin by using a self-adhesive resin cement.",

      "abstract": "In this research, natural fibers such as Abelmoschus Mallow (AM) and Bambusa vulgaris (BV), vegetable waste filler powder (VWP) from Ipomoea batatas were extracted with cellulose. The derived fibers were chemically treated using NaOH (3-8 wt%) to enhance the fiber properties. High cellulose content of 60.42 % (AM) and 53.71 % (BV) was observed with treatment up to 3 wt%. Tensile strength (TS) increased from 163.4 to 186.5 MPa in AM fibers and 173.1 to 199.5 MPa in BV natural fibers after the chemical treatment. However, treatment with a higher concentration of NaOH (5 wt%) declined the properties and caused deformation in fibers. These fibers and filler were incorporated with the PLA matrix. The incorporation of AM in PLA reduces the TS from 56.88 to 50.89 MPa up to 20 wt% addition. Furthermore, high compression pressure (14 MPa) during fabrication caused deformation in hybrid composites that lags TS. The VWP binds the hybrid natural fiber combination by reducing the gap between fibers and matrix, improving the Flexural Strength (FS) up to 4 wt%. Treatment and fiber addition positively influence the hydrophilic nature of polymer composites.",
