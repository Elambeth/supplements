      "abstract": "Warming seawater temperatures and low dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) levels are environmental stressors that affect the health and abundance of marine macroalgae and their microbiomes. Nereocystis luetkeana, a canopy-forming species of brown algae that forms critical habitat along the Pacific coast, has declined in regions impacted by these synergistic stressors. Little is known about how these environmental factors affect the microbiome of N. luetkeana, which could affect nutrient availability, vitamin production, and stress response for the host. We experimentally tested the interactive effects of three seawater temperatures (13°C, 16°C, 21°C) crossed with abundant and replete DIN levels on the diversity and composition of blade-associated microbiomes from two spatially separated kelp host populations. We hypothesised that kelp microbiomes exposed to high temperatures and low DIN would experience the lowest diversity. Contrary to our hypothesis, the highest temperature treatment resulted in the largest increase in microbial diversity, and microbiomes in all temperature treatments experienced a decrease in previously dominant taxa. Temperature had a larger effect than DIN on the kelp microbiome in all cases. The disruption to the kelp microbiome across all temperatures, especially at the highest temperature, suggests that the effects of warming on N. luetkeana extend to the microbiome.",

      "abstract": "This study innovatively utilized kelp-derived nanocellulose and sodium caseinate (SC) to prepare fucoxanthin (Fx)-loaded nanoparticles, exploring their efficacy in reducing oxidative stress and inhibiting lipid accumulation. 2, 2, 6, 6-Tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO)-mediated oxidation produced well-dispersed, kelp-derived nanocellulose. When these celluloses were mixed with SC at varying mass ratios, the composite nanoparticles showed excellent stability. Specifically, at a TEMPO-oxidized kelp nanocellulose (TKNC) to SC mass ratio of 1:3, the encapsulation efficiency for Fx reached 82.2 %, with a retention of 56.12 % after 14 days of storage. In vitro, the nanoparticles demonstrated good biocompatibility and were efficiently absorbed by cells, significantly enhancing Fx bioavailability. This enhanced delivery efficiency alleviates oxidative stress by activating the Nrf2/HO-1/NQO1 signaling pathways and effectively inhibits lipid droplet formation induced by excessive free fatty acids (FFAs). Moreover, distribution studies in mice revealed effective accumulation of nanoparticles in the intestines and liver, indicating their potential for targeted drug delivery. These findings provide strong experimental support for the use of TKNC and SC as biocompatible materials in nanoparticles for drug delivery and treatment applications.",

      "abstract": "Fjord systems in the Norwegian Arctic are experiencing an increasing frequency and magnitude of marine heatwaves. These episodic heat stress events can have varying degrees of acute impacts on primary production and nutrient uptake of mixed kelp communities, as well as modifying the biogeochemical cycling in nearshore systems where vast areas of kelp create structural habitat. To assess the impact of future marine heatwaves on kelp communities, we conducted a 23 day mesocosm experiment exposing mixed kelp communities to warming and heatwave scenarios projected for the year 2100. Three treatments were considered: a constant warming (+1.8°C from the control), a medium magnitude and long duration heatwave event (+2.8°C from the control for 13 days), and two short-term, more intense, heatwaves(5 day long scenarios with temperature peaks at +3.9°C from the control). The results show that both marine heatwave treatments reduced net community production, whereas the constant warm temperature treatment displayed no difference from the control. The long marine heatwave scenario resulted in reduced accumulated net community production, indicating that prolonged exposure had a greater severity than two high magnitude, short-term heatwave events. We estimated an 11°C temperature threshold at which negative effects to primary production appeared present. We highlight that marine heatwaves can induce sublethal effects on kelp communities by depressing net community production. These results are placed in the context of potential physiological resilience of kelp communities and implications of reduced net community production to future Arctic fjord environmental conditions."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Taste decline, including taste loss in older adults, leads to malnutrition and frailty. In a super-aging society, improving taste decline and maintaining taste sensation are crucial for the wellbeing of older adults. Hyposalivation frequently affects older individuals and is the leading cause of taste decline in older adults. Treating taste decline, including taste loss, in older adults presents challenges due to the limited sustainable methods for increasing saliva production, except for drug therapy, which may lead to adverse effects. Umami-taste stimulation results in a prolonged increase in both the whole salivary flow rate (WF), more than 90% of which is secreted from the major salivary glands, and the minor salivary gland flow rate (MF) in healthy volunteers through the umami-taste salivary reflex. We hypothesized that umami-rich kelp dashi liquid (KDL), commonly used in Japanese cuisine, may alleviate taste decline and sustain normal taste sensation in older adults with hyposalivation. This study investigated whether KDL stimulation could improve taste decline. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A non-randomized controlled trial was conducted at the dental department of a university hospital, involving those who presented with dry mouth between May 2017 and December 2021. Before and after repeated KDL stimulation, characteristics like changes in WF and MF, the recognition thresholds (RTs) for five basic tastes, and subjective eating and swallowing difficulties were assessed. Statistical comparisons were performed between the values measured before and after KDL stimulation. RESULT: A total of 35 older patients were included. Patients with reduced MF and with or without reduced WF exhibited umami-taste loss. Repeated stimulation with KDL increased MF and WF and improved taste loss, including umami, decreased RTs, and normalized each taste. Furthermore, subjective taste impairment, subjective eating and swallowing difficulties, and burning sensations in the oral mucosa were alleviated. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that KDL stimulation improved umami-taste loss and normalized each taste sensation, further alleviating eating difficulties via the umami-taste salivary reflex. Importantly, umami-taste loss was also observed in patients with normal WF but decreased MF, who are typically not diagnosed with hyposalivation. Therefore, KDL has the potential to sustain taste sensations and promote healthy eating habits in older individuals."

      "abstract": "Three experiments were performed investigating bovine enteric methane (CH4) production inhibition using a proprietary kelp blend product (PKBP) containing a halogenated methane analog (i.e., bromoform). Calves were fed a corn-silage basal diet top-dressed with the assigned treatment, with rations provided at 1.5 × NEm in Experiments 1 and 2 (n = 12 and 6 steers, respectively) and ad libitum in Experiment 3 (n = 9 steers). In Experiment 1, we evaluated bromoform's potency in decreasing CH4. Dry matter intake (DMI) was not affected by treatment (p ≥ 0.11; 0 vs. 52.5 ± 10.5 ppm bromoform), whereas bromoform supplementation decreased CH4 (p < 0.01). In Experiments 2 and 3, treatments were 0, 9.5 ± 1.5, or 20 ± 3 ppm bromoform. In Experiment 2, we examined CH4 recovery following bromoform removal from the ration. Bromoform treatments were fed on d1, but not the subsequent 8 d, to investigate residual effects. On d1, CH4 was below limits of detection for 20 ppm bromoform inclusion. Across days, a cubic response (p < 0.01) was observed with 20 ppm bromoform inclusion, but not with 0 and 9.5 ppm inclusion levels. Experiment 3 (30 d finishing trial) tested bromoform effects on feeder calves. DMI (p = 0.53), average daily gain (p = 0.55), and gain:feed (p = 0.82) were not influenced by bromoform inclusion. Bromoform residues were undetectable in liver, kidney, adipose, and muscle samples collected at harvest. These experiments demonstrated that cattle fed PKBP experience short-term reductions in CH4 without tissue accumulation of bromoform and without evidence of effects on animal growth or feed consumption."

      "abstract": "Alginate is derived from brown algae, which can be cultivated in large quantities. It can be broken down by alginate lyase into alginate oligosaccharides (AOSs), which exhibit a higher added value and better bioactivity than alginate. In this study, metagenomic technology was used to screen for genes that code for high-efficiency alginate lyases. The candidate alginate lyase gene alg169 was detected from Psychromonas sp. SP041, the most abundant species among alginate lyase bacteria on selected rotten kelps. The alginate lyase Alg169 was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), Ni-IDA-purified, and characterized. The optimum temperature and pH of Alg169 were 25 °C and 7.0, respectively. Metal ions including Mn2+, Co2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Ni2+, and Ba2+ led to significantly increased enzyme activity. Alg169 exhibited a pronounced dependence on Na+, and upon treatment with Mn2+, its activity surged by 687.57%, resulting in the highest observed enzyme activity of 117,081 U/mg. Bioinformatic analysis predicted that Alg169 would be a double-domain lyase with a molecular weight of 65.58 kDa. It is a bifunctional enzyme with substrate specificity to polyguluronic acid (polyG) and polymannuronic acid (polyM). These results suggest that Alg169 is a promising candidate for the efficient manufacturing of AOSs from brown seaweed.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dietary kelp possesses a variety of useful biological qualities but does not have a toxic effect on the host. In this study, we examine how kelp dietary supplementation enhances the serum biochemistry, intestinal immunity, and metabolism of hybrid snakehead. A total of 810 juvenile hybrid snakeheads (Channa maculata ♀ × Channa argus ♂), with an initial average weight of 11.4 ± 0.15 g, were allocated randomly to three treatment groups (three replicates per group). The fish were fed for 60 days with isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets. The groups were the control group (C) (20% high-gluten flour), the medium replacement group (MR) (10% high-gluten flour and 10% kelp meal), and the full replacement group (FR) (0% high-gluten flour and 15% kelp meal). RESULTS: The results showed that dietary kelp increased the activity of serum antioxidant enzymes significantly and decreased the content of serum malondialdehyde (MDA) in hybrid snakeheads, with significant changes in the FR group (P < 0.05). The intestinal morphology results showed that dietary kelp helped to increase the specific surface area of intestinal villi, which was beneficial for intestinal digestion and absorption. According to transcriptome and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis, dietary kelp can improve the expression of intestinal immunity and metabolism-related pathways. Among them, immune-related genes MHC1 and HSPA1 were significantly up-regulated, and IGH, MHC2, and IL-8 were significantly down-regulated (P < 0.05). Lipid metabolism-related genes DGAT2, FABP2, RXRα, and PLPP1 were all significantly up-regulated (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Dietary kelp can effectively improve the antioxidant function of hybrid snakeheads, improve intestinal morphology, reduce intestinal inflammation, and promote intestinal lipid synthesis and transportation, thereby improving intestinal immunity and metabolic functions. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "Arctic fjords are considered to be one of the ecosystems changing most rapidly in response to climate change. In the Svalbard archipelago, fjords are experiencing a shift in environmental conditions due to the Atlantification of Arctic waters and the retreat of sea-terminating glaciers. These environmental changes are predicted to facilitate expansion of large, brown macroalgae, into new ice-free regions. The potential resilience of macroalgal benthic communities in these fjord systems will depend on their response to combined pressures from freshening due to glacial melt, exposure to warmer waters, and increased turbidity from meltwater runoff which reduces light penetration. Current predictions, however, have a limited ability to elucidate the future impacts of multiple-drivers on macroalgal communities with respect to ecosystem function and biogeochemical cycling in Arctic fjords. To assess the impact of these combined future environmental changes on benthic productivity and resilience, we conducted a two-month mesocosm experiment exposing mixed kelp communities to three future conditions comprising increased temperature (+ 3.3 and + 5.3°C), seawater freshening by ∼ 3.0 and ∼ 5.0 units (i.e., salinity of 30 and 28, respectively), and decreased photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, - 25 and - 40 %). Exposure to these combined treatments resulted in non-significant differences in short-term productivity, and a tolerance of the photosynthetic capacity across the treatment conditions. We present the first robust estimates of mixed kelp community production in Kongsfjorden and place a median compensation irradiance of ∼12.5 mmol photons m-2 h-1 as the threshold for positive net community productivity. These results are discussed in the context of ecosystem productivity and biological tolerance of kelp communities in future Arctic fjord systems.",

Compared to untreated KP, HPP-treated KP yielded a 1.31-fold increase in water holding capacity (600 MPa/5 min), a 0.12-fold increase in swelling capacity (450 MPa/10 min), a 1.33-fold increase in oil holding capacity (600 MPa/10 min), a 10-fold increase in glucose adsorption capacity (450 MPa/10 min), and a 0.22-fold increase in cholesterol adsorption capacity (163.1 mg/g DW at 450 MPa/10 min), and exhibited good Cd (Ⅱ) adsorption capacity when its concentration was 10 mmol/L in the small intestine. The physicochemical properties of HPP-treated KS were not improved due to its low specific surface area. In addition, HPP treatment efficiently reduced the particle size of KP and increased its total and soluble dietary fiber content by 17% and 63% at 600 MPa/10 min, respectively. Scanning electron microscope micrographs demonstrated that the surface of HPP-treated KP was rough and porous, and the specific surface area increased with increasing pressure and processing time. To conclude, the results obtained in the present study suggest that HPP is a promising processing method for improving the functionality and structural characteristics of KP and provide a theoretical basis for the utilization of HPP-treated KP as a fiber-rich ingredient in the functional food industry."

      "abstract": "Sea urchins can cause extensive damage to kelp forests, and their overgrazing can create extensive barren areas, leading to a loss of biodiversity. Barrens may persist when the recruitment of kelp, which occurs through the microscopic haploid gametophyte stage, is suppressed. However, the ecology of kelp gametophytes is poorly understood, and here we investigate if grazing by juvenile urchins on kelp gametophytes can suppress kelp recruitment and if this is exacerbated by climate change. We compared grazing of Ecklonia radiata gametophytes by two species of juvenile urchins, the tropical Tripneustes gratilla and the temperate Centrostephanus rodgersii, at winter (19°C), summer (23°C), and ocean warming (26°C) temperatures for the low-latitude range edge of E. radiata, which is vulnerable to ocean warming. We examined the rate of recovery of gametophytes following grazing and determined whether they survived and formed sporophytes after ingestion by sea urchins. Both T. gratilla and C. rodgersii grazed E. radiata gametophytes, reducing their abundance compared to no grazing controls. Surprisingly, temperature did not influence grazing rates, but gametophytes did not recover from grazing in the ocean warming (26°C) treatment. Gametophytes survived ingestion by both species of sea urchin and formed sporophytes after ingestion by T. gratilla, but not C. rodgersii. These results suggest complex grazer-gametophyte interactions, in which both negative (reduced abundance and poor recovery with warming) and positive (facilitated recruitment) effects are possible. Small grazers may play a more important role in kelp ecosystem function than previously thought and should be considered in our understanding of alternate stable states.",

      "abstract": "Graceful kelp crabs (Pugettia gracilis) are abundant consumers in shallow subtidal ecosystems of the Salish Sea. These dynamic habitats are currently experiencing multiple changes including invasion by non-native seaweeds and ocean warming. However, little is known about P. gracilis' foraging ecology, therefore we investigated their feeding preferences between native and invasive food sources, as well as feeding rates at elevated temperatures to better assess their role in changing coastal food webs. To quantify crab feeding preferences, we collected P. gracilis from San Juan Island, WA and conducted no-choice and choice experiments with two food sources: the native kelp, Nereocystis luetkeana, and the invasive seaweed, Sargassum muticum. In no-choice experiments, P. gracilis ate equal amounts of N. luetkeana and S. muticum. However, in choice experiments, P. gracilis preferred N. luetkeana over S. muticum. To test effects of temperature on these feeding rates, we exposed P. gracilis to ambient (11.5 ± 1.3 °C) or elevated (19.5 ± 1.8 °C) temperature treatments and measured consumption of the preferred food type, N. luetkeana. Crabs exposed to elevated temperatures ate significantly more than those in the ambient treatment. Our study demonstrates the diet flexibility of P. gracilis, suggesting they may be able to exploit increasing populations of invasive S. muticum in the Salish Sea. Warming ocean temperatures may also prompt P. gracilis to increase feeding, exacerbating harmful impacts on N. luetkeana, which is already vulnerable to warming and invasive competitors.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: The study uses a probiotic-mixture of Lactobacillus reuteri, Pediococcus pentosaceus, and Lactobacillus acidophilus strains for kelp fermentation. KMF, KMFS, and KMFP prevent D-galactose-induced elevation of malondialdehyde levels in serum and brain tissue of aging mice, and they increase superoxide dismutase and catalase levels and total antioxidant capacity. Furthermore, they improve the cell structure of mouse brain, liver, and intestinal tissue. Compared with the model control group, the KMF, KMFS, and KMFP treatments regulate mRNA and protein levels of genes associated with aging, the concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid in the three treatment groups are more than 1.4-, 1.3-, and 1.2-fold increased, respectively. Furthermore, the treatments affect the gut microbiota community structures. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that KMF, KMFS, and KMFP can modulate gut microbiota imbalances and positively affect aging-related genes to achieve anti-aging effects.",

      "abstract": "Kelp forests, among the most productive ecosystems on Earth, cover large areas of the South Atlantic coast. Sediment heterotrophic bacteria have a pivotal role in the degradation of kelp biomass, however, the response of sediment microbial communities to periodic kelp biomass inputs is mostly unknown. Here, we show that kelp biomass induced rapid changes in overlying water chemistry and shifts in sediment microbial communities, which differed in the experimental systems containing Macrocystis pyrifera (M) and Undaria pinnatifida (U) with sediments of the respective regions. We observed results compatible with the degradation of labile, high molecular weight compounds into smaller and more refractory compounds towards the end of the incubations. The capability of microbial communities to degrade alginate, the major component of kelp cell walls, significantly increased with respect to controls after kelp biomass addition (Absorbance at 235 nm 1.2 ± 0.3 and 1.0 ± 0.2 for M and U, respectively, controls <0.2, t = 4 days). Shifts in microbial community structure (based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) were tightly related to the kelp treatment and, to a lesser extent, to the sediment provenance (Principal Coordinates Analysis, 80 % of variation explained in the first two axes). Dissolved oxygen, pH, salinity, alginolytic potential, Absorbance at 235 and 600 nm, total N, total C, and SUVA index correlated significantly with community structure. Differentially abundant populations between kelp-amended treatments and controls included members of the Flavobacteriia class (Algibacter and Polaribacter), and Gammaproteobacteria (Psychromonas and Marinomonas), among others. Metagenomes of M and U-amended sediments contained sequences from 18 of the 19 enzyme families related to alginate or fucoidan degradation. Specific taxonomic groups were associated with enzyme classes targeting different substrates, suggesting niche differentiation. This work expands our knowledge on the patterns of microbial assemblages from intertidal sediments in response to kelp biomass inputs.",

      "abstract": "Kelp powder, supplemented with a dairy cow diet, effectively improved the milk polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) content. However, little information exists on the downstream effects of the kelp-treated milk on body health, gut microbiota, and nutrient metabolism. For this purpose, 48 3-week old Kunming (KM) male mice with an average body weight of 16.1 g ± 0.2 g were randomly divided into the control treatment (CON, fed with standard chow), the common milk supplement treatment (Milk), and the kelp powder-treated milk supplement treatment (KPM). The experiment lasted for 35 days, with a 7-day long adaptive period and a 28-day long main trial. Phenotypic parameters including growth performances and serum lipids-related parameters were first measured, and results indicated that Milk and KPM supplement significantly promoted the total body weight gain (P < 0.05), while significantly decreasing the feed conversion ratio compared with CON (P < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in the blood lipids content among all three treatments, however, the triglyceride content showed a decreasing trend after KPM supplement treatment. Further, activities of liver lipometabolic-related enzymes were investigated to determine the underlying factors that impacted physiological lipid metabolism. KPM treatment showed a significant reductive effect on the activity of lipogenesis-related enzymes, such as FAS and ACC, while a significant stimulative effect on the activity of lipolysis-related enzymes included the ATGL and CPT1 compared with CON (P < 0.05). Finally, gastrointestinal tract development and cecal microbiota community that correlated with body lipid degradation and absorption were measured to determine the underlying mechanism of KPM supplementation on physiological lipid metabolism. Results indicated that supplementation with KPM significantly enhanced cecal bacteria diversity which was reflected in the significant increase of Chao1 and ACE indexes. Besides, starch-degraded bacteria such as Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcaceae, and Streptococcus are significant decreased (P < 0.05), while cellulose-degraded bacteria including Parabacteroides, Prevotella, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, and Bifidobacterium are significantly increased (P < 0.05) after KPM supplement, which may further restrict the energy generation and therefore reduce the lipid deposition. In summary, kelp supplement helped increase the milk PUFAs content, enhance the bacterial diversity and relative abundances of probiotics, which finally modulated physiological lipid metabolism, and promote growth performances."

In this study, the effects of preservation processes on quality aspects of Saccharina latissima products were assessed. First, a blanching (100 °C for 1 or 3 min) treatment was used to produce seaweed salad. In a second study, effects of blanching, freezing, and fermentation on kelp quality were assessed and processed kelp was used to produce sauerkraut. Blanching significantly decreased (p ≤ 0.05) the instrumental kelp a* value and firmness. The a* value negatively correlated with overall liking of salads. To prepare sauerkraut, raw, raw/frozen (-20 °C), blanched (100 °C, 1 min), or blanched/frozen kelp were mixed with cabbage, salted, inoculated with starter cultures and fermented. Inconsistent trends in L* values, firmness, and fungi enumeration were observed after fermentation. Consumers evaluated kelp salad (n = 100) and sauerkraut (n = 80) for acceptability. Blanched kelp salad had higher hedonic scores than raw kelp salad. A 100% cabbage sauerkraut control and blanched kelp/cabbage blends were compared; kelp blends were similar to control for appearance, color, and texture but were lower for overall acceptability. Results suggest improved quality and enhanced consumer acceptability of seaweed products with use of minimal processing."

Subjects were randomly assigned to consume thirty tablets/d (10 tablets orally, 3 times/d) containing either iodine-reduced kelp powder (test, 6 g kelp powder corresponding to 3 g alginate/d) or kelp-free powder (placebo) for 8 weeks. Anthropometric measurements, blood lipids, and serum thyroid hormone levels were obtained before and after the trial. Body fat percentage was significantly decreased in male subjects from the test group compared with the placebo group. The same tendency was observed for body weight (p = 0.065) and BMI (p = 0.072) in male subjects. No significant changes in anthropometric measurements or visceral fat area were observed in female subjects. Serum thyroid hormone concentrations did not increase after 1.03 mg/d of iodine supplementation through kelp intake. The intake of iodine-reduced kelp powder led to significant and safe reductions in body fat percentage in overweight male subjects. The consumption of kelp high in alginate may contribute to preventing obesity without influencing thyroid function in Japanese subjects with a relatively high intake of iodine from seaweed.",

      "abstract": "The kelp Laminaria solidungula is an important foundation species in the circumpolar Arctic. One of the largest populations of L. solidungula in the Beaufort Sea occurs in Stefansson Sound, off the north coast of Alaska. We surveyed kelp populations in the Stefansson Sound Boulder Patch and found that inshore sites in close proximity (3.5 km) to river input and increased turbidity exhibited lower sporophyte densities (0.36 ± 0.44 · m-2 ) than more offshore sites (>7 km) to the west (0.72 ± 0.48 · m-2 ) and east (4.72 ± 1.51 · m-2 ). We performed culture experiments to examine the possible combined effects of salinity and light on microscopic sporophyte production. Gametophytes cultured in the low salinity treatment (10) were unable to produce sporophytes regardless of light level. The highest light level tested (40 µmol photons · m-2  · s-1 ) produced the greatest sporophyte densities (0.037 ± 0.08 · mm-2 ) at a salinity of 30. Subsequent experimental work on the effect of salinity on microscopic stages revealed that haploid stages were not capable of producing sporophytes at a salinity of 10, but 3-month-old microscopic sporophytes were able to persist in the lower (10 and 20) salinity treatments. Although L. solidungula sporophytes have apparently acclimated to extreme salinity (<5-33) and light variations, the vulnerability of haploid microscopic stages to reduced salinity has the potential to affect future populations as the timing and magnitude of freshwater input to the Arctic Ocean changes.",

Notably, in comparison to individual metal toxicity, knowledge about the effects of HMs and PAHs mixtures on kelps remains scarce. Accordingly, we performed in vitro experiments to determine the individual and combined effects of Cu, Cd, and PAHs on spore release, settlement, and germination on Macrocystis pyrifera and Lessonia spicata, two key-habitat forming kelp species of the coast of the Valparaíso Region in Chile. This region concentrates highly polluting industries, mainly due to unrestrained mining and fossil-fuel energy production. Single Cu, Cd, and PAHs treatments included concentrations in the ranges 5-200, 0.125-2000, and 0.05-100 μg/L, respectively, and a toxic-free treatment. Cu, Cd, and PAHs concentrations causing 20-50% (IC20, IC50) arrested spore release, settlement, and germination were determined, and the results shown in both species that single Cu, Cd, and PAHs IC20 values were generally lower on spore release than on spore settlement and germination, probably due to the absence of a cell wall in spores compared to later stages. Binary equitoxic IC20s mixture treatments changed from an antagonistic response to another with a greater inhibitory effect on spore release, from hour 1 to 7, whereas in IC50 treatments, the response was always antagonistic. The tertiary IC20 mixture of Cu+Cd+PAHs produced generally an antagonistic effect. Remarkably, all IC20 equitoxic mixture treatments showed a synergistic response on spore settlement in both kelps, suggesting that these toxicants are extremely harmful to kelp population persistence near highly polluted sites.",

Dry cell weight and photosynthesis of Saccharina japonica female gametophytes increased when glyphosate was used as the sole phosphorus source at the concentration of less than 20 mg L-1. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis unambiguously confirmed that female gametophytes of the brown alga Saccharina japonica have the capability of breaking the C-P bond of glyphosate to orthophosphate, which finds the enormous potential of the most common seaweed to degrade the most widely used herbicide in the world. Furthermore, this is the first report on the use of glyphosate as the sole phosphorus source for the growth of eukaryotic cells. Because of the wide distribution and relatively easy cultivation of the fast-growing brown alga Saccharina japonica on the coast, our results set a promising stage for developing large macroalgae-based biotechnologies that can be applied for the remediation of contaminated seawater, which is greener and more cost-effective than conventional treatment methods.",

Analysis of the proteins in the gel indicated that the carbonyl content increased, while the contents of total sulfhydryl and amino groups decreased. The proteins appeared to have no α-helix structures, and the endogenous tryptophan content appeared to decrease. The results of SDS-PAGE indicated that the RF and KPE treated samples under UVA irradiation showed massive MP cross-linking by covalent bonds. Electron spin resonance (ESR) results indicated that UVA irradiation generated free radicals in RF and KPE, which ultimately led to an improvement in MP gel properties.

Comparisons of populations in the absence of environmental effects allow unbiased quantification of the meta-population adaptive potential and resolution of population-specific differentiation. Following this approach, we tested the hypothesis that genetically distinct arctic and temperate kelp exhibit different thermal phenotypes, by comparing the capacity of their microscopic life stages to recover from elevated temperatures. Gametophytes of Laminaria digitata (Arctic and North Sea) grown at 15°C for 3 years were subjected to common garden conditions with static or dynamic (i.e., gradual) thermal treatments ranging between 15 and 25°C and also to darkness. Gametophyte growth and survival during thermal stress conditions, and subsequent sporophyte recruitment at two recovery temperatures (5 and 15°C), were investigated. Population-specific responses were apparent; North Sea gametophytes exhibited higher growth rates and greater sporophyte recruitment than those from the Arctic when recovering from high temperatures, revealing differential thermal adaptation. All gametophytes performed poorly after recovery from a static 8-day exposure at 22.5°C compared to the response under a dynamic thermal treatment with a peak temperature of 25°C, demonstrating the importance of gradual warming and/or acclimation time in modifying thermal limits. Recovery temperature markedly affected the capacity of gametophytes to reproduce following high temperatures, regardless of the population. Recovery at 5°C resulted in higher sporophyte production following a 15°C and 20°C static exposure, whereas recovery at 15°C was better for gametophyte exposures to static 22.5°C or dynamic heat stress to 25°C. The subtle performance differences between populations originating from sites with contrasting local in situ temperatures support our hypothesis that their thermal plasticity has diverged over evolutionary time scales.",

      "abstract": "Due to climate change, the incidence of marine heat waves (MHWs) has increased, yet their effects on seaweeds are still not well understood. Adult sporophytes of Macrocystis pyrifera, the species forming the iconic giant kelp forests, can be negatively affected by thermal stress and associated environmental factors (e.g., nutrient depletion, light deprivation); however, little is known about the tolerance/vulnerability of juvenile sporophytes. Simultaneously to MHWs, juveniles can be subjected to light limitation for extended periods of time (days-weeks) due to factors causing turbidity, or even because of shading by understory canopy-forming seaweeds. This study evaluated the effects of a simulated MHW (24°C, 7 d) in combination (or not) with light deprivation, on the photosynthetic capacities, nutrient uptake, and tissue composition, as well as oxidative stress descriptors of M. pyrifera juvenile sporophytes (single blade stage, up to 20 cm length). Maximum quantum yield (Fv /Fm ) decreased in juveniles under light at 24°C, likely reflecting some damage on the photosynthetic apparatus or dynamic photoinhibition; however, no other sign of physiological alteration was found in this treatment (i.e., pigments, nutrient reserves and uptake, oxidative stress). Photosynthetic capacities were maintained or even enhanced in plants under light deprivation, likely supported by photoacclimation (pigments increment); by contrast, nitrate uptake and internal storage of carbohydrates were strongly reduced, regardless of temperature. This study indicated that light limitation can be more detrimental to juvenile survival, and therefore recruitment success of M. pyrifera forests, than episodic thermal stress from MHWs.",

CNFs were further oxidized by TEMPO-oxidized system, and the lengths of the oxidized CNFs (TEMPO-CNFs) were 0.6-1 μm. AFM and TEM images showed that intertwined CNFs fibers were divided into individual nanofibrils. The crystallinity of TEMPO-CNFs increased to 66.5 %. TGA analysis indicated that TEMPO-CNFs were more sensitive to temperature than cellulose and CNFs. FT-IR spectra revealed no changes in the basic cellulose structures of CNFs and TEMPO-CNFs. In the sunflower oil/water (20/80, v/v) model emulsions, the oil droplet sizes were less than 20 μm in CNFs emulsions, which became smaller in TEMPO-CNFs emulsions. Delamination was found in CNFs emulsions after three days of storage. Addition of NaCl increased the volumes of TEMPO-CNFs emulsions but enlarged the oil droplets sizes. TEMPO-CNFs emulsions had the largest volume with smallest and most homogeneous oil droplets at pH 3. TEMPO-CNFs emulsions showed good stability after storage for 30 days. Further, TEMPO-CNFs could also emulsify 50 % (v/v) of sunflower oil. All these results indicated that TEMPO-CNFs can be used in preparing Pickering emulsions.",

      "abstract": "Kelp forests are in decline globally and large-scale intervention could be required to halt the loss of these valuable ecosystems. To date kelp forest restoration has had limited success and been expensive and unable to address the increasing scale of ecosystem deterioration. Here we developed and tested a new approach: \"green gravel\". Small rocks were seeded with kelp and reared in the laboratory until 2-3 cm, before out-planting to the field. The out-planted kelp had high survival and growth over 9 months, even when dropped from the surface. This technique is cheap, simple, and does not require scuba diving or highly trained field workers. It can be up-scaled to treat large areas or even used to introduce genes from more resilient kelp populations onto vulnerable reefs. Green gravel thus overcomes some of the current major limitations of kelp restoration and provides a promising new defense against kelp forest decline."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Kelps (Laminariales, Phaeophyceae) are brown macroalgae of utmost ecological, and increasingly economic, importance on temperate to polar rocky shores. Omics approaches in brown algae are still scarce and knowledge of their acclimation mechanisms to the changing conditions experienced in coastal environments can benefit from the application of RNA-sequencing. Despite evidence of ecotypic differentiation, transcriptomic responses from distinct geographical locations have, to our knowledge, never been studied in the sugar kelp Saccharina latissima so far. RESULTS: In this study we investigated gene expression responses using RNA-sequencing of S. latissima from environments with contrasting temperature and salinity conditions - Roscoff, in temperate eastern Atlantic, and Spitsbergen in the Arctic. Juvenile sporophytes derived from uniparental stock cultures from both locations were pre-cultivated at 8 °C and SA 30. Sporophytes acclimated to 0 °C, 8 °C and 15 °C were exposed to a low salinity treatment (SA 20) for 24 h. Hyposalinity had a greater impact at the transcriptomic level than the temperature alone, and its effects were modulated by temperature. Namely, photosynthesis and pigment synthesis were extensively repressed by low salinity at low temperatures. Although some responses were shared among sporophytes from the different sites, marked differences were revealed by principal component analysis, differential expression and GO enrichment. The interaction between low temperature and low salinity drove the largest changes in gene expression in sporophytes from Roscoff while specimens from Spitsbergen required more metabolic adjustment at higher temperatures. Moreover, genes related to cell wall adjustment were differentially expressed between Spitsbergen and Roscoff control samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals interactive effects of temperature and salinity on transcriptomic profiles in S. latissima. Moreover, our data suggest that under identical culture conditions sporophytes from different locations diverge in their transcriptomic responses. This is probably connected to variations in temperature and salinity in their respective environment of origin. The current transcriptomic results support the plastic response pattern in sugar kelp which is a species with several reported ecotypes. Our data provide the baseline for a better understanding of the underlying processes of physiological plasticity and may help in the future to identify strains adapted to specific environments and its genetic control.",

Here, we optimized vitrification factors to improve the survival and hatching rate of kelp grouper (Epinephelus moara) embryos after cryopreservation. We screened the effects of 11 vitrification solution concentrations (25-50%) on the survival rate of embryos at four developmental stages (16S, 18S, 22S, TB). We investigated the effects of different equilibration time (25-45min) on the survival rate and the influence of vitrification solutions on embryonic volume. In addition, we tested the effects of treating embryos at five different developmental stages (4-6S, 16S, 22S, TB, HB) with different vitrification solutions (35% PMG3S and 35% PMG3T), prechilling temperature (-5 °C and 4 °C) and prechilling time. In total, 9855 embryos were cryopreserved at 10 developmental stages, from optic capsule stage to pre-hatch stage. We found that kelp grouper embryos performed best at equilibration time of 30 min. Embryos at the tail-bud stage exhibited greater tolerance to vitrification than other stages. Vitrification solutions that contained sucrose showed better survival rates compared to embryos treated with vitrification solutions containing trehalose. Pre-chilling treatment improved viability before freezing, but did not improve viability after freezing. In the most optimal condition we identified in this study, the average survival, normal development and malformation rates of cryopreserved embryos were 6.32%, 2.36% and 3.49%, and 39.85% of the surviving embryos that were cryopreserved hatched. The hatched larvae gradually died at day 12 of cultivation, where the longest surviving individuals lived for 16 days. This study provides valuable data for improving survival and hatching rate of cryopreserved grouper embryos, and provides references for further exploring techniques in fish embryo cryopreservation.",

Generally, the primary therapeutic remedies are diet, physical exercise, medication, and bariatric surgery. However, an increased number of obese and overweight people are using complementary and herbal slimming supplements. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 70-years-old Caucasian woman presented to the outpatient clinic with tachycardia (>100 bpm), insomnia, anxiety, and recent weight loss (6 kilos in 3 months). She had no previous thyroid disease, but she presented transient hyperthyroidism at 3 months after ingestion of tablets containing kelp seaweeds. DIAGNOSES: Hypertensive and obese patient, without previous thyroid disease, presented with transient hyperthyroidism at 3 months following ingestion of tablets containing kelp seaweed. INTERVENTIONS: The kelp-containing tablets were discontinued, and antithyroid therapy with Methimazole was initiated as follows: Methimazole at 15 mg/day for 1 month, at 10 mg/day in the second month, and 5 mg/day for the third month. OUTCOMES: After 3 months of antithyroid therapy and without the consumption of kelp - containing tablets, normal thyroid function was regained. Further analysis revealed normal thyroid function, so the hyperthyroidism reversed completely. LESSONS: Adults who consume complementary medication based on kelp seaweed should be informed of the risk of developing thyroid dysfunction also in the absence of any pre-existing thyroid disease. Due to the high iodine content, supplements containing kelp should be taken with the supervision of a physician and with monitoring of thyroid function.",

The composite material was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), and elemental analyzer. The Alg-KBC showed high removal capacity for crystal violet (CV), from aqueous solution (33.8% more than that of the pristine alginate bead). The adsorption isotherm data were fitted to the nonlinear forms of the Langmuir, Freundlich, and Redlich-Peterson isotherm models. Also, the adsorption kinetics data were analyzed with the nonlinear forms of the pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and intra-particle diffusion models. Both chemisorption and physisorption with an indispensable role of external mass transfer and stagewise pore diffusion were essential in the adsorption process. Thus, by impregnating biochar powder in alginate, a bio-platform, a composite hydrogel bead which has higher affinity for cationic dye in aqueous medium and also eliminates the onerous task of separating biochar powder from the adsorbate solution, was obtained. Hence, the Alg-KBC can be considered for efficient dye removal in the wastewater treatment process.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Coastal protection from erosion and flooding is a significant ecosystem service provided by vegetated marine systems. Kelp beds are a dominant habitat-forming species on temperate reefs worldwide. While they are valued as hotspots of biodiversity, there is a paucity of information that supports their use in nature-based coastal defence. This includes the effectiveness of kelp beds in attenuating waves approaching the shore and how this influences sediment transport. METHODS: Wave loggers were deployed at paired kelp bed and control (urchin barren) treatments at four sites in Port Phillip Bay, Australia. The significant wave height offshore (exposed side) to onshore (sheltered side) of the treatment were compared to determine wave attenuation. KEY RESULTS: At three sites, the wave attenuation of kelp beds was significantly less than that of the control. This result was consistent across the environmental conditions recorded in this study. At the fourth site, on average there was no significant difference in wave transmission between kelp and control. However, wave attenuation at kelp beds was 10 % greater than the control during periods of northerly winds. We highlight the importance of disentangling the effects of the reef substratum and kelp when evaluating the efficacy of kelp at providing coastal protection. CONCLUSIONS: We have highlighted a significant gap in the research on ecosystem services provided by kelp beds. A greater understanding is needed on which kelp species are able to provide coastal protection, and under what conditions. Such future research is essential for providing managers and policy makers with actionable information on sustainable and cost-effective solutions for coastal defence when faced with a changing climate.",

      "abstract": "The Arctic region is currently facing substantial environmental changes due to global warming. Melting glaciers cause reduced salinity environments in coastal Arctic habitats, which may be stressful for kelp beds. To investigate the responses of the kelp Saccharina latissima to the warming Arctic, we studied the transcriptomic changes of S. latissima from Kongsfjorden (Svalbard, Norway) over a 24-hour exposure to two salinities (Absolute Salinity [SA ] 20 and 30) after a 7-day pre-acclimation at three temperatures (0, 8 and 15°C). In addition, corresponding physiological data were assessed during an 11-days salinity/temperature experiment. Growth and maximal quantum yield for photosystem II fluorescence were positively affected by increased temperature during acclimation, whereas hyposalinity caused negative effects at the last day of treatment. In contrast, hyposalinity induced marked changes on the transcriptomic level. Compared to the control (8°C - SA 30), the 8°C - SA 20 exhibited the highest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), followed by the 0°C - SA 20. Comparisons indicate that S. latissima tends to convert its energy from primary metabolism (e.g. photosynthesis) to antioxidant activity under hyposaline stress. The increase in physiological performance at 15°C shows that S. latissima in the Arctic region can adjust and might even benefit from increased temperatures. However, in Arctic fjord environments its performance might become impaired by decreased salinity as a result of ice melting.",

      "abstract": "Kelp systems dominate nearshore marine environments in upwelling zones characterized by cold temperatures and high nutrients. Worldwide, kelp population persistence and recruitment success generally decreases with rising water temperatures coupled with low nutrients, making kelp populations vulnerable to impending warming of the oceans. This response to climate change at a global scale, however, may vary due to regional differences in temperature variability, acclimation, and differential responses of kelp species to changing conditions. Culture experiments were conducted on 12 eastern Pacific kelp taxa across geographic regions (British Columbia, central California, and southern California) under three nitrate levels (1, 5, and 10 μmol/L) and two temperatures (12°C and 18°C) to determine sporophyte production (i.e., recruitment success). For all taxa from all locations, sporophytes were always present in the 12°C treatment and when recruitment failure was observed, it always occurred at 18°C, regardless of nitrate level, indicating that temperature is the driving factor limiting recruitment, not nitrate. Rising ocean temperatures will undoubtedly cause recruitment failure for many kelp species; however, the ability of species to acclimatize or adapt to increased temperatures at the warmer edge of their species range may promote a resiliency of kelp systems to climate change at a global scale.",

      "abstract": "The combination of traditional Chinese medicines can improve the efficacy of cancer treatment. Furthermore, the combination of the traditional Chinese medicine curcuma zedoary and kelp was used to enhance the effect of the dissipation of blood stasis in pediatrics during the Song Dynasty. Curcumenol and laminarin, the main components of curcuma zedoary and kelp, are also reported to have a wide range of biological activities. Therefore, we hypothesize that the combination of curcuma zedoary and kelp may prevent the development of cancer. The aim of this research was to confirm whether a combination of curcuma zedoary and kelp could inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of hepatoma cells and consequently improve prognosis. In this study, we firstly found in H22-bearing mice that the combination of curcuma zedoary and kelp inhibited tumor growth and the expression of metastasis-related proteins (MMPs, VEGF, pAkt, pERK1/2). Meanwhile, the decreased cystathionine beta synthase (CBS, an endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) synthetase) level was also observed in H22-bearing mice admistrated with the combination of curcuma zedoary and kelp. It was also observed that the combination of curcumenol and laminarin inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Furthermore, we investigated the potential inhibiting mechanism of the combination of curcumenol and laminarin on HepG2 cell proliferation and metastasis. Our previous research showed that a CBS/H2S system was vital for maintaining the proliferation in hepatoma cells. Here, we found that the levels of pSTAT3 and BCL-2 were decreased in CBS knockdown HepG2 cells and the combination of curcumenol and laminarin significantly decreased the H2S level in a dose-dependent manner and down-regulated the levels of pSTAT3 and BCL-2 in HepG2 cells. Angiogenesis, positively regulated by the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is essential for human cancer metastasis. In the present study, we found that the combination of curcumenol and laminarin could significantly down-regulate the expression levels of VEGF and its downstream key genes pAkt and pERK1/2. Furthermore, previous research showed that hydrogen sulfide could stimulate angiogenesis. Here, we also observed the reduction of the VEGF, Akt, pAkt, ERK1/2 and pERK1/2 proteins levels and the inhibition of proliferation and metastasis in CBS knockdown HepG2 cells. Moreover, exogenous H2S rescued the cytological results caused by the combination of curcumenol and laminarin. Taken together, the combination of curcuma zedoary and kelp could inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of liver cancer cells in vivo and in vitro by inhibiting endogenous H2S production and down-regulating the pSTAT3/BCL-2 and VEGF pathway, which provides strong evidence for the application of curcuma zedoary and kelp in treatments of liver cancer.",

We evaluated meiospore development of the kelps Macrocystis pyrifera and Undaria pinnatifida exposed to a factorial combination of current and 2100-predicted temperature (12 and 16 °C, respectively), pH (8.16 and 7.65, respectively), and two copper levels (no-added-copper and species-specific germination Cu-EC50). Meiospore germination for both species declined by 5-18% under OA and ambient temperature/OA conditions, irrespective of copper exposure. Germling growth rate declined by >40%·day-1, and gametophyte development was inhibited under Cu-EC50 exposure, compared to the no-added-copper treatment, irrespective of pH and temperature. Following the removal of copper and 9-day recovery under respective pH and temperature treatments, germling growth rates increased by 8-18%·day-1. The exception was U. pinnatifida under OW/OA, where growth rate remained at 10%·day-1 before and after copper exposure. Copper-binding ligand concentrations were higher in copper-exposed cultures of both species, suggesting that ligands may act as a defence mechanism of kelp early life stages against copper toxicity. Our study demonstrated that copper pollution is more important than global climate drivers in controlling meiospore development in kelps as it disrupts the completion of their life cycle.",

      "abstract": "Although trophic cascades were originally believed to be driven only by predators eating prey, there is mounting evidence that such cascades can be generated in large part via non-consumptive effects. This is especially important in cascades affecting habitat-forming foundation species that in turn, influence associated communities. Here, we use laboratory and field experiments to identify a trait-mediated indirect interaction between predators and an abundant kelp in a marine temperate reef system. Predation risk from a microcarnivorous fish, the señorita, suppressed grazing by the host-specific seaweed limpet, which in turn, influenced frond loss of the habitat-forming feather boa kelp. This trophic cascade was pronounced because minor amounts of limpet grazing decreased the strength required to break kelp fronds. Cues from fish predators mitigated kelp loss by decreasing limpet grazing; we found 86% of this indirect interaction between predator and kelp was attributed to the non-consumptive effect in the laboratory and 56% when applying the same effect size calculations to the field. In field manipulations, the non-consumptive effect of señorita was as strong as the total predator effect and most importantly, as strong as the uncaged, \"open\" treatment with natural levels of predators. Our findings demonstrate that the mere presence of this fish reduces frond loss of the feather boa kelp through a trait-mediated trophic cascade. Moreover, despite large volumes of water, current flow, and wave energy, we clearly demonstrate a strong non-consumptive effect via an apparent chemical cue from señorita, suggesting that chemically mediated trait-driven cascades may be more prevalent in subtidal marine systems than we are currently aware.",

This study investigated potential dewatering methods for kelp harvested throughout the year. Treatments included air-drying, osmotic media and acids. Significant interactions between treatment and harvest-time were observed for traits of interest. Fresh weight loss during treatment was composed of changes in water and dry matter content. Air-drying gave reliable increase in final dry matter content; in summer and autumn 30% dry matter content was reached after 24h. Dilute hydrochloric acid reduced stickiness and rendered material suitable for dewatering by screw-pressing; it may be possible to use the consequent pH reduction to promote efficient preservation.",

The radicle length (4.97 cm), fresh weight (0.32 g/10 seedlings) and dry weight (0.015 g/10 seedlings) were significantly increased in the treatment of 2% KWE. KWE also could enhance the root growth, the maximum leaf length × width and the fresh weight of plants, the optimal value of which increased by 8.37 cm, 58.14 cm2 and 7.76 g under the treatment of 10% KWE compared with the control respectively. Meanwhile, the contents of vitamin C and soluble sugars in pakchoi leaf were improved by 19.6 mg/100 g and 1.44 mg/g compared with the control, and the nitrate content was decreased by 212.27 mg/kg.

      "abstract": "Ocean acidification (OA), the ongoing decline in seawater pH, is predicted to have wide-ranging effects on marine organisms and ecosystems. For seaweeds, the pH at the thallus surface, within the diffusion boundary layer (DBL), is one of the factors controlling their response to OA. Surface pH is controlled by both the pH of the bulk seawater and by the seaweeds' metabolism: photosynthesis and respiration increase and decrease pH within the DBL (pHDBL ), respectively. However, other metabolic processes, especially the uptake of inorganic nitrogen (Ni ; NO3- and NH4+ ) may also affect the pHDBL . Using Macrocystis pyrifera, we hypothesized that (1) NO3- uptake will increase the pHDBL , whereas NH4+ uptake will decrease it, (2) if NO3- is cotransported with H+ , increases in pHDBL would be greater under an OA treatment (pH = 7.65) than under an ambient treatment (pH = 8.00), and (3) decreases in pHDBL will be smaller at pH 7.65 than at pH 8.00, as higher external [H+ ] might affect the strength of the diffusion gradient. Overall, Ni source did not affect the pHDBL . However, increases in pHDBL were greater at pH 7.65 than at pH 8.00. CO2 uptake was higher at pH 7.65 than at pH 8.00, whereas HCO3- uptake was unaffected by pH. Photosynthesis and respiration control pHDBL rather than Ni uptake. We suggest that under future OA, Macrocystis pyrifera will metabolically modify its surface microenvironment such that the physiological processes of photosynthesis and Ni uptake will not be affected by a reduced pH.",

The average surface oceanic pH is predicted to decline by 0.4 units by 2100. However, kelp metabolically modifies seawater pH via photosynthesis and respiration in some temperate coastal systems, resulting in daily pH fluctuations of up to ±0.45 units. It is unknown how these fluctuations in pH influence the growth and physiology of the kelp, or how this might change with OA. In laboratory experiments that mimicked the most extreme pH fluctuations measured within beds of the canopy-forming kelp Ecklonia radiata in Tasmania, the growth and photosynthetic rates of juvenile E. radiata were greater under fluctuating pH (8.4 in the day, 7.8 at night) than in static pH treatments (8.4, 8.1, 7.8). However, pH fluctuations had no effect on growth rates and a negative effect on photosynthesis when the mean pH of each treatment was reduced by 0.3 units. Currently, pH fluctuations have a positive effect on E. radiata but this effect could be reversed in the future under OA, which is likely to impact the future ecological dynamics and productivity of habitats dominated by E. radiata.",

      "abstract": "Foundation species create milieus in which ecosystems evolve, altering species abundances and distribution often to a dramatic degree. Although much descriptive work supports their importance, there remains little definitive information on the mechanisms by which foundation species alter their environment. These mechanisms fall into two basic categories: provision of food or other materials, and modification of the physical environment. Here, we manipulated the abundance of a marine foundation species, the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, in 40 × 40-m plots at Mohawk Reef off Santa Barbara, California and found that its biomass had a strong positive effect on the abundance of bottom-dwelling sessile invertebrates. We examined the carbon (C) stable isotope values of seven species of sessile invertebrates in the treatment plots to test the hypothesis that this positive effect resulted from a nutritional supplement of small suspended particles of kelp detritus, as many studies have posited. We found no evidence from stable isotope analyses to support the hypothesis that kelp detritus is an important food source for sessile suspension-feeding invertebrates. The isotope composition of invertebrates varied with species and season, but was not affected by kelp biomass, with the exception of two species: the tunicate Styela montereyensis, which exhibited a slight enrichment in C stable isotope composition with increasing kelp biomass, and the hydroid Aglaophenia sp., which showed the opposite effect. These results suggest that modification of the physical habitat, rather than nutritional subsidy by kelp detritus, likely accounts for increased abundance of sessile invertebrates within giant kelp forests.",

Here we examined how the physiology of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera is affected by elevated pCO2/low pH. Growth and photosynthetic rates, external and internal carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity, HCO3 (-) versus CO2 use were determined over a 7-day incubation at ambient pCO2 400 µatm/pH 8.00 and a future OA treatment of pCO2 1200 µatm/pH 7.59. Neither the photosynthetic nor growth rates were changed by elevated CO2 supply in the OA treatment. These results were explained by the greater use of HCO3 (-) compared to CO2 as an inorganic carbon (Ci) source to support photosynthesis. Macrocystis is a mixed HCO3 (-) and CO2 user that exhibits two effective mechanisms for HCO3 (-) utilization; as predicted for species that possess carbon-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs), photosynthesis was not substantially affected by elevated pCO2. The internal CA activity was also unaffected by OA, and it remained high and active throughout the experiment; this suggests that HCO3 (-) uptake via an anion exchange protein was not affected by OA. Our results suggest that photosynthetic Ci uptake and growth of Macrocystis will not be affected by elevated pCO2/low pH predicted for the future, but the combined effects with other environmental factors like temperature and nutrient availability could change the physiological response of Macrocystis to OA. Therefore, further studies will be important to elucidate how this species might respond to the global environmental change predicted for the ocean.",

Signs of hyperthyroidism occurred shortly after a kelp-containing diet. Hyperthyroidism lasted 2 months and was followed by an overt hypothyroidism. The thyroid scintiscan exhibited an extremely low uptake and colour-Doppler ultrasonography revealed multiple small areas of pulsatile flow. After 3 months of levothyroxine substitutive therapy, normal thyroid function was recovered after levothyroxine discontinuation. This clinical history is compatible with a case of iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis followed by prolonged block of the sodium-iodide symporter activity as a consequence of excessive iodine consumption from kelp.

      "abstract": "1. Corni fructus is the fruit of Cornus officinalis, a dogwood species. This study was conducted to prepare fermented corni fructus preparation (FCFP) and fermented kelp (FK) from corni fructus and by-products of Laminaria japonica fermented with Bacillus subtilis and Aspergillus oryzae. 2. The effects of dietary FCFP and FK as replacer of oxytetracycline (OTC) on growth performance, meat composition, meat oxidative stability, and emissions of ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulphide (H2S) from broiler chicken droppings were investigated. 3. A total of 140 d-old broiler chicks were randomly allotted to 4 dietary treatments including control, OTC (0.05 g/kg), FCFP (5 g/kg), and FK (5 g/kg). 4. Overall, inclusion of FCFP resulted in lower weight gain and feed intake during the overall experimental period. Broilers fed FCFP diets tended to have lower crude fat and higher crude ash content in the carcasses. 5. In the fresh state, the malondialdehyde (MDA) value of broiler meat was lower in the FK supplemented group. At one week, meat from broilers fed antibiotic and FK diets had lower MDA values, whereas at 2 weeks broiler meat from all dietary treatment groups had lower MDA values than the control. 6. Dietary supplementation with FK significantly reduced faecal NH3 emissions throughout the experimental period, whereas dietary OTC and FCFP supplementation increased NH3 emissions at 2 and 4 weeks. There were no significant effects of dietary treatments on H2S emissions throughout the experimental period, except during week one, when FCFP supplementation reduced the emission. 7. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with 5 g/kg FK improved the oxidative stability of broiler meat and reduce faecal NH3 emissions without affecting growth performance.",

      "abstract": "Marine ecosystems are increasingly at risk from overexploitation and fisheries collapse. As managers implement recovery plans, shifts in species interactions may occur broadly with potential consequences for ecosystem structure and function. In kelp forests off San Nicolas Island, California, USA, we describe striking changes in size structure and life history traits (e.g., size at maturation and sex change) of a heavily fished, ecologically important predator, the California sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher). These changes occurred in two phases: (1) after intense commercial fishery exploitation in the late 1990s and (2) following recovery in the late 2000s, nearly a decade after management intervention. Using gut contents and stable-isotope values of sheephead and their prey, we found evidence for a dietary niche expansion upon recovery of population size structure to include increased consumption of sea urchins and other mobile invertebrate grazers by larger sized fish. By examining historical diet data and a time series of benthic community composition, we conclude that changes in dietary niche breadth are more likely due to the recovery of size structure from fishing than major shifts in prey availability. Size-dependent predator-prey interactions may have ecosystem consequences and management measures that preserve or restore size structure, and therefore historical trophic roles of key predators, could be vital for maintaining kelp forest ecosystem health.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the impact of multiple stressors on ecosystems is of pronounced importance, particularly when one or more of those stressors is anthropogenic. Here we investigated the role of physical disturbance and increased nutrients on reefs dominated by the canopy-forming kelp Ecklonia radiata. We combined experimental kelp canopy removals and additional nutrient at three different locations in a large embayment in temperate southeastern Australia. Over the following winter recruitment season, Ecklonia recruitment was unaffected by increased nutrients alone, but tripled at all sites where the canopy had been removed. At one site, the combination of disturbance and increased nutrients resulted in more than four times the recruitment of the introduced kelp Undaria pinnatifida. Six months after disturbance, the proliferation of the Undaria canopy in the canopy-removal and nutrient-addition treatment negatively influenced the recovery of the native kelp Ecklonia. Given the otherwise competitive dominance of adult Ecklonia, this provides a mechanism whereby Undaria could maintain open space for the following recruitment season. This interplay between disturbance, nutrients and the response of native and invasive species makes a compelling case for how a combination of factors can influence species dynamics.",

Data were collected using a web-based online anonymous survey under Institutional Review Board approval from Boston University. This report is based on 27 responses from subjects with thyroid cancer who use kelp. Demographic factors and complementary and alternative use were included. Respondents were primarily over age 40, white, female and have at least a high school education. The top five modalities were multivitamins, special diets, herbal supplements, prayer for health reasons and herbal tea. Only one patient reported perceiving a particular modality had a negative effect on treatment. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) was more often perceived as being used to aid their thyroid cancer treatment than to help with symptoms. On average, respondents who use kelp also use at least 11 additional CAM modalities. Only 1/2 of respondents who use kelp reported telling their physicians about their CAM use, and nearly 1/3 of respondents reported their CAM use was neither known, prescribed nor asked about by their physicians. In comparison to both national surveys of the general US population and patients with thyroid cancer, kelp users with thyroid cancer use at least twice the number of additional CAM therapies and report their use far less often. Physicians who treat patients with thyroid cancer should be aware of these data to further assist in their assessment and care.",

      "abstract": "Hypoglycemic effects and the use of kelp in diabetes mellitus (DM) model rats induced by alloxan were investigated. Sixty healthy male rats were used to establish DM models by injecting alloxan intraperitoneally. Kelp powder was added to the general forage for the rats. The levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG) were determined by an automatic blood glucose device. Electrochemiluminescence immunoassay was applied to determine the serum levels of insulin. The serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured by thiobarbituric acid assay and nitric oxide (NO) by nitrate reductase assay. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) were determined by xanthinoxidase assay and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) by chemical colorimetry. The shape and structure of islet cells were observed with Hematine-Eosin staining, and the expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in islet cells were detected by immunohistochemical assay. The results showed that the serum levels of insulin after treatment with kelp powder increased significantly compared to those in the DM-model group, while the FBG in the medium-high dose treated groups decreased significantly compared to those in the DM-model group (P < 0.05). The levels of MDA and NO in the kelp powder groups were lower than those in the DM-model group, while the activities of SOD and GSH-Px were higher than those in the DM-model group, of which a significant difference existed between the medium-high dose treated groups and the DM-model group (P < 0.05). The shape and structure of islet cells improved with the up-expressing SOD and down-expressing iNOS in the medium-high dose treated groups compared to those in the DM-model group (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the medium and high dose treated groups, all above indexes (P > 0.05). It is suggested that kelp might aid recovery of the the islet cell secreting function and reduce the level of FBG by an antioxidant effect.",

Calves in this study always ranked the control treatment first when given a choice and consumed 34.5% more dry matter from the control treatment in the first 3-d segment of the experiment. During the second feeding segment (d 4 and 5), when the control treatment was removed, daily dry matter consumption was reduced in 4 out of 6 calves compared with control calves when this treatment was available (first feeding segment).

Such trade-offs may dictate a different response of clonal kelps to varying environmental conditions relative to aclonal kelp taxa. Laboratory temperature and nutrient manipulation experiments demonstrated that investment in sexual and vegetative reproduction in Laminaria sinclairii (Harv. ex Hook. f. et Harv.) Farl., C. L. Anderson et D. C. Eaton was regulated by different abiotic factors. Sorus production (investment in sexual reproduction) and blade growth were significantly higher at 12°C compared to 17°C, regardless of nutrient concentration. Net carbon storage and depletion in rhizomes were observed in the low- and high-temperature treatments, respectively, suggesting that carbon stores were not responsible for increased growth. Rhizome elongation (investment in vegetative reproduction), on the other hand, was significantly higher in 12 μM NO3- than in 2 μM NO3- , irrespective of temperature. This increase in rhizome growth was concurrent with elevated rhizome percent tissue nitrogen levels also observed in treatments with higher nutrients, again indicating a growth response to treatment independent of previous nutrient stores. These results suggest that regulation of growth and investment in sexual reproduction in L. sinclairii is similar to that in aclonal kelps (i.e., warmer temperatures result in decreased reproductive output). Additionally, depletion of carbon and nitrogen from rhizomes in suboptimal conditions confirms the role of clonal kelp rhizomes in carbon and nutrient storage."

      "abstract": "Epidemiological studies suggest that populations consuming typical Asian diets have a lower incidence of hormone-dependent cancers than populations consuming Western diets. These dietary differences have been mainly attributed to higher soy intakes among Asians. However, studies from our laboratory suggest that the anti-estrogenic effects of dietary kelp also may contribute to these reduced cancer rates. As a follow-up to previous findings of endocrine modulation related to kelp ingestion in a pilot study of premenopausal women, we investigated the endocrine modulating effects of kelp (Fucus vesiculosus) in female rats and human luteinized granulosa cells (hLGC). Kelp administration lengthened the rat estrous cycle from 4.3 +/- 0.96 to 5.4 +/- 1.7 d at 175 mg . kg(-1) body wt . d(-1) (P = 0.05) and to 5.9 +/- 1.9 d at 350 mg . kg(-1) . d(-1) (P = 0.002) and also led to a 100% increase in the length of diestrus (P = 0.02). Following 175 mg . kg(-1) . d(-1) treatment for 2 wk, serum 17beta-estradiol levels were reduced from 48.9 +/- 4.5 to 40.2 +/- 3.2 ng/L (P = 0.13). After 4 wk, 17beta-estradiol levels were reduced to 36.7 +/- 2.2 ng/L (P = 0.02). In hLGC, 25, 50, and 75 micromol/L treatment reduced 17beta-estradiol levels from 4732 +/- 591 to 3632 +/- 758, 3313 +/- 373, and 3060 +/- 538 ng/L, respectively. Kelp treatment also led to modest elevations in hLGC culture progesterone levels. Kelp extract inhibited the binding of estradiol to estrogen receptor alpha and beta and that of progesterone to the progesterone receptor, with IC(50) values of 42.4, 31.8, and 40.7 micromol/L, respectively. These data show endocrine modulating effects of kelp at relevant doses and suggest that dietary kelp may contribute to the lower incidence of hormone-dependent cancers among the Japanese.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of ingestion of two different doses of supplemental kelp on the thyroid function of healthy euthyroid subjects. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind prospective clinical trial involving 36 healthy euthyroid subjects, who were randomly assigned to receive placebo (4 alfalfa capsules per day), low-dose kelp (2 kelp capsules and 2 alfalfa capsules per day), or high-dose kelp (4 kelp capsules per day) for 4 weeks. Thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone or TSH), free thyroxine, and total triiodothyronine were assessed at weeks 0, 4, and 6. Response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation, urinary iodine excretion, and basal metabolic rate were determined at weeks 0 and 4. RESULTS: TSH concentrations did not differ significantly between week 0 and week 4 in the placebo group (P = 0.16) but increased significantly in both the low-dose kelp (P = 0.04) and high-dose kelp (P = 0.002) groups. Free thyroxine concentrations decreased slightly but significantly after 4 weeks of placebo but were unchanged in the low-dose and the high-dose kelp groups. In contrast, total triiodothyronine levels did not differ significantly after 4 weeks of placebo or low-dose kelp therapy but were significantly decreased after high-dose kelp therapy (P = 0.04). Similarly, the thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test showed no significant change in poststimulation TSH after 4 weeks in the placebo or low-dose kelp groups but revealed a significantly increased response after high-dose kelp therapy (P = 0.0002). The 24-hour urinary iodine excretion showed dose-dependent increases in the two kelp study groups. Basal metabolic rate did not change significantly in any study group during the 4-week study period. All thyroid laboratory values returned to baseline 2 weeks after cessation of kelp supplementation, except for TSH in the high-dose kelp group, which was significantly decreased. CONCLUSION: Short-term dietary supplementation with kelp significantly increases both basal and poststimulation TSH. These findings corroborate previous studies on the effects of supplemental iodide given to euthyroid subjects for a similar period. Further studies are needed to determine whether long-term kelp supplementation would cause clinically significant thyroid disease.",

      "abstract": "1. The hypotensive effect of green beans, common rue and kelp was recently shown in normotensive rats in vivo. A number of mechanisms of action of these aqueous extracts was identified. The present study examined these actions at the tissue level in vitro with possible interactions of these extracts. 2. Rue showed positive chronotropic and inotropic effects on isolated right atria. Green beans and kelp alone showed negative chronotropic effects on isolated right atria but no effect on atrial tension (AT). A combination of green beans and kelp showed no additive effect on the decrease in atrial rate (AR) nor any negative inotropic responses. Combinations of rue and green beans and of rue and kelp showed responses that were either positive or negative chronotropically, were not dose dependent and were less than the sum total of their individual responses (i.e., subtractive). A combination of all three showed subtractive effects on the decrease in AR that were dose related. No change in AT was observed upon treatment with a combination of the three plant extracts in spite of the positive inotropic effect of true. 3. Rue and kelp alone relaxed KCl preconstricted rat tail artery strips probably by a direct effect of vascular smooth muscle. Green beans had no effect. The combination of rue and kelp exerted a subtractive relaxation effect. These plants therefore contained cardiovascular active substances that had a direct effect on the cardiovascular system. These substances further interacted to modify their cardiovascular effects. 4. Data explained why herbs, as in herbal medicine, should be used together therapeutically.",

      "abstract": "Detecting the environmental impacts of human activities on natural communities is a central problem in applied ecology. It is a difficult problem because one must separate human perturbations from the considerable natural temporal variability displayed by most populations. In addition, most human perturbations are generally unique and thus unreplicated. This raises the problem of deciding whether observed local effects are due to human intervention or to the natural differences in temporal patterns that often occur among different sites. These problems can be successfully addressed with the Before-After/Control-Impact (BACI) sampling design, in which Impact and Control sites are sampled contemporaneously and repeatedly in periods Before and After the human perturbation of interest. In the present case, we use this design to examine the ecological effects of the cooling water discharge from a coastal nuclear power plant in southern California. The results suggest some general lessons about the process of impact assessments that are applicable in many ecological contexts. In systems where plants and animals are long-lived and recruit sporadically, the rates of change in density are often so low that sampling more than a few times per year will introduce serial correlations in the data. As a result, for studies of few years duration, few samples will be taken. A small sample size means that the tests of the assumptions underlying the statistical analyses, e.g., independence and additivity, will have low power. This injects uncertainty into the conclusions. Small sample size also means that the power to detect any but very large effects will be low. In our study, sampling periods of 2- yr both Before and After the impact were not long enough to detect a halving or doubling of populations at the impact site. We concluded that there were significant environmental impacts because: (1) the effect size was generally very large (°-75%); (2) there was a consistent pattern among species; (3) there were two Impact sites, and effects were larger at the site nearest the discharge; (4) the observed effects accorded with physical changes that could be linked with the source of impact; and (5) a number of alternative mechanisms, unrelated to the source of impact, were examined and rejected. Relative to control populations, there were statistically significant reductions in density of snails, sea urchins, and sea stars, all of which occurred primarily on rocky substrates. All of the reductions were larger at the Impact station about 0.4 km from the discharge than at a second Impact station 1.4 km away. The most plausible mechanisms for the declines seem to be linked to the turbidity plume created by the power plant and the resultant increase in suspended inorganic and organic materials (+46% at the Impact site nearest the discharge). Any associated flux of fine particles on rocks would have deleterious effects on many of the hard benthos. Populations of two filter-feeding species, a gorgonian coral and a sponge, showed relative increases in density. Although the increase in populations of filter feeders could be related to the ingestion, killing, and discharge of tons of plankton by the cooling system, an alternative natural mechanism was also considered reasonable. Monitoring studies or relatively long-lived organisms will often have low power to detect ecologically significant changes in density. The present study of kelpforest organisms extended over nearly 6 yr, yet the resulting statistical tests generally had power of <30% to detect a doubling or halving in density at a significance level of .05. In such a community it would be a mistake to conclude that there were no significant ecological effects based on conventional hypothesis tests. Unless there is a willingness to accept the fact that changes in natural populations on the order of 50% will often go undetected, the standards and types of evidence used to demonstrate environmental impacts must be changed."

A causal relationship between the intake of the kelp preparation and the thyrotoxic episode could not be established beyond all possible doubt, but the clinical picture and clear temporal relationship strongly pointed in this direction.",
