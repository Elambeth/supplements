      "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are a broadly understood concept focusing on vascular and heart dysfunction. Lack of physical exercise, type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, thromboembolism, and kidney and lung diseases all contribute to the development of heart and blood vessel dysfunction. Although effective and important, traditional treatment with diuretics, statins, beta blockers, calcium inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, and anti-platelet drugs remains a second-line treatment after dietary interventions and lifestyle changes. Scientists worldwide are still looking for an herbal product that would be effective and free from side effects, either taken together with or before the standard pharmacological intervention. Such herbal-originated medication therapy may include Morus alba L. (white mulberry), Elaeagnus rhamnoides (L.) A. Nelson (sea-buckthorn), Allium sativum L. (garlic), Convallaria majalis L. (lily of the valley), Leonurus cardiaca L. (motherwort), and Crataegus spp. (hawthorn). Valuable herbal raw materials include leaves, fruits, seeds, and even thorns. This short review focuses on six herbs that can constitute an interesting and potential therapeutic option in the management of cardiovascular disorders.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Traditional uses of Morus alba L. leaf extracts (MLE) have been reported for treating hyperglycaemia and diabetes. Phytochemical compounds in the leaves demonstrated the ability to enhance insulin sensitivity and β-cell secretory function, suggesting their potential value in reducing blood glucose and treating diabetes. However, the phytochemical constituents and safety of the herbal medicines need to be verified in each experimental field from different growing areas. Studies on the phytochemistry and toxicity of Morus alba leaves in Southeast Asia, especially in Brunei, have never been investigated. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the bioactivity and phytochemistry of Morus alba ethanolic leaf extract from Brunei Darussalam and its subacute toxic effects in the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) female mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The phenolic yield and antioxidant of the extract were analysed. Meanwhile, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography were utilised to determine the phenolic compound of the MLE. In the subacute toxicity study, twenty-five female mice were randomly divided into five groups: the control group, which received oral gavage of 5% dimethyl sulfoxide solvent (DMSO), and the MLE treatment group, which received the extract at a dose of 125, 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg. Physiology, haematology, biochemistry, and histology were evaluated during the study. RESULTS: Morus alba leaf depicted total phenolic 10.93 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g dry weight (DW), flavonoid 256.67 mg quercetin equivalents (QE)/g DW, and antioxidant bioactivity content of 602.03 IC50 μg/mL and 13.21 mg Fe2+/g DW. Twenty compounds in the Morus alba ethanolic leaf extract were identified, with chlorogenic acid (305.60 mg/100 g DW) as the primary compound. As for subacute toxicity in this study, neither mortality nor haematological changes were observed. On the other hand, administration of 500 and 1000 mg/kg MLE resulted in mild hepatocellular injury, as indicated by a significant (p < 0.05) increase in liver enzyme activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). The histopathological score showed mild hepatocellular necrosis in administering 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg of MLE. The parameters of renal injury were within normal limits, with the increase in eosinophilic cytoplasm observed in the histological scoring at 1000 mg/kg of MLE. CONCLUSIONS: Morus alba leaf extract showed abundant polyphenols. In a study on subacute toxicity, MLE caused mild hepatotoxicity in mice. The toxic effect of the extract may be due to kaempferol and chlorogenic acid compounds. The 125 mg/kg MLE dose was safe with no adverse effects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: TB has remained a significant public health concern from historical times to the present day. Each year, growing drug resistance problems necessitate the discovery of new drugs and drug precursors for TB treatment. Morusin is an important flavone found in the bark of white mulberry (Morus alba L.) with anti-oxidant, antimicrobial, anti-tumour, anti-inflammatory and antiallergic activity.OBJECTIVE: To determine the anti-TB efficacy of morusin on Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains.DESIGN: Anti-TB efficacy of morusin was tested on H37Ra (American Type Culture Collection [ATCC] 25177), H37Rv (ATCC 27294), ATCC 35822 (isoniazid [INH] resistant), ATCC 35838 (rifampicin [RIF] resistant), and ATCC 35820 (streptomycin [SM] resistant) standard strains and its efficacy was determined using nitrate reductase assay (NRA).RESULTS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of morusin was tested in the range of 53.83â-\"0.21 Î¼g/ml. The MIC for H37Ra (ATCC 25177), H37Rv (ATCC 27294) and ATCC 35838 (RIF-resistant) strains were found to be 6.72 Î¼g/ml, and this was 13.45 Î¼g/ml for the ATCC 35822 (INHresistant) and ATCC 35820 (SM-resistant) strains.CONCLUSION: To consider morusin as a viable alternative or precursor drug for TB treatment, it is imperative to conduct an exhaustive examination of its mechanism of action and conduct in vitro studies using clinical isolates.",

      "abstract": "Stilbene and benzofuran derivatives isolated from the root of white mulberry (Morus alba) have shown various biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties. The objectives of this study were to develop hairy root cultures and assess the effect of multiple elicitors combinations including (I) methyl-β-cyclodextrin (CD), MgCl2, methyl jasmonate (MeJA), and H2O2, (II) CD, MgCl2, and MeJA and (III) CD, MgCl2, and H2O2, on the production of these bioactive compounds. The highest yields of stilbenes and benzofurans were obtained upon co-treatment with 18 g/L CD, 3 mM H2O2 and 1 mM MgCl2. The stilbenes oxyresveratrol, resveratrol, and 3'-prenylresveratrol accumulated up to 6.27, 0.61, and 5.00 mg/g DW root, respectively. Meanwhile, the aryl benzofurans moracin M and moracin C accumulated up to 7.82 and 1.82 mg/g DW root, respectively. These stilbenes and benzofurans accumulated in the culture medium of the elicited hairy root cultures. They were not detected in the root tissue. However, the oxyresveratrol diglucoside mulberroside A was only detected in the root tissue with yields up to 10.01 mg/g DW. The results demonstrated that co-treatment of white mulberry hairy root cultures with multiple elicitors can significantly enhance production and secretion of stilbenes and benzofurans in this controlled and sustainable axenic culture system."

      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease affecting more people every year. The treatment of diabetes and its complications involve substantial healthcare expenditures. Thus, there is a need to identify natural products that can be used as nutraceuticals to prevent and treat early-stage diabetes. White mulberry (Morus alba L.) is a plant that has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years due to its many beneficial biological properties. White mulberry leaves are a source of 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), which, due to its ability to inhibit α-glucosidase, can be used to regulate postprandial glucose concentration. In addition to consuming dried white mulberry leaves as herbal tea, many functional foods also contain this raw material. The development of the dietary supplements market brings many scientific and regulatory challenges to the safety, quality and effectiveness of such products containing concentrated amounts of nutraceuticals. In the present study, the quality of 19 products was assessed by determining the content of DNJ, selected (poly)phenols and antioxidant activity (DPPH• assay). Nine of these products were herbal teas, and the other samples were dietary supplements. These results indicate the low quality of tested dietary supplements, the use of which (due to the low content of nutraceuticals) cannot bring the expected beneficial effects on health. Moreover, a method for determining the content of DNJ (the essential component for antidiabetic activity) based on ATR-FTIR spectroscopy combined with PLS regression has been proposed. This might be an alternative method to the commonly used chromatographic process requiring extraction and derivatization of the sample. It allows for a quick screening assessment of the quality of products containing white mulberry leaves.",

      "abstract": "Due to the rising prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, a strategy that can positively influence diet quality in a simple way is being explored, since a low glycemic index (GI) diet is advised in the dietoprophylaxis and diet therapy of diabetes. Methods: Twenty-three women with abdominal obesity participated in the study. The postprandial glycemic response and glycemic index were determined after three carbohydrate meals (noodle soup, white rice, strawberry sorbet) without or with the addition of a plant-base supplement (extracts of kidney bean, white mulberry leaf, and green coffee) with a potentially hypoglycemic effect. For two products (instant noodle soup and white rice), the addition of the plant supplement resulted in a reduction in glicemic iAUC values (respectively, by: 17.1%, p = 0.005 and 5.3%; p = 0.03; 40.6%, p = 0.004 and 5.3%, p = 0.019). However, this effect was not observed for strawberry sorbet. The blood glucose concentrations 30 min after the consumption of instant noodle soup and white rice with the plant-based formula addition significantly affected the GI value of tested meals (p = 0.0086, r = 0.53; p = 0.0096, r = 0.53), which may indicate the effect of this plant supplement on enterohormone and/or insulin secretion. Conclusion: A formula containing kidney bean, white mulberry leaves, and green coffee extracts may therefore be a notable factor in lowering postprandial glycemia and the GI of carbohydrate foods. However, further research is needed to determine for which food groups and meals its use may be most effective.",

Intraperitoneal injection of iron-dextran was administered in Swiss albino mice to induce iron-overload condition and the mice were further treated with MAME. MAME treatment significantly decreased liver iron, serum ferritin level, oxidative stress, and restored serum parameters and liver antioxidants. Moreover, biochemical and histopathological analyses confirmed the alleviated liver damage and fibrosis upon MAME treatment. The protective effect of MAME against iron-overload-induced apoptosis was confirmed by upregulation of protein levels of Bax, Caspase-3, and PARP. The treatment also affected the expression of MAPKs (ERK, JNK, and p38). GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of various bioactive phytochemicals in MAME that may be responsible for ameliorating effects of excess iron. Thus MAME can be envisaged as an effective iron chelator in the treatment of iron-overload-induced liver injury and fibrosis.",

The extract and fractions also markedly inhibited ROS generation and antioxidant activity. After treatment with the EtOH extract and its fractions, LPS stimulation-induced elevated nitric oxide (NO) production was restored, which was primarily mediated by downregulation of inducible NO synthase expression.

The elicitation result showed that extracellular oxyresveratrol was increased by adding 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin to the culture media of both free and immobilised M. alba callus (>730-fold and >169-fold, respectively) compared with those of the control. However, the intracellular mulberroside A levels in the treatment groups did not increase compared with those of the control. The results show that the addition of 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin significantly changed the patterns and levels of the stilbenoids in M. alba callus cultures.",

      "abstract": "White Mulberry Root-bark (WMR) is an edible Chinese herbal used for the treatment of inflammation, nephritis and asthma. This study aimed to investigate the inhibitory effects of ethanol extract from WMR against human carboxylesterase 2 (hCE2), as well as to identity and character natural hCE2 inhibitors in this herbal. Our results demonstrated that the ethanol extract of WMR displayed potent inhibitory effects against hCE2, while three major bioactive constitutes in WMR were identified on the basis of LC fingerprinting combined with activity-based screening of LC fractions. Three bioactive compounds including SD, KG and SC were efficiently identified by comparison of LC retention times, UV and MS spectral data, with the help of authentic standards. The inhibition potentials and inhibition types of these natural compounds against hCE2 were further investigated in human liver microsomes. The results demonstrated that these bioactive compounds are potent non-competitive inhibitors against hCE2, with the Ki values ranging from 0.76μM to 1.09μM. All these findings suggested that three abundant natural compounds in WMR displayed potent inhibitory effects against hCE2, which could be used as lead compounds to develop more potent hCE2 inhibitors for the alleviation of hCE2-mediated severe delayed-onset diarrhea.",

In Experiment 1, four diets, control and control supplemented with 2, 5, or 7 g MFE/kg dry matter (DM) of diet, were used. In Experiment 2, fish were intraperitoneally infected with Aeromonas hydrophila and fed the same diets as experiment 1 plus additional two diets with or without antibiotic. Results of experiment 1 showed that growth was unaffected by dietary levels of MFE. Treatments with the inclusion of MFE at the levels of 5 and 7 g/Kg DM had no mortality. Red blood cells (RBC), albumin, and total protein were all higher for the treatments fed MFE (5 and 7 g/Kg DM). Results of experiment 2 showed RBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit, globulin, albumin, and total protein improved with the increase in MFE in the infected fish. The dietary MFE at the level of 7 g/kg DM reduced mortality rate. In conclusion, MFE at the level of 7 g/kg DM could be a valuable dietary supplement to cure the infected fish.",

      "abstract": "Body weight is controlled by our genes and managed by a neuro-hormonal system, in particular by insulin and glucagon. The meristematic extract of Japanese white mulberry blocks the alpha-glucosidase and then the intestinal hydrolysis of polysaccharides, thereby reducing the glycaemic index of carbohydrates. The target of our research was to evaluate the adjuvant slimming effect of the extract of white Japanese mulberry in the dietetic treatment of some patients who are obese or overweight. 46 overweight people were enrolled and divided into two subgroups: the subjects of both subgroups were given an identical balanced diet of 1300 kcal: subjects of the subgroup alpha received 2400 mg of white Japanese mulberry extract, the subgroup b subjects receive placebo. Each subgroup was followed-up every 30 days at 30, 60 and 90 days of treatment. Both in the periodic inspections and in the final inspection measurements of body weight and waist circumference in all the subjects and thigh circumference in women only were repeated. All subjects repeated blood tests. In the subgroup alpha, weight loss was about 9 kg in 3 months, equal to approximately 10 percent of the initial weight, significantly higher than subgroup beta (P<0.0001); moreover, the plasma insulin and glucose curves of the volunteers in this subgroup at the end of the trial were lower than those performed at the time of enrolment. In the 20 women of the beta subgroup treated with only low-calorie diet and with placebo, weight reduction was globally of 3.2 kg, approximately equal to 3 percent of the initial weight; moreover, the blood glucose curves and the insulin curves showed a slight decline compared to baseline, but not so significantly as was the case for group alpha. Waist circumference and thigh circumference (in women) decreased in all participants, obviously more evidently in subjects who lost more kg. The extract of white Japanese mulberry may represent a reliable adjuvant therapy in the dietetic treatment of some patients who are obese or overweight.",
