      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized by chronic pain, which profoundly impacts patients' quality of life. The analgesic treatment for OA is an urgent clinical problem to be addressed. Glycine N-acyltransferase (GLYAT) is an enzyme that plays a vital role in facilitating biochemical reactions through the catalysis of glycine conjugation. Here, this study constructed an OA pain model using sodium monoiodoacetate (MIA) and discovered a significant upregulation of GLYAT in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of OA mice through transcriptomic sequencing. This study demonstrates GLYAT is predominantly expressed in DRG neurons and co-localizes with CGRP, IB4, or NF200-positive neurons. Overexpression of GLYAT leads to the development of prominent mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia. Loss of GLYAT effectively alleviates pain-like behaviors in OA mice without impairing baseline nociception and tactile sensations. Subsequent investigations show that GLYAT overexpression disrupts the redox balance and increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels within DRG neurons, leading to the upregulation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel. Furthermore, ROS clearance or TRPV1 blockade in GLYAT-overexpressing mice significantly increased mechanical withdrawal threshold and thermal withdrawal latency. Collectively, these results demonstrate that GLYAT regulates OA pain by increasing ROS production and TRPV1 channel expression. This work also suggests the potential of GLYAT as a novel target for analgesic therapies. PERSPECTIVE: This article highlights the innovative finding of increased GLYAT levels in DRG neurons of the mice with OA pain. The role of GLYAT in regulating ROS and TRPV1 levels suggests its potential as a target for managing OA pain."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating neurological disorder characterized by oxidative stress, inflammatory cascades, and metabolic dysregulation. Ginsenoside Rd (G-Rd) and chrysophanol (Chr), two natural compounds with antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, have demonstrated neuroprotective potential, however, their mechanisms in ICH remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of G-Rd and Chr against heme-induced injury in HT22 cells and in a rat model of ICH, with a focus on oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and metabolic regulation. METHODS: In vitro, HT22 cells were exposed with heme (10 μmol/L, 12 h) to simulate ICH injury, followed by treatment with G-Rd and Chr (80 μmol/L). Reactive oxygen species (ROS), apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential, and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10) were assessed using flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, and ELISA. In vivo, ICH was induced in rats via collagenase injection. Neurological function, hematoma volume, histopathology, and metabolic enzymes (SOD, MDA, NAD+, Ca2+-ATPase) were evaluated. Western blotting was used to analyze key enzymes in the serine-glycine-one‑carbon (SGOC) pathway. RESULTS: G-Rd and Chr significantly suppressed ROS production (P < 0.05), downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6; P < 0.01), and inhibited apoptosis (P < 0.01) in HT22 cells. Both compounds restored mitochondrial membrane potential and alleviated cellular damage. In the ICH rat model, combined treatment improved neurological scores by 45 % (P < 0.01), decreased hematoma volume by 38 % (P < 0.01), and restored metabolic homeostasis through modulation of SGOC pathway enzymes (PHGDH, PSAT1, PSPH, SHMT2; P < 0.05). Synergistic effects were observed in both hematoma resolution and neuroprotection. CONCLUSION: G-Rd and Chr confer neuroprotection in ICH through antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and metabolic regulatory mechanisms. Their synergistic efficacy underscores their promise as therapeutic candidates, meriting further investigation of their molecular targets and translational potential."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Captive cheetahs are prone to a range of unusual diseases potentially linked to unnatural diets high in muscle meat and low in collagen-rich animal fibre. In the wild, cheetahs typically eat whole prey diets not easily replicated in a captive setting. Glycine is the most abundant amino acid in collagen with a key role in several metabolic pathways such as collagen biosynthesis. Several recent studies suggest that endogenous glycine production may be limited in several species. OBJECTIVES: Using untargeted 1H- nuclear magnetic resonance, the metabolic changes in the urine and serum of 10 adult captive cheetahs on a glycine-supplemented diet were investigated. METHODS: Cheetahs were fed either a meat only (control) or glycine-supplemented meat diet (30 g glycine per 1 kg meat) for four weeks, followed by a four-week cross-over. Urine and blood samples were collected at baseline and after each intervention. RESULTS: A total of 151 and 60 metabolites were identified in the urine and serum, respectively. Specifically, dimethylsulphone, proline, fructose, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, pyroglutamic acid, 1,3-diaminopropane, dihydrothymine, methylmalonic acid and pimelic acid contributed to metabolome differences in the urine. In serum, glutamic acid, threonine, α-aminobutyric acid, glucose-6-phosphate, ethanolamine, methionine and propionic acid were highlighted. These metabolites play various metabolic roles in energy production, immune function, protein and collagen biosynthesis or as products of gut microbiome fermentation. CONCLUSION: Glycine supplementation influenced threonine sparing, pyrimidine biosynthesis pathways and bacterial fermentation products, although the implications of these findings on the health of captive cheetahs is unknown. Future studies should use a targeted approach to further elaborate on these pathways.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the improvement of aged skeletal muscle atrophy by High-intensity Interval Training (HIIT) combined with glycine supplementation. METHODS: Male C57BL/6 J mice aged 19 months (n = 16) were randomly assigned to Old Sedentary (OSED), HIIT, OSED+Glycine (O-Gly), and HIIT+Glycine (H-Gly) groups for an 8-week intervention. Maximum grip strength and running speed were assessed. Myocyte apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining; myofiber cross-sectional area was measured by laminin staining; reactive oxygen species (ROS) in myocytes were detected by dihydroethidium staining. Western blot and RT-qPCR were used to measure protein and gene expression levels related to senescence, apoptosis, and ferroptosis in myocytes. Chemical methods were employed to detect changes in Malondialdehyde (MDA), Lipid peroxide (LPO), glutathione (GSH), Glutathione-oxidized (GSSG), and total glutathione (T-GSH) contents. RNA-seq technology was utilized to screen for key differentially expressed genes. AutoDockTools software was used for molecular docking predictions between glycine and key differential proteins. RESULTS: H-Gly group mice showed an improved maximum grip strength and muscle fiber cross-sectional area, with a significant reduction in TUNEL-positive cells. RNA-seq analysis revealed a high correlation between ferroptosis pathway genes and Slc25a25 ion transport-related genes, which was further validated by the detection of ferroptosis-related markers. Molecular docking indicated that glycine has binding sites with Slc25a25, with the highest binding energy of -3.7 kcal/mol. CONCLUSIONS: Glycine supplementation has a significant synergistic effect with HIIT in increasing muscle mass and grip strength in aged muscle. The mechanism might be associated with the decrease of Slc25a25-mediated ferroptosis."

Developing strategies to enhance wheat's resilience to salinity is critical for maintaining yield in affected regions. This study investigates the potential of chitosan-proline (Cs-Pro) and chitosan-glycine (Cs-Gly) nanoparticles in mitigating salt stress in salt-tolerant Heydari and salt-sensitive Sepahan wheat cultivars, with a special question on genotype-dependent differences. Plants were treated with nanoparticles at concentrations of 0, 200, and 400 mg L⁻¹ under salt stress levels of 0, 200, and 400 mM NaCl. The salt-tolerant Heydari cultivar exhibited superior adaptability to saline conditions, in addition reacted more positively to nanoparticle treatments. Results demonstrated significant physiological improvements, including increased relative water content (RWC), enhanced chlorophyll content and elevated proline levels, especially after 400 mg L⁻¹ Cs-Pro treatment. Oxidative stress markers, such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide, were substantially reduced, while antioxidant enzyme activity was boosted. Certain stress-responsive genes (e.g., TaADC, TaPxPAO, TaSAMDC, TaSPDS, TaSOS1, TaNHX1) were upregulated, highlighting the importance of ionic balance and polyamine metabolism in improved stress tolerance. The application of Cs-Pro and Cs-Gly nanoparticles presents a promising approach to enhance wheat's salinity tolerance by improving physiological, biochemical, and molecular responses.",

The findings revealed that compared to the control group, at a 4% application rate, plant length decreased by 20%, while stem dry weight, root length and weight showed no significant differences up to a 2% application. Compared to the control treatment, the 4% application rate resulted in an increase of 6% in leaf temperature, 55% in NBI, 12% in chlorophyll content, and 10% in MDA activity. Conversely, the TAA, TPC, and carotenoid content decreased by 55%, 51%, and 81%, respectively. Salt applications led to reductions in most studied morphological parameters, except for root properties.

      "abstract": "Plants are constantly subjected to various abiotic stresses (drought, salinity, heavy metals and low temperature) throughout their life cycle, which significantly hinder their growth and productivity. Key abiotic stresses include drought, salinity, heavy metals, and extreme temperatures. In response, plants modulate glycine betaine (GB) levels, a vital compatible solute that influences growth and stress tolerance by interacting with phytohormones and cellular signaling pathways. Not all species can synthesize endogenous GB; however, some non-GB accumulating plants have been genetically modified to enhance GB production through the overexpression of synthesis genes such as choline oxidase, choline monooxygenase, and betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase. Exogenous GB treatment can mitigate stress effects by improving nutritional balance, reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS), minimizing membrane damage, and alleviating photoinhibition. Nonetheless, the specificity of GB application, transport, and accumulation across species, as well as its interaction with phytohormones in stress alleviation, remains uncertain. This review focuses on GB's role as an antioxidant, osmo-regulator, and nitrogen source, evaluating the physiological, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms by which GB mitigates abiotic stresses, aiming to develop GB-based strategies for enhancing plant stress resilience.",

      "abstract": "Glycine betaine (GB), a secondary metabolite that regulates plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, may help reduce pesticide phytotoxicity, but this fact remains unestablished. This study investigated the physiological response of rice (Oryza sativa) to six dosages of oxyfluorfen (OFF) (0-0.25 mg/L) and two concentrations of GB (0 and 175 mg/L). GB treatment counteracted the considerable decrease in rice seedling growth caused by OFF treatment at doses higher than 0.15 mg/L. The biochemical processes and catalytic events associated with OFF-triggered degradation in rice were investigated using RNA-Seq-LC-Q-TOF-HRMS/MS after six rice root and shoot libraries were created and subjected to either OFF or OFF-GB. Rice treated with both GB and an ecologically relevant dose of OFF showed a marked upregulation of 1039 root genes and 111 shoot genes compared with those treated with OFF alone. Multiple OFF-degradative enzymes implicated in molecular metabolism and xenobiotic tolerance to environmental stress were identified by gene enrichment analysis. In comparison to treated with 0.25 mg/L OFF alone, exogenous GB administration decreased OFF accumulation, with the OFF concentration in roots being 44.47 % and in shoots being 51.03 %. The production of essential enzymes involved in the OFF decay process was attributed to certain genes with variable expression, including cytochrome P450, methyltransferase, glycosyltransferases, and acetyltransferases. Using LC-Q-TOF-HRMS/MS, 3 metabolites and 16 conjugates were identified in metabolic pathways including hydrolysis, acetylation, glycosylation, and interaction with amino acids in order to enhance OFF-degradative metabolism. All things considered, by reducing phytotoxicity and OFF buildup, external GB treatment can increase rice's resistance to oxidative stress caused by OFF. This study offers valuable insights into the function of GB in enhancing OFF degradation, which may have ramifications for designing genotypes that maximize OFF accumulation in rice crops and promote OFF degradation in paddy crops."

      "abstract": "Soil salinity is one of the most challenging environmental factors affecting rice productivity, particularly in regions with high saline soils such as Egypt. The ability of rice to maintain high yield and quality under saline stress is often limited, leading to significant reductions in productivity. With the increasing salinization of agricultural lands, finding effective agronomic practices and treatments to mitigate salt-induced damage in rice crops is critical for ensuring food security. This study investigates the potential of exogenous glycine betaine (GB) and proline (Pro) applications to mitigate the adverse effects of salt stress on rice (cv. Sakha 108) over two consecutive growing seasons (2021-2022). Treatments of 30 mM GB and 30 mM Pro significantly enhanced dry weight (162.2 and 169.7 g in 2021 and 2022, respectively), plant height (88.94 and 99.00 cm), tiller number (10.58 and 10.33), and grain yield (4.22 and 4.30 t/ha) compared to control groups. Combined treatments of 30 mM GB and 30 mM Pro exhibited the greatest improvements across both years, with maximum dry weight (193.44 and 186.56 g), plant height (112.00 and 112.33 cm), tiller number (15.33 and 16.28), spikelet number per meter (264.00 and 264.05), thousand-kernel weight (70.00 and 73.2 g), and grain yield (6.17 and 6.64 t/ha). Additionally, the combined treatments resulted in the highest harvest index (53.22% in 2021 and 48.94% in 2022), amylose content (24.24% and 20.09%), and protein content (12.33% and 12.00%). Correlation analysis highlighted strong positive relationships among traits, such as plant height with grain yield (r = 0.94), biomass yield (r = 0.92), and harvest index (r = 0.90). Path analysis further demonstrated that thousand-kernel weight and biomass yield had the most significant direct effects on grain yield, with values of 0.43 and 0.42, respectively. Heatmap clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) confirmed the synergistic effects of combined GB and Pro treatments, with the 30P_30GB treatment consistently clustering with high-yield traits, enhancing nitrogen use efficiency and stress resilience. In conclusion, the combined application of glycine betaine and proline significantly enhances the agronomic and chemical traits of rice under salt stress. This study demonstrates that these osmoprotectants improve vegetative growth, grain yield, and quality, with synergistic effects observed at optimal concentrations. The findings highlight the potential of glycine betaine and proline as effective tools for improving salt tolerance in rice, offering practical solutions to address challenges in saline-affected agricultural regions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Drought stress is a catastrophic abiotic stressor that impedes the worldwide output of commodities and the development of plants. The Utilizing biological antioxidant stimulators, Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are one example increased the plants' ability to withstand the effects of drought. The symbiotic response of soybean (Glycine max L.) to AMF inoculation was assessed in the experiment presented herewith at different watering regimes (field capacity of 25, 50, and 90%). The vegetative, physio-biochemical traits, and regulation of genes involved in polyamine synthesis in G. max plants were evaluated. RESULTS: The results obtained suggested that AMF inoculation has an advantage over plants that were non-inoculated in terms of their growth and all assessed criteria, which responded to drought stress by showing slower development. It is evident that the gas exchange parameters of the soybean plant were substantially reduced by 36.79 (photosynthetic rate; A), 60.59 (transpiration rate; E), and 53.50% (stomatal conductance gs), respectively, under severe stress of drought in comparison to control; non-stressed treatment. However, the AMF inoculation resulted in a 40.87, 29.89, and 33.65% increase in A, E, and gs levels, respectively, in extremely drought-stressful circumstances, when in contrast to non-AMF one that was grown under well-watered conditions. The drought level was inversely proportional to mycorrhizal colonization. The total antioxidant capacity, protein, and proline contents were all enhanced by AMF inoculation, while the malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide contents were decreased. Polyamine biosynthesis genes expression; Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC2), Spermidine synthase (SPDS) and Spermine synthase (SpS) were upregulated in drought and to even higher level in AMF's mild drought inoculated plants' shoots. This implies that AMF plays apart in the enhanced survival of soybean plants stressed by drought and reduced plant membranes damage by limiting the excessive production of oxidative stress generators; ROS. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the present investigation demonstrates that inoculation of AMF may be a supportable and environmentally advantageous method for improving the physio-biochemical traits, plant growth, and polyamine biosynthesis genes of soybean plants in the incident of limited water availability."

      "abstract": "Reducing the ecological impact of dyes through wastewater discharge into the environment is a challenge that must be addressed in textile wastewater pollution prevention. Congo red (CR) dye is widely used in experimental studies for textile wastewater treatment due to its high organic loads used in its preparation. The degradation of organic dyes of the CR type was investigated using the photocatalytic activity of functionalized polymers. We have employed photodegradation procedures for both polymer-supported glycine groups (Code: AP2) and polymer-supported glycine-Zn(II) (Code: AP2-Zn(II)). A photocatalysis efficiency of 89.2% was achieved for glycine pendant groups grafted on styrene-6.7% divinylbenzene copolymer (AP2) and 95.4% for the AP2-Zn(II) sample by using an initial concentration of CR of 15 mg/L, a catalyst concentration of 1 g/L, and 240 min of photocatalysis. The findings provided here have shown that the two materials (AP2 and AP2-Zn(II)) may be effectively employed in the heterogeneous photocatalysis method to remove CR from water. From the perspective of the degradation mechanism of CR, the two photocatalysts act similarly."

Glycine plays a pivotal role in cell survival, and most anti-cancer agents alter glycine metabolomics and suppress cancer cell proliferation. Herein, we have utilized Frontier Molecular Orbital theory (FMO), and the results revealed that the introduction of acrylamide/divinyl benzene into the glycine-based polymer increased its biological activity by lowering the energy band gap. Heparanase and proteases are important in invasive tumor progression and worsening of prognosis. In this context, we have synthesized co-polymeric p(NAG-co-Ac) and revealed its protease inhibitory activities. It is revealed that the cross-linked homo-polymeric and cross-linked hetero-polymeric tetrameric arrangements inhibit heparanase activity via interacting at heparanase binding domain II (HBDII) with a docking score of ∼-11.08 kcal mol-1 (Ki) and at heparanase binding domain III (HBD III). The bathochromically shifted CD spectrum shows that the hydrogel interacts with heparanase and disturbs the secondary protein structure of the synthesized p(NAG-co-Ac) polymer. It is found that the synthesized p(NAG-co-Ac) hydrogel has anti-proliferative activity, acts as a migratory inhibitor of cancer cells, and favors programmed cell death. Further, the p(NAG-co-Ac) hydrogel exhibited anti-angiogenic behavior. In conclusion, p(NAG-co-Ac), with its anti-angiogenic and anti-tumorigenic capabilities, has a future as a potential anticancer polymer for the treatment of heparanase-driven invasive malignancies without using any additional anticancer drugs, and is promising for cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "Some amino acids have been shown to be signalling molecules in various developmental and stress processes, besides their roles in plant nutrition. Glycine is absorbed by pulvinar motor cells of Mimosa pudica according to an H+-Gly cotransport mechanism and under the control of calcium availability. Noteworthy, glycine triggers early plasma membrane depolarization and H+ migration. The unicellular model of protoplasts isolated from pulvini absorbed glycine with characteristics similar to those determined on multicellular motor tissues, considering metabolism regulation, plasma membrane functionality and calcium control. This model allows to observe that a rapid increase of glycine uptake rate occurs in the first 3 min following 10 mM glycine application. Additionally, we monitored a rapid transient increase (within 5-11 s) of the cytoplasmic free calcium ([Ca2+]c) measured by cytofluorimetric determination using Indo-1-loaded protoplasts. The low [Ca2+]c increase seen in nominally Ca2+-free medium and the inhibition of [Ca2+]c increase after treatment with channel inhibitors (LaCl3, nifedipine) argue for a Ca2+ mobilization from external stores. This observation emphasized the signalling role of glycine at the plasma membrane site."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The significance of serine and glycine metabolism in cancer cells is increasingly acknowledged, yet the quantification of their metabolic flux remains incomplete, impeding a comprehensive understanding. This study aimed to quantify the metabolic flux of serine and glycine in cancer cells, focusing on their inputs and outputs, by means of Combinations of C-13 Isotopes Tracing and mathematical delineation, alongside Isotopically Nonstationary Metabolic Flux Analysis. RESULTS: In HeLa cells, serine uptake, the serine synthesis pathway (SSP), and other sources (e.g., protein degradation) contribute 71.2 %, 24.0 %, and 5.7 %, respectively, to serine inputs. Conversely, glycine inputs stem from uptake (45.6 %), conversion from serine (45.1 %), and other sources (9.4 %). Serine input flux surpasses glycine by 7.3-fold. Serine predominantly directs a major fraction (94.7 %) to phospholipid, sphingolipid, and protein synthesis, with only a minor fraction (5.3 %) directing towards one-carbon unit and glycine production. Glycine mainly supports protein and nucleotide synthesis (100 %), without conversion back to serine. Serine output rate exceeds glycine output rate by 7.3-fold. Serine deprivation mainly impairs output to synthesis of phospholipid and sphingolipid, crucial for cell growth, while other outputs unaffected. AGS cells exhibit comparable serine and glycine flux to HeLa cells, albeit lacking SSP activity. Serine deprivation in AGS cells halts output flux to phospholipid, sphingolipid, protein synthesis, completely inhibiting cell growth. CONCLUSIONS: By providing quantitative insights into serine and glycine metabolism, this study delineates the association of serine flux to different metabolic pathway with cancer cell growth and offers potential targets for therapeutic intervention, highlighting the importance of serine flux to pathway for the synthesis of phospholipids and sphingolipids in cancer cells growth.",

      "abstract": "Studies have revealed that inhibition of glycine transporter type 1 (GlyT1) may provide a balanced regulation between excitation and inhibition in some brain structures and, thereby, modulate seizure activity. Data on the role of GlyT1 in epilepsy are, however, very limited. Here, we examined the effect of SSR504734, a highly selective and reversible GlyT1 inhibitor, on three acute seizure tests in mice. We also evaluated its impact on neurotransmitter levels in the relevant brain structures following seizures, possible adverse effects, and changes in the levels of inflammatory mediators in the serum and liver. In addition, in vivo pharmacokinetic profile and in vitro ADME-Tox properties of SSR504734 were investigated. The results show that SSR504734 significantly increased the threshold for tonic hindlimb extension in the MEST test after acute and repeated treatment but had no influence on seizure thresholds in the 6 Hz and i.v. PTZ seizure tests. SSR504734 did not affect the levels of glutamate, GABA, glycine, or adenosine in brain structures of mice with MES-induced seizures. However, after acute treatment, the concentration of glutamate and adenosine in the brainstem of control animals (i.e., without seizures) decreased. Moreover, SSR504734 increased the levels of inflammatory markers (TNF-α, Il-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TLR4) in serum. In vivo pharmacokinetic profiling and in vitro ADME-Tox data confirmed suitable drug-like properties of SSR504734, including its notable penetration into brain tissue. However, possible hepatotoxicity at higher doses should be taken into account. Further studies should be considered to better characterize the SSR504734-mediated effects as well as to validate GlyT1 as a potential new molecular target in epilepsy treatment.",

      "abstract": "Persimmon fruit is highly susceptible to chilling injury (CI) during cold storage. Notably, glycine betaine (GB), a compound that helps regulate cell osmotic balance, can alleviate postharvest CI in various fruits. In this study, the postharvest application of GB increased chilling tolerance, delayed CI, and reduced the CI index in 'Youhou' sweet persimmon fruit during cold storage. Moreover, GB treatment markedly decreased the O2 -· production rate and malondialdehyde (MDA) and H2O2 content while significantly increasing the ascorbic amounts of acid and glutathione (GSH). Compared with the control group, GB treatment increased activities of antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). GB treatment also reduced the activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, polyphenol oxidase, and peroxidase. RNA sequencing revealed that GB treatment significantly altered gene expression linked to sugar metabolism, GSH metabolism, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. This study provides novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms of GB treatment alleviating CI in postharvest persimmon fruit. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: 'Youhou' sweet persimmons are prone to rapid softening after harvest. This softening process can be limited through cold storage; this can also result in chilling injury (CI). The research findings suggest that glycine betaine (GB) treatment delays 'Youhou' persimmon fruit softening and alleviates CI during cold storage. GB application could be a feasible technique for extending the storage life of 'Youhou' sweet persimmon fruit.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The presence of treatment resistance in neuropsychiatric disease suggests that novel mechanism-based discoveries and therapies could benefit the field, with a viable candidate being transfer RNA (tRNA) epitranscriptomics. Nsun2 tRNA methyltransferase depletion in mature neurons elicits changes in complex behaviors relevant for fear, anxiety, and other neuropsychiatric phenotypes. However, it remains unclear whether this is due to dysregulated tRNAs or metabolic shifts that impact the neuronal translatome by activation of stress messengers together with alterations in amino acid supply. METHODS: To link specific molecular alterations resulting from neuronal Nsun2 ablation to neuropsychiatric phenotypes, we used drug-induced phosphoactivation of stress response translation initiation factors together with disruption of NSUN2-regulated glycine tRNAs and cell type-specific ablation of the glycine cleavage system modeling the excessive upregulation of this amino acid in the Nsun2-deficient brain. Changes in extracellular glycine levels were monitored by an optical glycine Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensor in the hippocampus, and behavioral phenotyping included cognition, anxiety-like behavior, and behavioral despair. RESULTS: Increased motivated escape behaviors were specifically observed in mice with neuron-specific ablation of Gldc, resulting in an excess in cortical glycine levels comparable to a similar phenotype in mice after deletion of neuronal Nsun2. None of these phenotypes were observed in mice treated with tunicamycin for chemoactivation of integrative stress response pathways or in mice genetically engineered for decreased glycine tRNA gene dosage. In the Nsun2-deficient brain, dynamic glycine profiles in the hippocampal extracellular space were fully maintained at baseline and in the context of neuronal activity. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in neuronal glycine metabolism, resulting from targeted ablation of the glycine cleavage system or disruption of the tRNA regulome, elicit changes in complex behaviors in mice relevant for neuropsychiatric phenotypes."

This article combines experiments and theoretical calculations to reveal the importance of hydrogen bonds between silane coupling agents and the matrix polyamide 6 in improving the mechanical properties of composite materials. Firstly, glycine bridged silane (GBSilane) was synthesized and the structure was confirmed by FT-IR, 1H NMR and HRMS. Secondly, with glass fiber treated using GBSilane as a filler, the mechanical properties of glass fiber/PA6 composite materials were studied. Compared with untreated glass fiber/PA6 composites, under the optimal treatment concentration of 1.5%, the tensile strength of glass fiber/PA6 composites treated with 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES) and GBSilane increased by 41% and 67%, respectively, and the notch impact strength increased by 55% and 96.5%, respectively. Lastly, density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that stronger hydrogen bonds have formed between GBSilane and PA6 than APTES, which have induced the stronger PA6-GBSilane binding energy of 58.20 kJ mol-1. By comparison, the binding energy of PA6-APTES is only 30.91 kJ mol-1. These results demonstrated that the as-synthesized GBSilane could improve the mechanical properties of PA6 composites through an enhanced hydrogen bonding mechanism."

Merr] is one of the most important crops in the world due to its importance as food and feed. One of the major limiting factors for soybean production is drought, which can cause up to 80% reduction in yield. Therefore, growers and plant breeders are turning to soybean accessions that demonstrate better water use efficiency (WUE). However, in addition to drought, insect herbivory by soybean looper (Chrysodeixis includens, SBL) and fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda, FAW) can also reduce soybean yield by feeding on foliar and floral organs. Using soybean accessions that differ in their wilting speed, we examined the relationship between physiological traits associated with WUE, and how they affect both herbivore and host plant growth and development. Results showed that both fast- and slow-wilting genotypes displayed strong overcompensation in terms of growth and development, but slow-wilting genotypes produced higher-quality pods and seeds. Regardless of treatment effects, FAW fed at a significantly higher rate than SBL despite being less specialized to feed on soybeans. While fast-wilting plants produced more pods than slow-wilting plants regardless of treatment, slow-wilting plants produced heavier pods with larger and heavier seeds. Collectively, we show that despite fast-wilting plants overcompensating in pod production and growth traits, slow-wilting plants may still be better fit through seed functions."

In this investigation, 30 female ICR mice were divided into four groups: a control group and three Ultraviolet B (UVB)-exposed groups treated with saline or M-Gly via intraperitoneal injection for 30 days. At the end of the experiment, UVB exposure caused erythema, wrinkling, collagen degradation, and mast cell infiltration in mouse dorsal skin. M-Gly treatment improved skin appearance and reduced mast cell numbers, while also elevating antioxidant levels, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione (GSH). Furthermore, M-Gly reduced inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-1β, typically upregulated after UVB exposure. M-Gly also protected skin collagen by upregulating type I procollagen and decreasing MMP-1 levels. Skin metabolomic profiling identified 34 differentially abundant metabolites, and transcriptomic analysis revealed 752 differentially expressed genes. The combined metabolomic and transcriptomic data indicate that M-Gly's protective effects may involve the regulation of ion transport, cellular repair, metabolic stability, collagen preservation, and the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. These findings highlight M-Gly's potential as an endogenous antioxidant for protecting skin from UVB-induced damage."

      "abstract": "Gastric cancer is a common digestive system tumor with a high resistance rate that reduces the sensitivity to chemotherapy. Nutrition therapy is an important adjuvant approach to favor the prognosis of gastric cancer. Dietary amino acids contribute greatly to gastric cancer progression by mediating tumor gene expressions, epigenetics, signal transduction, and metabolic remodeling. In the present study, 20 types of amino acids were screened and glutamine, glycine and serine were identified as the critical regulators of cisplatin (DDP) sensitivity in gastric cancer cells. Moreover, KDM4A acetylation drove the reduced chemotherapy sensitivity in gastric cancer cells by maintaining protein stability and activating DNA repair ability when the concentrations of glutamine (Gln), serine (Ser), and glycine (Gly) decreased. Conversely, Gln/Ser/Gly at increasing concentrations stimulated ubiquitination degradation of KDM4A, which in turn elevated the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to chemotherapy. Our findings unveiled the role of amino acid nutrition in regulating chemotherapy sensitivity of gastric cancer and the underlying mechanism, thus providing a scientific basis for expanding the clinical significance of nutrition therapy for gastric cancer patients.",

Green-synthesized ZnO NPs were laboratory synthesized and characterized by FTIR, XRD, EDX, SEM, TEM and TGA analyses. Electrospinning of PVA/SA with optimized mixing ratios was further carried out with different ratios of ZnO NPs of (0.25, 0.50 and 0.75%, wt./v) to fabricate SA/PVA/ZnO composite nanofibers. The formula of NF of (SA/PVA/ZnO (0.75%) with different ratios of glycine was used for testing as topical wound dressing as promised biomaterials. Results revealed that NF formula coded AS3.3; composed of (10%PVA/1.5%SA/10%CA/0.75%ZnO/0.5% glycine), in contrast to all the other formulations examined; showed marked reduced percentages of biofilm development of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in relation to fungal cells. The relative viable count for Bacillus cereus (98.40 ± 0.51%), Salmonella paratyphi (98.33 ± 0.79%), and Candida albicans (94.29 ± 0.76%) decreased significantly after 36-hour of incubation period with AS3.3 treatment.

Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effects of the cadmium (Cd)-resistant PGPR strain Leclercia adecarboxylata HW04 (>4 mM Cd resistance) on soybean plants exposed to 300 μM Cd. HW04 was observed to possess the innate ability to synthesize indole-3-acetic acid and exopolysaccharides, which facilitated the absorption of Cd in the medium. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed that HW04 effectively colonized the porous structure of BC. Their combined treatment significantly enhanced photosynthesis and improved the morphological characteristics of soybean plants. Additionally, the Cd content in soybean shoots significantly increased following both the sole or combined treatments of BC and HW04. However, the combined treatments significantly reduced Cd content in the roots and soil by 31% and 47%, respectively. HW04 inoculation alone increased Cd content in the roots by 43.7% while lowering it in the soil by 7.4%. Additionally, the co-application of HW04 and BC significantly enhanced calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) assimilation while promoting Cd/Fe accumulation in soybean shoots. The higher expression of signaling cascade genes, including GmCaMK1 and GmCDPK5 (Ca signaling) and GmMAPK4a and GmMAPK7 (MAP kinase signaling), in the co-applied crops further validate the findings. The increase in abscisic acid levels and the decrease in salicylic acid levels after HW04 and BC application were correlated with enhanced stress tolerance in crops. These findings suggest that the combined application of HW04 and BC could serve as an effective, eco-friendly approach for mitigating heavy metal toxicity in crops and promoting phytoremediation.",

This study aimed to elucidate the potential mechanism of RG in hypoxia injury through a combined approach of metabolomics and network pharmacology. Initially, a CoCl2-induced cell hypoxia model was established, and the therapeutic impact of RG on biochemical indices was evaluated. Subsequently, metabolomics analysis of cell samples was conducted to identify biomarkers, and network pharmacology was employed to identify potential targets of RG for hypoxia treatment. Finally, the key target and pathway were verified. The study revealed that RG could reverse CoCl2-induced abnormalities in biochemical indicators. Metabolomics analysis identified 13 biomarkers and seven metabolic pathways associated with RG treatment. Utilizing network pharmacology, five key targets and five metabolic pathways were identified, partially aligning with the metabolomics results. Molecular docking results demonstrated the effective binding of RG to the key targets. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay verified that RG could exert antihypoxia effect by activated PI3K/Akt pathway. In conclusion, this integrated strategy, combining metabolomics with network pharmacology, sheds light on the protective mechanism of RG against hypoxia-induced cellular damage.

However, the ability of these reagents to dissociate IgM antibodies sensitized to RBCs has not been comprehensively elucidated. We investigated whether EGA and CDP could dissociate cold-reactive antibodies from RBCs and their effect on RBCs after dissociation treatment. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Cold-reactive antibody-sensitized RBC samples were prepared by mixing group A RBCs and group B plasma and treated with EGA, CDP, and dithiothreitol (DTT). Before and after the dissociation treatment, changes in the agglutination of these RBCs were assessed using the test tube method. Flow cytometric analysis was used to confirm the nature of antibodies bound to RBCs. Additionally, RBC morphology was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy. This study utilized off-label use of EGA and CDP. RESULTS: Flow cytometric analysis showed that antibodies sensitized to RBCs were mainly IgM antibodies. After antibody dissociation, agglutination disappeared in the EGA-treated samples to the same degree as in the DTT-treated samples. However, IgM antibodies remained in the CDP-treated samples. Regarding RBC morphology, RBC surface appeared coarser in both EGA- and CDP-treated samples, and RBC area was significantly smaller in the CDP-treated samples than in the EGA-treated samples. DISCUSSION: EGA could dissociate cold-reactive antibodies, whereas CDP had a higher residual antibody content. This difference in dissociation ability appears to correlate with the antibody pH of the dissociation reagent. EGA treatment may be useful in cases of sensitization by high-titer cold-reactive antibodies.",

This study demonstrates the potential of a king grass-Serratia marcescens strain S27 (KS) co-symbiotic system to enhance heavy metal remediation. The KS symbiosis increased the biomass of king grass by 48 % and enhanced the accumulation of Cd and Cr in the whole plant by 2.75-fold and 1.82-fold, respectively. Root exudates like γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine betaine (GB), and allantoin (Alla) were tested for enhancing the KS symbiotic, with 0.75 mM GB (GB3X-KS) showing the highest removal efficiencies at 15.1 % for Cd and 14.2 % for Cr. Correlation analysis indicated a link between this enhancement and increased soil nitrogen content. Mechanistic studies revealed GB treatment altered the rhizosphere microbial community, promoting denitrifying bacteria and upregulating nitrogen transformation genes (nrfA) by over 7-fold. GB also enhanced nitrogen assimilation enzymes and antioxidant defenses in king grass, facilitating Cd and Cr transport and sequestration. X-ray fluorescence imaging and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy showed GB promoted Cd and Cr accumulation in the xylem and phloem of king grass, with phenols and alcohols as key functional groups. The study highlights the potential of the GB-KS symbiotic system for effective soil remediation.",

Glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) is a mitochondrial enzyme that takes part in the oxidation of glycine to support nucleotide biosynthesis via transfer of one-carbon units. Herein, we aimed to investigate the potential role of GLDC in RCC development. We found that GLDC depletion diminished nucleotide synthesis and promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation to repress RCC progression, which was reversed by repletion of deoxynucleosides. Additionally, in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that GLDC plays an important role in regulation of proliferation and tumor growth via interferon stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3)-mediated pathway. Expressions of interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) were elevated in GLDC knock-downed cells and decreased in GLDC over-expressed cells. Double knock-down of STAT2 and IRF9 in GLDC-deficient cells rescued GLDC depletion-induced decrease in cell proliferation. Furthermore, GLDC depletion increased cisplatin-and doxorubicin-induced DNA damage through ISGF3 pathway, leading to cell cycle dysregulation and increased mitotic catastrophe. These findings reveal that GLDC regulates RCC progression via ISFG3-mediated pathway and offers a promising strategy for RCC treatment.",

Given the substantial energy consumption during the process of SNF, legumes need to optimize nodule number in response to everchanging environmental scenarios. The TGACG BINDING FACTOR1/4 (TGA1/4) are key players in the basal immune response of plants. In this study, both β-glucuronidase staining and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) demonstrated that both GmbZIP4a and GmbZIP4b are inducible upon rhizobial inoculation. To investigate their roles further, we constructed gmbzip4a/b double mutants using CRISPR/Cas9 system. Nodulation assessments revealed that these double mutants displayed a reduction in the number of infection threads, which subsequently resulted in a decreased nodule number. However, the processes associated with nodule development including nodule fresh weight, structural characteristics, and nitrogenase activity, remained unaffected in the double mutants. Subsequent transcriptome analyses revealed that zeatin biosynthesis was downregulated in gmbzip4a/b mutants post rhizobial inoculation. Supporting these findings, genes associated with cytokinin (CTK) signaling pathway were upregulated in Williams 82 (Wm82), but this upregulation was not observed in the double mutants after rhizobial treatment. These results suggest that GmbZIP4a/b positively influences nodule formation by promoting the activation of the CTK signaling pathway during the early stages of nodule formation.",

However, WPCBs also contain valuable metallic elements, making them important resources for recycling. To address the dual challenge of hazardous waste management and resource recovery, sustainable approaches for metal extraction from WPCBs are imperative. The present study, thus aimed to explore the use of glycine as an environment-friendly alternative to conventional inorganic acid-leaching agents for copper extraction from WPCBs. The integration of glycine leaching with pre-treatment under supercritical conditions with methanol enhanced the copper liberation efficiency along with improved mass transfer processes. Under optimized conditions of 0.5 M glycine concentration, 5 % (v/v) H2O2 concentration, 1.5:100 g/mL solid-to-liquid ratio, and 40 °C temperature, a remarkably high copper extraction efficiency of 97.46 % was achieved within a 15 h leaching duration. Besides, the kinetic studies indicated a mixed-controlled reaction mechanism for the metal extraction process, with a calculated activation energy of 40.01 kJ/mol. Additionally, a thorough characterization of the recovered metal-leached salt provided insights into the compound's nature and leaching mechanism. This integrated approach developed thus offers a sustainable and environment-friendly method for reducing the hazardousness of WPCBs while simultaneously extracting valuable metals, contributing to the advancement of e-waste management practices and environmental sustainability.",

Glycine betaine (GB), an osmotic regulator, is widely applied in crop resistance to abiotic stress. This study investigates the role of GB and its biosynthetic enzyme CsBADH in enhancing cold tolerance in tea plants. Two cultivars, 'Shuchazao' (cold-resistant) and 'Baiye 1' (cold-sensitive), were subjected to low temperature stress (0 °C). GB accumulation was measured, revealing that 'Shuchazao' exhibited 1.4-fold higher GB levels than 'Baiye 1', suggesting a link between higher GB accumulation and cold tolerance. Exogenous GB treatment improved cold resistance, especially in the cold-sensitive cultivar 'Baiye 1'. The CsBADH gene, a key enzyme in GB biosynthesis, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, confirming its activity. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana, Nicotiana tabacum, and C. sinensis plants overexpressing CsBADH showed increased GB levels (1.5- to 2.4-fold), proline content, peroxidase (POD) activities, and enhanced cold tolerance, while silencing CsBADH decreased GB accumulation and cold resistance. These findings demonstrate that CsBADH plays a critical role in cold stress response by promoting GB accumulation, offering potential strategies for improving the resilience of tea and other leaf crops to cold stress.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this work was to check the effects of five Bradyrhizobium japonicum inoculants from different producers on growth, photochemical efficiency, nitrate reductase activity, amount of hydrogen peroxide, activity of catalase, non-specific peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase, seed yield, and nodulation of soybean cv. 'Malaga'. We also evaluated expression of such nodulation genes as NIC1, NOD21, and NORKb. The following inoculants were used: Nitragina IUNG, Nitragina Biofood, Nitroflora Mycoflor, Rhizobium Bio-Gen, and HiStick® Soy. The study was carried out on plants grown in pots in an open foil tunnel or glasshouse conditions. Experimental seeds were inoculated before sowing, while the control ones were not. Physiological and biochemical analyses involved the leaves, and gene expression was investigated in the roots. The bacterial inoculants significantly affected individual parameters of chlorophyll a fluorescence. The highest photochemical efficiency was induced by Nitroflora Mycoflor, which also activated nitrate reductase to the greatest extent. Nitragina IUNG most strongly stimulated accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, facilitated formation of the greatest number of nodules, and improved seed yield per plant in comparison with the control and other inoculants. Of the studied nodulation genes, NIC1 showed the strongest expression following HiStick®Soy treatment. Nitragina Biofood and Nitragina IUNG most significantly reduced the expression of all studied genes. Expression of NOD21 and NORKb exposed to other inoculants was the same as in the control plants. High content of hydrogen peroxide can be considered a marker of the inoculant ability to increase nodulation and yield of soybean. Commercial preparations containing the same amount of B. japonicum but different carriers of bacteria show different ability to form root nodules, and their differential impact on yield is related to the intensity of nodulation and expression of the Nod genes.",

      "abstract": "Difluorinated sulfonamide porphyrin (F2PGly) and bacteriochlorin (F2BGly), modified by glycine residues, were synthesized and evaluated for photodynamic therapy (PDT). F₂PGly exhibits superior stability and singlet oxygen generation efficiency but features a low-intensity band in the red range (λmax = 639 nm). In contrast, F2BGly shows a favorable, red-shifted absorption spectrum (λmax = 746 nm) that aligns well with phototherapeutic window, facilitating deeper tissue penetration. Moreover, it demonstrates reasonable photostability, necessary for the efficient generation of both singlet oxygen (type II) and oxygen-centered radicals (type I mechanism) which contributes to enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Importantly, the glycine modifications in F2BGly enhance its uptake in MCF-7 cells, known for their resistance to PDT due to efflux transport proteins like LAT1, showing great potential in the cancer cell-targeted PDT. The glycine groups potentially enable F2BGly to bypass these barriers, resulting in increased intracellular accumulation and more effective Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generation under illumination. In vivo studies indicated promising vascular-targeted PDT results, with real-time fluorescence imaging used to monitor photosensitizer distribution prior to irradiation. These findings suggest that F2BGly is a promising photosensitizer candidate with enhanced cancer cell selectivity and photodynamic efficiency, meriting further exploration in targeted PDT applications for multiple types of cancers.",

      "abstract": "Trypanosoma cruzi is a flagellated protozoan and the etiological agent of Chagas disease, a neglected tropical disease described by Carlos Chagas in 1909 that remains without appropriate diagnostics and treatment. Throughout its life cycle, T. cruzi undergoes through many different environments, requiring adaptation of its metabolism to different nutrition sources. Recent studies have confirmed the adaptability of T. cruzi metabolism to different carbon sources and encouraged a deeper investigation of related metabolic pathways. In the present study, we investigated the catabolism of threonine in T. cruzi epimastigotes cultivated in LIT medium and following 24h of starvation in PBS. In LIT medium, threonine, serine, and histidine were rapidly consumed concomitantly with carbohydrates during parasite exponential growth. When threonine was provided as the only carbon source to starved parasites, they excreted acetate and glycine, corroborating the activity of a mitochondrial threonine degradation pathway. Subsequently, we used a recombinant T. cruzi L-threonine dehydrogrenase (TcTDH) to screen the Chagas Box, an open-source collection of phenotypic hits, and identified compound TCMDC-143160 as a low micromolar TcTDH inhibitor (IC50 = 3.5 μM). When TCMDC-143160 was administrated to starved parasites, it inhibited the threonine degradation pathway. Finally, we report the crystal structure of TcTDH and characterize its allosteric activation by potassium. Collectively, these data demonstrate the relevance of threonine catabolism in T. cruzi metabolism and provide a set of tools to further investigate TcTDH as a potential drug target for Chagas disease.",

The ingestion and accumulation of nanoplastics in crops can contaminate the food chain and have unintended consequences for human health. In this study, we revealed the effects of polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs; 80 nm) at different concentrations (0, 10, 100 mg L-1) on soybean (Glycine max L.) seedling growth, antioxidant enzyme system and secondary metabolism. Using laser confocal microscopy, we demonstrated that the absorption and translocation of PS-NPs in soybean. Plant growth inhibition was observed by changes in plant height, root length, and leaf area after 7 days of exposure to PS-NPs. The effect of PS-NPs on photosynthetic characteristics was reflected by a significant reduction in total chlorophyll content at 10 mg L-1. Activation of the antioxidant system was observed with increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and elevated activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). Non-targeted metabolomics analysis identified a total of 159 secondary metabolites, and exposure to 10 and 100 mg L-1 PS-NPs resulted in the production of 61 and 62 differential secondary metabolites. Metabolomics analysis showed that PS-NPs treatment altered the secondary metabolic profile of soybean leaves through the biosynthesis pathways of flavonoid, flavone flavonol, and isoflavones, which is expected to provide new insights into the tolerance mechanisms of plants to nanoplastics. Overall, the results of this study deepen our understanding of the negative impacts of nanoplastics in agricultural systems, which is crucial for assessing the risks of nanoplastics to ecological security.",

Collagen, predominantly synthesized and secreted in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), relies on glycine as a crucial constituent. Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) serves as a pivotal transcriptional regulator in amino acid metabolism. Therefore, our objective is to explore the impact of AdipoRon on ATF4-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress and amino acid metabolism in HSCs. We induced liver fibrosis in mice through intraperitoneal injection of CCl4 and administered AdipoRon (50 mg/kg) via gavage. In vitro studies were predominantly conducted using LX-2 cells. Our findings demonstrated that AdipoRon effectively suppressed ATF4-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress in HSCs and assumed a crucial role in hindering serine/glycine biosynthesis. Interestingly, this inhibitory effect of AdipoRon on serine/glycine biosynthesis is regulated by PSAT1-mediated glutaminolysis, resulting in a subsequent decrease in collagen synthesis within HSCs. This study provides potential mechanistic insights into the treatment of liver fibrosis with AdipoRon.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Diabetes mellitus is associated with systemic complications, including the development of pulmonary injury, characterized mainly by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix components and inflammatory cell infiltration in lung tissue. This process is driven by oxidative stress and chronic inflammation, both caused and exacerbated by hyperglycemia. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and glycine, known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, offer potential therapeutic benefits in mitigating diabetes-induced lung injury. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to investigate the effects of supplementation by either NAC or glycine or their combination on reducing lung injury in rats with type 1 diabetes Materials and methods: The study used 30 adult Wistar albino rats (10 weeks old, weighing between 180 g and 380 g). Six of them were used as controls, while 24 adult rats (10 weeks old, 180-380 g) with type 1 diabetes, induced through a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) at a dose of 55 mg/kg, were randomly assigned to four experimental groups: control (CTL), diabetic (Db), NAC treatment (diabetic+NAC), glycine treatment (diabetic+glycine), and combined NAC and glycine treatment (diabetic+NAC+glycine). NAC (100 mg/kg) and glycine (250 mg/kg) were administered orally for 12 weeks. At the end of the study, lung tissues were collected for histopathological examination. Qualitative, semi-quantitative, and stereological histological analysis was used to analyze structural changes in the lung tissue. Semi-quantitative scoring was carried out to evaluate the extent of inflammation, while stereological analysis was performed to determine the volume density of alveolar spaces and septal connective tissue. The semi-quantitative scoring included scores ranging from 0 (absent), 1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe). RESULTS: Qualitative histological analysis revealed pronounced inflammation and fibrosis in the lungs of untreated diabetic rats, characterized by thickened alveolar septa and immune cell infiltration. Both treatments with NAC and glycine individually reduced inflammation and fibrosis compared to untreated diabetic rats. The greatest improvement was observed in the NAC+glycine group, where the alveolar structure appeared almost normal, with minimal inflammation. Semiquantitative analysis showed statistically significant differences in peribronchial and peribrochiolar infiltrates between the diabetic group (2.16±0.47) and the control group (0.33±0.21, p=0.026). The combination of NAC and glycine significantly reduced peribronchial and peribronchiolar infiltrates (0.33±0.33, p=0.026) compared to the diabetic group. Similarly, septal inflammatory infiltrates were significantly lower in the NAC+glycine group (1±0.36) compared to diabetic rats (3.33±0.33, p=0.004). Total airway inflammatory infiltration was also significantly reduced in the NAC+glycine group (1.33±0.33, p=0.002) compared to the diabetic group (5.5±0.5). CONCLUSION: As the combination of NAC and glycine demonstrated protective effects against lung inflammation and fibrosis in diabetic rats, a synergistic effect of NAC and glycine in mitigating pulmonary complications associated with type 1 diabetes may be suggested. These findings warrant further exploration of the combination for managing diabetic lung disease and potentially other fibrotic conditions."

The glutamate-serine-glycine (GSG) index has emerged as a non-invasive diagnostic marker for NAFLD, but its ability to monitor treatment response remains unclear. This study investigates the GSG index's ability to monitor NAFLD's response to bariatric surgery. METHODOLOGY: Ten NAFLD participants were studied at baseline and 6 months post-bariatric surgery. Blood samples were collected for serum biomarkers and metabolomic profiling. Hepatic steatosis [proton density fat fraction (PDFF)] and fibroinflammation (cT1) were quantified with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), and hepatic stiffness with magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). Amino acids and acylcarnitines were measured with mass spectrometry. Statistical analyses included paired Student's t-test, Wilcoxon-signed rank test, and Pearson's correlation. RESULTS: Eight participants provided complete data. At baseline, all had hepatic steatosis (BMI 39.3 ± 5.6 kg/m2, PDFF ≥5%). Post-surgery reductions in PDFF (from 12.4 ± 6.7% to 6.2 ± 2.8%, p = 0.013) and cT1 (from 823.3 ± 85.4 ms to 757.5 ± 41.6 ms, p = 0.039) were significant, along with the GSG index (from 0.272 ± 0.03 to 0.157 ± 0.05, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The GSG index can potentially be developed as a marker for monitoring the response of patients with NAFLD to bariatric surgery.",

Despite their significant potential, integrin-targeted therapies have faced substantial challenges in clinical trials, including variable efficacy and unmet high expectations. Nevertheless, the consistent expression of integrins on tumor and stromal cells underscores their ongoing relevance and potential. Traditional RGD-based imaging and therapeutic agents have faced limitations, such as inconsistent target expression and rapid systemic clearance, which have reduced their effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, recent research has focused on advancing RGD-based strategies and exploring innovative solutions. This review offers a thorough analysis of the latest developments in the RGD-integrin field, with a particular focus on addressing previous limitations. It delves into new dual-targeting approaches and cutting-edge RGD-based agents designed to improve both tumor diagnosis and therapeutic outcomes. By examining these advancements, this review illuminates new pathways for enhancing the specificity and efficacy of integrin-targeted therapies, paving the way for more effective cancer diagnosis and treatment strategies."

Soybean is one of the major plants providing nutrition for humans and livestock globally. In this study, we overexpressed a novel GASA gene (GmGASA1-like) in Glycine max and conducted bioinformatic analyses, evaluated the T2 transgenic line in an open field, and applied major stressors along with the growth promoter GA3 to investigate the potential functions of the GmGASA1-like gene. The results of bioinformatics implied that the GmGASA1-like gene is regulated by GA3, and its protein has the potential to influence key processes of plant growth and development. The transgenic plants (JN74-OE) were significantly taller and had a larger canopy in the field trial at the R1-growth stage and demonstrated superiority in some seed quantity and quality traits after harvesting. Under abiotic stresses (including cold, heat, and drought) and spraying of GA3, the level of GmGASA1-like gene expression in JN74-OE exceeded the levels measured before the treatments. Notably, the highest expression level was observed during the drought stress treatment. Photosynthesis pigments levels in both the overexpressed lines and the control group showed no significant differences. In summary, this study sheds light on the multifaceted roles of the GmGASA1-like gene, impacting soybean plant architecture, seed traits, and stress responses. Ultimately, this research paves the way for a more productive and sustainable soybean industry."

Growing evidence suggests that zinc (Zn) supplementation may serve as a potential drought stress management strategy in agriculture. Field studies were conducted using soybean (Glycine max var. Saba) as a model crop to test whether foliar application of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) or conventional Zn fertilizer (ZnSO4) would mitigate drought-related water stress and improve soybean yield. Each fertilizer was foliar applied twice at a two-week interval during the flowering stage. Experiments were concurrently conducted under non-drought conditions (70% field capacity) for comparison. Results showed drought significantly reduced relative water content, chlorophyll-a, and chlorophyll-b in untreated control plants by 35.7%, 47.7%, and 41.4%, respectively, compared to non-drought conditions (p < 0.05). Under drought conditions, ZnO-NPs (200 mg Zn/L) led to 33.1% and 20.7% increase in chlorophyll-a and chlorophyll-b levels, respectively, compared to ZnSO4 at 400 mg Zn/L. Likewise, catalase, peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities increased by 62.6%, 39.5% and 28.5%, respectively, with ZnO-NPs (200 mg Zn/L) under drought compared to non-drought conditions. Proline was significantly increased under drought but was remarkably suppressed (~ 54% lower) with ZnO-NPs (200 mg Zn/L) treatment. More importantly, the highest seed yield was observed with ZnO-NPs (200 mg Zn/L) treatment under drought (39% higher than untreated control) and non-drought (79.4% higher than control) conditions. Overall, the findings suggest that ZnO-NPs could promote seed yield in soybean under drought stress via increased antioxidant activities, increased relative water content, decreased stress-related proline content, and increased photosynthetic pigments. It is recommended that foliar application of 200 mg Zn/L as ZnO-NPs could serve as an effective drought stress management strategy to improve soybean yield.",

      "abstract": "The serine/glycine (ser/gly) synthesis pathway branches from glycolysis and is hyperactivated in approximately 30% of cancers. In ~13% of glioblastoma cases, we observed frequent amplifications and rare mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme PSPH, which catalyzes the last step in the synthesis of serine. This urged us to unveil the relevance of PSPH genetic alterations and subsequent ser/gly metabolism deregulation in the pathogenesis of glioblastoma. Primary glioblastoma cells overexpressing PSPH and PSPHV116I showed an increased clonogenic capacity, cell proliferation, and migration, supported by elevated nucleotide synthesis and utilization of reductive NAD(P). We previously identified sertraline as an inhibitor of ser/gly synthesis and explored its efficacy at suboptimal dosages in combination with the clinically pretested chloroquine to target ser/glyhigh glioblastoma models. Interestingly, ser/glyhigh glioblastomas, including PSPHamp and PSPHV116I, displayed selective synergistic inhibition of proliferation in response to combination therapy. PSPH knockdown severely affected ser/glyhigh glioblastoma clonogenicity and proliferation, while simultaneously increasing its sensitivity to chloroquine treatment. Metabolite landscaping revealed that sertraline/chloroquine combination treatment blocks NADH and ATP generation and restricts nucleotide synthesis, thereby inhibiting glioblastoma proliferation. Our previous studies highlight ser/glyhigh cancer cell modulation of its microenvironment at the level of immune suppression. To this end, high PSPH expression predicts poor immune checkpoint therapy responses in glioblastoma patients. Interestingly, we show that PSPH amplifications in glioblastoma facilitate the expression of immune suppressor galectin-1, which can be inhibited by sertraline treatment. Collectively, we revealed that ser/glyhigh glioblastomas are characterized by enhanced clonogenicity, migration, and suppression of the immune system, which could be tackled using combined sertraline/chloroquine treatment, revealing novel therapeutic opportunities for this subgroup of GBM patients."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: An importance of tillage, inorganic and organic nutrient sources in the mustard - soybean cropping system lies in their ability to enhance soil fertility, improve nutrient availability, optimize crop growth and yield, and promote sustainable agricultural practices. Any cropping system's sustainability could be increased by implementing better management techniques like zero and reduced tillage with residue retention and better nutrient sources. RESULTS: A field experiment was conducted for four consecutive seasons (Winter 2019 to Rainy 2021) to compare the two enhanced management practices, zero and reduced tillage to conventional tillage across four levels of nutrient sources: 75 and 100% recommended dose of nitrogen through FYM and 75 and 100% recommended dose of fertilizers through urea, single super phosphate and muriate of potash in a two years experiment. Experiment results were evaluated in terms of nutrient status, profitability and productivity of Mustard-Soybean cropping system. The results show a substantial improvement in yield, nutrient status, and overall yield performance of mustard and soybean when using the full recommended dose of fertilizers combined with reduced tillage and mulching, compared to other treatment methods. The implementation of reduced tillage practices recorded significantly higher yield of mustard and soybean over conventional and zero tillage. CONCLUSION: System productivity and profitability i.e. mustard equivalent yield, productivity, gross returns, net returns, profitability and B: C (benefit: cost) was found to be improved with reduced tillage and 100% recommended dose of fertilizer under reduced tillage practices. To enhance cropping system productivity in various sub-humid regions worldwide, farmers can adopt reduced tillage techniques combined with the full recommended dose of fertilizers (100% RDF).",

In this study, we investigated the effects of the foliar application of 2,4-epibrassinolide (EBR) on salt-stressed pepper seedlings. Our findings revealed that EBR treatment significantly increased the levels of proline, sugar, and glycine betaine under salt stress compared to untreated controls. Moreover, EBR enhanced the antioxidant defense mechanisms in pepper seedlings by increasing sugar and glycine betaine levels, which contributed to the reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation."

      "abstract": "Background. Urinary collagen peptides, the breakdown products of endogenous collagen, have been used as biomarkers for various diseases. These non-invasive biomarkers are easily measured via mass spectrometry, aiding in diagnostics and therapy effectiveness. Objectives. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of consuming collagen-containing meat on collagen peptide composition in human blood and urine. Methods. Ten collagen peptides in 24 h urine were quantified. Results. Prolyl-hydroxyproline (Pro-Hyp) was the most abundant peptide. Except for hydroxyprolyl-glycine (Hyp-Gly), levels of other minor collagen peptides showed high correlation coefficients with Pro-Hyp (r = 0.42 vs. r > 0.8). Notably, 24 h urinary Hyp-Gly showed a correlation coefficient of r = 0.72 with meat consumption, significantly higher than the coefficient for Pro-Hyp (r = 0.37). Additionally, the levels of Pro-Hyp and Hyp-Gly in the blood of seven young women participants increased similarly after consuming fish meat, while before ingestion, only negligible amounts of Hyp-Gly were present. To examine which peptides are generated by the degradation of endogenous collagen, mouse skin was cultured. The amount of Pro-Hyp released from the skin was approximately 1000-fold higher than that of Hyp-Gly. Following consumption of collagen-containing meat, both Pro-Hyp and Hyp-Gly are released in blood and excreted into urine, although Pro-Hyp is primarily generated from endogenous collagen even under physiological conditions. Conclusions. Therefore, in 24 h urine samples, the non-negligible fraction of Pro-Hyp is contributed by endogenous collagen, making 24 h urine Hyp-Gly level a potential biomarker for evaluating meat consumption on the day.",

      "abstract": "AIM: Accumulation of circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) is a hallmark feature of impaired insulin sensitivity. As intracellular BCAA catabolism is dependent on glycine availability, we hypothesised that the concurrent measurement of circulating glycine and BCAA may yield a stronger association with markers of insulin sensitivity than either BCAA or glycine alone. This study therefore examined the correlative relationships of BCAA, BCAA and glycine together, plus glycine alone on insulin sensitivity-related markers before and after an 8-week low energy diet (LED) intervention. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of the PREVIEW (PREVention of diabetes through lifestyle Intervention and population studies in Europe and around the World) Study New Zealand sub-cohort. Eligible participants with pre-diabetes at baseline who achieved ≥8 % body weight loss following an LED intervention were included, of which 167 paired (Week 0 and Week 8) blood samples were available for amino acid analysis. Glycemic and other data were retrieved from the PREVIEW consortium database. Repeated measures linear mixed models were used to test the association between amino acids and insulin sensitivity-related markers (HOMA2-IR, glucose, insulin, and C-peptide). RESULTS: Elevated BCAA was associated with impaired insulin sensitivity (p < 0.05), with strength of association (ηp2) almost doubled when glycine was added to the model. However, glycine in isolation was not associated with insulin sensitivity-related markers. The magnitude (β-estimates) of positive association between BCAA and HOMA2-IR, and inverse association between glycine and HOMA2-IR, increased when body weight was higher (Body weight∗BCAA, Body weight∗glycine, p < 0.05, both). CONCLUSION: Low serum glycine strengthened the association between BCAA and impaired insulin sensitivity. Given that glycine is necessary to facilitate intracellular BCAA catabolism, measurement of glycine is necessary to complement BCAA analysis to comprehensively understand the contribution of amino acid metabolism in insulin sensitivity.

Studies have shown that rhizobium-preinoculated soybean plants usually exhibit improved salt tolerance, but the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. In this paper, transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that preinoculation with rhizobia affected polyamine (PA) metabolism in soybean roots. The assay of PA contents showed that preinoculation with rhizobia significantly increased the putrescine (Put) content in roots and leaves during short-term salt treatment (0-5 d). Long-term salt treatment (5-7 d) resulted in a high Put content and significantly increased Spm and Spd contents, resulting in a rapid increase in the Put/(Spd + Spm) ratio (0-5 d) and subsequent decrease. Moreover, rhizobium preinoculation of soybean plants resulted in increased contents of conjugated and bound PAs under salt stress. Further transcriptome sequencing, PA contents, PA synthase expression and activity analysis revealed that GmADC may be a key gene related to salt tolerance in rhizobium-preinoculated soybean plants, and the GmADC-overexpressing soybean hairy-root composite plants exhibited less ROS damage, lower Cl-/NO3- ratios and Na+/K+ ratios, and stabilized ion homeostasis. Taken together, preinoculation with rhizobia increased the expression level and enzyme activity of arginine decarboxylase (ADC) in soybean roots, increased the content of Put in roots and leaves, and increased the content of conjugated and bound PAs in soybean plants, thereby alleviating the oxidative and ionic injuries of soybean plants and enhancing the salt tolerance.",

Here we show that chronic cannabidiol (CBD) administration significantly mitigates cognitive deficiency and hippocampal β-amyloid (Aβ) pathology in 5×FAD mouse model of AD. CBD achieves its curative effect mainly through potentiating the function of inhibitory extrasynaptic glycine receptor (GlyR) in hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). Based on the in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological recording and calcium imaging, CBD mediated anti-AD effects via GlyR are mainly accomplished by decreasing neuronal hyperactivity of granule cells in the DG of AD mice. Furthermore, the AAV-mediated ablation of DG GlyRα1, or the GlyRα1S296A mutation that exclusively disrupts CBD binding, significantly intercepts the anti-AD effect of CBD. These findings suggest a GlyR dependent mechanism underlying the therapeutic potential of CBD in the treatment of AD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Group 3 medulloblastoma (MBGRP3) represents around 25% of medulloblastomas and is strongly associated with c-MYC (MYC) amplification, which confers significantly worse patient survival. Although elevated MYC expression is a significant molecular feature in MBGRP3, direct targeting of MYC remains elusive, and alternative strategies are needed. The metabolic landscape of MYC-driven MBGRP3 is largely unexplored and may offer novel opportunities for therapies. METHODS: To study MYC-induced metabolic alterations in MBGRP3, we depleted MYC in isogenic cell-based model systems, followed by 1H high-resolution magic-angle spectroscopy (HRMAS) and stable isotope-resolved metabolomics, to assess changes in intracellular metabolites and pathway dynamics. RESULTS: Steady-state metabolic profiling revealed consistent MYC-dependent alterations in metabolites involved in one-carbon metabolism such as glycine. 13C-glucose tracing further revealed a reduction in glucose-derived serine and glycine (de novo synthesis) following MYC knockdown, which coincided with lower expression and activity of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), the rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway. Furthermore, MYC-overexpressing MBGRP3 cells were more vulnerable to pharmacological inhibition of PHGDH compared to those with low expression. Using in vivo tumor-bearing genetically engineered and xenograft mouse models, pharmacological inhibition of PHGDH increased survival, implicating the de novo serine/glycine synthesis pathway as a pro-survival mechanism sustaining tumor progression. Critically, in primary human medulloblastomas, increased PHGDH expression correlated strongly with both MYC amplification and poorer clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a MYC-induced dependency on the serine/glycine pathway in MBGRP3 that represents a novel therapeutic treatment strategy for this poor prognosis disease group.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Soybean is a rich source of bioactive components with good nutritional support and is easily available. In the treatment of cancer, green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from plant-based samples has gained attentions due to its potency and feasibility. In the present study, using soybean extracts (GM), silver nanoparticles are synthesized and analyzed for their anticancer potency. METHODS: The synthesized GM-AgNPs were characterized via UV-Vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) techniques for further analysis. Antibacterial activity was evaluated using the disc method and anti-hemolysis activity using the in vitro method, followed by anticancer property evaluation by cytotoxicity, cell migration, apoptosis, and cell cycle. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our results showed that the synthesized GM-AgNPs were spiral-shaped with a size range of 5-50 nm. The antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae showed the maximum zone of inhibition at 250 μg/mL in comparison with gentamicin. On exploring the anti-hemolysis efficiency, at 200 μg/mL, GM-AgNPs showed no hemolysis in comparison to the extract which showed 40% hemolysis. On analysis of GM-AgNPs against the breast cancer cell line, the nanoparticles displayed the IC50 value of 74.04 μg/mL. Furthermore, at the IC50 concentration, cancer cell migration was reduced. The mechanism of action of GM-AgNPs confirmed the initiation of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the sub-G0/G1 (growth phase) phase by 48.19%. In gene expression and protein expression analyses, Bax and Bcl-2 were altered to those of normal physiology."

      "abstract": "The potential biological properties of protein hydrolysates have generated considerable research interest. This study was to hydrolyze black soybean protein (BSP) using five different commercial enzymes, and elucidate the influence of these enzymes on the structure and biological activities of the resulting hydrolysates. Enzymatic treatment changed secondary and tertiary structures of BSP, decreased particle size, α-helix and β-sheet. Alcalase hydrolysate had the highest hydrolytic degree (29.84 %), absolute zeta potential (38.43 mV), the smallest particle (149.87 nm) and molecular weight (<3 kDa). In silico revealed alcalase hydrolysate had the strongest antioxidant potential. This finding was further validated through the lowest IC50 (mg/mL) in DPPH (2.67), ABTS (0.82), Fe2+ chelating (1.33) and·OH (1.12). Moreover, cellular antioxidant assays showed alcalase hydrolysate had the strongest cytoprotective effects on H2O2-induced PC12 cells. These results suggest BSPEHs, especially those prepared by alcalase, have potential as bioactive ingredients for nutrition, healthcare and food industry.",

      "abstract": "Modern laboratory medicine relies on analytical instruments for bacterial detection, focusing on biosensors and optical sensors for early disease diagnosis and treatment. Thus, Density Functional Theory (DFT) was utilized to study the reactivity of glycine interacted with metal oxides (ZnO, MgO, and CaO) for bacterial detection. Total dipole moment (TDM), frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), FTIR spectroscopic data, electronic transition states, chemical reactivity descriptors, nonlinear optical (NLO) characteristics, and molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) were all investigated at the B3LYP/6-31G(d, p) level using DFT and Time-Dependent DFT (TD-DFT). The Coulomb-attenuating approach (CAM-B3LYP) was utilized to obtain theoretical electronic absorption spectra with the 6-31G(d, p) basis set to be more accurate than alternative quantum chemical calculation approaches, showing good agreement with the experimental data. The TDM and FMO investigation showed that glycine/CaO model has the highest TDM (10.129Debye) and lowest band gap (1.643 eV). The DFT computed IR and the experimental FTIR are consistent. The calculated UV-vis spectra showed a red shift with an increase in polarity following an increase in the absorption wavelength due to the interaction with ZnO, MgO, and CaO. Among the five solvents of water, methanol, ethanol, DMSO and acetone, the water and DMSO enhances the UV-Vis absorption. Glycine/CaO model showed high linear polarizability (14.629 × 10-24esu) and first hyperpolarizability (23.117 × 10-30esu), indicating its potential for nonlinear optical applications. The results showed that all model molecules, particularly glycine/CaO, contribute significantly to the development of materials with potential NLO features for sensor and optoelectronic applications. Additionally, MESP confirmed the increased electronegativity of the studied structures. Additionally, glycine/ZnO nanocomposite was synthesized and characterized using IR and UV-visible spectroscopy to determine their structural and spectroscopic features. It was discovered that there was good agreement between the DFT computed findings and the related experimental data. The antibacterial activity of glycine/ZnO nanocomposites against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied in terms of concentration and time. The results showed that increasing the concentration of glycine/ZnO nanocomposite significantly enhanced its antibacterial efficacy by lowering optical density. Notably, Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibited lower susceptibility to the nanocomposite compared to S. aureus, requiring higher concentrations for effective bactericidal action. In summary, this study contributes novel insights into the dual functionality of glycine-metal oxide complexes, with significant implications as optical biosensor for microbial detection.",

      "abstract": "AIM: Peri-implant mucositis, a dysbiosis-driven inflammatory disease, is a precursor to peri-implantitis, underscoring the need for early disease management. Therefore, we investigated the efficacy of glycine powder in resolving clinical inflammation and restoring host-microbial homeostasis. METHODS: Thirty subjects were randomized to receive either glycine powder air-abrasive debridement or ultrasonic instrumentation. Clinical parameters (probe depth [PD], modified Sulcular Bleeding Index [mSBI], modified Plaque Index [mPlI]), biofilm and peri-implant crevicular fluid were collected at baseline and at 1-day, 1-, 3-, 6-weeks and 3- and 6-months post-therapy. Microbial recolonization was examined using 16S rDNA sequencing and immune response was semi-quantified using a bead-based 17-plex microarray. RESULTS: At 6-months, both groups demonstrated non-significant reductions in mSBI when compared to baseline (p > 0.05, Wald test, mixed model for repeated measures). However, mSBI and PD decreased in the test group from week-1 to 3-months, while control group decreased at 1- and 3-weeks only. mSBI was lower in the test group when compared to controls from Week-1 to 3-months, while PD differed between groups at 6 weeks and 3-months. Glycine group demonstrated significant microbial shifts after 24-h, increases in species richness and health-compatible species, and loss of pathobionts (p < 0.001, Dunn test). Pro-inflammatory cytokines decreased from 1- to 6-weeks or 3-months (p < 0.05, Wald test). Comparable results were obtained in the ultrasonic group at 3-weeks and sustained over 6-weeks post-therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Glycine therapy leads to early and sustained change in host-microbial interactions when compared to ultrasonics, however, the changes wrought by both therapies were sustained for a maximum of 3 months.

To reveal the effect of applying dicarboxylic acids as stress priming agents on a metabolic level in soybean leaf extracts, the chemical profile of methanolic extracts were collected at different time points (1 h, 2 h, 12 h, 24 h, 1 week, 2 weeks and 3 weeks) after spraying were analyzed using 1H-NMR based metabolomics by way of PCA and OPLS-DA. The OPLS-DA revealed several metabolites, including organic acids (fumarate, citrate and malate) and amino acids (asparagine, alanine and GABA), which accumulated in higher amounts, with fumarate accumulating the highest in Glycine max L. leaf extracts compared to untreated leaves. Denaturing 1DE gels were prepared for MS-based protein analysis and the presence of fatty acids (linolenic, oleic and α-linolenic acid) were confirmed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), which served as jasmonic acid precursors. The MS-based profiling of proteins on the denaturing 1DE gels revealed several proteins that were differentiated between the treated and untreated leaf extracts. These proteins included ferritins, CaM, ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase and chalcone-flavanone isomerase 1A. Following the treatment, fumarate was significantly elevated at 12 h to 3 weeks, compared to other compounds. It is, therefore, proposed that elevated quantities of fumarate could be related to the KEAP1-NRF2 metabolic pathway. This study represents the initial investigation of the effect of dicarboxylic acid application as a stress priming agent on Glycine max L. using 1H-NMR metabolomic analysis, GC-MS and proteomic analysis."

A greenhouse and pot experiment was designed using a randomize complete block design with factorial 2 × 3 treatments and three replications. The experimental treatments comprised two rates of biochar (35 and 70 g/pot) and three rates of organic fertilizer (70, 105, and 140 g/pot). After 100 days of amendment of strongly acidic soils, the results showed that application of treatments B35F70 and B70F140 increased soil pH by 16.80% compared to the control group (CK). On the other hand, treatments B35F140 and B70F105 resulted in an increase of soil electrical conductivity by 66.67% compared to CK. In addition, after 100 days of amendment with treatments B35F105, B35F105, B35F140, B70F105, B70F70, B70F70, and B35F140, organic matter, available phosphorous (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn), organic matter, available phosphorous (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn), significantly increased when compared to the control group (CK). Treatment B35F140 increased relative leaf chlorophyll content and soybean seed weight per plant by 60.76% and 100.56%, respectively when compared to the CK. Furthermore, treatment B35F70 produced 125% more root nodules than CK. Moreover, each amended strongly acid soil resulted with a significant upsurge in total soil bacteria compared to the CK.

Five hundred sixty broiler chickens at 21 d old were randomly allotted to 5 treatments with 8 replicates. Birds in a positive control (PC) treatment were raised under low stock density (16.9 birds/m2 per cage) with recommended environmental conditions, whereas birds in 4 treatments were subjected to multiple stress conditions: a cyclic heat stress of 30 ± 0.3 °C for 10 h and 23 ± 0.2 °C for 14 h per day with high stock density (25.3 birds/m2 per cage). A basal diet was assigned to both PC and negative control (NC) treatments. Three additional diets were individually formulated to contain double concentrations of digestible Thr, Trp, or Gly + Ser compared with their concentrations in the basal diet. The experiment lasted for 14 d. Results showed that NC treatment had less growth performance (P < 0.001), jejunal goblet cell counts (P = 0.018), and trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER; P < 0.001), but greater (P = 0.026) feather corticosterone (CORT) concentrations than PC treatment. Thr treatment showed the least (P < 0.001) feed conversion ratio (FCR) among treatments under multiple stress conditions. Thr, Trp, and Gly treatments had less (P = 0.026) feather CORT concentrations, but had greater (P < 0.001) TEER than NC treatment. In conclusion, increasing concentrations of dietary Thr, Trp, or Gly improve the growth performance and intestinal health in broiler chickens with decreasing stress response under multiple stress conditions."

      "abstract": "Salinity stress represents a major threat to crop production by inhibiting seed germination, growth of seedlings, and final yield and, therefore, to the social and economic prosperity of developing countries. Recently, plant growth-promoting substances have been widely used as a chemical strategy for improving plant resilience towards abiotic stresses. This study aimed to determine whether melatonin (MT) and glycine betaine (GB) alone or in combination could alleviate the salinity-induced impacts on seed germination and growth of maize seedlings. Increasing NaCl concentration from 100 to 200 mM declined seed germination rate (4.6-37.7%), germination potential (24.5-46.7%), radical length (7.7-40.0%), plumule length (2.2-35.6%), seedling fresh (1.7-41.3%) and dry weight (23.0-56.1%) compared to control (CN) plants. However, MT and GB treatments lessened the adverse effects of 100 and 150 mM NaCl and enhanced germination comparable to control plants. In addition, results from the pot experiments show that 200 mM NaCl stress disrupted the osmotic balance and persuaded oxidative stress, presented by higher electrolyte leakage, hydrogen peroxide, superoxide radicals, and malondialdehyde compared to control plants. However, compared to the NaCl treatment, NaCl+MT+GB treatment decreased the accumulation of malondialdehyde (24.2-42.1%), hydrogen peroxide (36.2-44.0%), and superoxide radicals (20.1-50.9%) by up-regulating the activity of superoxide dismutase (28.4-51.2%), catalase (82.2-111.5%), ascorbate peroxidase (40.3-59.2%), and peroxidase (62.2-117.9%), and by enhancing osmolytes accumulation, thereby reducing NaCl-induced oxidative damages. Based on these findings, the application of MT+GB is an efficient chemical strategy for improving seed germination and growth of seedlings by improving the physiological and biochemical attributes of maize under 200 mM NaCl stress.",

Utilizing beneficial microorganisms like Piriformospora indica (P. indica) to enhance plant tolerance to abiotic stresses is a highly effective method, but the influence of P. indica on the growth of soybean in natural saline-alkaline soil remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effects of non-inoculation, P. indica inoculation, and fertilization on the growth, antioxidant defense, osmotic adjustment, and photosynthetic gas exchange parameters of soybean under two different levels of saline-alkaline stress in non-sterilized natural saline-alkaline soil. The study found that: 1) P. indica inoculation significantly promoted soybean growth, increasing plant height, root length, and biomass. Under mildly saline-alkaline stress, the increases were 11.5%, 16.0%, and 14.8%, respectively, compared to non-inoculated treatment. Under higher stress, P. indica inoculation achieved the same level of biomass increase as fertilization, while fertilization only significantly improved stem diameter. 2) Under saline-alkaline stress, P. indica inoculation significantly increased antioxidant enzyme activities and reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Under mildly stress, MDA content was reduced by 47.1% and 43.3% compared to non-inoculated and fertilized treatments, respectively. Under moderate stress, the MDA content in the inoculated group was reduced by 29.9% and 36.6% compared to non-inoculated and fertilized treatments, respectively. Fertilization only had a positive effect on peroxidase (POD) activity. 3) P. indica inoculation induced plants to produce more osmotic adjustment substances. Under mildly stress, proline, soluble sugars, and soluble proteins were increased by 345.7%, 104.4%, and 6.9%, respectively, compared to non-inoculated treatment. Under higher stress, the increases were 75.4%, 179.7%, and 12.6%, respectively. Fertilization had no significant positive effect on proline content. 4) With increasing stress, soybean photosynthetic capacity in the P. indica-inoculated treatment was significantly higher than in the non-inoculated treatment, with net photosynthetic rate increased by 14.8% and 37.0% under different stress levels. These results indicate that P. indica can enhance soybean's adaptive ability to saline-alkaline stress by regulating ROS scavenging capacity, osmotic adjustment substance content, and photosynthetic capacity, thereby promoting plant growth. This suggests that P. indica has great potential in improving soybean productivity in natural saline-alkaline soils."

Despite this, no licensed or readily available antiviral medication is currently available specifically for DENV infection, and therapy is typically symptomatic. Therefore, the objective of the study was to investigate the antiviral activity of Beta vulgaris L. phytoconstituents against DENV-2 targeting NS3 protein. The antiviral activity of phytochemicals was examined through virtual ligand-based screening, antiviral inhibition and dosage response assays, western blotting analysis and MD simulations. We conducted toxicological, and pharmacokinetic analysis to assess plant-based natural compound's efficacy, safety, and non-toxic doses. Molecular docking and MD simulation results revealed that the nonstructural protein-3 (NS3) might prove as a funamental target for Betanin and Glycine Betaine against Dengue virus. Betanin and Glycine betaine were initially studied for their non-toxic doses in HeLa, CHO, and Vero cells via MTT assay. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with cloned vector pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+)/DENV-2 NS3 along with non-toxic doses (80 μM-10 μM) of selected phytochemicals. The dose-response assay illustrated downregulated expression of DENV-2 NS3 gene after administration of Betanin (IC50 = 4.35 μM) and Glycine Betaine (IC50 = 4.49 μM). Dose response analysis of Betanin (80 μM-10 μM) depicted the significant inhibition of NS3 protein expression as well. These results suggested downregulated expression of DENV-2 NS3 at mRNA and protein level portraying the DENV replication inhibition. Based on our study findings, NS3 protease is depicted as distinctive DENV-2 inhibitor target.

METHODS: We report clinico-pathologic findings of a PERM patient with coexisting GlyR and GAD65 antibodies. RESULTS: A 75-year-old man presented with myoclonus and pain of the legs, subsequently developed severe motor symptoms, hyperekplexia, a pronounced startle reflex, hallucinations, dysautonomia, and died 10 months after onset despite extensive immunotherapy, symptomatic treatment, and continuous intensive care support. Immunotherapy comprised corticosteroids, IVIG, plasmapheresis, immunoadsorption, cyclophosphamide, and bortezomib. Intensive care treatment and permanent isoflurane sedation was required for more than 20 weeks. CNS tissue revealed neuronal loss, astrogliosis and microgliosis, representing a pallido-nigro-dentato-bulbar-spinal degeneration pattern, specifically along GlyR and GAD expression sites. Neurons showed pSTAT1, MHC class I, and GRP78 upregulation. Inflammation was moderate and characterized by CD8+ T cells and single CD20+/CD79a+ B/plasma cells. Focal tau-positive thread-like deposits were detected in gliotic brainstem areas. In the spinal cord, GlyR, glycine transporter-2, and GAD67 expression were strongly reduced. DISCUSSION: A possible potentiating effect of pathogenic GlyR antibodies together with T cells directed against neurons may have led to the severe and progressive clinical course.",

      "abstract": "Chromium and arsenic are among the priority pollutants to be controlled by regulatory and health agencies due to their ability to accumulate in food chains and the harmful effects on health resulting from the ingestion of food contaminated with metals and metalloids. In the present work, four biohybrid membrane systems were developed as alternatives for the removal of these pollutants, three based on polyvinyl alcohol polymeric mesh (PVA, PVA-magnetite, PVA L-cysteine) and one based on polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT), all associated with bioremediation agents. The efficiency of the bioassociation process was assessed through count methods and microscopy. The removal capacity of these systems was evaluated in synthetic liquid medium, both in the absence and in the presence of soybean (Glycine max L.) seedlings. The content of chromium and arsenic was also analyzed in aerial and hypogeous tissues of seedlings grown on contaminated solid substrate. PVA and PVA-magnetite biohybrid membranes showed the highest removal rates, between 57 and 75% of the initial arsenic content and more than 80% of the initial chromium content after 48 h of treatment, when evaluated in synthetic liquid media with initial concentrations of 2.5 ppm of pentavalent arsenic and 5 ppm of hexavalent chromium, both in presence and absence of seedlings. PVA and PBAT promoted a significant reduction of arsenic translocation to the aerial parts, generally edible, of this crop of agronomic interest. The systems tested showed a high potential for biotechnological applications in matrices affected by the presence of arsenic and chromium.",

      "abstract": "Trypsin inhibitors (TI) in raw soybean grain, mainly represented by the Kunitz trypsin inhibitor protein (KTI), prevent the normal activity of the digestive enzymes trypsin and chymotrypsin in humans and monogastric livestock. The inactivation of TI is achieved through costly and time-consuming heat treatment. Thermal processing also impairs the solubility and availability of the soybean grain protein. Therefore, the genetic elimination of KTI has been proposed as a suitable alternative to heat treatment. The aim of this study was to screen the collection of European soybean cultivars with six genetic markers (one SSR marker and five SNP markers) previously proposed as tightly linked to the KTI3 gene encoding the major Kunitz trypsin inhibitor seed protein of soybean and validate their usability for marker-assisted selection (MAS). The six markers were validated on a subset of 38 cultivars with wide variability in KTI content and in the F2 and F3:5 progenies of two crosses between the known high- and low-KTI cultivars. Three genetic markers (SSR Satt228 and two SNP markers, Gm08_45317135_T/G and Gm08_45541906_A/C) were significantly associated with KTI content in a subset of 38 cultivars. Low-KTI alleles were detected in both low- and high-KTI genotypes and vice versa, high-KTI alleles were found in both high- and low-KTI genotypes, indicating a tight but not perfect association of these markers with the KTI3 gene. The genetic marker SSR Satt228 showed a significant association with KTI content in the F2 progeny, while the SNP markers Gm08_45317135_T/G and Gm08_45541906_A/C allowed significant discrimination between progeny with high- vs. low-KTI progenies in the F3:5 generation. These three markers could be applied in MAS for low-KTI content but not without the additional phenotyping step to extract the desired low-KTI genotypes.",

Here, we aimed to assess the efficacy of priming and cross-priming in mitigating the stress caused by waterlogging and/or dehydration in soybeans (Glycine max ). Soybean plants were cultivated in a greenhouse in plastic pots in which soil moisture was maintained at pot capacity through irrigation. The first stress was applied in plants at the vegetative stage for 5days and involved either dehydration or waterlogging, depending on the treatment. Subsequently, the plants were irrigated or drained and maintained at pot capacity until the second stress. For the second stress, the conditions were repeated in plants at the reproductive stage. We then evaluated the levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ), lipid peroxidation, total soluble sugars (TSS), amino acids, proline, and starch, and the activity of antioxidant, fermentative, and aminotransferase enzymes. Under waterlogging and dehydration, priming and cross-priming significantly increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes and the levels of TSS, amino acids, and proline while reducing H2 O2 concentration and lipid peroxidation. Under waterlogging, priming suppressed fermentative activity and increased carbohydrate content. This demonstrates that soybean plants activate their defence systems more promptly when subjected to priming.",

Giza 111 under drought conditions. The findings showed that leaves number, nodules number, branches number, relative water content (RWC), chlorophyll content, and maximum quantum efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) were significantly reduced in soybean under drought stress. In addition, anatomical structure of stems and leaves were negatively affected in stressed plants. Moreover, proline, electrolyte leakage (EL%) lipid peroxidation (MDA), superoxide (O2 ·-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and antioxidant enzymes, such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and peroxidase (POD), were significantly increased under drought stress. However, application of melatonin or Bacillus caused an improvement in growth characters, such as branches number, and increased chlorophyll a and b content, RWC as well as Fv/Fm in drought stressed soybean plants. Furthermore, melatonin and Bacillus treatments showed a significant decrease in EL%, MDA, O2 ·- and H2O2, besides regulating the activity of antioxidant enzymes under drought stress. The stems and leaves anatomical structure, such as lamina thickness, lower and upper epidermis thickness, number of xylem vessels/bundle, stem diameter, xylem vessels diameter, and phloem thickness, were improved under drought conditions with melatonin and Bacillus treatments. Therefore, the outcomes of this investigation recommended the use of melatonin as foliar spray and Bacillus thuringiensis as seed treatment, which could regulate a number of stress-responsive mechanisms to protect the stressed soybean plants, improve their growth under drought stress."

      "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd)-contamination impairs biological nitrogen fixation in legumes (BNF), threatening global food security. Innovative strategies to enhance BNF and improve plant resistance to Cd are therefore crucial. This study investigates the effects of graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (g-C3N4 NSs) on soybean (Glycine max L.) in Cd contaminated soil, focusing on Cd distribution, chemical forms and nitrogen (N) fixation. Soybean plants were treated with 100 mg kg-1 g-C3N4 NSs, with or without 10 mg kg-1 Cd for 4 weeks. Soil addition of g-C3N4 NSs alleviated Cd toxicity and promote soybean growth via scavenging Cd-mediated oxidative stress and improving photosynthesis. Compared to Cd treatment, g-C3N4 NSs increased shoot and root dry weights under Cd toxicity by 49.5% and 63.4%, respectively. g-C3N4 NSs lowered Cd content by 35.7%-54.1%, redistributed Cd subcellularly by increasing its proportion in the cell wall and decreasing it in soluble fractions and organelles, and converted Cd from high-toxicity to low-toxicity forms. Additionally, g-C3N4 NSs improved the soil N cycle, stimulated nodulation, and increased the N-fixing capacity of nodules, thus increasing N content in shoots and roots by 12.4% and 43.2%, respectively. Mechanistic analysis revealed that g-C3N4 NSs mitigated Cd-induced loss of endogenous nitric oxide in nodules, restoring nodule development. This study highlights the potential of g-C3N4 NSs for remediating Cd-contaminated soil, reducing Cd accumulation, and enhancing plant growth and N fixation, offering new insights into the use of carbon nanomaterials for soil improvement and legume productivity under metal(loid)s stress.",

The results demonstrated that after nine days of fermentation, the Gly + Pp group exhibited significantly (P < 0.05) lower moisture content (19.04%), water activity (0.686), and pH (4.78) values, alongside notably (P < 0.05) higher lactic acid bacteria count (8.11 log CFU/g sausage) and redness value (17.2), compared to the other three groups (P < 0.05). In addition, the dry sausages in the Gly + Pp group exhibited the lowest peroxide value (0.34 meq/kg sausage), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (0.46 MAD/kg sausage), and protein carbonyl content (1.26 nmol/kg protein) during fermentation, followed by the Gly group, Pp group, and control group. Electronic tongue (e-tongue) and sensory evaluations revealed that the combined treatment with P. pentosaceus R1 and Gly resulted in superior taste characteristics. Besides, partial least squares regression (PLSR) analysis illustrated that the taste qualities characterized using the e-tongue were accordant with the sensory evaluation consequences, and total free amino acids (FAAs) and organic acids contributed to the dry sausages' taste properties. In conclusion, the combined application of Gly and P. pentosaceus R1 enhanced the physicochemical properties, oxidative stability, and taste profile of Harbin dry sausages.",

This study was carried out at Lovely Professional University's agricultural research farm in Punjab, India, during the year 2023. The experimental design followed a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. The experiment aimed to assess the effect of three chemical mutagens, sodium azide (SA), ethyl methyl sulphonates (EMSs), and methyl methane sulfonate (MMS), at three different concentrations (0.2%, 0.4%, and 0.6%), in SL958 and SL744 soybean varieties to select the mutant exhibiting the highest yield. The data were collected and analysed using a two-way ANOVA test through SPSS software (version 22), and the means were separated using Duncan's multiple range test (DMRT) at the 5% level of significance. Between the two varieties, the highest seed germination percentage (76.0% seedlings/plot) was recorded in SL958 (0.4% SA), while the lowest (30.33% seedlings/plot) was observed in 0.6% MMS as compared to the control (53% and 76% in SL744 and SL958 at 10 days after sowing, respectively). Several weeks after sowing, the average plant height was observed to be higher (37.84 ± 1.32 cm) in SL958 (0.4% SA) and lower (20.58 ± 0.30 cm) in SL744 (0.6% SA), as compared to the controls (SL958: 26.09 ± 0.62 cm and SL744: 27.48 ± 0.74 cm). The average leaf count was the highest (234.33 ± 3.09 tetrafoliate leaves/plant) in SL958 (0.4% SA) while it was the lowest (87 leaves/plant) in 0.6% MMS as compared to the control (SL744 180.00 ± 1.63 and SL958 160.73 ± 1.05). The highest total leaf areas recorded in the SL958 and SL744 M1plants were 3625.8 ± 1.43 cm2 and 2311.03 ± 3.65 cm2, respectively. Seeds of the SL958 variety treated with 0.4% SA resulted in the development of tetrafoliate leaves with a broad leaf base and the maximum yield (277.55 ± 1.37 pods/plant) compared to the narrow pentafoliate leaves obtained through the treatment with EMS. Meanwhile, in the SL744 variety, the same treatment led to tetrafoliate leaves with a comparatively lower yield of 206.54 ± 23.47 pods/plant as compared to the control (SL744 164.33 ± 8.58 and SL958 229.86 ± 0.96). The highest protein content (47.04 ± 0.87% TSP) was recorded in the SL958 (0.4% SA) M2 seeds followed by a content of 46.14 ± 0.64% TSP in the SL744 (0.4% SA) M2 seeds, whereas the lowest content (38.13 ± 0.81% TSP) was found in SL958 (0.6% MMS). Similar observations were recorded for the lipid and fibre content. The 0.4% SA treatment in SL958 proved to be efficient in generating the highest leaf area (tetrafoliate leaves) and a reasonable yield of M1 (the first generation after mutation) plants."

Dimethyloxallyl glycine (DMOG) enhanced mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) capabilities, but it remains unclear how DMOG-pretreatment of MSCs augments their SLE treatment. Here, we explore the therapeutic potential of DMOG-pretreated human umbilical cord MSCs (hUC-MSCs) in a mouse lupus nephritis (LN) model. In vitro experiments showed that DMOG could alleviate the mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ, and interleukin (IL)-6 and increase the mRNA level of IL-13 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in hUC-MSCs. DMOG enhanced the migratory and invasive abilities of the hUC-MSCs. In vivo animal studies revealed that DMOG-pretreated hUC-MSCs exhibited more pronounced inhibition of lymphadenectasis and reduced kidney weight and urinary protein content than MSCs alone. DMOG-pretreated hUC-MSCs improved renal morphological structure and alleviated inflammatory cell infiltration and renal fibrosis, evidenced by the reduced mRNA levels of fibrosis markers, including fibronectin (Fn), collagen alpha-1 chain (Colα1), collagen alpha-3 chain (Colα3), and TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-6 cytokines. Further investigation revealed that DMOG-pretreated hUC-MSCs down-regulated the expressions of transforming growth factor (Tgf)-β1 and its downstream effectors Smad2 and Smad3, recognized as central mediators in renal fibrosis (P < 0.05). The findings suggest that DMOG-pretreated hUC-MSCs can augment the therapeutic efficacy of hUC-MSCs in LN by enhancing their anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects, and the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway may be involved in this process."

Patients with mutations in the human GlyT2 gene (SLC6A5), develop hyperekplexia or startle disease (OMIM 149400), characterized by hypertonia and exaggerated startle responses to trivial stimuli that may have lethal consequences in the neonates as a result of apnea episodes. Post-translational modifications in cysteine residues of GlyT2 are an aspect of structural interest we analyzed. Our study is compatible with a reversible and short-lived S-acylation in spinal cord membranes, detectable by biochemical and proteomics methods (acyl-Rac binding and IP-ABE) confirmed with positive and negative controls (palmitoylated and non-palmitoylated proteins). According to a short-lived modification, direct labeling using click chemistry was faint but mostly consistent. We have analyzed the physiological properties of a GlyT2 mutant lacking the cysteines with high prediction of palmitoylation and the mutant is less prone to be included in lipid rafts, an effect also observed upon treatment with the palmitoylation inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate. This work demonstrates there are determinants of lipid raft inclusion associated with the GlyT2 mutated cysteines, which are presumably modified by palmitoylation.",

There were 180 crossbred weaning pigs with an average body weight (BW) of 7.94 ± 1.53 kg (five pigs per pen [two barrows and three gilts]; nine pens per treatment) that were randomly assigned to one of four diets. We used a basal diet as the control, TRT1 as the treatment with 0.10% precursor of GSH, TRT2 as the treatment with 0.20% precursor of GSH and TRT3 as the treatment with 0.30% precursor of GSH. The BW of weaning pigs exhibited a linear increase on days 7 (p < 0.001), 21 (p < 0.001) and 42 (p < 0.009) following the supplementation with the GSH precursor. Supplementation with GSH precursor led to a consistent and gradual increase in average daily gain (ADG) on days 8-21, 22-42 and overall, as indicated by a significant linear trend (p < 0.05). G: F was linearly increased (p < 0.05) on days 22-42 and overall with the increment in the precursor of GSH supplementation. However, GSH precursor supplementation did not have any impact on nutrient digestibility and blood profile in the treatment group. In summary, the administration of GSH precursor improved BW, ADG and G: F ratio while not affecting nutrient digestibility or blood profile.",

An endogenous peptide derived from the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, glycine-proline-glutamate (GPE), has IGF-I-sensitizing and neuroprotective actions. Here, we examined the effects of GPE on Aβ levels and hippocampal inflammation generated by the intracerebroventricular infusion of Aβ25-35 for 2 weeks (300 pmol/day) in ovariectomized rats and the signaling-related pathways and levels of Aβ-degrading enzymes associated with these GPE-related effects. GPE prevented the Aβ-induced increase in the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and the reduction in activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, insulin receptor substrate-1, and Akt, as well as on interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-13 levels in the hippocampus. The functionality of somatostatin, measured as the percentage of inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity and the levels of insulin-degrading enzyme, was also preserved by GPE co-treatment. These findings indicate that GPE co-administration may protect from Aβ insult by changing hippocampal cytokine content and somatostatin functionality through regulation of leptin- and IGF-I-signaling pathways that could influence the reduction in Aβ levels through modulation of levels and/or activity of Aβ proteases.",

This highlights the urgent need to delineate the intrinsic heterogeneity and biological roles of metabolic vulnerabilities to advance precision oncology. The metabolic heterogeneity of malignant cells was identified using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) profiles and validated through bulk transcriptomes. Serine-glycine-one-carbon (SGOC) metabolism was screened out to be responsible for the aggressive malignant properties and poor prognosis in HNSCC patients. A 4-SGOC gene prognostic signature, constructed by LASSO-COX regression analysis, demonstrated good predictive performance for overall survival and therapeutic responses. Patients in the low-risk group exhibited greater infiltration of exhausted CD8+ T cells, and demonstrated better clinical outcomes after receiving immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Conversely, high-risk patients exhibited characteristics of cold tumors, with enhanced IMPDH1-mediated purine biosynthesis, resulting in poor responses to current therapies. IMPDH1 emerged as a potential therapeutic metabolic target. Treatment with IMPDH inhibitors effectively suppressed HNSCC cell proliferation and metastasis and induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo by triggering GTP-exhaustion nucleolar stress. Our findings underscore the metabolic vulnerabilities of HNSCC in facilitating accurate patient stratification and individualized precise metabolic-targeted treatment.",

      "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) remains a leading cause of cancer-related incidence and mortality in men. Disruptions in amino acid (AA) metabolism contribute to the disease progression, with brucine, a glycine antagonist, exhibiting antitumor effects. This study explores the antitumor impact of brucine on PCa and investigates its mechanisms in regulating AA metabolic pathways. The study employed the PCa cell line DU-145, characterized by high sarcosine (Sar) levels, for various assays including Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8), wound healing, Transwell, 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EDU), TdT mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL), flow cytometry, Western blot, and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Network pharmacological analysis determined the anticancer mechanisms of brucine. Sar levels in DU-145 cells were significantly higher than in normal prostatic epithelial cells RWPE-1. Treatment with brucine resulted in a marked decrease in cell viability, proliferation, invasion, and migration, while promoting apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Sar levels decreased with increasing brucine concentration. Network pharmacology analysis linked brucine's anticancer effect to the AA metabolism and glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) pathways. GNMT expression in prostate cancer tissues and The Cancer Genome Atlas database was significantly elevated compared to controls. Treatment with brucine led to downregulation of GNMT expression in DU-145 cells without significant effect on sarcosine dehydrogenase (SARDH). Addition of recombinant GNMT partially reversed the inhibitory effects of brucine on DU-145 cells. Treatment with brucine downregulates GNMT expression in DU-145 cells, reducing Sar accumulation and inhibiting tumor progression. These findings provide new insights into the antitumor mechanisms of brucine in PCa.",

METHODS: The correlation between the expression level of CSRP2 mRNA and the prognosis of NB children in NB clinical samples was analyzed in R2 Genomics Analysis and Visualization Platform. The small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting CSRP2 or CSRP2 plasmid were transfected to NB cell lines SK-N-BE(2) and SH-SY5Y. Cell proliferation was observed by crystal violet staining and real-time cellular analysis. The ability of colony formation of NB cells was observed by colony-forming unit assay. Immunofluorescence assay was used to detect the expression of the proliferation marker Ki-67. Flow cytometry analysis for cell cycle proportion was used with cells stained by propidium iodide (PI). Annexin V/7AAD was used to stain cells and analyze the percentage of cell apoptosis. The ability of cell migration was determined by cell wound-healing assay. The level of protein and mRNA expression of CSRP2 in NB primary tumor and NB cell lines were detected by Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). RESULTS: By analyzing the NB clinical sample databases, it was found that the expression levels of CSRP2 in high-risk NB with 3/4 stages in international neuroblastoma staging system (INSS) were significantly higher than that in low-risk NB with 1/2 INSS stages. The NB patients with high expression levels of CSRP2 were shown lower overall survival rate than those with low expression levels of CSRP2. We detected the protein levels of CSRP2 in the NB samples by Western blot, and found that the protein level of CSRP2 in 3/4 INSS stages was significantly higher than that in 1/2 INSS stages. Knockdown of CSRP2 inhibited cell viability and proliferation of NB cells. Overexpression of CSRP2 increased the proliferation of NB cells. Flow cytometry showed that the proportion of sub-G1, G0/G1 and S phase cells and Annexin V positive cells were increased after CSRP2 deficiency. In the cell wound-healing assay, the healing rate of NB cells was significantly attenuated after knockdown of CSRP2. Further mechanism studies showed that the proportion of the proliferation marker Ki-67 and the phosphorylation levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) were significantly decreased after CSRP2 knockdown. CONCLUSION: CSRP2 is highly expressed in high-risk NB with 3/4 INSS stages, and the expression levels of CSRP2 are negatively correlated with the overall survival of NB patients. CSRP2 significantly increased the proliferation and cell migration of NB cells and inhibited cell apoptosis via the activation of ERK1/2. All these results indicate that CSRP2 promotes the progression of NB by activating ERK1/2, and this study will provide a potential target for high-risk NB therapy.",

      "abstract": "Soybean, a major legume crop, has seen a decline in its production owing to challenges in seed germination and the development of seedlings. Thus, in this study, we systematically investigated the influence of various chitosan-S-nitrosoglutathione (chitosan-GSNO) nanoparticle (0, 25, 50, and 100 µM) and Si (0, 0.5, and 1 mM) priming concentrations on soybean seed germination and seedling growth over five different priming durations (range: 1-5 h at each concentration). Significant differences were observed in all parameters, except seedling diameter, with both treatments. Seed germination was significantly enhanced after 3 h of priming in both treatments. The final germination percentage (FGP), peak germination percentage (PGP), vigor index (VI), seedling biomass (SB), hypocotyl length (HL), and radical length (RL) of 100 μM chitosan-GSNO-nanoparticle-primed seeds increased by 20.3%, 41.3%, 78.9%, 25.2%, 15.7%, and 65.9%, respectively, compared with those of the control; however, the mean germination time (MGT) decreased by 18.43%. Si priming at 0.5 mM increased the FGP, PGP, VI, SB, HL, and RL by 13.9%, 55.17%, 39.2%, 6.5%, 22.5%, and 25.1%, respectively, but reduced the MGT by 12.29% compared with the control treatment. Chitosan-GSNO and Si treatment up-regulated the relative expression of gibberellic acid (GA)-related genes (GmGA3ox3 and GmGA2ox1) and down-regulated that of abscisic acid (ABA)-related genes (GmABA2, GmAAO3, and GmNCED5). Chitosan-GSNO and Si application increased bioactive GA4 levels and simultaneously reduced ABA content. Hence, the use of exogenous chitosan-GSNO nanoparticles and Si as priming agents had a beneficial effect on seed germination and seedling growth because of the up-regulation in the expression of GA and down-regulation in the expression of ABA. Additional research is needed to understand the combined impact of Si and chitosan-GSNO nanoparticles, including their effects on the expression levels of other hormones and genes even in the later growth stage of the crop."

      "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common primary liver cancer, typically arises from chronic liver conditions such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, or other chronic liver diseases, and is characterized by its aggressive nature and poor prognosis. The purpose of this research was to clarify the function of achaete-scute family bHLH transcription factor 1 (ASCL1) and solute carrier family 6 member 13 (SLC6A13) in influencing tumor cell behavior, inflammatory responses, and the regulation of inflammasomes. We analyzed the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the Cancer Genome Atlas-Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA-LIHC) database, as well as in the GSE14520 and GSE67764 datasets, to identify the expression changes of SLC6A13 in liver cancer. The prognostic significance of SLC6A13 in LIHC was assessed through Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis. Transcriptional regulation of SLC6A13 by ASCL1 was explored using the Joint Annotation of the Human Genome and other species by the Systematic Pipeline for the Annotation of Regulatory Regions (JASPAR) database and dual-luciferase assays. In vitro experiments investigated the impact of ASCL1 and SLC6A13 overexpression on HCC cell growth. Additionally, the effects of ethanol treatment and glycine modulation on the inflammatory response in HCC cell lines were evaluated. HCC samples showed reduced levels of SLC6A13, which correlates with a better prognosis for liver metastases. Elevated SLC6A13 expression correlated with improved overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and disease-specific survival (DSS). ASCL1 upregulated SLC6A13 and inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells. Ethanol induced the production of inflammatory cytokines, which was enhanced by overexpression of SLC6A13 but counteracted by glycine. This study highlighted elevated expression of SLC6A13 in LIHC which has been correlated with improved OS, PFS, RFS, and DSS. Overexpression of SLC6A13 and ASCL1 in HCC cells enhanced inflammasome activation, which was exacerbated by ethanol and attenuated by glycine.",

      "abstract": "Cysteine and glycine-rich protein 2 (CSRP2) is expressed differently in numerous cancers and plays a key role in carcinogenesis. However, the role of CSRP2 in glioma is unknown. This study sought to determine the expression profile and clinical significance of CSRP2 in glioma and explore its biological functions and mechanisms via lentivirus-mediated CSRP2 silencing experiments. Increased CSRP2 was frequently observed in gliomas, which was associated with clinicopathological characteristics and an unfavourable prognosis. Decreasing CSRP2 led to the suppression of malignant proliferation, metastasis and stemness in glioma cells while causing hypersensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. Mechanistic investigations revealed that CSRP2 plays a role in mediating the Notch signalling cascade. Silencing CSRP2 decreased the levels of Notch1, cleaved Notch1, HES1 and HEY1, suppressing the Notch signalling cascade. Reactivation of Notch markedly diminished the tumour-inhibiting effects of CSRP2 silencing on the malignant phenotypes of glioma cells. Notably, CSRP2-silencing glioma cells exhibited reduced potential in the formation of xenografts in nude mice in vivo, which was associated with an impaired Notch signalling cascade. These results showed that CSRP2 is overexpressed in glioma and has a crucial role in sustaining the malignant phenotypes of glioma, suggesting that targeting CSRP2 could be a promising strategy for glioma treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cadmium (Cd) is extremely toxic and non-essential for plants. Different soybean varieties differ greatly in their Cd accumulation ability, but little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. RESULTS: Here, we performed transcriptomic analysis using Illumina pair-end sequencing on root tissues from two soybean varieties (su8, high-Cd-accumulating (HAS) and su7, low Cd-accumulating (LAS)) grown with 0 or 50 μM CdSO4. A total of 18.76 million clean reads from the soybean root samples were obtained after quality assessment and data filtering. After Cd treatment, 739 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; 265 up and 474 down) were found in HAS; however, only 259 DEGs (88 up and 171 down) were found in LAS, and 64 genes were same between the two varieties. Pathway enrichment analysis suggested that after cadmium treatment, the DEGs between LAS and HAS were mainly enriched in glutathione metabolism and plant-pathogen interaction pathways. KEGG analysis showed that phenylalanine metabolism responding to cadmium stress in LAS, while ABC transporters responding to cadmium stress in HAS. Besides we found more differential expressed heavy metal transporters such as ABC transporters and zinc transporters in HAS than LAS, and there were more transcription factors differently expressed in HAS than LAS after cadmium treatment in two soybean varieties, eg. bHLH transcription factor, WRKY transcription factor and ZIP transcription factor. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study will shed new insights on the underlying molecular mechanisms behind the Cd accumulation in soybean.",

      "abstract": "In this study, 20-day-old soybean plants were watered with 100 mL of 100 mM NaCl solution and sprayed with silica nanoparticles (SiO2 NPs) or potassium silicate every 3 days over 15 days, with a final dosage of 12 mg of SiO2 per plant. We assessed the alterations in the plant's growth and physiological traits, and the responses of bacterial microbiome within the leaf endosphere, rhizosphere, and root endosphere. The result showed that the type of silicon did not significantly impact most of the plant parameters. However, the bacterial communities within the leaf and root endospheres had a stronger response to SiO2 NPs treatment, showing enrichment of 24 and 13 microbial taxa, respectively, compared with the silicate treatment, which led to the enrichment of 9 and 8 taxonomic taxa, respectively. The rhizosphere bacterial communities were less sensitive to SiO2 NPs, enriching only 2 microbial clades, compared to the 8 clades enriched by silicate treatment. Furthermore, SiO2 NPs treatment enriched beneficial genera, such as Pseudomonas, Bacillus, and Variovorax in the leaf and root endosphere, likely enhancing plant growth and salinity stress resistance. These findings highlight the potential of SiO2 NPs for foliar application in sustainable farming by enhancing plant-microbe interactions to improve salinity tolerance.",

      "abstract": "High-mannose-type glycan structure of N-glycoproteins plays important roles in the proper folding of proteins in sorting glycoprotein secretion and degradation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 (G1M9)-type N-glycan is one of the most important signaling molecules in the ER. However, current chemical synthesis strategies are laborious, warranting more practical approaches for G1M9-glycopeptide development. Wang et al. reported the procedure to give G1M9-Asn-Fmoc through chemical modifications and purifications from 40 chicken eggs, but only 3.3 mg of G1M9-glycopeptide was obtained. Therefore, better methods are needed to obtain more than 10 mg of G1M9-glycopeptide. In this study, we report the preparation of G1M9-glycopeptide (13.2 mg) linking Asn-Gly-Thr triad as consensus sequence from 40 chicken eggs. In this procedure, λ-carrageenan treatment followed by papain treatment was used to separate the Fc region of IgY antibody that harbors high-mannose glycans. Moreover, cotton hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography was adapted for easy purification. The resulting G1M9-Asn(Fmoc)-Gly-Thr was identified by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy. G1M9-Asn(Fmoc)-Gly, G1M9-Asn(Fmoc), and G1M9-OH were also detected by mass spectroscopy. Here, our developed G1M9-tripeptide might be useful for the elucidation of glycoprotein functions as well as the specific roles of the consensus sequence.",

Here, we detail the case of a 66-year-old woman who underwent a renal transplantation 8 months prior, who was admitted with subacute onset of encephalomyelitis, accompanied by headaches, paraplegia, weakness, vomiting, and abdominal pain, with a positive COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab test 1 month before admission. MRI scans of the brain revealed multiple lesions in the white matter of the bilateral deep frontal lobe, the left temporal lobe and insula lobe. Additionally, there were multiple short segment lesions in the spinal cord and subdural hematoma at T1, T6-T7 posterior. The serum revealed a positive result for GlyR-IgG. Following the administration of corticosteroid and intravenous immunoglobulin, there was a significant improvement in the patient's symptoms within 2 weeks, and her brain MRI showed a reduction in the lesion. Despite its rarity, we believe this to be the inaugural documentation of anti-GlyR encephalomyelitis occurring during renal transplantation. A full panel of antibodies for autoimmune encephalomyelitis is the key leading to the diagnosis."

Nutrient enrichment is vital for improving the nutritional quality of soybeans. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of foliar application of amino acids (AA) and zinc (Zn) on agronomic traits and the accumulation of grain Zn in soybeans. The experimental design comprised 16 treatment combinations involving four levels of amino acid application (0, 50, 100, and 150 ml 100 L-1) and Zn (0, 2, 4, and 6 mg L-1) following a randomized complete block design with three replications in field conditions. The results demonstrated that the application of foliar Zn and AA did not affect the yield, whereas that of AA50*Zn2 and AA150*Zn2 affected the number of pods and branches. The effects of AA application on N and the protein content in grains were determined to be significant. The application of AA100*Zn6 emerged as the most effective treatment for the enhancement of Zn biofortification in soybean grains. The combined foliar application of AA and Zn contributed to enhanced Zn accumulation in the grains."

Here, we characterize a tonoplast localized multidrug and toxic compound extrusion transporter, GmMATE100 (encoded by Glyma.18G143700), from soybean (Glycine max L.). GmMATE100 is co-expressed with soyasaponin biosynthetic genes, and its expression was induced by MeJA treatment, which also led to soyasaponin accumulation in soybean roots. GmMATE100 efficiently transports multiple type-B soyasaponins as well as type-A soyasaponins with low affinity from the cytosol to the vacuole in a yeast system. The GmMATE100 loss-of-function mutant showed a significant decrease in type-A and type-B soyasaponin contents in soybean roots.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: β cell mass (BCM) and function are essential to the diagnosis and therapy of diabetes. Diabetic patients serve β cell loss is, and damage of β cells leads to severe insulin deficiency. Our understanding of the role of BCM in diabetes progression is extremely limited by lacking efficient methods to evaluate BCM in vivo. In vitro methods of labeling islets, including loading of contrast reagent or integration of exogenous biomarker, require artificial manipulation on islets, of which the clinical application is limited. Imaging methods targeting endogenous biomarkers may solve the above problems. However, traditional reagents targeting GLP-1R and VAMT2 result in a high background of adjacent tissues, complicating the identification of pancreatic signals. Here, we report a non-invasive and quantitative imaging technique by using radiolabeled glycine mimics ([18F]FBG, a boron-trifluoride derivative of glycine) to assay islet function and monitor BCM changes in living animals. METHODS: Glycine derivatives, FBG, FBSa, 2Me-FBG, 3Me-FBG, were successfully synthesized and labeled with 18F. Specificity of glycine derivatives were characterized by in vitro experiment. PET imaging and biodistribution studies were performed in animal models carring GLYT over-expressed cells. In vivo evaluation of BCM with [18F]FBG were performed in STZ (streptozocin) induced T1D (type 1 diabetes) models. RESULTS: GLYT responds to excess blood glycine levels and transports glycine into islet cells to maintain the activity of the glycine receptor (GLYR). Best PET imaging condition was 80 min after given a total of 240 ~ 250 nmol imaging reagent (a mixture of [18F]FBG and natural glycine) intravenously. [18F]FBG can detect both endogenous and exogenous islets clearly in vivo. When applied to STZ induced T1D mouse models, total uptake of [18F]FBG in the pancreas exhibited a linear correlation with survival BCM. CONCLUSION: [18F]FBG targeting the endogenous glycine transporter (GLYT), which is highly expressed on islet cells, avoiding extra modification on islet cells. Meanwhile the highly restricted expression pattern of GLYT excluded the background in adjacent tissues. This [18F]FBG-based imaging technique provides a non-invasive method to quantify BCM in vivo, implying a new evaluation index for diabetic assessment.",

      "abstract": "Soybean is a leguminous crop known for its multiple utilizations both as food and feed for humans and livestock. The objectives of the study were to identify high dry matter yielder and stable genotypes across environments in southwestern Ethiopia. The effect of genotype environment (G x E) interaction on dry matter yield of soybean genotypes were evaluated in two cropping seasons (2019-2020) under rain fed condition. Eight pre tested soybean genotypes with two checks were used as treatment in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Collected data were recorded and analyzed using GGE biplot models using R software. The combined analysis of variance showed that dry matter yield of soybean genotypes was significantly affected by genotype, environment and genotype-environment (G x E) interaction. The genotype, environment, and genotype-environment interaction, respectively, accounted for 11.4%, 49.5%, and 38.8% of the observed variation to the dry mater yield. This indicates that dry matter yield was significantly more affected by environments and G × E interaction than genotypes. The GGE biplot analysis revealed that six environments used in the current study were grouped into four mega-environments. The mega-environments were identified for genotype evaluation. The biplot showed that the vertex genotypes were G4, G10, and G9 and considered as optimum performance in their respective mega-environments and more responsive to environmental changes. The biplot also showed that ENV5 (Kersa 2020) was an ideal and the most discriminating and representative environment. Genotype G4 (TGX1990-114FN) was the ideal genotype and overall winner in dry matter yield and stability in the findings. Therefore, genotype G4 (TGX-1990-114FN) is the better option to be used as forage soybean in Ethiopia. Further demonstration of the feeding values of high yielders and stable genotypes on animal performances should be done."

Feeding low protein (LP) diets without the impairment of performance traits needs the optimized dietary levels of threonine (Thr) and the non-essential amino acid (AA) glycine (Gly) and serine (Ser). However, the required concentrations and interactions of Thr and Gly + Ser, expressed as Gly equivalent (Glyequi), in LP diets are not fully understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of three LP (LP1-3) grower (11-24 days) and finisher (25-35 days) diets with 2% CP reduction compared to the control (C), differing in standardized ileal digestible (SID) Thr to lysine (Lys) ratio (C, LP1, LP3: 63%, LP2: 72%) and Glyequi levels (C: 15.65 g/kg, LP1: 13.74 g/kg, LP2: 13.70 g/kg, LP3: 15.77). The LP treatments did not impair the performance traits of broilers. The LP2 treatment with increased SID Thr-to-Lys ratio (+9.0%) resulted in significantly higher body weight gain and a more advantageous feed conversion ratio in the whole fattening compared to the control treatment with normal CP level (p < 0.05). The LP3 treatment containing swine meat meal with similar Glyequi levels compared to the normal CP treatment led to the most advantageous feed conversion ratio in the finisher phase and the highest nitrogen retention efficiency (p < 0.05). However, the LP3 treatment with a high starch-to-CP ratio negatively influenced the relative carcass weight and the ratio of abdominal fat of broilers (p < 0.05)."

Understanding the mechanisms and utilization of exogenous substances underlying plant tolerance to cold stress would lay the foundation for improving temperature resilience in this important crop. Our study is aiming to investigate the effect of exogenous glycine betaine (GB) on tomato seedlings to increase tolerance to low temperatures. By treating tomato seedlings with exogenous GB under low temperature stress, we found that 30 mmol/L exogenous GB can significantly improve the cold tolerance of tomato seedlings. Exogenous GB can influence the enzyme activity of antioxidant defense system and ROS levels in tomato leaves. The seedlings with GB treatment presented higher Fv/Fm value and photochemical activity under cold stress compared with the control. Moreover, analysis of high-throughput plant phenotyping of tomato seedlings also supported that exogenous GB can protect the photosynthetic system of tomato seedlings under cold stress. In addition, we proved that exogenous GB significantly increased the content of endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) and decreased endogenous gibberellin (GA) levels, which protected tomatoes from low temperatures. Meanwhile, transcriptional analysis showed that GB regulated the expression of genes involved in antioxidant capacity, calcium signaling, photosynthesis activity, energy metabolism-related and low temperature pathway-related genes in tomato plants. In conclusion, our findings indicated that exogenous GB, as a cryoprotectant, can enhance plant tolerance to low temperature by improving the antioxidant system, photosynthetic system, hormone signaling, and cold response pathway and so on."

In this study, we evaluated the potential particle size-dependent effects of soil-applied copper oxide nanoparticles (nCuO) on crop yield and quality attributes (photosynthetic pigments, seed yield and nutrient quality, seed protein, and seed oil), including root and seed Cu bioaccumulation and a suite of oxidative stress biomarkers, in soybean (Glycine max L.) grown in field environment. We synthesized three distinct sized (25 nm = S [small], 50 nm = M [medium], and 250 nm = L [large]) nCuO with same surface charge and compared with soluble Cu2+ ions (CuCl2) and water-only controls. Results showed particle size-dependent effects of nCuO on the photosynthetic pigments (Chla and Chlb), seed yield, potassium and phosphorus accumulation in seed, and protein and oil yields, with nCuO-S showing higher inhibitory effects. Further, increased root and seed Cu bioaccumulation led to concomitant increase in oxidative stress (H2O2, MDA), and as a response, several antioxidants (SOD, CAT, POX, and APX) increased proportionally, with nCuO treatments including Cu2+ ion treatment. These results are corroborated with TEM ultrastructure analysis showing altered seed oil bodies and protein storage vacuoles with nCuO-S treatment compared to control. Taken together, we propose particle size-dependent Cu bioaccumulation-mediated oxidative stress as a mechanism of nCuO toxicity. Future research investigating the potential fate of varied size nCuO, with a focus on speciation at the soil-root interface, within the root, and edible parts such as seed, will guide health risk assessment of nCuO.",

      "abstract": "Poor eggshell quality of eggs laid by aged laying hens is the major problem affecting the length of the rearing period in the laying hen industry. Trace elements are required and play vital roles in the eggshell quality of laying hens. Appropriate dose of organic microelements is environmentally friendly and sufficient to satisfy the needs of hens because of their greater bioavailability and lower excretion than inorganic forms. The aim of this experiment was to investigate the effects of manganese (Mn) glycine (MG) on eggshell quality, elemental deposition, and eggshell ultrastructure in aged laying hens. A total of 720 Hy-Line Brown hens 70 weeks old were assigned equally to four groups with six replicates of 30 birds each. The hens were fed basal diets (without Mn supplementation) supplemented with 120 mg/kg of Mn from manganese sulfate monohydrate (MSM), or 40, 80, or 120 mg/kg Mn from MG for 12 weeks. Dietary supplementation with 80 mg/kg Mn from MG resulted in the greatest eggshell strength after 6 weeks of treatment (P = 0.047), and in greater eggshell strength than observed in the MSM control after 12 weeks of treatment (P = 0.025). After 12 weeks of treatment, the eggs of hens in the MG groups showed lower mammillary layer thickness in the blunt end, equator, and acute end than observed in the MSM control group (P < 0.001). With the exception of the blunt ends of eggs from hens in the 120 mg/kg MG group, the eggs of hens in the MG groups, compared with the MSM control group, exhibited a lower mammillary layer ratio, and greater palisade layer ratio and effective layer ratio in the blunt end, equator, and acute end (P < 0.001). Dietary supplementation with 80 mg/kg Mn from MG, compared with the MSM control and 40 and 120 mg/kg MG, resulted in the greatest palisade layer thickness and effective layer thickness, and the lowest mammillary layer thickness in the equator (P < 0.001, P = 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, supplementation with 80 mg/kg Mn from MG exhibited the greatest ratio of the palisade layer and effective layer, and the lowest mammillary layer ratio in the blunt end and equator (all P < 0.001). The Mn content of eggshells in hens-fed diets supplemented with 80 and 120 mg/kg Mn from MG was greater than that in the MSM control and 40 mg/kg MG groups (P = 0.035). Dietary supplementation with 80 or 120 mg/kg Mn from MG resulted in greater tibia Mn content than observed in the 40 mg/kg MG group (P = 0.019), and greater yolk Mn content than observed in the 40 mg/kg MG and MSM control groups (P = 0.018). In conclusion, dietary supplementation with 80 mg/kg Mn from MG, compared with the MSM control (120 mg/kg Mn), may increase the deposition efficiency of Mn, alter eggshell elemental composition, improve eggshell ultrastructure, and enhance eggshell strength in aged laying hens.",

      "abstract": "High salinity inhibits microbial activity in the bioremediation of saline wastewater. To alleviate osmotic stress, glycine betaine (GB), an osmoprotectant, is added to enhance the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). These EPS are pivotal in withstanding environmental stressors, yet the intricate interplay between GB supplementation and microbial responses through EPS modifications-encompassing composition, molecular architecture, and electrochemical features-remains elusive in hypersaline conditions. Here we show microbial strategies for salinity endurance by investigating the impact of GB on the dynamic alterations of EPS properties. Our findings reveal that GB supplementation at 3.5% salinity elevates the total EPS (T-EPS) content from 12.50 ± 0.05 to 24.58 ± 0.96 mg per g dry cell weight. The observed shift in zeta potential from -28.95 to -6.25 mV at 0% and 3.5% salinity, respectively, with GB treatment, indicates a reduction in electrostatic repulsion and compaction. Notably, the EPS protein secondary structure transition from β-sheet to α-helix, with GB addition, signifies a more compact protein configuration, less susceptible to salinity fluctuations. Electrochemical analyses, including cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), reveal GB's role in promoting the release of exogenous electron shuttles, such as flavins and c-type cytochromes (c-Cyts). The enhancement in DPV peak areas (QDPV) with GB addition implies an increase in available extracellular electron transfer sites. This investigation advances our comprehension of microbial adaptation mechanisms to salinity through EPS modifications facilitated by GB in saline habitats."

      "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease with a poor prognosis. The current risk stratification system is essential but remains insufficient to select the best schedules. Cysteine-rich protein 1 (CSRP1) is a member of the CSRP family and associated with poor clinicopathological features in many tumors. This study aimed to explore the clinical significance and molecular mechanisms of cysteine- and glycine-rich protein 1 (CSRP1) in AML. RT-qPCR was used to detect the relative expression of CSRP1 in our clinical cohort. Functional enrichment analysis of CSRP1-related differentially expressed genes was carried out by GO/KEGG enrichment analysis, immune cell infiltration analysis, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The OncoPredict algorithm was implemented to explore correlations between CSRP1 and drug resistance. CSRP1 was highly expressed in AML compared with normal samples. High CSRP1 expression was an independent poor prognostic factor. Functional enrichment analysis showed neutrophil activation and apoptosis were associated with CSRP1. In the PPI network, 19 genes were present in the most significant module, and 9 of them were correlated with AML prognosis. The high CSRP1 patients showed higher sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil, gemcitabine, rapamycin, cisplatin and lower sensitivity to fludarabine. CSRP1 may serve as a potential prognostic marker and a therapeutic target for AML in the future.",

      "abstract": "Exogenous abiotic stimulant treatments are a straightforward and effective method for enhancing secondary metabolites in plants. In this study, the response surface optimization method was used to optimize the conditions for enriching flavonoids in short-germinated black soybeans under a slight acid treatment, and the mechanism of flavonoid accumulation during black soybean germination was explored. The results show that the use of a 126.2 mM citric acid-sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.10) as a slight acid treatment resulted in the highest flavonoid content when the black soybeans were germinated for 24 h. Under these conditions, the isoflavonoid (glycitin, daidzein, and genistein) increased significantly, and the flavonoid content reached 2.32 mg/g FW. The microacidified germination treatment significantly increased the activities and relative gene expression levels of key enzymes involved in flavonoid metabolism (4-coumarate-CoA ligase and cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase, etc.). However, the slight acid treatment inhibited the growth of the black soybeans and caused damage to their cells. This was evidenced by significantly higher levels of malondialdehyde, superoxide anion, and hydrogen peroxide compared to the control group. Furthermore, the antioxidant system in the short-germinated soybeans was activated by the slight acid treatment, leading to a significant increase in the activities and relative gene expression levels of catalase and peroxidase. The results above show that a slight acid treatment was beneficial in inducing the accumulation of flavonoids during the growth of black soybean sprouts. This lays a technical foundation for producing black soybean products that are rich in flavonoids."

      "abstract": "L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) is the main treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD) but with long term administration, motor complications such as dyskinesia are induced. Glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) inhibition was shown to produce an anti-dyskinetic effect in parkinsonian rats and primates, coupled with an improvement in the anti-parkinsonian action of L-DOPA. The expression of GlyT1 in the brain in the dyskinetic state remains to be investigated. Here, we quantified the levels of GlyT1 across different brain regions using [3H]-NFPS in the presence of Org-25,935. Brain sections were chosen from sham-lesioned rats, L-DOPA-naïve 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats and 6-OHDA-lesioned rats exhibiting mild or severe abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs). [3H]-NFPS binding decreased in the ipsilateral and contralateral thalamus, by 28% and 41%, in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats with severe AIMs compared to sham-lesioned animals (P < 0.01 and 0.001). [3H]-NFPS binding increased by 21% in the ipsilateral substantia nigra of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats with severe AIMs compared to 6-OHDA-lesioned rats with mild AIMs (P < 0.05). [3H]-NFPS binding was lower by 19% in the contralateral primary motor cortex and by 20% in the contralateral subthalamic nucleus of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats with mild AIMs animals compared to rats with severe AIMs (both P < 0.05). The severity of AIMs scores positively correlated with [3H]-NFPS binding in the ipsilateral substantia nigra (P < 0.05), ipsilateral entopeduncular nucleus (P < 0.05) and contralateral primary motor cortex (P < 0.05). These data provide an anatomical basis to explain the efficacy of GlyT1 inhibitors in dyskinesia in PD.",
