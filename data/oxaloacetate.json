      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The energy metabolite oxaloacetate is significantly lower in the blood plasma of ME/CFS subjects. A previous open-label trial with oxaloacetate supplementation demonstrated a significant reduction in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)-related fatigue. METHODS: In this follow-up trial, 82 ME/CFS subjects were enrolled in a 3-month randomized, double-blinded, controlled study, receiving either 2,000 mg of oxaloacetate or control per day. The primary endpoints were safety and reduction in fatigue from baseline. Secondary and exploratory endpoints included functional capacity and general health status. RESULTS: Anhydrous enol-oxaloacetate (oxaloacetate) was well tolerated at the tested doses. Oxaloacetate significantly reduced fatigue by more than 25% from baseline, while the control group showed a non-significant reduction of approximately 10%. Intergroup analysis showed a significant decrease in fatigue levels in the oxaloacetate group (p = 0.0039) with no notable change in the control group. A greater proportion of subjects in the oxaloacetate group achieved a reduction in fatigue greater than 25% compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Additionally, 40.5% of the oxaloacetate group were classified as \"enhanced responders,\" with an average fatigue reduction of 63%. Both physical and mental fatigue improved with oxaloacetate supplementation. CONCLUSION: Oxaloacetate is well tolerated and effectively helps reduce fatigue in ME/CFS patients.

      "abstract": "The blood enzyme glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) has been postulated as an effective therapeutic to protect the brain during stroke. To demonstrate its potential clinical utility, a new human recombinant form of GOT (rGOT) was produced for medical use. We tested the pharmacokinetics and evaluated the protective efficacy of rGOT in rodent and non-human primate models that reflected clinical stroke conditions. We found that continuous intravenous administration of rGOT within the first 8 h after ischemic onset significantly reduced the infarct size in both severe (30%) and mild lesions (48%). Cerebrospinal fluid and proteomics analysis, in combination with positron emission tomography imaging, indicated that rGOT can reach the brain and induce cytoprotective autophagy and induce local protection by alleviating neuronal apoptosis. Our results suggest that rGOT can be safely used immediately in patients suspected of having a stroke. This study requires further validation in clinical stroke populations."

      "abstract": "India experiences a significant amount of morbidity and mortality due to gliomas particularly glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which ranks among the worst cancers. Oxaloacetate (OAA) is a human keto acid that is central to cellular metabolism; it has been recognized by the US FDA for use in GBM patients, triggering a review to revisit the cellular mechanism of its therapeutic action. Various cellular and molecular studies have proposed that instead of fueling the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), gliomas prefer to use glycolysis (the Warburg effect) to fuel macromolecules for the synthesis of nucleotides, fatty acids, and amino acids for the accelerated mitosis. A study found that oxaloacetate (OAA) inhibits human lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) in cancer cells, reversing the Warburg effect. Studies revealed that OAA supplementation reduced Warburg glycolysis, improved neuronal cell bioenergetics, and triggered brain mitochondrial biogenesis, thereby enhancing the efficacy of standard treatment. Similarly, OAA has been found in preclinical investigations to be able to decrease tumor development and survival rates by blocking the conversion of glutamine to alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) in the TCA cycle and lowering nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) levels. OAA is a safe adjuvant that has the potential to be an effective therapy in gliomas when combined with temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy and routine surgery."

Adipose tissue (FAT)-derived stem or stromal cells are a convenient autologous choice for many regenerative cell therapy approaches. The intervertebral disc (IVD) is a suitable target. Comprised of an inner nucleus pulposus (NP) and an outer annulus fibrosus (AF), the degeneration of the IVD through trauma or aging presents a substantial socio-economic burden worldwide. The avascular nature of the mature NP forces cells to reside in a unique environment with increased lactate levels, conditions that pose a challenge to cell-based therapies. We assessed adipose and IVD tissue-derived stromal cells through in vitro transcriptome analysis in 2D and 3D culture and suggested that the transcription factor Glis1 and metabolite oxaloacetic acid (OAA) could provide NP cells with survival tools for the harsh niche conditions in the IVD."

      "abstract": "Acute lung injury (ALI) is the primary cause of death among patients with acute paraquat (PQ) poisoning, whereby peroxidative damage is an important mechanism underlying PQ-induced lung injury. There is a lack of effective interventional drugs for patients with PQ poisoning. Oxaloacetic acid (OAA) participates in multiple in vivo metabolic processes, whereby it facilitates the clearance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and improves mitochondrial function. The study aimed to assess the protective effects of OAA on PQ-induced ALI and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism. Our data demonstrated that OAA treatment significantly alleviated PQ-induced ALI and improved the survival rate of PQ-poisoned mice, and also alleviated PQ-induced cellular oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. OAA-mediated alleviation of PQ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction depends on the following mechanisms which may explain the above findings: 1) OAA effectively cleared intracellular ROS, inhibited ROS accumulation, and mitochondrial depolarization; 2) OAA inhibited the downregulation of L-OPA1 and MFN2 caused by PQ and promoted a dynamic balance of mitochondrial fusion and fission, and 3) the expression of PGC-1α, TFAM, COX2, and COX4I1, increased significantly following OAA intervention which improved mitochondrial respiratory functions and promoted its biogenesis and energy metabolism in damaged cells. In conclusion, OAA effectively cleared ROS and improved mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby significantly improving ALI caused by PQ poisoning and the animal survival rate. Therefore, OAA may be a potential drug for the treatment of PQ poisoning."

      "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of glutamate scavenger oxaloacetate (OA) combined with CGS21680, an adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) agonist, on acute traumatic brain injury (TBI), and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. C57BL/6J mice were subjected to moderate-level TBI by controlled cortical impact, and then were treated with OA, CGS21680, or OA combined with CGS21680 at acute stage of TBI. At 24 h post TBI, neurological severity score, brain water content, glutamate concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), mRNA and protein levels of IL-1β and TNF-α, mRNA level and activity of glutamate oxaloacetate aminotransferase (GOT), and ATP level of brain tissue were detected. The results showed that neurological deficit, brain water content, glutamate concentration in CSF, and the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β and TNF-α production were exacerbated in CGS21680 treated mice. Administrating OA suppressed the rise of both glutamate concentration in CSF and brain water content, and elevated the ATP level of cerebral tissue. More interestingly, neurological deficit, brain edema, glutamate concentration, IL-1β and TNF-α levels were ameliorated significantly in mice treated with OA combined with CGS21680. The combined treatment exhibited better therapeutic effects than single OA treatment. We also observed that GOT activity was enhanced in single CGS21680 treatment group, and both the GOT mRNA level and GOT activity were up-regulated in early-stage combined treatment group. These results suggest that A2AR can improve the efficiency of GOT and potentiate the ability of OA to metabolize glutamate. This may be the mechanism that A2AR activation in combination group augmented the neuroprotective effect of OA rather than aggravated the brain damages. Taken together, the present study provides a new insight for the clinical treatment of TBI with A2AR agonists and OA.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is no approved pharmaceutical intervention for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Fatigue in these patients can last for decades. Long COVID may continue to ME/CFS, and currently, it is estimated that up to 20 million Americans have significant symptoms after COVID, and the most common symptom is fatigue. Anhydrous Enol-Oxaloacetate, (AEO) a nutritional supplement, has been anecdotally reported to relieve physical and mental fatigue and is dimished in ME/CFS patients. Here, we examine the use of higher dosage AEO as a medical food to relieve pathological fatigue. METHODS: ME/CFS and Long-COVID patients were enrolled in an open label dose escalating \"Proof of Concept\" non-randomized controlled clinical trial with 500 mg AEO capsules. Control was provided by a historical ME/CFS fatigue trial and supporting meta-analysis study, which showed average improvement with oral placebo using the Chalder Scale of 5.9% improvement from baseline. At baseline, 73.7% of the ME/CFS patients were women, average age was 47 and length of ME/CFS from diagnosis was 8.9 years. The Long-COVID patients were a random group that responded to social media advertising (Face Book) with symptoms for at least 6 months. ME/CFS patients were given separate doses of 500 mg BID (N = 23), 1,000 mg BID (N = 29) and 1000 mg TID (N = 24) AEO for six weeks. Long COVID patients were given 500 mg AEO BID (N = 22) and 1000 mg AEO (N = 21), again over a six-week period. The main outcome measure was to compare baseline scoring with results at 6 weeks with the Chalder Fatigue Score (Likert Scoring) versus historical placebo. The hypothesis being tested was formulated prior to data collection. RESULTS: 76 ME/CFS patients (73.7% women, median age of 47) showed an average reduction in fatigue at 6 weeks as measured by the \"Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire\" of 22.5% to 27.9% from baseline (P < 0.005) (Likert scoring). Both physical and mental fatigue were significantly improved over baseline and historical placebo. Fatigue amelioration in ME/CFS patients increased in a dose dependent manner from 21.7% for 500 mg BID to 27.6% for 1000 mg Oxaloacetate BID to 33.3% for 1000 mg TID. Long COVID patients' fatigue was significantly reduced by up to 46.8% in 6-weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Significant reductions in physical and metal fatigue for ME/CFS and Long-COVID patients were seen after 6 weeks of treatment. As there has been little progress in providing fatigue relief for the millions of ME/CFS and Long COVID patients, anhydrous enol oxaloacetate may bridge this important medical need. Further study of oxaloacetate supplementation for the treatment of ME/CFS and Long COVID is warranted.

It has been reported that glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase 1 (GOT1) is low-expressed in GBM and patients with high-expressed GOT1 have better prognosis. However, the effect and mechanism of GOT1 on glycolysis and malignant phenotypes of GBM cells are still unclear. METHODS: The expression differences of GOT1 between GBM parenchyma and adjacent tissues were detected. The prognosis and clinical data with different levels of GOT1 were also analyzed. The glucose consumption, production of lactate and pyruvate were measured after GOT1 was knocked down or overexpressed. The effects of GOT1 on GBM cell's malignant phenotypes were analyzed by Western blot, CCK-8 assay, and flow cytometry. The relationship between GOT1 and pyruvate carboxylase (PC) was examined by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: GOT1 was expressed little in GBM, and patients with highly expressed GOT1 had longer survival periods. Overexpressed GOT1 inhibited the glycolysis and malignant phenotypes of GBM cells. 2-DG treatment could partially reverse the enhancement of malignant phenotypes caused by knockdown of GOT1. The expression of GOT1 was positively correlated with PC. The inhibitory effect of GOT1 on glycolysis could be partially reversed by PC's knockdown. CONCLUSIONS: GOT1 could impair glycolysis by interacting with PC and further inhibit the malignant phenotypes of GBM cells.",

Oxaloacetate treatment has a neuroprotective effect in rodent models of seizure and neurodegeneration. Therefore, we treated the ALS model superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) G93A mice with oxaloacetate and evaluated their neuromuscular function and lifespan. Treatment with oxaloacetate beginning in the presymptomatic stage significantly improved neuromuscular strength measured during the symptomatic stage in the injected mice compared to the non-treated group. Oxaloacetate treatment starting in the symptomatic stage significantly delayed limb paralysis compared with the non-treated group. For lifespan analysis, oxaloacetate treatment did not show a statistically significant positive effect, but the treatment did not shorten the lifespan. Mechanistically, SOD1G93A mice showed increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and peroxisome proliferative activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) mRNAs in the spinal cord. However, oxaloacetate treatment reverted these abnormal levels to that of wild-type mice. Similarly, the altered expression level of total NF-κB protein returned to that of wild-type mice with oxaloacetate treatment. These results suggest that the beneficial effects of oxaloacetate treatment in SOD1G93A mice may reflect the effects on neuroinflammation or bioenergetic stress.",

      "abstract": "Molybdenum cofactor deficiency and isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency are two rare genetic disorders that are caused by impairment of the mitochondrial enzyme sulfite oxidase. Sulfite oxidase is catalyzing the terminal reaction of cellular cysteine catabolism, the oxidation of sulfite to sulfate. Absence of sulfite oxidase leads to the accumulation of sulfite, which has been identified as a cellular toxin. However, the molecular pathways leading to the production of sulfite are still not completely understood. In order to identify novel treatment options for both disorders, the understanding of cellular cysteine catabolism - and its alterations upon loss of sulfite oxidase - is of utmost importance. Here we applied a new detection method of sulfite in cellular extracts to dissect the contribution of cytosolic and mitochondrial glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) in the transformation of cysteine sulfinic acid to sulfite and pyruvate. We found that the cytosolic isoform GOT1 is primarily responsible for the production of sulfite. Moreover, loss of sulfite oxidase activity results in the accumulation of sulfite, H2S and persulfidated cysteine and glutathione, which is consistent with an increase of SQR protein levels. Surprisingly, none of the known H2S-producing pathways were found to be upregulated under conditions of sulfite toxicity suggesting an alternative route of sulfite-induced shift from oxidative to H2S dependent cysteine catabolism.",

In ischemic stroke, we have demonstrated that recombinant GOT1 acts as a novel neuroprotective treatment against the excess of extracellular glutamate that accumulates in the brain following ischemic stroke. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of GOT1 on brain metabolism and on the ischemic damage in a rat model of ischemic stroke by means of a specific antibody developed against this enzyme. Inhibition of GOT1 caused higher brain glutamate and lactate levels and this response was associated with larger ischemic lesion. This study represents the first demonstration that the inhibition of the blood GOT1 activity leads to more severe ischemic damage and poorer outcome and supports the protective role of GOT1 against ischemic insults.",

Preclinical studies find oxaloacetate (OAA) enhances bioenergetics, but human safety and target engagement data are lacking. METHODS: We orally administered 500 or 1000 mg OAA, twice daily for 1 month, to AD participants (n = 15 each group) and monitored safety and tolerability. To assess brain metabolism engagement, we performed fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy before and after the intervention. We also assessed pharmacokinetics and cognitive performance. RESULTS: Both doses were safe and tolerated. Compared to the lower dose, the higher dose benefited FDG PET glucose uptake across multiple brain regions (P < .05), and the higher dose increased parietal and frontoparietal glutathione (P < .05). We did not demonstrate consistent blood level changes and cognitive scores did not improve. CONCLUSIONS: 1000 mg OAA, taken twice daily for 1 month, is safe in AD patients and engages brain energy metabolism.",

Among these, recent studies have demonstrated that glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase 1 (GOT1) plays key roles in maintaining redox homeostasis and proliferation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDA). This suggests that small molecule inhibitors of GOT1 could have utility for the treatment of PDA. However, the development of GOT1 inhibitors has been challenging, and no compound has yet demonstrated selectivity for GOT1-dependent cell metabolism or selective growth inhibition of PDA cell lines. In contrast, potent inhibitors that covalently bind to the transaminase cofactor pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP), within the active site of the enzyme, have been reported for kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) and gamma-aminobutyric acid aminotransferase (GABA-AT). Given the drug discovery successes with these transaminases, we aimed to identify PLP-dependent suicide substrate-type GOT1 inhibitors.

      "abstract": "Hepatocyte lipotoxicity is characterized by aberrant mitochondrial metabolism, which predisposes cells to oxidative stress and apoptosis. Previously, we reported that translocation of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria of palmitate-treated hepatocytes activates anaplerotic flux from glutamine to α-ketoglutarate (αKG), which subsequently enters the citric acid cycle (CAC) for oxidation. We hypothesized that increased glutamine anaplerosis fuels elevations in CAC flux and oxidative stress following palmitate treatment. To test this hypothesis, primary rat hepatocytes or immortalized H4IIEC3 rat hepatoma cells were treated with lipotoxic levels of palmitate while modulating anaplerotic pathways leading to αKG. We found that culture media supplemented with glutamine, glutamate, or dimethyl-αKG increased palmitate lipotoxicity compared with media that lacked these anaplerotic substrates. Knockdown of glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase activity significantly reduced the lipotoxic effects of palmitate, whereas knockdown of glutamate dehydrogenase (Glud1) had no effect on palmitate lipotoxicity. 13C flux analysis of H4IIEC3 cells co-treated with palmitate and the pan-transaminase inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid confirmed that reductions in lipotoxic markers were associated with decreases in anaplerosis, CAC flux, and oxygen consumption. Taken together, these results demonstrate that lipotoxic palmitate treatments enhance anaplerosis in cultured rat hepatocytes, causing a shift to aberrant transaminase metabolism that fuels CAC dysregulation and oxidative stress.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 1 (GOT1) regulates cellular metabolism through coordinating the utilization of carbohydrates and amino acids to meet nutrient requirements. KRAS mutated cancer cells were recently shown to rely on GOT1 to support long-term cell proliferation. The aim of the present study was to address the role of GOT1 in the metabolic adaption of cancer cells. METHODS: GOT1-null and knockdown cell lines were established through CRISPR/Cas9 and shRNA techniques. The growth properties, colony formation ability, autophagy and selected gene expression profiles were analysed. Glucose deprivation decreased the viability of the GOT1-null cells and rescue experiments were conducted with selected intermediates. The redox NADH/NAD+ homeostasis as well as lactate secretion were determined. GOT1 expression levels and correlation with survival rates were analysed in selected tumor databases. RESULTS: Inhibition of GOT1 sensitized the cancer cells to glucose deprivation, which was partially counteracted by oxaloacetate and phosphoenol pyruvate, metabolic intermediates downstream of GOT1. Moreover, GOT1-null cells accumulated NADH and displayed a decreased ratio of NADH/NAD+ with nutrient depletion. The relevance of GOT1 as a potential target in cancer therapy was supported by a lung adenocarcinoma RNA-seq data set as well as the GEO:GSE database of metastatic melanoma where GOT1 expression was increased. High levels of GOT1 were further linked to poor survival as analysed by the GEPIA web tool, in thyroid and breast carcinoma and in lung adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests an important role of GOT1 to coordinate the glycolytic and the oxidative phosphorylation pathways in KRAS mutated cancer cells. GOT1 is crucial to provide oxaloacetate at low glucose levels, likely to maintain the redox homeostasis. Our data suggest GOT1 as a possible target in cancer therapy.",

Recently, accumulating evidence indicates oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis can be regulated with each other. Thus, we suggest that the glycolysis of cancer cells is inhibited by restoring or improving OXPHOS in cancer cells. In our study, we found that oxaloacetate (OA) induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells in vivo and in vitro. Meanwhile, we found that OA induced a decrease in the energy metabolism of HepG2 cells. Further results showed that the expression and activity of glycolytic enzymes were decreased with OA treatment. Conversely, the expression and activity of enzymes involved in the TCA cycle and OXPHOS were increased with OA treatment. The results indicate that OA can inhibit glycolysis through enhancement of OXPHOS. In addition, OA-mediated suppression of HIF1α, p-Akt, and c-myc led to a decrease in glycolysis level. Therefore, OA has the potential to be a novel anticancer drug.",

Our previous work demonstrated the ability of glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) to metabolize neurotoxic glutamate in the stroke-affected brain. Here, we seek to identify small-molecule inducers of GOT expression to mitigate ischemic stroke injury. From a panel of phytoestrogen isoflavones, biochanin A (BCA) was identified as the most potent inducer of GOT gene expression in neural cells. BCA significantly increased GOT mRNA and protein expression at 24 h and protected against glutamate-induced cell death. Of note, this protection was lost when GOT was knocked down. To validate outcomes in vivo, C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with BCA (5 and 10 mg/kg) for 4 wk and subjected to ischemic stroke. BCA levels were significantly increased in plasma and brain of mice. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated increased GOT protein expression in the brain. BCA attenuated stroke lesion volume as measured by 9.4T MRI and improved sensorimotor function-this protection was lost with GOT knockdown. BCA increased luciferase activity in cells that were transfected with the pERRE3tk-LUC plasmid, which demonstrated transactivation of GOT. This increase was lost when estrogen-related receptor response element sites were mutated. Taken together, BCA represents a natural phytoestrogen that mitigates stroke-induced injury by inducing GOT expression.-Khanna, S., Stewart, R., Gnyawali, S., Harris, H., Balch, M., Spieldenner, J., Sen, C.

Studies of complex II are clinically important since new roles for this enzyme have recently emerged in cell signalling, cancer biology, immune response and neurodegeneration. Oxaloacetate (OAA) is an intermediate of the TCA cycle and at the same time is an inhibitor of complex II with high affinity (Kd~10(-8)M). Whether or not OAA inhibition of complex II is a physiologically relevant process is a significant, but still controversial topic. We found that complex II from mouse heart and brain tissue has similar affinity to OAA and that only a fraction of the enzyme in isolated mitochondrial membranes (30.2±6.0% and 56.4±5.6% in the heart and brain, respectively) is in the free, active form. Since OAA could bind to complex II during isolation, we established a novel approach to deplete OAA in the homogenates at the early stages of isolation. In heart, this treatment significantly increased the fraction of free enzyme, indicating that OAA binds to complex II during isolation. In brain the OAA-depleting system did not significantly change the amount of free enzyme, indicating that a large fraction of complex II is already in the OAA-bound inactive form. Furthermore, short-term ischemia resulted in a dramatic decline of OAA in tissues, but it did not change the amount of free complex II. Our data show that in brain OAA is an endogenous effector of complex II, potentially capable of modulating the activity of the enzyme.",

These alterations represent therapeutic targets and provide an underlying rationale for modifying brain bioenergetics in AD-affected persons. Preclinical studies in cultured cells and mice found that administering oxaloacetate (OAA), a Krebs cycle and gluconeogenesis intermediate, enhanced bioenergetic fluxes and upregulated some brain bioenergetic infrastructure-related parameters. We therefore conducted a study to provide initial data on the tolerability and pharmacokinetics of OAA in AD subjects. Six AD subjects received OAA 100 mg capsules twice a day for one month. The intervention was well-tolerated. Blood level measurements following ingestion of a 100 mg OAA capsule showed modest increases in OAA concentrations, but pharmacokinetic analyses were complicated by relatively high amounts of endogenous OAA. We conclude that OAA 100 mg capsules twice per day for one month are safe in AD subjects but do not result in a consistent and clear increase in the OAA blood level, thus necessitating future clinical studies to evaluate higher doses."

      "abstract": "We tested how the addition of oxaloacetate (OAA) to SH-SY5Y cells affected bioenergetic fluxes and infrastructure, and compared the effects of OAA to malate, pyruvate, and glucose deprivation. OAA displayed pro-glycolysis and pro-respiration effects. OAA pro-glycolysis effects were not a consequence of decarboxylation to pyruvate because unlike OAA, pyruvate lowered the glycolysis flux. Malate did not alter glycolysis flux and reduced mitochondrial respiration. Glucose deprivation essentially eliminated glycolysis and increased mitochondrial respiration. OAA increased, while malate decreased, the cell NAD+/NADH ratio. Cytosolic malate dehydrogenase 1 protein increased with OAA treatment, but not with malate or glucose deprivation. Glucose deprivation increased protein levels of ATP citrate lyase, an enzyme which produces cytosolic OAA, whereas OAA altered neither ATP citrate lyase mRNA nor protein levels. OAA, but not glucose deprivation, increased cytochrome oxidase subunit 2, PGC1α, PGC1β, and PGC1 related co-activator protein levels. OAA increased total and phosphorylated SIRT1 protein. We conclude that adding OAA to SH-SY5Y cells can support or enhance both glycolysis and respiration fluxes. These effects appear to depend, at least partly, on OAA causing a shift in the cell redox balance to a more oxidized state, that it is not a glycolysis pathway intermediate, and possibly its ability to act in an anaplerotic fashion. We examined how oxaloacetate (OAA) affects bioenergetic fluxes. To advance the understanding of how OAA mediates these changes, we compared the effects of OAA to malate, pyruvate, and glucose deprivation. We further examined how OAA affects levels of enzymes that facilitate its cytosolic metabolism, and found OAA increased the expression of malate dehydrogenase 1 (MDH1-cytosolic). We propose the following: OAA supports both glycolysis and respiration fluxes, shifts the cell redox balance toward a more oxidized state, and acts in an anaplerotic fashion.

      "abstract": "A high proportion of research relating to cerebral ischemia focuses on neuroprotection. The application of compounds normally present in the organism is popular, because they do not greatly influence the synaptic activity by receptor modulation, and can be administered without serious side effects. Oxaloacetate (OxAc) and acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) are such favorable endogenous molecules. ALC can exert a protective effect by improving the energy state of the neurons under ischemic conditions. A promising neuroprotective strategy is glutamate scavenging, which can be achieved by the intravenous administration of OxAc. This study involved the possible protective effects of ALC and OxAc in different post-treatment protocols against long-term potentiation (LTP) impairment. Ischemia was induced in rats by 2-vessel occlusion, which led to a decreased LTP relative to the control group. High-dose (200 mg/kg) ALC or OxAc post-treatment resulted in a higher potentiation relative to the 2VO group, but it did not reach the control level, whereas low-dose ALC (100 mg/kg) in combination with OxAc completely restored the LTP function. Many previous studies have concluded that ALC can be protective only as pretreatment. The strategy described here reveals that ALC can also be neuroprotective when utilized as post-treatment against ischemia.",

      "abstract": "During an ischemic event, the well-regulated glutamate (Glu) homeostasis is disturbed, which gives rise to extremely high levels of this excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain tissues. It was earlier reported that the administration of oxaloacetate (OxAc) as a Glu scavenger reduces the Glu level in the brain by enhancing the brain-to-blood Glu efflux. Here, we studied the neuroprotective effect of OxAc administration in a new focal ischemic model in rats. Occlusion of the middle cerebral artery resulted in immediate reduction of the somatosensory-evoked responses (SERs), and the amplitudes remained at the reduced level throughout the whole ischemic period. On reperfusion, the SERs started to increase, but never reached the control level. OxAc proved to be protective, since the amplitudes started to recover even during the ischemia, and finally fully regained the control level. The findings of the histological measurements were in accordance with the electrophysiological data. After Fluoro Jade C staining, significantly fewer labeled cells were detected in the OxAc-treated group relative to the control. These results provide new evidence of the neuroprotective effect of OxAc against ischemic injury, which strengthens the likelihood of its future applicability as a novel neuroprotective agent for the treatment of ischemic stroke patients.",

      "abstract": "Blood glutamate scavenging is a novel and attractive protecting strategy to reduce the excitotoxic effect of extracellular glutamate released during ischemic brain injury. Glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 1 (GOT1) activation by means of oxaloacetate administration has been used to reduce the glutamate concentration in the blood. However, the protective effect of the administration of the recombinant GOT1 (rGOT1) enzyme has not been yet addressed in cerebral ischemia. The aim of this study was to analyze the protective effect of an effective dose of oxaloacetate and the human rGOT1 alone and in combination with a non-effective dose of oxaloacetate in an animal model of ischemic stroke. Sixty rats were subjected to a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Infarct volumes were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before treatment administration, and 24 h and 7 days after MCAO. Brain glutamate levels were determined by in vivo MR spectroscopy (MRS) during artery occlusion (80 min) and reperfusion (180 min). GOT activity and serum glutamate concentration were analyzed during the occlusion and reperfusion period. Somatosensory test was performed at baseline and 7 days after MCAO. The three treatments tested induced a reduction in serum and brain glutamate levels, resulting in a reduction in infarct volume and sensorimotor deficit. Protective effect of rGOT1 supplemented with oxaloacetate at 7 days persists even when treatment was delayed until at least 2 h after onset of ischemia. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the combination of human rGOT1 with low doses of oxaloacetate seems to be a successful approach for stroke treatment.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stroke lead to elevated levels of glutamate in the brain that negatively affect the neurological outcomes in both animals and humans. Intravenous administration of glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) enzymes can be used to lower the blood glutamate levels and to improve the neurological outcome following TBI and stroke. The objective of this study was to analyze the pharmacokinetics and to determine the glutamate-lowering effects of GOT and GPT enzymes in naïve rats. We determined the time course of serum GOT, GPT, and glutamate levels following a single intravenous administration of two different doses of each one of the studied enzymes. Forty-six male rats were randomly assigned into one of 5 treatment groups: saline (control), human GOT at dose 0.03 and 0.06 mg/kg and porcine GPT at dose 0.6 and 1.2 mg/kg. Blood samples were collected at baseline, 5 min, and 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h after the drug injection and GOT, GPT and glutamate levels were determined. The pharmacokinetics of both GOT and GPT followed one-compartment model, and both enzymes exhibited substantial glutamate-lowering effects following intravenous administration. Analysis of the pharmacokinetic data indicated that both enzymes were distributed predominantly in the blood (central circulation) and did not permeate to the peripheral organs and tissues. Several-hour delay was present between the time course of the enzyme levels and the glutamate-lowering effects (leading to clock-wise hysteresis on concentration-effect curves), apparently due to the time that is required to affect the pool of serum glutamate. We conclude that the interaction between the systemically-administered enzymes (GOT and GPT) and the glutamate takes place in the central circulation. Thus, glutamate-lowering effects of GOT and GPT apparently lead to redistribution of the excess glutamate from the brain's extracellular fluid into the blood and can reduce secondary brain injury due to glutamate neurotoxicity. The outcomes of this study regarding the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the GOT and GPT enzymes will be subsequently verified in clinical studies that can lead to design of effective neuroprotective treatment strategies in patients with traumatic brain diseases and stroke.",

This study investigates the efficacy of blood glutamate scavengers oxaloacetate and pyruvate in the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in rats. Isotonic saline, 250 mg/kg oxaloacetate, or 125 mg/kg pyruvate was injected intravenously in 60 rats, 60 minutes after induction of SAH at a rate of 0.1 ml/100 g/min for 30 minutes. There were 20 additional rats that were used as a sham-operated group. Blood samples were collected at baseline and 90 minutes after SAH. Neurological performance was assessed at 24 h after SAH. In half of the rats, glutamate concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid were measured 24 h after SAH. For the remaining half, the blood brain barrier permeability in the frontal and parieto-occipital lobes was measured 48 h after SAH. Blood glutamate levels were reduced in rats treated with oxaloacetate or pyruvate at 90 minutes after SAH (p < 0.001). Cerebrospinal fluid glutamate was reduced in rats treated with pyruvate (p < 0.05). Neurological performance was significantly improved in rats treated with oxaloacetate (p < 0.05) or pyruvate (p < 0.01). The breakdown of the blood brain barrier was reduced in the frontal lobe in rats treated with pyruvate (p < 0.05) and in the parieto-occipital lobes in rats treated with either pyruvate (p < 0.01) or oxaloacetate (p < 0.01).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Decreasing blood glutamate concentrations after traumatic brain injury accelerates brain-to-blood glutamate efflux, leading to improved neurologic outcomes. The authors hypothesize that treatment with blood glutamate scavengers should reduce neuronal cell loss, whereas administration of glutamate should worsen outcomes. The authors performed histologic studies of neuronal survival in the rat hippocampus after traumatic brain injury and treatment with blood glutamate scavengers. METHODS: Traumatic brain injury was induced on anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats by a standardized weight drop. Intravenous treatment groups included saline (control), oxaloacetate, pyruvate, and glutamate. Neurologic outcome was assessed using a Neurological Severity Score at 1 h, and 1, 2, 7, 14, 21, 28 days. Blood glutamate was determined at baseline and 90 min. Four weeks after traumatic brain injury, a histologic analysis of surviving neurons was performed. RESULTS: Oxaloacetate and pyruvate treatment groups demonstrated increased neuronal survival (oxaloacetate 2,200 ± 37, pyruvate 2,108 ± 137 vs. control 1,978 ± 46, P < 0.001, mean ± SD). Glutamate treatment revealed decreased neuronal survival (1,715 ± 48, P < 0.001). Treatment groups demonstrated favorable neurologic outcomes at 24 and 48 h (Neurological Severity Score at 24 and 48 h: 5.5 (1-8.25), 5 (1.75-7.25), P = 0.02 and 3(1-6.5), 4 (1.75-4.5), P = 0.027, median ± corresponding interquartile range). Blood glutamate concentrations were decreased in the oxaloacetate and pyruvate treatment groups. Administration of oxaloacetate and pyruvate was not shown to have any adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: The authors demonstrate that the blood glutamate scavengers oxaloacetate and pyruvate provide neuroprotection after traumatic brain injury, expressed both by reduced neuronal loss in the hippocampus and improved neurologic outcomes. The findings of this study may bring about new therapeutic possibilities in a variety of clinical settings.",

      "abstract": "As ischemic stroke is associated with an excessive release of glutamate into the neuronal extracellular space, a decrease in blood glutamate levels could provide a mechanism to remove it from the brain tissue, by increasing the brain-blood gradient. In this regard, the ability of glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) to metabolize glutamate in blood could represent a potential neuroprotective tool for ischemic stroke. This study aimed to determine the neuroprotective effects of GOT in an animal model of cerebral ischemia by means of a middle cerebral arterial occlusion (MCAO) following the Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) group guidelines. In this animal model, oxaloacetate-mediated GOT activation inhibited the increase of blood and cerebral glutamate after MCAO. This effect is reflected in a reduction of infarct size, smaller edema volume, and lower sensorimotor deficits with respect to controls. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirmed that the increase of glutamate levels in the brain parenchyma after MCAO is inhibited after oxaloacetate-mediated GOT activation. These findings show the capacity of the GOT to remove glutamate from the brain by means of blood glutamate degradation, and suggest the applicability of this enzyme as an efficient and novel neuroprotective tool against ischemic stroke.",

Since increased release of glutamate during epileptic seizures can lead to excitotoxicity and neuronal cell death, we tested the hypothesis that glutamate scavenging mediated by pyruvate and oxaloacetate systemic administration could have a neuroprotective effect in rats subjected to status epilepticus (SE). SE was induced by a single dose of pilocarpine (350mg/kgi.p.). Thirty minutes after SE onset, a single dose of pyruvate (250mg/kgi.p.), oxaloacetate (1.4mg/kgi.p.), or both substances was administrated. Acute neuronal loss in hippocampal regions CA1 and hilus was quantitatively determined five hours after SE onset, using the optical fractionator method for stereological cell counting. Apoptotic cascade in the hippocampus was also investigated seven days after SE using caspase-1 and -3 activity assays. SE-induced neuronal loss in CA1 was completely prevented in rats treated with pyruvate plus oxaloacetate. The SE-induced caspase-1 activation was significantly reduced when rats were treated with oxaloacetate or pyruvate plus oxaloacetate. The treatment with pyruvate and oxaloacetate caused a neuroprotective effect in rats subjected to pilocarpine-induced SE.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Treatment with oxaloacetate after traumatic brain injury has been shown to decrease blood glutamate levels and protect against the neurotoxic effects of glutamate on the brain. A number of potential mechanisms have been suggested to explain oxaloacetate-induced neuroprotection. We hypothesize that the primary mechanism by which intravenous oxaloacetate provides neuroprotection is by activation of the blood glutamate-scavenging enzyme glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase, increasing thereby the driving force for the efflux of excess glutamate from brain interstitial fluids into blood. If so, coadministration of maleate, a glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase-blocker is expected to prevent the neuroprotective effects of oxaloacetate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A neurological severity score (NSS) was measured 1 hour after closed head injury (CHI) in rats. Then, rats received 30 microL/min/100 g infusion of saline, or 1 mmol/100 g solution of oxaloacetate, maleate, or a mixture of oxaloacetate and maleate. NSS was reassessed at 24 and 48 hour after CHI. Blood glutamate and glucose levels were measured at 0, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. RESULTS: NSS improved significantly at 24 hour (P<0.001) and 48 hour (P<0.001) only in the rats treated with oxaloacetate. Blood glutamate decreased significantly in the oxaloacetate-treated group at 90 minute (at the conclusion of oxaloacetate administration) (P<0.00001), but not in the control, maleate or oxaloacetate+maleate groups. A strong correlation r2=0.86 was found to exist between the percent decrease in blood glutamate levels and percent improvement in NSS. DISCUSSION: The results of this study demonstrate that the primary mechanism by which oxaloacetate provides neuroprotective activity after CHI is related to its blood glutamate scavenging activity. Management of blood glutamate concentration may have important implications in the treatment of acute brain conditions, including CHI and stroke.",

      "abstract": "Citrate synthase is an archetypal carbon-carbon bond forming enzyme. It promotes the conversion of oxaloacetate (OAA) to citrate by catalyzing the deprotonation (enolization) of acetyl-CoA, followed by nucleophilic attack of the enolate form of this substrate on OAA to form a citryl-CoA intermediate and subsequent hydrolysis. OAA is strongly bound to the active site and its alpha-carbonyl group is polarized. This polarization has been demonstrated spectroscopically, [(Kurz et al., Biochemistry 1985;24:452-457; Kurz and Drysdale, Biochemistry 1987;26:2623-2627)] and has been suggested to be an important catalytic strategy. Substrate polarization is believed to be important in many enzymes. The first step, formation of the acetyl-CoA enolate intermediate, is thought to be rate-limiting in the mesophilic (pig/chicken) enzyme. We have examined the effects of substrate polarization on this key step using quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods. Free energy profiles have been calculated by AM1/CHARMM27 umbrella sampling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, together with potential energy profiles. To study the influence of OAA polarization, profiles were calculated with different polarization of the OAA alpha-carbonyl group. The results indicate that OAA polarization influences catalysis only marginally but has a larger effect on intermediate stabilization. Different levels of treatment of OAA are compared (MM or QM), and its polarization in the protein and in water analyzed at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d)/CHARMM27 level. Analysis of stabilization by individual residues shows that the enzyme mainly stabilizes the enolate intermediate (not the transition state) through electrostatic (including hydrogen bond) interactions: these contribute much more than polarization of OAA.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondrial Complex II (succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is purified in a partially inactivated state, which can be activated by removal of tightly bound oxaloacetate (E.B. Kearney, et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 49 1115-1121). We crystallized Complex II in the presence of oxaloacetate or with the endogenous inhibitor bound. The structure showed a ligand essentially identical to the \"malate-like intermediate\" found in Shewanella Flavocytochrome c crystallized with fumarate (P. Taylor, et al., Nat. Struct. Biol. 6 1108-1112) Crystallization of Complex II in the presence of excess fumarate also gave the malate-like intermediate or a mixture of that and fumarate at the active site. In order to more conveniently monitor the occupation state of the dicarboxylate site, we are developing a library of UV/Vis spectral effects induced by binding different ligands to the site. Treatment with fumarate results in rapid development of the fumarate difference spectrum and then a very slow conversion into a species spectrally similar to the OAA-liganded complex. Complex II is known to be capable of oxidizing malate to the enol form of oxaloacetate (Y.O. Belikova, et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 936 1-9). The observations above suggest it may also be capable of interconverting fumarate and malate. It may be useful for understanding the mechanism and regulation of the enzyme to identify the malate-like intermediate and its pathway of formation from oxaloacetate or fumarate.",

An intraperitoneal (ip) injection of kainic acid (45 mg/kg) produced broad-spectrum limbic and severe sustained seizures in all of the treated mice. The seizures were abolished when alpha-ketoglutarate (2 g/kg) or oxaloacetate (1 g/kg) was injected intraperitoneally in the animals 1 min before kainic acid administration. In addition, the administration of kainic acid caused damage to mtDNA in brain frontal and middle cortex of mice. These effects were completely abolished by the ip preinjection of alpha-ketoglutarate (2 g/kg) or oxaloacetate (1 g/kg). In vitro exposure of kainic acid (0.25, 0.5 or 1.0 mM) to brain homogenate inflicted damage to mtDNA in a concentration-dependent manner. The damage of mtDNA induced by 1.0 mM kainic acid was attenuated by the co-treatment with alpha-ketoglutarate (2.5 or 5.0 mM) or oxaloacetate (0.75 or 1.0 mM). Furthermore, in vivo and in vitro exposure of kainic acid elicited an increase in lipid peroxidation. However, the increased lipid peroxidation was completely inhibited by cotreatment of alpha-ketoglutarate or oxaloacetate. These results suggest that alpha-keto acids such as alpha-ketoglutarate and oxaloacetate play a role in the inhibition of seizures and subsequent mtDNA damage induced by the excitotoxic/neurotoxic agent, kainic acid.",

We provide the evidence that NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase (MDH) is involved in the antioxidant role in preventing H(2)O(2) or γ-radiation-induced damage in Escherichia coli through the action of oxaloacetate. The E. colimdh mutant strain defective in MDH activity was more sensitive to H(2)O(2) or γ-radiation than was the wild type strain, when challenged in the exponential growth phase. The mdh mutant cells pretreated with oxaloacetate (2.5 mM), a product of NAD-dependent MDH activity, prior to H(2)O(2) treatment or γ-irradiation are resistant to H(2)O(2) or γ-radiation-induced damage, so cell survivability is restored to similar levels with the wild type. The SOS induction of umu'-'lacZ fusion gene by H(2)O(2) is significantly repressed by pretreatment of oxaloacetate in a dose-dependent way. These results indicate that oxaloacetate effectively protects E. coli cells against damage caused by oxidative stress. Oxaloacetate strongly prevented the DNA strand breaks by OH in a metal-catalyzed oxidation (MCO) system that generated H(2)O(2) as a mediator. By contrast, the prevention of DNA damage by oxaloacetate in an γ-irradiation system that directly generates OH from H(2)O in vitro was far less than that in an MCO system. Our results demonstrated that oxaloacetate, metabolite of NAD-dependent MDH action, plays a role as an antioxidant, possibly by scavenging H(2)O(2)."

Extracts for studies on in vivo PEPC phosphorylation were prepared from barley leaf protoplasts by rapid filtration, fractionating the cell within less than 1 s. Measurements of in vitro PEPC activity were performed on samples quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen to break the cell and stop metabolism and thus preserve the in vivo activation state. The relative PEPC phosphorylation state increased upon illumination and decreased upon redarkening under photorespiratory and non-photorespiratory conditions. PEPC activity measured in the presence of malate (3 mM) under photorespiratory conditions showed the same response indicating that a light-induced increase in PEPC activity and decrease in malate sensitivity is caused by an increased phosphorylation level of the PEPC protein. PEPC activity was pH dependent. At the physiological cytosolic pH, activity was suboptimal, but most sensitive towards malate inhibition and glucose 6-phosphate stimulation. The presence of malate increased the sensitivity of PEPC activity towards pH changes. The response of PEPC activity to changing pH was not affected by changes in the activation state of the enzyme. The Km (phosphoenolpyruvate, PEP) is about 1 mM. Upon illumination the Km (PEP) decrease significantly. Vmax was unaffected by the light treatment. The presence of physiological concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate decreased Km (PEP) 5- to 10-fold and increased Vmax by about 35%. The effect of glucose 6-phosphate was strongest (up to 7-fold) at subsaturating PEP concentrations stimulating PEPC activity to nearly maximal rates. The results show that an increase in PEPC phosphorylation state causes an increase in PEPC activity as well as in substrate affinity leading to an increased production of OAA in the light.",

We present a quantitative assay for physiological concentrations of these metabolites by isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Samples are spiked with the corresponding internal standards of [U-13C4]oxaloacetate and [U-13C5] alpha-ketoglutarate prior to their treatment with hydroxylamine. After ethyl acetate extraction and evaporation of the organic phases, the oximes are converted to t-butyldimethylsilyl ethers and analyzed by selected ion monitoring gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the [M-57]+ ion in electron impact. Although the internal standards of [U-13C4]oxaloacetate and [U-13C5] alpha-ketoglutarate are not commercially available, they can easily be synthesized in 30 min by reacting [1,2,3,6-13C4]citrate with citrate lyase, and L-[U-13C5]glutamate with pyruvate and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase, respectively. Because of their chemical instability, the internal standards are prepared on the day of the analysis. A stock solution of [1,2,3,6-13C4]citrate is prepared from L-[U-13C4]aspartate using citrate synthase and glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase and then purified and kept frozen until required. The detection limit of the method is 0.05 nmol in a given sample. The method was applied to measurements of oxaloacetate and alpha-ketoglutarate in human blood and rat liver.",

      "abstract": "3-Mercaptopicolinic acid (3-MPA), an inhibitor of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, was employed to study the role of organic acid decarboxylation during C(4) photosynthesis. Treatment of detached Panicum maximum leaves with 5 mm 3-MPA inhibited photosynthesis 70 to 75%. Oxygen was found to have no effect on the degree of inhibition. The postillumination (14)CO(2) burst associated with P. maximum photosynthesis was almost abolished by 5 mm 3-MPA. The turnover rates of malate and aspartate during C(4) photosynthesis were severely reduced as well as the rates of formation of C(3) cycle intermediates in P. maximum leaves treated with 3-MPA. These results are interpreted as direct evidence for the fixation of CO(2), arising from the decarboxylation of oxaloacetate, by the C(3) cycle in bundle sheath cells of P. maximum leaves."

      "abstract": "Benziman, Moshe (The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel), and N. Heller. Oxaloacetate decarboxylation and oxaloacetate-carbon dioxide exchange in Acetobacter xylinum. J. Bacteriol. 88:1678-1687. 1964.-Extracts of Acetobacter xylinum, prepared by sonic treatment, were shown to catalyze the decarboxylation of oxaloacetate (OAA) to pyruvate and CO(2), and the exchange of C(14)-carbon dioxide into the beta-carboxyl of OAA. Fractionation of the extracts with ammonium sulfate resulted in a 10-fold increase of the specific activity of the enzyme system catalyzing the CO(2) exchange and OAA decarboxylation reactions. The purified preparation catalyzed the exchange of pyruvate-3-C(14) into OAA. Similar pH curves with a pH optimum of 5.6 were obtained for the CO(2) exchange and OAA decarboxylation reactions. Both reactions require the presence of Mn(2+) or Mg(2+) ions. OAA decarboxylation was more strongly inhibited than the exchange of CO(2) by dialysis or metal-chelating agents. Avidin did not inhibit either reaction. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), guanosine triphosphate (GTP), guanosine diphosphate (GDP), pyrophosphate, or inorganic phosphate did not promote OAA decarboxylation and the CO(2)-exchange reaction catalyzed by the purified preparation. The purified preparation failed to catalyze the carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate in the presence of GDP, ADP, or inorganic phosphate, and that of pyruvate in the presence of ATP or GTP, even when supplemented with an OAA-trapping system. A scheme for OAA decarboxylation which could account for the observed exchange reactions and for the failure to obtain net fixation of CO(2) is proposed. The relation between the exchange reaction and the synthesis of cellulose from pyruvate by A. xylinum is discussed.",
