      "abstract": "Betalains differ from anthocyanins, and they cannot coexist in the same plant under natural conditions. The L-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase encoded by the DODA gene is a key step in the pathway of betalain biosynthesis in Caryophyllales plants. Amaranth is an important resource for the study and extraction of betalains. In order to clarify the function of AtrDODA family genes in betalain biosynthesis, we screened out three AtrDODA family gene members associated with betalains based on a genome database and RNA-seq databases of Amaranthus tricolor. Their characterization and expression pattern were further analyzed. The result of subcellular localization showed that all three AtrDODA members were located in the nucleus. Betacyanin and betaxanthin were promoted by paclobutrazol treatment in the leaves and stems of 'Suxian No.1' (red), while they were inhibited by gibberellin and darkness, which were consistent with the gene expression pattern of AtrDODAs. After heterologous transformation of the AtrDODA1-1 promoter into tobacco with GUS staining analysis, the promoter activity of AtrDODA1-1 of 'Suxian No.1' (red) amaranth was significantly higher than that of 'Suxian No.2' (green) amaranth. Furthermore, we analyzed the promoter activity of AtrDODA1-1 by GUS staining and qRT-PCR after sprayed exogenous MeJA and GA3 on the AtrDODA1-1 promoter transformed tobacco plants. The results showed that AtrDODA1-1 responded to plant hormones. This study could lay a foundation for revealing the biological functions of the amaranth DODA gene family, and provide new clues for the molecular mechanism of betalain synthesis."

Therefore, this study aimed to summarize the effectiveness of amaranth-based food interventions in improving hemoglobin concentration. METHOD: A randomized controlled trial and quasi-experimental study conducted since 2000 were searched in databases like PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane, AJOL, and Web of Science using prespecified keywords. Excel and Stata 17 were used for data extraction and analysis. Methodological quality was assessed using the JBI systematic review critical appraisal tool. Meta-analysis was done to estimate the overall intervention effect. RESULT: Ten studies were included from 1,032 articles (n = 1,225). The standardized mean hemoglobin concentration difference between groups was positive, with an overall effect of 0.08 (95%CI: -0.11, 0.26; p = 0.433), where I2 is 57.1%. CONCLUSION: The studies' interventions showed positive effects on hemoglobin concentration, but their effectiveness was not statistically significant. This suggests the need for research on the impact of different cooking methods on iron bioavailability, phytic iron ratio, and intervention effects across different populations.

Instant Controlled Pressure Drop (DIC) is an emerging technology used in many food industries. This study evaluates the effect of DIC treatment on amaranth. A. hypochondriacus was submitted to DIC treatments. Proximal analyses were assessed according to AOAC methodologies, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity were measured using standard methods. The application of DIC treatments did not yield significant alterations in amaranth composition. However, a marginal yet statistically significant reduction was observed in the protein percentage. Pressure and time exert a visible increase in the phenolic and flavonoid contents and in the antioxidant activity. The combination of 0.36 MPa and 22 s held the best results in both varieties studied. The significant increase in TPC, TFC, and antioxidant capacities following DIC treatment highlights the potential of this technology as a novel method for enhancing the functional attributes of amaranth.",

Liver cancer, kidney damage, anaemia, coma, hypertension and sporadic fever are among the illnesses that might result from consuming plants contaminated with heavy metals. This study assesses heavy metals (Cu, Mn, Cd, Cr, Ni and Pb) contamination and associated human health risks in amaranth (Amaranthus hybridus) grown near Don Bosco wastewater treatment plant in Iringa municipal, Tanzania. The study measured the concentration of heavy metals in amaranth vegetables using AAS. The level of Mn in the vegetables ranged between 67.90 and 493.44 mg/kg. The mean concentration of Mn obtained was 280.67 mg/kg, lower than the permissible levels set by FAO/WHO but above the limit as set by TBS. The Cu levels in amaranth ranged between 6.37 and 7.90 mg/kg, with a mean concentration of 7.24 mg/kg lower than the permissible limits set by FAO/WHO and TBS. The Cd levels in amaranth ranged between 0.05 and 0.35 mg/kg, and the mean concentration was 0.20 mg/kg below the permissible limit set by FAO/WHO and TBS. The calculated daily intake consumption fell in the following sequence: Mn > Cu > Cd. The hazard quotient (HQ) for Mn and Cd is 261.66 and 6.45, respectively, higher than the allowed limit (HQ < 1), and the hazard index (HI) for all samples was HI > 1, which indicates the consumption of these veggies could pose a harm to one's health. Additionally, the assessment of cancer risks revealed that Mn and Cd levels exceeded the USEPA recommended threshold of 1E-04, indicating a risk of one additional cancer case for every 10,000 individuals consuming amaranth vegetables. Thus, regularly checking for heavy metal contamination in vegetables is critical to minimize health hazards."

The surface modification by cold plasma is expected to enhance the native amaranth starch characteristics. Plasma treatment reduced the amylose content to a minimum of 9.00 % (230 V-15 min) resulting in a rise in relative crystallinity (74 %) and % syneresis (48.42 %). The hydratability remarkably elevated to a maximum rise of ~158 %, ~37 %, and ~41 % in solubility, absorption index, and swelling power respectively. Increased hydration, reduced the turbidity from 5.10 % (untreated) to a minimum of 3.42 % (230 V-15 min) of the pastes due to the cracked granular surface seen in electron micrographs. The rheological attributes improved up to 200 V-15 min with the peak viscosity of 5690 cP as the starch molecules tend to crosslink/aggregate which was confirmed by the increase in the COC stretching band area in FTIR spectra. On 30 % fat substitution with the plasma-treated amaranth starch (200 V-15 min), the mayonnaise viscosity increased significantly (p < 0.05) from ~7.60 Pa·s (control) to ~15.82 Pa·s (200 V-15 min) resulting in better emulsion stability (~82 %) and lightness. This proves the potential of cold plasma technology to modify under-utilized starches for sustainable food applications.",

      "abstract": "The study of gluten intolerance is a modern area of medical science. With the advent of new diagnostic capabilities and data on the forms of the disease, wide opportunities have opened up in optimizing the timing and invasiveness reducing of intervention during diagnosis and further monitoring of the child's health. However, despite all efforts, the basic method of treating all forms of gluten intolerance remains strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). It is known that GFD itself, as well as low adherence to its observance can lead to nutritional disorders. Therefore, the expansion of the diet at the expense of foods with high nutritional value will greatly contribute to the optimization of diet therapy and compensation for food restrictions. The purpose of the review was to evaluate the possibility of using amaranth products in a GFD to fill the need for nutrients in children with gluten intolerance. Material and methods. The search for literature data was carried out using PubMed, eLIBRARY, scholar.google platforms mainly over the last 5 years, using the keywords: gluten intolerance, children, amaranth, gluten-free diet. Results. An analysis of modern literary sources has shown that amaranth is a product of choice in diet therapy when following a GFD, since it is a pseudo-grain crop. The article presents data confirming the high nutritional value of amaranth due to the protein component and the features of the lipid fraction. The features of the amino acid composition and squalene content in comparison with other plant crops are discussed. The article contains information on the preservation of the beneficial properties of amaranth in finished foods, in particular, the addition of amaranth flour instead of corn starch increases the protein content by 32% and fiber by 152% in gluten-free bread without affecting the taste. The advantages of the chemical composition of amaranth are shown in comparison with other pseudo-cereals. The research results prove the effectiveness of using amaranth products in GFD to eliminate deficiency states in patients, normalize physical development in children with gluten intolerance, and increase patient adherence to the diet. Conclusion. The composition of amaranth and the available studies on the effectiveness of amaranth products consumption convincingly prove the advisability of using it in nutrition, especially under dietary restrictions or increased need for nutrients in childhood.",

      "abstract": "Microplastic (MP) pollution in terrestrial ecosystems is gaining attention, but there is limited research on its effects on leafy vegetables when combined with heavy metals. This study examines the impact of three MP types-polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polystyrene (PS)-at concentrations of 0.02, 0.05, and 0.1% w/w, along with cadmium (Cd) and biochar (B), on germination, growth, nutrient absorption, and heavy metal uptake in red amaranth (Amaranthus tricolor L.). We found that different MP types and concentrations did not negatively affect germination parameters like germination rate, relative germination rate, germination vigor, relative germination vigor, and germination speed. However, they increased phytotoxicity and decreased stress tolerance compared to an untreated control (CK1). The presence of MPs, particularly the PS type, reduced phosphorus and potassium uptake while enhancing Cd uptake. For example, treatments PS0.02CdB, PS0.05CdB, and PS0.1CdB increased Cd content in A. tricolor seedlings by 158%, 126%, and 44%, respectively, compared to the treatment CdB (CK2). Additionally, MP contamination led to reduced plant height, leaf dry matter content, and fresh and dry weights, indicating adverse effects on plant growth. Moreover, the presence of MPs increased bioconcentration factors and translocation factors for Cd, suggesting that MPs might act as carriers for heavy metal absorption in plants. On the positive side, the addition of biochar improved several root parameters, including root length, volume, surface area, and the number of root tips in the presence of MPs, indicating potential benefits for plant growth. Our study shows that the combination of MPs and Cd reduces plant growth and increases the risk of heavy metal contamination in food crops. Further research is needed to understand how different MP types and concentrations affect various plant species, which will aid in developing targeted mitigation strategies and in exploring the mechanisms through which MPs impact plant growth and heavy metal uptake. Finally, investigating the potential of biochar application in conjunction with other amendments in mitigating these effects could be key to addressing MP and heavy metal contamination in agricultural systems.",

      "abstract": "Amaranth species are C4 plants that are rich in betalains, and they are tolerant to salinity stress. A small family of plant-specific TCP transcription factors are involved in the response to salt stress. However, it has not been investigated whether amaranth TCP1 is involved in salt stress. We elucidated that the growth and physiology of amaranth were affected by salt concentrations of 50-200 mmol·L-1 NaCl. The data showed that shoot and root growth was inhibited at 200 mmol·L-1, while it was promoted at 50 mmol·L-1. Meanwhile, the plants also showed physiological responses, which indicated salt-induced injuries and adaptation to the salt stress. Moreover, AtrTCP1 promoted Arabidopsis seed germination. The germination rate of wild-type (WT) and 35S::AtrTCP1-GUS Arabidopsis seeds reached around 92% by the seventh day and 94.5% by the second day under normal conditions, respectively. With 150 mmol·L-1 NaCl treatment, the germination rate of the WT and 35S::AtrTCP1-GUS plant seeds was 27.0% by the seventh day and 93.0% by the fourth day, respectively. Under salt stress, the transformed 35S::AtrTCP1 plants bloomed when they grew 21.8 leaves after 16.2 days of treatment, which was earlier than the WT plants. The transformed Arabidopsis plants flowered early to resist salt stress. These results reveal amaranth's growth and physiological responses to salt stress, and provide valuable information on the AtrTCP1 gene.",

      "abstract": "To develop valuable applications for the invasive weed Palmer amaranth, we utilized it as a novel biochar source and explored its potential for methyl orange adsorption through the synthesis of chitosan-encapsulated Palmer amaranth biochar composite microspheres. Firstly, the prepared microspheres were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and were demonstrated to have a surface area of 19.6 m2/g, a total pore volume of 0.0664 cm3/g and an average pore diameter of 10.6 nm. Then, the influences of pH, dosage and salt type and concentration on the adsorption efficiency were systematically investigated alongside the adsorption kinetics, isotherms, and thermodynamics. The results reveal that the highest adsorption capacity of methyl orange was obtained at pH 4.0. The adsorption process was well fitted by a pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir isotherm model, and was spontaneous and endothermic. Through the Langmuir model, the maximal adsorption capacities of methyl orange were calculated as 495.0, 537.1 and 554.3 mg/g at 25.0, 35.0 and 45.0 °C, respectively. Subsequently, the adsorption mechanisms were elucidated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy investigations. It is indicated that electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, π-π interactions and hydrophobic interactions between methyl orange and the composite microspheres were pivotal for the adsorption process. Finally, the regeneration studies demonstrated that after five adsorption-desorption cycles, the microspheres still maintained 93.6% of their initial adsorption capacity for methyl orange. This work not only presents a promising method for mitigating methyl orange pollution but also offers a sustainable approach to managing Palmer amaranth invasion."

The Palmer amaranth populations, SYNR1 and SYNR2, exhibited higher survival rates (100%), aboveground biomass (c.a. 50%), and lower injury (25-30%) following mesotrione treatment than other populations studied. These two populations also metabolized mesotrione 2-fold faster than sensitive populations, PPI1 and PPI2, and rapidly formed 4-OH-mesotrione. Additionally, SYNR1 and SYNR2 formed 5-OH-mesotrione, which is not produced in high abundance in waterhemp or naturally tolerant maize. Metabolite features derived from 4/5-OH-mesotrione and potential Phase II mesotrione-conjugates were detected and characterized by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS).",

      "abstract": "Palmer amaranth has evolved target and nontarget site resistance to protoporphyrinogen oxidase-inhibitor herbicides in the United States. Recently, a population (KCTR) from a long-term conservation tillage study in Kansas was found to be resistant to herbicides from six sites of action, including to PPO-inhibitors, even with this herbicide group being minimally used in this field. This research investigated the level of resistance to postemergence PPO-inhibitors, target- and nontarget-site resistance mechanism(s), and efficacy of pre-emergence chemistries. The greenhouse experiments confirmed 6.1- to 78.9-fold resistance to lactofen in KCTR, with the level of resistance increasing when KCTR was purified for the resistance trait. PPO2 sequences alignment revealed the absence of known mutations conferring resistance to PPO-inhibitors in KCTR Palmer amaranth, and differential expression of the PPO2 gene did not occur. KCTR metabolized fomesafen faster than the susceptible population, indicating that herbicide detoxification is the mechanism conferring resistance in this population. Further, treatment with the cytochrome P450-inhibitor malathion followed by lactofen restored the sensitivity of KCTR to this herbicide. Despite being resistant to POST applied PPO-inhibitors, KCTR Palmer amaranth was completely controlled by the labeled rate of the PRE applied PPO-inhibitors fomesafen, flumioxazin, saflufenacil, sulfentrazone, and oxadiazon. The overall results suggest that P450-mediated metabolism confers resistance to PPO-inhibitors in KCTR, rather than alterations in the PPO2, which were more commonly found in other Palmer amaranth populations. Future work will focus on identifying the fomesafen metabolites and on unravelling the genetic basis of metabolic resistance to PPO-inhibitor herbicides in KCTR Palmer amaranth.",

Urea and nitrate were used to compare for their effects on the remobilization of stabilized Cd in the rhizosphere soil of edible amaranth at nitrogen concentrations of 60, 95, and 130 mg kg-1. The results showed that compared to nitrate nitrogen, the Cd content in shoots increased by 76.2%, 65.6%, and 148% after applying three different concentrations of urea, and the total remobilization amount of Cd also increased by 16.0%, 24.9%, and 14.0% respectively. Urea application promotes root secretion of citric acid, malic acid, pyruvate, and γ-aminobutyric acid, crucial in remobilizing stable Cd. The application of urea promoted the expression of genes involved in sucrose transport, glycolysis, the TCA cycle, amino acid secretion, citric acid efflux, and proton efflux. Arabidopsis heterologous expression and yeast one-hybrid assays identify critical roles of AmMATE42 and AmMATE43 in citric acid and fumaric acid efflux, with AmSTOP1 activating their transcription. Inhibition of SIZ1 expression in urea treatment reduce AmSTOP1 SUMOylation, leading to increased expression of AmMATE42 and AmMATE43 and enhanced organic acids efflux. Using edible amaranth as a model vegetable, we discovered that urea is not beneficial to preserving the sustainability of stabilized Cd during the reuse of remediated farmlands contaminated with Cd.",

The photocatalyst was comprehensively characterized and analyzed while its efficacy in photocatalytic degradation of amaranth (AR) under various lighting conditions was investigated, and the catalytic mechanism was determined by kinetic analysis and free radical scavenging experiments. The results showed that g-C3N4 formed a strong bond with BiOI. The resulting composite catalyst retains the inherent 2D lamellar structure of g-C3N4, as well as the 3D microsphere structure of BiOI, thereby creating heterojunctions via p-n interactions. Under visible light exposure, g-C3N4/BiOI-15% demonstrated optimal catalytic performance, achieving a degradation rate of 74.64% for AR and exhibiting the highest rate constant. Radical tests confirmed that -O2- (superoxide anion) plays a crucial role as active species in the photocatalytic reaction."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: WRKY TFs (WRKY transcription factors) contribute to the synthesis of secondary metabolites in plants. Betalains are natural pigments that do not coexist with anthocyanins within the same plant. Amaranthus tricolor ('Suxian No.1') is an important leaf vegetable rich in betalains. However, the WRKY family members in amaranth and their roles in betalain synthesis and metabolism are still unclear. METHODS: To elucidate the molecular characteristics of the amaranth WRKY gene family and its role in betalain synthesis, WRKY gene family members were screened and identified using amaranth transcriptome data, and their physicochemical properties, conserved domains, phylogenetic relationships, and conserved motifs were analyzed using bioinformatics methods. RESULTS: In total, 72 WRKY family members were identified from the amaranth transcriptome. Three WRKY genes involved in betalain synthesis were screened in the phylogenetic analysis of WRKY TFs. RT-qPCR showed that the expression levels of these three genes in red amaranth 'Suxian No.1' were higher than those in green amaranth 'Suxian No.2' and also showed that the expression level of AtrWRKY42 gene short-spliced transcript AtrWRKY42-2 in Amaranth 'Suxian No.1' was higher than that of the complete sequence AtrWRKY42-1, so the short-spliced transcript AtrWRKY42-2 was mainly expressed in 'Suxian No.2' amaranth. Moreover, the total expression levels of AtrWRKY42-1 and AtrWRKY42-2 were down-regulated after GA3 treatment, so AtrWRKY42-2 was identified as a candidate gene. Therefore, the short splice variant AtrWRKY42-2 cDNA sequence, gDNA sequence, and promoter sequence of AtrWRKY42 were cloned, and the PRI 101-AN-AtrWRKY42-2-EGFP vector was constructed to evaluate subcellular localization, revealing that AtrWRKY42-2 is located in the nucleus. The overexpression vector pRI 101-AN-AtrWRKY42-2-EGFP and VIGS (virus-induced gene silencing) vector pTRV2-AtrWRKY42-2 were transferred into leaves of 'Suxian No.1' by an Agrobacterium-mediated method. The results showed that AtrWRKY42-2 overexpression could promote the expression of AtrCYP76AD1 and increase betalain synthesis. A yeast one-hybrid assay demonstrated that AtrWRKY42-2 could bind to the AtrCYP76AD1 promoter to regulate betalain synthesis. DISCUSSION: This study lays a foundation for further exploring the function of AtrWRKY42-2 in betalain metabolism."

      "abstract": "Exploring alternative fertilizers is crucial in agriculture due to the cost and environmental impact of inorganic options. This study investigated the potential of sewage-derived biofertilizers on the growth and physiology of Amaranthus cruentus plants. Various treatments were compared, including control treatments with inorganic fertilizer and treatments with biofertilizers composed of microalgae, biosolids and reclaimed water. The following traits were investigated: photosynthetic pigments, gas exchange, growth, and leaf nutrient concentrations. The results showed that the concentrations of N, P, Cu, Fe Zn and Na nutrients, in the dry microalgae and biosolids, were quite high for the needs of the plants. The wet microalgae presented high concentration of Cu, Fe and Zn nutrients while reclaimed water contained high concentration of N, K, Ca and S. Na and Zn nutrients increased in the leaf of plants treated with dry microalgae and biosolid, respectively. At the beginning of the flowering phase, total chlorophyll and carotenoids contents were lower for plants grown with wet microalgae while for plants grown with higher doses of biosolid or reclaimed water total chlorophyll was increased, and carotenoids were not affected. Lower photosynthetic pigments under wet microalgae resulted in lower photosynthetic rates. On the other hand, amendments with dry microalgae and biosolid increased photosynthetic rates with the biosolid being the most effective. Higher applications of biosolid, wet and dry microalgae produced a considerable increase in shoot biomass of amaranth, with the dry microalgae being the most effective. Additionally, reclaimed water obtained after tertiary treatment of sewage with microalgae and biosolids applied alone showed promising effects on plant growth. Overall, these findings suggest that organic fertilizers derived from sewage treatment have the potential to enhance plant growth and contribute to sustainable agricultural practices.",

METHODS: A total of 45 healthy Holstein cows with same parity and similar milk yield and body weight were randomly divided into 3 groups: control diet without amaranth hay (CON) or 50% and 100% alfalfa hay replaced by an equal amount of amaranth hay (dry matter basis, AH1 and AH2, respectively). All the cows were fed regularly 3 times a day at 06:30, 14:30, and 22:30 and had free access to water. The experiment lasted for 60 d. RESULTS: The dry matter intake of CON and AH1 groups was higher (p<0.05) than that of AH2 group. Compared with AH1 group, the milk yield of AH2 group was reduced (p<0.05). Moreover, dietary substitution of alfalfa hay by amaranth hay increased (p<0.05) milk fat, ammonia nitrogen and acetate concentrations. However, the crude protein digestibility of AH2 group was lower (p<0.05) than that of CON group, while an opposite tendency of serum urea nitrogen was found between two groups. The neutral detergent fiber digestibility of AH1 group was increased (p<0.05) when compared to AH2 group. Amaranth hay treatment increased (p<0.05) the serum concentration of glutathione peroxidase in dairy cows. Compared with CON group, the malonaldehyde activity of AH1 group was decreased (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Dietary replacing alfalfa hay with amaranth hay (50% ratio) in dairy cows did not affect production performance but improved their antioxidant ability."

The SGID produced increased ORAC activity for both samples, with some differences in the ORAC of the whole digests BD and FD and of some gel filtration fractions.

BDdbs presented a greater ORAC potency (IC50: 0.05 ± 0.01 and 0.008 ± 0.004 mg protein/ml for FDdbs and BDdbs, respectively). These fractions showed low cytotoxicity values (measured by LDH release) and produced high intracellular ROS inhibition (around 80 %), increased the SOD activity and the GSH content, with no effect on GPx activity in Caco2-TC7 cells exposed to H2O2.

      "abstract": "Amaranth (Amaranthus L.), like other pseudocereals as quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.), chia (Salvia hispanica L.) and buckwheat (Fagopyrum sp.), is a promising source of dietary protein. Depending on the subspecies and breeds of amaranth, the protein content in its grain is estimated from 13.1 to 21.5%, and its amino acid score varies over a significant range and can be limited. The aim of this study was to obtain a protein concentrate from amaranth (Amaranthus L.) grain of the Voronezh breed, enrich it with chicken egg protein, determine the amino acid score of the obtained protein module, and experimentally evaluate in vivo its true digestibility and biological value. Material and methods. The amaranth protein concentrate was obtained from grain according to the technological scheme, including its enzymatic treatment, alkaline extraction, acid precipitation of proteins, microfiltration and lyophilization. The amino acid composition and amino acid score of the concentrate were determined. The protein module was obtained by mixing amaranth protein concentrate and chicken egg protein in a weight ratio of 58:42. The true digestibility and biological value of the protein module has been determined in vivo. The experiment was carried out on 32 Wistar male rats divided into 2 groups (n=16 rats): control group 1 with a body weight of 118.7±3.1 g and experimental group 2 with a body weight of 119.5±3.0 g. Animals of groups 1 and 2 received diets in which egg protein and a protein module were used as a protein source, respectively. Within 15 days of the experiment, individual indicators of food intake and body weight gain of each animal were determined. From the 14th to the 15th day food intake was determined and feces were collected. The amount of nitrogen in the food and feces was determined for each rat using the Kjeldahl method. The true digestibility of the protein was determined according to obtained data. Results. The resulting amaranth protein concentrate contained 70.4±0.6% of protein, 17.0±1.0% fat, 9.8±0.8% carbohydrates, 1.8±0.2% ash, its moisture content was 1.4±0.1%. There were no significant differences in food intake and body weight gain between animals of both groups. The calculated value of the true digestibility of chicken egg protein was 98.8±0.1% for the control group 1, of the protein module was 99.0±0.1% for the experimental group 2, the differences between the groups were not significant. Conclusion. The results of amino acid analysis and the in vivo study of the true digestibility of the protein module (composition amaranth protein/chicken egg protein) indicate the absence of limitation relative to the amino acid scale of the \"ideal\" protein (FAO/WHO, 2007) and high true digestibility. The biological value of the protein module, calculated according to PDCAAS, is 99.0±0.1%, which confirms the prospects for its inclusion in specialized foods.",

In SnP@ZnO, SnP and ZnO are likely held together by a coordinative interaction between the pyridyl N atoms of SnP and the Zn atoms on the surface of ZnO. In the case of SnP/AA@ZnO, the SnP centers were robustly coupled with ZnO nanoparticles through the AA anchors. SnP/AA@ZnO exhibited largely enhanced photocatalytic activities for the degradation of anionic amaranth (AM) dye under a visible light irradiation, compared to SnP, ZnO, and SnP@ZnO. The degradation efficiency of AM by SnP/AA@ZnO was 95% within 60 min at a rate constant of 0.048 min-1. The remarkable photocatalytic oxidation performance of SnP/AA@ZnO was mainly attributed to the synergistic effect between SnP and ZnO. This study is valuable for the development of highly effective composite photocatalytic systems in advanced oxidation processes and is of importance for the treatment of wastewater containing dyes."

      "abstract": "In this study, decolorized pectic polysaccharides (D-ACLP) with molecular weight (Mw) distribution of 3483- 2,023,656 Da were prepared from Amaranth caudatus leaves. Purified polysaccharides (P-ACLP) with the Mw of 152,955 Da were further isolated from D-ACLP through gel filtration. The structure of P-ACLP was analyzed by 1D and 2D NMR spectra. P-ACLP were identified as rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) containing dimeric arabinose side chains. The main chain of P-ACLP was composed of →4)-α-GalpA-(1→, →2)-β-Rhap-(1→, →3)-β-Galp-(1→ and →6)-β-Galp-(1→. There was a branched chain of α-Araf-(1→2)-α-Araf-(1→ connected to the O-6 position of →3)-β-Galp-(1→. The GalpA residues were partially methyl esterified at O-6 and acetylated at O-3. The 28-day consecutive gavage of D-ALCP (400 mg/kg) significantly elevated the hippocampal glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels in rats. The concentrations of butyric acid and total short chain fatty acids in the cecum contents also increased significantly. Moreover, D-ACLP could significantly increase the gut microbiota diversity and dramatically up-regulated the abundance of Actinobacteriota (phylum) and unclassified Oscillospiraceae (genus) in intestinal bacteria. Taking together, D-ACLP might promote the hippocampal GLP-1 level through the beneficial regulation of butyric acid-producing bacteria in gut microbiota. This study contributed to making full use of Amaranth caudatus leaves for cognitive dysfunction intervention in food industry.",

      "abstract": "The textile industry generates significant amounts of wastewater containing high concentrations of azo dyes. An important point in the process of purification of azo dyes is their influence on the activated sludge (AS) in wastewater treatment plants. Azo dyes, such as amaranth, play the role of xenobiotics. This article seeks to answer the question of how organisms manage to respond to xenobiotics remains very important and open, i.e., how they will react to toxic conditions. The aim of this research was to study how these changes are expressed in terms of the different trophic levels of AS. In our experiment, it was found that the dominant trophic units are significantly changed due to the xenobiotic entering the system. The data reveal the significant development of the bacterial segment (genus Pseudomonas and azo-degrading bacteria) at times of large amaranth removal. In the most active phase of amaranth biodetoxification (48 h), the culturable bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas change by about 40%, while the azo-degrading bacteria change by about 2%. Fauna organisms have a sharp change in the dominant groups-from attached and crawling ciliates and testate amoebas to the mass development of small and large flagellates. This is of great importance because micro- and metafauna play an important role in the detoxification process by ingesting some of the xenobiotics. This role is expressed in the fact that after dying, macro-organisms release this xenobiotic in small portions so that it can then be effectively degraded by adapting to the amaranth biodegradation bacteria. In this study, it is clear that all these events lead to a decline in the quality of AS. But on the other hand, these allow AS to survive as a microbial community, and the fauna segment does not disappear completely.",

This study investigated the metabolic effects of malathion (cytochrome P450 inhibitor) and 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan [NBD-Cl; glutathione S-transferase inhibitor] on the S-metolachlor-resistant A. palmeri biotype. Root elongation of the resistant biotype was 20% more inhibited by treatment of NBD-Cl (50 nM) and S-metolachlor (2 μM) in mixture than by treatment of S-metolachlor alone. Metabolites of S-metolachlor were 1.4-12.1 times greater produced in the resistant biotype for 7 d than in the susceptible standard. Production of cerotic acid, one of the very-long-chain fatty acids containing 26 carbons, was more reduced in the susceptible standard (3.8-fold) than in the resistant biotype (1.8-fold) by S-metolachlor treatment. Conclusively, evolution of S-metolachlor resistance observed in this study was likely associated with improved activity of glutathione S-transferases. Further studies are needed to genetically evaluate plant endogenous enzymes involving cerotic acid production."

Pest management has been restricted to indiscriminate application of insecticides to foliage. Applying systemic insecticides to seeds has been shown to manage aphid infestations in other crop systems. We evaluated two commercially available seed treatments in East Africa, Apron Star (thiamethoxam 20 g/kg + metalaxyl-M 20 g/kg + difenoconazole 2 g/kg) and Menceron (imidacloprid 233 g/L + pencycuron 50 g/L + thiram 107 g/L) for their efficacy against M. persicae and impact on fresh leaf yield with two Amaranthus species, Amaranthus blitum (2 selections), Amaranthus hybridus (4 selections) and untreated control. Two storage periods (24 h and 3 months) with seed treatments were used. Each amaranth selection was treated individually with Apron and Monceren or untreated, and seeds were planted either 24 h or 3 months after treatment. Significant reduction in live aphids was observed with A. blitum and A. hybridus selections grown with seed treatment, at 6, 8 and 10 d after infestation (DAI) when compared with seeds grown without seed treatment. Untreated seeds of A. hybridus (selection 5) had significantly higher number of live aphids up to 243, greater percentage of damaged leaves and leaf damage score up to 84% and 64% respectively when compared with treated seeds of specific amaranth at 10 DAI. No significant difference was noted between seed treatment and storage time. Amaranth seeds treated with Monceren offered more protection against infestations of Myzus persicae than amaranth seeds treated with Apron under high tunnel experiments.",

      "abstract": "Sprouts, mainly from cereals, legumes, and some pseudo-cereals, are rich in nutrients and contain biocompounds, making them attractive for consumption. This research study aimed to develop treatments with UV-C light in soybean and amaranth sprouts and evaluate their effect on biocompounds content, compared with chlorine treatments. UV-C treatments were applied at distances of 3 and 5 cm and times of 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 min, whereas chlorine treatments were applied as immersion in solutions at 100 and 200 ppm for 15 min. Phenolics and flavonoid content were higher in UV-C-treated sprouts than in those treated with chlorine solutions. Ten biocompounds were identified in soybean sprouts, with increasing in apigenin C-glucoside-rhamnoside (105%), apigenin 7-O-glucosylglucoside (237%), and apigenin C-glucoside malonylated (70%) due to UV-C application (3 cm, 15 min); for amaranth sprouts, five biocompounds were identified, with higher contents of p-coumaroylquinic acid (17.7%) after UV-C treatment (3 cm, 15 min). The best treatment to achieve the highest bioactive compounds concentration was UV-C at a distance of 3 cm for 15 min, without significant modification on the color parameters, Hue and chroma. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: UV-C can be used to increase the biocompound content in amaranth and soybean sprouts. Nowadays, there is UV-C equipment available for industrial applications. In this way, sprouts may be maintained as fresh through this physical technology, and they will retain or increase the concentration of health-related compounds.",

      "abstract": "Dyes are highly toxic and persistent in the environment. Their presence in water causes environmental and social problems. Dyes must be effectively removed from the water. A UV/ZVI/H2O2 process was applied to decompose two organic dyes, AM E123 and AM ACID. A commercial ZVI product, Ferox Flow, was used, and its properties were determined using SEM and XRF. The zeta potential, surface area, and optical properties of ZVI were also determined. The efficiency of dye removal in optimal conditions was 85.5% and 80.85% for AM E123 and AM ACID, respectively. Complete decolorization was observed in all samples. The decomposition of both dyes occurred according to a modified pseudo-second-order reaction and there was a statistically significant correlation between the TOC decrease, pH, and process time. The catalyst was observed to have high stability, and this was not affected by the performance of the treatment process even after the third cycle, as confirmed by the results of the catalyst surface analysis and iron diffusion test. Slight differences in process efficiency were observed after each cycle. The need for only a small amount of catalyst to decompose AM E123 and AM ACID, coupled with the ability to reuse the catalyst without the need for prior preparation, may reduce catalyst purchase costs."

      "abstract": "The contamination of water is increasing day by day due to the increase of urbanization and population. Textile industries contribute to this by discarding their waste directly into water streams without proper treatment. A recent study explores the treatment potential of copper oxide nanorods (CuO NRs) synthesized on a green basis in the presence of a biopolymer matrix of agar (AA) and alginate (Alg), in terms of cost effectiveness and environmental impact. The synthesized bio nanocomposite (BNC) was characterized by using different instrumental techniques such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), ultra-violet spectroscopy (UV-Vis), scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray-elemental analysis (SEM-EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area diffraction pattern (SAED) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The optical studies revealed that immobilization of CuO NRs with Alg-Agar biopolymer blend resulted in an increase in light absorption capacity by decreasing the energy bandgap from 2.53 eV to 2.37 eV. The bio nanocomposite was utilized as a photocatalyst for the degradation of amaranth (AN) dye from an aquatic environment under visible light irradiation. A statistical tool known as central composite design (CCD) associated with response surface methodology (RSM) was taken into consideration to evaluate the optimized values of process variables and their synergistic effect on photocatalytic efficiency. The optimized values of process variables were found to be irradiation time (45 min), AN concentration (80 ppm), catalyst dose (20 mg), and pH (4), resulting in 95.69% of dye degradation at 95% confidence level with desirability level 1. The rate of AN degradation was best defined by pseudo-first-order reaction based on the correlation coefficient value (R2 = 0.99) suggesting the establishment of adsorption-desorption equilibrium initially at the catalyst surface then photogenerated •O2- radicals interacting with AN molecule to mineralize them into small non-toxic entities like CO2, H2O. The material used has high efficiency and stability in photocatalytic degradation experiments up to four cycles of reusability."

Currently, it is still unknown the phytotoxicity effect of MPs on amaranth (Amaranthus mangostanus L.). This study investigated the early responses of amaranth by exposing its seeds to suspensions of polystyrene (PS), polyethylene (PE), and polypropylene (PP) MPs. We observed the effects of MPs on seed germination and growth of amaranth, especially on the oxidative damage in amaranth roots. Impacts of MPs on the germination and growth of amaranth varied with the type, concentration, and particle size of MPs. PE MPs and PP MPs inhibited the shoot extension of amaranth, while the root length under PP MPs treatment was generally shorter than that under PS MPs and PE MPs. The accumulation of H2O2 in amaranth roots increased with the rising of MPs concentration. Compared with the control, a little number of dead cells were found in the roots of amaranth under high MPs treatment. It is noteworthy that only under 100 mg/L PP treatment, the amaranthus seedlings root cells were disorganized, due to the reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage in the roots. These findings provide essential information to assess the phytotoxicity of MPs in agricultural products, and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of the observed phytotoxicity.",

The PFC-PEF hybrid system was interconnected by a circuit attached to the electrodes in PFC and PEF. Circuit connection is the principal channel for the electron transfer and mobility between PFC and PEF. Thus, different circuit connections were evaluated in the hybrid system for their influences on the Amaranth dye degradation. The PFC-PEF system under the complete circuit connection condition attained the highest decolourization efficiency of Amaranth (PFC: 98.85%; PEF: 95.69%), which indicated that the complete circuit connection was crucial for in-situ formation of reactive species in dye degradation. Besides, the pivotal role of ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation in the PFC-PEF system for both dye degradation and electricity generation was revealed through various UV light-illuminating conditions applied for PFC and PEF. A remarkable influence of UV light irradiation on the production of hydrogen peroxide and generation and regeneration of Fe2+ in PEF was demonstrated. This study provided a comprehensive mechanistic insight into the dye degradation and electricity generation by the PFC-PEF system.",

The suspensions were hydrothermally treated at 20, 50, and 80°C for 1, 5, and 24 h. The blends were treated at 80°C for 1 h. The effect of hydrothermal treatments of the suspensions on their morphological (color, SEM), water-binding, and rheological-functional properties was studied. The puffed amaranth suspensions exhibited cold swelling properties by rapid viscosity increase and significant water absorption properties. It was found that hydrothermal treatment at 80°C for 1 h significantly increased water absorption and viscosity in puffed and raw flour suspensions. However, the puffed suspensions showed significantly higher values in water binding and viscosity. Suspensions of raw amaranth flour showed increasing color differences with increasing temperature. Blends of raw and puffed amaranth flour resulted in a decreasing color change with increasing puffed flour content. Water absorption of the samples increased with an increasing puffed flour content. Raw amaranth flour and the 50/50 (puffed/raw) blend had the lowest, 10/90 and 20/80 (puffed/raw), and showed similar viscosity profiles to suspensions of pure puffed flour."

Tumors were induced by transplanting melanoma B16-F10 cells into the mice. The most effective treatments were those including UM + LunLip, with no difference between the lunasin concentrations (15 or 30 mg/kg body weight); however, these treatments were statistically different from the tumor-bearing untreated control (G3) (p < 0.05). The groups treated with topical application showed significant inhibition (68%, p < 0.05) compared to G3. The groups treated with subcutaneous injections showed significant inhibition (up to 99%, p < 0.05) in G3. During tumor development, UM + LunLip treatments under-expressed Ki-67 (0.2-fold compared to G3), glycogen synthase kinase-3β (0.1-fold compared to G3), and overexpressed caspase-3 (30-fold compared to G3). In addition, larger tumors showed larger necrotic areas (38% with respect to the total tumor) (p < 0.0001). In conclusion, the UM + LunLip treatment was effective when applied either subcutaneously or topically in the melanoma tumor-developing groups, as it slowed down cell proliferation and activated apoptosis."

      "abstract": "The micro and nano bubble (MNB) technology, due to its promising features and advantages, has become increasingly popular in agriculture. MNB-treated water positively impacts plant growth, especially when it is treated with a combination of gas-like carbon dioxide (CO2), injected through the MNB generator. Therefore, this study used MNB water with CO2 that are small bubbles of nanometer and micrometer diameters having several unique physical properties that make them useful for water treatments. This research evaluates the effect of MNBs and CO2-treated water on leafy vegetable Amaranth green (Amaranthus viridis). The experiment divided the Amaranth plants into three major groups, G1, G2, and G3, irrigated by MNB water with dissolved CO2, MNBs with only Air, and simple tap water, respectively. The first treatment group (G1) (MNBs with CO2) was further divided into three sub-divisions, i.e., G1A, G1B, G1C, and the second treatment group G2 (MNBs with Air) was divided into three sub-groups, i.e., G2A, G2B, and G2C, while the third group G3 with only one category as only controlled group. These sub-divisions of treatment groups G1 and G2 were done to investigate the impact of MNBs and CO2 treated water with different time durations. For example, in G1A, the water treatment with MNBs and CO2 was kept five minutes, for G1B 10 minutes, and G1C 15 minutes. Similar method was adopted for G2 as well. According to the results, water treated with MNB and CO2 has a significant (90%) impact on the Amaranth germination rate and plant growth. Specifically, pots irrigated with the MNBs + CO2-treated water showed better germination and plant growth rate than the MNBs + Air treated water. Overall, both treatment groups, G1 and G2, showed significantly higher impacts than the CK groups (simple water). Further, this experiment showed that the 10 and 15 minutes treatment of water (G1B, G1C and G2B, G2C) increased the stem height and root size compared to the 5 minutes treated water (G1A, G2A). This study concludes that the water with MNBs has a positive impact on the vegetables and can be an effective technology to improve crop yield.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus affects different age groups, and it is popularly managed using synthetic drugs; however, recent research efforts focus on dietary intervention especially the use of fiber rich crops to circumvent the effects of drugs. Developed shallot-enriched amaranth-based extruded snacks, namely: GCB, Amaranth: shallot: soy cake (55:25:20) %; TYD, Amaranth: shallot: soy cake (75:14.81:10.19)%; DZU, Amaranth: shallot: soy cake (60.43:25:14.57)%; and JKL, Amaranth: shallot: soy cake (70:25:5)%, were evaluated for proximate composition, total phenol and flavonoid contents. Snacks ability to modulate carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzymes in streptozotocin induced diabetic rats were also investigated. AMT (100% amaranth grain extrudate) and CCS (commercial shallot-enriched snack) served as control. Protein contents of snacks provided up to 25% of daily protein requirements for adult. Snacks exhibited high total phenol and flavonoid contents. Animals fed with snacks showed ameliorative effects on hematological parameters, attenuates elevation of enzyme activities in kidney and liver homogenates, and displayed decreased α-glucosidase/α-amylase activities. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Dietary intervention is capable of circumventing the adverse effects of synthetic drugs in the management of diabetes mellitus. The study established that developed shallot-enriched amaranth-based extruded snacks possess significant ability to hamper the activities of key carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzymes in streptozotocin induced diabetic rats, hence, has potential as a functional nutritious snack to curtail hyperglycemia and prevent diabetic complications.",

      "abstract": "It is well known that rapeseed oil improves lipid profile and has antiatherosclerotic properties. Recently, amaranth oil has also become popular due to its potential health benefits. However, the effect of this oil on atherosclerosis markers in humans is not clear. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effect of amaranth and rapeseed oils on selected atherosclerosis-related parameters in overweight and obese subjects. In this randomized cross-over study, 44 subjects were instructed to consume 20 mL of amaranth oil and rapeseed oil during two consecutive three-week intervention periods separated by a washout period of the same duration as the intervention. The outcome variables included changes in tumor necrosis factor-alpha, adiponectin, oxidized low-density lipoprotein, apolipoproteins (Apo) A1, B and E as well as glucose and insulin homeostasis markers. Compared to rapeseed oil, amaranth oil had a slight positive effect on adiponectin levels (mean (95% confidence interval): 0.55 (0.22-0.89) vs. -0.29 (-0.75-0.16), p = 0.0002) but negatively affected ApoB concentrations (0.05 (-0.01-0.11) vs. 0.03 (-0.07-0.00), p = 0.0004) and ApoB/A1 ratio (0.01 (-0.03-0.05) vs. -0.02 (-0.04-0.00), p = 0.0113). No differences between the other analyzed parameters were observed. In conclusion, amaranth oil does not have a greater beneficial effect on atherosclerosis markers than rapeseed oil. However, further studies with a longer intervention period are needed. The study was retrospectively registered with the German Clinical Trials Register within the number: DRKS00014046, date of registration: 3 May 2018.",

The experiments were conducted using a central composite design (CCD) with the inputs of solution pH (X1: 2.0-10), adsorbent mass (X4: 4-20 mg), AM concentration (X2: 10-50 mg L-1), BB FCF concentration (X3: 10-50 mg L-1), and sonication time (X5: 2-12 min). At the optimum conditions, the removal percentages of 99.30% and 98.50% were obtained for AM and BB FCF, respectively. The adsorption of the dyes was described by Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order (PSO) kinetic models. The maximum adsorption capacities of AM and BB FCF were 174.8 mg g-1 and 166.7 mg g-1, respectively. The adsorption thermodynamic study showed that the adsorption of the dyes occurred endothermically and spontaneously. The removal percentages of AM and BB FCF from the real samples were in the range of 94.52-99.65% for the binary solutions. The removal percentage for each dye after five cycles of adsorption/desorption was > 90%. This work provides a useful insight to the potential application of CNTs-based magnetic nanocomposite for the treatment of wastewaters contaminated with dyes.",

Phytochemical profile of this aqueous extract was analyzed. HLE-B3 cells were pretreated by this aqueous extract at 0.25%, 0.5%, or 1%, and followed by high glucose treatment. Results showed that the content of phenolic acids, flavonoids, anthocyanins, carotenoids, and triterpenoids in this aqueous extract was in the range of 1,107-2,861 mg/100 g dry weight. High glucose decreased cells viability and suppressed Bcl-2 mRNA expression. This aqueous extract pretreatments raised 11-42% cell survival and upregulated 20-47% Bcl-2 mRNA expression. High glucose reduced Na+ -K+ ATPase activity and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). This aqueous extract raised 27-40% Na+ -K+ ATPase activity, and 18-51% MMP. High glucose stimulated the generation of total advanced glycative endproducts (AGEs), methylglyoxal, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). This aqueous extract pretreatments lowered total AGEs, methylglyoxal, and ROS levels in the range of 0.38-1.17 folds, 1.7-4.9 nmol/mg protein, and 0.35-1.06 relative fluorescence unit/mg protein. High glucose upregulated mRNA expression of aldose reductase, nuclear factor kappa B, and p38. This aqueous extract pretreatments decreased mRNA expression of these factors in the range of 75-159%, 57-151%, and 54-166%. High glucose downregulated mRNA expression of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). This aqueous extract pretreatments increased 12-38% Nrf2 mRNA expression.

      "abstract": "The non-judicious use of herbicides has led to a widespread evolution of herbicide resistance in various weed species including Palmer amaranth, one of the most aggressive and troublesome weeds in the United States. Early detection of herbicide resistance in weed populations may help growers devise alternative management strategies before resistance spreads throughout the field. In this study, Raman spectroscopy was utilized as a rapid, non-destructive diagnostic tool to distinguish between three different glyphosate-resistant and four -susceptible Palmer amaranth populations. The glyphosate-resistant populations used in this study were 11-, 32-, and 36-fold more resistant compared to the susceptible standard. The 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) gene copy number for these resistant populations ranged from 86 to 116. We found that Raman spectroscopy could be used to differentiate herbicide-treated and non-treated susceptible populations based on changes in the intensity of vibrational bands at 1156, 1186, and 1525 cm-1 that originate from carotenoids. The partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model indicated that within 1 day of glyphosate treatment (D1), the average accuracy of detecting herbicide-treated and non-treated susceptible populations was 90 and 73.3%, respectively. We also found that glyphosate-resistant and -susceptible populations of Palmer amaranth can be easily detected with an accuracy of 84.7 and 71.9%, respectively, as early as D1. There were relative differences in the concentration of carotenoids in plants with different resistance levels, but these changes were not significant. The results of the study illustrate the utility of Raman spectra for evaluation of herbicide resistance and stress response in plants under field conditions."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The production of sufficient animal feed in arid and semi-arid regions plays a significant role in food security in these areas. The present study was conducted based on the hypothesis that intercropping of sorghum and amaranth, comprising relatively drought tolerant forages, will enhance the yield and quality of the feed under limited irrigation water availability. RESULTS: Implementation of fixed alternate furrow irrigation (FFI) and alternate furrow irrigation (AFI) resulted in a saving of 22.5% and 19.7% of irrigation water, respectively. However, the water saving declined both yield and quality of forage. In conventional furrow irrigation (CFI), the highest dry matter (DM) yield was 15.5 Mg  ha-1 , obtained from S50 -A50 treatment. In FFI and AFI, sole sorghum produced the highest DM. However, their maximum yields (11.2 and 12.6 Mg ha-1 , respectively) were not significantly different from yields in S75 -A25 intercropping ratios. Irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) was similar in CFI and AFI and considerably higher than FFI. Sorghum monoculture and the S75 -A25 intercropping had the highest IWUE (3.4 and 3.3 kg m-3 ), whereas IWUE of the sole amaranth was 1.7 kg m-3 . The partial land equivalent ratio and monetary advantage index of amaranth and sorghum indicated that sorghum would benefit from intercropping as long as its ratio in the intercropping is more than 25%. CONCLUSION: When sufficient irrigation is available, intercropping of sorghum and amaranth can considerably improve yield and quality of emergency feed. However, the benefits from intercropping faded under the two partial root-zone irrigation methods used in the present study. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "Herbicides are major tools for effective weed management. The evolution of resistance to herbicides in weedy species, especially contributed by non-target-site-based resistance (NTSR) is a worrisome issue in crop production globally. Glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) is one of the extremely difficult weeds in southern US crop production. In this study, we present the level and molecular basis of resistance to the chloroacetamide herbicide, S-metolachlor, in six field-evolved A. palmeri populations that had survivors at the recommended field-dose (1.1 kg ai ha-1). These samples were collected in 2014 and 2015. The level of resistance was determined in dose-response assays. The effective dose for 50% control (ED50) of the susceptible population was 27 g ai ha-1, whereas the ED50 of the resistant populations ranged from 88 to 785 g ai ha-1. Therefore, A. palmeri resistance to S-metolachlor evolved in Arkansas as early as 2014. Metabolic-inhibitor and molecular assays indicated NTSR in these populations, mainly driven by GSTs. To understand the mechanism of resistance, selected candidate genes were analyzed in leaves and roots of survivors (with 1 × S-metolachlor). Expression analysis of the candidate genes showed that the primary site of S-metolachlor detoxification in A. palmeri is in the roots. Two GST genes, ApGSTU19 and ApGSTF8 were constitutively highly expressed in roots of all plants across all resistant populations tested. The expression of both GSTs increased further in survivors after treatment with S-metolachlor. The induction level of ApGSTF2 and ApGSTF2like by S-metolachlor differed among resistant populations. Overall, higher expression of ApGSTU19, ApGSTF8, ApGSTF2, and ApGSTF2like, which would lead to higher GST activity in roots, was strongly associated with the resistant phenotype. Phylogenetic relationship and analysis of substrate binding site of candidate genes suggested functional similarities with known metolachlor-detoxifying GSTs, effecting metabolic resistance to S-metolachlor in A. palmeri. Resistance is achieved by elevated baseline expression of these genes and further induction by S-metolachlor in resistant plants."

      "abstract": "Evolution of multiple herbicide resistance in Palmer amaranth across the United States is a serious challenge for its management. Recently, a Palmer amaranth population (KCTR; Kansas Conservation Tillage Resistant) from a long-term conservation tillage research project in Kansas, United States, was found uncontrolled by several commonly used herbicides. Importantly, this field did not have a history of repeated use of some of the herbicides for which the KCTR Palmer amaranth population showed lack of control. The objectives of this study were to confirm the evolution of multiple resistances and determine possible mechanism(s) of resistance in KCTR Palmer amaranth plants. In response to post-emergence application, 28-100% of KCTR Palmer amaranth survived field recommended rates of 2,4-D, ALS-, PS II-, EPSPS-, PPO-, HPPD-inhibitor herbicides, or tank- or pre-mixture of PS II- and HPPD-inhibitor herbicides, confirming evolution of six-way resistance in this Palmer amaranth population. However, this population was found susceptible to the PS I- and glutamine synthetase inhibitor herbicides. Chlorsulfuron-, imazethapyr-, and atrazine-resistant plants did not show any previously reported mutation in ALS and psbA genes, the target sites of these herbicides, respectively. However, the survivors of glyphosate treatment showed amplification of EPSPS gene (up to 88 copies). The KCTR plants pretreated with cytochrome P450 or GST inhibitors along with atrazine, 2,4-D, lactofen, or mesotrione had significantly less biomass accumulation than those treated with herbicides alone. Plants treated with P450 inhibitor followed by imazethapyr showed moderate reduction of biomass in KCTR which was statistically similar to a susceptible Palmer amaranth population treated with imazethapyr. These results suggest predominance of metabolic resistance possibly mediated by cytochrome P450 and GST enzyme activity that may have predisposed the KCTR Palmer amaranth population to evolve resistance to multiple herbicides. This is the first report of evolution of six-way resistance in a single Palmer amaranth population. Appropriate management strategies, including integration of cultural, and mechanical, and herbicide mixtures, are warranted to control such Palmer amaranth populations."

      "abstract": "This study evaluated the effect on Wistar rat's oxidative status of incorporating amaranth flour (AF) and protein isolate (AI) in increased-fat diets. Five of the groups were fed for 4 weeks with either BD (basal diet), Chol+F (2% cholesterol, 10% porcine fat), Chol+F+E (0.005% α-tocopherol), Chol+F+AF1 or Chol+F+AI1 (25% of protein replacement) diets. The other two groups were fed for 4 weeks with Chol+F and then 1 week with Chol+F+AF2 or Chol+F+AI2 diet (50% of protein replacement). Various effects on the oxidative stress biomarkers in tissues (intestine and liver) were observed. These effects were dependent on the ingredients, dose, and administration time. In the intestinal cells, Chol+F+AF1 and Chol+F+AI2 produced an increment in the reduced glutathione (GSH) content (56% and 39%, respectively), while Chol+F+AF2 induced an increment in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) (25%) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (46%) activities. The presence of certain components in flour (e.g., fiber, polyphenols, squalene) could explain the higher activity recorded for AF. In the liver, Chol+F+AF2 produced a decrease in SOD (19%) and GSH (36%), as well as an increase in GPx (255%); Chol+F+AI1 and Chol+F+AI2 also produced a decrease in GSH (36% and 24%, respectively) and important increments in GPx activity (273% for Chol+F+AI1 and 2,900% for Chol+F+AI2 ). These effects were dependent on the AI dose and were probably produced by absorbed peptides. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: It is known that redox imbalances are involved in the genesis of many chronic diseases. Therefore, it is possible to prevent them or limit their severity by improving the body's antioxidant defense mechanisms through dietary incorporation of antioxidant substances. The results suggest that amaranth protein isolate and amaranth flour have the potential for regulating intestinal and liver cells redox balance; effects were more evident when they contributed 50% of the diet's protein content and were administered for 1 week. Both amaranth ingredients could be used as ingredients in the development of functional foods with beneficial antioxidant properties.",

Amaranth is rich in nutrients, but with high level of phytate. The objective of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of home processed amaranth grain containing bread in the treatment of anemia, hemoglobin concentration and iron deficiency anemia among two-to-five year-old children in Southern Ethiopia. METHOD: Children with anemia (hemoglobin concentration <110.0g/L) (N = 100) were identified by random sampling and enrolled in a 1:1 cluster randomized controlled trial for six months in 2017. The amaranth group (N = 50), received 150g bread containing 70% amaranth and 30% chickpea, the amaranth grain was processed at home (soaking, germinating, and fermenting) to decrease the phytate level. The maize group (N = 50), received 150g bread, containing processed maize (roasted and fermented) to give a similar color and structure with amaranth bread. Hemoglobin, ferritin, and CRP were measured at baseline and at the end of intervention. Hemoglobin and ferritin values were adjusted for altitude and infection, respectively. Generalized estimating equation and generalized linear model were used to analyze the data. RESULT: In the last follow-up measure anemia prevalence was significantly lower in the amaranth group (32%) as compared with the maize group (56%) [adjusted risk ratios, aRR: 0.39 (95%CI: 0.16-0.77)]. Hemoglobin concentration estimate of beta coefficient was significantly higher in the amaranth group compared with the maize group [aβ 8.9g/L (95%CI: 3.5-14.3)], p-value <0.01. The risk of iron deficiency anemia is significantly lower in the amaranth group [aRR: 0.44 (95%CI: 0.23-0.83)] in the intention to treat analysis but not significant in the complete case analysis. There was no significant difference between groups in iron deficiency [aRR: 0.81 (95%CI: 0.55-1.19)]. CONCLUSION: Processed amaranth bread had favorable effects on hemoglobin concentration and has the potential to minimize anemia prevalence.

These oils are also known to lower glucose and cholesterol levels. The current study compared the effects exerted by RSO and ASO on weight loss and metabolic parameters during a 3-week body mass reduction program. METHODS: Eighty-one obese subjects (BMI > 30 kg/m2), aged 25-70 years, were enrolled in a 3-week body mass reduction program based on a calorie-restricted diet and physical activity. Participants were randomly categorized into an AO group (administered 20 mL/d of ASO), a RO group (administered 20 mL/d of RSO), and a C group (control; untreated). Anthropometric and metabolic parameters were measured at baseline and endpoint. RESULTS: Significant decreases in weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), fat mass (FM), lean body mass (LBM), visceral fat mass (VFM), and total body water (TBW%) were observed in all groups (P <  0.05). No significant improvements were observed in the clinical parameters of group C. Fasting insulin (Δ - 5.9, and Δ - 5.7) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (Δ - 1.1 and Δ - 0.5) were decreased in both RO and AO groups, respectively. Fasting glucose (Δ -8.5; P = 0.034), total cholesterol (Δ -14.6; P = 0.032), non-HDL cholesterol (Δ 15.9; P = 0.010), TG/HDL ratio (Δ -0.6; P = 0.032), LDL cholesterol (Δ -12.3; P = 0.042), and triglycerides (Δ -6.5; P = 0.000) were significantly improved in the AO group, compared to the RO group. CONCLUSIONS: The 3-week body mass reduction intervention caused a significant reduction in the weight, BMI, WC, HC, FM, and VFM of all groups. Except for HOMA-IR, there were no statistical differences between the clinical parameters of all groups. However, a trend toward improved insulin levels and HDL% was noticeable in AO and RO. Therapies involving edible oils with high nutritional value, such as RSO and ASO, show potential for improving metabolic measurements during body mass reduction programs. Thus, obese patients undertaking weight reduction programs may benefit from RSO and ASO supplementation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: retrospectively registered, DRKS00017708.",

This study was conducted to evaluate the potential of grain amaranth for remediation of soils contaminated with Cd. Three grain amaranth varieties, \"Pribina\" (A. cruentus), \"Zobor\" (A. hypochondriacus x A. hybridus) and Plainsman (A. hypochondriacus x A. hybridus) were tested under different level of Cd (0, 5, 10 and 15 mg/L) in a hydroponic experimental treatment. All could be classified as Cd excluders or Cd-hypertolerant varieties able to grow and accumulate significant amounts of Cd from the hydroponic solution, preferentially in the roots. Under the highest level of Cd exposure, qRT-PCR expression analysis of five stress-related genes was examined in above- and below-ground biomass. The results show that the Cd concentration significantly increased the mRNA level of chitinase 5 (Chit 5) in amaranth roots as the primary site of metal stress. The involvement of phytochelatin synthase (PCS1) in Cd detoxification is suggested. Based on our findings, we can conclude that variety \"Pribina\" is the most Cd-tolerant among three tested and can be expected to be used in the phytomanagement of Cd loaded soils as an effective phytostabiliser."

The present study was conducted to characterize loom-dye effluents and investigate their health implications by the growth analysis of rice and red amaranth seedlings along with a survey study among the individuals associated with loom-dyeing, weaving, and crop farming activities. A total of twenty-eight loom-dye effluent samples were collected for physicochemical characterization; among them, only three loom-dye effluents, i.e. pink, violet, and black dyes, at concentrations of 0, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100% were applied as irrigation water to rice and red amaranth. The plant growth experiment was laid out following a completely randomized design with three replicas. Chemical analyses of loom-dye effluents showed the presence of a significant amount of plant nutrients and heavy metals. The mean concentrations of Pb, Cd, Cr, Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu were 0.938, 0.046, 0.212, 7.109, 0.609, 0.351, and 0.191 mg L-1, respectively. Among the metals, the concentrations of Pb, Cr, Fe, and Mn were above the recommended limit proposed by the irrigation water guideline value. Application of ≤ 25% pink and violet dye effluent and ≤ 10% black dye effluent had significant (p < 0.05) and positive impacts on growth and yield parameters. Heavy metal content in seedlings increased with increasing effluent application rate and crossed the utmost permissible limit at higher concentration. Survey data discovered a moderate knowledge level among the respondents, which might account for the indiscriminate discharge of loom-dye effluent into the surrounding environment. Attitudes, practices, and protective behaviours of the respondents also reflect the caused for long-term pollution through loom-dye effluents. To reduce its negative effects on the health and crop environment, the loom-dye effluents should not be discharged indiscriminately and used for crop irrigation without proper treatment. Furthermore, training programs ought to be introduced to educate the individuals involved in the discharge and subsequent use of loom-dye effluents.",

Accumulation of Cd and BDE-209 in crops has possibly harmful effects on local human health. In order to assess the potential of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and amaranth (Amaranthus hypochondriacus L.) in remediation of soil co-contaminated with Cd and BDE-209, pot trials were performed to investigate interactive effects of AM fungi, Cd and BDE-209 on growth of amaranth, uptake of Cd and BDE-209, distribution of chemical forms of Cd and activities of antioxidant enzymes in shoots and dissipation of BDE-209 in soil. The present results showed that shoot biomass of non-mycorrhizal plants was significantly inhibited by increasing of Cd addition (5-15 mg kg-1), but were only slightly declined with BDE-209 addition (5 mg kg-1). The interaction of Cd and BDE-209 reduced the proportions of ethanol- and d-H2O-extractable Cd in shoots, consequently alleviated Cd toxicity to plants and enhanced root uptake of Cd and BDE-209. Inoculation of AM fungi resulted in significantly greater shoot biomass as well as higher concentrations of Cd and BDE-209 compared with non-mycorrhizal treatment. Moreover, AM fungi played a beneficial role in relieving oxidative stress on amaranth by increasing the activities of dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in shoots and significantly improved the dissipation of BDE-209 in soil. The present study suggested that combination of AM fungi and amaranth may be a potential option for remediation of Cd and BDE-209 co-contaminated soils.",

      "abstract": "Strategies to prevent cadmium (Cd) mobilization by crops under salinity conditions differs among distinct genotypes, but the biological mechanisms of Cd accumulation in different genotype crops promoted by salinity have remained scarce. In this study, we investigated the biological mechanisms of Cd accumulation in two quite different amaranth cultivars of low-Cd accumulator Quanhong (QH) and high-Cd accumulator Liuye (LY) in response to salt stress. Transcriptomes analysis was carried out on leaves and roots tissues of LY and QH grown with exchangeable Cd 0.27 mg kg-1 and salinity 3.0 g kg-1 treatment or control conditions, respectively. A total of 3224 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in LY (1119 in roots, 2105 in leaves) and 848 in QH (207 in roots, 641 in leaves) were identified. Almost in each fold change category (2-25, 25-210, >210), the numbers of DEGs induced by salinity in LY treatments were much more than those in QH treatments, indicating that LY is more salt sensitive. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that salinity stress promoted soil acidification and Cd mobilization in LY treatments through the enhancive expression of genes related to adenine metabolism (84-fold enrichment) and proton pumping ATPase (50-fold enrichment) in roots, and carbohydrate hydrolysis (2.5-fold enrichment) in leaves compared with that of whole genome, respectively. The genes expression of organic acid transporter (ALMT) was promoted by 2.71- to 3.94-fold in roots, facilitating the secretion of organic acids. Salt stress also inhibited the expression of key enzymes related to cell wall biosynthesis in roots, reducing the physical barriers for Cd uptake. All these processes altered in LY were more substantially compared with that of QH, suggesting that salt sensitive cultivars might accumulate more Cd and pose a higher health risk.",

Here we demonstrate an alkaline isolation method to extract amaranth and quinoa starch from flour while retaining a high protein content, which gives these materials an emulsifying ability comparable to octenyl succinylated starches in the literature. We highlight the key role played by protein by showing that a serial reduction of the protein content leads to a parallel reduction in emulsifying ability, and that pH affects this ability. Our method of retaining proteins naturally present in amaranth and quinoa not only bolsters their nutritional profile but also takes advantage of these proteins' native hydrophobicity for improved emulsification.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive deterioration and impaired activities of daily living. Current treatments provide only minor symptomatic improvements with limited benefit duration. Lanabecestat, a brain-permeable inhibitor of human beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1/β-secretase), was developed to modify the clinical course of AD by slowing disease progression. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether lanabecestat slows the progression of AD compared with placebo in patients with early AD (mild cognitive impairment) and mild AD dementia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: AMARANTH (first patient visit on September 30, 2014; last patient visit on October 4, 2018) and DAYBREAK-ALZ (first patient visit on July 1, 2016; last patient visit on September 28, 2018) were randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2/3 and phase 3 clinical trials lasting 104 weeks and 78 weeks, respectively. AMARANTH and DAYBREAK-ALZ were multicenter, global, double-blind studies conducted at 257 and 251 centers, respectively, located in 15 and 18 countries or territories, respectively. A population-based sample of men and women aged 55 to 85 years who met National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association criteria for early AD or mild AD dementia was screened using cognitive assessments, and the presence of amyloid was confirmed. Patients were excluded for unstable medical conditions or medication use, significant cerebrovascular pathologic findings, or a history of vitiligo and/or current evidence of postinflammatory hypopigmentation. AMARANTH screened 6871 patients; 2218 (32.3%) were randomized, and 539 patients completed the study. DAYBREAK-ALZ screened 5706 patients; 1722 (30.2%) were randomized, and 76 patients completed the study. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to once-daily oral doses of lanabecestat (20 mg), lanabecestat (50 mg), or placebo. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was change from baseline on the 13-item Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale. Secondary outcomes included Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Inventory, Clinical Dementia Rating, Functional Activities Questionnaire, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Efficacy analyses were conducted on the intent-to-treat population. RESULTS: Among 2218 AMARANTH patients, the mean (SD) age was 71.3 (7.1) years, and 1177 of 2218 (53.1%) were women. Among 1722 DAYBREAK-ALZ patients, the mean (SD) age was 72.3 (7.0) years, and 1023 of 1722 (59.4%) were women. Both studies were terminated early after futility analysis. There were no consistent, reproducible dose-related findings on primary or secondary efficacy measures. Psychiatric adverse events, weight loss, and hair color changes were reported in a higher percentage of patients receiving lanabecestat than placebo. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Treatment with lanabecestat was well tolerated and did not slow cognitive or functional decline.

      "abstract": "The aim of this review was to summarize data regarding amaranth as a potential component of lifestyle modification to improve cardiovascular risk profiles by modifying cardiovascular risk factors such as cholesterol, diabetes, and hypertension. PubMed was searched for appropriate articles. The main inclusion criteria for articles were as follows: interventions with amaranth; conducted in humans or animals or in vitro; and reported serum lipids and lipoprotein levels, and antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and antioxidant abilities. The outcome measures were changes in serum lipids and the presence of antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and antioxidant activity. A total of 33 articles were included herein. Regarding hypolipidemic activity, most studies investigated the effect of intervention with amaranth in animals, and fewer studies were performed in humans. Most studies in animal models demonstrated the ability of amaranth to decrease total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Pilot studies in humans were not convincing regarding amaranth's lipid-lowering activity. Based on this search, it is not clear which constituents are potentially responsible for the hypocholesterolemic effect of amaranth. Some authors tend to think that squalene can play a role in this effect, whereas others suggest that different components of amaranth are of greater importance (eg, sterols, oil fractions rich in fatty acids, proteins, amino acids, or fiber) for its hypocholesterolemic effect. It is possible that several constituents are jointly responsible for this action. Regarding the antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and antioxidant activities, most studies were performed in vitro and showed good potential for all three biological effects. Future research should focus on clarifying the effect of amaranth on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, identifying the constituents responsible for these beneficial effects, and providing more data regarding its use in humans, ideally using randomized controlled trials. The antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and antioxidant activities found in vitro should be confirmed further in animal or human models.",

A total of five different treatments viz., AI (1.5% amaranth), AII (3% amaranth), QI (1.5% quinoa) and QII (3% quinoa) were prepared. The physicochemical, colour, texture, sensory and rheological properties of these pseudocereal-added products were evaluated against control (3% refined wheat flour). Emulsion stability of meat batter was significantly affected (P < 0.05) due to addition of amaranth flour (1.5% and 3%) and quinoa (3%). Treatment groups AII and QI had significantly low (P < 0.05) moisture content with respect to control while the amount of fat content showed a reverse trend. Addition of amaranth and quinoa significantly increased (P < 0.05) the dietary fibre in meat products. Rheology of meat batter was affected by types and level of pseudocereal incorporation. Treatment AII had low (P < 0.05) hunter colour lightness value, whereas redness value was low for treatment QI. Effect of added amaranth and quinoa flour was observed on the textural parameters like adhesiveness, cohesiveness, gumminess and chewiness. High scores for almost all the sensory parameters were recorded in pseudocereal-added meat products. Though, all the products were very much acceptable, product with 1.5% quinoa flour was found to have high (P < 0.05) overall acceptability score."

Iron (Fe) is chemically similar to Cd and may mediate Cd-induced physiological or metabolic impacts in plants. The purpose was to investigate the model of time-dependent and concentration-dependent kinetics of Cd absorption under Fe deficiency, understanding the physiological mechanism of Cd absorption in amaranth roots. The kinetic characteristics of Cd uptake by amaranth grown in Cd enriched nutritional solution with or without Fe addition and with methanol-chloroform, carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), and lanthanum chloride (LaCl3) were compared using 109Cd2+ isotope labeling technique. The results showed that Cd uptake was time-dependent and about 90-93% of uptake occurred during the first 150 min. The kinetics of Cd uptake showed that two stages were involved. The saturation stage fitted the Michaelis-Menten model when concentrations of Cd were lower than 12.71 μmol/L and then the absorption of Cd by roots was increased linearly during the second stage. Only linear absorption was observed with methanol-chloroform treatment while the metabolic inhibitor CCCP inhibited only the saturation absorption process, and the Ca channel inhibitor LaCl3 partially inhibited the two stages of absorption. These results indicated that the root absorption of 109Cd2+ was enhanced under Fe deficiency which induced more Fe transporters in the root cell membrane, and the Ca channel, apoplastic and symplastic pathways enhanced the Cd absorption in roots.",

We compared the cellular distribution and accumulation of Cd in roots, stems, and leaves between a low-Cd accumulating cultivar (Zibeixian, L-Cd) and a high-Cd accumulating cultivar (Tianxingmi, H-Cd) in a hydroponic experimental system. In all treatments, H-Cd grew better than L-Cd and accumulated more Cd. As the Cd concentration increased, the H-Cd plants grew normally and their biomass increased, except in the 60 μM Cd treatment. The biomass of L-Cd decreased with increasing Cd concentrations. The highest Cd concentration in the roots, stems, and leaves of H-Cd was 950 mg/kg, 305 mg/kg, and 205 mg/kg, respectively, compared with 269 mg/kg, 62.9 mg/kg, and 74.8 mg/kg, respectively, in L-Cd. The Cd distribution differed between the two cultivars. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectrometry analyses showed that Cd was distributed across the entire cross section of H-Cd roots but largely restricted to the epidermal cells and the exodermis of L-Cd roots. The main Cd storage sites were the root apoplast, cell walls, and intercellular spaces in H-Cd and the root epidermal cells and the exodermis in L-Cd. In H-Cd leaves, Cd accumulated mainly in vacuoles of epidermal cells and, at high external Cd concentrations, in the vacuoles of mesophyll cells.",

Both doughs and sourdoughs, the latter prepared by a two-step fermentation with Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and Candida milleri, were studied. In order to evaluate the IgG-binding capacity toward the proteins of the studied flours, total protein as well as protein fractions enriched in albumins/globulins, prolamins and glutelins, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results showed that while mTG modified both gluten and gluten-free flour by increasing the amount of cross-linked proteins, it did not affect the serum's immune-recognition. In fact, no significant differences were observed in the immunoreactivity of sera from CD and NCGS patients toward wheat and gluten-free protein extracts after enzyme treatment, nor did this biotechnological treatment affect the immunoreactivity of control samples or the sera of healthy patients. These results suggest that mTG may be used as a tool to create innovative gluten and gluten-free products with improved structural properties, without increasing the immune-reactivity toward proteins present either in doughs or in sourdoughs."

Results showed that the combination of mycorrhizal amaranth and 0.4% β-CD (RI+β0.4) significantly enhanced Cd concentrations and contents in shoots, total PBDEs concentration in roots, and BDE-209 dissipation in soil. Moreover, the RI+β0.4 treatment exerted the highest removal efficiency of both Cd and BDE-209. On the contrary, the xylem area, shoot Cd and BDE-209 concentrations and contents, and removal efficiency of Cd were markedly reduced in mycorrhizal amaranth with 0.8% or 1.2% β-CD treatments (RI+β0.8, RI+β1.2), compared with single inoculation treatment. The well-organized chloroplast and well-defined root anatomical structure were also observed in the treatment of RI+β0.4. Positive correlation was found between shoot biomass and chlorophyll concentrations. Shoot Cd or BDE-209 concentrations were positively correlated with xylem areas. In conclusion, mycorrhizal amaranth added with 0.4% β-CD could be used for the decontamination of soil polluted with mixture of Cd and BDE-209 due to the higher chlorophyll concentration and the larger xylem area."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Amaranth and canola oils have been used traditionally. Amaranth has been identified as being of interest because of its outstanding nutritive value. Amaranth oil is a rich source of highly unsaturated fats and so could be a valuable dietary alternative for individuals affected with obesity. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are postulated to be involved in systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. Activated polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) generate high amounts of reactive oxygen species. OBJECTIVE: Our study investigates the impact of amaranth and canola oils supplementation on oxidative metabolism in patients with obesity. We hypothesized that, due to its lipid-lowering and antioxidant properties, amaranth and canola oil would protect against oxidative stress. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We tested 19 obese patients [body mass index (BMI) = 41.1 ± 7.8 kg/m2, (mean ± SD)]. The protocol consisted of two stages: a run-in phase of 2 weeks and an experimental stage - canola or amaranth oil supplementation (20 mL/d) with calorie restriction diet for 3 weeks. The neutrophil oxidative burst was expressed by fluorescence intensity (IF). RESULTS: The oxidative burst had increased significantly at the end of treatment in both groups IF: (21.4 ± 11.15 vs. 35.9 ± 20.3; mean ± SD) p < 0.05. The levels of IF were significantly higher in neutrophils of patients who received canola oil (41.05 ± 25.3) compared to those who received amaranth oil (28.4 ± 11.8) p < 0.05. CONCLUSIONS: Canola oil exerts possible effects on oxidative burst activity in neutrophils in vivo conditions.",

      "abstract": "For centuries, Amaranthus sp. were used as food, ornamentals, and medication. Molecular mechanisms, explaining the health beneficial properties of amaranth, are not yet understood, but have been attributed to secondary metabolites, such as phenolic compounds. One of the most abundant phenolic compounds in amaranth leaves is 2-caffeoylisocitric acid (C-IA) and regarding food occurrence, C-IA is exclusively found in various amaranth species. In the present study, the anti-inflammatory activity of C-IA, chlorogenic acid, and caffeic acid in LPS-challenged macrophages (RAW 264.7) has been investigated and cellular contents of the caffeic acid derivatives (CADs) were quantified in the cells and media. The CADs were quantified in the cell lysates in nanomolar concentrations, indicating a cellular uptake. Treatment of LPS-challenged RAW 264.7 cells with 10 µM of CADs counteracted the LPS effects and led to significantly lower mRNA and protein levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin 6, by directly decreasing the translocation of the nuclear factor κB/Rel-like containing protein 65 into the nucleus. This work provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms that attribute to amaranth's anti-inflammatory properties and highlights C-IA's potential as a health-beneficial compound for future research.",

Inhibition of proliferation of HT-29 cells was exhibited after a 24 h treatment with different concentrations of amaranth protein isolate (API) and the peptides released after digestion (DGS), presenting IC50 values of 1.35 ± 0.12 and 0.30 ± 0.07 mg soluble protein/mL, respectively. Lactate dehydrogenase assay indicated that both samples caused the loss of membrane integrity and cell lysis over HT-29 cells, and DAPI fluorescence microscopies evidenced typical apoptotic features. Moreover, Annexin V-FITC flow cytometry showed a significant increase of early apoptotic and late apoptotic/necrotic HT-29 cells compared to untreated ones, and caspase-3 assay confirmed the apoptosis induction with a 43.0 ± 10.3 and 65.8 ± 12.7% increase of caspase-3 activity produced by a 2 mg/mL treatment of API and DGS, respectively. In conclusion, amaranth peptides successfully released after simulated gastrointestinal digestion would exert a potential antiproliferative activity over HT-29 tumor cells. This effect was linked to the induction of cell necrosis and apoptosis, supporting the idea of using amaranth proteins as a potential food alternative ingredient for functional foods.",

This is the first study to compare the effects of MWCNTs and MMWCNTs under natural DHAs on their toxicity to amaranth. When DHAs were combined with 0.5 g/L MWCNTs, 1:2:1 MMWCNTs and 4:2:1 MMWCNTs nanomaterials, DHA1 and DHA4 both increased the pH of Hoagland's solutions. DHA1 more severely decreased the soluble protein levels in shoots than DHA4 in the 1:2:1 MMWCNT and 4:2:1 MMWCNT treatments. DHA1 and DHA4 both increased the chlorophyll concentrations of amaranth treated with MWCNTs, decreased the chlorophyll concentrations in the MMWCNT treatments. Co-exposure of DHAs and carbon-based CNTs caused further decreases in the anthocyanin level as compared to the respective CNT alone treatment. In the nanomaterial alone treatment, both 0.25 and 4:2:1 MMWCNTs greatly lowered the anthocyanin level as compared to the other two CNTs with the same exposure dose. Transmission electron microscopy images showed that the interaction between 4:2:1 MMWCNT and DHA4 had more serious effects on plant cells across all the treatments.",

      "abstract": "This study deals with the electrochemical degradation of Amaranth in aqueous solution by means of stainless steel (SS) electrodes coated with a SiOx interlayer deposited by Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition and a modified PbO2 top layer deposited by continuous galvanostatic electrodeposition. The morphological characterization of the PbO2 top-layer performed by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope put in evidence that the SiOx, interlayer allows obtaining a more integrated PbO2/SS electrode with a very homogeneous PbO2 film. The composition of the lead oxide layer was investigated by X-ray Diffractometry, showing that the β-PbO2/α-PbO2 ratio in the top layer deposited on the SiOx film was four times higher respect to the one deposited directly on the stainless steel surface. In addition, the electrochemical behaviour of SS/SiOx/PbO2 interfaces was studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The EIS results showed that the presence of SiOx favors electron transfer within the oxide layer which improves electro-oxidation capability. Moreover, bulk electrolysis showed that over 100% colour removal and 84% COD removal, using SS/SiOx/PbO2 at acidic pH were reached after 300 min. High Performance Liquid Chromatography analysis was used for the quantitative determinations of initial Amaranth dye molecule removal and to evaluate its specific degradation rate. In order to evaluate the phototoxicity of treated solution with different by-products, different tests of germination were performed and proved that the electrochemical treatment with modified PbO2 could be as an efficient technology for reducing hazardous wastewater toxicity and able to produce water available for reuse.",

      "abstract": "Exogenous glycinebetaine treatment is an effective measure for preventing crops from being exposed to drought and high temperature; however, the effects of this approach on the soil Cd uptake and accumulation by crops remain unclear. Pot experiments were conducted in this study to analyze the effect of glycinebetaine on the soil Cd uptake and accumulation by edible amaranth cultivated in Cd-contaminated soil. Results revealed that after exogenous glycinebetaine treatment on amaranth leaves during the vigorous growth period, the plant biomass, the Cd concentrations in the roots and shoots, and the Cd translocation factor (TF) were significantly higher than those of the control group. The highest Cd concentrations in the roots and shoots and the TF were higher by 91%, 96% and 23.8%, respectively, than the corresponding values in the control group. In addition, exogenous glycinebetaine treatment significantly increased leaf chlorophyll content and promoted the photosynthesis of edible amaranth. Consequently, the contents of soluble sugar, dissolved organic carbon, and low-molecular-weight organic acids significantly increased in the rhizosphere, resulting in Cd mobilization. Significant positive correlations were observed among the contents of leaf chlorophyll, Mg, Fe, pectin and Ca. Given that Cd shares absorption and translocation channels with these elements, we speculated that the increased leaf chlorophyll and pectin contents promoted the absorption and accumulation of Mg, Fe and Ca, which further promoted the absorption and translocation of Cd. These results indicated that exogenous glycinebetaine treatment during hot season would aggravate the health risks of crops grown in Cd-contaminated soils.",

Two edible amaranth cultivars (Amaranthus mangostanus L.), Quanhong (low-Cd accumulator; LC) and Liuye (high-Cd accumulator; HC), were subject to salinity treatment in both soil and hydroponic cultures. The total amount of mobilized Cd in rhizosphere soil under salinity treatment increased by 2.78-fold in LC cultivar and 4.36-fold in HC cultivar compared with controls, with 51.2% in LC cultivar and 80.5% in HC cultivar being attributed to biological mobilization of salinity. Multivariate statistical analysis generated from metabolite profiles in both rhizosphere soil and root revealed clear discrimination between control and salt treated samples. Tricarboxylic acid cycle in root was up-regulated to cope with salinity treatment, which promoted release of organic acids from root. The increased accumulation of organic acids in rhizosphere under salt stress obviously promoted soil Cd mobility. These results suggested that salinity promoted release of organic acids from root and enhanced soil Cd mobilization and accumulation in edible amaranth cultivar in soil culture.",

The starch extracted by the aqueous method presented low lipid and protein content. After HMT, an increase in the thermal stability was identified. The onset and peak temperatures were higher with an increase in moisture content and the times used in the modification. The gelatinisation enthalpy varied due to the heterogeneity of the crystals formed after the structural reorganisation caused by HMT. The relative crystallinity was lower for the physically modified starches. An increase in the pasting temperature was accompanied by a decrease in the viscosity, setback and breakdown, which were proportional to the moisture and time used. The morphology of the HMT-modified samples was not altered; however, agglomerations were noted. Low levels of dispersion homogeneity and suspension stability were observed for the modified samples due to the strong presence of agglomerates.",

Results showed that the white-rot fungus was beneficial to the growth of amaranth, Cd uptake and BDE-209 degradation. Addition of β-CD further increased biomass of both shoots and roots, shoot Cd concentrations and contents, chlorophyll concentrations and soil manganese peroxidase (MnP) activities. Furthermore, well-organized mesophyll cells were observed in β-CD treatments, implying that the combination of white-rot fungus and β-CD can alleviate the stresses of Cd and BDE-209 to mesophyll cells. The BDE-209 degradation rate was positively correlated to β-CD concentration and MnP activity in soil. Our results also revealed that RF+β0.8 treatment possessed the greatest Cd removal efficiency due to its well-configured mesophyll cells and the highest shoot biomass, chlorophyll concentration, and shoot Cd concentration. Considering simultaneous removal of Cd and BDE-209 from soil, using 0.8% β-CD to amaranth inoculated with white-rot fungus is a promising way forward for the phytoremediation of soil co-contaminated with Cd and BDE-209. A high percentage of mono-BDE was detected in inoculated amaranth, suggesting that BDE-209 was debrominated into low brominated PBDEs by the fungus in soil, which were then absorbed and further debrominated into mono-BDE in the plant.",

Currently, reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) is a high-throughput, sensitive and widely used method for gene expression analysis. Nevertheless, RT-qPCR requires precise normalisation of data to avoid the misinterpretation of experimental data. In this sense, the selection of reference genes is critical for gene expression analysis. At this time, several studies focus on the selection of reference genes in several species. However, the identification and validation of reference genes for the normalisation of RT-qPCR have not been described in amaranth. A set of seven housekeeping genes were analysed using RT-qPCR, to determine the most stable reference genes in amaranth for normalisation of gene expression analysis. Transcript stability and gene expression level of candidate reference genes were analysed in different tissues, at different developmental stages and under different types of stress. The data were compared using the geNorm, NormFinder and Bestkeeper statistical methods. The reference genes optimum for normalisation of data varied with respect to treatment. The results indicate that AhyMDH, AhyGAPDH, AhyEF-1α and AhyACT would be optimum for accurate normalisation of experimental data, when all treatment are analysed in the same experiment. This study presents the most stable reference genes for normalisation of gene expression analysis in amaranth, which will contribute significantly to future gene studies of this species.",

However, only a handful of studies have investigated the effects of treating seeds with electric current prior to their germination on the enzymatic antioxidant system of their sprouts. The aim of this study was to determine the changes in bioactive compounds and the enzymatic antioxidant activities in seeds and amaranth sprouts under direct electric current (DC) treatments. Amaranth seeds were treated with DC at 500 mA for different periods of time (0, 2, 5, 10 and 30 min) and let sprout (85% RH, 25 ± 2 °C) for 6 days. Significant changes were found in the antioxidant enzymatic activities and in the total content of flavonoids (15.44 ± 0.56 mg RE/gDW) and phenolic compounds (35.87 ± 0.17 mg GAE/gDW) in 6-day-old sprouts from DC-treated seeds in comparison to sprouts form non-treated seeds. The results suggested that DC treatment for short period (5 min) can induce quantitative changes to the enzymatic antioxidant system of amaranth sprouts, thus representing a relatively cost-effective method for enhancing health-improving properties of sprouts."

Alternative to the use of non-gluten containing grains to prepare GF bread, the gluten reactivity has been greatly reduced using a proline specific cleavage enzyme, however, the gluten functionality was lost. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of adding an amaranth flour blend (AFB) to enzymatically modified wheat-flour proteins on dough functionality and to evaluate the immunoreactivity and acceptability of the prepared bread. First, wheat flour (20% w/v, substrate) was hydrolyzed using 8.4 U mg-1 protein Aspergillus niger prolyl-endopeptidase (AnPEP) for 8 h at 40 °C under constant agitation. Four types of breads were prepared with the same formulation except for the type of flour (14% w.b.): wheat flour (WF), WF-AFB unmodified not incubated, WF-AFB unmodified incubated and WF-AFB modified. The protein composition and free thiols were analyzed before and after amaranth addition, and the flour and bread proteins were run using SDS-PAGE and immune-detected in blots with IgA from celiac disease patients. The immunoreactive gluten content, specific volume and bread acceptability were evaluated. The polymeric proteins and free thiol groups of WF decreased after AnPEP treatment. The electrophoretic patterns of the modified flour and bread proteins were different and the IgA-immunodetection in blots was highly reduced, particularly for the higher molecular weight subunits. The addition of AFB to the modified wheat flour prepared using AnPEP improved the dough functionality by increasing the thiol groups and allowed the preparation of a sensorially acceptable bread with only 60 mg kg-1 immunoreactive gluten.",

Because our previous study revealed the accumulation of the protein adducts of lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) in GM, which persists after eradication of H. pylori, the aim of the study was to test whether Amaranth oil supplementation in addition to standard anti-Helicobacter treatment could prevent such accumulation of HNE in GM in H. pylori-positive DPU patients. Seventy-five patients were randomly split into two groups: group 1 - standard treatment (n = 39) and group 2 - standard treatment with additional supplementation of 1 ml of concentrated oil from amaranth seeds (Amaranthus cruenthus L., n = 36). Clinical analysis, including endoscopy with biopsies from antrum and corpus of the stomach were performed before and after the treatment, as was heart rate variability (HRV) recorded, as parameter of systemic, extragastric pathophysiological alterations in DPU patients. Improvement of clinical, endoscopic and histologic manifestations, and successful ulcer healing were observed in both the groups. Moreover, supplementation of amaranth oil in addition to standard anti-H. pylori treatment significantly reduced accumulation of HNE-histidine adducts in GM and increased HRV in DPU patients (p < .05). Therefore, standard treatments of DPU require additional therapeutic approaches, in accordance with integrative medicine principles, aiming to reduce persistence of oxidative stress, as was successfully done in our study by the use of amaranth oil.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The health effects of Amaranth Oil (AO) are attributed to its specific chemical composition. That makes it an outstanding natural product for the prevention and treatment of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation-related pathologies such as sunburn, photoaging, photoimmunosuppression, and photocarcinogenesis. Most of the studies are taken on animal model, and there is a lack of research on the endogenous effect of AO on fibroblast level, where UVA takes it harmful place. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was evaluation if AO can protect or abolish UVA exposure effect on human skin fibroblast. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 0.1% AO, 0.25% AO, and 0.5% AO concentration and irradiation for 15 min under UVA-emitting lamp were studied in various condition. In all experiments, the mean values for six assays ± standard deviations were calculated. RESULTS: Pretreatment with various concentrations of AO was tested. The highest concentration of AO where cell survival was observed was 0.5%. Cytotoxicity assays provided evidence for pre- and post-UVA protective effect of 0.1% AO among three tested concentrations. The results also provide evidence that UVA has inhibitory effect on collagen biosynthesis in confluent skin fibroblast, but presence of 0.1% AO abolishes pre- and post-UVA effect comparing to other used AO concentration. The assessment results on DNA biosynthesis show the significant abolished post-UVA effect when 0.1% and 0.5% of AO were added. CONCLUSION: AO gives pre- and post-UVA protection in low concentration. This provides the evidence for using it not as a main protective factor against UV but as one of the combined components in cosmetic formulation. SUMMARY: The recommended Amaranth Oil (AO) concentration in cosmetic formulation is between 0.1 and 5%Pretreatment with various concentrations of AO suggests to use the highest 0.5% concentration of AO in human skin fibroblast culturesThe 0.1% of AO in fibroblast cultures, protects and abolishes effect of ultraviolet A (UVA) exposureUVA has inhibitory effect on collagen biosynthesis in skin fibroblast, but presence of 0.1% AO abolishes pre- and post-UVA effectThe abolished post-UVA effect occurs when 0.1% and 0.5% of AO were added on DNA biosynthesis.

The ABCW reactor was planted with common reed (Phragmite australis) where the hydraulic retention time (HRT) was set to 1 day and was fed with synthetic wastewater with the addition of Amaranth dye. Supplementary aeration was supplied in designated compartments of the ABCW reactor to control the aerobic and anaerobic zones. After Amaranth dye addition the COD reduction efficiency dropped from 98 to 91% while the color removal efficiency was 100%. Degradation of azo bond in Amaranth dye is shown by the UV-Vis spectrum analysis which demonstrates partial degradation of Amaranth dye metabolites. The performance of the baffled unit is due to the longer pathway as there is the up-flow and down-flow condition sequentially, thus allowing more contact of the wastewater with the rhizomes and micro-aerobic zones.",

      "abstract": "Herbicides that inhibit hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) such as mesotrione are widely used to control a broad spectrum of weeds in agriculture. Amaranthus palmeri is an economically troublesome weed throughout the United States. The first case of evolution of resistance to HPPD-inhibiting herbicides in A. palmeri was documented in Kansas (KS) and later in Nebraska (NE). The objective of this study was to investigate the mechansim of HPPD-inhibitor (mesotrione) resistance in A. palmeri. Dose response analysis revealed that this population (KSR) was 10-18 times more resistant than their sensitive counterparts (MSS or KSS). Absorbtion and translocation analysis of [14C] mesotrione suggested that these mechanisms were not involved in the resistance in A. palmeri. Importantly, mesotrione (>90%) was detoxified markedly faster in the resistant populations (KSR and NER), within 24 hours after treatment (HAT) compared to sensitive plants (MSS, KSS, or NER). However, at 48 HAT all populations metabolized the mesotrione, suggesting additional factors may contribute to this resistance. Further evaluation of mesotrione-resistant A. palmeri did not reveal any specific resistance-conferring mutations nor amplification of HPPD gene, the molecular target of mesotrione. However, the resistant populations showed 4- to 12-fold increase in HPPD gene expression. This increase in HPPD transcript levels was accompanied by increased HPPD protein expression. The significant aspects of this research include: the mesotrione resistance in A. palmeri is conferred primarily by rapid detoxification (non-target-site based) of mesotrione; additionally, increased HPPD gene expression (target-site based) also contributes to the resistance mechanism in the evolution of herbicide resistance in this naturally occurring weed species."

      "abstract": "Both spiny and edible amaranths (Amaranthus spinosus and A. tricolor) are exotic annuals in China that produce numerous small seeds every year. Spiny amaranth has become a successful invader and a troublesome weed in Xishuangbanna, but edible amaranth has not, although it is widely grown as a vegetable there. As seed germination is one of the most important life-stages contributing to the ability of a plant to become invasive, we conducted experiments to compare the effects of high temperature and water stress on seed germination in two varieties each of spiny amaranth and edible amaranth. Overall, the seeds of both amaranth species exhibited adaptation to high temperature and water stress, including tolerance to ground temperatures of 70°C for air-dried seeds, which is consistent with their behavior in their native ranges in the tropics. As expected, the invasive spiny amaranth seeds exhibited higher tolerance to both continuous and daily periodic high-temperature treatment at 45°C, and to imbibition-desiccation treatment, compared to edible amaranth seeds. Unexpectedly, edible amaranth seeds exhibited higher germination at extreme temperatures (10°C, 15°C, and 40°C), and at lower water potential (below -0.6 MPa). It is likely that cultivation of edible amaranth has selected seed traits that include rapid germination and germination under stressful conditions, either of which, under natural conditions, may result in the death of most germinating edible amaranth seeds and prevent them from becoming invasive weeds in Xishuangbanna. This study suggests that rapid germination and high germination under stress conditions-excellent seed traits for crops and for many invasive species-might be a disadvantage under natural conditions if these traits are asynchronous with natural local conditions that support successful germination.",

      "abstract": "Following the introduction of glyphosate-resistant (GR)-cotton crops in Mexico, farmers have relied upon glyphosate as being the only herbicide for in-season weed control. Continuous use of glyphosate within the same year and over multiple successive years has resulted in the selection of glyphosate resistance in Palmer amaranth (Amarantus palmeri). Dose-response assays confirmed resistance in seven different accessions. The resistance ratio based on GR50 values (50% growth reduction) varied between 12 and 83. At 1000 μM glyphosate, shikimic acid accumulation in the S-accession was 30- to 2-fold higher at compared to R-accessions. At 96 h after treatment, 35-44% and 61% of applied 14C-glyphosate was taken up by leaves of plants from R- and S-accessions, respectively. At this time, a significantly higher proportion of the glyphosate absorbed remained in the treated leaf of R-plants (55-69%) compared to S-plants (36%). Glyphosate metabolism was low and did not differ between resistant and susceptible plants. Glyphosate was differentially metabolized to AMPA and glyoxylate in plants of R- and S-accessions, although it was low in both accessions (<10%). There were differences in 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) enzyme activity by 50% (I50) between R- and S-accessions. However, no significant differences were found in the basal EPSPS activity (μmol inorganic phosphate μg-1 total soluble protein min-1) between R- and S-accessions. A point mutation Pro-106-Ser was evidenced in three accessions. The results confirmed the resistance of Palmer amaranth accessions to glyphosate collected from GR-cotton crops from Mexico. This is the first study demonstrating glyphosate-resistance in Palmer amaranth from Mexico.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of low Cd accumulation in crops using edible amaranth (Amaranthus mangostanus L.) as a model. Fifteen amaranth cultivars were grown in long-term contaminated soil, and the differences in soil Cd mobilization, root uptake, and root-shoot translocation between low- and high-Cd accumulating cultivars were examined. The transport pathways of Cd across the root were further identified in Hoagland nutrient solution using the Ca channel blocker La3+, the ATP inhibitor 2, 4-dinitrophenol (DNP), and a nutrition-deficient culture. Cd concentrations in amaranth cultivars varied about six-fold and showed an elevated trend as the concentration of Ca and Zn increased (p < 0.01), but did not exhibit any correlation with Mg and Fe. The concentrations of essential metals (Ca, Mg, Zn, and Fe) in the rhizosphere of low-Cd cultivars were significantly lower than those of high-Cd cultivars, and decreased with decreasing levels of soluble rhizosphere exudates. These findings indicated that low co-mobilization of Cd with essential metals mediated by root-induced exudates of low-Cd cultivars contributed to its low accumulation in amaranth. Uptake of Cd was inhibited along with Ca by La3+ and DNP, but was promoted by Ca or Fe deficiency treatment. Therefore, the Ca pathway is likely the mode of Cd entry into amaranth roots, although Zn and Fe transporters may also be involved. Low-Ca cultivars exhibited lower Cd uptake capability than high-Ca cultivars. The low translocation efficiency of Cd from root to shoot also contributed to its low content accumulation in edible parts of amaranth.",

The study included 37 children aged from 1 year to 17 years, the experience of compliance with a GFD was from 6 months to 16 years. Patients underwent an assessment of nutritional status: indicators of physical development by WHO percentile tables; clinical (erythrocytes, hemoglobin, leukocytes, lymphocytes, granulocytes) and biochemical (protein, albumin, iron, ionized calcium, selenium, copper) blood indicators. After that, children diet was supplemented with products from amaranth, which they constantly ate for 9-12 months. Quality and compliance difficulties of GFD were also examined using specially designed questionnaire filled in by parents. After 9-12 months of optimized GFD the examination of children and parents questioning was repeated. Long-term regular usage of amaranth products in GDB was accompanied by an improvement of indicators of nutritional status of patients: decrease in the number of children with underweight from from 16.25 to 10.8% and increase in the patients with normal body weight from 51.4 to 56.8%; reduction in the number of children with abnormal low rise from 10.8 to 5.4%, an increase of children with an average growth from 59.5 to 67.6%. The relative number of children with a decreased level of ionized calcium in the blood serum decreased from 37.8 to 10.8%. Normalization of decreased blood serum levels of iron, copper and zinc was observed in all patients who had a deficiency of these trace elements, in 13.5, 8 and 16.2% of children respectively. Difficulties in complying with the strict diet therapy are mainly social in nature. Products of amaranth tested in the course of the study were well tolerated, allergic and dyspeptic reactions were not noted. 89.2% of parents commented positively on the new gluten-free amaranth products."

The chlorophyll derivatives in AE were also employed as a photodynamic therapy drug. Meanwhile, AuNPs and rGO both have obvious photothermal effects and can accelerate the generation of cytotoxic singlet oxygen (1O2). The temperature increase of rGO/AE/AuNPs precursor is up to 6.3 °C under 808 nm laser irradiation at a power density of 200 mW·cm(-2). The hydrogel shell on in situ tumor cells was easily formed and regulated by near-infrared irradiation within 10 min, which could both retain a high concentration of drugs on the lesion site and prevent them from migrating to normal tissue, thus reducing the side effects. Compared with rGO/AE and AE, rGO/AE/AuNPs showed a remarkably improved and synergistic antitumor effect.

Dry matter (DM), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and crude protein (CP) were determined and were divided into three categories: a = immediately soluble; b = the non-soluble but degradable; and u = non-degradable/unavailable, potential extent of degradation (PE), degradation rate (c) and effective degradation (ED). C1 passage rate was determined using acid detergent insoluble ash as a marker and was calculated to be 5.5%∙h-1. Total DM intake was highest (p < 0.05) for B and resulted in a higher (p < 0.05) CP intake. GH and AM were different in mean pH (6.81 and 6.66, respectively). B NH3 -N was greater (p < 0.05) than the other treatments. Total VFA was greatest (p < 0.05) for AM, with the greatest composition differences being a shift form acetate percentage to butyrate. DM, NDF and CP degradation was different across the treatments, where PE and ED were higher (p < 0.05) for the grain treatments. The pseudo-grains AM and Q had similar C1 degradation characteristics to B.",

Moreover, a prior alcalase treatment of the isolate followed by the same simulated gastrointestinal digestion did not improve the antioxidant capacity in any of the assays performed and even produced a negative effect under some conditions. Gastrointestinal digestion produced a strong increment in the scavenging capacity against peroxyl radicals (ORAC assay), hydroxyl radicals (ESR-OH assay), and peroxynitrites; thus decreasing the IC50 values to approximately 20, 25, and 20%, respectively, of the levels attained with the nonhydrolyzed proteins. Metal chelation (HORAC assay) also enhanced respect to isolate levels, but to a lesser extent (decreasing IC50 values to only 50%). The nitric-oxide- and superoxide-scavenging capacities of the digests were not relevant with respect to the methodologies used. The gastrointestinal digests from amaranth proteins acted against reactive species by different mechanisms, thus indicating the protein isolate to be a potential polyfunctional antioxidant ingredient.",

Treating maize with homofermentative lactic acid bacteria in combination with carbonated lime increased the amount of lactic acid about 91.9%.

To optimize the germination bioprocess, response surface methodology was applied over three response variables (AoxA, TPC, TFC). A central composite rotable experimental design with two factors [germination temperature (GT), 20-45 ºC; germination time (Gt), 14-120 h] in five levels was used; 13 treatments were generated. The amaranth seeds were soaked in distilled water (25 °C/6 h) before germination. The sprouts from each treatment were dried (50 °C/8 h), cooled, and ground to obtain germinated amaranth flours (GAF). The best combination of germination bioprocess variables for producing optimized GAF with the highest AoxA [21.56 mmol trolox equivalent (TE)/100 g sample, dw], TPC [247.63 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/100 g sample, dw], and TFC [81.39 mg catechin equivalent (CAE)/100 g sample, dw] was GT = 30 ºC/Gt = 78 h. The germination bioprocess increased AoxA, TPC, and TFC in 300-470, 829, and 213%, respectively. The germination is an effective strategy to increase the TPC and TFC of amaranth seeds for enhancing functionality with improved antioxidant activity.",

      "abstract": "Grain amaranth is a pseudocereal with unique agricultural, nutritional, and functional properties. This study was undertaken to determine the effect of different heat-processing methods on physicochemical and nutraceutical properties in two main grain amaranth species, of Amaranthus hypochondriacus L. and Amaranthus cruentus L. Grains were prepared by roasting and popping, milled and analyzed for changes in in vitro protein digestibility, gruel viscosity, pasting characteristics, antioxidant activity, flavonoids, and total phenolics. In vitro protein digestibility was determined using the pepsin-pancreatin enzyme system. Viscosity and pasting characteristics of samples were determined using a Brookfield Viscometer and a Rapid Visco Analyzer, respectively. The grain methanol extracts were analysed for phenolics using spectrophotometry while antioxidant activity was determined using the DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) method. Heat treatment led to a reduction in protein digestibility, the effect being higher in popped than in roasted samples. Viscosities for roasted grain amaranth gruels were significantly higher than those obtained from raw and popped grain amaranth gruels. The results for pasting properties were consistent with the results for viscosity. In both A. hypochondriacus L. and A. cruentus L., the order of the viscosity values was roasted>raw>popped. The viscosities were also generally lower for A. cruentus L. compared to A. hypochondriacus L. Raw samples for both A. hypochondriacus L. and A. cruentus L. did not significantly differ in total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and total antioxidant activity values. Thermal processing led to an increase in TFC and antioxidant activity. However, TPC of heat-processed samples remained unchanged. From the results, it can be concluded that heat treatment enhances antioxidant activity of grain amaranth and causes rheological changes dependent on the nature of heat treatment."

Liquid medium containing glucose has shown the highest decolorization of Amaranth by Polyporus sp. S133. When the effect of increasing inoculum concentration on decolorization of Amaranth was studied, maximum decolorization was observed with 15 % inoculum concentration. Significant increase in the enzyme production of laccase (102.2 U L(-1)) was observed over the period of Amaranth decolorization compared to lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase. Germination rate of Sorghum vulgare and Triticum aestivum was less with Amaranth treatment as compared to metabolites obtained after its decolorization. Based on the metabolites detected by GC-MS, it was proposed that Amaranth was bio-transformed into two intermediates, 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid and 1,4-naphthaquinone. Overall findings suggested the ability of Polyporus sp. S133 for the decolorization of azo dye and ensured the ecofriendly degradation of Amaranth.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Wats.) is a troublesome agronomic weed in the southern United States, and several populations have evolved resistance to glyphosate. This paper reports on spectral signatures of glyphosate-resistant (GR) and glyphosate-sensitive (GS) plants, and explores the potential of using hyperspectral sensors to distinguish GR from GS plants. RESULTS: GS plants have higher light reflectance in the visible region and lower light reflectance in the infrared region of the spectrum compared with GR plants. The normalized reflectance spectrum of the GR and GS plants had best separability in the 400-500 nm, 650-690 nm, 730-740 nm and 800-900 nm spectral regions. Fourteen wavebands from within or near these four spectral regions provided a classification of unknown set of GR and GS plants, with a validation accuracy of 94% for greenhouse-grown plants and 96% for field-grown plants. CONCLUSIONS: GR and GS Palmer amaranth plants have unique hyperspectral reflectance properties, and there are four distinct regions of the spectrum that can separate the GR from GS plants. These results demonstrate that hyperspectral imaging has potential application to distinguish GR from GS Palmer amaranth plants (without a glyphosate treatment), with future implications for glyphosate resistance management.

Using this system, we evaluated the effects of heat treatment at 260 °C for 15 s on the contents of B-group vitamins and essential and trace elements in amaranth seeds. The results showed that the treatment did not affect the content of B-group vitamins, and the recovery for essential and trace elements was 97-196%.

Results showed that treatment at pH 2.0 significantly improves the foaming properties of amaranth proteins. The structural studies performed indicate that amaranth proteins at acidic pH are denatured, dissociated and undergo partial hydrolysis due to the existence of an endoprotease. They also present a lower content of β-sheet and random coil secondary structures. Diffusion-adsorption studies of proteins at the air:water interface allowed to determine that the acidic pH favors adsorption thereof (higher values of kdiff and ka) and reduces the need for a rearrangement (higher values of γr). The interfacial behavior of amaranth proteins is a direct consequence of the structural changes they undergo at acidic pH, changes that also were reflected on the increased foaming capacity (higher vo) thus forming more dense and homogeneous foams. The behavior of the soluble proteins as surfactants was not altered by the presence of protein aggregates and insoluble proteins.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Simulating the probable impact of grain amaranth and highly absorbable, low-Fe micronutrient powder (MNP) on Fe status in a potential target population is an essential step in choosing and developing an appropriate actual intervention. DESIGN: We simulated the potential effect of fortifying maize porridge with grain amaranth or MNP on the prevalence of inadequate Fe intake and Fe deficiency using data from two cross-sectional surveys. In the first survey (2008), dietary intake data were collected by two 24 h recalls (n 197). Biochemical data (n 70) were collected in the second survey (2010). A simulation with daily consumption for 80 d of non-fortified maize porridge (60 g of maize flour), amaranth-enriched porridge (80 g of grain amaranth–maize flour, 70:30 ratio) or maize porridge fortified with MNP (2.5mg Fe as NaFeEDTA) was done. SETTING: Mwingi District, Kenya. SUBJECTS: Pre-school children aged 12–23 months. RESULTS: Prevalence of anaemia, Fe deficiency and Fe-deficiency anaemia was 49 %, 46% and 24 %, respectively. Consumption of non-fortified, amaranth-enriched and MNP-fortified maize porridge was estimated to provide a median daily Fe intake of 8.6 mg, 17.5mg and 11.1 mg, respectively. The prevalence of inadequate Fe intake was reduced to 35% in the amaranth-enriched porridge group and 45% in the MNP-fortified porridge group, while ferritin concentration was increased in both (by 1.82 (95% CI 1.42, 2.34) mg/l and 1.80 (95% CI 1.40, 2.31) μg/l, respectively; P,0.005) compared with the non-fortified maize porridge group, resulting in a decreased prevalence of Fe deficiency (27 %) in the two fortification groups. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of grain amaranth or low-Fe MNP to maize-based porridge has potential to improve Fe intake and status in pre-school children.",

The results obtained from the experiments during H(2)O(2)/TiO(2) addition show that the highest decolorization rate is provided by the combination of (UV+TiO(2)+H(2)O(2)). The decolorization efficiencies were 17%, 26%, 38% and 64% in the runs UV, UV+H(2)O(2), UV+TiO(2) and (UV+TiO(2)+H(2)O(2)) after approximately 100 min illumination periods, respectively. The observed dye degradation rates followed pseudo-first order kinetics with respect to the substrate concentration under the experimental conditions used. Different experimental conditions, such as temperature, pH and presence of electron acceptor were investigated. The temperature effect was investigated at the range of 293-313 K and it was observed that decolorization rate increased by the increase in temperature. Chemical oxygen demand and dye absorbance of the photodegraded dye solution substantially decreased. Effect of pH was also investigated and it was observed that the lower the pH the higher the degradation. In addition, an enhancement in the photodegradation rate was observed by the addition of hydrogen peroxide as an electron acceptor. The adsorption trends of Amaranth at various initial concentrations followed the Langmuir isotherm trend. This work adds to the global discussion on the role of the advanced oxidation processes in water treatment.",

      "abstract": "Gomphrena globosaL. is a popular edible plant used as food colourant and in traditional medicine. In this work, 24 phenolic compounds and eight betacyanins were determined by HPLC-DAD in three different extracts of G. globosa inflorescences. The decoction presented the highest amount of phenolic compounds, kaempferol-3-O-(6-rhamnosyl)hexoside plus kaempferol-3-O-hexoside being the main compounds. The rich betacyanins extract showed isogomphrenin III and gomphrenin III as major metabolites. Decreases in the nitric oxide amounts were observed in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. In vitro scavenging micro assays against several reactive species revealed a great antioxidant capacity, particularly against superoxide radical. In general, the best results were obtained with decoction. Some relationships between activity and composition were established. The data provide evidence of the G. globosa inflorescences potential as a source of anti-inflammatory compounds, with relevance for the treatment of acute or chronic inflammatory conditions, and health-promoting antioxidants for use by both food and pharmaceutical industries.",

      "abstract": "Few studies have evaluated the impact of fortification with iron-rich foods such as amaranth grain and multi-micronutrient powder (MNP) containing low doses of highly bioavailable iron to control iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in children. We assessed the efficacy of maize porridge enriched with amaranth grain or MNP to reduce IDA in Kenyan preschool children. In a 16-wk intervention trial, children (n = 279; 12-59 mo) were randomly assigned to: unrefined maize porridge (control; 4.1 mg of iron/meal; phytate:iron molar ratio 5:1); unrefined maize (30%) and amaranth grain (70%) porridge (amaranth group; 23 mg of iron/meal; phytate:iron molar ratio 3:1); or unrefined maize porridge with MNP (MNP group; 6.6 mg iron/meal; phytate:iron molar ratio 2.6:1; 2.5 mg iron as NaFeEDTA). Primary outcomes were anemia and iron status with treatment effects estimated relative to control. At baseline, 38% were anemic and 30% iron deficient. Consumption of MNP reduced the prevalence of anemia [-46% (95% CI: -67, -12)], iron deficiency [-70% (95% CI: -89, -16)], and IDA [-75% (95% CI: -92, -20)]. The soluble transferrin receptor [-10% (95% CI: -16, -4)] concentration was lower, whereas the hemoglobin (Hb) [2.7 g/L (95% CI: 0.4, 5.1)] and plasma ferritin [40% (95% CI: 10, 95)] concentrations increased in the MNP group. There was no significant change in Hb or iron status in the amaranth group. Consumption of maize porridge fortified with low-dose, highly bioavailable iron MNP can reduce the prevalence of IDA in preschool children. In contrast, fortification with amaranth grain did not improve iron status despite a large increase in iron intake, likely due to high ratio of phytic acid:iron in the meal.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) and anemia are major challenges among children and expecting and lactating mothers in developing countries. Intervention with locally available dark green leafy vegetables (DGLV) is more sustainable to eradicate VAD, being cost-effective and readily adaptable to local communities. DGLV contain high levels of iron and β-carotene (BC) and therefore useful in fighting VAD and anemia. Since DGLVs are season-dependent sun-drying enables their availability during low seasons. However, their contribution to the bioavailability of BC and the improvement of hemoglobin are not well understood. The study therefore investigated the effect of consuming cooked recipe consisting of sun-dried amaranth and cowpea leaves on the levels of BC, retinol, and hemoglobin in preschool children from Machakos District, a semiarid region in Kenya. METHODS: Vegetables were purchased from local vegetable market, with some sun-dried in an open shade. Levels of BC and retinol in serum and BC in fresh and processed vegetables were determined by a HPLC method and hemoglobin using a portable Hemocue Analyzer. RESULTS: All-trans-BC levels in uncooked fresh cowpea and amaranth leaves were 806.0 μg/g and 599.0 μg/g dry matter, respectively, while the dehydration and cooking processes retained the β-carotene levels at over 60 %. Consumption of the dehydrated vegetables significantly improved both serum BC and retinol levels (p < 0.05), while the baseline hemoglobin levels improved by 4.6 %. CONCLUSION: The study has shown that intervention with locally available sun-dried vegetables improves the bioavailability of BC, retinol, and hemoglobin levels among preschool children.",
