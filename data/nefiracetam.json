      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To evaluate the efficacy of treatment with nefiracetam compared to placebo in poststroke apathy. METHODS: A parallel group, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind two-center trial in patients with recent stroke and apathy was conducted in 2 tertiary teaching hospitals in Perth, Western Australia, between March 2010 and October 2014. Consenting patients hospitalized with stroke were screened for participation at the time of hospitalization and, if diagnosed with apathy 8-36 weeks later, they were randomized to 12 weeks of 900 mg/day nefiracetam or placebo. The primary efficacy parameter was change in apathy at 12 weeks defined by the 14-item Apathy Scale (AS). RESULTS: Of 2514 patients screened, only 377 (15%) were eligible for the study after the first screening, 233 declined further participation, and 144 were assessed for apathy at 8-36 weeks post stroke to confirm eligibility. Twenty patients out of 106 with a complete psychiatric assessment had apathy (19%). Of this sample, 13 patients were randomized. Overall, the AS score decreased by a mean of 7.0 points (95% CI = -14.6 to .6), but there was no significant between-group difference at week 12 (mean paired t-tests, P > .14). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with nefiracetam did not prove to be more efficacious than placebo in ameliorating apathy in stroke. The main limitation was the very small sample randomized, highlighting the limitations of conducting drug trials for behavioral problems among stroke patients. Pharmacological studies of apathy in stroke will require a large multicenter study and a massive sample of patients.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: Stroke patients are at a high risk of developing post-ischemic seizures and cognitive impairment. Nefiracetam (NEF), a pyrrolidone derivative, has been shown to possess both anti-epileptic and cognitive-enhancing properties. In this study the anti-seizure effects of NEF were evaluated in a rat model of post-ischemic nonconvulsive seizures (NCSs). Its potential mechanisms were investigated in neuronal cell culture assays of neurotoxicity associated with ischemic brain injury and epileptogenesis. MAIN METHODS: In the in vivo study, rats received 24h permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. NEF was administered intravenously either at 15 min post-injury but prior to the first NCS event (30 mg/kg, pre-NCS treatment) or immediately after the first NCS occurred (30 or 60 mg/kg, post-NCS treatment). In the in vitro study, neuronal cell cultures were exposed to veratridine or glutamate and treated with NEF (1-500 nM). KEY FINDINGS: The NEF pre-NCS treatment significantly reduced the NCS frequency and duration, whereas the higher NEF dose (60 mg/kg) was required to achieve similar effects when given after NCS occurred. The NEF treatment also dose-dependently (5-500 nM) protected against neuronal cell death induced by veratridine as measured by MTT cell viability assay, but higher doses (250-500 nM) were required against glutamate toxicity. SIGNIFICANCE: The anti-seizure property of NEF was demonstrated in a clinically relevant rat model of post-ischemic NCS. The preferential effects of NEF against in vitro veratridine toxicity suggest the involvement of its modulation of sodium channel malfunction. Future studies are warranted to study the mechanisms of NEF against ischemic brain injury and post-ischemic seizures.",

      "abstract": "Aberrant behaviors related to learning and memory in olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) mice have been documented in the previous studies. We reported that the impairment of long-term potentiation (LTP) of hippocampal CA1 regions from OBX mice was associated with down-regulation of CaM kinase II (CaMKII) and protein kinase C (PKC) activities. We now demonstrated that the nootropic drug, nefiracetam, significantly improved spatial reference memory-related behaviors as assessed by Y-maze and novel object recognition task in OBX mice. Nefiracetam also restored hippocampal LTP injured in OBX mice. Nefiracetam treatment restored LTP-induced PKCalpha (Ser657) and NR1 (Ser896) phosphorylation as well as increase in their basal phosphorylation in the hippocampal CA1 region of OBX mice. Likewise, nefiracetam improved LTP-induced CaMKIIalpha (Thr286) autophosphorylation and GluR1 (Ser831) phosphorylation and increased their basal phosphorylation. The enhancement of PKCalpha (Ser657) and CaMKIIalpha (Thr286) autophosphorylation by nefiracetam was inhibited by treatment with (+/-)-alpha-Methyl-(4-carboxyphenyl)glycine and DL-2-Amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid, respectively. The enhancement of LTP induced by nefiracetam is inhibited by treatment with 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine, but not by treatment with LY367385, suggesting that metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) but not mGluR1 is involved in the nefiracetam-induced LTP enhancement. Taken together, nefiracetam ameliorates OBX-induced deficits in memory-related behaviors and impairment of LTP in the hippocampal CA1 region through activation of NMDAR and mGluR5, thereby leading to an increase in activities of CaMKIIalpha (Thr286) and PKCalpha (Ser657), respectively.",

Interestingly, chronic intraperitoneal administration (1 mg/kg/day) of nefiracetam (DM-9384), a prototype cognitive enhancer, significantly improved depressive-like behaviors as well as spatial reference memory assessed by Y-maze task. As previously reported (Moriguchi, S., Han, F., Nakagawasai, O., Tadano, T., Fukunaga, K., 2006. Decreased calcium/calmoculin-dependent protein kinase II and protein kinase C activities mediate impairment of hippocampal long-term potentiation in the olfactory bulbectomized mice. J. Neurochem. 97, 22-29), decreased activities of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the hippocampal CA1 region and amygdala were observed in OBX mice. Nefiracetam treatment (1 mg/kg/day) significantly elevated CaMKII but not ERK activities in the amygdala, prefrontal cortex and hippocampal CA1 regions. In addition, we found an elevation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex but not in the hippocampal CA1 region. Increased CREB phosphorylation was associated with activation of CaMKI and CaMKIV as well as CaMKII in these regions. Taken together, in addition to CaMKII, CaMKI and CaMKIV activation mediated by nefiracetam treatment might mediate CREB phosphorylation following chronic nefiracetam treatment, thereby eliciting an anti-depressive and cognition-enhancing effect on OBX mice.",

      "abstract": "Nefiracetam is a pyrrolidine-related nootropic drug exhibiting various pharmacological actions such as cognitive-enhancing effect. We previously showed that nefiracetam potentiates NMDA-induced currents in cultured rat cortical neurons. To address questions whether nefiracetam affects NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, we assessed effects of nefiracetam on NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) by electrophysiology and LTP-induced phosphorylation of synaptic proteins by immunoblotting analysis. Nefiracetam treatment at 1-1000 nM increased the slope of fEPSPs in a dose-dependent manner. The enhancement was associated with increased phosphorylation of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptor through activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) without affecting synapsin I phosphorylation. In addition, nefiracetam treatment increased PKCalpha activity in a bell-shaped dose-response curve which peaked at 10 nM, thereby increasing phosphorylation of myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate and NMDA receptor. Nefiracetam treatment did not affect protein kinase A activity. Consistent with the bell-shaped PKCalpha activation, nefiracetam treatment enhanced LTP in the rat hippocampal CA1 region with the same bell-shaped dose-response curve. Furthermore, nefiracetam-induced LTP enhancement was closely associated with CaMKII and PKCalpha activation with concomitant increases in phosphorylation of their endogenous substrates except for synapsin I. These results suggest that nefiracetam potentiates AMPA receptor-mediated fEPSPs through CaMKII activation and enhances NMDA receptor-dependent LTP through potentiation of the post-synaptic CaMKII and protein kinase C activities. Together with potentiation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor function, nefiracetam-enhanced AMPA and NMDA receptor functions likely contribute to improvement of cognitive function.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Recent studies have shown that nefiracetam ameliorates cognitive dysfunction because of ischemia when behavioral testing occurs during treatment. We sought to determine if there was a persistent effect after treatment, by testing spatial learning of embolized rats after nefiracetam therapy. METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats (250 to 300 g) were divided into 3 categories. The control group (n = 5) underwent no surgery or cerebral embolism. The vehicle group (n = 12) was anesthetized with halothane, underwent surgery, injected with intracarotid microspheres, and given orally 5 mL/kg of the vehicle (0.5% aqueous sodium carboxymethyl cellulose) for 21 days. The nefiracetam group (n = 12) was embolized and treated orally with 30 mg/kg nefiracetam (6 mg/mL in vehicle) for 21 days. Outcome was determined with visual spatial learning after the end of treatment. RESULTS: Embolization caused a significant impairment in visual spatial learning, which nefiracetam completely ameliorated (group main effect, F(2,444) = 6.4, P = .002). Mean latency to the escape was 35 +/- 6 seconds for the vehicle group versus 18 +/- 4 seconds for the nefiracetam group, after 4 days of testing. This effect persisted after a further interval of 10 days (retention test). A reversal test (to assess working memory for new information) yielded mean latencies of 26 +/- 6 seconds for the control group, 49 +/- 5 seconds for vehicle, and 25 +/- 4 seconds for nefiracetam (group main effect, F(2,109) = 8.0, P = .0005, Newman-Keuls, P < .05), showing that both the control and nefiracetam groups were different from the vehicle group. CONCLUSION: Nefiracetam therapy improves the learning behavior of embolized rats. The results are not caused by an activating effect of the drug because the animals are tested after the treatment period is over and because the beneficial effect is seen using the delayed retention test. Finally, working memory is markedly preserved by nefiracetam, an effect observed several weeks after treatment."

      "abstract": "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are known to be down-regulated in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients. We have previously demonstrated that the nootropic drug nefiracetam potentiates the activity of both nicotinic acetylcholine and NMDA receptors and that nefiracetam modulates the glycine binding site of the NMDA receptor. Because the NMDA receptor is also modulated by Mg2+ and protein kinases, we studied their roles in nefiracetam action on the NMDA receptor by the whole-cell patch-clamp technique and immunoblotting analysis using rat cortical or hippocampal neurons in primary culture. The nefiracetam potentiation of NMDA currents was inhibited by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor chelerythrine, but not by the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor N-[2-(4-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinoline (H89). In immunoblotting analysis, nefiracetam treatment increased the PKCalpha activity with a bell-shaped dose-response relationship peaking at 10 nM, thereby increasing phosphorylation of PKC substrate and NMDA receptor. Such an increase in PKCalpha-mediated phosphorylation was prevented by chelerythine. Nefiracetam treatment did not affect the PKA activity. Analysis of the current-voltage relationships revealed that nefiracetam at 10 nM largely eliminated voltage-dependent Mg2+ block and that this action of nefiracetam was sensitive to PKC inhibition. It was concluded that nefiracetam potentiated NMDA currents not by acting as a partial agonist but by interacting with PKC, allosterically enhancing glycine binding, and attenuating voltage-dependent Mg2+ block.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Nefiracetam (NEF) is a novel pyrrolidonetype nootropic agent, and it has been reported to possess various pharmacologic effects as well as cognition-enhancing effects. The present study focused on the effects of NEF in amygdala-kindled seizures and its potential for antiepileptic therapy. METHODS: Effects of NEF on fully amygdala-kindled seizures and development of amygdala-kindled seizures were investigated in rats and compared with those of levetiracetam (LEV), a pyrrolidone-type antiepileptic drug (AED). RESULTS: In fully amygdala-kindled rats, NEF (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) decreased afterdischarge induction, afterdischarge duration, seizure stage, and motor seizure duration in a dose-dependent manner. LEV (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) had no effects on afterdischarge induction and slightly decreased afterdischarge duration, whereas it markedly decreased seizure stage and motor seizure duration. In contrast to the results in fully amygdala-kindled rats, NEF (25 and 50 mg/kg/day, p.o.) had few or no effects on the development of amygdala-kindled seizures. As well as fully amygdala-kindled seizures, LEV (50 mg/kg/day, p.o.) markedly inhibited the development of behavioral seizures without reducing daily afterdischarge duration. CONCLUSIONS: Although NEF possesses potent anticonvulsant effects on fully amygdala-kindled seizures, it has few or no effects on the development of amygdala-kindled seizures. LEV shows marked anticonvulsant effects on both phases of kindling. In fully amygdala-kindled rats, NEF inhibits both electroencephalographic and behavioral seizures, whereas LEV inhibits only behavioral seizures. This double dissociation suggests that NEF has a distinct anticonvulsant spectrum and mechanisms from those of LEV.",

We investigated the anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects of nefiracetam in kainic acid-induced seizures of rats, compared with levetiracetam and standard antiepileptic drugs. Subcutaneous injection of kainic acid (10 mg/kg) induced typical behavioral seizures such as wet dog shakes and limbic seizures and histopathological changes in the hippocampus (degeneration and loss of pyramidal cells in CA1 to CA4 areas). Nefiracetam (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg po) had no effect on the behavioral seizures and dose-dependently inhibited the hippocampal damage. In contrast, levetiracetam, a pyrrolidone-type antiepileptic drug, inhibited neither. Valproic acid and ethosuximide prevented the hippocampal damage without attenuating the behavioral seizures as nefiracetam. Zonisamide and phenytoin did not inhibit the behavioral seizures, while zonisamide enhanced the hippocampal damage and phenytoin increased the lethality rate. Carbamazepine inhibited the behavioral seizures at 50 mg/kg and enhanced that at 100 mg/kg, and it completely inhibited the hippocampal damage at both doses. We have previously reported that anticonvulsant spectrum of nefiracetam paralleled that of zonisamide, phenytoin or carbamazepine in standard screening models. However, the pharmacological profile of nefiracetam was closer to valproic acid or ethosuximide than that of zonisamide, phenytoin or carbamazepine in this study. These results suggest that anticonvulsant spectrum and mechanism of nefiracetam are distinct from those of standard antiepileptic drugs, and nefiracetam possesses a neuroprotective effect that is unrelated to seizure inhibition.",

The present study focused on the anticonvulsant effect of NEF and its potential for antiepileptic therapy. METHODS: The anticonvulsant properties of NEF were investigated in experimental seizure models of mice and rats, compared with levetiracetam (LEV) and other standard antiepileptic drugs [AEDs; zonisamide (ZNS), phenytoin (PHT), carbamazepine (CBZ), valproic acid (VPA), diazepam (DZP), and ethosuximide (ESM)]. With reference to standard programs for evaluating potential AEDs, the study included the traditional maximal electroshock seizure and subcutaneous chemoconvulsant (pentylenetetrazole, bicuculline, picrotoxin, strychnine, or N-methyl-D-aspartate) seizure tests and two threshold models (the increasing-current electroshock seizure test and intravenous pentylenetetrazole seizure threshold test). Neurotoxic activities were examined with the rotarod test and traction test. RESULTS: NEF inhibited electroshock-induced seizures at nontoxic doses, whereas it had no effect on seizures chemically induced by pentylenetetrazole, bicuculline, picrotoxin, strychnine, or N-methyl-D-aspartate. The anticonvulsant spectrum of NEF paralleled that of ZNS, PHT, and CBZ. The anticonvulsant efficacy of NEF was comparable with that of ZNS and less potent than that of PHT, CBZ, and DZP. However, the safety margin of NEF was superior to that of ZNS, CBZ, VPA, and DZP. LEV showed only slight anticonvulsant effects in threshold models, and it was not effective in conventional screening models. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that NEF has distinct anticonvulsant spectrum and mechanisms from those of LEV. NEF is an orally active and safe AED, and it possesses a potential for antiepileptic therapy.",

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether nefiracetam has an effect on the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and synapsin I mRNAs that are believed to be produced via CREB, and the alteration in their protein contents in the hippocampus after cerebral ischemia. Sustained cerebral ischemia was induced by injection of 700 microspheres into the right hemisphere of each rat. The rats were treated once daily with 10 mg/kg nefiracetam, p.o., from 15 h after the operation. Treatment with nefiracetam reduced the prolongation of the escape latency in the water maze test on days 7-9 after microsphere embolism-induced sustained cerebral ischemia, suggesting an improvement in the spatial learning function. Microsphere-embolized rats on day 5 showed decreases in BDNF and synapsin I mRNA levels and their protein contents in the ipsilateral hippocampus. Treatment with nefiracetam partially attenuated the decreases. These results suggest that enhancement of BDNF and synapsin I expression by nefiracetam treatment may be, at least in part, due to the improvement in the CREB binding activity, contributing to the prevention of learning and memory dysfunction after sustained cerebral ischemia.",

Time-course changes in serum and/or testicular hormone levels and semen parameters, and testicular morphology were examined. The testicular testosterone level was decreased 4 h after single administration of nefiracetam at 300 mg/kg per day, but the progesterone level showed no change at that time. The serum testosterone level was decreased after single, 1-week or 2-week treatment. In contrast, the serum estradiol level was increased from 1- to 4-week treatment. No changes in serum LH, FSH and inhibin B levels were observed throughout the experimental period. Decreased sperm motility and increased number of malformed sperms were first observed in semen after 4-week treatment. Histopathological examination of the testis revealed moderate and severe seminiferous atrophy with multinucleated giant cell formation at 180 and 300 mg/kg per day, respectively, after 4-week treatment, but not 1-week treatment. These results show that nefiracetam decreases testicular testosterone level in dogs following single oral administration of a high dose, and induces severe morphologic changes after 4-week treatment. This reduction is shown to be a sensitive parameter to detect the toxicity, and is suggested to be induced by the impaired conversion of progesterone to testosterone in Leydig cells.",

      "abstract": "Nefiracetam is a new pyrrolidone nootropic drug being developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's type and post-stroke vascular-type dementia. In the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients, down-regulation of both cholinergic and glutamatergic systems has been found and is thought to play an important role in impairment of cognition, learning and memory. We have previously shown that the activity of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors is potently augmented by nefiracetam. The present study was undertaken to elucidate the mechanism of action of nefiracetam on glutamatergic receptors. Currents were recorded from rat cortical neurons in long-term primary culture using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique at a holding potential of -70 mV in Mg2+-free solutions. N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-evoked currents were greatly and reversibly potentiated by bath application of nefiracetam resulting in a bell-shaped dose-response curve. The minimum effective nefiracetam concentration was 1 nM, and the maximum potentiation to 170% of the control was produced at 10 nM. Nefiracetam potentiation occurred at high NMDA concentrations that evoked the saturated response, and in a manner independent of NMDA concentrations ranging from 3 to 1,000 microM. Glycine at 3 microM potentiated NMDA currents but this effect was attenuated with an increasing concentration of nefiracetam from 1 to 10,000 nM. 7-Chlorokynurenic acid at 1 microM prevented nefiracetam from potentiating NMDA currents. Nefiracetam at 10 nM shifted the dose-response relationship for the 7-chlorokynurenic acid inhibition of NMDA currents in the direction of higher concentrations. Alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid- and kainate-induced currents were not significantly affected by application of 10 nM nefiracetam. It was concluded that nefiracetam potentiated NMDA currents through interactions with the glycine binding site of the NMDA receptor.",

Sustained cerebral ischemia in the right cerebral hemisphere was induced by an injection of microspheres into the right internal carotid artery of rats. To examine learning and memory function, the water maze test was performed from day 7 to day 10 after the operation. The escape latency of the microsphere-embolized (ME) rat in the water maze task was longer than that of the sham-operated (Sham) rat, suggesting that spatial memory dysfunction occurred in the ME rat. Gsalpha and Gi(1/2)alpha protein levels in the cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus of the ME rat, when determined on day 11, were similar to those of the Sham rats. The basal AC activity in the striatum, but not in the other two regions, of the ME rat decreased. The AC activity in the presence of 10 microM colforsin daropate (Col), a direct stimulator of AC, was increased by approximately 20-fold in sham animals and 7- to 10-fold in the ME rat. Treatment of the ME rat with 10 mg/kg/d nefiracetam p.o. from day 1 to day 10 after the operation shortened the escape latency, restored the basal AC activity in the striatum, and reversed the Col-induced increases in AC in these three regions without any changes in the cerebral Gsalpha and Gi(1/2)alpha protein levels. These results suggest that nefiracetam-mediated activation of AC activity may contribute to the improvement of memory and learning function in sustained cerebral ischemia.",

To delineate its pathogenesis, we established the primary culture of uroepithelial cells of the canine urinary bladder, and then explored the effect of nefiracetam on the cultured cells. Uroepithelial cells scraped from the connective tissues of the urinary bladder of naive dogs were suspended in the minimum essential medium containing dispase, and then resuspended in the keratinocyte medium to be 6.0-7.0 x 10(5) cells/ml. Afterward, they were added to an apical chamber with a 12-mm transwell filter, cultured for three days, and recultured in the keratinocyte medium containing 1 mM CaCl(2) for 20 days. Microscopically, these cultured cells consisted of three cell layers with high transepithelial electric resistance (TER; > 10,000 ohm-cm(2)). Immunofluorescence observations revealed ZO-1 and E-cadherin bands, and electron microscopic examinations displayed the superficial cells with the assembly of tight junctions. When the effect of nefiracetam and its five main metabolites (M-3, M-10, M-11, M-18, and M-20) on TER and the ZO-1 band was assessed using cultured cells, only M-18 significantly reduced TER in the coculture for 48 h or more. Both M-10 and M-18 exhibited a deformation of uroepithelial cells and a slight reduction of the ZO-1 band from 120 h later. In conclusion, this culture system possesses both functional and morphological features of the uroepithelium reflected in vivo, and M-18 may play a pivotal role in the impairment of uroepithelial cells, leading to the onset of the urinary bladder lesion in dogs due to nefiracetam.",

ME decreased Ca(2+)/calmodulin (CaM)-stimulated AC (AC-I) activity, cAMP content, cytosolic PKA Cbeta level, nuclear PKA Calpha and Cbeta levels, and reduced the phosphorylation and DNA-binding activity of CREB in the nucleus in the right parietal cortex and hippocampus on day 3 after ME. The ME-induced changes in these variables did not occur by the delayed treatment with nefiracetam. 6. These results suggest that nefiracetam preserved cognitive function, or prevented cognitive dysfunction, after sustained cerebral ischaemia and that the effect is, in part, attributable to the prevention of the ischaemia-induced impairment of the AC/cAMP/PKA/CREB signal transduction pathway.",

      "abstract": "The present study was aimed at determining whether nefiracetam might have a persistent cognition-enhancing effect in animals with sustained cerebral ischemia. Sustained cerebral ischemia was induced by injecting 700 microspheres into the right internal carotid artery of rats [microsphere-embolized (ME) rats]. The ME and sham-operated rats were treated with 10 mg/kg/day nefiracetam p.o. from the first to the 9th day after the operation. The escape latency of the ME rat in the water maze test, when performed on days 7 to 9 after the operation, was lengthened. This effect was attenuated by the delayed treatment with nefiracetam. The nefiracetam-treated ME rat showed a shortened escape latency in the retention test on day 17 as well as in the contraposition test on day 18. These results indicate that a persistent improvement of the spatial memory function impaired by sustained cerebral ischemia was achieved even after cessation of treatment with nefiracetam. The functional damage to learning and memory was associated with decreases in the membranous adenylyl cyclase I and cytosolic protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunit and regulatory subunit proteins in the right hippocampus and cerebral cortex. The delayed treatment with nefiracetam appreciably prevented the decreases in these proteins. The present study suggests that nefiracetam may have an ability to cause persistent improvement of learning and memory function, possibly through protection against the ischemia-induced impairment to the adenylyl cyclase/cAMP/PKA signal transduction pathway.",

Nefiracetam (1 microM) induced a sustained facilitation of postsynaptic responses in the dentate gyrus of hippocampal slices from wild-type mice. The facilitation occluded the potentiation induced by high-frequency stimulation at the perforant path, and vice versa, suggesting a common mechanism between them. The perforant path long-term potentiation (LTP) was not induced in epsilon1 subunit knock-out mice, but nefiracetam (1 microM) persistently potentiated PS amplitude, reaching 280% of basal levels 50 min after 10-min treatment, similar to the potentiation achieved with wild-type mice. The results of the present study, thus, suggest that nefiracetam exerts its facilitatory action on hippocampal postsynaptic responses in an NMDA receptor-independent manner.",

Sustained cerebral ischemia was induced by the injection of 700 microspheres into the right hemisphere of the rat. The animals were treated once daily with 10 mg/kg nefiracetam p.o. from 15 h after the operation to either 10 days for the water maze study, or 3 or 5 days after the operation for neurochemical examination. Microsphere-embolized rats showed stroke-like symptoms 15 h after the operation and lengthened the escape latency in the water maze task on days 7-10, suggesting a spatial learning dysfunction. The delayed treatment did not reduce the stroke-like symptoms, but effectively shortened the escape latency. The animals at days 3 and 5 after the operation showed decreases in acetylcholine content and choline acetyltransferase activity, which were not prevented by nefiracetam. The microsphere-embolized rats showed decreases in GABA content and glutamic acid decarboxylase activity. The delayed treatment appreciably restored GABA content in the hippocampus on day 5 and reversed glutamic acid decarboxylase activity in both brain regions on day 5. These results suggest that the GABAergic activity rather than the cholinergic activity may be, at least in part, involved in the pharmacological effects of nefiracetam in the ischemic brain.",

Recent studies have implicated relationships between learning, memory, and chronic pain. Thus, in the present report, we have studied the effects of nootropic drug nefiracetam on the thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia induced by partial sciatic nerve ligation or streptozotocin treatment in mice. In the thermal paw withdrawal test, p.o., s.c., i.t., and i.c.v. administration of nefiracetam dose dependently reversed the thermal hyperalgesia observed in nerve-injured mice. Nefiracetam (p.o. and i.t.) also significantly reversed the thermal hyperalgesia observed in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. In the paw pressure test, p.o. and i.t. administration of nefiracetam dose dependently reversed the mechanical hyperalgesia observed in both nerve-injured and diabetic mice. In contrast, nefiracetam had no effect in sham-operated or control nondiabetic mice in all paradigms. Among other pyrrolidine nootropics (p.o.), aniracetam produced significant analgesic effects. Other analogs also had some, but not significant, analgesic effects. Finally, nefiracetam (p.o.)-induced analgesia in injured mice was not affected by opioid antagonist naloxone (s.c., i.t., and i.c.v.) but was dose dependently inhibited by nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine (i.t. and i.c.v.). The analgesic effect of i.t. nefiracetam was also blocked by i.t. mecamylamine pretreatment. Together, these findings suggest that nefiracetam, a new member of the piracetam group of cognition enhancers, could be a good therapeutic tool against neuropathic pain. We also demonstrate that nefiracetam-induced analgesic action was nonopioid in nature and was due to stimulation of nicotinic cholinergic system at spinal and supraspinal levels.",

This deficit was fully reversed by long-term pretreatment with the nootropic nefiracetam, which in fact obtained supranormal performance.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The cognition-enhancing drug, nefiracetam, is in Phase III clinical trials to treat memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nefiracetam ameliorates acquisition of delay eyeblink classical conditioning in older rabbits, a form of associative learning with striking behavioral and neurobiological similarities in rabbits and humans. In both species, delay eyeblink conditioning engages the septo-hippocampal cholinergic system and is disrupted when the cholinergic system is antagonized. Delay eyeblink classical conditioning is impaired in normal aging and severely disrupted in AD. MATERIAL/METHODS: To test further the efficacy of nefiracetam in an animal model that mimics some of the neurobiological and behavioral effects present in AD, we tested 56 older rabbits assigned to 7 treatment groups in the 750 ms delay eyeblink conditioning procedure. Older rabbits were injected with 1.5 mg/kg scopolamine to simulate disruption of the cholinergic system in AD. Three doses of nefiracetam (5, 10, or 15 mg/kg) were also injected in older rabbits receiving 1.5 mg/kg scopolamine. Control groups were treated with 1.5 mg/kg scopolamine + vehicle, vehicle alone, or explicitly unpaired presentations of conditioning stimuli and vehicle or 1.5 mg/kg scopolamine + 15 mg/kg nefiracetam. RESULTS: Rabbits injected with 1.5 mg/kg scopolamine alone were impaired, but a dose of 15 mg/kg nefiracetam reversed significantly the behavioral impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Nefiracetam had ameliorating effects on a task impaired in AD in an animal model of AD: older rabbits with cholinergic system antagonism.",

Twenty-minute ischemic insult to slices, i.e., deprivation of glucose and oxygen from artificial cerebrospinal fluid, abolished PSs. As compared with only 35% recovery of the PS amplitude for control, PS amplitude reversed to 65% of basal levels 40 min after returning normal conditions by treatment with nefiracetam (0.01 microM). Ischemic insult reduced the levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and creatine phosphate (CrP) in slices, and when returned to normal conditions, recovering to 70 and 85% of basal values, respectively, 30 min after returning normal conditions. Nefiracetam (0.01 microM) facilitated the recovery of ATP and CrP, reaching 110 and 140% of basal values, respectively. Nefiracetam inhibited N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-evoked currents to 35% of basal amplitudes. Likewise, nefiracetam (0.01 microM) inhibited intracellular Ca(2+) rise through NMDA receptor channels to 30% of basal levels. The results of the present study, thus, suggest that nefiracetam has the potential to protect against ischemic brain damage, possibly in part by preventing from accumulation of intracellular calcium through NMDA receptor channels.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of the chronic postinjury administration of nefiracetam (DM-9384) in improving cognitive performance following central fluid percussion brain injury in rats. Twenty-four hours following surgical preparation, a sham injury or a moderate fluid percussive injury (2.1 atm) was delivered. Nefiracetam was administered chronically (0 or 9 mg/kg, po, for sham animals and 0, 3, or 9 mg/kg for injured animals) on postinjury days 1-15. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Morris water maze (MWM) on postinjury days 11-15. Chronic administration of 3 and 9 mg/kg nefiracetam attenuated MWM deficits produced by central fluid percussive brain injury. Importantly, the MWM performance of the injured animals treated with 9 mg/kg did not significantly differ from uninjured, sham animals. The 9-mg/kg dose of nefiracetam did not have a positive or negative effect on MWM performance of uninjured animals. The results of the present experiment suggest that a nootropic such as nefiracetam may be an appropriate treatment for trauma-induced cognitive dysfunction.",

Treatment with nefiracetam (10 mg/kg, p.o.) produced a significant increase in the level of ACh in the brain dialysate, compared with the vehicle-treated group. This enhancing effect was also observed when the ACh level was elevated by administration of scopolamine (1 mg/kg, i.p.) at 45 min after the treatment with nefiracetam. In addition, perfusion of nefiracetam at the concentration of 10 microM significantly increased the extracellular ACh level in the frontal cortex of basal forebrain (BF)-lesioned rats, in which a marked decrease of the basal ACh level was observed in this region. These results suggest that enhancement of cortical ACh release by nefiracetam may contribute to an anti-amnesic effect on the learning deficits induced by treatment of scopolamine or BF-lesion in rats.",

In behavioral experiments in rats, nefiracetam (3 mg/kg) ameliorated amnesia induced by basal forebrain (BF) lesion or treatment of scopolamine. Biochemical experiments revealed that nefiracetam increased uptake and release of transmitters in both cholinergic and GABAergic systems in rat brain. In electrophysiological studies, nefiracetam (1 microM) increased long-lasting (N/L-type) Ca2+ channel currents in NG108-15 cells. The nefiracetam action on Ca2+ channels was blocked by pertussis toxin (PTX). The results suggest that nefiracetam improves impaired memory by facilitating cholinergic and GABAergic transmissions in the brain. It is further suggested that PTX-sensitive G-proteins and Ca2+ channels associated with these G-proteins are responsible for the action of nefiracetam on neurotransmission.",

Each dog was sacrificed after each treatment period, and urinalysis and serum biochemistry were performed for surviving dogs at several time points. One male and 2 females died during week 10 or 11. Degeneration and desquamation of epithelial cells and edema and hemorrhage in the lamina propria were observed in the urinary bladder after 1 wk of treatment. These changes became severe as time progressed and were reflected in the clinical abnormalities of hematuria and increased protein excretion in urine. However, epithelial regeneration and hyperplasia were seen thereafter, and almost no change was seen in the urinary bladder after treatment for 11 wk. Instead of recovery as in the urinary bladder, the kidney showed epithelial degeneration and hyperplasia in the papilla and collecting duct and interstitial congestion and hemorrhage after treatment for 11 wk. Extensive hemorrhage and papillary necrosis were seen in animals that died during week 10 or 11 of dosing. These kidney changes were associated with increased urinary volume and decreased osmotic pressure. The lesions are thought to have a common etiopathogenesis and to be initiated by the epithelial damage with a time lag between expression of injury in the urinary bladder and the kidney.",

      "abstract": "Sprague-Dawley male rats were administered nefiracetam orally at daily doses of 500 and 1500 mg/kg/day for 4 or 9 weeks. Although the copulation index was not affected by nefiracetam treatment, the fertility index was extremely low in the 1500 mg/kg/day group for both treatment periods. This high dose group consistently exhibited decreased testicular weights. Epididymal and prostate weights were also reduced in the 1500 mg/kg/day group after both 4- and 9-week treatments and in the 500 mg/kg/day group after the 9-week treatment. Severe degenerative changes such as degeneration of germ cells, loss of germ cells and atrophy of seminiferous tubules were observed in all rats of the 1500 mg/kg/day groups after both 4 and 9 weeks of treatment. Retention of spermatids in stage IX, X and XI seminiferous tubules was also noted after the 4- and 9-week treatments at 500 mg/kg/day. The testicular sperm head counts were markedly decreased following the 4- and 9-week treatments at 1500 mg/kg/day, and mildly reduced after the 4-weeks treatment at 500 mg/kg/day. From these results it is concluded that histopathological examination and the testicular sperm head count method are highly useful for detecting testicular toxicity and that testicular lesions caused by nefiracetam can be detected after 4 weeks of exposure.",

In the present study, the effects of nefiracetam on the brain monoamine systems were studied. Male, adult Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with nefiracetam in single doses (0, 1, 3, 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg, p.o.) and analyzed after 1 and 4 hr, or treated by daily doses (0, 1, 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg, p.o.) for 2 weeks. In general, no or only weak effects were observed on tissue monoamine levels, either following acute or 14 days treatment with nefiracetam. Acute administration of intermediate doses of nefiracetam induced minor increases in dopamine (DA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) tissue levels in the striatum, while hypothalamic 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) decreased at 1 hr. Noradrenaline (NA) and serotonin (5-HT) levels increased in some regions after higher doses of nefiracetam. Increases in 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were also seen at 4 hr, but only after the 3 mg/kg dose. Minor decreases of HVA and DOPAC levels were seen in some regions after treatment with various doses of nefiracetam for 14 days, while an increase in 5-HT levels was observed occasionally. Using in vivo microdialysis in freely moving animals, no significant effects on extracellular levels of HVA, DOPAC and 5-HIAA in the striatum or of HVA, DOPAC and NA levels in the dorsal hippocampus were seen after acute administration of nefiracetam. On the other hand, extracellular hippocampal 5-HIAA levels decreased by 20% after the 1 and 3 mg/kg doses. Nefiracetam, in a concentration range of 1 nM to 10 microM, did not affect the in vitro synaptosomal uptake of [3H]NA and [3H]5-HT in the cortex or of [3H]DA in the striatum. Taken together, nefiracetam appears to exert minor, regionally restricted and not dose-dependent effects on the monoamine systems following either acute or repeated administrations in normal rats. A direct or indirect, possible GABA-mediated, influence of nefiracetam may underlie the modest changes seen on monoamines. The cognitive-enhancing action of nefiracetam does not seem to be related to effects on presynaptic monoamine functions.",

The compound was administered in diet for 104 weeks at dosage levels of 30, 90 and 270 mg/kg/d for mice and of 200, 600 and 1800 ppm for rats. The administration of nefiracetam produced no effects on survival, appearance or behavior. Body weights of the high dose male mice and rats were occasionally significantly decreased when compared to the controls. When calculated on a g/animal/d basis, food consumption was sometimes decreased for these male groups. At necropsy, there was no evidence of treatment related changes, nor were these seen on histopathological examination. All microscopic changes seen in mice and rats were of the usual type commonly occurring in untreated aged B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats. In conclusion, the administration of nefiracetam for 24 months to B6C3F1 mice and F344/DuCrj rats produced only slight effects on body weight in the high dose males with a no-effect level of 90 mg/kg/d for mice or 600 ppm for rats. There was no evidence of an oncogenic effect of nefiracetam.",

In the cytogenetic study, nefiracetam caused a slight but significant increase of chromosomal aberration at the highest dose in the 48 h treatment group, but no mutagenicity was observed with the same indicator in the in vivo micronucleus test. Furthermore, nefiracetam did not show any positive response in the reverse mutation test.

Signs of systemic toxicity, as indicated by the laboratory investigations, were not apparent until the second half of the study and included the principal findings of higher urea nitrogen, and creatinine, with higher urinary volumes and corresponding lower specific gravity, osmolarity and protein values. The microscopic pathology examination showed various changes at the renal papilla, collecting ducts, and medullary and cortical scarring. This examination also revealed decreased spermatogenesis in the testes, with associated decreased numbers/absence of spermatozoa in the epididymides. At the 30 mg/kg/d level, the minor microscopic pathology changes seen in the kidneys of one male animal were considered to be of equivocal toxicological importance.

Histopathological changes in the liver, centrilobullar hepatocyte enlargement (accompanied by fine vacuolation) and foci/areas of eosinophilic hepatocytes were considered to reflect the induction of drug-metabolising enzymes in the liver. Other tissues showing treatment-related findings included the salivary glands, urinary bladder, spleen, pancreas and adrenals. Additionally, other notable findings included (in the high dosage males only) a decline in body weight (from week 34), lower erythrocytic characteristics and slightly higher plasma urea nitrogen and alkaline phosphatase values. The results in this study, therefore, indicated that the non-toxic effect level was 10 mg/kg/d of nefiracetam.",
